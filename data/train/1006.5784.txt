    "quantum entanglement plays an important role in the quantum communication protocols like teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , remote state preparation @xcite , cryptography @xcite and many more .",
    "however , the precise role of entanglement in quantum information processing still remains an open question .",
    "it is not clear , whether all the information processing tasks can be done more efficiently with a quantum system that requires entanglement as a resource .",
    "in addition , precise nature of the quantum correlations is not well understood for two - qubit mixed states and multipartite states .",
    "it has been suggested that the quantum correlations go beyond the simple idea of entanglement .",
    "the idea of quantum discord @xcite is to quantify all types of quantum correlations including entanglement .",
    "it must be emphasized here that discord actually supplements the measure of entanglement that can be defined on the system of interest .",
    "other measures of quantum correlations that have been proposed in the literature similar to discord are quantum deficit @xcite , quantumness of correlations @xcite and quantum dissonance @xcite .",
    "+ the idea of discord @xcite uses the generalization of two - variable mutual information to quantum domain .",
    "the difference of two classically equivalent expressions when generalized to quantum setting gives the discord .",
    "it was shown that the discord reduces to von neumann entropy for a pure bipartite state .",
    "furthermore , it was found to be nonzero for some of the separable states .",
    "a number of authors have computed the discord in diverse situations @xcite . in a different approach",
    ", entropic methods have been proposed to understand the separability and correlations of a composite state @xcite . in particular ,",
    "` quantum deficit ' was introduced as a measure of quantumness over classical correlations .",
    "quantum deficit is the difference of the von neumann entropy of the system and that of the decohered state . in another approach ,",
    "horodecki _ et al _ @xcite have investigated the relation between _ local _ and _ nonlocal _ information by investigating a situation where parties sharing a multipartite state distill local information .",
    "the amount of information that is lost due to the use of classical communication channel is called _",
    "deficit_. it was shown that the upper bound for the deficit is given by the relative entropy distance to so - called pseudo classically correlated states .",
    "on the other hand the lower bound is the relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "it was argued that it was the basic reason for any entangled state to be viewed as informationally nonlocal . in another piece of work @xcite , a simple information - theoretical measure of the one - way distillable local purity was introduced .",
    "interestingly , the author showed that his proposed characterization is closely related to a previously known operational measure of classical correlations , the one - way distillable common randomness .",
    "+ recently , another measure has been introduced which is called quantumness of correlation@xcite .",
    "it has been defined for bipartite states by incorporating a specific measurement scheme .",
    "it was shown that if one uses the optimal generalized measurement on one of the subsystem it reduces the overall state in its closest separable form .",
    "it was seen that this measure gives a non zero value for all bipartite entangled states and zero for separable states .",
    "not only that , it also serves as an upper bound to the relative entropy of entanglement . in ref @xcite , authors have given a unified view of the correlations in a given quantum state by classifying it into entanglement , dissonance , and classical correlations .",
    "they used the concept of relative entropy as a distance measure of correlations .",
    "it has been claimed that their methods completely fit into multipartite systems of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "in addition they showed that dissonance attains a non zero value in the case of pure multipartite states .",
    "it has also been suggested @xcite that one single real number may not be able to capture the multifaceted nature of the correlations in the multipartite situation .",
    "one may need a vector quantity ( a set of numbers ) to characterize the correlations .",
    "in addition , the notion of maximally entangled state may depend on the task that is to be carried out .    in this paper , we generalize the notion of quantum discord from bipartite to tripartite systems .",
    "our approach is based on three - variable mutual information and its generalization to quantum setting .",
    "classically , three - variable mutual information characterizes the common information contained in three classical distributions .",
    "therefore , it appears natural to generalize it to quantum domain .",
    "we introduce three expressions of the three - variable mutual information , all of which are same classically but differ when conditional entropies are generalized to quantum level . for a tripartite system",
    ", one can make measurement on one - particle , or on more than one - particle to probe the different aspects of the quantum correlations .",
    "this would lead to multiple quantities that can characterize the correlations .",
    "we call these physical quantities `` quantum dissension . '' in the case of a tripartite state , we shall have two quantities that will characterize the correlations together .",
    "one can think of the dissension as the information contained in the multiparticle quantum state that can not be extracted by either one - particle or two - particle measurements .",
    "we note , as discussed below , in the case of one - particle measurement , the dissension can be negative because a measurement on a subsystem can enhance the correlations in the rest of the system .",
    "interestingly , in the case of two - particle measurements , the dissension is just the discord of a bipartite split of the system .",
    "we illustrate the idea of dissension with the help of specific three - qubit pure and mixed states .",
    "the pure states have genuine multipartite correlations .",
    "these states have non - zero dissension with respect to both one and two - particle measurements .",
    "interestingly , in the case of mixed ghz and w states , we have situations analogous to the two - qubit werner state .",
    "it is known that werner state has non - zero discord even for those values of classical mixing parameter for which it is is not entangled .",
    "similarly , we find that the mixed ghz and w states have non - zero dissension for all values of classical mixing parameter .",
    "therefore , dissension may be characterizing the quantumness in multiparticle system that goes beyond entanglement .",
    "we also provide an example where dissension due to two - particle measurement is zero , but it is non - zero when we make only one - particle measurement .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the notion of three - variable mutual information and then define the quantum dissensions for one - particle and two - particle measurements . in section 3 , we calculate the dissension for pure three - qubit states like ghz and w states . in section 4",
    ", we illustrate the dissension for generalized werner kind of three - qubit mixed states .",
    "we also discuss the case of a biseparable state .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we conclude and mention future directions of explorations .",
    "in classical information theory @xcite , one can quantify the relationship between two random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 by a quantity called mutual information @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the entropy of @xmath0 and the conditional entropy of @xmath0 given that @xmath1 has already occurred .",
    "mutual information actually gives the measure of the reduction in the uncertainty about one random variable because of the occurrence of the other random variable .",
    "since @xmath4 , so there is another alternative expression for the mutual information @xmath5 .",
    "classically , these two expressions of the mutual information are identical .",
    "we can generalize these expressions to quantum domain by substituting random variables @xmath6 by the density matrices @xmath7 and the shannon entropies @xmath8 by the von neumann entropies ( e.g : @xmath9 ) . with these substitutions",
    ", one can define @xmath10 in the quantum case . but to define @xmath11 , one needs to specify the conditional entropy @xmath12 . to specify this conditional entropy ,",
    "the measurement of y is defined by a set of one dimensional projectors @xmath13 @xcite . here",
    ", the subscript @xmath14 refers to the outcome of this measurement .",
    "this gives us the quantum analogue of @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the probability of obtaining the @xmath14th outcome .",
    "it is clearly evident that these two expressions for @xmath15 and @xmath20 are not identical in quantum theory .",
    "the quantum discord is the difference @xcite @xmath21 this is to be minimized over all sets of one dimensional projectors @xmath13 .",
    "it is possible to generalize the discord to multipartite systems by considering multiparticle - measurement . in this paper , we introduce the notion of quantum dissension in the context of three - qubits . in the case of three qubits , there can be two types of projective measurements .",
    "these are one - particle projective measurements and two - particle projective measurements .",
    "these measurements can be performed on different subsystems .",
    "this would lead to multiple definitions of the quantum dissension .",
    "we focus on two scenarios . in one case",
    ", we consider all possible one - particle projective measurements . in the second scenario ,",
    "we make all possible two - particle measurements .    to obtain the definition of the dissension for these two scenarios , we consider three - variable classical mutual information @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the conditional mutual information @xmath24 both @xmath15 and @xmath25 are non - negative .",
    "however , there may exist a situation , when the conditional mutual information is greater than the mutual information .",
    "it happens when knowing the variable @xmath26 enhances the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in such a case , the three - variable mutual information is negative .",
    "one well known example where it occurs is modulo 2 addition of two binary random variables .",
    "this is xor gate .",
    "suppose we add @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables and get the variable @xmath26 .",
    "let the variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 be independent , then @xmath15 is zero .",
    "however , once we know the value of @xmath26 , knowing the value of @xmath1 determines the value of @xmath0 uniquely .",
    "so the knowledge of @xmath26 , enhances the correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 is non - zero .",
    "this implies that @xmath27 is negative .",
    "this negative value captures a certain aspect of the correlations among the variables @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "we discuss an example for the quantum case later in this section .    in the case of three random variables",
    ", we can obtain many different classically equivalent expressions for @xmath29 . to achieve our goal",
    ", we obtain three different equivalent expressions . in one of the cases",
    ", the expression does not have any conditional entropy , while in the other two cases , the expression has conditional entropies with respect to one variable only or two variables only . in this way , after generalization to quantum domain , we can explore the quantum correlations of different partitions of the quantum system . using the chain rule in the definition ( 4 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath30 we can convert the above expression that involves conditional entropies to that containing only entropies and joint entropies .",
    "we obtain @xmath31 \\nonumber\\\\- [ h(x , y ) + h(x , z ) + h(y , z)]+h(x , y , z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the chain rule @xmath32 , we can define the three - variable mutual information involving two - variable conditional entropies .",
    "this gives another equivalent expression @xmath33\\nonumber\\\\- [ h(x , y)+h(x , z ) ] + h(x|y , z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these three expressions for the three - variable mutual information are classically equivalent , but not so in quantum domain .",
    "the difference of the three definitions can capture various aspects of the quantum correlations . in the next subsection",
    ", we will generalize these definitions to quantum domain . in principle , for a given quantum system the amount of information one can extract from it depends on the nature and choice of the measurement .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the discord does not changes if we use povm measurements instead of projective measurements . as dissension",
    "can be written in terms of the discord , as shown below , one may expect that the situation will remain same .",
    "therefore , in the next section we built up our definitions on the basis of projective measurement .",
    "but one can choose povm measurements also .      here , we extend the definitions of the three - variable mutual information @xmath27 and @xmath34 to the quantum domain .",
    "let us consider a three - qubit state @xmath35 , where @xmath36 refer to the first , second and the third qubit .",
    "the extension of the definition of @xmath34 is straightforward .",
    "it is obtained by replacing the random variables by the density matrices and the shannon entropies by the von neumann entropies .",
    "the extension of the expression for @xmath27 requires appropriate extension of the conditional entropies .",
    "it is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the probability of obtaining the @xmath41th outcome . here , @xmath42 is the average von neumann entropy of the qubit @xmath0 , when the projective measurement is done on the subsystem @xmath1 in the general basis @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 ) .",
    "similarly , one can write down the equivalent expressions for @xmath45 . furthermore , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "it is the average von neumann entropy of the subsystem @xmath48 , when the projective measurement is carried out on the qubit @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath49 refers to von neumann entropy of the density matrix @xmath50 . to define dissension for the single particle projective measurement , we consider the difference between @xmath27 and @xmath34",
    "this difference is given by @xmath51-h(x , y , z)- [ h(x|\\{\\pi_j^y\\})\\nonumber\\\\ + h(x|\\{\\pi_j^z\\})+h(y|\\{\\pi_j^z\\})+h(y|\\{\\pi_j^x\\})]\\nonumber \\\\   - [ h(x)+h(y)+h(z)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can minimize this over all possible one - particle measurement projectors .",
    "so mathematically the expression for the dissension is given by , @xmath52 .",
    "for single - particle projective measurements , the above expression is the most general one in the sense that it includes all possible one - particle projective measurements . as a consequence of which the dissension @xmath53 ,",
    "may reveal the maximum possible quantum correlations .",

    "furthermore , for any pure three - qubit state , @xmath83 and @xmath56 . therefore , @xmath78 .",
    "we note that the above lemma is for three - qubit case .",

    "we now group terms together and rewrite them in terms of discord @xmath88 , using @xmath89 .",
    "we notice that the fourth , sixth , ninth , tenth and eleventh terms in @xmath87 combine to give the last two terms of @xmath85 . by adding and subtracting @xmath90",
    ", we can get the remaining three terms .",
    "the relation for @xmath75 is obvious from @xmath89 and @xmath91 .",
    "classical three - variable mutual information is defined in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "its generalization to quantum domain has been discussed in this section . as discussed earlier ,",
    "when @xmath15 is smaller than @xmath25 , then @xmath27 can be negative .",
    "it happens when knowing the state @xmath26 enhances the quantum correlations between states x and y. for a simple example , consider pure three - qubit ghz state .",
    "if we trace out one qubit ( say @xmath26 ) , the reduced density matrix is a mixture of product states .",
    "if we compute mutual information with measurement in hadamard basis , then the mutual information @xmath15 is zero .",
    "however , a measurement in hadamard basis on the qubit @xmath26 reduces the subsystem of the qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 to a bell state .",
    "one can compute that @xmath92 . as a result @xmath93 . here , we see that a measurement in appropriate basis on a subsystem can enhance the correlation in the rest of the system .",
    "so the conditional mutual information can be larger than the mutual information , thus making three - variable mutual information negative .",
    "this should not be regarded as a drawback of the definition . on the contrary",
    "this may give some new insight into the true nature of quantum correlations in multipartite setting .",
    "we may also note that different measures of correlations for multipartite situations may capture different aspects of the quantumness .      in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors gave an unified view of total correlation for multi party states in terms of relative entropy .",
    "they defined entanglement ( @xmath94 ) , discord ( @xmath88 ) and dissonance ( @xmath95 ) for a given state @xmath96 as @xmath97 . here",
    "@xmath98 represents the relative entropy .",
    "the states @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the closest states to the the state @xmath96 in the sets of separable states ( @xmath101 ) and classical states ( @xmath102 ) respectively . however , our approach is based on three - variable mutual information , not on relative entropy .",
    "we are looking at the information contained in a specific state , while in the case of relative entropy , the distances from separable or classical states are used .",
    "our philosophy is that one number is not enough to characterize the quantum correlations of a multipartite state .",
    "therefore , we consider two separate types of measurements . depending on what information processing task one wishes to carry out , one set of measures may be more useful than the others .",
    "in this section we present quantum dissension for pure three - qubit states . as mentioned earlier , one can carry out both the single - particle and two - particle projective measurements in the most general basis .",
    "we illustrate the usefulness of these definitions by considering pure three - qubit ghz and w states .",

    "since the @xmath120 state is a pure state , the joint von neumannn entropy for the @xmath120 state is zero , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "then , we find out all other conditional entropic quantities required for finding out the dissension when the projective measurement is carried out on a single qubit system .",
    "the conditional entropy of any two - qubit system when the projective measurement is carried out on the third qubit is zero , i.e. , @xmath108 ( see lemma 2 ) .",
    "in addition , the conditional entropies of one qubit systems when the projective measurement is done on any one of the remaining qubits , are given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 and , @xmath124 @xmath125    on using the above equations , the expression for @xmath86 is given by @xmath126    on substituting the values of these entropic quantities , the expression @xmath86 for the w state is plotted in figure 1@xmath127 . in this case , we see from the plot that the dissension is @xmath128 .",

    "so the dissension for the w state is @xmath130 .",
    "in this section , we analyze quantum dissension for three - qubit mixed states .",

    "one would find @xmath150 .",
    "one can understand these values by rewriting this state as a biseparable state    @xmath151    where @xmath152 .",
    "for this state , @xmath75 is zero since the state is a product state in the partition @xmath153 .",
    "however , @xmath86 is due to single - particle measurement and it is non - zero .",
    "one can compute the concurrence for the qubit subsystem @xmath154 and @xmath155 and find that this subsystem is indeed entangled . therefore , as argued earlier , the correlations of a tripartite state needs to be characterized by both @xmath156 .",
    "this example also shows that one needs to compute @xmath75 for all bipartite partitions .",
    "in this paper we have introduced the notion of quantum dissension for multipartite systems .",
    "starting from three - variable mutual information definition , we obtained three equivalent expressions . when these expressions are generalized to quantum domain , then from the difference between two such expressions , we obtain two kinds of dissensions",
    ". classically , these differences are zero but in quantum domain they are not .",
    "this generalizes the notion of quantum discord to tripartite systems .",
    "we have multiple definitions of the dissension that can capture different aspects of the quantum correlations .",
    "we have illustrated the notion of quantum dissension using three - qubit pure and mixed sates .",
    "specifically , we have taken pure and mixed ghz as well as w states and calculated the dissensions .",
    "we have focused on two such definitions of dissensions .",
    "one of the definitions @xmath157 involves only one - particle measurements , while the second definition @xmath158 involves only two - particle measurements .",
    "we find that dissension can be negative .",
    "it just reflects the fact that a measurement on a subsystem can enhance the correlation of the rest of the system .",
    "this is a new feature that emerges when we deal with multiparticle systems .",
    "one can interpret the dissension as the information contained in the multiparticle quantum sate that can not be extracted by one - particle or two - particle measurements .",
    "we have also obtained the relations between @xmath86 , @xmath75 and the discord @xmath88 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath75 is just the discord for the bipartite split . however , if we generalize discord to a system of more than three qubits , then appropriate @xmath75 would not be discord ( and even can be negative ) , similar to the quantity like @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "we also note that the dissension is non - zero for all values of the classical mixing parameter for the mixed ghz and w states .",
    "the mixed ghz state that we have considered can be thought of as a generalization of the two - qubit werner state . in the case of werner state",
    ", entanglement vanishes for certain values of the mixing parameter , but discord is non - zero .",
    "we have also discussed one example where the dissension due to one - particle measurement is non - zero but that due to two - particle measurement is zero . in future",
    ", one may like to put bounds on the values of the dissension for three qubit system and higher dimensional systems .",
    "one may also like to relate the notion of dissension to the successes of various communication protocols .",
    "this may help in providing an operational meaning to dissension .",
    "following our approach , one can generalize the notion of dissension beyond three - qubit system @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to see if the multipartite dissensions play any role in giving extra power to quantum computing in the absence of the entanglement .",
