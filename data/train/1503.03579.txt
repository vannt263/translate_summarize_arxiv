    "in recent years cloud computing gained more popularity , as many prefer to host their applications in cloud due to factors such as reduced capital expenditures and operational overhead , increased it responsiveness and efficiency , greater business flexibility through an on - demand , pay - as - you - go model that scales with business needs , more choice in providers and access to latest services available in the market .",
    "there are many cloud providers in the market such as amazon ec2 @xcite , microsoft azure @xcite , gogrid @xcite , rack - space @xcite offering everything `` _ _ as a service _ _ '' .",
    "iaas ( infrastructure as a service ) is one of the cloud service type wherein consumers would take computing infrastructure on lease from cloud providers .",
    "cloud providers host , run and maintain the computational infrastructure , where they provide infrastructure to consumers as virtual machines ( vms ) .",
    "they are offered in different flavors as virtual instances ( vi ) based on configuration of resources such as cpu cycles , memory , network bandwidth and storage that are predefined by providers or customized according to consumer . to deploy their applications ,",
    "cloud consumers should load virtual machine images ( vmi ) in vi , where vmi is composition of operating system along with required software packages to run the applications .",
    "cloud consumer is responsible for maintaining the vms which are loaded with operating system and application software .",
    "they are charged based on instance type , usage , data center location and pricing plan opted ( reservation plan or on demand plan)@xcite .",
    "selecting best resources from providers and allocating resource for their needs in large cloud market is a challenging task for consumer . a third party , cloud broker eases task of service selection from cloud providers and acts as intermediate between cloud consumer and cloud provider .",
    "they play an important role in getting the information from the cloud providers about services offered , price of the service , service availability etc . , and selects the best resources according to the consumer requirements .",
    "they provide a uniform interface to access , manage , monitor and asses different cloud provider services irrespective of cloud providers technology .",
    "an evaluation against commercial clouds demonstrates that compared to single cloud deployment , multi - cloud deployment of vms improves performance and reduces cost@xcite .",
    "cloud provider is considered to have infinite resources but there would always be an upper limit based upon restrictions on available hardware , network bandwidth , etc .",
    "when there are many infrastructure offerings provided by a cloud provider , there arises a situation where the cloud provider suffers resource exhaustion .",
    "single cloud deployment model leads to several challenges where cloud service is unavailable to customer due to outages , natural disasters and attacks leaving customers with loss of access to services and data .",
    "these factors conclude that the usage of multiple clouds achieves better service , qos and reliability .",
    "resource provisioning in federated cloud is the process of finding optimal placement schemes for vms and reconfigure them according to changes in the environment .",
    "provisioning in federated cloud has several challenges due to lack of common standards and confusion prevails over which standardization methods has to be followed .",
    "various resource provisioning challenges in federated clouds and the state of the art in optimized resource provisioning methods are discussed in chapter iv .",
    "analysis over open issues are discussed in chapter v.",
    "federated cloud is a composition of two or more clouds that remain as distinct entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability @xcite .",
    "federated cloud opens the door to a range of useful scenarios that take advantage of cloud capabilities such as    * using multiple clouds for different applications to match consumer needs . * utilizing public cloud when internal resources are not enough to meet demands . *",
    "moving an application between public clouds or internal data center to meet requirements at different stages in its life cycle . * allocating different elements of an application to different environments , _",
    "application stretching_.      federated cloud brings out the following benefits over single cloud deployment .",
    "as the demand scales up , cloud bursting addresses peak demand of consumers when they ran out of computing resources ; they burst their workload to external cloud on demand basis and pay per use .",
    "cloud providers collaborate with other cloud providers to share their infrastructure with each other through contracts or framework agreements which defines control over resources , quality of service(qos ) rendered and availability , when there is demand for more resources .",
    "allows infrastructure aggregation across distributed data centers for availability of services ; minimize data transfer cost by enabling service in data centers in non - peak hours ; meet local jurisdiction and regulation on data placement within certain physical boundary .",
    "replication of service in multi - site deployment enables fault tolerance with high availability of services such as data backup , natural disaster recovery and minimal downtime when a site fails .",
    "deployment of services closer to end users increases the performance by reducing the data traffic and improves response time .",
    "dynamic placement of applications enables reduced overall deployment cost by deploying application in cloud provider , which offers service at minimal cost .",
    "collaboration within cloud providers allows providers to scale up their services without spending high on infrastructure .",
    "minimized energy consumption by server consolidation and placement of vms in energy efficient data centers which in turn minimizes cost spend on energy .",
    "federated cloud exhibits various level of coupling between cloud instances such as level of cooperation among cloud instances , remote resource control , monitoring , security and access levels , possibility of cross - site networks and migrating vms among cloud instances .",
    "vozmediano et al .",
    "@xcite discuss on federated cloud and explained more on coupling levels of cloud instances and federated cloud architectures .",
    "coupling level of cloud instances in federated cloud environment are classified into three categories and are differentiated in table i.        * coupling level & * control & * monitoring and accounting & * cross - site & * security + loosely coupled & basic operations over vms & basic virtual resource monitoring & none & single account representing the organization + partial coupled & advanced control over vms , vms location and affinity constraints & advanced virtual resource monitoring & virtual networks and storage & framework agreements + tightly coupled & placement on specific resource , same vi type & physical resource consumption & live migration and high availability & user space sharing + * * * * *      in this category , cloud instances have less inter - operation among themselves and is suitable for loosely coupled applications .",
    "monitoring is limited and they can perform only basic operations on vms such as start , stop and resume .",
    "advance features such as cross - site networks and vms migration between cloud sites and providers are not supported .",
    "this consists of different cloud partners involved in contract or framework agreement with terms and conditions describing access methods for remote resources .",
    "the framework agreement enables certain level of control over remote resources , detailed monitoring and some advanced networking features among partner clouds .",
    "this category is usually formed by clouds belonging to the same organization , and normally governed by the same cloud os type .",
    "cloud instance can have advanced control over remote resources , access to all the monitoring information of remote resources and can support features such as creation of cross- site networks , cross - site migration of vms , implementation of high - availability techniques among remote cloud instances , creation of virtual storage systems across site boundaries .",

    "basic architectures of federated cloud@xcite has been summarized in table ii .",
    "when a cloud consumer ran out of computational resources from their own internal data - center or a private cloud , they bursts workload to cloud providers ( public clouds ) to meet their demand for which they will be charged on pay per use basis .",
    "if an organization has a vmware @xcite based internal data center , cloudswitch @xcite allows the consumers to seamlessly move their workloads to public clouds such as amazon ec2@xcite , rackspace@xcite , etc .",
    "cloudswitch , utilizing their _ cloud isolation technology _ , make the ip and mac addresses of the public cloud appear as if they belong to an internal network .",
    "this allows the applications to run without any change , when moved to public clouds and the workload can be brought back into the internal data center whenever the consumer wishes .     & *",

    "cloud consumers contact cloud broker for cloud services , instead of contacting cloud providers directly .",
    "broker act as pairing service between cloud consumers and cloud providers .",
    "they negotiate contracts with cloud providers on behalf of the customer and distribute workloads across multiple cloud providers in an effort for cost effective deployment by hiding the complexity of negotiations .",
    "customers are provided with an application program interface and unified management interface for utilizing cloud services from multiple cloud providers .",
    "cloud broker architecture is loosely coupled with no advanced control over virtual resources of cloud providers .",
    "cloud is believed to have infinite resources but there would always be an upper limit based upon restrictions on available hardware , network bandwidth , etc .",
    "when there are many infrastructure offerings provided by a cloud provider , there arises a situation where cloud provider end up in resource exhaustion .",
    "under such situation a single cloud provider by itself , may not be able to fulfill additional infrastructure requirements of user in peak demands .",
    "aggregated cloud architecture contributes beneath the layers to fulfill the infrastructure requirements of customers seamlessly .",
    "cloud providers inter - operate and aggregate their resources based on contracts or framework agreements to provide their users with a larger virtual infrastructure .",
    "the customers would be aware of only the primary cloud provider . through the primary cloud provider s single virtual interface",
    ", the consumers must be able to add virtual infrastructure components and administer them as per their requirements .",
    "the actual action ( addition , migration , etc . , ) on infrastructure components in different clouds would be handled by cloud providers automatically .",
    "cloud providers have advance control over cloud instance they utilize to meet demands as specified in the framework agreements between cloud providers@xcite .",

    "multi - site cloud architecture is implemented in organizations having geographically distributed cloud infrastructures or data center .",
    "they have full control over infrastructures and exposed as a single cloud to consumers . the cloud instances are tightly coupled and can perform cross - site networking and live migration of vms .",

    "static resource provisioning based on peak demand is not cost - effective because of poor resource utilization during off - peak periods@xcite .",
    "automatic resource provisioning would lead to efficient resource utilization since , additional resources are provisioned when demand increases and de - provisioned when demand is decreases .",
    "integration of various clouds makes resource provisioning a challenging task .",
    "architecture of an application or a service has to be considered while provisioning of resources and constructing deployment plan in federated environment .",
    "loosely coupled applications can be deployed in multiple clouds ; constrains over selection of resources and deployment is minimal .",
    "application components that are less independent , having more coordination and more information flow with other components ( i.e. tightly coupled applications ) should be deployed in single cloud or same physical server .      in federated cloud architecture",

    "* develop and manage cloud services via industry standard apis .",
    "portability is just not about avoiding vendor lock - in but considering factors such as performance , availability , qos , scalability , budget and business agility .",
    "there are orchestration tools that can provide higher levels of abstraction for automating portability between clouds without relying on a common cloud api , but there are common issues on portability and interoperability among cloud providers .",

    ", sla plays an important role where , sla is a part of service contract between cloud providers and consumers that define level of service in a formal way . in federated cloud computing environment ,",
    "qos is maintained during peak demands by provisioning resources from other clouds if resource is exhausted , recovery from failures by replicating consumer application in different clouds or data center across globe or transparently migrating services to other providers with less or no downtime .",
