    "in the past ten years , modern societies have developed enormous communication and social networks .",

    "are actively being developed .",
    "indeed , the pagerank algorithm , which was initially at the basis of the development of the google search engine @xcite , is directly linked to the mathematical properties of markov chains @xcite and perron - frobenius operators @xcite . due to its mathematical foundation",
    ", this algorithm determines a ranking order of nodes that can be applied to various types of directed networks",
    ". however , the recent rapid development of www and communication networks requires the creation of new tools and algorithms to characterize the properties of these networks on a more detailed and precise level .",
    "for example , such networks contain weakly coupled or secret communities which may correspond to very small values of the pagerank and are hard to detect .",
    "it is therefore highly important to have new methods to classify and rank hige amounts of network information in a way adapted to internal network structures and characteristics .",
    "this review describes matrix tools and algorithms which facilitate classification and information retrieval from large networks recently created by human activity .",
    "the google matrix , formed by links of the network has , is typically huge ( a few tens of billions of webpages ) .",
    "thus , the analysis of its spectral properties including complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors represents a challenge for analytical and numerical methods .",
    "it is rather surprising , but the class of such matrices , which belong to the class of markov chains and perron - frobenius operators , has been essentially overlooked in physics . indeed , physical problems typically belong to the class of hermitian or unitary matrices .",
    "their properties have been actively studied in the frame of random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite and quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "the analytical and numerical tools developed in these research fields have paved the way for understanding many universal and peculiar features of such matrices in the limit of large matrix size corresponding to many - body quantum systems @xcite , quantum computers @xcite and a semiclassical limit of large quantum numbers in the regime of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the hermitian problem , the google matrices of directed networks have complex eigenvalues .",

    "we demonstrate that the analysis of the spectrum and eigenstates of a google matrix of a given network provides a detailed understanding about the information flow and ranking .",

    "currently , wikipedia , a free online encyclopaedia , stores more and more information and has become the largest database of human knowledge . in this respect",
    "it is similar to _ the library of babel _ , described by jorge luis borges @xcite .",
    "the understanding of hidden relations between various areas of knowledge on the basis of wikipedia can be improved with the help of google matrix analysis of directed hyperlink networks of wikipedia articles as described in this review .",
    "the specific tools of rmt and quantum chaos , combined with the efficient numerical methods for large matrix diagonalization like the arnoldi method @xcite , allow to analyze the spectral properties of such large matrices as the entire twitter network of 41 millions users @xcite . in 1998",

    "real networks are often characterized by power law distributions for the number of ingoing and outgoing links per node @xmath26 with typical exponents @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the www .",

    "the most recent studies of www , crawled by the common crawl foundation in 2012 @xcite for @xmath35 nodes and @xmath36 links , provide the exponents @xmath37 , @xmath38 , even if the authors stress that these distributions describe probabilities at the tails which capture only about one percent of nodes .",
    "thus , at present the existing statistical models of networks capture only in an approximate manner the real situation in large networks even if certain models are able to generate a power law decay of pagerank probability .",
    "the matrix @xmath39 of markov transitions @xcite is constructed from the adjacency matrix @xmath40 by normalizing elements of each column so that their sum is equal to unity ( @xmath41 ) and replacing columns with only zero elements ( _ dangling nodes _ ) by @xmath42 .",
    "such matrices with columns sum normalized to unity and @xmath43 belong to the class of perron - frobenius operators with a possibly degenerate unit eigenvalue @xmath44 and other eigenvalues obeying @xmath45 ( see sec .",

    "these and other mathematical results about properties of matrices of such type can be found at @xcite .    it should be pointed out that due to the asymmetry of links on directed networks such matrices have in general a complex eigenvalue spectrum and sometimes they are not even diagonalizable , i.e. there may also be generalized eigenvectors associated to non - trivial jordan blocks .",

    "each of these blocks corresponds to a column sum normalized matrix with positive elements of the same type as @xmath7 and has therefore at least one unit eigenvalue .",
    "this leads to a high degeneracy @xmath107 of the eigenvalue @xmath44 of @xmath51 , for example @xmath108 as for the case of uk universities ( see sec .",

    "this scheme , which can be efficiently implemented in a computer program , provides a subdivision over @xmath112 core space nodes ( 70 - 80% of @xmath18 for uk university networks ) and @xmath113 subspace nodes belonging to at least one of the invariant subspaces @xmath110 .",
    "this procedure generates the block triangular structure ( [ eq3_2 ] ) .",
    "one may note that since a dangling node is connected by construction to all other nodes it belongs obviously to the core space as well as all nodes which are linked ( directly or indirectly ) to a dangling node . as a consequence",
    "the invariant subspaces do not contain dangling nodes nor nodes linked to dangling nodes .    the detailed algorithm for an efficient computation of the invariant subspaces",
    "is described in @xcite . as a result the total number of all subspace nodes @xmath114 , the number of independent subspaces @xmath115 , the maximal subspace dimension @xmath116 etc . can be determined .",
    "the statistical properties for the distribution of subspace dimensions are discussed in sec .",
    "[ s8 ] for uk universities and wikipedia networks .",
    "furthermore it is possible to determine numerically with a very low effort the eigenvalues of @xmath51 associated to each subspace by separate diagonalization of the corresponding diagonal blocks in the matrix @xmath106 . for this , either exact diagonalization or , in rare cases of quite large subspaces , the arnoldi method ( see the next subsection ) can be used .",
    "after the subspace eigenvalues are determined one can apply the arnoldi method to the projected core space matrix block @xmath104 to determine the leading core space eigenvalues . in this way one obtains accurate eigenvalues because the arnoldi method does not need to compute the numerically very problematic highly degenerate unit eigenvalues of @xmath51 since the latter are already obtained from the separate and cheap subspace diagonalization .",
    "actually the alternative and naive application of the arnoldi method on the full matrix @xmath51 , without computing the subspaces first , does not provide the correct number @xmath107 of degenerate unit eigenvalues and also the obtained clustered eigenvalues , close to unity , are not very accurate .",
    "similar problems hold for the full matrix @xmath7 ( with damping factor @xmath52 ) since here only the first eigenvector , the pagerank , can be determined accurately but there are still many degenerate ( or clustered ) eigenvalues at ( or close to ) @xmath117 .",
    "since the columns sums of @xmath104 are less than unity , due to non - zero matrix elements in the block @xmath105 , the leading core space eigenvalue of @xmath104 is also below unity @xmath118 even though in certain cases the gap to unity may be very small ( see sec .",

    "the eigenvalues of the @xmath129 matrix @xmath130 are called the _ ritz eigenvalues _ and represent often very accurate approximations of the exact eigenvalues of @xmath51 , at least for a considerable fraction of the ritz eigenvalues with largest modulus .    in certain particular cases ,",
    "when @xmath124 belongs to an @xmath51 invariant subspace of small dimension @xmath131 , the element @xmath132 vanishes automatically ( if @xmath133 and assuming that numerical rounding errors are not important ) and the arnoldi iteration stops at @xmath134 and provides @xmath131 exact eigenvalues of @xmath51 for the invariant subspace .",
    "one can mention that there are more sophisticated variants of the arnoldi method @xcite where one applies ( implicit ) modifications on the initial vector @xmath124 in order to force this vector to be in some small dimensional invariant subspace which results in such a vanishing coupling matrix element .",
    "these variants known as ( implicitly ) restarted arnoldi methods allow to concentrate on certain regions on the complex plane to determine a few but very accurate eigenvalues in these regions .",

    "[ fig11_7 ] the color of symbol marks the 1st sitc digit described in figure , @xcite and table 2 in @xcite .",
    "the origin of such a difference between ecoloranking and trade volume ranking of countries is related to the main idea of mutualistic ranking in ecological systems : the nestedness ordering stresses the importance of mutualistic pollinators ( products for wtn ) which generate links and exchange between plants ( countries for wtn ) . in this way generic products , which participate in the trade between many countries , become of primary importance even if their trade volume is not at the top lines of import or export .",

    "1 code 7 ; blue ) and mineral fuels ( 3 ; black ) with a moderate contribution of chemicals ( 5 ; yellow ) and manufactured articles ( 8 ; cyan ) and a small fraction of goods classified by material ( 6 ; green ) .",
    "even if the global structure of product ranking by trade volume has certain similarities with import ecoloranking there are also important new elements . indeed , in 2008 the mutualistic significance of petroleum products ( code 332 ) , _ machindus _ ( machines for special industries code 718 ) and",
    "_ medpharm _ ( medical - pharmaceutic products code 541 ) is much higher compared to their volume ranking , while petroleum crude ( code 331 ) and office machines ( code 714 ) have smaller mutualistic significance compared to their volume ranking .",
    "the new element of ecoloranking is that it differentiates between import and export products while for trade volume they are ranked in the same way .",
    "indeed , the dominant colors for export ( fig .",
    "[ fig11_7 ] bottom panel ) correspond to food ( sitc rev . 1 code 0 ; red ) with contribution of black ( present in import ) and crude materials ( code 2 ; violet ) ; followed by cyan ( present in import ) and more pronounced presence of _ finnotclass _ ( commodities / transactions not classified code 9 ; brown ) .",
    "ecoloranking of export shows a clear decrease tendency of dominance of sitc codes 0 and 2 with time and increase of importance of codes 3,7 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the code 332 of petroleum products is vary vulnerable in volume ranking due to significant variations of petroleum prices but in ecoloranking this product keeps the stable top positions in all years showing its mutualistic structural importance for the world trade .",
    "ecoloranking of export shows also importance of fish ( code 031 ) , clothing ( code 841 ) and fruits ( code 051 ) which are placed on higher positions compared to their volume ranking . at the same time",

    "( code 732 ) , which are at top volume ranking , have relatively low ranking in export since only a few countries dominate the production of road vehicles .",

    "[ fig11_7 ] petroleum crude is at the top of trade volume ranking e.g. in 2008 ( top panel ) but it is absent in import ecoloranking ( middle panel ) and it is only on 6th position in export ecoloranking ( bottom panel ) .",
    "a similar feature is visible for years 1968 , 1978 . on a first glance",
    "this looks surprising but in fact for mutualistic ecoloranking it is important that a given product is imported from top ecolorank countries : this is definitely not the case for petroleum crude which practically is not produced inside top 10 import ecolorank countries ( the only exception is usa , which however also does not export much ) . due to that reason this product has low mutualistic significance .",
    "the mutualistic concept of product importance is at the origin of significant difference of ecoloranking of countries compared to the usual trade volume ranking ( see fig .",
    "[ fig11_5 ] , fig .  [ fig11_6 ] ) .",
    "indeed , in the latter case china and japan are at the dominant positions but their trade is concentrated in specific products which mutualistic role is relatively low . in contrast",
    "usa , germany and france keep top three ecolorank positions during almost 40 years clearly demonstrating their mutualistic power and importance for the world trade .",
    "thus our results show the universal features of ecologic ranking of complex networks with promising future applications to trade , finance and other areas .",
    "the new approach to the world trade , based on the google matrix analysis , gives a democratic type of ranking being independent of the trade amount of a given country . in this way",
    "rich and poor countries are treated on equal democratic grounds . in a certain sense",
    "pagerank probability for a given country is proportional to its rescaled import flows while cheirank is proportional to its rescaled export flows inside of the wtn .",
    "the global characteristics of the world trade are analyzed on the basis of this new type of ranking . even if all countries are treated",
    "now on equal democratic grounds still we find at the top rank the group of industrially developed countries approximately corresponding to _ g-20 _ and recover 74% of countries listed in _ g-20_. the google matrix analysis demonstrates an existence of two solid state domains of rich and poor countries which remain stable during the years of consideration .",
    "other countries correspond to a gas phase with ranking strongly fluctuating in time .",
    "we propose a simple random matrix model which well describes the statistical properties of rank distribution for the wtn @xcite .    the comparison between usual importrank  exportrank ( see e.g. @xcite ) and our pagerank ",
    "cheirank approach shows that the later highlights the trade flows in a new useful manner which is complementary to the usual analysis .",
    "the important difference between these two approaches is due to the fact that importrank ",
    "exportrank method takes into account only global amount of money exchange between a country and the rest of the world while pagerank ",
    "cheirank approach takes into account all links and money flows between all countries .",
    "the future developments should consider a matrix with all countries and all products which size becomes significantly larger ( @xmath709 ) comparing to a modest size @xmath710 considered here .",
    "however , some new problems of this multiplex network analysis should be resolved combining a democracy in countries with volume importance of products which role is not democratic .",
    "it is quite possible that such an improved analysis will generate an asymmetric ranking of products in contrast to their symmetric ranking by volume in export and import .",
    "the ecological ranking of the wtn discussed in the previous subsec . indicates preferences and asymmetry of trade in multiple products @xcite .",
    "the first steps in the google matrix analysis of multiproduct world trade network , with @xmath711 products and up to @xmath712 countries , have been done recently by @xcite confirming this asymmetry .",
    "it is established there that such multifunctional networks can be analyzed by the google matrix approach , using a certain personalized vector , so that the world countries are treated on democratic equal grounds while the contribution of products remains proportional to their trade volume .",

    "this approach can be also applied to the world network of economic activities obtained from the oecd - wto database @xcite .",

    ", the oecd - wto database contains interactions between various activity sectors of various countries that opens new possibilities for a more advanced analysis .",
    "it is also important to note that usually in economy researchers analyze time evolution of various indexes studying their correlations .",
    "the results presented above for the wtn show that in addition to time evolution there is also evolution in space of the network . like for waves in an ocean time and space are both important and we think that time and space study of trade captures important geographical factors which will play a dominant role for analysis of contamination propagation over the wtn in case of crisis .",
    "we think that the wtn data capture many essential elements which will play a rather similar role for financial flows in the interbank payment networks .",
    "we expect that the analysis of financial flows between bank units would prevent important financial crisis shaking the world in last years .",
    "unfortunately , in contrast to www and un comtrade , the banks keep hidden their financial flows . due to this secrecy of banks",

    "the enormous development of such social networks as livejournal , facebook , twitter , and vkontakte , with up to hundreds of millions of users , has demonstrated the growing influence of these networks on social and political life .",
    "the small - world scale - free structure of the social networks , combined with their rapid communication facilities , leads to a very fast information propagation over networks of electors , consumers , and citizens , making them very active on instantaneous social events .",
    "this invokes the need for new theoretical models which would allow one to understand the opinion formation process in modern society in the 21st century .",
    "the important steps in the analysis of opinion formation have been done with the development of various voter models , described in great detail in @xcite .",
    "this research field became known as sociophysics @xcite . here ,",
    "following @xcite , we analyze the opinion formation process introducing several new aspects which take into account the generic features of social networks .",
    "first , we analyze the opinion formation on real directed networks such as www of universities of cambridge and oxford ( 2006 ) , twitter ( 2009 ) and livejournal .",
    "this allows us to incorporate the correct scale - free network structure instead of unrealistic regular lattice networks , often considered in voter models .",
    "second , we assume that the opinion at a given node is formed by the opinions of its linked neighbors weighted with the pagerank probability of these network nodes .",
    "the introduction of such a weight represents the reality of social networks where network nodes are characterized by the pagerank vector which provides a natural ranking of node importance , or elector or society member importance . in a certain sense , the top nodes of pagerank correspond to a political elite of the social network whose opinion influences the opinions of other members of the society @xcite .",
    "thus the proposed pagerank opinion formation ( prof ) model takes into account the situation in which an opinion of an influential friend from high ranks of the society counts more than an opinion of a friend from a lower society level .",
    "we argue that the pagerank probability is the most natural form of ranking of society members .",
    "indeed , the efficiency of pagerank rating had been well demonstrated for various types of scale - free networks .",
    "the prof model is defined in the following way . in agreement with the standard pagerank algorithm",
    "we determine the probability @xmath194 for each node ordered by pagerank index @xmath526 ( using @xmath65 ) .",
    "in addition , a network node @xmath24 is characterized by an ising spin variable @xmath1147 which can take values @xmath1148 or @xmath1149 , coded also by red or blue color , respectively .",
    "the sign of a node @xmath24 is determined by its direct neighbors @xmath23 , which have pagerank probabilities @xmath340 . for that we compute the sum @xmath1150 over all directly linked neighbors @xmath23 of node @xmath24 : @xmath1151 where @xmath1152 and @xmath1153 denote the pagerank probability @xmath340 of a node @xmath23 pointing to node @xmath24 ( ingoing link ) and a node @xmath23 to which node @xmath24 points to ( outgoing link ) , respectively . here",

    "we can say that a large value of parameter @xmath528 corresponds to a conformist society in which an elector @xmath24 takes an opinion of other electors to which he / she points .",
    "in contrast , a large value of @xmath941 corresponds to a tenacious society in which an elector @xmath24 takes mainly the opinion of those electors who point to him / her .",
    "a standard random number generator is used to create an initial random distribution of spins @xmath1147 on a given network .",

    "we study the time evolution @xmath1171 for a large number @xmath887 of initial random realizations of colors following it up to the convergence time for each realization .",

    "for the larger value @xmath1177 we have @xmath1178 , @xmath1179 @xcite .     to find a final red fraction @xmath1162 , shown in @xmath772axis , in dependence on an initial red fraction @xmath1163 , shown in @xmath769 axis ; data are shown inside the unit square @xmath1164 .",

    "the probability @xmath1165 is proportional to color changing from zero ( blue / black ) to unity ( red / gray ) .",
    "after @xcite .",
    "[ fig14_10],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    -0.3 cm    our interpretation of these results is the following . for small values of @xmath1182 the opinion of a given society member",
    "is determined mainly by the pagerank of neighbors to whom he / she points ( outgoing links ) .",
    "the pagerank probability @xmath76 of nodes to which many nodes point is usually high , since @xmath76 is proportional to the number of ingoing links .",
    "thus at @xmath1182 the society is composed of members who form their opinion by listening to an elite opinion . in such a society its elite with one color opinion can impose this opinion on a large fraction of the society .",
    "indeed , the direct analysis of the case , where the top @xmath1183 nodes of pagerank index have the same red color , shows that this 1% of the society elite can impose its opinion to about 50% of the whole society at small @xmath941 values ( conformist society ) while at large @xmath941 values ( tenacious society ) this fraction drops significantly ( see fig.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that in fig .",
    "[ fig14_9 ] we start with a randomly distributed opinion , since the opinion of the elite has two fractions of two colors this creates a bistable situation when the two fractions of society follow the opinions of this divided elite , which makes the situation bistable on a larger interval of @xmath1163 compared to the case of a tenacious society at @xmath1184 . when we replace in ( [ eqopinion1 ] ) @xmath76 by @xmath551",
    "then the bistability disappears .",
    "however , the detailed understanding of the opinion formation on directed networks still waits it development .",
    "indeed , the results of prof model for the livejournal and twitted networks show that the bistability in these networks practically disappears .",
    "also e.g. for the twitter network studied in sec .",
    "[ s10.1 ] , the elite of @xmath1185 ( about 0.1% of the whole society ) can impose its opinion to 80% of the society at small @xmath1186 and to about 30% for @xmath1187 @xcite .",
    "it is possible that a large number of links between top pagerank nodes in twitter creates a stronger tendency to a totalitarian opinion formation comparing to the case of university networks . at the same time",
    "the studies of opinion formation with the prof model on the ulam networks @xcite , which have not very large number of links , show practically no bistability in opinion formation .",
    "it is expected that a small number of loops is at the origin of such a difference in respect to university networks .",
    "finally we discuss a more generic version of opinion formation called the prof - sznajd model @xcite .",
    "indeed , we see that in the prof model on university network opinions of small groups of red nodes with @xmath1188 are completely suppressed that seems to be not very realistic .",
    "in fact , the sznajd model @xcite features the idea of resistant groups of a society and thus incorporates a well - known trade union principle `` united we stand , divided we fall '' .",
    "usually the sznajd model is studied on regular lattices .",
    "its generalization for directed networks is done on the basis of the notion of group of nodes @xmath1053 at each discrete time step @xmath1189 .",
    "the evolution of group is defined by the following rules :    @xmath566 we pick in the network by random a node @xmath24 and consider the polarization of @xmath1190 highest pagerank nodes pointing to it ;    @xmath558 if node @xmath24 and all other @xmath1190 nodes have the same color ( same polarization ) , then these @xmath1053 nodes form a group whose effective pagerank value is the sum of all the member values @xmath1191 ;    @xmath916 consider all the nodes pointing to any member of the group and check all these nodes @xmath1192 directly linked to the group : if an individual node pagerank value @xmath1193 is less than the defined above @xmath1194 , the node joins the group by taking the same color ( polarization ) as the group nodes and increase @xmath1194 by the value of @xmath1193 ; if it is not the case , a node is left unchanged .",
    "the above time step is repeated many times during time @xmath1189 , counting the number of steps and choosing a random node @xmath24 on each next step .",
    "the time evolution of this prof - sznajd model converges to a steady state approximately after @xmath1195 steps .",
    "this is compatible with the results obtained for the prof model .",
    "however , the statistical fluctuations in the steady - state regime are present keeping the color distribution only on average .",
    "the dependence of the final fraction of red nodes @xmath1162 on its initial value @xmath1163 is shown by the density plot of probability @xmath1165 in fig .",
    "[ fig14_10 ] for the university networks .",
    "the probability @xmath1165 is obtained from many initial random realizations in a similar way to the case of fig .  [ fig14_9 ] .",
    "we see that there is a significant difference compared to the prof model : now even at small values of @xmath1163 we find small but finite values of @xmath1162 , while in the prof model the red color disappears at @xmath1172 .",
    "this feature is related to the essence of the sznajd model : here , even small groups can resist against the totalitarian opinion .",
    "other features of fig .",
    "[ fig14_10 ] are similar to those found for the prof model : we again observe bistability of opinion formation .",
    "the number of nodes @xmath1053 , which form the group , does not significantly affect the distribution @xmath1165 ( for studied @xmath1196 ) .",
    "the above studies of opinion formation models on scale - free networks show that the society elite , corresponding to the top pagerank nodes , can impose its opinion on a significant fraction of the society .",
    "however , for a homogeneous distribution of two opinions , there exists a bistability range of opinions which depends on a conformist parameter characterizing the opinion formation .",
    "the proposed prof - sznajd model shows that totalitarian opinions can be escaped from by small subcommunities .",
    "the enormous development of social networks in the last few years definitely shows that the analysis of opinion formation on such networks requires further investigations .",
    "above we considered many examples of real directed networks where the google matrix analysis finds useful applications .",
    "the examples belong to various sciences varying from www , social and wikipedia networks , software architecture to world trade , games , dna sequences and ulam networks .",
    "it is clear that the concept of markov chains and google matrix represents now the mathematical foundation of directed network analysis .    for hermitian and unitary matrices",
    "there are now many universal concepts , developed in theoretical physics , so that the main properties of such matrices are well understood .",
    "indeed , such characteristics as level spacing statistics , localization and delocalization properties of eigenstates , anderson transition @xcite , quantum chaos features can be now well handled by various theoretical methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a number of generic models has been developed in this area allowing to understand the main effects via numerical simulations and analytical tools .",
    "in contrast to the above case of hermitian or unitary matrices , the studies of matrices of markov chains of directed networks are now only at their initial stage . in this review , on examples of real networks we illustrated certain typical properties of such matrices . among them",
    "there is the fractal weyl law , which has certain traces in the field of quantum chaotic scattering , but the main part of features are new ones .",
    "in fact , the spectral properties of markov chains had not been investigated on a large scale .",
    "we try here to provide an introduction to the properties of such matrices which contain all information about large scale directed networks .",
    "the google matrix is like _ the library of babel _ @xcite , which contains everything .",
    "unfortunately , we are still not able to find generic markov matrix models which reproduce the main features of the real networks . among them",
    "there is the possible spectral degeneracy at damping @xmath72 , absence of spectral gap , algebraic decay of eigenvectors . due to absence of such generic models",
    "it is still difficult to capture the main properties of real directed networks and to understand or predict their variations with a change of network parameters . at the moment",
    "the main part of real networks have an algebraic decay of pagerank vector with an exponent @xmath1197 .",
    "however , certain examples of ulam networks ( see figs .  [ fig6_6 ] ,  [ fig6_7 ] ) show that a delocalization of pagerank probability over the whole network can take place .",
    "such a phenomenon looks to be similar to the anderson transition for electrons in disordered solids .",
    "it is clear that if an anderson delocalization of pagerank would took place , as a result of further developments of the www , the search engines based on the pagerank would loose their efficiency since the ranking would become very sensitive to various fluctuations . in a sense",
    "the whole world would go blind the day such a delocalization takes place . due to",
    "that a better understanding of the fundamental properties of google matrices and their dependencies on various system parameters have a high practical significance .",

    "the google matrix still keeps its secrets to be discovered by researchers from various fields of science .",
