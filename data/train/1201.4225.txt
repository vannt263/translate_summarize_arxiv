    "in the 1960 s , richard j.  thompson introduced three infinite groups @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "each of these groups consists of piecewise - linear homeomorphisms , with @xmath0 acting on the unit interval , @xmath1 acting on the unit circle , and @xmath2 acting on the cantor set .",
    "because of their simple definitions and unique array of properties , these groups have attracted significant attention from geometric group theorists .",
    "one of the puzzling aspects of thompson s groups is the fact that there are precisely three of them .",
    "most groups of interest in geometric group theory arise in large infinite families , but the thompson groups do not fit into any obvious larger framework . for this reason , there have been many attempts to generalize these groups , including higman s groups  @xmath3  @xcite , brown s groups @xmath4 and  @xmath5  @xcite , the piecewise - linear groups of bieri and strebel  @xcite and stein  @xcite , the braided version of  @xmath2 studied independently by brin  @xcite and dehornoy  @xcite , the two - dimensional version of @xmath2 described by brin  @xcite , and the diagram groups of guba and sapir  @xcite .",
    "the definitions of the three thompson groups depend heavily on the self - similar structure of the spaces on which these groups act .",
    "for example , each half of the unit interval is similar to the whole interval , as is each quarter or eighth . for this reason ,",
    "it is natural to ask whether there are thompson - like groups associated with other self - similar structures , such as fractals .    in this paper",
    "we define a thompson - like group @xmath6 that acts by homeomorphisms on the basilica julia set ( the julia set for the quadratic polynomial @xmath7 ) .",
    "each element of this group can be described as a piecewise - linear homeomorphism of the unit circle that preserves the invariant lamination for the basilica , as defined in  @xcite .",
    "this group is finitely generated , and it possesses an analogue of tree - pair diagrams which we refer to as `` arc pair diagrams '' .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have restricted our investigation to the basilica .",
    "we expect that most of our results generalize easily to other julia sets with similar structure to the basilica , such as the douady rabbit .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how to best generalize the definition of @xmath6 to quadratic julia sets whose laminations have a more complicated structure .",
    "we would ultimately like to associate a thompson group to every quadratic julia set , in such a way that @xmath1  is associated with the circle ( the julia set for  @xmath8 ) , @xmath0  is associated with the line segment ( the julia set for @xmath9 ) , and @xmath2 is associated with disconnected quadratic julia sets ( which are always homeomorphic to the cantor set ) .    finally , we should point out that our group @xmath6 is different from the `` basilica group '' introduced by r.  grigorchuk and a.  uk @xcite .",
    "the latter is the same as the iterated monodromy group @xcite of the basilica polynomial , and does not act on the julia set itself .",
    "it is not clear what , if any , relationship exists between the basilica group and our group @xmath6 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we briefly review the definition and properties of thompson s group  @xmath1 . in section",
    "3 we give the necessary background on the basilica julia set and its corresponding invariant lamination . in section  4",
    "we define the elements of the group @xmath6 using arc pair diagrams . in section  5",
    "we prove that @xmath6 forms a group , and we characterize the elements of @xmath6 among all piecewise - linear homeomorphisms .",
    "section  6 describes an isomorphism between a subgroup of @xmath6 and thompson s group  @xmath1 . in section  7",
    "we show that @xmath6 is finitely generated , and in section  8 we prove that @xmath6 is virtually simple .",
    "in this section we briefly review the necessary background on thompson s group  @xmath1 . see @xcite for a more thorough introduction .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the unit circle , which we identify with @xmath11 .",
    "suppose we cut this circle in half along the points @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as shown in the following figure :        we then cut each of the resulting intervals in half :        and then cut some of the new intervals in half :        continuing in this way , we obtain a subdivision of the circle into finitely many intervals . any subdivision obtained in this fashion ( by repeatedly cutting in half ) is called a * dyadic subdivision*.    the intervals of a dyadic subdivision are all of the form @xmath14\\ ] ] for some @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "intervals of this form are called * standard dyadic intervals * , and any endpoint of a standard dyadic interval is called a * dyadic point * on the circle .",
    "it is easy to see that any subdivision of the circle into standard dyadic intervals is in fact a dyadic subdivision .",
    "a * dyadic rearrangement * of the circle is any orientation - preserving piecewise - linear homeomorphism @xmath17 that maps linearly between the intervals of two dyadic subdivisions .",
    "such a homeomorphism can be specified by a pair of dyadic subdivisions , together with a bijection between the intervals that preserves the counterclockwise order .",
    "three such rearrangements are shown in figure  [ fig : tgenerators ] .",
    "the following proposition characterizes dyadic rearrangements :    let @xmath17 be a piecewise - linear homeomorphism . then @xmath18 is a dyadic rearrangement if and only if it satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the derivative of each linear segment of @xmath18 has the form @xmath19 for some @xmath20 .",
    "each breakpoint of @xmath18 maps a dyadic point in the domain to a dyadic point in the range .",
    "it is easy to see from this proposition that the dyadic rearrangements of the circle form a group under composition .",
    "this group is known as * thompson s group  @xmath21*. the following theorem summarizes some of the basic properties of this group , most of which are proven in @xcite :    [ thm : tfacts ]    1 .",
    "@xmath1 is finitely generated .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 is generated by the three dyadic rearrangements shown in figure  [ fig : tgenerators ] .",
    "@xmath1 is finitely presented , and indeed has type @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is simple .",
    "@xmath1 acts transitively on the dyadic points of the circle .",
    "the stabilizer under @xmath1 of any dyadic point is isomorphic to thompson s group  @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the definition of the basilica julia set and its relation to the basilica lamination .",
    "see  @xcite for further information .",
    "let @xmath23 be the polynomial function @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 , the * orbit * of @xmath26 under @xmath27 is the sequence @xmath28 the * filled julia set * for @xmath27 is the subset of the complex plane consisting of all points whose orbits remain bounded under  @xmath27 .",
    "this set is shown in figure  [ basilicapictures]a .",
    "the * julia set * for @xmath27 is the topological boundary of the filled julia set , as shown in figure  [ basilicapictures]b .",
    "this julia set is known as the * basilica * , and will be denoted by the letter  @xmath29 .",
    "the complement of the basilica consists of an exterior region , together with infinitely many interior regions , which we refer to as * components * of the basilica .",
    "each of these components is a topological disk , and two of these components are said to be * adjacent * if they have a boundary point in common . among the components ,",
    "the most important is the large * central component * , which contains the origin of the complex plane .     from the exterior of the basilica to the complement of the closed unit disk .",
    "]    the exterior region @xmath30 for the basilica is an open annulus . by the riemann mapping theorem ,",
    "this region is conformally equivalent to the complement @xmath31 of the closed unit disk .",
    "indeed , there exists a unique conformal homeomorphism @xmath32 making the following diagram commute : @xmath33^p\\ar[d]_{\\phi } & e\\ar[d]^{\\phi } \\\\      { \\mathbb{c}}\\backslash d^2 \\ar[r]_{z^2 } & { \\mathbb{c}}\\backslash d^2      } \\ ] ] the homeomorphism @xmath34 is known as the * bttcher map * for the basilica .",
    "a sketch of this map is shown in figure  [ riemannmap ] .",
    "the preimages of radial lines under the bttcher map are known as * external rays*. several of these are shown in figure  [ externalrays ] , with each ray labeled by the corresponding angle .",
    "( by convention , we label angles with real numbers from @xmath12 to @xmath35 . )",
    "each external ray lands at a point on the basilica , which defines a continuous surjection @xmath36 from the unit circle @xmath10 to the basilica  @xmath29 .",
    "this map fits into a commutative diagram : @xmath37^{z^2}\\ar[d]_{\\psi } & s^1\\ar[d]^{\\psi } \\\\",
    "b \\ar[r]_p & b      } \\ ] ] the map @xmath36 is not one - to - one .",
    "for example , the external rays for @xmath38 and @xmath39 end at the same point of the basilica ( see figure  [ externalrays ] ) , and therefore @xmath40 .    since the circle is compact , the map @xmath36 is a quotient map , and therefore the basilica is a quotient of the circle .",
    "the corresponding equivalence relation can be described using an * invariant lamination * ( see figure  [ arcdiagram ] ) , which we refer to as the * basilica lamination*. this lamination consists of the closed unit disk  @xmath41 , together with a hyperbolic arc ( or _ leaf _ ) connecting each pair of points on the boundary circle that are identified in the basilica .",
    "for example , there is an arc from @xmath38 to @xmath39 in the basilica lamination because the external rays for these angles land at the same point .",
    "more generally , there is an arc in the lamination between the points @xmath42 for all @xmath15 and @xmath43",
    ".        the complementary components of the basilica lamination are known as * gaps*. each of these corresponds to a component of the basilica .",
    "indeed , the filled julia set can be described as the quotient of the closed unit disk obtained by contracting each arc of the lamination to a single point .",
    "note then that two gaps correspond to adjacent components if and only if the closures of the gaps intersect along an arc of the lamination .",
    "consider the arcs @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the unit disk :        these arcs divide the unit circle into four subintervals , namely @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 $ ] , and @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "each of these intervals supports its own * primary arc * , which subdivides the interval with ratios @xmath50 .",
    "we add these arcs to our diagram :        together , these six arcs divide the circle into twelve subintervals .",
    "again , each of these intervals supports a primary arc , and we add some of these arcs to our diagram :        continuing in this way , we obtain a finite collection of arcs , which we refer to as an * arc diagram*. by definition , every arc diagram must include at least the two arcs @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "any arc diagram divides the unit circle into finitely many intervals , each of which has the form @xmath51",
    "\\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad \\left[\\frac{3k-1}{3\\cdot 2^{n+1}},\\,\\frac{3k+1}{3\\cdot 2^{n+1}}\\right]\\ ] ] for some @xmath52 .",
    "we refer to intervals of this form as * standard intervals*. it is easy to see that any subdivision of the unit circle into standard intervals can be obtained from some arc diagram .",
    "we can think of an arc diagram as a @xmath53-complex , with the arcs and intervals as edges and the regions as faces .",
    "we say that two arc diagrams are * isomorphic * if there exists an orientation - preserving isomorphism between the corresponding complexes .",
    "given an isomorphism @xmath54 between two arc diagrams , we can define a piecewise - linear homeomorphism @xmath17 by sending each interval of @xmath55 linearly to the corresponding interval of @xmath56 .",
    "note that such a homeomorphism necessarily preserves the basilica lamination , and therefore acts as a self - homeomorphism of the julia set .",
    "we will refer to such a homeomorphism as a * dyadic rearrangement * of the basilica . in section  5",
    "we will prove that the set of dyadic rearrangements of the basilica forms a group .",
    "figure  [ isomorphic ] shows an isomorphism between two arc diagrams , which in turn defines a dyadic rearrangement of the basilica .",
    "we will refer to a picture of this kind as an * arc pair diagram*. note that we have marked a corresponding pair of points in the domain and range to specify the isomorphism .    in section  7",
    ", we will prove that the group of dyadic rearrangements of the basilica is generated by four elements @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",

    "the following table lists the breakpoints for the corresponding piecewise - linear homeomorphisms : @xmath61 \\hline \\end{tabular}\\ ] ] the homeomorphism @xmath60 is corresponds to the linear function @xmath62 , which has no breakpoints .",
    "figure [ actiononbasilica ] shows the actions of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 on the basilica .",
    "geometrically , @xmath57 fixes the right and left endpoints of the basilica , and slides each component along the real axis one step to the right . both @xmath58 and @xmath59 permute the components adjacent to central component .",
    "note that @xmath59 acts as the identity on the part of the basilica not shown in figure  [ actiononbasilica ] .",
    "lastly , @xmath60 acts as a @xmath63 rotation of the basilica around the origin .",
    "let @xmath6 be the set of all dyadic rearrangements of the basilica . in this section ,",
    "we characterize the elements of @xmath6 among all piecewise - linear homeomorphisms of the circle . using this characterization",
    ", we will prove that @xmath6 forms a group under composition .",
    "as we have seen , every element of @xmath6 can be defined using an arc pair diagram . however , the arc pair diagram for a given dyadic rearrangement is not necessarily unique .",
    "an * expansion * of an arc pair diagram is obtained by attaching primary arcs to a corresponding pair of intervals in the domain and range ( see figure  [ reduceexpand ] ) . the inverse of an expansion is called a * reduction*. an arc pair diagram is * reduced * if it is not subject to any reductions .",
    "expansions and reductions do not change the underlying piecewise - linear homeomorphism  they simply correspond to adding or removing unnecessary subdivisions of the domain and range intervals .",
    "every element of @xmath6 has a unique reduced arc pair diagram .",
    "let @xmath64 .",
    "given a standard interval @xmath65 , we say that @xmath65 is _ regular _ if @xmath18 is linear on  @xmath65 , and the image @xmath66 is also a standard interval .",
    "the domain intervals of any arc pair diagram for @xmath18 must be regular , and any subdivision of the domain into regular intervals determines an arc pair diagram . in particular ,",
    "an arc pair diagram for @xmath18 is reduced if and only if each of the regular intervals in its domain is maximal under inclusion .",
    "now , for any pair of standard intervals , either one is contained in the other or the two intervals have disjoint interiors .",
    "it follows that any two maximal regular intervals have disjoint interiors , so there can be only one subdivision of the circle into maximal regular intervals .",
    "given the reduced arc pair diagrams for two dyadic rearrangements @xmath67 , there is a simple algorithm to compute an arc pair diagram for the composition @xmath68 , as illustrated in the following example :    suppose we wish to compute an arc pair diagram for the composition @xmath69 , starting with the arc pair diagrams for @xmath57 and @xmath58 shown in figure  [ arcpairgens ] .",
    "the first step is to expand the arc pair diagram for @xmath57 until the range diagram for @xmath57 contains the domain diagram for  @xmath58 :        next , we expand the arc pair diagram for @xmath58 so that the domain diagram for @xmath58 is the same as the range diagram for @xmath57 :         finally , we construct an arc pair diagram for @xmath69 using the domain diagram for @xmath57 and the range diagram for  @xmath58 :        the isomorphism between these two arc diagrams is obtained by composing the isomorphisms from the expanded arc pair diagrams for @xmath57 and  @xmath58 .",
    "it is possible to use the above algorithm to prove that @xmath6 is a group .",
    "however , we will take a different approach :    [ grouptb]let @xmath18 be a piecewise - linear homeomorphism of the circle",
    ". then @xmath18 induces a dyadic rearrangement of the basilica if and only if it satisfies the following requirements :    1 .",
    "the basilica lamination is invariant under  @xmath18 .",
    "every breakpoint of @xmath18 is the endpoint of an arc in the lamination .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 forms a group under composition .",
    "the forward direction follows from the definition of a dyadic rearrangement of the basilica . for the converse ,",
    "recall that the endpoints of the arcs of the basilica lamination all have the form @xmath70 where @xmath15 and @xmath71 .",
    "each linear segment of @xmath18 must preserve this set of points , and must therefore have the form @xmath72 for some @xmath73 .",
    "now , let @xmath74 be the maximum value of @xmath75 that appears in formulas ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for the breakpoints and linear segments of  @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath55 be any dyadic subdivision of the unit circle into standard intervals of length less than  @xmath76",
    ". then @xmath18 must be linear on each interval of @xmath55 , and each of these intervals maps to a standard interval under  @xmath18 .",
    "the images of the intervals of @xmath55 form a dyadic subdivision @xmath56 of the range , and @xmath18 maps linearly between the intervals of @xmath55 and  @xmath56 . moreover , since @xmath18 preserves the arcs of the basilica lamination , @xmath18  must induce an isomorphism between the arc diagrams for @xmath55 and  @xmath56 , and therefore @xmath18 is a dyadic rearrangement .    as discussed in the proof of this theorem , each linear segment of an element of  @xmath6",
    "has the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is a dyadic rational .",
    "however , the breakpoints of such an element are not dyadic rationals , so elements of @xmath6 do not act in the circle in the same way as elements of thompson s group  @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , the group @xmath6 is isomorphic to a subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , consider the group @xmath80 of all piecewise - linear homeomorphisms of the circle satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the derivative of each linear segment has the form @xmath19 for some @xmath20 .",
    "the coordinates of each breakpoint have the form @xmath81 for some @xmath82 .",
    "then @xmath80 is isomorphic to thompson s group  @xmath1 , since it it conjugate to @xmath1 in the group of all piecewise - linear homeomorphisms of the circle .",
    "each element of @xmath6 acts on the circle as an element of @xmath80 , and therefore @xmath6 is isomorphic to a subgroup of thompson s group  @xmath1 .",
    "consider the central component @xmath83 of the basilica julia set .",
    "this component is a quotient of the * central gap * in the basilica lamination , i.e.  the gap containing the center point of the disk . in particular , @xmath83 is obtained from the central gap by collapsing each of the infinitely many * central arcs * that surround this gap .",
    "we can label these central arcs using the dyadic rationals , as shown in figure  [ fig : centralcomponentpictures]a .",
    "each central arc corresponds to a single point in the boundary @xmath84 of  @xmath83 the central component .",
    "these points are dense in @xmath84 , as shown in figure  [ fig : centralcomponentpictures]b .",
    "therefore , the labeling of the central arcs by dyadics induces a well - defined homeomorphism from @xmath84 to the unit circle .",
    "in particular , we obtain a canonical action of thompson s group @xmath1 on  @xmath84    it possible to use the riemann mapping theorem to define the homeomorphism @xmath85 directly , without reference to the invariant lamination .",
    "in particular , consider the riemann map from @xmath83 to the unit disk that sends @xmath12 to @xmath12 with derivative @xmath35 , as shown in figure  [ fig : centerbulbriemann ] .",
    "this map extends to the boundary , and the resulting homeomorphism from @xmath84 to the circle is the same as the one defined above .",
    "as we shall see , the action of thompson s group @xmath1 on @xmath84 is closely related to the action of @xmath6 on the basilica . in particular , consider the following two subgroups of  @xmath6 :    1 .",
    "the * stabilizer * of @xmath83 , denoted @xmath86 , is the group of all elements of @xmath6 that map the central component @xmath83 to itself .",
    "the * rigid stabilizer * of @xmath83 , denoted @xmath87 , is the group of all elements of @xmath6 that have an arc pair diagram consisting solely of central arcs .        every element of the stabilizer maps @xmath83 to itself , and therefore the group @xmath86 acts on @xmath84 by homeomorphisms .",
    "the rigid stabilizer @xmath87 is a subgroup of @xmath86 .",
    "though we have defined it using arc pair diagrams , @xmath87 can also be characterized as the group all elements of @xmath86 that extend conformally to the interiors of the non - central components of  @xmath29 .",
    "it is `` rigid '' in the sense that an element of @xmath87 is determined entirely by its action on  @xmath84 .",
    "the following theorem describes the action of these groups on the boundary of the central component :    [ thm : mapstot ] each element of @xmath86 acts on @xmath84 as an element of thompson s group  @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath87 acts on @xmath84 as an isomorphic copy of @xmath1 .",
    "consider first an element @xmath88 .",
    "for example , @xmath18 could be the following element :        note that @xmath18 must have the same number of central arcs in its domain and range diagrams .",
    "these arcs correspond precisely to the cut points for two dyadic subdivisions of the circle :        this correspondence clearly defines an isomorphism @xmath89 .",
    "next , observe that the action of an element @xmath88 on the central arcs on the basilica lamination is precisely the same as the action of @xmath90 on the dyadic points of the circle .",
    "since the images of the central arcs are dense in @xmath84 , it follows that @xmath18 acts on @xmath84 in exactly the same way as  @xmath90 .",
    "finally , observe that if @xmath91 is any element of @xmath86 , then @xmath91 acts on  @xmath84 in exactly the same way as some element @xmath92 .",
    "specifically , an arc pair diagram for @xmath18 can be obtained by removing all of the non - central arcs from an arc pair diagram for @xmath91 .",
    "for example , the following element of @xmath86 acts on @xmath84 in precisely the same way as the element @xmath92 shown above :        [ cor : gensfort]the group @xmath87 is generated by the elements @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 defined in example  [ ex : generators ]    these three elements act on @xmath84 in the same way as the three generators for thompson s group  @xmath1 shown in figure  [ fig : tgenerators ] .",
    "theorem  [ thm : mapstot ] shows that @xmath6 contains an isomorphic copy of thompson s group  @xmath1 .",
    "this has a few basic consequences :    1 .",
    "@xmath6 contains a non - abelian free group of rank two .",
    "2 .   @xmath6 contains a free abelian group of infinite rank .",
    "it follows from ( 1 ) that @xmath6 has exponential growth , and is not amenable .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ thm : mapstot ] that @xmath86 splits as a semidirect product : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the group of all elements of @xmath86 that restrict to the identity on  @xmath84 .",
    "though we shall not prove it here , @xmath86 is actually isomorphic to a direct limit of iterated wreath products : @xmath95 where @xmath1 acts on the dyadic points of the circle , and @xmath0 denotes thompson s group @xmath0 acting on the dyadic points in the interval @xmath96 .",
    "note that each of the wreath products above is a restricted wreath product , i.e.  a semidirect product whose first component is an infinite direct _ sum _ of groups .",
    "in this section we prove the following theorem :    [ thm : generators ] the group @xmath6 is generated by the elements @xmath97 defined in example  [ ex : generators ] .",
    "we will need the following lemma :    [ lemma : transitiveonregions ] the group @xmath98 acts transitively on the gaps of the basilica lamination .",
    "define the _ depth _ of each gap in the basilica lamination to be the number of arcs separating it from the central gap .",
    "thus the central gap has depth zero , adjacent gaps have depth one , and so forth .",
    "let @xmath99 be any gap of depth @xmath100 .",
    "we will show that @xmath99 can be mapped to the central gap using an element of @xmath98 .",
    "we proceed by induction on @xmath100 .    if @xmath101 then @xmath99 is already the central gap and we are done .",
    "otherwise , @xmath99 is connected to the central gap @xmath102 through a path @xmath103 of pairwise adjacent gaps .",
    "consider the gap @xmath104 , which borders the central gap along a central arc  @xmath105 .",
    "now , recall from section  6 that the group @xmath106 acts on the central arcs in the same way that thompson s group  @xmath1 acts on the dyadic points of the unit circle",
    ". in particular , the group @xmath106 acts transitively on the central arcs , so there exists an element @xmath107 for which @xmath108 is the arc @xmath44",
    ". then @xmath109 must be the gap directly to the left of the central gap , so @xmath110 is the central gap .",
    "then @xmath111 is a path of pairwise adjacent gaps , where @xmath110 is the central gap , and therefore @xmath112 has depth @xmath113 . by our induction hypothesis",
    ", it follows that @xmath112 can be mapped to the central gap , and therefore @xmath99 can as well .",
    "let @xmath114 . by the lemma",
    ", we may assume that @xmath18 maps the central gap to itself , i.e.  that @xmath115 .",
    "we must show that @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath100 be the total number of arcs in the reduced arc pair diagram for  @xmath18 .",
    "we proceed by induction on  @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath117 , since the arcs @xmath44 and @xmath45 must appear in both the domain and range diagrams .",
    "the base case is @xmath118 , for which @xmath18 must be either the identity or the element @xmath60 , both of which lie in @xmath98 .",

    "@xmath157 is generated by the six elements in the statement of the theorem together with the element @xmath158 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath159 , which proves that @xmath157 is generated by the six given elements .",
    "we must show that each of these elements lies in the commutator subgroup .    from section  6 , we know that @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 generate a subgroup of  @xmath6 isomorphic to thompson s group  @xmath1 .",

    "in particular , we use epstein s double commutator trick , together with an argument that @xmath6 is generated by elements of small support .",
    "let @xmath18 be a non - trivial element of @xmath164 .",
    "since the dyadic points are dense on the unit circle , there must exist some dyadic rational @xmath166 that is not fixed by  @xmath18 .",

    "now , since each arc of the basilica lamination borders gaps of two different colors , the group @xmath147 $ ] acts transitively on these arcs .",
    "in particular , there exists an element @xmath176 $ ] that maps the arc joining the endpoints of @xmath65 to @xmath44",

    "the elements of @xmath87 with support on @xmath178 $ ] correspond to the stabilizer of  @xmath13 in  @xmath1 , which is a copy of thompson s group  @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath0 is not abelian , there exists at least one pair of elements @xmath180 with support in @xmath178 $ ] for which @xmath175 $ ] is nontrivial .",
