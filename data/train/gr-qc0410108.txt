    "the stability of a black hole has been discussed for many years . the pioneering work on this problem was carried by regge and wheeler@xcite , who studied the linear perturbation of schwarzschild black hole . vishveshwara@xcite and chandrasekhar@xcite furthered this work by bringing forward quasinormal modes(qnms ) .",
    "being its importance both in the analysis of the stability of the black holes and in the search for black holes and its gravitational radiation , the qnms of black holes in the framework of general relativity have been studied widely .",
    "+ qnms of black holes are defined as proper solutions of the perturbation equations belonging to certain complex characteristic frequencies which satisfy the boundary conditions appropriate for purely ingoing waves at the event horizon and purely outgoing waves at infinity@xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the evolution of field perturbation on a black hole consists roughly of three stages@xcite .",
    "the first one is an initial wave dependent on the initial form of the original field perturbation .",
    "the second one involves the damped oscillations called qnms , which frequencies and damping times are entirely fixed by the structure of the background spacetime and are independent of the initial perturbation . the last stage is a power - law tail behavior of the waves at very late time which is caused by backscattering of the gravitational field .",
    "+ qnms were firstly used to study the stability of a black hole",
    ". then people used it to study the properties of black holes for the definite relations between the parameters of the black hole and its qnms .",
    "latest studies in asymptotically flat space have acquired a further attention because of the possible relation between the classical vibrations of black holes and various quantum aspects , which was proposed by relating the real part of the quasinormal frequencies to the barbero - immirzi parameter , a factor introduced by hand in order that loop quantum gravity reproduces correctly entropy of the black hole@xcite . moreover",
    ", qnms also relate to superstring theory@xcite .",
    "this is known as the ads / cft correspondence , which argues that string theory in anti - de sitter(ads ) space is equivalent to conformal field theory(cft)in one less dimension .",
    "+ we know that the schwarzschild spacetime can describe an uncharged black hole in string theory very well ( except in the region near the horizon ) when the mass of the black hole is larger than the plank mass . however , this is not the case for a charged black hole in string theory .",
    "gibbons and maeda@xcite first obtained its solution in this case , latter garfinkle , horowitz and strominger@xcite find an another kind of solution , which is known as garfinkle - horowitz - strominger solution .",
    "it has been showed that there exist many essential differences between the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger black hole and the reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "this makes it necessary for us to study the qnms of garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton black hole , although the similar work of reissner - nordstrm de sitter black hole has been done by ref.@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the qnms of garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton black holes by evaluating the quasinormal mode frequencies both of scalar and dirac fields .",
    "+ many methods are available for calculating the quasinormal mode frequencies .",
    "most of them are numerical in nature . however , there are two methods often used , i.e. , wkb potential approximation , which was devised and developed in@xcite , and pschl - teller(pt ) potential approximation , which was first proposed by pschl and teller@xcite .",
    "both methods have their own merits .",
    "wkb approximation is accurate for the low - lying modes@xcite , while the pschl - teller approximation is simpler than the first one and accurate enough for our purpose .",
    "therefore , we utilize the first method to calculate the frequencies of the scalar field , but use the second method to calculate the frequencies of the massive dirac field .",
    "moreover , we use these two methods to calculate the massless dirac field so that we can check the consistency between these two kinds of methods .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we study the scalar qnms in garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton black hole , and evaluate their quasinormal mode frequencies.in sec.iii , we discuss the dirac qnms and calculate their characteristic frequencies .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "we consider the qnms in the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger black hole described by the metric@xcite @xmath2 with @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath5 is magnetic charge , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are scalar and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 and @xmath10 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "+ the best way to deal with the qnms for the scalar field is to solve equations@xcite deduced from the action .",
    "however , it is very difficult , if possible , to solve these equations because we must find general solutions rather than static , spherically symmetric solutions which obtained in ref.@xcite when we discuss scalar qnms in garfinkle - horowitz - strominger black hole . under this consideration ,",
    "we use another effective way to solve this question , the way has been used to discuss the entropy in garfinkle - horowitz - strominger black hole in ref.@xcite .",
    "+ the scalar field with mass @xmath0 satisfies the wave equation @xmath11 if we introduce a tortoise coordinate      and define @xmath13 then the wave equation can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15.\\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is an extremal black hole for garfinkle - horowitz - strominger black hole when @xmath16 , since there exists a curvature singularity at @xmath17 as showed in eqs.(1 - 5 ) . in this case , many new unknown properties occur and thus further work is needed . in this article , we only calculate the quasinormal mode frequencies when @xmath18 .",
    "it is obvious that the effective potential satisfies @xmath19 as @xmath0 is increased , the peak value of the effective potential will be smaller than the asymptotic value @xmath20 .",
    "reference @xcitepointed out that there will be no quasinormal modes if the peak of the potential is lower than the asymptotic value @xmath20 , i.e. , there exists a maximum value above which quasinormal modes can not occur .",
    "therefore , one can estimate its value @xmath21 by using the relation @xmath22 the results are tabulated in table i. here we have used the mass @xmath4 of the black hole as a unit of mass .",
