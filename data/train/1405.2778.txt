    "this equation is integrated with time using second - order integrators which can preserve the geometric properties of particle orbits ( zhu et al .",

    "the vertical gravity is very small close to the disk midplane , the unstratified disk setup is a good approximation for simulating the gas dynamics there ( e.g. within half the gas scale height of the disk ) .",

    "d and e , the 1-d model reproduces the dust density peaks very accurately , confirming that the density peaks in the dust are due to axisymmetric structures in the gas disk ( e.g. , zonal flows ) .    in ad runs , since the turbulence is very weak , the evolution of the dust in our simulations is dominated by the radial drift . to study radial turbulent diffusion in ad cases",

    "normally , some regions in global disks are more resolved than others due to the grid spacing , and the global structure of the density , temperature and magnetic fields .",
    "for example , with uniform grid spacing and @xmath349 , our standard cases have the resolution of 7@xmath350 in the @xmath84 and @xmath7 directions at the inner boundary and 90@xmath350 at the outer boundary . in order to quantify the resolvability at different radii in disks",
    ", we plot the quality factors @xmath351 and @xmath352 as a function of @xmath84 at the end of these simulations .",
    "the quality factor @xmath351 is defined as the number of grid cells that resolve the fastest mri growing mode ( noble et al .",
    "2010 ) , @xmath353 where @xmath354 in ideal mhd , and in mhd with ad @xmath355 where @xmath356 ( wardle 1999 , bai & stone 2011 ) . with @xmath357 , @xmath358 .",
    "@xmath359 is defined in the same way as @xmath360 but using @xmath361 .",
    "the quality factor is averaged in both @xmath86 and @xmath7 directions at each @xmath84 . in figure",
    "[ fig : evgqz ] , the solid black curves are @xmath362 , while the dotted black curves are @xmath363 .",
    "sorathia et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have shown that if @xmath364 , @xmath362 needs to be @xmath365 , and if @xmath366 , @xmath362 can be smaller ( @xmath297 6 in their figure 8) . figure",
    "[ fig : evgqz ] shows that even our standard simulations have @xmath367 and @xmath368 in most regions , except those close to the inner boundary where vertical magnetic fields are lost through the inner boundary .",
    "another diagnostic metric proposed by sorathia et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is the fraction @xmath352 of grids that resolve the fastest growing modes by at least eight grid cells .",
    "@xmath369 where the logical statement within the integral takes the value of one if the statement is true , and zero if the statement is false .",
    "the @xmath352 factors from our simulations are shown in figure [ fig : evgqz ] as the blue curves .",
    "solid blue curves are @xmath370 , and the dotted blue curves are @xmath371 . for most of our standard runs ( except ad2.5e4 ) , we have @xmath372 and @xmath373 , which means that around half of the grids have resolved the mri fastest growing modes and the simulations should be converged ( sorathia et al .",
    "2012 ) . for our high resolution runs , @xmath370 and @xmath371",
    "are larger than 0.8 in most regions , indicating most regions in our simulations have been fully resolved .",
    "we have studied dust transport in turbulent protoplanetary disks using three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations including lagrangian dust particles . the turbulence is driven by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in either ideal or non - ideal mhd with ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) .",
    "our aim is to test if the evolution and vertical structure of the dust disk in global 3-d mhd simulations can be reproduced by simple 1-d models .",
    "if simple 1-d models can be justified , the evolution of dust can be studied in long timescales without the need of expensive 3-d mhd simulations .    * in ideal mhd runs , we confirm that the dust radial diffusion coefficient measured in simulations agree well with the analytical formulae in youdin & lithwick ( 2007 ) with the assumption of @xmath374 .",
    "* both the surface density evolution and vertical structure of the dust disk in 3-d global unstratified simulations can be roughly reproduced by simple azimuthally averaged 1-d and analytical models ( except for dust with @xmath190 ) .",
    "* however , in order to capture particle trapping by pressure bumps due to mri turbulence , we need a more refined 1-d model that uses the evolution of gas surface density from 3-d mhd simulations . * there is a noticeable discrepancy between mhd simulations and azimuthally averaged 1-d models for surface density of dust having @xmath3751 , indicating that non - axisymmetric density features in mri turbulent disks can affect these particles significantly . * in ad runs , turbulence is significantly suppressed , and the evolution of dust in our simulations is dominated by particle radial drift .",
    "the vertical structure of the dust disk can again be fitted by the simple analytical model but it requires a much larger @xmath208 than the value in ideal mhd runs .",
    "* by carrying out both unstratified and stratified local shearing box simulations with lagrangian particles , we find that @xmath208 is @xmath376 in our ad runs . on the other hand , @xmath207 can range from much smaller than to much larger than @xmath95 , depending on the strength of the net magnetic field . * in unstratified ad simulations ,",
    "we observe that , at some parts of the disk , @xmath178 can be even correlated over the whole simulation time .",
    "this may imply that the linear growing mode still persists in the nonlinear phase and affects particle dynamics .",
    "* in deal mhd runs , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , implying angular momentum transport is more efficient than dust diffusion .",
    "however , in ad runs , both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath5 implying dust diffusion is more efficient than angular momentum transport in the outer part of the protoplanetary disk where ad dominates .",
    "* the difference on particle diffusion between ad and ideal mhd runs is due to that the presence of ad changes both the temporal autocorrelation function and power spectrum of turbulence . in ad runs ,",
    "the temporal autocorrelation function has a long correlation time for @xmath178 , while the correlation time for @xmath232 can be either long or short sensitively depending on the net magnetic field strength .",
    "the temporal power spectrum also flattens or even increases at high frequencies ( or short timescales ) .",
    "since the detailed form of the power spectrum determines dust diffusion coefficients for particles with @xmath377 , the formulae given by youdin & lithwick ( 2007 ) are not applicable for describing diffusion of big particles in ad disks . * for global unstratified simulations ,",
    "the amplitude of zonal flows becomes smaller when the turbulence becomes weaker .",
    "the weak zf in ad runs can not trap particles significantly .",
    "the ratio between the zf amplitude ( @xmath378 ) and @xmath108 is @xmath2973 for ideal mhd runs and @xmath29710 for ad runs .",
    "the width of the zonal flow is 0.5 - 1 ( 5 - 10 disk scale heights ) in ideal mhd runs , while significantly narrower in ad runs . in our ideal mhd simulations ,",
    "zonal flows can increase the dust surface density by a factor of three as long as zonal flows can persist over the particle drift timescale .",
    "this study suggests that turbulent disks in non - ideal mhd with ad have dramatically different dust diffusion coefficients than those in ideal mhd .",
    "future studies on particle diffusion in mri turbulent disks dominated by non - ideal mhd effects is necessary for understanding dust transport in realistic protoplanetary disks .",
