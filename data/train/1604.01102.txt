    "despite its great success , the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics can not be the final description of nature and it has been shown that in some of its extensions , string theory , for example , it is possible that lorentz symmetry is violated @xcite .",
    "the observation of any , though feeble , signal of lorentz symmetry violation ( lsv ) would represent a great breakthrough and demand the re - examination of the very basis of modern physics , i.e. theory of relativity and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "a possible realization of lsv is achieved by considering a lagrangian model where a field with non - trivial spin acquires a non - zero vacuum expectation value ",
    "see e.g. ref.@xcite . in view of this work",
    ", one can introduce general non - dynamical tensors @xcite and exploit several different couplings to the matter and gauge sectors of the sm @xcite-@xcite . for a review of theory and experimental tests of cpt- and lorentz - invariance ,",
    "see refs.@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the case of a lsv background 4-vector coupled directly to the photon sector , thus leaving the lepton sector untouched .",
    "an interesting prospect to implement lsv in the ( 1 + 3 ) maxwell sector was originally proposed by s. carroll , g. field and r. jackiw @xcite through the following cpt - odd chern - simons - like lagrangian @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the usual 4-potential and @xmath2 is the dual of the electromagnetic field - strength tensor ( we adopt @xmath3 ) . in calculations",
    "we shall adopt @xmath4 , where the coupling @xmath5 has canonical dimension of mass , while @xmath6 is dimensionless .",
    "this term is gauge - invariant if @xmath7 , that is , @xmath6 is a constant 4-vector , thus providing a preferred direction in space - time , i.e. , a background , and breaking lorentz invariance .",
    "it is possible , nevertheless , to give it a dynamic nature , where it may be interpreted as a pseudo - scalar field  see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that this term can be radiatively generated when fermions couple to the electromagnetic field via a non - minimal covariant derivative , @xmath8 .",
    "the constant 4-vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 are therefore related , but the exact numerical relation between them has been long debated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "usual qed augmented by the cfj lagrangian is essentially a subset of the so - called minimal standard model extension @xcite .",
    "some of the classical features of this particular scenario were studied e.g. in ref.@xcite , where it was shown that the cfj interaction ( also with a non - zero proca mass term @xcite ) with a pure space - like background is stable , unitary and preserves causality , whereas time- and light - like backgrounds are potentially problematic @xcite .",
    "a space - like background is therefore the only healthy scenario available .",
    "an important remark is in order at this point : the considerations above apply to a truly fixed , time - independent , background .",
    "these requirements are only explicit in an inertial reference frame , which is not the case of the earth due to its sideral and orbital motions : in the lab the background would seem to rotate .",
    "a convenient and approximately inertial frame is , for example , the one attached to the sun  the so - called sun - centered frame ( scf ) @xcite  which is broadly used in the literature @xcite .    in order to translate the accessible , but time - dependent , background as observed on earth , @xmath11 , in terms of combinations of the constant @xmath12",
    ", we employ a general lorentz transformation , i.e. , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is given in ref.@xcite . if we ignore sub - dominant boost effects of order @xmath15 , we may write @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the rotation matrix is explicitly time - dependent ( @xmath18 is the time in the scf ) .",
    "since experiments are usually conducted over long time - scales , the lsv signatures observed in earth - bound experiments would be , thus , an effective time averages .",
    "the only non - vanishing ( time - averaged ) spatial components are then @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the co - latitude of the experiment .",
    "as discussed below , the effects we consider in this paper are linear in @xmath22 , therefore only the @xmath23- and @xmath24-components of the background in the lab will be relevant to our analyses . both may be expressed in terms of @xmath25 and our goal is precisely to constrain it .",
    "the cfj lagrangian above would induce optical effects during the propagation of radiation through vacuum ( see section [ sec_cav ] ) , and carroll , field and jackiw used data on the rotation of the plane of polarization from distant galaxies in order to impose strong limits on @xmath5 .",
    "given that no significant evidence of such effects was found , they could set a tight upper bound on the lsv parameter , namely , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "limits on this parameter have been searched for in many contexts , mainly astrophysical , e.g. cmb polarization @xcite , and are currently as strict as @xmath27 ( see ref.@xcite , table d12 , and references therein ) .    here",
    "we apply eq .",
    "to systems available at much shorter distance scales , where earth - bound laboratory experiments may be used to constrain the predicted lsv effects .",
    "this is a valid effort , given that the apparatus is under the experimeter s control , as opposed to cosmological or astrophysical tests where sizeable uncertainties may arise due to complicated models describing the interstellar medium and light propagation therein .",
    "we discuss lsv effects in the context of the cfj modification of qed in two main fronts : energy shifts in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and the generation of an electric dipole moment for charged leptons .",
    "we also briefly address measurements of rotation in the polarization of light in resonant cavities .",
    "as we shall see , the lsv - induced corrections to the coulomb potential appear already at tree - level via velocity- and spin - dependent interaction potentials . for the leptonic electric dipole moment ( @xmath28edm ) , on the other hand , it is necessary to compute the one - loop correction to the corresponding form factor , which is found to be explicitly momentum - dependent , thus allowing for an enhancement in high energies . despite of this interesting feature",
    ", we expect it to remain unaccessable to experiment in the foreseable future .",
    "resonant cavities would present , nonetheless , a good prospect to perform local tests on lsv and to potentially constrain @xmath25 even further .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec_pots ] we discuss the interparticle potential between leptons and apply it to the hydrogen atom and , in section [ sec_edm ] , we calculate the one - loop cfj contribution to the @xmath28edm . in section [ sec_cav ]",
    "we address some classical features of the model and connect it to a resonant cavity .",
    "section [ sec_conc ] is devoted to our concluding remarks .",
    "we use natural units ( @xmath29 ) throughout .",
    "the cfj parity - odd lagrangian , eq . , modifies the quadratic piece of the usual maxwell sector in qed , therefore altering the propagator of the photon .",
    "this modification entails that photon - mediated interactions will necessarily include a ( small ) lsv signature , possibly giving rise to anisotropies involving the fixed background .",
    "the relatively high precision attained in spectroscopy experiments motivates us to consider the effect of the cfj corrections to the coulomb potential in the study of atomic systems , the simplest of which is the hydrogen atom . to do so",
    ", one needs to compute the potential ( operator ) between the proton  here treated as a point - like , structureless , fermion  and the electron .",
    "the interaction of two spin-1/2 fermions can be treated in the non - relativistic ( nr ) regime through the concept of interparticle potential , which is given by the first born approximation @xcite , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the nr amplitude , @xmath32 is the mometum transfer and @xmath33 is the relative position vector .",
    "the one - photon exchange amplitude may be schematically written as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 represent the contraction of the on - shell ( external ) spinors and the @xmath36 vertex , and @xmath37 is the effective photon propagator .",
    "given that lsv effects are expected to be tiny , we do not use the full propagator @xcite , but merely consider the cfj term as a true bilinear interaction in the photon sector , i.e. , an effective vertex to be inserted into the usual qed propagator , @xmath38 . under these assumptions",
    "one may write the cfj vertex as @xcite @xmath39 while the qed tree - level vertex remains unaltered and reads @xmath40 .",
    "we consider the interaction in the center of mass frame , in which fermion  1 \" has incoming and outgoing momenta denoted by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , where @xmath43 is the average mometum and @xmath44 is the momentum carried by the virtual photon .",
    "similar definitions hold for fermion  2 \" ( with @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",

    "we now plug eq . into the definition of @xmath58 in order to obtain the following potentials , @xmath59 + \\nonumber \\\\ & + & 1 \\leftrightarrow 2 ,      \\label{pot2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the reduced mass of the system and @xmath61 is the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the electric charges were set as @xmath62 , with @xmath63 being the electromagnetic fine structure constant .",
    "the final result is just the sum of eqs . and : @xmath64 , and it represents an additional lsv contribution to the well - known coulomb interaction between two charges .",
    "we note , furthermore , the pseudo - scalar character of these potentials  a clear sign of their cpt - odd origins .",
    "the potentials above are spin- and velocity - dependent and could produce interesting consequences at the macroscopic level , inducing deviations in the dominant coulomb force in the form of possible angle - dependent corrections to the inverse - square law observable in experiments involving e.g. spin - polarized objects @xcite . if , for simplicity , we consider instead the interaction energy between two charged but unpolarized bodies as given by @xmath65 , we may extract the force per interacting pair of particles as @xmath66 , that is @xmath67 ,      \\label{force}\\ ] ] where we assumed that @xmath68 is much greater than the typical dimensions of bodies  1 \" and  2 \" and that body  2 \" is stationary ( @xmath69 ) and centered at the origin .",
    "the total force would be @xmath70 , where @xmath71 describes the effective number of interacting particles .",
    "this force would act as a small velocity - dependent perturbation to the dominating coulomb ( and gravitational ) interaction between the two electrically charged objects .    the first term in eq .",
    "represents a precession of the 3-momentum @xmath72 around the axis defined by the fixed background @xmath73 . to see this",
    "it suffices to consider that @xmath74 , so that the module of @xmath72 is constant , i.e. , time - independent .",
    "similarly , the angle given by @xmath75 is also fixed in time ( for small periods where the time - dependence of @xmath73 itself can be neglected ) , so that the 3-momentum circles around the direction of @xmath73 .",
    "the second term shares more similarities with the typical coulomb force , since it is radial and decays with the inverse square of the distance , but contains an unusual dependece on angular momentum , which also controls whether this term is attractive or repulsive . besides the discussion above in terms of the lsv - originated force on charged leptons , the interaction from eq . may also induce a spontaneous torque on a pair of charges @xcite .",
    "we now turn to our main interest : the application of our results , eqs . and , to the hydrogen atom .",
    "given that the proton is a thousand times heavier than the electron , @xmath76 reads @xmath77   \\label{pot}\\ ] ] which represents a lorentz violating cpt - odd correction to the electron - proton electromagnetic interaction . according to usual quantum - mechanical time - independent perturbation theory ,",
    "in order to evaluate the first - order energy shift associated with this perturbation , we need to calculate @xmath78 , with @xmath79 being adequate eigenstates of the free hydrogen atom .",
    "since the problem involves not only the orbital angular momentum , but also the spin degrees of freedom , we need to build the angular wave functions for the total angular momentum , @xmath80 , which are given below for the case of a generic orbital angular mometum @xmath81 coupled to a spin-1/2 : @xmath82 both with @xmath83 . the final normalized wave functions are then @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the well - known spherical harmonics and radial function for the hydrogen atom , and @xmath87 are the spin eigenfunctions . here , @xmath6  not to be confused with the background , @xmath28 and @xmath88 are the principal , angular and azimuthal quantum numbers , respectively",
    "as discussed in section [ sec_intro ] , after averaging , the background as seen in the lab is given by @xmath89 , where we omit the sub - script for convenience .",
    "with this , the total energy shift is given by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 \\label{de1 } \\\\",

    "\\label{de3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the bohr radius ) .",
    "it is easy to check that , for @xmath94 , we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 , so that @xmath97 where we used that the contribution proportional to @xmath98 is automatically zero due to the orthogonality of the functions involved .",
    "similar arguments lead to @xmath99 .",
    "finally , @xmath100 may be written as @xmath101 , cf .",
    "eq . , and , after employing the algebra of angular momentum @xcite , we find @xmath102 , so that our final result reads @xmath103 with a similar expression for the @xmath104 case .",
    "the quantity obtained above represents the energy shift to the spectral lines of hydrogen due to lorentz violating effects .",
    "the aforementioned spectrum is known to a high level of accuracy and the fact that no deviations have been found allows us to place an upper bound on the magnitude of @xmath105 .",
    "optimistically , we may use the currently best precision in spectroscopic measurements , @xmath106 @xcite , and demand that @xmath107 , i.e. , we demand that the lsv effect lies below experimental uncertainty . from this requirement",
    "we obtain the upper bound ( @xmath108 ) @xmath109 at the @xmath110 level @xcite",
    "if an elementary particle possesses a non - zero electric dipole moment , @xmath111 , it has to point in the direction of its spin , since this is the only vector available in the rest frame of the particle .",
    "when placed in an external electric field the particle will be subject to an interaction of the form @xmath112 , which can be recast as @xmath113 , and this interaction term violates both p- and t - symmetries .",
    "standard qed , on the other hand , is parity - invariant , so that such an electric dipole interaction can not be described by pure qed processes , that is , @xmath114 .    within the standard model it is possible to generate a small leptonic edm when strong and electroweak interactions are taken into account @xcite-@xcite . for the electron ,",
    "its theoretical magnitude is bounded by @xmath115 , while the best experimental limit is @xmath116 , at @xmath117 cl @xcite .",
    "the relatively strong experimental bounds on @xmath118 can be used as a means to extract limits on the physical properties of new particles , such as axions @xcite , supersymmetric particles @xcite , majorana neutrinos @xcite and dark matter @xcite .",
    "we shall now turn to the actual calculation of the lsv contribution to @xmath119 .",
    "it is clear that the tree - level contribution to the @xmath28edm is zero in the cfj scenario  the tree - level qed @xmath36 vertex remains unaltered ",
    "so we must look at higher orders .",
    "the first non - zero contribution comes from the one - loop vertex correction diagram , as shown in fig .. following the momentum assignments we have @xmath120 where @xmath121 \\left [ ( p - k)^{2 } - m_{\\ell}^{2 }   \\right ] } ,    \\label{edm1}\\ ] ] and we observe that the superficial degree of divergence of this diagram is @xmath122 , meaning that it behaves as @xmath123 in the uv limit . remembering that the corresponding diagram in usual qed , which describes the g - factor , displays a superficial logarithmic divergence",
    ", we conclude that the role of the vertex insertion is to reduce the degree of divergence and render the diagram uv - finite .    since the integral in eq .",
    "is finite in @xmath124 there is no need to regularize it and we directly evaluate the vertex correction as @xmath125 , with the momentum - dependent object @xmath126 being a complicated function involving products of up to five gamma matrices .",
    "we shall not give its expressions here .",
    "the vertex @xmath127 is the lsv contribution to @xmath119 we were looking for , but , in order to extract it , we need to obtain the corresponding form factor .",
    "the electromagnetic current can be decomposed as @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the desired form factor and the ellipsis denotes the other lorentz structures and their respective form factors , which are not of interest here @xcite . above @xmath130",
    "is the momentum transfer . in this paper",
    "we consider only the lsv effects in the photon sector , so no other form factor other than @xmath129 is relevant , as the ( free ) dirac equation remains unaltered .",
    "the vertex function @xmath127 plays the role of a lsv correction to the usual electromagnetic current , so that our task is to extract @xmath129 and read the @xmath28edm , which is then given by @xmath131 .",
    "obtaining @xmath129 is cumbersome due to the complicated form of @xmath127 .",
    "it is possible , however , to simplify matters by applying an appropriate projector @xcite : @xmath132 $ ] , which automatically selects the form factor we want .",
    "the projector above acts on the vertex correction and we obtain @xmath133 $ ] , with the trace evaluated for external ( on - shell ) leptons , that is , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . at this point",
    "it is convenient to leave @xmath136 in order to extract the finite contributions from the trace above in the limit of massless photons .",
    "this task may be performed in an automated fashion through the use of hiren patel s package - x @xcite , and the form factor is found to be : @xmath137 + \\text{ir } , \\label{fedm}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 indicates infra - red terms .",
    "such divergences appear as @xmath139 factors in the feynman integrals ( @xmath140 ) due to @xmath141 and as @xmath142 factors in the traces .",
    "the appearance of the latter may be interpreted as follows .",
    "we are considering the cfj correction as a true vertex and not using the associated full ( complete ) propagator  this is essentially equivalent to taking only the lowest - order term in @xmath143 in the expansion of the complete propagator .",
    "however , the loop integration does not contemplate only high momenta , but also regions where @xmath144 may not be fulfiled , so we expect these divergences to vanish upon using the complete lsv - modified propagator .    finally , by using that @xmath130 and the definition of the edm in terms of the associated form factor , we obtain : @xmath145 which shows that the @xmath28edm is momentum - dependent .",
    "a simular effect was found in ref.@xcite for a different sector of the standard model extension @xcite , but with a quadratic momentum dependence .",
    "it is interesting to note , though not surprising , that , in a space - time with a fixed non - dynamic background , the spin is not the only vector available to support the electric ( or magnetic ) moment of an elementary particle .",
    "furthermore , in order to build the scalar @xmath119 we need another vector , and the only possibilities are @xmath146 and @xmath147  in our case , the special combination given by @xmath148 . this may be interpreted in terms of an interplay between the background and the applied electromagnetic field , which carries the momentum transfer @xmath44 , so that , together , they produce a non - vanishing @xmath28edm , i.e. , induce an asymmetry in the charge distribution of the lepton .",
    "we note , however , that the form of the @xmath28edm as given by eq .",
    "is not helpful from the experimental point of view : for an elastic interaction ( @xmath149 ) with @xmath150 we have @xmath151 . besides this , two aspects are specially relevant here : the nature of the measurements ( e.g. as performed by the acme collaboration @xcite ) and its time - scale .",
    "let us first decompose the ( say ) initial momentum of the electron as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 denote the components of the momentum relative to the molecule and the scf , respectively .",
    "the first aspect is connected with the form of @xmath154 and the fact that acme s measurements were performed with ( tho ) molecules , around which the electrons quickly revolve .",
    "being bound to it , their momenta are also limited and , over time , average to zero , i.e. , @xmath155 .",
    "similar arguments would apply for  free \" relativistic leptons in storage rings @xcite .",
    "this brings us to the second point .    since @xmath156",
    "does not contribute , one should consider the general motion of earth and the experiment attached to it relative to the scf , cf . section [ sec_intro ] .",
    "the data from acme s latest result was taken during @xmath157 days , but these were spread over months , and their analysis was not sensitive to such possible long - term time modulations .",
    "the momentum of the lab relative to the scf is @xmath158 , with the boost factor @xmath159 given by eq.(c2 ) in ref.@xcite , where it becomes clear that all components of @xmath160 are periodic functions of time .",
    "therefore , the time - averaged lsv effects @xmath161 also vanish and the application of the upper limit on the eedm @xcite as a means to constrain the space - like lsv parameters is not possible .    in any case , in a speculative note , if we could use the bound on the lsv parameter given in ref.@xcite , @xmath162 , the energy ( or momentum ) necessary to reach the upper limit of @xmath163 would be @xmath164 .",
    "this indicates that the cfj contribution to the eedm would only be sensible for extreme energies , around the planck scale , @xmath165 , therefore remaining out of experimental reach for the foreseeable future ( qed is also expected to break down at such high energy scale ) .",
    "this suggests that the cfj model induces only very small effects and is , therefore , not responsible for a finite eedm , should one be eventually found .",
    "the cfj lagrangian , eq . , is cpt - odd : in the case of a pure time - like background vector , @xmath166 , we obtain @xmath167 , while for the purely space - like case , @xmath168 , a similar calculation shows that @xmath169 , with @xmath170 and @xmath171 the electric and magnetic fields , respectively . in the light of parity and time reflection transformations",
    "these terms show a clear pseudo - scalar character .    adding eq . to the usual maxwell kinetic term , @xmath172 , and",
    "varying the action with respect to @xmath173 gives us the lsv - modified maxwell equations : @xmath174 ( in the absence of matter sources ) . in momentum space ,",
    "gauss and ampre s laws become @xmath175 where we temporarily absorbed @xmath5 in @xmath73 ; @xmath176 and @xmath177 are the 3-momentum and energy of the photon , respectively .",
    "the magnetic gauss and farady s induction laws remain untouched , since they stem from @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "it is simple to see that @xmath171 is simultaneously perpendicular to both @xmath177 and @xmath170 , but , from the second equation above , one finds that the electric field is not purely transverse , but rather satisfies @xmath179 .",
    "this implies that the poynting vector @xmath180 is not entirely parallel to the wave vector @xmath177 , a situation also encountered in e.g. electro - anisotropic uniaxial media @xcite .",
    "another important information that may be obtained from the ( general ) maxwell equations above concerns the dispersion relations . working out the modified maxwell equations one finds from the wave operators that the wave 4-vector satisfies @xmath181 which , for the case of a space - like background , are approximately given by @xmath182 , where @xmath183 .",
    "this means not only that different modes propagate with different velocities , but also that the polarization plane is rotated by an amount @xmath184 after traveling a length @xmath185 @xcite ( assuming that the experiment lies in the @xmath186 plane in the reference frame of the lab ) .",
    "a similar effect , farady rotation , is observed whenever a linearly polarized wave passes through a dielectric exposed to an external magnetic field ( aligned with the wave vector ) .",
    "incidentally , if we express @xmath170 and @xmath171 in terms of the scalar and vector potentials , @xmath187 and @xmath188 , in the rhs of eqs . and",
    ", we arrive at lsv - modified maxwell equations which are formally identical to its lorentz - preserving counterpart in a dielectric medium , but here @xmath189 and @xmath190 play the role of the polarization and magnetization , respectively @xcite .",
    "experiments such as pvlas @xcite use high finesse resonant cavities to search for the electromagnetic properties of the vacuum @xcite with intense lasers and are highly sensitive to rotations in polarization .",
    "since at every reflection the direction of the propagation is inverted ( @xmath191 ) , the net rotation before and after reflection cancels on average ; therefore , we use only one pass .",
    "resonant cavities are usually designed to allow for the highest number possible of reflections ( passes ) , therefore amplifying the effective optical path , but here we would like to obtain a rough estimate of the uncertainty in the measurement of polarization rotations over one single pass .    the final relative uncertainty on the rotation of polarization after @xmath192 effective passes ",
    "@xmath193 is the path - length amplification factor  is @xmath194 ( at @xmath110 ) @xcite , so that , for a single pass , we can estimate an uncertainty of @xmath195 .",
    "if we consider the pvlas cavity with path length @xmath196 and a relative uncertainty of @xmath197 for the rotation in polarization , we may obtain an upper bound on @xmath198  including a conservative factor of @xmath199  by imposing that the lsv - induced birefringence in vacuum is smaller than @xmath197 , i.e. , @xmath200 .    with this simple assumption we may estimate that the lsv parameters in terms of the ( time - averaged ) scf variable @xmath201 ( cf .",
    "section [ sec_intro ] ) are bounded as @xmath202 whereby we note that more precise measurements and/or larger @xmath203 from e.g. the bmv experiment @xcite could potentially improve this upper limit and , hopefullly , eventually supersede the astrophysical bounds @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec_intro ] , a time - like background brings theoretical difficulties  this is the reason why we assumed @xmath204 so far .",
    "however , if we insist on considering this possibility , we might be able to find stringent bounds on it .",
    "we work in the same approximation level as with the space - like components , i.e. , we neglect effects of order @xmath15 , so that @xmath205  here the @xmath206 contributions are all time - dependent and are effectively washed away after time averaging @xcite .    working out the dispersion relation , eq . , for this specific case , we find that the two frequency modes induce a rotation in the polarization given by @xmath207 , where @xmath208",
    ". this rotation does not depend on the projection of the linear momentum onto the ( space - like ) background , so there is no cancellation upon reflexion ; we are then allowed to use @xmath194 . with this , we may estimate the following upper limit on a pure time - like lsv background ( @xmath209 ) : @xmath210 which supports the theoretical indications that @xmath211 should be either exactly zero or extremely small @xcite .    furthermore , we would like to note that this extrapolation could also be applied to the results in section [ sec_pots ] , but the limits on the time - component of the background would be essentially of the same order of magnitude as the one for the spatial components ( cf .",
    "for this reason we refrain from re - doing the calculation explicitly for this case . also , the conclusions in section [ sec_edm ] would not change by assuming a non - zero time - like component as we are in a regime where @xmath149 , so we would still be unable to apply the experimental limits .",
    "in this paper we have studied a specific modification of standard qed , namely the carroll - field - jackiw model given by eq .",
    ", in two different contexts : the interparticle potential between spin-1/2 fermions and the associated quantum - mechanical corrections to the spectrum of the hydrogen atom , the electric dipole moment of charged leptons at the one - loop level , as well as a brief application to resonant cavities , which incidentally provided the best upper bound on the lsv parameters .",
    "the bounds obtained are far less strict than that of ref.@xcite and those listed in ref.@xcite , but contrary to them , ours were extracted from local phenomena and experiments , therefore not depending upon astrophysical observations over cosmological distance scales and associated uncertainties .    our study of the interparticle potential mediated by the lsv - modified propagator led us to spin- and velocity - dependent interactions which could interfere with the dominant coulomb and gravitational forces between ( un)polarized charged macroscopic objects .",
    "next , we applied @xmath212 as a quantum - mechanical perturbation to the hydrogen atom , obtaining @xmath105 , eq .",

    "the background - dependent correction @xmath212 , eq . , produces not only energy shifts in the spectrum , but may also induce changes in the ( free ) wave functions themselves .",
    "such perturbed states ( @xmath213 ) could give rise to other interesting effects , such as the generation of atomic electric dipole moments , @xmath214 , as well as induce non - zero quadrupole moments in the otherwise spherically symmetric ground state of the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "these are very interesting points and will be further examined and addressed elsewhere .",
    "in section [ sec_edm ] we found that the background 4-vector may serve as support for a non - zero @xmath28edm , which is also explicitly momentum - dependent , see eq .. however , due to the dependence of @xmath119 on @xmath215 , but not on the _ average _ momentum @xmath216 , and the experimental techniques used to measure it , we have not been able to set bounds on the lsv parameters .    finally , our best bound on @xmath217 , eq . , was obtained from the non - observation of an lsv - induced vacuum birefringence , an effect analogous to faraday rotation .",
    "we have not gone in the details of the cavity design , but rather outlined a general estimate",
    ". a closer analysis of the cavity operation and geometry would be able to refine it further , but our discussion indicates that this is a promising way to study not only non - linear properties of the vacuum predicted by qed or new beyond the standard model particles , e.g. axion - like particles and hidden photons @xcite , but also lorentz violation and its induced effects on the electromagnetic vacuum @xcite ( for a more thourough overview see also ref.@xcite , table d12 , and references therein ) .",
