    "a number of _ rosat _ and _ asca _ x - ray observations of low luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have shown clear evidence for absorption by highly - ionized gas along the line - of - sight ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1992 ; turner et al 1993 ; reynolds 1997 ; george et al 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of such gas is revealed primarily by the ovii and oviii absorption edges imprinted on the underlying continuum .",
    "recent studies show that the ionized gas generally has a relatively large column density ( corresponding to effective hydrogen column densities @xmath6@xmath7 , although there are obvious selection effects due the bandpasses and sensitivities of the instruments ) , and exists in @xmath875% of seyfert - i galaxies ( reynolds 1997 ; george et al 1997 , thereafter g97 ) .",
    "the situation in the case of higher - luminosity agn is less clear .",
    "recent studies have shown that a large fraction of radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) show evidence for intrinsic absorption ( cappi et al 1997 ) .",
    "the ionization state of the material generally can not be determined from current data , although there is strong evidence that it is highly ionized in at least two cases ( 3c  351 , fiore et al 1993 ; 3c  273 , grandi et al 1997 ) .",
    "interestingly , intrinsic absorption appears to be far less common in radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , which are thought to make up @xmath990% of total quasar population ( laor et al 1997 ; fiore et al 1997 ) .",
    "indeed there is only two cases documented to - date : mr  2251 - 178 ( halpern 1984 , pan , stewart & pounds 1990 , mineo & stewart 1993 ) and iras  13349 + 2438 ( brandt , fabian & pounds 1996 ) .",
    "such a difference between the two classes could be taken to mean that gas does not exist along the line  of  sight in rqqs .",
    "alternatively , a substantial column density of gas could be present , but so highly ionized to be transparent in the x - ray band , or that the absorption features imprinted by such gas could be swamped by continuum photons arriving via another ( transparent ) travel - path .",
    "pg  1114 + 445 ( @xmath10 ; schmidt & green 1983 ) is a rqq with @xmath11 , lying in a direction of relatively low galactic line - of - sight column density ( @xmath12 from the 21 cm measurements of murphy et al 1996 ) .",
    "these characteristics led to the inclusion of the source as one of 23 quasars forming the complete sample of the bright quasar survey , studied by the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on _ rosat _ ( laor et al 1997 ) .",
    "interestingly , pg  1114 + 445 was one of the few objects whose pspc spectrum could not be adequately modelled by a single power - law and the only object for which there was strong evidence for absorption by ionized material ( laor et al .",
    "further evidence for absorption by ionized material comes from a recent _ hst _ observation which has revealed uv absorption lines at civ , nv and ly@xmath13 ( mathur 1997 ) . here",
    "we present the results from a follow - up _ asca _ observation of pg  1114 + 445 , along with a reanalysis of the pspc data .",
    "the new observation reported here was performed using _ asca _ on 1996 may 0607 .",
    "the _ asca _ satellite ( makishima et al . 1996 ) consists of four identical , co - aligned x - ray telescopes ( xrts ; serlemitsos et al .",
    "two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis0 and sis1 ) , each consisting of four ccd chips , sit at the focus of two of the xrts , and provide coverage over the @xmath90.410  kev band ( burke et al .",
    "two gas imaging spectrometers ( known as gis2 and gis3 ) sit at the focus of the other two xrts , and provide coverage over the @xmath90.810  kev band ( ohashi et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) .",
    "the observation reported here was carried out in ` 1-ccd ` mode with the target in the nominal pointing position .",
    "the data collected in ` faint ` and ` bright ` telemetry modes were combined .",
    "we employed the same data selection criteria and data analysis methods for the _ asca _ data as presented in nandra et al ( 1997a ) using the ftools / xselect package ( v3.5 & 3.6 ) .",
    "combined , these gave rise to @xmath14@xmath15  s of useful data in each of the detectors , from which we derive mean source count rates of @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the sis0 and gis2 detectors respectively , and similar rates in sis1 and gis3 . the total number of source photons detected in each instrument was @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "we find no significant variability on timescales @xmath20  min , and only marginal evidence changes in flux on longer timescales .",
    "we have also independently analysed the _",
    "pspc observation of pg  1114 + 445 presented by laor et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , having obtained the data from the archive .",
    "this observation was carried out on 1993 jun 0607 , and using standard data selection and reduction techniques gives rise to @xmath21  s of useful data and a mean source count rate of @xmath22 .",
    "no significant variability was observed .",
    "a number of serendipitous sources are apparent within the field of view of _ rosat _ , at least one of which is also detected in the _ asca _ gis , but at sufficiently large angular distances not to affect the analysis of pg  1114 + 445 presented here .",
    "given the lack of strong variability during the observations , mean spectra were constructed for each detector , and it is the results from these that we concentrate on for the rest of the paper .",
    "as is common practice , in all cases we fit the data from each detector simultaneously , but allowing the normalization of each to be a free parameter to allow for differences in the sizes of the extraction cell used , along with any discrepancies in the absolute flux calibration of the individual telescope / detector systems .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed using ` xspec ` ( v9.01 ; arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "appropriate detector redistribution matrices were used ( those released 1994 nov 09 and 1995 mar 06 for the _ asca _ sis and gis respectively , and ` pspcb_gain2_256.rmf ` for the _ rosat _ pspc ) .",
    "the effective area appropriate for each dataset was calculated using ` ascaarf`(v2.5 ) for the _ asca _ data , and ` pcarf`(v2.1.0 ) for the pspc data . in the case of the sis data ,",
    "we have restricted our spectral analysis to energies @xmath23  kev due to residual uncertainties in the calibration of the sis / xrt instrument ( see dotani et al .",
    "1996 and the information provided by the _",
    "gof at nasa / gsfc ) .",
    "however , whilst the calibration is suspect at these energies , it is considered unlikely to be in error by @xmath24% .",
    "thus , following g97 we have also calculated the weighted mean of the data / model residuals ( @xmath25 ) , when the best - fitting model is extrapolated below 0.6  kev .",
    "the rationale behind this parameter is that it allows us to identify models , which are deemed acceptable @xmath26  kev , but in which the extrapolation to energies @xmath27  kev is inconsistent with the suspected size of the calibrations uncertainties .    the raw spectra extracted for each detector were grouped such that each resultant channel had at least 20 counts per bin , permitting us to use @xmath28 minimization during the spectral analysis .",
    "this results in a total of 511 spectral bins for the combined _ asca _ detectors , and 37 spectral bins for the pspc data . in passing ,",
    "we note that in the 0.6 - 0.8 kev band these grouped spectral bins are each typically 0.06  kev wide ( for both the sis and pspc datasets ) .",
    "this is comparable to the spectral resolution of the sis at the epoch of the observations ( fwhm @xmath29  kev ) and far smaller than the spectral resolution of the pspc ( fwhm @xmath30  kev ) within this energy band .",
    "appropriate background spectra were extracted from source - free regions of each detector .    we have compared a number of hypothetical models with the mean spectra . in all models considered here ,",
    "we have assumed an underlying continuum represented by a single power - law ( of photon index @xmath31 ) throughout the 0.110  kev band ( observers frame ) .",
    "all the models also include the effects of absorption by neutral material at @xmath32 parameterized by an effective hydrogen column density @xmath33 ( assuming the abundances and cross - sections of morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , which can be allowed to vary during the spectral analysis ( but constrained to be @xmath34 ) .",
    "most models include an additional column density @xmath35 of absorbing material at the redshift of the source .",
    "errors are quoted at 68% confidence for the appropriate number of interesting parameters ( where all free parameters are considered interesting except for the absolute normalization of the model ) .",
    "we find a simple power - law fit to the _ asca _ data in the 0.610  kev band confirms the presence of substantial absorption . if the absorbing material is assumed to be neutral we find @xmath36 or @xmath37 depending whether the material is assumed to be local or at the redshift of the quasar .",
    "both fits gave a photon index @xmath38 and statistically acceptable fits ( with reduced @xmath28 value of @xmath39 ) .",
    "however the extrapolation of both best - fitting models predicts fewer counts @xmath27  kev than observed by a factor @xmath40 , and give rise to an increase in @xmath28-statistic of @xmath41 ( for 6 additional spectral bins ) .",
    "such a discrepancy is far greater than can be accounted for remaining uncertainties in the instrumental calibration . as we shall see below , these solutions are artifacts of the presence of absorption by ionized gas .",
    "numerous elements have photoelectric absorption edges with threshold energies within the 0.61.0 kev band .",
    "however , for cosmic abundances , the opacity in this band is dominated by @xmath4-shell absorption by c , o and ne , and @xmath42-shell absorption by fe ( e.g. morrison & mccammon 1983 ) . given the redshift of pg  1114 + 445 , the most significant edges likely to be observable in _ asca _ spectra are those due to ovii and oviii , with rest  frame energies of 739 and 871  ev respectively .",
    "including such edges in our analysis ( fixing @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , we find optical depths in these species of @xmath45(ovii)@xmath46 and @xmath45(oviii)@xmath47 .",
    "such a model can be considered a crude parameterization of the absorption features imprinted by ionized gas along the line  of  sight to the nucleus .",
    "however , at such large optical depths absorption by other abundant elements is likely to be important also , hence a more detailed treatment is required . here",
    "we consider the case where the material is ionized by the central continuum , and employ theoretical spectra generated using the photoionization code ion ( netzer 1993 , 1996 , version ion95 ) .",
    "the ionization state of the gas is parameterized by the x - ray ionization parameter @xmath48 ( netzer 1996 ; where the ionizing radiation field is determined over the 0.110  kev band ) .",
    "further details on the assumptions made in the ion models and the method by which they were included in the spectral analysis can be found in g97 .",
    "we find that including the absorption by photoionized gas provides an excellent description of the _ asca _ data ( with @xmath49 ) , giving @xmath0 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( table  1 , line 1 ) .",
    "the addition of @xmath48 as an additional free parameter is significant at @xmath5299.9% confidence ( @xmath53-statistic of 33.7 ) .",
    "furthermore this model gives far better agreement with the _ asca _ data @xmath27  kev ( @xmath54 , consistent with the current uncertainties in the instrumental calibration ) .",
    "when such a model is assumed , we find @xmath33 consistent with @xmath55 , with an upper limit to any such excess absorption of @xmath56 ( table  1 , line 2 ) .",
    "the best - fitting model spectrum , along with the observed data / model ratios ( for the @xmath49 case ) are shown in fig  1 , and the @xmath28-contours in @xmath35@xmath48 space shown ( solid lines ) in fig  2 . as can be seen from fig .  1",
    ", for the best fitting values of @xmath35 and @xmath48 the intervening gas imprints a series of absorption edges on the underlying continuum , dominated by cvi , ovii and oviii .",
    "however , it should be noted that the ionization level of the gas is such that it becomes increasingly transparent as one moves to lower energies below the ovii edge ( 0.65  kev in the observer s frame ) .",
    "it is this behaviour that leads to a better agreement between the extrapolated model and the observed sis data @xmath27  kev , and we suggest , with the pspc data ( see below ) .",
    "we have considered models in which the ionized absorber attenuates only a fraction of the underlying continuum . however in all cases we find a covering - fraction consistent with 100% , thus such models are not considered further .",
    "stringent constraints can not be placed on the redshift of the ionized gas , @xmath57 , using the current data .",
    "however we do find @xmath58 at 90% confidence , consistent with the systemic redshift of the host galaxy , and limiting the ionized gas to be in an outflow / wind of velocity @xmath59 relative to the nucleus at the epoch of the observations ) prevents the velocity distribution of the ionized gas being constrained within @xmath60 .    with the assumption that our line - of - sight is not uniquely privileged , we have also tested whether any useful constraints can be obtained on the solid angle , @xmath61 , subtended by such gas at the central continuum source from its expected emission / scattering spectrum .",
    "however , the inclusion of such a component in the spectral analysis ( where @xmath35 and @xmath48 of the emitting gas is the same as those for the absorbing gas ) is inconclusive .",
    "we find an upper limit on the strength of such a component is that expected from a full shell of such material ( @xmath62 ) assuming it was irradiated by the continuum source with a luminosity a factor @xmath63 times greater than that derived from the observations .",
    "this is hardly surprising given that by far the bulk of the emission expected from ionized gas in this region of @xmath35 , @xmath48 parameter ",
    "space occurs below the ovii edge , and hence @xmath27  kev in the observer s frame .",
    "considering the pspc data alone , we confirm the results of laor et al ( 1994 ) that a single powerlaw does not provide an adequate description of the data ( giving @xmath64 ) , but that a statistically satisfactory fit can be obtained with the addition of a deep absorption edge . from our analysis , fixing @xmath33 at @xmath55 , we find a best fitting solution with an edge of optical depth @xmath65 at an energy @xmath66  kev ( in the rest  frame of the quasar ) imprinted on an underlying continuum with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "these values are in agreement with those found by laor et al ( 1994 ; @xmath69 at @xmath70  kev ) , and with a blend of the ovii and oviii edges found in the analysis of the _ asca _ data . repeating the analysis , but assuming the photoionization models described above ( with @xmath71 ) , we find @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with those obtained from the _ asca _ data above . however , despite the fact that the pspc provides some data at energies @xmath27  kev , the low signal - to - nose ratio of these data along with the relatively poor spectral resolution of the detector lead to few additional constraints on the state of the ionized gas being provided by the pspc data alone .      here",
    "we present the results from a joint analysis of both the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ datasets which may give better constraints on the properties of the ionized gas .",
    "as previously , the same spectral model is assumed for the data from each mission , but the normalization ( only ) of the underlying powerlaw is allowed to vary in order to allow for any intensity variations in the source over the 3 years between the observations .",
    "as expected , statistically acceptable results are obtained with the photoionization model ( table  1 lines 3 & 4 ) , with the flux during the _ rosat _ observation being a factor @xmath76% of that at the time of the _ asca _ observations .",
    "this is close to the accuracy of the the absolute flux calibration between the two instruments , so is not significant .",
    "it can be seen that the best - fitting parameters are also consistent with those derived when the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data are considered individually .",
    "the @xmath28-contours in @xmath35@xmath48 space assuming @xmath43 are also shown ( dashed curves ) in fig  2 . allowing the redshift of the ionized gas to vary during the analysis we find @xmath77 ( at 90% confidence ) , again consistent with the systemic redshift of the host galaxy , and limiting the ionized gas to have a velocity @xmath78 with respect to the nucleus . in passing ,",
    "we note however , that the best - fitting models for this combined analysis do consistently overpredict the number of counts observed in sis @xmath27  kev ( @xmath79@xmath80 ) .",
    "this may simply be due to the residual uncertainties in the calibration of the sis / xrt instrument at these energies , or be an artifact of fitting non - simultaneous datasets with different signal - to - noise ratios from instruments with very different energy resolutions .",
    "the strength of any emission component is restricted to be that from a full shell of such material assuming it was irradiated by the continuum source with a luminosity a factor @xmath81 times that derived from the observations .",
    "the analysis presented in  [",
    "sec : wabs ] did not take into account the potential presence of features in the 69  kev band ( in the rest  frame of the quasar ) due to fe @xmath4-shell transitions .",
    "indeed , the data / model residuals shown in fig .  1 do show a deficit in this energy range .",
    "this absorption feature appears to be present in all 4 _ asca _ detectors , and can be modelled with an absorption edge of energy @xmath82 ( in the rest  frame of the quasar ) and optical depth @xmath45 ( where @xmath83 for energies @xmath84 and zero elsewhere ) .",
    "considering the _ asca _ data alone and fixing @xmath43 , the addition of these two parameters results in an improvement of @xmath85 , significant at @xmath86% confidence ( @xmath53-statistic = 4.9 ) .",
    "we find @xmath87 and @xmath88  kev .",
    "the confidence contours in the @xmath82@xmath45 plane are shown in fig .",
    "3a , along with the corresponding edge energies for fe @xmath4-shell absorption .",
    "it can be seen that the edge is consistent with fei  fexix at 90% confidence for @xmath89 , assuming absorbing material in the rest  frame of the quasar .",
    "the best - fitting @xmath45 corresponds to an equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the abundance of fe relative to hydrogen .",
    "thus , if the fe feature is produced in the same material as is responsible for the o features observed @xmath92  kev discussed above ( @xmath50 ) , then we require @xmath93 , a factor @xmath5 greater than the most recent estimations of the cosmic abundance ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "we note that a yet superior fit is obtained if the absorption feature is assumed to be notch-shaped ( a saturated line with vertical sides , and @xmath94 within ) , giving @xmath95 compared to the model with no absorption .",
    "the best - fitting notch has an equivalent width of @xmath96  ev ( equivalent to one rebinned spectral bin ) and is centered at an energy @xmath97  kev ( in the rest  frame of the quasar ; fig.3b ) assuming this is indeed material in the rest  frame of the quasar , such an energy is consistent with resonance scattering by ni @xmath98 ( @xmath99nixxviii ) and fe @xmath100 ( @xmath52fexx ) .",
    "although both families of interactions include transitions with relatively large oscillator strengths ( @xmath1010.8 ) , both interpretations are problematic . in the former case ,",
    "the cosmic abundance of ni is far smaller than that for fe ( @xmath102 ) making such an interpretation unlikely due to the lack of corresponding features due to fe at lower energies . in the latter case",
    ", resonance scattering by fe @xmath98 will dominate that due to fe @xmath100 for ionization states @xmath52fexvi , again making such an interpretation unlikely due to the lack such a feature in 6.46.9  kev band .",
    "an alternative explanation of the notch is that it is due to resonance scattering by fe @xmath98 , but that the material is out  flowing ( @xmath103c for fexxv ) with respect to the rest - frame of the quasar .",
    "however , the instrumental and cosmic backgrounds start to become a noticeable fraction of the observed signal from pg  1114 + 445 in this observation above @xmath104  kev . given that both the sis and gis detectors contain background features in this region ( e.g. gendreau 1994 ; makishima et al .",
    "1996 ) , we consider the form of the absorption to require confirmation before more detailed interpretations can be made .",
    "emission features due to fe @xmath4-shell processes are common in low luminosity agn ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 ) , and have been claimed in high luminosity agn ( e.g. williams et al .",
    "1992 ; nandra et al 1996 ) .",
    "with such a deep fe absorption in our spectrum , we might expect to observe the associated k@xmath13 emission .",
    "for the ionization levels suggested by the above fits including an edge ( @xmath99fexx ) the emission line energy should be close to 6.4  kev .",
    "we have tested for the presence of such a line by adding a narrow gaussian line to the model at that energy .",
    "although a significant improvement is not obtained , the equivalent width @xmath105  ev is consistent with the predictions of photoionization models assuming full coverage of the column density implied by the edge fits . if the emission line is broad , as observed in seyfert 1 galaxies , then the upper limit to @xmath106 is larger by a factor @xmath107 .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that both the _ asca _ and _ rosat _ spectra from pg  1114 + 445 are consistent with a single powerlaw continuum with @xmath0 absorbed by a column density of @xmath108 of photoionized gas @xmath51 .",
    "we suggests this offers the most plausible explanation of the the x - ray spectrum of this source , making it only the fifth quasar ( alongside mr  2251 - 178 , 3c  351 , 3c  273 and iras  13349 + 2438 ) in which ionized material has been detected along the line  of  sight . after correcting for absorption ( i.e. setting @xmath109 ) , the x - ray luminosities and @xmath110 are @xmath111 and @xmath112 over the 0.110 kev and 210  kev bands ( source - frame ) respectively",
    "this is comparable to the higher - luminosity examples of the sources considered by g97 .",
    "unfortunately these data do not allow any strong constraints to be placed on the location , or solid angle subtended by the ionized material at the ionizing source .",
    "clearly a comparison between the properties of the material dominating the absorption in the x - ray band of pg  1114 + 445 with that responsible for the absorption features seen in the uv might be revealing . to this end , in table  2 we list the column densities of the abundant li - like ions predicted from our best - fit model from  3.1 .",
    "it should be stressed that such predictions are very sensitive to form of the ionizing continuum in the xuv band , and of course the elemental abundances .",
    "the values quoted in table  2 assume the weak ir continuum described by netzer ( 1996 ) , namely a _",
    "index @xmath113 in the optical / uv band from 1.640.8  ev , an index @xmath114 in the x - ray band from 0.250  kev , and a powerlaw continuum in the xuv band connecting the fluxes at 40.8  ev and 0.2  kev , such that the ratio of the fluxes at 250  nm and 2  kev is @xmath115 ( corresponding to an optical  to  x - ray _ energy _",
    "index @xmath116 ) .",
    "following netzer ( 1996 ) , we assume undepleted cosmic abundances ( with ( he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , fe)/h = ( @xmath117 , 3.7 , 1.1 , 8 , 1.1 , 0.37 , 0.35 , 0.16 , 0.4)/@xmath118 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the column densities in the bound  free transitions in ovii & oviii are @xmath119 & @xmath120 respectively . in passing we note that given the cross - sections for these transitions ( @xmath121 & @xmath122 respectively ) , the predicted optical - depth of ovii ( @xmath123 ) is in good agreement with that obtained in  3.1.1 when the data is modelled as a powerlaw plus ovii & oviii absorption edges . however , the observed optical - depth of oviii ( @xmath124 ) is a factor @xmath92 larger than that predicted in our full photoionization calculations , primarily as a result of the modelled optical - depth of oviii having to include the additional opacity due to fe @xmath42-shell and neix @xmath4-shell transitions during the fitting process .",
    "the parameters for the ionized gas obtained here for pg  1114 + 445 are very similar to those found for seyfert - i galaxies .",
    "g97 find the ionization parameter typically clusters around @xmath125 with column densities in the range @xmath126@xmath127 .",
    "the underlying spectral index also lies in the range found in seyfert - i galaxies .",
    "the underlying continuum could not be determined unambiguously from the _ rosat _ pspc data from the rlq 3c  351 ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) .",
    "however the fits including absorption by ionized material reported by fiore et al ( 1993 ) indicate a similar column density ( @xmath130@xmath131 ) to that found in pg  1114 + 445 and seyfert - is , but that the gas is less ionized ( @xmath132few@xmath133 , after conversion of the quoted ionization parameter to that over the 0.110  kev band used here ) .",
    "nandra et al ( 1997b ) have recently reported the results from _ asca _ observations of the rqq mr  2251 - 178 ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) , obtaining a lower column density ( @xmath136 ) and @xmath137 .",
    "brandt , fabian & pounds ( 1996 ) have found evidence for absorption by ionized oygen in _ rosat _ pspc data from iras  13349 + 2438 ( @xmath138 , @xmath139@xmath140 ) .",
    "unfortunately the properties of the ionized material could not be well constrained by those data ( @xmath141few@xmath142@xmath143 , @xmath144@xmath145 ) . however , the lack of significant absorption by _",
    "neutral _ material in the pspc data along with strong evdience for dust at other wavebands led brandt et al to suggest that the dust may be embedded within the ionized material .    a particularly interesting result of our analysis is the detection of an absorption feature within the fe @xmath4-shell band (  3.2 ) .",
    "the strength of this feature implies either an fe / o abundance ratio @xmath5 times cosmic , or a second zone of highly ionized material , perhaps outflowing from the nucleus .",
    "the feature is of similar energy and depth as those observed in seyfert - i galaxies by _ ginga _ ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) , and that possibly detected in an _ asca _ observation of the rlq s5  0014 + 81 ( cappi et al 1997 ) .",

    "<S> we present results on the x - ray spectrum of the quasar pg  1114 + 445 from an _ asca _ observation performed in 1996 june , and a _ rosat _ observation performed 3 years earlier . </S>",
    "<S> we show good agreement between all the datasets can be obtained if the underlying continuum in the 0.210  kev band is assumed to be a powerlaw ( photon index @xmath0 ) absorbed by photoionized material . </S>",
    "<S> the ionized gas imprints deep absorption edges in the observed spectrum @xmath1  kev due to ovii and oviii , from which we determine its column density ( @xmath2 ) and ionization parameter ( @xmath3 ) to be similar to that observed in seyfert - i galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately these data do not allow any strong constraints to be placed on the location , or solid angle subtended by the material at the ionizing source . </S>",
    "<S> we also find evidence for absorption in the fe @xmath4-shell band in excess of that predicted from the lower energy features . </S>",
    "<S> this implies an fe / o abundance ratio @xmath5 times the cosmic value , or an additional screen of more - highly ionized gas , possibly out - flowing from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly compare our results with those obtained from other active galaxies . </S>"
