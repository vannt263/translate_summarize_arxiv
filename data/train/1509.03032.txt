    "<S> [ hhgscheme ] , a seed laser is used to imprint a periodic energy modulation at the seed wavelength @xmath0 ( typically in the uv ) onto a relativistic electron beam ( e - beam ) in the modulator . this energy modulation is converted into a current density modulation when the e - beam interacts with the magnetic field of the dispersive section . </S>",

    "<S> initially the e - beam is rigid and the fel electric field is directly proportional to the bunching factor in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ bunching_factor ] . in the linear regime ( before saturation ) @xcite , the field envelope is preserved despite amplification in the radiator , as demonstrated in the following . </S>",

    "<S> for the cases considered here it suffices to expand each of the individual phase contributions @xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath14 into a power series in time up to the second order . while a linear - term coefficient @xmath17 results in an absolute frequency ( wavelength ) shift @xcite , a quadratic - term coefficient @xmath18 , called the chirp rate , gives rise to a linear frequency chirp in the pulse @xcite . a suitable seed laser chirp </S>",

    "<S> we experimentally verify the above predictions and demonstrate the power of the hghg scheme in controlling the spectro - temporal content of intense xuv pulses . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ spectra ] a ) shows the experimental spectral map , when the relatively high positive frequency chirp on the fel , dominated by the positive chirp due to a stretched seed , dictates the radiation properties . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use the group delay dispersion ( gdd ) as a measure for the degree of chirp on the seed laser . </S>",
    "<S> the strong linear frequency chirp , characterized by a gdd of 7390 fs@xmath19 , was achieved by putting a 20 mm thick plate of fused silica into the seed laser ( frequency up - converted pulses from an optical parametric amplifier , opa ) path , inducing a positive chirp rate of @xmath20 rad / fs@xmath19 and stretching the seed pulse duration to 250 fs ( fwhm ) , at the operating wavelength of 258 nm . </S>",

    "<S> the negative chirp rate on the seed compensates the positive chirp due to the quadratic curvature ( @xmath31 mev / ps@xmath19 , measured at the end of the linac using a radio - frequency deflecting cavity in combination with an energy spectrometer @xcite ) on the e - beam time - dependent energy profile and the chirp developed during the amplification stage @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , because the phase contribution from the e - beam @xmath16 is a function of @xmath4 , the fel chirp rate varies linearly from about @xmath32 to @xmath33 rad / fs@xmath19 in the range of dispersive strengths used in fig . </S>",

    "<S> several important conclusions can be drawn from the above results . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental spectral maps in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spectra ] and their excellent agreement with theory based on eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ bunching_factor ] and [ fel_phase ] imply that the fel output can be fully manipulated by controlling the seed laser envelope and phase , where the dispersive strength can act as an additional tuning knob ( e.g. , an fel pulse train with a fixed phase relationship between individual pulses is obtained simply by increasing the strength of the dispersive section ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate , to the best of our knowledge , the first compelling evidence that the radiation produced by a seeded fel is temporally fully coherent and that by adjusting the seed laser phase , a controllable amount of linear frequency chirp can be transferred to the fel pulse . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a careful tuning allows generation of fourier limited pulses with a flat temporal phase . </S>",
    "<S> such pulses are typically used as references in the field of coherent quantum control . </S>",
    "<S> our results therefore open the door to full spectro - temporal shaping of intense ultrashort pulses in the xuv to soft - x - ray region using methods similar to the ones developed in the visible spectral region @xcite . in combination with the possibility to engineer the fel transverse radiation profile using hghg @xcite , </S>",
