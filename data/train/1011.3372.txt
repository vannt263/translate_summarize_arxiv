    "the calculation of the decay constants @xmath9 of ground - state heavy pseudoscalar mesons @xmath10 by qcd sum rules @xcite is a complicated problem : first , a reliable operator product expansion ( ope ) for the `` borelized '' correlation function of two pseudoscalar heavy - light currents has to be found .",
    "second , even if all the parameters of this ope are known precisely , the knowledge of only a _ truncated _",
    "ope for the correlator allows to extract bound - state observables with only finite accuracy , reflecting an inherent uncertainty of the qcd sum - rule approach .",
    "controlling this uncertainty constitutes a delicate problem for actual applications @xcite .",
    "recall one essential feature of the sum - rule extractions of decay constants : the quark ",
    "hadron duality assumption entails a ( merely approximate ) relation between hadronic ground - state contribution and ope with the `` qcd - level '' correlator cut at some effective continuum threshold @xmath11:@xmath12here , the perturbative spectral density @xmath13 is obtained as a series expansion in powers of the strong coupling @xmath14:@xmath15obviously , in order to extract a decay constant @xmath16 one has to find a way to fix the effective continuum threshold  @xmath11 .",
    "a crucial albeit very trivial observation is that @xmath11 must be a function of @xmath17 , otherwise the l.h.s .  and",
    "the r.h.s .  of ( [ sr_qcd ] ) would exhibit a different @xmath17-behaviour .",
    "the _ exact effective continuum threshold _  corresponding to the true values of hadron mass and decay constant on the l.h.s .  of ( [ sr_qcd ] )",
    " is , of course , not known .",
    "therefore , our idea of extracting hadron parameters from sum rules consists in attempting ( i ) to find a reliable approximation to the exact threshold @xmath11 and ( ii ) to control the accuracy of this approximation . in a recent series of publications @xcite",
    ", we have constructed all the associated procedures , techniques and algorithms .",
    "we define a dual invariant mass @xmath18 and a dual decay constant @xmath19 ( @xmath20 still denoting the true hadron mass ) by@xmath21 in case the ground - state mass @xmath20 is known , the deviation of the dual ground - state mass @xmath22 from its actual value @xmath20 yields an indication of the excited - state contributions picked up by our dual correlator . assuming some specific functional shape for our effective threshold and requiring least deviation of the dual mass ( [ mdual ] ) from its actual value in the borel window leads to a variational solution for the effective threshold . with @xmath23 at our disposal we get the decay constant from ( [ fdual ] ) .",
    "the standard _",
    "assumption _ for the effective threshold is that it is a ( @xmath17-independent ) constant .",
    "in addition to such crude approximation we also consider polynomials in @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , @xmath17-dependent thresholds greatly facilitate reproducing the actual mass value .",
    "this implies that a dual correlator with @xmath17-dependent threshold isolates the ground state much better and is less contaminated by excited states than a dual correlator with the conventional @xmath17-independent threshold . as consequence",
    ", the accuracies of extracted hadron observables are drastically improved .",
    "recent experience from potential models reveals that the band of values obtained from linear , quadratic , and cubic anstze for the effective threshold encompasses the true value of the decay constant @xcite .",
    "moreover , we could show that the extraction procedures in quantum mechanics and in qcd are even quantitatively very similar @xcite . here",
    ", we report our results @xcite for heavy - meson decay constants .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "applying ( in an attempt to improve the sum - rule method ) our above modifications , we realize several serendipities :    1 .",
    "the @xmath17-dependence of the effective thresholds emerges naturally when one attempts to render the duality relation exact : the dependence is evident from ( [ sr_qcd ] ) .",
    "we emphasize two facts : ( a ) in principle , such dependence on @xmath17 is _ not _ in conflict with any properties of quantum field theories .",
    "( b ) our analysis of @xmath24 mesons shows that it indeed improves _",
    "decisively _ the quality of the related sum - rule predictions .    2 .",
    "our study of _ charmed mesons _ clearly demonstrates that using borel - parameter - dependent thresholds leads to lots of essential improvements : ( i ) the accuracy of decay constants predicted by sum rules is drastically improved .",
    "( ii ) it has become possible to obtain a realistic systematic error and to diminish it to the level of , say , a few percent .",
    "( iii ) our prescription brings qcd sum - rule findings into perfect agreement with both lattice qcd and experiment .",
    "the _ beauty - meson _ decay constants @xmath25 are extremely sensitive to the choice of the @xmath2-quark mass : matching our qcd sum - rule @xmath5 outcome to the corresponding average of lattice computations provides a truly accurate estimate of @xmath4 , in good agreement with several lattice results but , interestingly , not at all overlapping with a recent very accurate determination @xcite ( for details , consult ref .",
