    "let us equip the curve @xmath5 with the counterclockwise orientation and consider the sherman ",

    "* lemma 5.1.4 ) the function @xmath33 is the solution of the boundary value problem .",
    "thus if an exact or an approximate solution of the integral equation is known , a solution of the biharmonic problem can be obtained by using formulas , and .",
    "therefore , the main effort should be directed to the determination of solutions of the sherman - lauricella equation .",
    "note that the nystrm method for the sherman - lauricella equation on smooth contours has been used in @xcite to find approximate solution of biharmonic problems arising in fluid dynamics .",
    "however , the authors of those works have not presented any stability conditions for the method considered .",
    "if @xmath5 has corner points , the stability study becomes more involved since the integral operators in are not compact . for piecewise smooth contours , conditions of the stability of the nystrm method are established in @xcite .",
    "these results have been used in @xcite in order to construct a very accurate numerical method to find solutions of the biharmonic problem in piecewise smooth domains in the case of piecewise continuous boundary conditions .    in the present paper , we consider spline based galerkin methods for the equation and study their stability .",
    "it is shown that the corresponding method is stable if and only if certain operators @xmath34 from an algebra of toeplitz operators are invertible .",
    "these operators depend on the spline space used and on the opening angles of the corner points @xmath35 .",
    "unfortunately , nowadays there is no analytic tool to verify whether the operators in question are invertible or not .",
    "nevertheless , we propose a numerical approach which can handle this problem .",
    "thus spline galerkin methods are applied to the sherman ",
    "lauricella equation on simple model curves and the behaviour of the corresponding approximation operators provide an information about the invertibility of the operators @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "note that in comparison to the nystrm method , the implementation of spline galerkin methods to solve the sherman ",
    "lauricella equation , requires more preparatory work .",
    "on the other hand , numerical experiments suggest that these methods have no `` critical '' angles located in the interval @xmath36 $ ] , i.e. if the boundary @xmath5 does not possess corners with opening angles from the interval mentioned , then these methods are stable . in a sense , this is similar to the behaviour of the corresponding approximation methods for sherman  lauricella and muskhelishvili equations in the case of smooth curves which always converge @xcite .",
    "of course , one also has to study the opening angles in the intervals @xmath37 and to @xmath38 but this is a time consuming operation and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "we start this section with the construction of spline spaces on the contour @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath39 be a @xmath2-periodic parametrization of @xmath5 , and let @xmath40 denote the set of all corner points @xmath41 of @xmath5 .",
    "without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , we also suppose that the function @xmath44 is two times continuously differentiable on each interval @xmath45 and @xmath46 note that the last condition is not very restrictive and can always be satisfied by changing the parametrization of @xmath5 in an appropriate way .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath47 be functions defined on the real line @xmath19 , and let @xmath48 denote the convolution @xmath49 of @xmath15 and @xmath47 . if @xmath50 is the characteristic function of the interval @xmath51 , @xmath52 then @xmath53 refers to the function defined by @xmath54 recall that for any given non - negative integer @xmath55 , the function @xmath56 generates spline spaces on @xmath19 .",
    "thus if an @xmath57 is fixed , then closure in the @xmath58-norm of the set of all finite linear combinations of the functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 constitutes a spline space on @xmath19 .    using the above defined spline functions",
    ", one can introduce spline spaces on the contour @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , for a fixed non - negative integer @xmath55 and an @xmath61 , @xmath62 , we denote by @xmath63 the set of all linear combinations of the functions @xmath64 the support of which belongs entirely to one of the arcs @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this definition is correct since the support @xmath68 of the function @xmath56 is contained in the interval @xmath69 $ ] @xcite and @xmath44 is a @xmath2-periodic function .    in what follows ,",
    "we also consider operators acting on various subspaces of the hilbert space @xmath70 of all sequences @xmath71 of complex numbers @xmath72 satisfying the condition @xmath73 the space @xmath74 is closely connected to spline spaces on the real line @xmath19 .",
    "thus the following result is true .",
    "[ l1 ] let @xmath57",

    "it is well known that the operator @xmath82 is not invertible on the space @xmath79 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the invertibility of the corresponding operator is a necessary condition for the applicability of any galerkin method to any operator equation .",
    "therefore , for approximate solution of the equation we use the equation with the operator @xmath83 instead of @xmath84 and chose the right - hand sides @xmath15 of the initial equation from a suitable subspace of @xmath79 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath85 denote the closure of the set of all functions @xmath15 with bounded derivatives in the norm @xmath86 and let @xmath87 refer to the operator defined by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a point in @xmath4 .",
    "[ t1 ] if @xmath5 is a simple closed piecewise smooth contour , then operator @xmath90 is invertible on the space @xmath91 . moreover ,",
    "if function @xmath92 satisfies the condition , then the solution of the equation @xmath93 belongs to the space @xmath94 and is a solution of the original sherman - lauricella equation .",
    "thus if the right hand sides @xmath92 , the corrected sherman - lauricella equation can be used in order to find an exact or an approximate solution of the equation . in the present paper",
    ", we employ spline based galerkin methods to the equation and study their stability and convergence .",
    "let us describe these methods in more detail .",
    "first of all , we normalize all the basis spline functions used .",
    "if @xmath95 is fixed , then for any @xmath96 the norm @xmath97 of any basis element @xmath98 is @xmath99 therefore , if @xmath100 refers to the number @xmath101 then @xmath102 are unit norm vectors",
    ". an approximate solution of the equation is sought in the form @xmath103 the coefficients @xmath104 of which are obtained from the following system of algebraic equations @xmath105 an important problem now is to study the solvability of the equations and convergence of the approximate solutions to an exact solution of the original sherman  lauricella equation . in section [ s3 ] , this problem is discussed in a more detail but , at the moment , we would like to illustrate the method under consideration by a few numerical examples .",
    "thus we present galerkin solutions of the equation with the right - hand side @xmath106 , @xmath107 on the unite square and rhombuses , and trace the evolution of the solution when the initial contour is transformed from the unit square into rhombuses with various opening angle @xmath108 .",
    "some of these contours have been used in @xcite in order to illustrate the behaviour of the nystrm method . note that in the corresponding examples from @xcite , approximate solutions of the equation with the right - hand side @xmath109 have been determined .",
    "we apply the spline galerkin method to the equations with such right - hand side , too .",
    "the results obtained have a very good correlation with @xcite and the error evaluation for both cases are reported in table [ table1 ] , where @xmath110 denotes the relative error @xmath111 computed for the righthand side @xmath112 and equation is considered on the rhombus with the opening angle @xmath108 .",
