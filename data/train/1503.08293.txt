    "bimno@xmath0 is the only strong ferromagnetic insulator among the transition - metal perovskite oxides , a family of functional materials whose members display many different properties of technological interest .",
    "the curie temperature of bimno@xmath0 is around 105  k,@xcite below which several groups have reported measurements of its magnetic moment close to 4  @xmath3 per mn atom.@xcite the unique ferromagnetic behaviour of bimno@xmath0 is related to the presence of orbital ordering of the mn@xmath4 ions ( 3@xmath5)elongated half - filled @xmath6 orbitals point towards empty @xmath7 orbitals of neighboring mn cations.@xcite for many years bimno@xmath0 was supposed to have also a weak switchable polarization ( below 0.1  @xmath8/@xmath2 ) , and the polar space group @xmath9 was assigned to its crystal structure.@xcite however , recent electron diffraction experiments by belik and coworkers@xcite point to a @xmath10 space group , which is not polar ; these results have been confirmed by neutron powder diffraction experiments.@xcite despite of this , when bimno@xmath0 is grown as a epitaxial film on srtio@xmath0 it develops a strong polarization , which jeen and coworkers@xcite measured to be 23  @xmath8/@xmath2 ; other groups reported similar results ",
    "a polarization between 9 and 16  @xmath8/@xmath2,@xcite and signatures of ferroelectricity.@xcite    perovskite oxides display dramatic changes in their properties when grown as epitaxial films on a substrate , with the misfit strain imposed by the substrate playing a major role in these changes.@xcite given that other nonpolar perovskites develop ferroelectricity under epitaxial strain , it is somewhat surprising that the epitaxial phase diagram of bimno@xmath0 is largely unexplored in the search for possible coexistence of magnetic and polar orderings . using first - principles calculations ,",
    "hatt and spaldin@xcite concluded that bimno@xmath0 remains non - polar when compressive or tensile strain is applied to the film ; they used the @xmath10 bulk phase as the starting point of their calculations , subjecting the simulation cell to constraints that mimic the strained film .",
    "no other phases seem to have been studied using computational approaches , although earlier calculations by hill and rabe@xcite and by seshadri and hill@xcite pointed to the existence of ferroelectric instabilities in this material . in this study",
    "we explore structures that are good candidates to become the ground state of epitaxial bimno@xmath0 films . at high compressive strains ,",
    "we have looked at the supertetragonal phases with giant polarization that are found in bifeo@xmath0 films@xcite and in bicoo@xmath0 bulk and films;@xcite these phases are called supertetragonal , or @xmath11 , because they have a large @xmath12 ratio ( some of them have lower symmetry than tetragonal ) . at high tensile strains , we have explored phases of low energy in bifeo@xmath0 ( including the @xmath13 structure of both bulk bifeo@xmath0 and bulk bimno@xmath0 under pressure@xcite and epitaxial polar phases of bifeo@xmath0 under tensile strains ) .",
    "we have found that bimno@xmath0 and bifeo@xmath0 films display similar structures under high tensile and compressive strains ; therefore , we predict that bimno@xmath0 has a strong polarization when grown in these conditions .",
    "our first - principles calculations are based on density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite however , bimno@xmath0 contains highly localized @xmath14 orbitals that are not described accurately within pure dft .",
    "one approach towards a better description of the electronic properties of these solids is to add a `` hubbard @xmath15 '' term to the energy of the system that favors localization on those electrons ; this requires picking a value of @xmath15 that reproduces some set of experimental or more accurate theory results .",
    "another approach is to use a hybrid density functional that includes a portion of exact hartree - fock exchange;@xcite this in general ameliorates the problems with @xmath14 or @xmath16 electron delocalization , predicts band gaps for solids that are much closer to experimental results than those of pure dft,@xcite and performs better than the `` hubbard @xmath15 '' approach in perovskite oxides such as bifeo@xmath0.@xcite both approaches are implemented in vasp,@xcite the first - principles code that we have used to carry out the calculations presented in this work . to optimize our typical structures with vasp",
    "the second approach requires a hundred times more computer time than the first one , so we have used the code in the following way : for our exploratory calculations we applied a hubbard @xmath15 following the rotationally invariant method described in ref .  , and",
    "for our final results we used a hybrid functional according to the hse06 prescription.@xcite as in our previous article on bifeo@xmath0,@xcite we worked with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof dft exchange - correlation functional adapted to solids ( pbesol).@xcite we used the projector augmented - wave method to represent the ionic cores,@xcite solving for the following electrons : mn s @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ; bi s @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ; and o s @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we represented wave functions in a plane - wave basis set truncated at 500 ev .",
    "we performed integrations within the brillouin zone by using @xmath25-point grids with densities similar to that of a @xmath26 grid for a 5-atom perovskite unit cell .",
    "we started our search for metastable phases of bimno@xmath0 by doing pbesol+@xmath15 ionic relaxations for the seven lowest - energy crystal structures found for bulk bifeo@xmath0 in our previous work@xcite ( which can accommodate to a @xmath27 pseudocubic 40-atom cell ) and for the experimental @xmath10 ground state configuration of bimno@xmath0 ( using 40-atom cells that are not pseudocubic ) .",
    "for each of these eight configurations we prepared four types of magnetic arrangments , as in ref .",
    "ferromagnetic ( fm ) , and antiferromagnetic of the a , c , and g types ( a - afm , c - afm , g - afm , respectively ) .",
    "we then did three types of searches for local minima of the energy : ( 1 ) we directly relaxed the structures until forces and stresses were close to zero ; ( 2 ) we did a few steps of molecular dynamics in order to break possible spureous symmetries , and then we relaxed the resulting structures until forces and stresses were close to zero ; and ( 3 ) we took the lowest - energy magnetic ordering found so far for each structure type and relaxed the atoms imposing each of the other three magnetic orderings . at the end , we chose the lowest - energy phase for each type of structure found and for each type of magnetic ordering .",
    "in all the optimization calculations of this work the final forces were below 0.015  ev /   and the final stresses are below 0.0005  ev / @xmath28 .",
    "the process just described lead to the identification of the configurations whose energies are given in fig .",
    "[ fig_energies ] ( top ) .",
    "the corresponding phases are labeled in the following way ( directions are given in the pseudocubic setting ) : the ground state with @xmath10 symmetry is labeled as gs ; the paraelectric phase with @xmath13 symmetry is labeled as @xmath29 ; the ferroelectric phase derived from the @xmath30 phase that is the ground state of bifeo@xmath0 is labeled as @xmath31 ( since mn@xmath4 is a @xmath5 jahn - teller active ion , the original @xmath30 phase distorts into this one , which has a polarization with a component along @xmath32 $ ] and another one along @xmath33 $ ] , corresponding to the @xmath34 monoclinic space group ) ; the other phases are supertetragonal @xmath11 phases like the ones mentioned earlier .",
    "three of these @xmath11 phases are local minima of the energy according to our analysis of the corresponding force - constant matrices : @xmath35 ( originating from the @xmath34 phase , with a small component of the polarization along @xmath32 $ ] and a large one along @xmath33 $ ] ) , @xmath36 ( originating from the @xmath37 phase , with polarization along @xmath33 $ ] ) , and @xmath38 ( originating from the @xmath39 phase , with a small component of the polarization along @xmath32 $ ] and a large one along @xmath33 $ ] ) .",

    ", width=283 ]    the calculations mentioned in the previous paragraph were done using @xmath45  ev and @xmath46  ev , since these values gave good agreement between the structural parameters computed for the bulk ground state and the experimental results ; however , the obtained band gap was close to zero , and reasonable variations of @xmath15 and @xmath47 could not get the band gap to open above 0.5  ev ( the experimental gap of fm bimno@xmath0 is 0.9 ev,@xcite but it is expected to be larger for antiferromagnetic configurations ) . because of this failure to open band gaps , in many cases when optimizing fm structures we would get a spureous metallic state ; this is the reason why in fig .",
    "[ fig_energies ] ( top ) many of the fm states are absent .",
    "another spureous result obtained when using pbesol+@xmath15 is that the experimental ground state of bimno@xmath0 is predicted to have higher energy than the @xmath29 phases .",

    "this is in line with the previous finding for bifeo@xmath0 in which we reported that energy differences between _ similar _ structures are independent of the exchange - correlation functional used due to error cancelation.@xcite in particular , pbesol+@xmath15 and hse06 predict very similar energy differences between different magnetic arrangements of the same structure ; this is why we have not recomputed other magnetic orderings of the gs phase ( some of them require to double the unit cell , making these calculations computationally expensive ) . for each of the geometries that are local minima of the energy , tables  [ tab_bulk ] and [ tab_bulkwickoff ] list in detail the properties of the structure having the favored magnetic ordering ;",

    "figure  [ fig_films ] shows how the properties of these films change with the in - plane lattice constant . at lattice constants around 3.90    the epitaxial distortion on the gs film breaks the @xmath10 symmetry , but it is otherwise very small , so the corresponding film is still the favored one . as we compress the film , the @xmath35 phase becomes competitive , and below around 3.75    it is expected to be the stable state of the material . for tensile strains at in - plane lattice parameters above 4    we expect the @xmath31 film to be the ground state , displaying a large polarization with components both in plane and out of plane .",

    "the supertetragonal phase that we have found is very similar to that of bifeo@xmath0 films grown on laalo@xmath0@xcite ( @xmath67   ) and of bicoo@xmath0 , where it is the ground state even in bulk ( @xmath68  @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of phases with giant polarization might be ubiquitous in transition - metal perovskite oxides containing bismuth , whose lone electron pair can be easily accommodated in this kind of structures;@xcite note that previous calculations for bisco@xmath0@xcite provide a hint that this might be yet another material displaying the same behaviour . since bimno@xmath0 is the only strong ferromagnet among the insulating transition - metal perovskite oxides , our results are also relevant in the context of discovery of new multiferroics ; we have found that a - afm ordering is energetically favored , but the fm ordering is competitive ( especially for the @xmath31 phase ) .",
    "it might thus be possible to engineer ferroelectric ferromagnets by combining these new film phases of bimno@xmath0 with other transition - metals oxides in superlattices or solid solutions . finally , in addition to this functional properties , some of these phases of bimno@xmath0 show band gaps that are smaller than those found typically in perovskite oxides , which makes this material interesting also from the point of view of photovoltaic applications .",
