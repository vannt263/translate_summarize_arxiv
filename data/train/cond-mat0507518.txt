    "the transport of electrons through a quantum dot ( qd ) is a subject of increasing interest for its many applications in nanotechnology .",
    "although there exists exact solutions for the ground state of the qd connected to metallic leads @xcite , no such methods are applicable to nonequilibrium systems .",
    "typical cases are those of ( a ) a bias or ( b ) an electromagnetic radiation between the leads of a quantum well @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that , in case ( a ) , two kondo resonances appear , each one associated with every lead @xcite,@xcite . some experimental evidence has been presented supporting this view @xcite .",
    "still , it is not well understood how inelastic ( decoherent ) processes modify the strong - coupling regime associated with the kondo resonance . to our knowledge",
    ", there are only a few theoretical approaches to the problem . the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite,@xcite ,",
    "being essentially numerical , can give analytical results only in the limit @xmath3 ( v being the applied bias and @xmath4 the kondo energy ) , the same limit in which renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt ) @xcite,@xcite is valid .",
    "it is important , however , to have analytical results for the decoherence rate , not only to make theoretical predictions , but also to be able to interpret correctly the results of calculations done for more complicated situations , i.e. , when time- dependent potentials are applied to the qd @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a version of the nonequilibrium kondo problem has been solved exactly to all orders in the applied bias v in @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we address the nonequilibrium kondo problem for a qd in the limit of infinite coulomb repulsion u , using an equation of motion ( eom ) method based on a slave - boson hamiltonian . by means of a strict perturbative solution in the leads - dot coupling , @xmath0 , to orders @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "we have been able to identify the decoherent processes that broaden the kondo - level , as a function of the applied bias , and break the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the eom method has been applied before to the kondo problem @xcite but it was mainly used with approximations valid only for high temperatures @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we show that this method , when applied consistently to high orders , can be conveniently used in the nonequilibrium case , describing well the inelastic processes contributing to the kondo resonance decoherence .",
    "we first check the method in the equilibrium regime , comparing our results with exact results using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) and also with the nca .",
    "when used in the nonequilibrium case , we find that , for an applied bias larger than @xmath5 , the system develops two - peaked resonant structures at @xmath6 ; we show , however , that decoherent processes take the system from the strong - coupling regime , where the spin of the impurity is quenched by the lead electrons , to the weak - coupling regime , if @xmath7 is larger than a few units .",
    "we conclude that our method provides an accurate and powerful tool to analyze nonequilibrium systems and time - dependent problems , situations where very few theoretical approaches are valid .",
    "our starting point for a qd level with infinite - u , coupled to two leads , is the slave - boson hamiltonian for spin up and down electrons @xcite :",
    "@xmath8    where the operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 are introduced in terms of an auxiliary boson field , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for left and right leads . in eq.([ham ] ) , the operator @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) creates ( anhilates ) an electron of momentum @xmath18 and spin @xmath19 in one of the leads , while @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) creates ( anhilates ) an electron of spin @xmath19 in the dot .",
    "the constraint relation    @xmath22    is imposed to guarantee that no more than one electron occupies the qd since we are in the infinite - u limit .",
    "the physical ( retarded ) green function for this problem is defined as @xcite,@xcite @xmath23 and its fourier transform is written as @xmath24 .",
    "the eom for this green function reads ( omitting the argument @xmath25 in all the green functions ) :    @xmath26    where the new green functions appearing on the right - hand side of eq.([chiw ] ) are defined as in eq.([chi ] ) .",
    "@xmath27 is the number operator for electrons of spin @xmath28 in the qd and @xmath29 will denote the expectation value of @xmath30 from now on . in a second step ,",
    "the eom for these green functions lead to a second generation of green functions , viz .",
    ",    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    note that the second generation of green functions involve the excitation of two electrons in the leads . in our approximation to @xmath34 , we contract operators @xmath17 , @xmath35 , where possible and obtain a closed equation for @xmath36 . in particular we take @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this yields the following approximation to @xmath36 , which is exact to @xmath34 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath39    where    @xmath40    we can obtain @xmath36 to @xmath41 by making all possible contractions of operators @xmath17 , @xmath35 in a third generation of green functions . for instance , the eom for @xmath42 in eq.([2c ] ) is : @xmath43 which is approximated by    @xmath44    this procedure yields the green functions already obtained in eqs.([2a]-[2c ] ) and a new one , @xmath45 , which has to be calculated as in eq.([2c ] ) .",
    "the first generation of green functions are thus obtained as :    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    with @xmath49 from now on .",
    "eqs.([3a]-[3c ] ) define a set of coupled integral equations in the energy levels of the leads , @xmath50 , whose solution yields the green functions to be introduced in eq.([chiw ] ) . in these equations",
    "we have neglected expectation values of operators such as @xmath51 , which give small contributions to @xmath36 to @xmath41 and have defined several self - energies given by :    @xmath52 \\label{sigmai}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "these self - energies are associated with different green functions and play a crutial role in the kondo - resonance decoherence , as we will see below .",
    "eqs.([3a]-[3c ] ) reproduce the conventional @xmath57-approximation of @xcite by neglecting all the terms proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "one can get , however , a new ( and effective ) @xmath57-order near the kondo resonance by neglecting the terms that couple these equations in an integral way .",
    "this approximation yields the following green function :    @xmath59 \\nonumber \\\\   & & [ \\omega-\\epsilon_0-\\sigma_0-\\sum_k{t_k^2",
    "< \\hat{n}_k > \\over \\tilde\\omega_k-\\sigma_1(\\tilde\\omega_k)}+ \\sum_k{t_k^2 < \\hat{n}_k > \\sigma_3(\\tilde\\omega_k ) \\over ( \\tilde\\omega_k-\\sigma_2(\\tilde\\omega_k ) ) ( \\tilde\\omega_k-\\sigma_4(\\tilde\\omega_k))}]^{-1 } \\label{v4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath60    in eq.([v4 ] ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 have to be calculated self - consistently @xcite,@xcite . at zero temperature and in a wide - band approximation ,",
    "they are given by :    @xmath63    and @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the fermi level .",
    "in this section we first discuss some consequences that our approximation bears in the description of the kondo peak . notice that the @xmath57-order of eq.([v2 ] ) is given by eq.([v4 ] ) neglecting the last terms of the numerator and denominator and taking @xmath66 .",
    "these new terms yield , however , contributions that are proportional to @xmath57 around the kondo peak .",
    "this can be seen by considering the self - energies @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , whose imaginary parts tend to broaden the kondo - like peak associated with the factors @xmath70 . in the @xmath1-order , eq.([sigmai ] ) yields , for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 being the one - electron level - width ) and a wide - band approximation , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , if @xmath78 .",
    "then , near the fermi level , we obtain : @xmath79 d being the half - bandwidth , and    @xmath80    the important point is that the term given by eq.([new ] ) , which is neglected in the @xmath57-order approximation , also gives a @xmath57-contribution to @xmath36 going like @xmath81 at the fermi energy . in particular , eq.([v4 ] ) yields the kondo - energy    @xmath82 \\label{wkondo}\\ ] ]    intermediate between @xmath83 $ ] ( the @xmath57-order ) and the exact result of haldane @xmath84 $ ] @xcite .    a check of our solution , eq.([v4 ] ) , can be obtained by considering the case @xmath71 ; this equilibrium case can be compared with the nca and with the numerically exact calculations of ref.@xcite using the nrg .",
    "fig.1 shows our calculated spectral density for the kondo regime defined by @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 at zero temperature .",
    "two cases , @xmath57-order and eq.([v4 ] ) are shown as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "although for this particular case our value of @xmath89 , eq.([wkondo ] ) , is very similar to haldane s , we use this last one from now on .",
    "our results indicate that eq.([v4 ] ) yields a much better spectral density for the kondo - resonance than the @xmath57-order aproximation , with values very similar to the ones given by the nrg above the fermi energy , although our results yield a too small value of the spectral density below the fermi energy ; this deviation extends to energies of around @xmath5 and suggests that a much more accurate solution is going to be obtained for voltages larger than this value ( see below ) .",
    "fig.2 shows the same results for a mixed - valence regime ( @xmath90 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) at zero temperature . in this case ,",
    "eq.([v4 ] ) yields an excellent approximation to the exact nrg - calculation and the friedel - langreth sum rule is satisfied with an accuracy better than 10@xmath91 .",
    "the agreement is even better in the empty orbital regime , fig.3 , where the sum rule is fulfilled to within 5@xmath91 accuracy .",
    "we should mention that our present results are in much better agreement with the exact results than the ones obtained using lacroix s approximation @xcite and shown in @xcite .",
    "now we turn our attention to the nonequilibrium case @xmath92 in the symmetric situation , where the chemical potentials of the left and right leads are @xmath6 . a fully consistent solution of the case @xmath92 requires the application of the keldysh formalism , as explained in @xcite .",
    "the symmetric case can be analyzed , however , at the level of the above equations because , to good accuracy , @xmath61 and @xmath62 do not vary with v for the values used here .",
    "we start by analyzing the self - energies @xmath67 and @xmath69 in the regime @xmath93 , which is the relevant regime for analyzing the kondo - resonance decoherence .",
    "it is easy to see that eq.([sigmai ] ) produces @xmath94 , as in the equilibrium case and therefore , we find no decoherence for @xmath92 .",
    "it is interesting to proceed further with the eom method and see how these self - energies are modified . by going to @xmath95 ,",
    "we find for @xmath67 and @xmath68 :    @xmath96 +   \\nonumber \\\\ 2 \\sum_{k',k '' } { t_{k'}^2 ( 1-<\\hat n_{k ' } > ) \\over \\tilde\\omega_k-\\epsilon_{k'}+ \\epsilon_{-}(k')+i\\delta } { 1 \\over \\tilde\\omega_k+\\epsilon_{k''}-\\epsilon_{k ' } } { t_{k''}^2 ( 1-<\\hat n_{k '' } > ) \\over \\tilde\\omega_k+\\epsilon_{k''}- \\epsilon_{+}(k'')+i\\delta}+ \\nonumber \\\\ \\sum_{k',k'',q } { t_{k'}^2 ( 1-<\\hat n_{k ' } > ) \\over \\tilde\\omega_k-\\epsilon_{k'}+ \\epsilon_{-}(k')+i\\delta } { 1 \\over \\tilde\\omega_k+\\epsilon_{k''}-\\epsilon_{k ' } } { t_{k''}^2 ( 1-<\\hat n_{k '' } > ) \\over \\tilde\\omega_k+\\epsilon_{k''}- \\epsilon_{+}(k'')+i\\delta}\\times \\nonumber \\\\ { 1 \\over \\tilde\\omega_k+\\epsilon_{k''}-\\epsilon_{q } } { t_{q}^2 ( 1-<\\hat n_{q } > ) \\over \\tilde\\omega_k-\\epsilon_{q}+ \\epsilon_{-}(q)+i\\delta } + o(t^8 ) \\label{sigma1 - 4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath97 + \\nonumber \\\\ 2 \\sum_{k',k '' } { t_{k'}^2 < \\hat n_{k'}>\\over \\tilde\\omega_k-\\epsilon_{k'}+ \\epsilon_{-}(k')+i\\delta}\\times { 1 \\over \\tilde\\omega_k+\\epsilon_{k''}-\\epsilon_{k'}}\\times { t_{k''}^2 < \\hat n_{k '' } > \\over \\tilde\\omega_k+\\epsilon_{k''}- \\epsilon_{+}(k'')+i\\delta}+ o(t^8 ) \\label{sigma2 - 4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 .",
    "we also get @xmath99 , @xmath100 , as before .",
    "these higher order self - energies give rise to the first non - zero contribution to the kondo resonance decoherence , due to the cross terms between the right and left leads , as has already been pointed out in @xcite . eqs.([sigma1 - 4 ] ) and ( [ sigma2 - 4 ] ) represents the first terms of an expansion for @xmath67 or @xmath68 , using @xmath101 as the expansion parameter , and allows us to analyze the kondo resonance decoherence as a function of an external bias .",
    "for @xmath71 , we again find @xmath94 and @xmath102 but for @xmath92 these self - energies develop non - negligible imaginary parts for @xmath103 . in the bias regime , defined by @xmath104 ,",
    "we find    @xmath105    and @xmath106 . in eq.([sigmav ] ) , @xmath107 is a renormalized level given approximately by @xmath108 .",
    "fig.4 shows the evolution of the kondo - like resonance spectral density for the same parameters used in fig.1 , but introducing different biases on the qd .",
    "here we have used eq.([v4 ] ) and the self - energies to @xmath2-order .",
    "our results are compared with the nca - calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , where available .",
    "the agreement between both approaches , for @xmath109 , is remarkable .",
    "the difference between both cases can be attributed to the bandwidth used in @xcite , which is ten times smaller than ours . for @xmath110 , however , the agreement is only reasonable at low bias ( like in the equilibrium case shown in fig.1 ) , which improves as @xmath111 increases .",
    "we have also calculated the qd - conductance which , in the symmetric configuration we are considering , is basically proportional to the mean value of the spectral density in the interval @xmath112 .",
    "fig.5 shows the conductance @xmath113 in units of the conductance quantum @xmath114 , as a function of @xmath7 ; a good fit is obtained by the expression :    @xmath115    for large values of @xmath7 .",
    "these values also show good agreement with the nca - calculations of @xcite for @xmath116 , where our solution can be taken with great confidence , although in this case , @xmath117 behaves like @xmath118 for very high voltages , @xmath119 .",
    "in addition , we have also addressed the important issue of strong versus weak coupling regimes , as a function of the bias .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the strong - coupling regime might subsist , even for high bias ( @xmath120 ) , if the decoherence rate @xmath121 is smaller than @xmath122 . with @xmath121 given by eq.([sigmav ] ) , the strong - coupling regime is obtained for @xmath123 .",
    "this is a very stringent condition ; for instance , for the values of the parameters in figs.1a and 2 , we find strong coupling for @xmath124 , for which the conductance is larger than @xmath125 .",
    "we conclude that , when subjected to an external bias @xmath126 , the qd - kondo resonance develops a two - peaked structure at @xmath6 for @xmath127 ; the system , however , evolves quickly as a function of the voltage , moving from a strong - coupling regime with the spin impurity screened by the electrons of the leads , to a weak - coupling regime with that spin unscreened .",
    "the eom method provides an accurate approximation to the kondo problem in and out of equilibrium situations , the only requirement being to include all the green functions in a strict expansion in @xmath57 .",
    "our results to @xmath1-order in equilibrium provide a good description of the kondo peak in the kondo regime and an excellent aproximation to ( numerically ) exact results in the mixed - valence and empty - orbital regimes . in the nonequilibrium regime",
    ", it is necessary to carry the method to @xmath95 to find the kondo resonance decoherence , since it involves the coupling between the right and left electrodes through the qd . in particular , in our approach , the decoherence rate is found analytically to be nearly proportional to @xmath111 , which indicates that the system is driven readily to the weak couping regime if @xmath128 , with the spin impurity unquenched by the electrons of the leads .",
