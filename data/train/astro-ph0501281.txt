    "in chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 , hereafter ct95 ) , a two component advective flow ( tcaf ) solution was introduced ( see , chakrabarti , this volume ) .",
    "the sub - keplerian flow has a steady shock but depending on the flow parameters it could be oscillating or propagating .",
    "the post - shock region is called centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer or cenbol . given that the accretion flow largely passes through this shock , it is likely that the hot electrons may be _ accelerated _ by the shock just as high energy cosmic rays are produced by the transient super - novae shocks ( bell 1978ab , longair 1981 ) .",
    "we assume this process in computing the spectra and show that the presence of shocks make their mark distinctly .",
    "our solution also produces gamma - rays naturally since shocks are generally produced due to the centrifugal barrier ( e.g. , chakrabarti , 1996 ) .",
    "it is possible that occasionally an additional source of high energy photons , perhaps in the form of shocks in outflows and jets , is necessary to explain the complete spectra .",
    "details of our model are presented in mandal & chakrabarti ( 2004 ) .",
    "protons loss energy through coulomb interaction and inverse bremss -trahlung .",
    "electrons are heated through this coulomb coupling .",
    "electrons are cooled by bremsstrahlung , cyclo - synchrotron and comptonization of the soft photons due to cyclo - synchrotron radiation .",
    "the comptonization is computed by using this cooling term augmented by the enhancement factor . in the present situation",
    ", the flow passes through the shocks and thus the electrons will have a power - law distribution thus , both the thermal and the non - thermal electrons are present .    the geometry of the flow is chosen to be conical for simplicity and the flow surface makes an angle @xmath0 with the z - axis .",
    "we assumed the form of infall velocity @xmath1 . at the shock , @xmath2",
    ", the velocity is reduced by a factor @xmath3 , the compression ratio , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "the number density also goes up by a factor @xmath3 .    as for the initial conditions , we fix the outer boundary at a large distance ( say , @xmath5 ) and supply matter ( both electrons and protons ) with the same temperature ( say , @xmath6k ) . by integrating energy equation",
    ", we obtained the temperature .",
    "the radiation emitted by the flow through bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation are inverse comptonized by the hot electrons in the flow .",
    "a shock of compression ratio @xmath3 causes the formation of power - law electrons of slope ( bell , 1978ab ) , @xmath7 .",
    "this power - law electrons produce a power - law synchrotron emission with an index ( longair , 1981 ) @xmath8 .",
    "the power - law electrons have energy minimum at @xmath9 and energy maximum at @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is obtained self - consistently by conserving the number of power - law electrons and by computing the number of scatterings that the electrons undergo inside the disk before they escape and @xmath12 is obtained from the temperature of the injected electrons .",
    "this temperature is obtained self - consistently through our integration procedure .    in presence of magnetic field (",
    "assumed to be the ratio of the magnetic energy density to gravitational energy density ) , the pre - shock flow and the cenbol would emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "we assume that the number of black body photons generated by the electrons obeying power - law distribution ( assumed to be of constant fraction @xmath13 of thermal electrons ) below self - absorption frequency is the same fraction @xmath13 of the total black body photons .",
    "we followed the procedures presented in ct95 and titarchuk & lyubarskij ( 1995 ) while computing the comptonized spectrum due to scattering from thermal electrons and power - law electrons .",
    "however , unlike ct95 where a keplerian disk was supplying soft photons , here the source is everywhere , i.e. , distributed throughout .",
    "this has been taken into account . at the end",
    ", we add contributions from all the components to get the net photon emission from the flow .    in the next section",
    ", we present the spectral characteristics by varying parameters such as @xmath0 , @xmath14 , @xmath3 , @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "we use a black hole of mass @xmath16 .",
    "in fig . 1 we show our simplified flow geometry to capture the essential physics and show how the temperature of the electrons and protons differ as the flow moves closer to the black hole .",
    "the deviation is more prominent in the post - shock region . here",
    ", the radial distance @xmath17 is measured in units of the schwarzschild radius @xmath18 .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show a typical spectrum obtained from our solution .",
    "the curve marked 1 is due to pre - shock flow and the curve marked 2 is due to the post - shock flow .",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption frequency at @xmath19 is marked .",
    "the bump due to post - shock flow is at frequency @xmath20^{x_{\\rm s}^{1/2}}$ ] , where , @xmath21 is the frequency of the dominant photons from the pre - shock flow , @xmath3 is the compression ratio of the shock located at @xmath14 .",
    "the power law is produced by the power - law electrons from the shock acceleration .    in fig .",
    "3 , we compare three cases with shock locations at @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the shock locations can vary with specific angular momentum in the flow which in turn is governed by the viscosity parameter ( chakrabarti , 1990 ; 1996 ) .    with the rise in the accretion rate of the sub - keplerian disk , the spectrum is likely to become harder .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in fig .",
    "4 , where we vary the accretion rate .",
    "a higher accretion rate is expected to increase the density of the flow and it becomes difficult to cool the matter by the soft photons of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the comptonized spectrum becomes harder . at lower accretion rate ,",
    "it is easy to cool the flow and the spectrum becomes softer .",
    "the curves are drawn for : @xmath24 ( solid ) , @xmath25 ( dotted ) and @xmath26 ( dashed ) .",
    "typical broad band soft state and hard state spectra are presented in fig .",
    "4 of chakrabarti ( this volume ) . in fig . 5 of chakrabarti",
    "( this volume ) behaviour at high energy has been shown for cyg x-1 , groj1719 - 24 and groj0422 + 32 ( taken from ling & wheaton , 2004 ) . in fig .",
    "5 we present the photon flux in soft and hard states as obtained by our solution with shocks . no jet contribution was added .",
    "not surprisingly , they look similar .",
    "however , a second kind of high @xmath27 intensity state was reported ( see , case et al .",
    "2004 ) in which non - thermal power - law has been observed from a few tens of kev to few mevs ( see , fig .",
    "4 of chakrabarti , this volume ) .",
    "it has been difficult to obtain such a behaviour without invoking jets or other mechanisms ."
