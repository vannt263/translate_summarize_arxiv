    "the first solar neutrino experiment , the cl - ar radiochemical detector @xcite built by ray davis , jr . and his colleagues , provided the only direct information about solar neutrinos in the seemingly endless interval between 1968 and 1988 . towards the end of that period",
    "the kamiokande proton - decay detector was being outfitted with new electronics in order to lower the threshold sufficiently to see the neutrinos from @xmath2b decay in the sun , which it did in 1989 @xcite .",
    "that period also saw initiation by vladimir gavrin s group in the soviet union at the newly built baksan laboratory of a gallium radiochemical experiment , ` sage ' , to see if the @xmath3 neutrinos were really there .",
    "a similarly motivated effort in the us was abortive , and till kirsten launched the gallex experiment with a mainly european team at gran sasso .",
    "the `` standard solar model '' ( ssm ) constructed by bahcall @xcite predicted that ga experiments should see a neutrino capture rate of 136 snu ( captures per @xmath4 target atoms per second ) . a rate above 69 snu was thought to be indicative of errors in the ssm , while a smaller rate would require new neutrino physics .",
    "that division , based on the rate in ga of the @xmath3 reaction by itself , today seems naive , and with much merriment nature produced exactly 69 snu in the ga experiments .",
    "sage reported its first results in 1990 @xcite , and gallex in 1992 @xcite . every experiment reported rates far below the expectations of the ssm .",
    "the idea that neutrino physics might be responsible for the solar neutrino problem @xcite was initially greeted with skepticism .",
    "perhaps mixing might take place , but quark mixing angles were known to be small , and why should neutrinos be any different ? it was revived by the theoretical discovery of matter enhancement , the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein effect @xcite , which allowed small vacuum mixing angles to be greatly amplified in matter .",
    "( once again , nature laughed and gave us nearly maximal mixing _ and _ the msw effect . )    in 1985 herb chen , george ewan , and collaborators proposed the construction of a large , real - time heavy - water cherenkov detector to measure the @xmath2b rate in both charged - current and neutral - current interactions , thus decoupling the neutrino physics from the astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory reported its first results in 2001 @xcite , comparing the pure cc rate to the elastic scattering ( es ) rate seen in the super - kamiokande detector @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that indeed the predicted neutrino flux was all there but that 2/3 of the electron neutrinos had converted to mu and tau neutrinos on their way to earth .",
    "with steadily increasing precision , the measurements showed also the presence of neutrons liberated by neutral - current interactions with deuterium , again at 3 times the rate that would be expected from the cc data in the absence of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the solar neutrino problem has been resolved , and neutrino flavor change demonstrated in an appearance experiment .",
    "neutrino oscillations and mass explain the observed effects well . the detailed model developed by bahcall and many other astrophysicists",
    "was found to be astonishingly good , predicting the central temperature of the sun to a stunning 1% accuracy . the standard model of particles and fields",
    "must now be modified to include massive neutrinos .",
    "what does the future hold for solar neutrinos ?",
    "only the radiochemical experiments provide information about the part of the spectrum from 0 to 5 mev , where @xmath5 99% of the neutrinos reside . to consider the consequences of assuming all is well there",
    ", one need only imagine davis and bahcall making the same assumption in 1965 and deciding to work on something else .",
    "as it turns out , that region is where the transition from matter enhancement to vacuum oscillations takes place .",
    "the detailed behavior of the transition is quite sensitive to the presence of nonstandard interactions , and a spectroscopic measurement of neutrinos there would be definitive .",
    "another interesting objective is to realize that , with sufficiently precise data , one could directly test the relationship between neutrino luminosity and radiant energy luminosity .",
    "the fact that neutrinos from the center of the sun reach earth in 8 minutes , while photons take some 40,000 years @xcite , would yield an eerie look at the future of the sun s life - giving energy .",
    "three experiments , sage , super - kamiokande ( sk ) , and sno are currently in operation .",
    "a fourth , kamland , is a terrestrial reactor antineutrino experiment , but it provides information intimately related to the solar neutrino data . taken together with the earlier results from cl - ar , gallex , and gno , the data from those experiments provide a remarkably precise picture of the mixing of two neutrinos and of the flux of high - energy neutrinos from the sun .",
    "beginning in january , 1990 with 30 mg of ga metal , sage @xcite has continuously recorded solar neutrinos via the reaction ,    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ coeffs ]    the experimentally determined rates and ratios used as input are listed in table [ tab : results ] , and the results are summarized in fig . [",
    "fig : lum ] .",
    "the uncertainties are large and will remain so until a determination of the @xmath6be flux is made , but it is remarkable how a model - independent analysis of the low - energy solar data together with a model - independent determination of neutrino oscillation parameters together produce results very consistent with solar models .",
    "the ssm relies on a large body of painstaking laboratory work in a number of different research areas .",
    "in addition , there are laboratory inputs that affect directly the extraction of neutrino oscillation parameters in model - independent analyses .",
    "the past few years have seen great progress in improving the accuracy with which important nuclear - physics inputs are known .",
    "much remains to be done , however . for a comprehensive general summary ,",
    "the reader is referred to the recent paper by haxton , parker , and rolfs @xcite . a number of additional reactions are included in the discussion below .",
    "the commissioning of the luna accelerator in the gran sasso laboratory has made possible two important measurements that would have been overwhelmed at the lowest energies by backgrounds if done on the surface .",
    "the @xmath7he(@xmath7he,2p)@xmath8he reaction has been measured down to energies completely inclusive of the gamow peak where stellar burning takes place @xcite .",
    "the rate - determining step in the cno cycle is the @xmath9n(p,@xmath10)@xmath11o reaction , and a precise determination of its rate was identified as a priority in the evaluation conducted in 1998 @xcite .",
    "that was accomplished both at luna @xcite and at lena @xcite , resulting in a recommended s - factor , 1.67 kev b , a factor of 2 smaller than the previously accepted value .",
    "there is insufficient data for a completely model - independent analysis of the cno flux from the sun , but in 2002 , bahcall , gonzalez - garcia , and pea - garay @xcite carried out an analysis similar to that reported in this paper , a fit to the fluxes as free parameters under the assumption of the lma solution , but invoking also the luminosity constraint .",
    "the higher cross section for cno neutrino capture as compared to _",
    "@xmath6be neutrinos then allows a limit to be set on the cno flux .",
    "et al . _  concluded that the solar cno luminosity was ( at 3@xmath12 ) less than 7.3% of the total luminosity .    before the new measurements of the @xmath9n(p,@xmath10)@xmath11o cross section , cno neutrinos constituted 1.6% of the total flux from the sun in a standard solar model @xcite . with the revised cross section ,",
    "the fraction is 0.8% @xcite .",
    "an analysis @xcite by the gno collaboration using ga data , the luminosity constraint , and the ssm value for the @xmath6be flux , gave as a central value for the cno flux fraction 0.8% ( ! ) , and a 3@xmath12-limit of 6.5% .",
    "the cross section of this reaction at the gamow peak , about 20 kev , is determined by means of theoretical extrapolation from higher energies at which laboratory measurements can be made .",
    "the resulting accuracy has thus both a theoretical and an experimental component .",
    "recently , measurements of this cross section with an overall uncertainty of 3.8% have been reported @xcite . at this level of precision",
    ", this cross section plays a minor role in the overall uncertainty in the ssm prediction of the @xmath2b flux .",
    "opacities and the cross section for @xmath7he(@xmath13)@xmath6be make substantially larger contributions .",
    "two experimental methods for determining the cross section for this process in the laboratory , direct measurement of capture gammas , and the quantitative assay of the amount of @xmath6be produced , do not agree well , and as a result the rate of this reaction in the sun is uncertain by about 9% .",
    "several laboratories are undertaking new measurements ( luna , the university of washington , and others ) .",
    "the shape of the neutrino spectrum from @xmath2b decay enters directly into determinations of neutrino oscillation parameters , quite independent of any solar models . the shape is not determined in the usual way from weak - interaction theory , because the final state in @xmath2be is unbound and broad , with a beta strength function that calls for experimental measurement . for some time the standard was an analysis @xcite of several experiments undertaken for reasons unrelated to solar neutrino research . a new measurement by ortiz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite indicated that the neutrino spectrum at high energies was significantly harder , and that spectrum was used in the analysis of sk and sno data .",
    "however , still more recent experimental work by winter _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite gave results in agreement with the earlier spectra and in disagreement with ortiz _",
    "et al._. results obtained in a new experiment by bhattacharya _",
    "_  @xcite are in excellent agreement with the results of winter _",
    "et al._.      as described in more detail in haxton _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the _ hep _ reaction has a very low intensity and no significant role in energy production in the sun , but the very high endpoint energy ( 18.77 mev ) makes the reaction potentially observable .",
    "both sno and sk are in the process of analyzing data to observe or set limits on this process .",
    "the s - wave capture is very hindered owing to different principal quantum numbers in the initial and final state wave functions , and about 40% of the capture proceeds via the p - wave . as a result",
    "the beta spectrum does not have a standard allowed shape , but no calculation of the spectral shape has yet been made .",
    "the experimental groups need that calculation in order to extract a total rate from the high - energy events above the @xmath2b endpoint .",
    "the decay of @xmath2b directly to the ground state of @xmath2be involves a spin change of 2 , and so is very hindered .",
    "however , the high energy of the resulting neutrinos would place them in the same energy region as the observable part of the _ hep _ reaction , and so it is important to determine if such a branch exists .",
    "preliminary data taken at the university of washington by bacrania and storm @xcite indicates the branch is less than 10@xmath14 and thus not a significant contributor .",
    "a number of ` new physics ' ideas beyond the now - standard lma solution with 3 active species have been proposed that could be tested with present and future solar neutrino experimental data .",
    "these include sterile neutrino admixtures @xcite , neutrino magnetic moments and resonant spin - flavor precession @xcite , and non - standard - model interactions @xcite .",
    "the analysis above , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lum ] , establishes the equality within experimental errors of the electromagnetic luminosity and the active - flavor neutrino luminosity . as such , even at the present level of accuracy , it sets a very general limit on the contribution of sterile neutrinos to the solar neutrino flux , but one that is also considerably more restrictive than those derived with reference to , for example , the ssm prediction of the @xmath2b flux . at the 90% confidence level , sterile neutrinos do not constitute more than roughly 12% of the flux .",
    "consideration of the potential of future solar neutrino experiments suggests that highly sensitive tests will become possible .",
    "the sno experiment will cease data - taking at the end of 2006 , but sage and sk will continue .",
    "they will , it is to be hoped , be joined by several new experiments aimed at precision investigation of the region below 5 mev in the solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "two experiments , borexino and kamland solar , are approved and under construction .",
    "three others , lens , sno+ , and clean , are in an active r&d phase that will most likely be followed by full proposals .",
    "two experiments , heron and moon solar , have undergone extensive r&d but are not at present on a trajectory to a full proposal .      a liquid - scintillator es experiment with a 100 mg fiducial mass , borexino is under construction in lngs ( gran sasso ) @xcite .",
    "an accidental release of pseudocumene scintillator to the environment in 2003 precipitated a suspension of construction while remedies were put in place to prevent a similar occurrence in the future .",
    "most of that work has now been completed and it is expected that permission will be forthcoming to complete the detector as planned .      the kamland detector is already in operation as a reactor antineutrino detector .",
    "the antineutrino signal provides a delayed coincidence tag ( neutron capture ) that completely rejects single - event backgrounds . in order to make the detector suitable for detecting low - energy solar neutrinos by elastic scattering ,",
    "reductions of contained @xmath15pb , @xmath16k , @xmath17kr , @xmath18rn , @xmath19th , and @xmath20u by factors ranging up to 10@xmath21 are required .",
    "a distillation plant is under construction .",
    "distillation removes the ppo fluor from the scintillator , and clean replacement material must be found and reintroduced .",
    "another difficulty is cosmogenic activity at the depth of kamioka , about 2000 mwe .",
    "many such activities are sufficiently short lived that the interval following the passage of a muon can be vetoed , but 20-minute @xmath22c requires special treatment .",
    "it nevertheless leaves a clear window in which the @xmath6be solar neutrino line can be observed .    when kamland solar will be ready for data taking will depend on the performance of the distillation plant and other purification measures .",
    "tests will begin in 2006 .      while the heavy water from sno is to be returned to the owners in 2007",
    ", the potential use of the cavity , acrylic vessel , and phototube array has not gone unrecognized .",
    "sno+ is a proposal to fill the acrylic vessel with liquid scintillator @xcite .",
    "that would result in a detector of similar size and properties as kamland , but at the 6010-mwe depth of sno .",
    "cosmogenic activities would not be a concern , and the reactor antineutrino `` background '' would also be considerably smaller .",
    "one potentially thorny problem , the aggressive nature of most scintillator liquids to acrylic , has been resolved with the discovery @xcite that linear alkylbenzenes , common chemical intermediates in detergent manufacturing , make an efficient and non - aggressive scintillator .",
    "noble liquids are highly efficient scintillators transparent to their own radiation , and among them he and ne possess no long - lived isotopes that represent backgrounds to solar neutrinos .",
    "their low boiling points permit fractionation to remove other troublesome contaminants such as @xmath17kr .",
    "the clean concept @xcite involves lne and a wavelength - shifter on the surface of the container where phototubes are mounted .",
    "event positions can be reconstructed via the luminance distribution at the surface .",
    "heron @xcite makes use of both scintillation light and electrons liberated by ionizing radiation to reconstruct the energy and position within the fiducial volume , and to reject events that have multiple interaction sites , such as compton interactions .",
    "the lens experiment , an active , spectroscopic , charged - current experiment , has been under development in various forms for many years @xcite . the basic principle is to make use of a neutrino capture to an excited state , the decay of which leads to an isomer .",
    "the delayed decay of the isomer provides a tag to reject backgrounds .",
    "the most favorable case once again appears to be @xmath23 in , with a 4.76-@xmath24s isomer in the daughter @xmath23sn .",
    "the q - value to this state is only -114 kev , but unfortunately , by the standards of solar neutrino rates , in is intensely radioactive , with a half - life of @xmath25 years .",
    "thus , most r&d effort has gone into strategies for mitigating this inherent background . the 498-kev beta background and associated bremsstrahlung intrude as chance coincidences .",
    "recent successes in development of an in - loaded scintillator have produced 8% loading with attenuation scarcely worse than pure pseudocumene , good resolution , and long - term stablility @xcite .",
    "good resolution helps reject the continuous beta background .",
    "another advance has been development of an array of cubical cells to contain the scintillator and guide light predominantly to phototubes on the cell s major axes . in this way",
    "good segmentation can be obtained without excessive numbers of channels .",
    "a detector of 125 - 190 mg fiducial mass , containing 10 - 15 mg of in , is currently envisaged .",
    "the moon concept @xcite for solar neutrinos takes advantage of the very large matrix element for @xmath26 capture connecting the ground state of @xmath27mo to the @xmath28 ground state of @xmath27tc , with a q - value of -168 kev . the subsequent beta decay of 16-s",
    "@xmath27tc provides a tag to identify the solar neutrino capture and reject backgrounds .",
    "the primary technical challenge is the @xmath29 background from the decay of @xmath30-y @xmath27mo . in order to reduce the random coincidences to a level below the signal",
    ", the detector must be effectively subdivided with a volume resolution corresponding to less than 100 mg of @xmath27mo .",
    "solar neutrino research has a luminous past and a bright future .",
    "it has contributed in a major way to a revolution in fundamental physics that has required the first revision to the standard model of particles and fields .",
    "neutrinos are strongly mixed in flavor and have non - zero masses .",
    "the next steps for the field are generally agreed upon : precise , spectroscopic measurement of the low - energy fluxes from the sun .",
    "a direct confrontation of the luminosity constraint is a matter of considerable importance even beyond the fields of physics and astrophysics .",
    "the combination of intensity and remoteness of the solar neutrino source gives it power to test for the presence of non - standard neutrino physics inaccessible to other kinds of experiment .",
    "the unexpected can continue to be expected .",
