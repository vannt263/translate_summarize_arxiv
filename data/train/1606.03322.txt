    "during the international year of light we have developed a fiber - based optical interferometer for undergraduate lab courses .",
    "the experiment aims to familiarize the students with interferometry , fourier transform spectroscopy and optical amplification .",
    "the set - up is based on a fibered mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "this type of interferometer is classically used in telecommunication to control the amplitude of optical signals.@xcite the first part of the laboratory project is concerned with fourier transform spectroscopy ( fts ) .",
    "an advantage of the fts is that it needs only one detector pixel . when infrared detector arrays were not commonly accessible , fts was the preferred method for spectroscopy in astronomy .",
    "the students use two sources ( a fabry - perot laser and a superluminescent diode ) , they modulate the optical path difference ( opd ) between the two arms of the interferometer , and fourier transform the amplitude of the fringes as a function of opd . from this",
    "they deduce the spectrum of the light source .    in a second part of the project",
    ", an optical amplifier is placed in one and then both arms of the interferometer .",
    "the pattern observed behind an interferometer shows interference fringes , provided there is no way to determine which arm a photon has passed .",
    "when coherent photon pulses from a laser pass an optical amplifier , they stimulate the emission of identical , coherent photons by the atoms of the amplifier medium .",
    "the student is invited to predict the outcome of this experiment . are the stimulated photons localized in one arm ? in this case , they should not contribute interferences . or does the process of stimulated emission not constrain the position of the incoming photons , so that the interference pattern is preserved and even amplified through the contribution of the stimulated emissions ?",
    "the student will observe that the amplitude of the fringes increases with the amplifier gain , while the normalized contrast decreases .",
    "thus the incoming and stimulated photons contribute both to interferences .",
    "the effect of an amplification of gain @xmath2 is equivalent to enlarging one of the holes in a classic young experiment by a factor @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the areas of the holes .",
    "the students also understand that spontaneously emitted photons add a continuous incoherent signal , which decreases the contrast of the fringes .",
    "our experiment is based on fibered optics , which eliminates the need for optical alignment  rather than aligning an optical component , one connects a fiber .",
    "it also exposes students to fiber technology .",
    "all components are off - the - shelf , i.e. from standard optical catalogues .",
    "section[sec : inst ] presents the design and set - up of the instrument , section[sec : report ] details the different parts of the laboratory project and presents results from student reports .",
    "the american journal of physics has published several articles on mach - zehnder interferometers built from bulk optics.@xcite other articles have described fibered fabry - perot or michelson interferometers as instructional tools.@xcite the experiment that we set up  a fibered interferometer used in combination with optical amplifiers  is commonly used to realize high - speed optical switches and logical gates.@xcite to our knowledge its use for educational purposes has not yet been described .",
    "the set - up of our mach - zehnder interferometer is shown on fig.[fig : setup ] : the light is emitted either by a narrow - band fabry - perot source or a wider - band super - luminescent diode ( sld ) .",
    "both sources are centered at @xmath6 m . we chose to work at this telecommunication wavelength , because it allows us to use a broad range of components available from standard optics catalogues .",
    "table[tab : comp ] lists the components used in this experiment .",
    "figure[fig : photo ] shows a picture of the set - up .",
    "the fabry - perot source has several thin spectral lines and fringes are obtained even far from path - length equality .",
    "the path lengths are equalized by adjusting the delay lines and by following the gradient of increasing fringe contrast .",
    "afterwards , the sld is used to measure fringe contrasts because its fringe pattern is more stable : with the fabry - perot laser , reflections on optical interfaces easily produce spurious interference effects and this generates instabilities in the fringe pattern .",
    "the light is propagated along monomode , panda - style polarization - maintaining fibers ( nufern pm1550-xp ) .",
    "it is important that the fibers are polarization maintaining so that the light field does nt fluctuate between non - interfering polarization states .",
    "all other components are likewise polarization - maintaining , and therefore bi - refringent .",
    "we have bought a fibered polarizer to remove any remaining crosstalk between polarizations .",
    "the students may place the polarizer either before or after the interferometer .",
    "the light is sent along the two arms of the interferometer via a beam - splitter .",
    "a mach - zehnder set - up was chosen because it provides ample space for optical components in the arms .",
    "the path lengths of the two arms are equalized via delay lines .",
    "these lines are the only components that were not purchased from thorlabs .",
    "they are however available as standard catalogue items from ozoptics .",
    "each line introduces a maximum delay of 2.5 cm , thus the total amplitude for path - length equalization is 5.0 cm when a delay - line is placed in each arm .",
    "the path equalization is done manually via a micrometer screw .",
    "the experiment could likewise be designed with motorized delay - lines and different delay amplitudes .",
    "the optical path - difference is rapidly modulated with a lithium niobate phase - modulator . when the modulator is addressed with a sawtooth or a triangular signal of roughly @xmath7v amplitude ,",
    "the phase changes linearly with an amplitude of approximately @xmath8 .",
    "the frequency of the signal typically lies around a few hundred hertz .",
    "the modulator allows to visualize a fringe pattern on the oscilloscope .",
    "it has an smp connector , thus a bnc to smp cable is required to connect a function generator to the modulator .",
    "the cable was made by our kind laboratory technician .",
    "we place a modulator in each arm and address them with inverted signals .",
    "the amplitude of the phase modulation is then doubled and more fringes are visible on the oscilloscope . in order to address the two modulators with inverted signals ,",
    "the two function generators need to be driven synchronously and in anti - phase .",
    "this is done by using the ` sync ' output of one generator as a trigger signal for the other generator , i.e. by connecting the ` sync ' output to the ` external trigger ' input of the other generator .",
    "alternatively , one may use a function generator that directly outputs two anti - phased signals .    in the second part of the experiment an optical amplifier",
    "is placed in one and then both arms .",
    "we use erbium doped fiber amplifiers ( edfa ) , which amplify light around 1.55@xmath0 m .",
    "the light is recombined via a second beam - splitter and sent onto a single - pixel detector .",
    "the detector generates a voltage that is proportional to the incident light intensity .",
    "this voltage is visualized on an oscilloscope .",
    "the oscilloscope data can be stored in .csv files .",
    "initially we bought 1 m long monomode fibers to link the different components of the interferometer .",
    "however , all components have slightly different path lengths : the path lengths of the two phase modulators differ by 1 cm , while the path lengths of the amplifiers differ by 12 cm .",
    "the amplitude of the delay lines ( 5 cm ) was not sufficient to account for those differences .",
    "we therefore bought fibers of different lengths , between 1.0 m and 1.3 m in increments of 0.1 m .",
    "these fibers are not part of the standard thorlabs catalogue , but can be ordered from their website.@xcite    almost all the optical components have fc - apc connectors ( fiber connection - angle physical contact ) : the fibers are cut at @xmath9 and reflections are then negligible .",
    "this is in contrast to fc - pc connectors ( fiber connection - physical contact ) where fibers are cut at right angle and hence , if a fiber is left unconnected , light is reflected with a fresnel reflection coefficient @xmath10 . the fabry - perot laser and the phase modulators were however only available with fc / pc connectors .",
    "we thus purchased patch cables that convert fc - pc to fc - apc ( thorlabs part number p5 - 1550pm - fc-2 ) .",
    ".purchased parts .",
    "all parts are manufactured by thorlabs except for the delay lines from ozoptics . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : comp ]    fiber optical components are fragile .",
    "the fibers may be broken if they are twisted or strongly bent .",
    "the fiber interfaces can also easily be damaged and students are reminded to systematically protect the interfaces with plastic covers .",
    "the machine shop built protective plexiglas boxes for the beam - splitters , the phase modulators and the delay lines .",
    "these are transparent and their cover can be unscrewed , if the students wish to measure the fiber lengths .",
    "note that we have written the approximate path - length of each component on its box .",
    "hence , the students mostly leave the components untouched , which reduces the risk of damaging the most expensive optical components . the light sources , amplifiers and the detector are delivered within boxes .",
    "the different boxes are then connected via monomode fibers that have protective outer jackets ( 3 mm in diameter ) .",
    "the two laser sources and the optical amplifiers are class 1 m lasers .",
    "these lasers are safe and the maximum permissible radiation exposure can not generally be exceeded .",
    "however , the students should still be warned never to look onto a fiber output directly , especially as radiation at 1.5@xmath0 m is not visible .",
    "the project is divided into two parts : the students first use the delay lines of the mach - zehnder to do fourier transform spectroscopy ( fts ) . in this first section",
    "the contrast as a function of optical path - length difference is used to derive the spectra of different light sources . in the second part of the project",
    "an amplifier is placed in one and then in each arm of the interferometer . for a shorter project",
    "the experiment can be reduced to its first part .",
    "fts is most easily explained by considering the wave nature of light .",
    "the electric field is written as a superposition of monochromatic waves .",
    "it is represented as a complex function of frequency @xmath11 and time @xmath12 : @xmath13 we consider frequencies between @xmath14 to @xmath15 to simplify the fourier transformations .",
    "the amplitude of negative frequency waves can be set to zero .",
    "@xmath16 is a complex parameter that contains the phase and amplitude of each monochromatic wave .",
    "note that we would use a vector instead of a scalar if we wanted to account for polarization . here , we neglect the effect of polarization , since we are using polarization maintaining fibers .",
    "the intensity observed at a time @xmath12 , on a hypothetical detector of infinitively small response time , is related to the electric field via : @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the detector used in this experiment is a photodiode with a 1ghz bandwidth .",
    "the signal is thus integrated over 1ns , which is long compared to the frequency of the field : @xmath18thz at @xmath19 m . we can therefore make the following approximation : @xmath20 ^ 2 > =   < \\im[e(t)]^2 > = \\frac { < \\re[e(t)]^2 > +   < \\im[e(t)]^2 > } { 2 } = \\frac { < e(t ) e^*(t)>}{2 }   \\label{eq : ee}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the average over the integration time of the detector .",
    "the above relations use the fact that the squares of cosine and sine have the same average over many periods .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) , @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "hence , @xmath23    the integration times are long compared to the wave periods , hence : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dirac function which is null for any value of @xmath11 different from @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath27 and @xmath28 this relation means that the polychromatic intensity is the sum of the intensities contained in the monochromatic waves .",
    "this is re - assuring for energy conservation , but it s not trivial for the students to demonstrate this .    the interferometer is set up as shown on fig.[fig : setup ] , without optical amplifiers and with the fabry - perot laser source .",
    "the phase modulators are controlled with triangular signals of @xmath29v amplitude at a few hundred hertz .",
    "the modulators are operated in anti - phase .",
    "the path lengths in the two arms should be roughly equalized , with a precision of a few centimeters , so that the final adjustment can be made with the micrometer screws of the delay lines .",
    "the spectrum of the fabry - perot source contains narrow lines and fringes are therefore observed even far from path - length equality : fringes may be observed a few meters away from path - equality .",
    "the paths are equalized by adjusting the delay lines and by following the gradient of increasing fringe contrast .",
    "once the path lengths are roughly equal , fringes can also be found with the sld source .",
    "the evolution of the interference pattern as a function of optical path - length difference is then used to characterize the spectral response of different light sources .",
    "the intensity observed on the detector results now from the interference of two waves that have travelled different optical path - lengths .",
    "this difference translates into a time delay between the two waves coming from both arms of the interferometer : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are real values which correspond to the splitting ratio of the light wave in the two arms .",
    "the light intensities in arms 1 and 2 are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "for flux conservation , @xmath36 if the splitting is lossless .",
    "the time delay is @xmath37 .",
    "we assume that the beam - splitter is achromatic so that both fields have the same spectral dependance @xmath16 . the electric field at the output of the interferometer is the sum of the two fields : @xmath38 + k_2 \\ , { \\rm ft\\/}[a(\\nu ) \\exp ( j 2 \\pi \\nu \\delta ) ]    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath39 \\cdot { \\rm ft\\/}^ * [ a(\\nu ) ]   > \\nonumber \\\\    & & + |k_2|^2",

    "resonant modes are expected when the fabry - perot cavity length is a multiple of half the wavelength .",
    "hence the students can deduce the cavity length from their data : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the distance between peaks in the spectrum . in this particular case ,",
    "the student obtained a cavity length of @xmath65 mm , close to the manufacturer specifications of approximately 1.07 mm .",

    "the contrast approaches 1 as @xmath92 : the fringe pattern has an excellent contrast even though most of the photons are generated inside the interferometer .",
    "we have presented a new fiber - based interferometric experiment .",
    "fiber optical components are expensive and the budget of this set - up has reached @xmath93 . we feel that this investment is justified because students become familiar with widely - used fiber technology , they get hands - on experience with interferometry and improve their understanding of optical amplification .",
    "the experiment has now become part of the syllabus for third year physics students .    by now , five students have successfully worked on the experiment over two - week periods ( mainly over half - days , so the project could also be offered as a full - time one week project ) .",
    "the students are in their third year and they are given much liberty on the conduct of the project .",
    "the report notably asks questions on the physics involved , rather then giving instructions on how to assemble the experiment .",
    "the students then figure out which measurements are needed to answer these questions .",
    "they are free to spend more or less time on the different parts of the experiment .",
    "we were positively surprised by the variety of the students reports : one student spent the bigger part of the project characterizing and modeling the optical amplifiers , while another student meticulously characterized the light sources with and without amplification , via a fourier analysis of the fringe contrast .",
    "their reports analyze the differences between their measurements and the manufacturer specifications .",
    "this ensures that the experiment has been well understood .",
    "all students managed to obtain stable fringe patterns for the various instrumental set - ups : the classic mach - zehnder interferometer and its modified version with an amplifier in one or both arms .",
    "nothing has been broken yet .",
    "the experiment has thus proven reliable so far .",
    "let us finally note that  much like a report by danan et al.@xcite  the analysis of the photon trajectories inside our interferometer can come as a surprise . intriguingly , the photons that are stimulated inside one arm of the interferometer still contribute to the interference pattern because one can not distinguish the incoming and stimulated photons .",
    "neither danan et al.s nor our experiment is ran in the single photon regime and the resulting interference patterns are easily understood when the wave nature of light is considered .",
    "the outcome of the experiment is , however , harder to conciliate with the particle nature of light .",
    "this intriguing evolution of the photons inside our modified interferometer helps to understand stimulated emission .",
    "we acknowledge our lab technician richard king for his constant and extremely helpful assistance .",
    "we also thank john richer and pietro cicuta for suggesting to develop a new experiment , for providing the necessary funds and for their general interest and support .",

    "<S> we present an experiment based on a fibered mach - zehnder interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to familiarize students with fibered optics and interferometry , and to improve their understanding of optical amplification . </S>",
    "<S> the laboratory project has two parts : in a first part , the students modulate the optical path of the interferometer to study the spectra of light sources via fourier transform spectroscopy . in a second part </S>",
    "<S> , an optical amplifier is placed in one or both arms of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the set - up uses monomode , polarization - maintaining fibers that propagate light of 1.5@xmath0 m wavelength . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the set - up and the analysis of the measurements , and we present results from student reports . </S>",
    "<S> all components are part of standard optical catalogues . </S>",
    "<S> even though the experiment is based on fibered optics , it is robust to manipulation ( it is however relatively expensive @xmath1 ) : we describe our efforts to protect the components from damage . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment is now offered as a 2-week project for third - year physics students . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment may likewise be of value in early graduate level laboratory courses . </S>"
