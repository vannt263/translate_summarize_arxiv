    "the standard model ( sm ) provides an excellent effective field theory description of almost all particle physics experiments . however , the theoretical shortcomings of the sm , such as quadratic divergencies , the triviality of a @xmath4 theory , etc , suggest that it should be embedded in a larger scheme . many popular new physics ( np ) models beyond the sm have been proposed , and some of which predict the existence of new charged leptons .",
    "any signal for such kind of particles in future high energy experiments will play a milestone role in discovery of np .",
    "thus , studying production and decay of the new charged leptons in future high energy collider experiments is of special interest .",
    "little higgs theory @xcite is proposed as an interesting solution to the so - called hierarchy problem of the sm and can be regarded as one of the important candidates for np beyond the sm . among of the little higgs models , the littlest higgs ( lh ) model @xcite has all essential features of the little higgs models",
    ". however , the original version of the lh model suffers from precision electroweak ( ew ) constrains , the np effects are small as the np scale @xmath5 is required to be above 2 - 3@xmath6 in order to satisfy the ew precision constraints , which re - introduces the fine tuning and the little hierarchy problem @xcite@xcite . the lh model with t - parity ( lht )",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite is one of the attractive little higgs models . in the lht model ,",
    "all dangerous tree - level contributions to low energy ew observables are forbidden by t - parity and hence the corrections to low energy ew observables are loop - suppressed and small @xcite@xcite . as a result",
    ", the relatively low new particle mass scale @xmath5 is still allowed by data , e.g. , @xmath7 @xcite .    in the lht model ,",
    "particle fields are divided into t - even and t - odd sectors under t - parity and the sm fields are t - even . in order to implement t - parity in the fermion sector ,",
    "one introduces three doublets of mirror quarks and mirror leptons , which have t - odd parity , transform vectorially under @xmath8 and can be given large masses .",
    "these mirror fermions have new flavor violating interactions with the sm fermions mediated by the new gauge bosons and at higher order by the triplet scalar , which might generate significantly contributions to some flavor violation processes @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the lht mirror fermion interactions can yield large np effects in the quark sector @xcite@xcite@xcite and the lepton sector @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "so far , lots of studies about the heavy charged leptons have previously been done at hadron colliders .",
    "however , there exists some difficulties to detect heavy lepton production at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , due to large backgrounds .",
    "compared to hadron colliders , the future international linear @xmath3 collider ( ilc ) has the advantage in performing experimental measurement with a particularly clean environment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ilc can provide complementary information for np with performing precision measurements that would complete the lhc results .",
    "many works involving the new charged leptons have been given at the ilc .",
    "studies about the heavy charged leptons predicted by the lht model have previously been done at the lhc @xcite and ilc@xcite . as a complementary production mode to the former research",
    ", this paper is to study the production processes of the t - odd leptons in association with a neutral gauge boson @xmath9 , or @xmath2 ) at the ilc experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the lht model and then give the relevant couplings . in section iii , we devote to the computation of the production cross section of the process @xmath10 .",
    "the study of the production process @xmath11 is presented in section iv . some phenomenological analysis",
    "are included in the above two sections .",
    "the conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the lht model is based on an @xmath12 global symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "a subgroup @xmath13_{1}\\times[su(2)\\times u(1)]_{2}$ ] of the @xmath14 global symmetry is gauged , and at the scale @xmath5 it is broken into the sm ew symmetry @xmath15 .",
    "t - parity is an automorphism that exchanges the @xmath13_{1}$ ] and @xmath13_{2}$ ] gauge symmetries .",
    "the t - even combinations of the gauge fields are the ew gauge bosons , and the t - odd combinations are their t - parity partners . after taking into account ew symmetry breaking , at the order of @xmath16 , the masses of the t - odd set of the @xmath17 gauge bosons",
    "are given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the corresponding coupling constants of @xmath8 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the ew scale and @xmath5 is the scale parameter of the gauge symmetry breaking of the lht model .",
    "moreover , because of the smallness of @xmath20 , the t - odd gauge boson @xmath23 is the lightest t - odd particle , which is stable , electrically neutral , and weakly interacting particle .",
    "thus , it can be seen as an attractive dark matter candidate @xcite . to avoid severe constraints and",
    "simultaneously implement t - parity , one needs to double the sm fermion doublet spectrum @xcite@xcite .",
    "the t - even combination is associated with the @xmath8 doublet , while the t - odd combination is its t - parity partner . at the leading order",
    ", the masses of the t - odd fermions can be written in a unified manner as : @xmath24 where the yukawa couplings @xmath25 can in general depend on the fermion species @xmath26 .",
    "one of the important ingredients of the mirror sector in the lht model is the existence of ckm - like unitary mixing matrices .",
    "mirror fermions are characterized by new flavor interactions with sm fermions and heavy gauge bosons , which involve two new unitary mixing matrices in the quark sector , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and two in the lepton sector , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite@xcite .",
    "these mirror mixing matrices parameterize flavor - changing ( fc ) interactions between the sm fermions and the mirror fermions .",

    "certainly , the trilinear coupling @xmath49 can also contribute to the process @xmath50 .",
    "however , this kind of couplings are induced at the one - loop level by a fermion triangle and its contributions are very small @xcite .",
