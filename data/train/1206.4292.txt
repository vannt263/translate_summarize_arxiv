    "in summary , we provide a different and realistic explanation to the experimental observations of the ising - like spin excitation modes in hg1201 based on the presence of additional hg - o states close to @xmath16 as established by first - principles and photoemission electronic structure considerations .",
    "the higher energy @xmath28 mode is fairly doping independent , and based on our calculation we predict that it should survive to overdoping . on the other hand the second mode appears as a result of the proximity induced magnetic order in the hg - atoms and hence it is doping and temperature dependent .",
    "these facts are in accord with experimental data .",
    "the similar observation of the @xmath28 mode in the ybco sample@xcite can also be explained within the same framework due to the presence of a metallic chain state in this sample.@xcite furthermore , in double layered bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath75 ( bi2212 ) , first - principles calculations@xcite find that the bi - o band lies close to the fermi level or may even cross it near the same @xmath76 point and thus can give rise to a similar @xmath0 magnetic mode , but its energy scale is yet to be explored .",
    "however , despite extensive neutron studies in other hole - doped cuprates , any signature of this @xmath12 mode has not yet been reported supporting our theory .",
    "the gap opening in the hg - o state can be tested by scanning tunneling microscopy , optical and x - ray absorption spectroscopies , whereas the prediction of magnetic order in hg - o layer can be verified via nmr , neutron measurements .",

    "<S> ( 1 ) electron doped cuprates consistently demonstrate the presence of a commensurate antiferromagnetic order up to the superconducting ( sc ) region.@xcite ( 2 ) in single layer hole doped la@xmath5(ba / sr)@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( lb / sco ) , the commensurate order is observed to become incommensurate with doping ( with a so - called ` hour - glass ' dispersion in the spin - excitation spectrum ) , and rotates along the cu - o bond direction as the sc dome develops.@xcite such phenomena have been taken as evidence of the ` stripe ' order origin of the pseudogap in these systems.@xcite ( 3 ) in yba@xmath1cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ( ybco ) , the incommensurate spin - excitation further exhibits an in - plane anisotropy , having stronger intensity along the @xmath10-bond direction than the @xmath11-direction , a fact which has been interpreted as the emergence of electronic nematic order.@xcite ( 4 ) in addition to the ` hour - glass ' pattern , which is a trademark of all these hole doped systems , a @xmath12 mode is observed in single layer hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( hg1201),@xcite which further splits in energy.@xcite such an ising - like mode can be expected within a circulating orbital current model.@xcite    understanding such diverse material dependence of the spin - excitation properties in cuprates within a single model has remained a challenge . </S>",
    "<S> however , some efforts to obtain a unified model interpretation should be mentioned . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the model of coexistence of an ( either long- or short - ranged ) spin - density wave ( sdw ) and @xmath13-wave superconductivity for electron doped cuprates to the hole doped side is one of these successful approaches.@xcite within this model , it has been shown that the commensurate mode is lifted to higher energy by the sc gap with a downward dispersion reaching to zero energy due to the nodal @xmath13-wave momentum @xmath14 dependence of the sc gap.@xcite in other words , the spin - excitation manifests itself as static incommensurate peaks via coupling to the nodal @xmath13-wave sc gap . </S>",
    "<S> this model reproduces the ` hour - glass ' pattern , a 45@xmath15 rotation of the incommensurate spectra in all these systems . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the same model has been applied to quantitatively explain the additional in - plane anisotropy in ybco by incorporating the inter - layer coupling between the cuo@xmath1 plane and the metallic _ unidirectional _ cuo chain plane which is present at all finite dopings.@xcite this calculation does not require any ` spontaneous ' nematic order . in the present paper , we extend the model to the hg1201 system to explain the coexistence of both the ` hour - glass ' pattern and the @xmath0 modes .    </S>",
    "<S> looking into the first - principles band structure,@xcite we find that there exists a hg - o band which lies so close to the fermi level ( @xmath16 ) that it can contribute to the low - energy physics in this compound . constrained by this band - structure property </S>",

    "<S> we compute the spin excitation spectrum to show that due to the interaction between these two plane states , a @xmath0 collective mode develops in the multi - orbital spin channel . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that when a sdw order or any other similar translational symmetry breaking order sets in the cuo@xmath1 plane in the pseudogap regime , it induces a magnetic moment to the hg - o state which splits the @xmath0 mode in energy , but not in momentum . </S>",

    "<S> the cuo@xmath1 antibonding state is clearly visible , and it only constitutes the fs . </S>",
    "<S> an essential difference between the cuo@xmath1 and hg - o layers is that despite the absence of o - atoms in the hg - plane , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) , first - principles calculations exhibit that the latter state ( the green line above @xmath16 ) originates from the hybridization between the hg and o atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this crucial information emphasizes that the inter - layer tunneling matrix - element @xmath26 is important and can not be neglected for any realistic computation . </S>",

    "<S> the widely believed origin of the spin - resonance mode at @xmath30 is due to the the sign - reversal of the @xmath31wave pairing at the magnetic ` hot - spot ' on the fs of the cuo@xmath1 state.@xcite here we show that the @xmath32 mode is also a collective phenomenon of different origin that develops in the particle - hole continuum of the the inter - orbital channel within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . due to the lack of a fs in the hg - o band , we assume this band to be non - sc in this single layer hg1201 case . including all these realistic effects </S>",
