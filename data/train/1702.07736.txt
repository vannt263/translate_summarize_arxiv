    ", these clouds play important roles in the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "however , much is still not known about irdc formation and evolution .",
    "one open problem is the unknown role of magnetic ( b ) fields in the formation of irdcs and any potential star formation they host .    while many studies have probed the b - fields of molecular clouds using techniques such as the zeeman effect , background starlight polarimetry , and dust emission polarimetry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , studies of the b - fields of irdcs have mainly focused on the small size scales of cores and clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several studies have probed the interstellar medium ( ism ) between clouds @xcite , but few have probed the cloud scales ( 10s of pc ) to study the interaction between the b - field and an irdc as a whole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to test whether b - fields play a dominant role in irdc and massive star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or are themselves influenced by more dominant forces ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as turbulence or gravity , b - field properties must be observationally related to other physical cloud properties .",
    "for example , the preferential direction of b - fields relative to cloud orientation can reveal whether material flowed along field lines to create clouds .",
    "if the field is more likely found to be either perpendicular or parallel to the cloud orientation , then the b - field very likely played a role in the cloud s formation @xcite .",
    "other tests rely on the relative strength of the b - field .",
    "the relative strength of the gravitational potential compared to the local b - field (  mass - to - flux  ratio , m/@xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of a clump reveals the importance of the b - field compared to gravity .",
    "additionally , if the power - law dependence of the b - field strength on cloud gas volume density is shallower than 2/3 , the field likely influenced the flow of material cloud formation @xcite .",
    "near - infrared ( nir ) background starlight polarimetry provides a way to probe the b - field on scales of @xmath41 to tens of pc at the distances to most irdcs .",
    "the polarization signal is caused by aspherical dust grains spinning with their long axes aligned mostly perpendicular to the intervening b - field @xcite .",
    "the linear polarization signal imparted on background starlight by the asymmetric dichroic extinction of the dust grains follows the orientation of the b - field in the plane of the sky .",
    "therefore , the orientations of the nir polarizations trace the plane - of - sky b - field .",
    "nir polarimetry can reveal the plane - of - sky b - field morphology over large fields of view and wide ranges of column and volume densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the plane - of - sky b - field strength can often be inferred by using the chandrasekhar - fermi method ( * ? ? ? * hereafter cf method ) , which combines the polarization measurements with complementary cloud density and gas velocity information .      in this study , we the plane - of - sky b - field toward irdc ( @xmath9 = 28@xmath1023 , @xmath11 = @xmath120@xmath1019 ; * ? ? ? * ) , using nir polarimetric observations , to determine role in the formation of the irdc .",

    "hosts one of the most massive quiescent cores found in an irdc , and is a likely candidate to host future high - mass star formation .",
    "because of its quiescent nature , g28.23 is an ideal laboratory in which to study the interaction between      we pursued answers to four questions regarding the plane - of - sky b - field , as revealed by deep nir observations , to ascertain the field s importance in the formation of g28.23 .",

    "is the plane - of - sky b - field preferentially aligned with the orientation of g28.23 ?",
    "because the angle of the cloud major axis orientation with respect to plane of the sky is not known , we will use the cloud elongation as a proxy for the cloud s major axis . if the b - field is perpendicular or parallel to the cloud , then likely played a role in the cloud formation .",
    "otherwise , if the field is randomly oriented with respect to the cloud , the field likely did not strongly influence cloud formation .",
    "what is the power - law dependence between b - field strength and cloud volume density ?",
    "a weak b - field frozen into isotropically collapsing material would follow a power law of 2/3 @xcite , .",

    "the distinct relative pa distributions found in different locations around the cloud indicate that the b - field morphology in the region is affected by the presence of the cloud .",
    "the dependence of the b - field strength on cloud density was fit with a power law .",
    "the index of the best - fitting power law was 0.73@xmath150.06 , the slope of 2/3 that would imply that the b - field was not dynamically important in the formation of the irdc .",
    "the relation between m@xmath64/@xmath65  and density , fit with a power law , indicates that the cloud is magnetically dominated at lower densities and becomes gravitationally dominated at higher densities .",
    "applying a correction factor to m@xmath64/@xmath65  to account for the unknown geometry of the system shows that the m/@xmath61  vs. density relation crosses unity in the density range @xmath4300700  h  @xmath45 .    based on the b - field properties found by nir polarimetry the formation of irdc g28.23 .",
