    "it is generally believed that the strong , broad emission lines which characterise quasar spectra are generated in gas photoionised by the central continuum source . while this implies an intimate relationship between the lines and the sed",
    ", many years of study have failed to conclusively establish such relations .",
    "indeed there is a general dichotomy between our qualitative viewpoints of the emission lines and seds of quasars which belies a strong relation between the two .",
    "the emission lines are thought to be similar from object to object , and a single - zone model for the broad emission line region ( belr ) was used with success for many years ( netzer 1990 ) . in contrast",
    "the seds , including the ionising uv - soft x - ray continuum , vary a good deal from one object to another ( elvis  1994 ) .",
    "possible explanations for this dichotomy include :    * the belr gas sees the primary continuum , which has a fairly constant shape , while our view is dominated by reprocessing in regions of the quasar exterior to the belr as well as along the line of sight . *",
    "a quasar s continuum is anisotropic so that the belr sees a different continuum from that seen by us . *",
    "our viewpoints on the emission lines and seds of quasars are incomplete and dominated by selection effects .",
    "* there exists a balance between the belr gas and the continuum such that the prominent emission lines have a small range in relative strengths . *",
    "the emission lines are not emitted in photoionised gas .",
    "our sample of 43 quasars with complete sed and emission line information allows us to address these possibilities .",
    "here we present preliminary results using standard single - band luminosities and slopes .",
    "our sample consists of 43 quasars observed by the _ einstein _ x - ray satellite with sufficient counts to define the x - ray spectral shape .",
    "it is a heterogeneous sample , about half of which is radio - loud , and is biased toward objects with relatively strong x - ray emission .",
    "the multi - wavelength observations of the sample are described in detail in elvis ( 1994 ) .    for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "ultra - violet ( uv ) spectra are taken from the lanzetta , turnshek & sandoval ( 1993 ) compilation of iue spectra of quasars .",
    "the optical spectra were obtained by ourselves on the mmt over the period 19851990 and will be presented in wilkes  ( in preparation ) .",
    "continuum luminosities ,  and  are taken from wilkes  ( 1994 ) , optical - uv slopes ( ) from kuhn ( 1996 ) and x - ray slopes ( ) from elvis  ( 1994 ) and wilkes & elvis ( 1987 ) .",
    "the uv and optical spectra were measured using automated routines described in green ( 1996 ) .",
    "no deconvolution of heavily blended features was attempted .",
    "we investigated the relation between the equivalent ( ew ) width of all the prominent uv and optical emission lines and the gross continuum parameters : , , , , . in order to avoid biases introduced by weak or non - detected lines , we use survival analysis techniques to include upper limits .",
    "we applied the following tests for a significant correlation using the asurv package ( lavalley , isobe & feigelson 1992 ) : cox proportional hazard model , generalised kendall s tau , spearman s rho .",
    "the average probabilities of a chance correlation derived from the results of these tests are presented in table 1 .",
    "values @xmath0 are considered significant .",
    "we find no correlation between the emission line ews and the slopes of either the x - ray or optical - uv continuum .",
    "we find significant correlations between  and the uv lines + nv , ovi+  and civ but not with ciii ] , mgii or the balmer lines .",
    "correlations with the continuum luminosities are seen for all lines except civ .",
    "the traditional baldwin effect ( ew inversely related to , baldwin 1977 ) is the primary correlation for + nv , mgii and the balmer lines while a similar correlation with  is primary for ciii ] and feii@xmath14570 .",
    "ovi+  has too few data points ( 14 , including 8 upper limits ) to assess the correlations .",
    "similar results have been reported by green ( 1996 ) , zheng , kriss & davidson ( 1995 ) and corbin & boroson ( 1996 ) respectively .",

    "the final column of table 1 indicates , very roughly , the spectral region to which a line / blend is sensitive according to krolik & kallman ( 1988 ) .",
    "we define the divide between optical ( o ) and x - ray ( x ) to be 0.01 ev , and find that , with the exception of the feii feature , the ew ",
    "luminosity inverse correlation is weaker with respect to the luminosity defined closer to the ionising continuum for that line .",
    "this confirms a similar result found by green ( 1996 ) for a largely different sample of quasars and implies that the ionising continuum is indeed important in determining the strength of an emission line . a more detailed investigation , including continuum luminosities defined over narrower continuum bands , is likely to provide information on the nature of this continuum in each case .",
    "these results argue against a purely geometric explanation for the baldwin effect ( eg .",
    "netzer 1987 ) and in favour of scenarios involving variations in the shape of the sed ( eg .",
    "mushotzky & ferland 1984 ) .",
    "feii@xmath14570 is a notable exception to this general trend .",
    "it is believed to originate in x - ray heated gas deep inside the belr clouds and so should be sensitive to hard x - rays , although photoionisation models generally under - predict the line strengths , calling their results into question . a relation between the soft x - ray slope and the feii equivalent width , such that softer sources have stronger feii , in contrast to photoionisation model predictions , has been debated for a number of years ( bergeron & kunth 1984 , wilkes , elvis & mchardy 1987 , boroson 1989 , zheng & obrien 1990 ) .",
    "recent studies have suggested a complex set of relations which also include line width and the strength of [ oiii]@xmath15007 ( boroson & green 1992 , laor  1994 & 1996 , boller  1996 , lawrence  1996 ) .",
    "the presence of an inverse ew(feii)correlation , which perhaps suggests that the x - rays are not responsible for generating feii , along with the absence of a simple feii  correlation in the current sample is intriguing and will be followed up in more detail .",
