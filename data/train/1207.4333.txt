    "the voter model ( vm ) @xcite is a paradigm of coarsening phenomena @xcite that stands as one of the most interesting models in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the nature of its interest is twofold : on the one hand , it represents one of the few nontrivial non - equilibrium statistical processes that can be exactly solved in any number of dimensions @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has a natural application in social dynamics @xcite as a model for the formation of opinion consensus in a society initially divided in two different standpoints .",
    "the appeal of the vm is further enhanced by its connection with neutral models in genetics , ecology and linguistics  @xcite .",
    "its definition is very simple : on a regular lattice or graph , each site is endowed with a binary variable @xmath2 . at each time step , a randomly chosen site copies the state of one of its nearest neighbors , chosen in its turn at random .",
    "this parameter - free dynamics can be succinctly encoded in the _ flipping probability _",
    "@xmath3 , measuring the probability that spin @xmath4 will flip if surrounded by a fraction @xmath5 of spins in the opposite state , which takes the simple linear form @xmath6 . for this reason we will refer to it in the following as the _ linear _ voter model .",
    "voter dynamics is thus characterized by the presence of two absorbing states ( all spins either @xmath7 or @xmath8 , the _ consensus _ states ) with a @xmath9 spin reversal symmetry . moreover , since the rate of creation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 spins is equal , the magnetization is conserved in average .",
    "the way in which consensus is reached in the vm can be characterized from different perspectives . from the point of view of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ,",
    "the coarsening process in the vm is marked by the absence of surface tension @xcite causing an anomalous logarithmic decay of the density of interfaces in @xmath10 , namely @xmath11 , in opposition to curvature - driven dynamics @xcite , which leads to an algebraic decay @xmath12 . in the social dynamics context ,",
    "on the other hand , interest is focused on the exit probability @xmath13  @xcite ( defined as the probability that the final state corresponds to all sites in state @xmath7 ) and the consensus time @xmath1 ( the average time needed to reach consensus in a system of size @xmath14 ) when starting from fully random initial conditions with a fraction @xmath0 of sites in state @xmath7 .",
    "conservation of magnetization implies a characteristic linear exit probability , @xmath15 , in any dimension @xmath16 @xcite , while the consensus time takes the form , for @xmath17 , @xcite @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is an effective factor depending on the number of sites @xmath14 and dimensionality @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis revealed that vm actually lies at the transition point between a ferromagnetic ( ordered ) and a paramagnetic ( disordered ) phase , such that infinitesimally small perturbations are able to drastically change its behavior @xcite .",
    "the parameter - free nature of the vm thus led naturally to the question as whether it represents a peculiar and isolated point , or rather belongs to a more general ( universal ) class of models , sharing the same properties .",
    "this issue has been answered by dornic and coworkers @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , who have pointed out the existence of a genuine generalized voter ( gv ) universality class , encompassing systems at an order - disorder transition driven only by interfacial noise , between two `` dynamically equivalent '' absorbing states .",
    "the dynamical equivalence between states can be enforced either by @xmath9-symmetric local rules , or by global conservation of the magnetization .",
    "the linear voter model possesses both properties , but each of them separately is sufficient to ensure gv behavior .",
    "the gv class is characterized in @xmath10 by the logarithmic decay of the density of interfaces coincides with the zero temperature glauber dynamics @xcite , while it is described by mean - field theory for @xmath20 , its upper critical dimension .",
    "the interest of its definition and properties is thus essentially given by the behavior in @xmath10 .",
    "] as well as by other critical exponents  @xcite . in this generalized perspective",
    ", the gv transition for @xmath9-symmetric models can be theoretically rationalized as the superposition of two independent transitions @xcite , an ising transition and a directed percolation @xcite transition , whose respective symmetries are broken in unison at the gv manifold .",
    "these @xmath9-symmetric models are also called _ nonlinear _ voter models , because at the transition the flipping probability @xmath3 assumes a nonlinear form .    by means of extensive numerical simulations performed for three representative models , in this paper",
    "we show that , while the gv class is well - defined in two dimensions in terms of the decay of the density of interfaces and the value of a set of the critical exponents , it also exhibits non - universal properties which depend on the microscopic details of the respective models definitions .",
    "the non - universality of the gv class is explicitly observed in the exit probability and the consensus time , which deviate from the linear and entropic form [ eq .",
    "] , respectively , observed in the linear voter model . in this respect , it is worth noticing that nontrivial shapes of the exit probability had previously been found for models in @xmath21 or at the mean - field level .",
    "here we show for the first time that @xmath13 can also be nontrivial in two - dimensional systems .",
    "we have considered in particular three models representing the whole spectrum of gv class , namely the nonlinear voter model ( nlv ) originally devised to explore the gv manifold @xcite ; the recently proposed non - linear @xmath22-voter model ( qv ) @xcite ; and the kaya , kabakiolu , and erzan ( kke ) model  @xcite .",
    "the first two models are @xmath9-symmetric , while in the third the dynamical equivalence between absorbing states is enforced by global conservation of magnetization .",
    "numerical simulations in the vicinity of the critical point confirm the existence of the gv universality class . in particular ,",
    "measuring the exponents related to the fluctuations of the magnetization and the correlation length when approaching the critical point from the disordered and ordered phases , respectively , suggest non mean - field exponents , at odds with the claim made in ref .",
    "however , when probing the behavior of the models for unbalanced initial conditions ( @xmath23 ) by means of the dependence of the exit probability and of the consensus time on @xmath0 , we observe that the originally defined gv class exhibits strong non - universal features , represented by an exit probability and the consensus time that can depend on further microscopic details of the models undergoing the gv transition . in particular , we observe that models in which conservation of average magnetization is strictly enforced , such as the kke model , have indeed a linear @xmath13 as the vm , but they exhibit a consensus time @xmath1 different from the entropic form eq .  . on the other hand , models which exhibit @xmath9-symmetry , such as the nlv and the qv models , display @xmath13 and @xmath1 both departing from the linear vm behavior .",
    "the non - linearity of the exit probability can be rationalized by inspecting the behavior of the average magnetization over time . here",
    "we can see that magnetization is not conserved over short time scales , but it increases initially in the nlv model , while it decreases in the qv model .",
    "this transient behavior can be traced back to the presence of strong non - zero drift in the initial dynamical evolution starting from @xmath24 .",
    "after this initial drift has vanished , the average magnetization remains constant and the ensuing evolution is well described by a linear voter dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : gener - voter - class ] we present the results of numerical simulations for the class of non - linear voter models , determining the values of the critical exponents and showing the nontrivial @xmath0 dependence of the exit probability and of the consensus time . in section  [ sec : q - voter - model ] we do the same for the @xmath22-voter model , while section  [ sec : kaya - kabakc - ciov ] is devoted to the kke model .",
    "the final section summarizes the results and discusses their relevance .",
    "the characteristics of the gv class were exposed in ref .",
    "@xcite by numerical examination of a @xmath9-symmetric non - linear voter model ( nlv ) defined it terms of a kinetic ising model as follows : we consider a binary spin system in @xmath10 , in which the probability @xmath25 that a spin @xmath26 flips depends on its value and the value of the local field @xmath27 it feels .",
    "the @xmath9 symmetry imposes @xmath28 ; therefore all flipping probabilities can be encoded in the flipping probability for a @xmath29 spin , @xmath30 .",
    "the absence of bulk noise imposes @xmath31 .",

    ", we first check the results of ref .",
    "@xcite by numerically evaluating its critical gv point , and estimating the value of the corresponding critical exponents .",
    "the critical point can be estimated by monitoring the density of interfaces @xmath44 and identifying @xmath41 as the value leading to a logarithmic decay @xmath11 , separating a constant behavior ( @xmath45 ) from an algebraic decay ( @xmath46 )  @xcite . here",

    "nontrivial shapes were previously found only in @xmath21  @xcite and in mean - field , but not in @xmath10 . finally , our numerical estimates of the critical exponents associated to the gv transition suggest a value of the @xmath74 exponent possibly different from the mean - field value previously supposed to hold . further research work is needed to fully clarify this issue , based on numerical simulations on systems sizes beyond those used in the present work , which are at the boundary of our computational limits .",
