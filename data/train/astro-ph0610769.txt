    "the global three - dimensional ( 3d ) structure of the milky way galaxy is one of the essential informations to study the galactic objects in detail . in paper",
    "i @xcite , we have analyzed the latest 21-cm line survey data , and presented the 3d distribution map of h i gas in the milky way galaxy . in this paper",
    ", we deal with the molecular gas distribution as part ii of this series .",
    "a survey in the @xmath0co(@xmath110 ) line is a good tool for tracing the interstellar matter ( ism ) in the inner disk of the milky way galaxy ( inside the solar orbit ) , while the h i data is advantageous for study of ism in the outer disk ( outside the solar orbit ) .",
    "one of the most famous co line surveys is the columbia co survey , whose earlier survey was carried out with the @xmath4-m telescopes in new york city , usa , and cerro tololo , chile @xcite .",
    "this survey covered the entire milky way with a grid spacing of @xmath5 .",
    "another higher resolution survey is the massachusetts  stony brook galactic plane co survey , which was made using the 14-m telescope of the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) @xcite .",
    "the covered ranges of the galactic longitude and latitude were from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in the first quadrant , respectively .",
    "the grid spacing was @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "these large co surveys were ideal for exploring into the molecular gas distribution in the milky way galaxy .",
    "there have been several studies on the galactic structure using these data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed face - on views of the first galactic quadrant examining positions of the largest individual molecular complexes identified in the columbia co survey of the first galactic quadrant @xcite .",
    "they found clear evidence for the sagittarius spiral arm .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed distribution of giant molecular clouds in the fourth quadrant and they clearly delineated the carina arm .",
    "@xcite presented the molecular gas distribution in the first quadrant of the inner disk of the milky way galaxy using the massachusetts ",
    "stoneybrook co survey , found a ring - like structure at the radius of @xmath12 ( @xmath2 : the galactocentric distance of the sun ) , and traced the sagittarius and perseus arms .",
    "the distance of the molecular gas was determined by the kinematic distance using a rotation curve . the near  far problem in the inner galaxy",
    "was overcome by introducing a vertical model of the molecular gas distribution .",
    "@xcite showed a face - on view of the milky way galaxy examining individual giant molecular clouds identified in the massachusetts - stoneybrook co survey .",
    "@xcite presented the molecular gas distributions in the entire galactic disk of the milky way galaxy using the columbia survey @xcite for modeling the diffuse gamma - ray emission .",
    "the distance of the molecular gas was determined by the kinematic distance .",
    "although there is a near  far problem in the inner disk , they * divided * gas density equally at near and far points for @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite determined the molecular gas distribution in the galactic center by considering the absorption of the oh line to determine the line - of - sight distance of the molecular gas , using the co data cube of @xcite .",
    "they found that molecular gas is elongated in the line - of - sight direction against the sun , and that this feature is associated with a central galactic bar .",
    "thus , there are several studies on the molecular gas distribution .",
    "however , there has been no three - dimensional gas density map of the whole galaxy . @xcite",
    "published a new compilation of columbia @xmath0co(@xmath110 ) survey of the whole of the milky way galaxy . the sampling and the sensitivity of this survey",
    "were much improved over that of the old columbia survey .",
    "this is a great tool for investigating the molecular gas distribution throughout the entire milky way galaxy . in this paper , we show a molecular gas distribution in the milky way galaxy using the columbia @xmath0co(@xmath110 ) survey data and the latest rotation curve .",
    "we used the latest compilation of @xmath0co(@xmath110 ) survey data @xcite , which were obtained with the 1.2-m telescopes in new york city , usa , and cerro tololo , chile .",
    "the half - power beam width ( hpbw ) was @xmath14 , which corresponded to 2.4 pc at the heliocentric distance of 1 kpc .",
    "the data consisted of @xmath0co(@xmath110 ) line spectra over the entire milky way .",
    "we used data of surveys named 2 , 8 , 18 , 31 , 33 , and 36 .",
    "grid spacing of these data was @xmath15  @xmath16 . the total radial velocity ( @xmath17 ) coverage was 332 km s@xmath18 and velocity resolution was @xmath19 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the r.m.s . noise level per channel was 0.12  0.43 k. we used spectra within a galactic latitude range of @xmath20 .",
    "the rotation curve , which we used to transform the radial velocity of the co gas into the distance , is the same as we used in paper i. the inner and outer rotation curves are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the galactic constants @xmath21 kpc ( the galactocentric distance of the sun ) and @xmath22 km s@xmath18 ( the solar rotational velocity ) are adopted .",
    "for the inner galaxy , we averaged the co data over five channels ( @xmath23 km s@xmath18 velocity width ) for each spectrum in order to eliminate the cloud - cloud motion of 3  3.9 km s@xmath18@xcite and to obtain a higher signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ratio ) .",
    "the molecular gas is distributed in a more clumpy form than the h i gas .",
    "since we intend to develop our understanding of the global structure of the milky way galaxy , we must smooth the co emission on a larger scale in order to eliminate such a clumpy features and to model the vertical structure of the molecular gas disk . since the typical scale of the random motion of the molecular clouds is @xmath24 kpc @xcite , we averaged the data over a 240 pc width when the line - of - sight length corresponding to 6.5 km s@xmath18 velocity width was smaller than 240 pc .",
    "thus the co data were averaged over @xmath23 km s@xmath18 velocity width and @xmath25 pc width .",
    "in addition , we averaged the data in the longitudinal direction to eliminate the clumpy features of co clouds and to obtain a much higher s / n ratio .",
    "for the first ( @xmath26 ) and fourth ( @xmath27 ) quadrants , we bound the data , so that the longitudinal width at the tangential point is equal to 240 pc - width .",
    "thus the co data were averaged over @xmath28 pc in the line - of - sight direction and longitudinal direction except for the inner region of the tangential radius , where the data were averaged over @xmath28 pc width only in the line - of - sight direction .",
    "the data were not averaged in the latitudinal direction at all .      for the outer galaxy , we averaged the data in the longitudinal direction so that longitudinal separation becomes @xmath5 , which is nearly the same as the h i data .",
    "moreover , we averaged the co data over two channels ( @xmath29 km s@xmath18 velocity width ) , which is also the same as the h i data .",
    "figure [ cal - point ] shows the points where the molecular gas densities were calculated .      in this paper , we choose a cartesian coordinate whose @xmath30axis coincides with the line crossing the sun and the galactic center and whose origin coincides with the galactic center .",
    "the @xmath31-axis is chosen so that it is parallel to the rotational axis .",
    "the sun is located at @xmath32 .",
    "we also choose a cylindrical coordinate @xmath33 so that the angle @xmath34 coincides with the direction toward the sun and the angle @xmath35 is parallel to @xmath36 .",
    "the distance of the molecular gas was determined by kinematic distance in this paper , the same way as in paper i. the distance of molecular gas in the outer disk @xmath37 is uniquely determined , and then we obtained the molecular gas distribution in the outer disk using the equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the volume number density of the molecular hydrogen h@xmath40 , @xmath41 the co - to - h@xmath40 conversion factor , and @xmath42 the heliocentric distance .",
    "we adopted two kinds of conversion factor ; ( 1 ) a constant conversion factor of @xmath43 ( h@xmath40 @xmath44 k@xmath18 km@xmath18 s ) @xcite and ( 2 ) a varying conversion factor with the galactocentric distance @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated @xmath41 using the data in @xcite .",
    "since the conversion factor can be approximately expressed by exponential function of the galactocentric radius , we fitted an exponential function to the resultant radial profile and obtained the following equation , @xmath45 } = 1.4 \\exp{(r/11 { \\rm kpc})}.\\ ] ]      there is , on the other hand , a near - far ambiguity in the inner disk @xmath37 ; i.e. there are two heliocentric distances satisfying the same radial velocity .",
    "therefore , we could not determine the h@xmath40 distribution in the inner galaxy in the same way as in the outer galaxy . in order to divide molecular distributions at near and far points",
    ", we introduced the vertical structure of the galactic disk .",
    "following @xcite , we assumed that the vertical distribution of the molecular gas is expressed with @xmath46 where @xmath31 and @xmath47 denote the height from the galactic plane ( @xmath13 ) and the scale - height , respectively . at @xmath48 the density , @xmath49 ,",
    "gets a half value of the maximum at the midplane .",
    "the subscript @xmath50 means values at the midplane .",
    "the scale - height was determined at the tangential points in the inner galaxy , which is described in the next subsection .",
    "assuming that the vertical distribution of the h@xmath40 gas follows equation ( [ spi_eq ] ) , the h@xmath40 column density , @xmath51 , is represented as a function of the galactic latitude @xmath52 using four parameters : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "that is , @xmath57 where @xmath58    @xmath59    for each point shown in figure [ cal - point ] , we sought a parameter set consisting of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , which gives the smallest residual in subtracting the model distribution from the observation .",
    "the fitting resolution of the four parameters is 0.01 h@xmath40 @xmath60 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and 1 pc for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "we restricted @xmath55 and @xmath56 within a range of @xmath61 pc to @xmath62 pc .",
    "the grid spacing is @xmath15 , which corresponds @xmath63 pc at tangential points , at most points in the inner galaxy .",
    "since there are enough points ( more than three points ) to resolve near vertical distribution , it is possible to divide the total co emission into near and far emissions .",
    "we thus obtained parameter sets of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 for discrete points in the inner galaxy .    to show how well the fitting method works , we present a residual map in figure [ residualmap ] . in order to make this map , we first measured standard deviation of residuals between a fitted model curve and observed data . and then , we calculated relative residuals , which is a fraction of the standard deviation relative to the peak of the observational data .",
    "this residual map shows that the relative residual is less than 20  30 % in most of the region , and that the fitting method does not work well near the sun .",
    "tangential points which satisfy @xmath64 present no near - far problem in the inner galaxy .",
    "hence , the vertical structure at the tangential points can be determined uniquely .",
    "the gas of velocity range @xmath65 is located at the tangential points , where @xmath17 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are radial velocity , maximum radial velocity , and random velocity , respectively .",
    "the random velocity was taken to be 5 km s@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we thus obtained vertical distributions , and fitted a model distribution @xmath68 to determine a scale - height of @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ sh - co ] shows a full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) ( @xmath69 ) plotted versus the galactocentric radius , which is a mean value in a 1 kpc bin . for a comparison , figure [ sh - co ] shows also fwhm of molecular disk calculated by @xcite and @xcite , who use the same data that we use .",
    "we adopt the galactic constant @xmath2 of 8 kpc although @xcite and @xcite use @xmath2 of 10 kpc .",
    "therefore , the radius and fwhm are reduced by factor of @xmath70 . filled squares , open circles , and open triangles",

    "a vertical distributions of molecular gas can be approximately reproduced by equation ( [ spi_eq ] ) .    ",
    "figure [ sh - co ]       we thus obtained parameter sets of the molecular distribution at each point of figure [ cal - point ] .    first , the parameter sets obtained for the discrete points in the inner galaxy were averaged with a gaussian function whose fwhm is 0.48 kpc , in order to eliminate data with bad fitting results .",
    "then we calculated the h@xmath40 distribution in the inner galaxy using the averaged parameter sets .",
    "the h@xmath40 gas densities obtained at the discrete points in the outer galaxy were transformed into continuous distribution by interpolating with the same gaussian function .",
    "averaging length for the @xmath31-direction was fixed at 35 pc , which corresponds to the grid spacing of @xmath16 at the heliocentric distance of 16 kpc . finally , we combined the h@xmath40 distributions in the inner and outer galaxy to obtain a co distribution cube . in this paper , the grid spacing of the cube",
    "is fixed at 200 pc for the @xmath30 and @xmath71 directions and at 20 pc for the @xmath31 directions , and the size of the resultant cube is 40 kpc @xmath72 40 kpc @xmath72 2 kpc in @xmath30 , @xmath71 , and @xmath31 direction , respectively .    since the number of points where the molecular gas densities were calculated ( figure [ cal - point ] ) in the azimuthal range @xmath73 is too few to make a map , we do not show this region .",

    "uncertainties concerning the location of the gas are about 1 kpc .",
    "second , we used the model expressed by equation ( [ spi_eq ] ) to divide the mixture emission from near and far points .",
    "though the resultant map can change due to the adopted function , the global feature is almost the same for any function as shown in paper i.    third , fitting method does not necessarily work .",
    "typical residual is less than 20  30 % of midplane density ( figure [ residualmap ] ) .",
    "however , residual becomes much larger near the sun , which implies that the fitting method does not work well in this region .",
    "fourth , conversion factor also affects the resultant gaseous map .",
    "we tried to make 3-d maps using a constant conversion factor and a varying conversion factor with the galactocentric distance .",
    "outer structure is enhanced when we use the varying conversion factor .",
    "we constructed a three - dimensional molecular gas map of the milky way galaxy using the new compilation data set of @xmath0co(@xmath110 ) survey obtained with 1.2-m telescopes and the latest rotation curve , based on the kinematic - distance .",
    "we made molecular gas maps by adopting two types of conversion factor ; one is constant , and the other varies with the galactocentric distance .",
    "global features are the same for both though the contrast is slightly different .      1 .",
    "the radial distribution of the molecular gas surface density has double peaks at the center and at the radius of @xmath137 , which is a feature similar to barred spiral galaxies . 2 .",
    "the fwhm of the molecular disk slightly increases from 48 pc to 160 pc with the galactocentric distance within the radius range of 011 kpc .",
    "3 .   there is a midplane displacement , whose amplitude is nearly constant inside the radius of 10 kpc , increasing beyond this radius .",
    "the ridges of midplane displacement form leading spiral arms .",
    "molecular gas arms corresponding to the outer , the perseus , the sagittarius - carina , the scutum - crux , and the norma arms could be traced as logarithmic spiral arms with the pitch angle of @xmath3 .",
    "supposing that the pitch angles of the spiral arms are within this range , the norma can be identified as being the same as the outer arm .",
