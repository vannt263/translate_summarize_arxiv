    "one of the motivations for the quantization of cosmological models was that of avoiding the initial _ big bang _ singularity . since the pioneering work in quantum cosmology due to dewitt @xcite , workers in this field have been attempting to prove that quantum cosmological models entail only regular space - times .",
    "an important contribution to this issue was given by hartle and hawking @xcite , who proposed the _ no - boundary _ boundary condition , which selects only regular space - times to contribute to the wave - function of the universe , derived in the path integral formalism .",
    "therefore , by construction , the _ no - boundary _ wave - functions are everywhere regular and predict a non - singular initial state for the universe . using that boundary condition , in certain particular cases the _ no - boundary _ wave - function",
    "can be explicitly computed @xcite .",
    "another way by which one may compute the wave - function of the universe is by directly solving the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "the wave - function of the universe for some important models have been computed using this approach @xcite .",
    "we should mention another boundary condition , the _ tunelling _ boundary condition , proposed by vilenkin @xcite , to be imposed on solutions to the wheeler - dewitt equations .",
    "the _ tunelling _ wave - function was also shown to give rise to models free from the initial _ big bang _",
    "singularity @xcite .",
    "more recently , the absence of singularities in quantum cosmological models has been investigated by using the debroglie - bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite . in this interpretation",
    ", one may compute the dynamical trajectories for the quantum variables of the system .",
    "in particular , since for most of the quantum cosmological models one uses minisuperspaces @xcite , one computes , through the debroglie - bohm interpretation , the dynamical trajectories for the scale factor .",
    "then , for the great majority of cases studied so far , the scale factor never vanishes , which implies that the model has no initial singularities @xcite .",
    "although we shall restrict our attention to a model in quantum general relativity , it is important to mention that several works in loop quantum cosmology have also shown that the wave - function of the universe is free from initial singularities @xcite .",
    "several important theoretical results and predictions in quantum cosmology have been obtained with a negative cosmological constant . considering a subset of all four - dimensional spacetimes with constant negative curvature and compact space - like hypersurfaces , carlip and",
    "coworkers showed how to compute the sum over topologies leading to the _ no - boundary _ wave - function @xcite .",
    "these spacetimes are curved only due to the presence of a negative cosmological constant . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown how to obtain a vanishing cosmological constant as a prediction from the _ no - boundary _ wave - function and in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown how to obtain predictions about the topology of the universe from the _ no - boundary _ wave - function .",
    "we may also mention the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the wkb _ no - boundary _ wave - function of a homogeneous and isotropic universe with a negative cosmological constant was computed . due to the regularity condition imposed upon the space - times contributing to the _ no - boundary _ wave - function",
    ", it was shown that only a well defined , discrete spectrum for the cosmological constant is possible",
    ". it was also found that among the space - times contributing to wave function , there were two complex conjugate ones that showed a new type of signature change .",
    "it is important to mention that although recent observations point toward a positive cosmological constant , it is still possible that at the very early universe the cosmological constant be negative . besides that",
    ", we think it is important to understand more about such models which represent bound universes ( analogous to uni - dimensional atoms , in the present situation ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use the formalism of quantum cosmology in order to quantize three friedmann - robertson - walker models in the presence of a negative cosmological constant and radiation .",
    "the radiation is treated by means of the variational formalism developed by schutz @xcite .",
    "the models differ from each other by the constant curvature of their spatial sections , which may be positive , negative or zero .",
    "they give rise to wheeler - dewitt equations for the scale factor , which have the form of the schrdinger equation for the quartic anharmonic oscillator .",
    "we find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of those equations by using a method first developed by chhajlany and malnev @xcite .",
    "then we use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets for each case and evaluate the expection value of the scale factors as a function of time . in sec .",
    "[ sec : classical ] we introduce the classical models and solve them analytically , briefly commenting on the general behavior of the classical solutions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantization ] we quantize the model by solving the corresponding wheeler - dewitt equation . the wave - functional depends on the scale factor @xmath0 and on the canonical variable associated to the fluid , which in the schutz variational formalism plays the role of time @xmath1 .",
    "we separate the wave - functional in two parts , one depending solely on the scale factor and the other depending only on the time .",
    "the solution in the time sector of the wheeler - dewitt equation is trivial , leading to imaginary exponentials of the type @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the system energy and @xmath4 .",
    "the scale factor sector of the wheeler - dewitt equation gives rise to the eigenvalue equation for the quartic anharmonic oscillator .",
    "we find semi - analytic solutions formed by the product of a decaying exponential term with a polynomial of fixed degree @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we construct wave packets from the eigenfunctions , for each case , and compute the time - dependent , expectation values of the scale factors .",
    "we find in all cases that the expection values of the scale factors show bounded oscillations .",
    "since the expectation values of the scale factors never vanish , we conclude that these models do not have singularities .",
    "we also observe that the energy levels depend on the value of the curvature constant @xmath5 of the spatial sections .",
    "the model with @xmath6 has the most bounded energy levels , followed by the one with @xmath7 ; the model with @xmath8 have less bounded energy levels . finally , in sec .",

    "the curvature is positive for @xmath13 , negative for @xmath14 and zero for @xmath7 . here",

    "this is justified because the universe is initially dominated by radiation .",
    "einstein s equations for the metric ( [ 1 ] ) and the energy momentum tensor ( [ 2 ] ) are equivalent to the hamilton equations generated by the super - hamiltonian constraint    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the momenta canonically conjugated to @xmath0 and @xmath1 the latter being the canonical variable associated to the fluid @xcite .",

    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) imply that the scale factor performs bounded oscillations , for all values of @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite is recovered .",
    "we wish to quantize the models following the dirac formalism for quantizing constrained systems @xcite .",
    "first we introduce a wave - function which is a function of the canonical variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 ,    @xmath38    then , we impose the appropriate commutators between the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 and their conjugate momenta @xmath39 and @xmath40 . working in the schrdinger picture , the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 are simply multiplication operators , while their conjugate momenta are represented by the differential operators @xmath41    finally , we demand that @xmath42 , the super - hamiltonian operator corresponding to ( [ 3 ] ) , annihilate the wave - function @xmath43 , which leads to wheeler - dewitt equation @xmath44 where the new variable @xmath45 has been introduced . in order to avoid possible countributions from boundary terms at spatial infinity , we shall consider compact tri - dimensional spatial sections in the cases @xmath7 and @xmath46    the operator @xmath47 is self - adjoint @xcite with respect to the internal product ,    @xmath48    if the wave functions are restricted to the set of those satisfying either @xmath49 or @xmath50 , where the prime @xmath51 means the partial derivative with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 9 ] ) is the schrdinger equation for the quartic anharmonic oscillator and may be solved by writing @xmath52 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 depends solely on @xmath0 .",

    "the extra term to be added to the effective potential ( [ 13 ] ) is proportional to @xmath58 . in terms of that new enlarged potential , the eigenvalue equation ( [ 12 ] )",

    "the method is based on the fact , shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the larger the degree of the polynomial @xmath66 , the smaller @xmath63 is .",

    "one important property of the method is that the convergence is very fast .",
    "this means that one does not need to use a polynomial of very large order to obtain a good agreement with the energies of anharmonic oscillators already computed in the literature by other methods .",
