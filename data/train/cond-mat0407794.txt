    "the taylor - chirikov map @xcite or standard map ( sm ) is one of the best known nonlinear models showing the onset of chaos in hamiltonian systems .",
    "it describes with some level of approximation many physical systems . among these",
    "there are numerous applications to plasma - physics , in which field it was originally introduced .",
    "the sm is also exactly related to the time evolution of the  kicked rotor \" and the equilibrium condition for a chain of masses superpositioned on a periodic potential .",
    "the latter is known as the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model .",
    "this model is of equally importance for solid state physics as the sm is for plasma physics .",
    "it has , e.g. , been applied to josephson junctions arrays , charge density waves and surface friction @xcite .",
    "more importantly , due to the simplicity and , yet , their complex behavior , these minimalistic models have had an enormous impact for our understanding in complex phenomena such as nonlinearity , chaos , quasi - periodicity , and commensurate - incommensurate transitions .",
    "although now part of any text - book in nonlinear physics and studied extensively over many years , the sm and fk still bear many unsolved problems . the most intriguing one of these is the sudden transition from smooth to chaotic orbits in the sm when the coupling parameter @xmath0 is increased above a critical value @xmath1 . in the fk model",
    "this transition is connected to change from a sliding to a pinned state and bears the name aubry- or _ breaking analyticity_- transition .    the theoretical framework that characterizes this transition originates from the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem @xcite that deals with the problem of small denominators that can occur in any perturbation expansion for quasi - integrable systems . in fact ,",
    "the kam theorem can be used to prove the non - chaotic behavior of the sm for very small coupling @xmath0 and sufficient irrational winding number @xmath2 .",
    "other arguments can then be applied to prove that a chaotic regime exists for values @xmath3 giving an upper bound to @xmath1 . for @xmath2",
    "equal to the golden mean , there exists an analytical bound by mather @xmath4",
    "@xcite , and the computer assisted proof of mackay and percival @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "moreover , another computer assisted analysis of jungreis excluded the value @xmath6 for possible occurrence of invariant circles ( smooth orbits )  @xcite .    there",
    "exist several methods to calculate @xmath1 precisely , among which greene s method  @xcite has shown to be one of the most effective giving the estimate @xmath7 .",
    "this method is based on the assumption that the dissolution of invariant curves can be associated with the sudden change from stability to instability of nearly closed orbits .",
    "the renormalization method of mackay  @xcite is a further refinement of this method and has established the same value with higher digit precision with respect to the original greene s result . yet",
    ", greene s hypothesis has only been partly proven .",
    "a result by falcolini and de la llave  @xcite asserts that the critical constants for symplectic maps can never be higher than the ones obtained by greene s method .",
    "recently , the result has been extended to nontwist maps by delshams and de la llave  @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath8 for the sm with the golden mean as winding number .",
    "another way to calculate @xmath1 is through the lindstedt series expansion .",
    "the smooth orbits in the sm can be described by a continuous ( analytic ) periodic function beneath @xmath1 .",
    "hence , below @xmath1 the fourier spectrum of this function should be finite for each component while decaying to zero in the high frequency domain . above @xmath1",
    "some divergence is expected : either infinitely high frequency components persist , or the amplitude of some components in the spectrum diverges , or both . by writing down the taylor expansion and equating the taylor orders in the functional equation satisfied by this conjugation function , the fourier - taylor components can , in principle , be derived from the ones of lower order . in ref .",
    "[ ] an evaluation of this expansion to high orders suggested a convergence to a value @xmath9 , which is higher than greene s result . in this article , we come back to this analysis and show that an apparent plausible assumption made in ref .",
    "[ ] is falsified beyond taylor order @xmath10 . as a result ,",
    "the lindstedt expansion does not contradict greene s result .",
    "the value @xmath9 , however , does correspond to the critical value for a different map , the semi - standard map ( ssm ) .",
    "we come back to this in sec .",
    "[ linser ] .",
    "aubry  @xcite proposed another method , that is probably not very effective for high precision evaluation in a computer algorithm , but still interesting .",
    "it is based on an eigenvalue calculation of the dynamical matrix for the fk chain close to the critical point .",
    "although this , in principle , requires the diagonalization of an infinite matrix , one can use the fact that the eigenvector of the lowest mode tends to localize  @xcite .",
    "the instability of the fk chain can than be determined in successive approximants by calculating the determinants of finite matrices of increasing length .",
    "finally we mention the use of pad approximants - pad approximation for a function @xmath11 is given by the ratio of two polynomials , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the simple taylor expansion of order @xmath15 can be considered as a special case of the pad series with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . ] to study numerically the entire analyticity domain .",
    "this is a powerful tool even if is it less precise than other methods for detecting the critical constant @xmath18 and not completely under control from a rigorous point of view .",
    "it has , for instance , been employed in ref .",

    "llave  @xcite developed a variant of greene s method working for complex values of the parameter @xmath0 that gives an alternative to the pad series approach .",
    "eventually , these approaches are assumed to converge to the same value .",
    "however , the proof of this is highly non - trivial .",
    "the ultimate goal , of course , would be to gain an analytical expression for @xmath1 .",
    "this is still far beyond our capabilities .",
    "inspired to investigate further the influence of the small denominators in the lindstedt series expansion , we introduce two simplified models by setting rigorously all the denominators equal to one both for the ssm and the sm . in the latter case , this is a very well known model , kepler s equation  @xcite , which turns out to have a very similar transition and can be solved analytically .",

    "the sm and ssm are defined as @xmath19 with @xmath20 the resulting sequence @xmath21 for @xmath22 originating from a starting point @xmath23 produces a discrete trajectory on a two - dimensional torus .",
    "such a trajectory for the sm can be related to the equilibrium positions of an infinite fk chain where particles with harmonic nearest neighbor coupling are placed on a periodic potential @xmath24 .",
    "the ssm has not such a similar counterpart , but is much simpler in its mathematics . by definition , @xmath25",
    "is called the winding number or rotation number of the map . for low coupling @xmath0 and @xmath2 incommensurate to the periodicity of @xmath26 , there exists a continuous function @xmath27 such that the positions @xmath28 can be expressed as @xmath29 this function is often called the conjugating function or , in context with the fk model , the modulation or hull function .",
    "the subscript @xmath2 indicates that the shape of the function depends on the rotation number .",
    "the conjugating function satisfies the functional equation @xmath30 for @xmath0 large enough the function @xmath31 becomes discontinuous . for the sm",
    "this implies that the orbits become chaotic and for the fk that the chain of particles gets pinned together with the appearance of a phonon gap .",
    "this transition , in context with the fk model , is also called analyticity breaking transition or aubry transition",
    ".    there are several quantities of interest which one can introduce in order to study the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics .",
    "as the function @xmath27 is analytic for @xmath0 close to the origin one can consider its series expansion in powers of @xmath0 @xmath32 and define the radius of convergence @xmath33 as @xmath34 } \\big ( \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty } \\left| g_{l}^{n}(x ) \\right|^{1/n } \\big)^{-1 } , \\label{roc}\\ ] ] where @xmath35}$ ] denotes the infimum or greatest lower bound in the domain @xmath36 $ ] for the quantity within the brackets @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the supremum limit giving the highest value for @xmath39 of all @xmath40 in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "note that the infimum appears in the definition of the radius of convergence because each invariant curve is filled densely by any trajectory lying on it as a result of the incommensurate winding number .",
    "hence , existence of the invariant curve itself requires the latter to be defined for all @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the critical constant @xmath42 is defined as the ( positive ) real value @xmath42 such that for @xmath43 the conjugating function is not analytic any more .",
    "such that for @xmath44 there is no more an analytic orbit , is that @xmath45 for the sm . ]",
    "it is believed that the analyticity domain of the conjugating function has a natural boundary : this means that @xmath46 , which is the modulation function @xmath47 at a value @xmath0 , has a set of singularities in terms of @xmath0 that form a closed curve around the origin in the complex plane .",

    "has @xmath49 , so that by estimating the radius of convergence one finds a lower bound for the critical constant .",
    "furthermore it is generally accepted that @xmath50 for the golden mean @xmath51 .. ] it is also commonly believed ( on the basis of numerical simulations and heuristic arguments ) that @xmath52 has the highest value for the golden mean @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , @xmath52 is assumed the same for all values @xmath54 , i.e. the values that can be written as @xmath55 with @xmath56 integer numbers .",
    "so far , the most accurate method to calculate @xmath1 is based on greene s method ( also known as residue criterion ) . in this method the infinite trajectory @xmath28 with irrational winding number @xmath2 is approached by successive approximants @xmath57 , which are periodic trajectories with rational winding numbers @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "these numbers can for instance be obtained using the continued fraction fraction expansion of @xmath2 . for @xmath63",

    ", the greene s method tells how to construct the periodic orbits and to measure their stability by means of the _ residue _ that does not tend to zero any more for @xmath68 .    besides only partly proven , greene s method has also some other limitations .",

    "the best general alternative is the lindstedt series expansion .",

    "in fact , it requires a stronger condition than irrationality such as a diophantine condition  @xcite . among all the irrational numbers , the golden mean @xmath53 suffers the least from the small denominator problem and has therefore the highest convergence radius @xmath1 .",
    "the golden mean is relatively difficult to approximate by rational numbers as those arising , for instance , from the continued fraction expansion ( one can say that it is the ` most irrational number ' ) .",
    "as addressed above , the best approximants for the golden mean are given by the fibonacci numbers : @xmath93 .",

    "for the golden mean the two values are equal as emerges numerically  @xcite , but for other values they can be appreciably different .",

    "what emerges is that the function @xmath254 has for each value of @xmath217 a pair of complex singularities closest to the origin symmetric with respect to the real axis .",
    "for @xmath217 going from @xmath255 to @xmath256 such singularities move continuously from @xmath257 to @xmath258 along two ( symmetric ) curves which pass through the points @xmath259 at @xmath260 ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",

    "an important feature is , however , that , as already noted in a similar context by simon  @xcite , a natural boundary in @xmath0 for fixed @xmath217 seems to appear only in the presence of small divisors .",

    "the assumption that allowed the restricted series  ( [ recssm ] ) was falsified for orders @xmath111 .",
    "the resulting critical constant did not correspond to the sm , but is still true for the ssm . from our numerics , we conclude that , for the golden mean , the ssm critical constant is strictly higher than the sm .",

    "still , the numerics till order @xmath91 do not give a complete convergence . an evaluation that would compare to the accuracy of greene s method",
    "would rely on an prohibitive computational effort .",

    "the fact , that the simplified model still has a transition with a value even lower than the true maps for the golden mean , shows that this is not the case .    finally , we studied the full analyticity domain for the two models . also here , there are striking differences between the simplified- and the true maps .",
    "similar to the true maps , the set of singularities form a natural boundary .",
    "however , whereas the sm and ssm all the singularities in @xmath0 for the function @xmath46 are present for any value of @xmath217 , the situation is different for the simplified maps .",
    "the simplified ssm has only one singularity in the complex @xmath0-plane for the function @xmath214 at each value of @xmath217 .",
    "the simplified sm has for each value of @xmath217 two singularities symmetric with respect to the real axis , except for the singularities on the real axis for @xmath265 and @xmath264 .",
    "the closed natural boundary is retained after gathering all singularities for all @xmath217 .",
    "this natural boundary is perfect circle in case of the simplified ssm , while it is more stretched curve for the simplified sm with a discontinuity on the real axis at @xmath261 .",
    "this shows that the radius of convergence of the simplified ssm equals its critical constant , like was found for the true maps with golden mean winding numbers .",
    "in contrast , the simplified sm has a critical constant of @xmath253 that is higher than its radius of convergence . in that respect ,",
    "the simplified sm resembles more the true sm with winding numbers close to rational values .",
    "also this is a bit of a surprise , as one would expect the contrary , but is consistent with the trend mentioned above .",
    "somehow , it is almost as if the model , in which all small divisors were eliminated , still suffers more from this effect that the sm with the golden mean .",
    "therefore , we believe that the study of these kind of simplified analytical models are a worthy prerequisite for the understanding of the sm , ssm and fk models and , in particular , the influence of the small denominators .    we thank alberto berretti for pointing out the relation between the simplified sm and kepler s equation .",
