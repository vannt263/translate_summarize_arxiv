    "the mass of supermassive black holes ( m@xmath1 ) is the key parameter in understanding the physics of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and the role of black holes in galaxy formation and evolution , as indicated in the local universe by the tight relations between m@xmath1 and host galaxy properties ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; magorrian et al . 1998 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; haring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "however , direct dynamical measurements of m@xmath1 using spatially resolved kinematics of stars and gas around the central black hole are limited to the local universe , where only about three dozen masses have been measured ( see kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ; tundo et al .",
    "2006 ) .    beyond the local universe",
    ", m@xmath1 can be estimated for active galaxies using the so - called `` virial '' method .",
    "the method assumes that the motion of the broad - line regions ( blr ) is dominated by the gravitational potential of the central source . under this assumption",
    ", m@xmath1 can be determined from the dynamics of the blr , provided that velocity and size are measurable , and that some assumption on the orbits is made in order to determine the virial coefficient .",
    "the velocity scale of the blr can be estimated from the width of broad - emission lines , while the size ( r@xmath2 ) can be measured using `` reverberation mapping '' ( blandford & mckee 1982 ) , i.e. determining the time lag between continuum changes ( presumably originating from an accretion flow ) and the corresponding changes in the broad - emission lines .",
    "the `` virial '' assumption has been directly tested for the best studied agn , ngc 5548 .",
    "time lags for ngc 5548 have been determined using several broad lines of different widths , and the inferred distance from the central source shows the expected `` virial '' correlation for a central point mass , @xmath3 ( peterson & wandel 2000 ) .    since the early attempts of determining the time lag between continuum and broad line light curves with cross - correlation methods ( e.g. gaskell & sparke 1986 ) and with more sophisticated response function calculations ( e.g. krolik & done 1995 ) , long - term efforts of reverberation mapping of the local seyfert galaxies ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ) and the low - redshift ( @xmath4 ) pg quasars ( kaspi et al . 2000 ) have provided clear detections of time lags for about three dozens of highly variable agns ( peterson et al .",
    "the measured time lags range from a few to @xmath5300 days and the nuclear optical luminosities range between 10@xmath6 and 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath8 . a m@xmath1 estimate",
    "is then obtained by combining the time - lags with measures of the width of the broad lines and a virial coefficient .",
    "the latter can be obtained for example by requiring that agns and their host galaxies follow the same m@xmath1-velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ; or bulge luminosity ) relation as quiescent galaxies ( onken et al .",
    "2004 ; greene & ho 2006 , labita et al .",
    "m@xmath1 estimates via reverberation mapping are believed to be accurate within a factor of @xmath53 ( bentz et al .",
    "2006b ; onken et al .",
    "2004 ; however , see krolik 2001 ) .",
    "reverberation mapping based masses have also provided a widely used empirical method to estimate m@xmath1 in distant agns from single - epoch data , bypassing the need for observationally expensive time series .",
    "this empirically calibrated photo - ionization method ( wandel et al .  1999 ) is based on the observed correlation between the blr size ( time lag ) and optical luminosity at 5100 .",
    "the slope of the power law relation r@xmath10 with @xmath11 is similar to that expected by photoionization models of the blr ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; bentz et al .",
    "this empirical relation has been widely used to determine m@xmath1 for large samples of broad - line agns , where long - term monitoring efforts would have been prohibitive ( e.g. woo & urry 2002 ; mclure et al .",
    "the uncertainty of m@xmath1 estimates based on this empirical relation is believed to be a factor of 3 - 4 ( vestergaard 2002 , 2006 ) , and it is due to several factors : i ) intrinsic uncertainties in the m@xmath1 of local calibrators ; ii ) intrinsic scatter of the size - luminosity relation ; iii ) differences between single - epoch measurements of optical luminosity and width , typically available for high - redshift studies , and those obtained from mean or rms spectra obtained from multiple epochs , generally used in the reverberation mapping analysis .",
    "determining m@xmath1 at high redshift is crucial to make progress in a number of outstanding scientific issues , e.g. , black hole demographics ( yu & tremaine 2002 ) , accretion mechanisms ( koratkar & blaes 1999 ) , connections between galaxy formation and evolution and agn feedback ( croton 2006 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ) , origin of the m@xmath1-@xmath9 and other scaling relations ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "studies of agn variability at high - redshift and possibly direct reverberation mapping determinations of time lags would be extremely valuable to validate the photoionization method and understand its uncertainty .",
    "however , reverberation mapping is challenging for bright quasars at high - redshift because it requires a longer time base line due to the time dilation @xmath12 effect .",
    "moreover , high luminosity objects ( l@xmath13 @xmath14 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath8 ) seem to have smaller amplitudes of continuum variability compared to seyfert galaxies ( variability amplitude - luminosity anticorrelation ; cristiani et al . 1997 ; vanden berk et al . 2004 ) .",
    "for example , after six year of monitoring , kaspi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) detected no variability of the ly@xmath15 line for 6 high - redshift ( z=2.2 - 3.2 ) quasars while they detected c iv @xmath161550 variability ( see also wilhite et al .",
    "these high luminosity quasars show a factor of two smaller continuum variability than that of the lower luminosity pg quasars monitored over a comparable rest - frame period .",
    "lower luminosity type-1 agns ( seyfert 1s ) , although fainter , provide several advantages from the point of view of a monitoring campaign .",
    "first and foremost the expected time lags are shorter ( order of weeks to a few months ) , raising the hopes of detecting a lag in only one season , without having to worry about objects observability .",
    "second , variability is expected to be more pronounced since the amplitude of variability seems to be anticorrelated with luminosity .    in this paper",
    "we report on our time - domain study of 13 moderate luminosity ( l@xmath13 @xmath5 10@xmath17 erg s@xmath8 ) agns at z @xmath50.36 .",
    "the campaign was carried out at the lick 3-m telescope from may 2004 to november 2004 .",
    "the sample is drawn from our sample of seyferts , for which stellar velocity dispersion ( treu , malkan & blandford 2004 ; woo et al .",
    "2006 ; hereafter tmb04 , w06 ) and bulge luminosity and radius ( treu et al .",
    "2006 in preparation ) have been determined from keck spectroscopy and hubble space telescope imaging in order to investigate the cosmic evolution of the m@xmath1-@xmath9 and m@xmath1-bulge luminosity relations .",
    "the goals of this paper are to : i ) study the variability of distant seyferts to explore the feasibility of reverberation mapping in the distant universe ; ii ) study the variability of the h@xmath0 line width to determine the contribution to the systematic uncertainty of the m@xmath1 estimated from single epoch spectra as opposed to rms or mean spectra .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in ",
    "2 we describe observations and data reduction . in   3 we describe continuum and line flux variability . in   4",
    "we compare line width measurements from single - epoch data . in   5",
    "we discuss our results and their implications .",
    "a standard cosmology is assumed where necessary ( h@xmath18=70 @xmath19mpc@xmath8 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "in order to increase our chances to detect a time lag in a single season , we focused our efforts on moderate luminosity agns , for which the time lag is predicted to be of order a few weeks in the rest frame , based on the size - luminosity relation ( kaspi et al .",
    "a continuos coverage is critical for a monitoring campaign , but the lick observatory does not offer service mode observations .",
    "thus , we decided to carry out our campaign over the summer months , when the typical weather patterns at mt .",
    "hamilton indicate that a relatively large fraction of time is useful for observations ( above 80% between june and september ) .",
    "note that this program does not require photometric conditions , nor particularly good seeing . of course , the drawback of observing in the summer is the short duration of the nights .",
    "given the expected time lags , we planned observations with weekly cadence ( corresponding approximately to 5 days in the rest frame ) . the mt .",
    "hamilton and lick observatory staff helped enormously by scheduling with regular cadence , except for the obviously longer gaps during full moon periods when the background was prohibitive for optical observations .",
    "the targets are drawn from a parent sample of 30 broad - line agns at z=0.365@xmath220.010 , initially selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 2 ( abazajian et al . 2004 ) to investigate the relation between m@xmath1 and their host galaxy properties ( for details of sample selection , see w06 ) .",
    "a subsample of 13 targets was selected based primarily on observability during the summer months , and secondarily on the availability of ancillary keck and hubble data ( table  1 ) .",
    "all observations were performed with the shane 3-m telescope at the lick observatory between may 10 and november 19 .",
    "table  2 shows the journal of observations .",
    "the weather was generally bad in may and after the end of september , effectively cutting our campaign to 4 months .",
    "a fraction of time was also lost to technical problems .",
    "when we could open the dome , observing conditions ranged from photometric to thick cirrus , with a typical seeing @xmath52  . in total ,",
    "more than 100 individual spectra and images were taken on 20 nights , allowing us to measure variability of continuum and line fluxes .",
    "we used the kast double spectrograph with the 600 line mm@xmath8 grism centered at @xmath5 4300   to obtain blue ( 3300 - 5500 ) spectra , and with the 600 line mm@xmath8 grating centered at @xmath5 7500   to obtain red spectra ( 6300 - 9100 ) .",
    "the pixel scale corresponds to 1.83 @xmath230@xmath248 in the blue and 2.32@xmath230@xmath248 in the red .",
    "the blue spectra cover the mgii line ( rest wavelength @xmath25 ) while the red spectra cover the h@xmath0 line ( rest wavelength 4861 ) and extend in most cases to the red to include the h@xmath15 line . with the 2@xmath26 wide slit , the spectral resolution ( gaussian dispersion ) measured from arc lines was @xmath5 180 km s@xmath8 around the mgii line and @xmath5 100 km s@xmath8 around the h@xmath0 line .",
    "typical exposure time for each object was 2700 - 3000 second or 2 @xmath23 1800 second , yielding s / n @xmath5 10 per pixel on the continuum of single - epoch spectra .    internal flat fields for the red spectra",
    "were obtained at each target position to correct pixel - to - pixel variation and the fringing pattern of the red ccd . for the blue spectra",
    ", internal flats were taken in the afternoon .",
    "a set of a0v stars  selected from the hipparcos catalog to be close in the sky to our targets  was used to correct the a and b - band atmospheric absorption features and to perform secondary flux calibration ( see tmb04 and w06 for details ) .",
    "spectrophotometric standards were observed for flux calibrations .    for spectroscopic target acquisition and to obtain broad band imaging time - series",
    ", we used the direct imaging capability of the kast spectrograph . before every spectroscopic exposure",
    ", we obtained images in the g and r bands over the unvignetted field of view of approximately 2 arcminute diameter ( 0.8 arcsec pixel@xmath8 ) .",
    "the field of view is large enough that for most objects at least a couple of stars brighter than the target agn were available for differential photometry .",
    "typical exposure time for imaging was 120 second on the red side with the r filter and 150 second on the blue side with the g filter .",
    "we performed the standard data reduction including flat fielding , wavelength calibration , spectral extraction , and flux calibration using a series of iraf scripts .",
    "cosmic rays were removed from each exposure using the laplacian cosmic - ray identification software ( van dokkum 2001 ) .",
    "sky emission lines were used for wavelength calibration in the red , supplemented by arc lamps in the blue .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted for maximal s / n with a typical extraction radius of 3 pixels , corresponding to @xmath5 4.8@xmath26 .",
    "thirteen low quality spectra with low s /",
    "n ( mostly due to bad weather ) or severe fringing effects ( due to imperfect flat - fielding ) were removed from the high quality sample to be analyzed for variability .",
    "the rest - frame mean and rms spectra for all 13 agns are shown in figure  1 , together with the average noise level .",
    "broad mgii , h@xmath0 , h@xmath15 and narrow oiii lines are clearly visible in all the average spectra . in most cases ,",
    "the h@xmath0 line is not visible in the rms spectra since the variation over the observed epochs is smaller than the average uncertainty per pixel .",
    "the h@xmath15 line is clearly visible in some of the rms spectra .",
    "variability is one of the main characteristics of agns , and is the property that is relied upon for reverberation mapping studies .",
    "however , the amplitude and the spectral shape change is not well studied for general seyfert galaxies and quasars . in this section ,",
    "we first present optical continuum variability (   [ ssec : contvar ] ) as determined by broad band g and r photometry , using available hst photometry to separate the variable nuclear component from the constant stellar component (   [ ssec : intnucvar ] ) .",
    "then , in   [ ssec : specvar ] , we study the h@xmath0 line flux variability from the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "we focus on the h@xmath0 line since this is the most commonly used line in this redshift range , and the proximity of the narrow oiii lines provides a robust relative spectrophotometric calibration .      in order to measure continuum variability , we performed differential photometry using stars in the field of each agn with both g and r band images .",
    "three to five stars around the target agn were typically used to estimate relative flux variations of the agn .",
    "we excluded stars at the edge of the images , where vignetting is problematic .",
    "aperture photometry of individual stars and agns was performed using the phot task in iraf , with a 3 pixel ( 2.4@xmath26 ) aperture radius for flux measurements and with an annulus between 8 and 12 pixels for sky subtraction .",
    "the optimal size of the aperture and sky subtraction annulus were determined based on extensive tests with images of various quality seeing .",
    "typical errors in the aperture photometry are 1 - 3% for the 17 - 18th magnitude reference stars .",
    "magnitude differences between agn and field stars were calculated and then normalized to zero by subtracting the mean difference over all observed epochs .",
    "photometric errors of the target agn and each star were added in quadrature , yielding total errors on differential photometry in the range 2 - 4% .",
    "normalized magnitude differences obtained with different stars are consistent within the errors , providing a good sanity check on the analysis .",
    "the final light curve and errors were produced by averaging normalized light curves and errors for individual reference stars .",
    "we measured the continuum flux variability for 7 objects , namely s04 , s05 , s06 , s24 , s27 , s40 , and s99 , with more than 5 epochs of reliable observations ( see fig . 2 , 3 and 4 ) .",
    "a continuum broad band light curve for s08 could not be obtained due to the lack of suitable reference stars in the field .",
    "the observed flux variability in the g band , corresponding to rest - frame wavelength 2800 - 4000 , is consistent with that of the r band ( rest - frame wavelength 4000 - 5200 ) , but with larger amplitude . in the g band ,",
    "peak - to - peak variation is 12 - 37% and rms variation is 2 - 10% while in the r band peak - to - peak variation is 9 - 32% and rms variation is 2 - 9% ( see table  3 ) .",
    "this amount of variability on week to month timescales is consistent with previous studies of local seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars ( e.g. webb & malkan 2000 ; klimek et al .",
    "2004 ) and high - redshift quasars ( kaspi et al . 2003 ) .      stellar light contributions from host galaxies to the total flux is often significant , especially for seyfert galaxies ( malkan & filippenko 1983 ; bentz et al .",
    "this leads to reduced variability in the integrated spectrum and hampers studying color variability of the nucleus ( hawkins 2003 ) .    to investigate nuclear flux and color variability , we need to correct for the host galaxy contamination",
    "this can be achieved using the agn - galaxy decomposition analysis obtained from hst - acs f775w ( i ) band images ( go-10216 ; pi treu ; treu et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) , and adopting our single - epoch measurement of the nuclear light fraction as our best estimate of the average nuclear light fraction .",
    "first , we derived the stellar fraction for the g and r bands using : @xmath27}.\\ ] ] here , f@xmath28 is the stellar fraction in each band , f@xmath29 is the stellar fraction in the i band determined from the hst imaging analysis , ( m - i)@xmath30 is the observed color from the sdss photometry ( dr4 ) , and ( m - i)@xmath31 is the stellar light color , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , as estimated from population synthesis models ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the stellar colors represents the spread obtained from models with ages ranging from 1 to 7 gyr and metallicities from 0.4 to 2.5 solar .",
    "then , we derived intrinsic flux variability by correcting the host galaxy contamination with : @xmath34 here , f is the stellar fraction in each band , r is the observed variability ( @xmath35 ) , and r@xmath36 is the corrected variability ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the mean correction on the variability of 6 objects with hst images is 0.016 magnitude in the g band and 0.057 magnitude in the r band . after correcting host galaxy contamination",
    ", we find 3 - 14% rms variation in the g band and 5 - 24% in the r band , somewhat larger in the red for a few objects ( see table 3 ) .",
    "figure 3 compares the continuum flux variability in the g and r bands with and without host galaxy correction .",
    "uncorrected flux variability shows higher amplitude in the g band than in the r band ( @xmath38 ) , as expected because stellar light dilution is more prominent in the red .",
    "however the variations become much more similar when the host galaxy contaminations are corrected for ( @xmath39 , where errors include a random component and a systematic error from uncertainties in stellar colors ) .",
    "this suggests that the spectral shape in the rest - frame 2800 - 5200   does not significantly change on weekly time scales , similar to the findings of wilhite et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that shows an ensemble quasar spectrum is bluer in bright phases only at rest wavelength @xmath40 2500 .",
    "the slightly redder colors in bright phases are probably caused by the lack of ( or much lower ) variability of emission lines , which are included in the wavelength coverage of the brodbands ( mgii in blue , and h@xmath0 and [ ] in red ) , because the relative emission line contribution to the continuum flux is lower in bright phases , producing redder photometric colors ( wilhite et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "emission line flux variability is more difficult to measure than continuum variability , since the uncertainty in the flux calibration of the ground - based spectroscopy is typically larger than  10% , particularly for faint sources . in the case of agns , however , narrow emission lines such as [ ] can be used as internal flux calibrators , since these lines originate from extended low - density regions  probably more than 100 times further from the accretion disk than the blr ( bennert et al .",
    "2006 )  and do not vary on short time scales as broad - emission lines do .",
    "thus , flux variations of broad lines can be measured by normalizing each spectrum to the constant narrow line fluxes , eliminating uncertainties related to slit loss effects , sky transparency , airmass correction , etc .",
    "an additional advantage of the specific case of the doublet [ ] @xmath414959,5007 is that the flux ratio between the two components does not vary ( bachall et al .",
    "2004 , dimitrijevi et al . 2007 ) and therefore the rms of the measured ratio provides a robust estimate of the residual uncertainties on the normalized flux .    for 8 objects ( s04 , s05 , s06 , s08 , s24 , s27 , s40 , s99 ) with more than 5 reliable single - epoch spectra , we measure h@xmath0 line flux variations using [ ] @xmath16 5007 line as an internal flux calibrator as described below ( the procedure is similar to that adopted by local reverberation mapping studies ,",
    "e.g. peterson et al .",
    "we also measure the [ ] @xmath16 4959 to [ ] @xmath16 5007 line ratio to help optimize the wavelength windows used for line flux determination doublet line flux ratio .",
    "the choice of the wavelength region for the h@xmath0 line is far less critical since the decline in s / n is more gradual and the spectrograph s pixels are small compared to the line width . ] .",
    "first , we subtract the continuum under h@xmath0 and [ ] lines using the average flux around 4700   and 5100   with @xmath5 50   windows .",
    "we linearly interpolate these two continuum points to define the underlying continuum .",
    "second , we measure the h@xmath0 and [ ] doublet line fluxes by integrating the flux over each line in the optimal windows .",
    "third , the h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath16 4959 fluxes are normalized by the [ ] @xmath16 5007 flux .",
    "before we can proceed to determine the intrinsic h@xmath0 line flux variability , we need to account for residual systematic errors in the line ratios ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we use the fact that the flux ratio of [ ] @xmath16 5007 and 4959 is constant to obtain a conservative estimate of @xmath42 .",
    "this is done by requiring that a constant ratio be an acceptable fit to the data as measured by the @xmath43 statistic : @xmath44^{2 } } \\over \\sigma(i)^{2 } + \\sigma_{sys}^{2 } } } = n-1.\\ ] ] here , r(i ) is the flux ratio between [ ] @xmath164959 and @xmath165007 at each observed epoch , @xmath45 is the error in the flux ratio , @xmath46 is the systematic error , and n is the number of observed epochs .",
    "the inferred systematic errors are in the range 215% .",
    "we note that this is likely to be an upper limit to the systematic errors as @xmath164959 is weaker than h@xmath0 , and narrow lines fluxes are more sensitive to uncertainties on wavelength calibration and to poor wavelength sampling than broad lines .    taking random and systematic errors into account",
    ", we can now estimate the h@xmath0 intrinsic line variability ( table 3 ) .",
    "we find rms variability in the range 313% .",
    "we caution that this should be considered a lower limit due to the fact that our estimate of systematic errors is conservative . for 3 objects we did not detect significant variability .",
    "we compare flux variations between continuum and the h@xmath0 line flux in figure 4 .",
    "the detected h@xmath0 line variability is smaller than the rms variations of the continuum flux ( a factor of 2 smaller on average after host galaxy correction ) , similar to other works ( e.g. rosenblatt & malkan 1992 ) .",
    "errors on the h@xmath0 flux measurements are larger than those on the continuum flux measurements because the s / n of the spectra is significantly lower than that of broad band images .",
    "the light curve of the h@xmath0 flux is qualitatively different from that of continuum flux , possibly indicating a time lag .",
    "however , we do not detect a clear lag between continuum and h@xmath0 light curves .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the time base line of our campaign is relatively short ( 4 months at maximum ) although the observed variation amplitude ( 5 - 10% on h@xmath0 ) is comparable to that of the time - lag measured samples in the literature . to illustrate this , in figure 5 we compared the monitoring time base lines in the rest - frame of each object with the variation amplitude for time - lag detected / undetected samples from the literature . in general a few hundred days of time",
    "base lines were required to detect a reliable lag . for high luminosity",
    "pg quasars , several years of base lines were used to get a time - lag . out of 3 objects in our sample ( open circles ) with the longest time base line ( @xmath5100 days in the rest - frame ) , one object does not show h@xmath0 variability while the other two objects show comparable variability as the seyfert galaxies with a time lag detection ( filled squares ) .",
    "in contrast , rest - frame time base line for our sample is at best in the borderline of the regime , where a reliable time lag can be measured , suggesting that we may detect a time lag if a factor of @xmath52 longer time base line can be provided .",
    "the blr velocity scale is one of the two ingredients in estimating virial m@xmath1 . in reverberation mapping m@xmath1 estimates ,",
    "the fwhm of balmer lines is generally measured from mean or rms spectra averaged over many observed epochs ( kaspi et al .",
    "in contrast , for most of m@xmath1 studies using the size - luminosity relation , relatively low s / n data from a single - epoch observation , e.g. sdss quasar spectra , are used .",
    "this could introduce additional uncertainty to virial m@xmath1 estimates , if the width of broad lines varies significantly or the random error on fwhm measurements on single - epoch data is significant . here , we investigate the uncertainty and variation of the h@xmath0 line width by comparing fwhm from a mean spectrum with that from each spectrum of various observed epochs .    the fwhm of the h@xmath0 line is measured in several steps .",
    "first , we subtract continuum under the h@xmath0 line by identifying the continuum levels of each side of the h@xmath0 line and interpolating between them .",
    "second , we subtract [ ] @xmath164959 by dividing [ ] @xmath165007 by 3 and blueshifting .",
    "third , we subtract the narrow component of h@xmath0 by rescaling [ ] @xmath165007 and blueshifting it . since the fwhm measurements are sensitive to the ratio of narrow h@xmath0 to [ ] ( up to @xmath510% ) , we used the fixed ratio determined from the high s / n keck spectra ( see table 3 ) .",
    "fourth , we fit the broad component of h@xmath0 with the gaussian - hermite polynomials up to 5 - 6 orders , depending on the asymmetry of the h@xmath0 line profile , and measure the fwhm of the model ( figure 6 ) .",
    "this is necessary because our single - epoch spectra have a typical s / n of 10 - 15 , too low to precisely define wavelengths at the half - maximum .",
    "figure 7 compares the h@xmath0 fwhm measured from mean spectra with that measured from each single - epoch data for 9 objects with more than 3 reliable spectra .",
    "s99 is excluded in this analysis since the h@xmath0 line has such a weak and very broad profile that we could not get meaningful measurements from single - epoch data . with 59 single - epoch data with s / n @xmath47",
    ", we find no systematic bias with an average ratio of @xmath48 between single - epoch fwhm and fwhm from mean spectra .",
    "the rms scatter around fwhm from mean spectra is @xmath5 14% , similar to 15 - 20% scatter found by vestergaard ( 2002 ) , who compared one single - epoch fwhm with fwhm from mean spectra for each of 18 agns .",
    "this scatter is a combination of actual width variation over monthly timescales , and random and systematic errors on single - epoch measurements .",
    "for example , rosenblatt et al . (",
    "1992 ) measured h@xmath0 fwhm using 12 single - epoch spectra for 12 local seyfert galaxies and found 7 - 26% rms scatter ( mean rms scatter 15% ) , which were comparable to their fwhm measurement uncertainty .    to understand intrinsic width variation and measurement errors",
    ", we measured h@xmath0 fwhm for 8 objects ( filled squares ) , for which high s / n ( 50 - 100 ) keck single - epoch data are available ( w06 ) .",
    "the random errors on the fwhm measurements from the keck spectra are virtually negligible .",
    "the rms scatter between the h@xmath0 fwhm from lick mean spectra and that from keck single - epoch spectra is 7% ( figure 7 ) .",
    "we note that this width variation is much smaller than continuum flux variation as expected from the size - luminosity relation in which log fwhm scales with 1/4 @xmath23 log l for given m@xmath1 .",
    "if we take this scatter as a measure of the intrinsic width variability , then we can consider errors on the lick single - epoch fwhm to be 12% ( 0.05 dex ) , by subtracting 7% ( 0.03 dex ) variation from 14% ( 0.057 dex ) scatter in quadrature .",
    "thus , most of the variation in the single - epoch fwhm measurements seems to be caused by the measurement uncertainty .",
    "consequently , we do not find any correlation between variations in fwhm and continuum or line flux since any intrinsic trend is swamped by measurement errors . if we take 14% scatter as the uncertainty on fwhm measurements , the propagated error in m@xmath1 estimates based on single - epoch data is 30% .",
    "this estimate should be applied with caution to other single - epoch data sets since the 30% propagated error may not be relevant because of the difference in s / n , the method of fwhm determination , variability , and other factors .",
    "we detected variability of moderate luminosity ( @xmath49 erg s@xmath8 ) agns at z=0.36 .",
    "continuum flux variability in the rest - frame wavelength 2800 - 4000   and 4000 - 5200   is detected at the 2 - 10% level ( rms variation ) .",
    "these measurements are consistent with other variability studies of local seyfert galaxies and higher redshift quasars ( e.g. webb & malkan 2000 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) . after correcting for stellar light contamination using hst - acs images , we find that the intrinsic nuclear continuum variability is 3 - 25% .",
    "blue and red continuum variability correlates , indicating that the spectral shape does not significantly change on weekly time scales .",
    "we also detected intrinsic h@xmath0 line flux variability at the level of 3 - 13% , on average a factor of 2 lower than the continuum flux variability .",
    "light curves of the continuum flux and the h@xmath0 line flux are qualitatively different , perhaps due to a time lag",
    ". however , the time base line of our campaign seems to be too short to detect a reliable lag .",
    "we may detect a time lag if a longer time base line can be provided . with modern scheduling techniques and perhaps a robotic telescope ,",
    "light curves could be extended to 8 months per year .    finally we study variability of the h@xmath0 line width to estimate uncertainties in m@xmath1 estimates from single - epoch data .",
    "we compare the h@xmath0 fwhm measured from high s / n mean spectrum with that measured from each single - epoch spectrum .",
    "we find 14% scatter around the one - to - one relationship , most of which comes from random errors on fwhm measurements using single - epoch spectra .",
    "m@xmath1 estimated from single - epoch spectra with typical s / n of 10 - 15 has 30% uncertainty due to the line width measurement errors .",
    "this uncertainty is significantly smaller than the total uncertainty of m@xmath1 estimates from single - epoch data ( a factor of 3 - 4 ; vestergaard 2002 ) , indicating uncertainties on fwhm may not be a dominant source of uncertainties on virial m@xmath1 , estimates .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the manuscript and numerous suggestions that improved the presentation of our results .",
