    "dwarf starburst galaxies are the more numerous and fainter counterparts of traditional starburst galaxies",
    ". dwarf starbursts will have a particularly important role in the energizing and polluting of the intergalactic medium through galactic winds , as , because of their low escape velocities , even a moderate starburst event in a dwarf galaxy can result in the expulsion of a large fraction of the nuclear processed material in a superwind or outflow ( dekel & silk 1986 ; mac low & ferrara 1999 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ) .",
    "understanding the complexities of starburst processes in dwarf galaxies is therefore an important step in understanding the feedback processes between star - formation and galactic evolution .",
    "radio continuum observations of starburst galaxies are particularly useful in studying the star - formation processes , suffering little of the extinction that complicates matters in the optical and uv , which may appear to be more suitable wavebands for studying young massive star populations ( see hopkins et al .",
    "2001 for a discussion of the merits of different wavelength regimes for finding star formation rates ) .",
    "radio observations can also be used to study populations of supernovae remnants ( snrs ) in starburst galaxies ( e.g. kronberg et al .",
    "2000 , greve et al .  2002 ) , and recent radio observations have revealed objects inferred to be optically obscured super star clusters ( see below ) .",
    "earlier radio observations of dwarf starbursts , at low spatial resolution , have shown them to have a higher radio to optical luminosity ratio than normal spiral galaxies and spectral indices significantly flatter than a sample of spiral galaxies ( klein , wielebinski & thuan 1984 ) .",
    "this was attributed to lower magnetic fields in the dwarf galaxies effectively suppressing non - thermal emission .",
    "however , more recent and higher resolution observations are showing a more complex and interesting picture .",
    "vla observations of the dwarf starburst henize  2 - 10 by kobulnicky & johnson ( 1999 , see also kobulnicky & johnson 2000 ) found several compact radio sources in the central regions .",
    "these sources have positive spectral indices ( i.e. @xmath2 , with the radio flux defined as @xmath3 ) , indicative of optically thick bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "these radio knots are believed to be unusually dense  regions , with sizes of @xmath4pc and densities @xmath5 , associated with optically observed super star clusters .",
    "further , vla observations of ngc5253 ( another dwarf starburst ) showed unusually high levels of free - free emission , most of it from a single source ( turner , ho & beck 1998 ) . several regions with a positive spectral index were also detected , which were inferred to be very young regions of star - forming activity .",
    "these authors also found regions of non - thermal emission , probably associated with snrs .",
    "further observations showed what was inferred to be a dense compact region , with a size of only 12pc , but containing several thousand o - stars , and which was termed a radio supernebula  ( turner , beck & ho 2000 ) .",
    "beck , turner & kovo ( 2000 ) have presented vla observations of nine wolf - rayet galaxies ( a particular class of starburst galaxies , containing very young and massive wolf - rayet stars , conti 1991 ) , including seven dwarf starbursts . in the majority of these galaxies",
    "the global spectral indices were much flatter than in spiral galaxies ( the only exception being ngc3049 which is a large spiral galaxy as well as a wolf - rayet galaxy , which has a spectral index of @xmath6 ) .",
    "this flatter index indicates a higher fraction of free - free emission in these galaxies , and in fact many of the galaxies had regions with positive spectral index , indicative of self - absorbed free - free emission and hence very recent and compact star - formation .",
    "these objects are probably related to the optical super star clusters ( sscs ) observed with _ hst _ in many starbursts and galaxy mergers ( see whitmore 2002 for a review ) , but which are viewed at a younger age , and which are still enclosed within the parental cloud , obscuring them at optical wavelengths .",
    "other examples of optically obscured sscs seen at radio wavelengths are found in ngc2146 ( a spiral starburst galaxy ) , where a number of radio sources with positive spectral indices are seen , and that have been interpreted as being due to massive ultra - compact  regions , indicative of extremely young star - formation ( tarchi et al.2000 ) .",
    "kobulnicky & johnson ( 2001 ) and johnson et al .  (",
    "2001 ) summarise the status of radio observations of these young starburst regions , and coins the phrase ultra - dense  regions ( or udregions ) .",
    "it is worth noting that _ merlin _ observations of the nearby ( 2.2mpc ) dwarf starburst ngc1569 found no emission associated with the optically visible sscs in this galaxy , but did find a number of radio supernovae or supernovae remnants ( greve et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "in this paper we report on radio observations , taken with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , of two dwarf starburst galaxies , ngc3125 and ngc5408 , which are also wolf - rayet galaxies .",
    "because wolf - rayet galaxies contain very young massive stars and are thus sites of very recent star - formation , they are the obvious place to look for optically obscured star clusters .",
    "radio maps with good spatial resolutions are therefore very important in understanding the global properties of these objects .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 the characteristics of the target galaxies are discussed , in section  3 the radio observations and analysis are described and the results are discussed in section  4 .",
    ".parameters for ngc3125 and ngc5408 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab3 ]      the observed radio morphologies of these two dwarf starbursts shows several discrete regions of emission , in which much of the observed emission is coincident with massive star - clusters in both galaxies .",
    "leaving aside the possibility of an agn and emission mechanisms associated with a massive black - hole ( for which there appears to be no evidence of in these galaxies ) the likely emission mechanisms are ( c.f .",
    "forbes & norris 1998 ) :    1 .",
    "supernovae and supernova remnants : cosmic rays accelerated by supernovae and supernova remnants , which then interact with the interstellar magnetic field to emit synchrotron emission .",
    "the typical spectral index of this synchrotron emission will be @xmath7 . in starburst and normal galaxies",
    "this component will tend to be distributed throughout the disk .",
    "however , in ngc3125 and ngc5408 we are dealing with dense stellar clusters , which could contain many sn remnants in a small volume , giving rise to a compact region of synchrotron emission .",
    "regions : hot electrons in  regions generate free  free emission . at cm wavelengths",
    "most  regions are optically thin , resulting in a flat spectrum ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , some compact hii regions are seen to be optically thick , giving rise to a rising spectrum at cm wavelengths ( ngc5253  turner , ho & beck 1998 ; hen  2 - 10  kobulnicky & johnson 1999 ; ngc2146  tarchi et al .",
    "200 ; m82  mcdonald et al .",
    "2002 ) . in these cases , which are probably associated with very young super star clusters , the gas densities are sufficient to cause a turn - over in the emission at low frequencies . in all  regions",
    "the radio spectrum does turnover at some sufficiently low frequency ( for instance , for orion this occurs at @xmath9 m ) .",
    "the radio emission from ultra  luminous infrared galaxies is optically thick to free  free absorption , so that the typical synchrotron spectrum of these galaxies is flattened at low frequencies ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the combined result of these effects in seyfert and starburst galaxies is to produce a typical radio spectral index of @xmath10 ( from the extended synchrotron emission ) with a flattening at low frequencies in some starburst sources because of free  free absorption .    for ngc3125 and ngc5408 ,",
    "the morphology and spectral indices of the radio knots imply that the observed emission is primarily associated with type ii supernovae activity which is associated with star - formation activity within the star - clusters .",
    "the exception is ngc5408:a , which has a flatter index indicative of optically thin free - free emission .",
    "the obvious interpretation is that in this source , which is associated with an ssc , the emission is dominated by the @xmath11 region , and that the cluster is perhaps younger than the others in ngc5408 and supernova activity has not yet begun to dominate the radio emission .",
    "the next step is to see if we can develop a coherent picture of the star - forming behaviour of these galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that in these galaxies the optical light may be dominated ( or have a substantial contribution ) from the star - clusters , but it is likely that the stellar content these clusters only comprise a few percent of the total stellar mass in the galaxies .",
    "however , these clusters may provide a substantial fraction of the ongoing star - formation in the galaxy .",
    "we can estimate the expected supernova rate in the radio emitting regions .",
    "assuming that the 4.80ghz flux is non - thermal emission , then the implied sn rate in the various radio emitting regions can be estimated from ( condon & yin 1990 ) :    @xmath12    for ngc3125 this corresponds to sn rate of @xmath13 for ngc3125:a and @xmath14 for ngc3125:b .",
    "the corresponding sn rates for the ngc5408 regions are in the range @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , we can estimate the star - formation rates from both far - infrared ( fir ) observations and these radio observations .",
    "the fir rates will apply to the whole galaxy while the radio ones will apply to the observed emission regions ( see hopkins et al .",
    "2001 for a comparison of the various methods for estimating star - formation rates in galaxies )    the fir luminosities of @xmath16 ( ngc3125 ) and @xmath17 ( ngc5408 ) .",
    "from kennicutt ( 1998 ) we can estimate the total star - formation rate ( sfr ) in each galaxy from the following relationship :    @xmath18    where the mass range for the star - formation rate is assumed to be @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the far infrared luminosity .",
    "this means that the estimated total sfr in the two galaxies are @xmath21 ( ngc3125 ) and @xmath22 ( ngc5408 ) .",
    "note , that assuming a salpeter imf , the star - formation rate of high mass , that is stars with @xmath23 , will be about 10 per cent of this value .    using the results of condon ( 1992 , see also haarsma et al .",
    "2000 ) we can estimate the star - formation rates in the radio regions from these radio observations .",
    "the implied total star - formation rate in the two regions in ngc3125 is @xmath24 and in ngc5408 the figure is @xmath25 , somewhat higher than the fir values .    as an aside",
    ", we can compare the estimated sn rates with the theoretical expectations from leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) . for an ongoing starburst with a star - formation rate of @xmath26 , a salpeter imf and solar abundance , the expected supernova rate is @xmath27 . for the sfr rates estimated above",
    ", this corresponds to supernova rates of @xmath28 for ngc3125 and @xmath29 for ngc5408 . comparing these values to the estimated sn rates above",
    ", there is reasonable agreement between the integrated sn rates in the various radio emitting regions and these expectations .    as discussed earlier ,",
    "both galaxies are also x - ray luminous .",
    "there are several potential mechanisms for generating the x - rays ; an agn , x - ray binaries , snrs and emission from superbubbles .",
    "there is no evidence for an agn , and while individual supernovae or snrs can be very radio and x - ray luminous ( van dyk et al .",
    "1993 ; fabian & terlevich 1996 ; immler & lewin 2002 ) , their duration as high luminosity object is short - lived .",
    "consequently , high mass x - ray binaries , associated with the active star - formation in these galaxies , are likely to provide much of the observed x - ray emission .    extrapolating from the star - formation rate in our own galaxy ( @xmath30 )",
    "we can estimate the number of luminous x - ray binaries in each system .",
    "the galaxy has an estimated population of luminous high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) of @xmath31 ( dalton & sarazin 1995 ) .",
    "based on this , these two dwarf starbursts should have a high mass x - ray binary population of @xmath32 for ngc3125 and @xmath33 for ngc5408 .",
    "note , that this refers only to the most luminous hmxbs , namely those with @xmath34 .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosities of these galaxies are @xmath35 ( ngc3125 ) and @xmath36 ( ngc5408 ) , meaning that ngc5408 is substantially more x - ray luminous than ngc3125 , although having a smaller star - formation rate . the x - ray emission from ngc3125",
    "could be dominated by x - ray binaries , however , this is unlikely to be the case for ngc5408 and we may need an additional very x - ray luminous source , such as the objects seen by the  satellite in other star - forming galaxies ( for instance , kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ) believed to be intermediate mass black - holes .",
    "consequently , from these observations , we can conclude that the radio emission in ngc3125 and ngc5408 is predominantly non - thermal in nature and is most likely dominated by processes associated with type ii snrs which are associated with recent starburst activity in the massive stellar clusters .",
    "only one source in ngc5408 has a flatter spectral index indicative of optically thin free - free emission .",
    "it will remain to be seen if the cluster associated with this radio source is younger than the other clusters in this galaxy . in the case of",
    "ngc3125 we have a coherent picture , whereby the expected star - formation rate , supernovae rate and massive x - ray binaries populations can give rise to the observed properties , while in the case of ngc5408 although the fir and radio luminosities are broadly consistent the galaxy is substantially x - ray overluminous .",
    "this galaxy may well be the home of a single super - luminous system such as has been seen in several other galaxies .",
    "one problem with the simple analysis presented here is that it has mostly assumed a constant star - formation rate . in many of these stellar clusters",
    "there may be a coeval population of stars and in this situation the sn rate can be very time variable .",
    "a more detailed optical analysis is needed for these galaxies , to investigate the masses / ages of the star - clusters .",
    "however , these new observations are throwing some more light on the radio evolution of massive star - clusters in dwarf starbursts .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented new radio observations of two dwarf starburst galaxies , ngc3125 and ngc5408 .",
    "several discrete regions of radio emission are seen in these galaxies , most of them associated with massive young star clusters .",
    "the radio spectral indices indicate the emission is dominated by synchrotron emission associated with supernova activity , though in one case a flatter spectrum is observed , possibly indicative of a younger cluster .",
