    "the fundamental equation of the non - relativistic theory of gravity is the newtonian gravitational law , which predicts the potential energy of the gravitational attraction between two bodies as : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is a measure for the potential energy , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the masses of the two particles , @xmath4 is the distance between the masses and @xmath5 is the universal gravitational constant .",
    "in contrast the theory of general relativity  @xcite provides a framework for extending newton s theory to objects with relativistic velocities . in general relativity",
    "one solves the basic field equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gravitational metric , @xmath8 is the tensor for the curvature of space - time[multiblock footnote omitted ] and @xmath9 is the total energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath10 may be needed on cosmological scales , and is today believed to have a non - zero expectation value in the universe .",
    "when we solve the einstein equation we find the metric which is a local object that depends on the geometry of space - time . in this way a solution of the gravitational problem is found .",
    "einstein s description holds in the fully relativistic regime , and its low - energy and non - relativistic predictions match the expectations of newtonian mechanics .",
    "a longstanding puzzle in modern physics is how to we d general relativity with the quantum theory .",
    "it is not at all obvious how this might be achieved since general relativity and quantum mechanics seem to be based on completely different perceptions of physics ",
    "nevertheless this question is one of the most pressing questions of modern theoretical physics and has been the subject of many studies , @xmath11 , see refs .",

    "all sorts of interpretational complications arise when trying to quantize general relativity .",
    "a possible starting point for such a theory appears to be to interpret general relativity as a quantum field theory , to let the metric be the basic gravitational field , and to quantize the einstein - hilbert action : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the scalar curvature .",
    "however the above action is not self contained under renormalization since loop diagrams will generate new terms not present in the original action refs .",
    "this is the renowned renormalization problem that hinders the quantization of general relativity .",
    "one of the physically interesting problem is the calculation of the leading order quantum corrections to the newtonian potential which has been in the focus of many studies in different schemes , using feynman diagrams for the loops in the graviton propagator  @xcite , renormalizable @xmath15 gravity  @xcite and semiclassical gravity  @xcite .    after introducing an effective field theory for processes with a typical energy less the planck mass , i.e. with @xmath16 gev@xmath17 , by weinberg @xcite ,",
    "the effective theory for gravity can been modeled in a manner analogous with that of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite for qcd .",
    "this way to look at general relativity was proposed by shiekh  @xcite and donoghue  @xcite , and they have shown that reliable quantum predictions at the low energies can be made .    in spite of fact that unmodified general relativity is not renormalizable , be it pure general relativity or general relativity coupled to bosonic or fermionic matter , see e.g.  @xcite , using the framework of an effective field theory , these theories do become order by order renormalizable in the low energy limit . when general relativity is treated as an effective theory , renormalizability simply fails to be an issue .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences arising e.g. at the 1-loop level are dealt with by renormalizing the parameters of higher derivative terms in the action .    when approaching general relativity in this manner , it is convenient to use the background field method  @xcite .",
    "divergent terms are absorbed away into phenomenological constants which characterize the effective action of the theory .",
    "the price paid is the introduction of a set of never - ending higher order derivative couplings into the theory , unless using the approach of shiekh  @xcite .",
    "the effective action contains all terms consistent with the underlying symmetries of the theory .",
    "perturbatively only a finite number of terms in the action are required for each loop order .    in pioneering papers",
    "@xcite donoghue first has shown how to derive the leading quantum and classical relativistic corrections to the newtonian potential of two masses .",
    "this calculation has since been the focus of a number of publications  @xcite , and this work continues , most recently in the paper  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to difficulty of the calculation and its myriad of tensor indices there has been some disagreement among the results of various authors .",
    "the classical component of the corrections were found long ago by einstein , infeld and hoffmann @xcite , and by eddington and clark @xcite .",
    "later this result was reproduced by iwasaki  @xcite by means of feynman diagrams and has been discussed in the papers  @xcite , and here there is general agreement although there exists an unavoidable ambiguity in defining the potential .",
    "an interesting calculation has been made involving quantum gravitational corrections to the schwarzshild and kerr metrics of scalars and fermions  @xcite where it is shown in detail how the higher order gravitational contributions to these metrics emerge from loop calculations . in the papers  @xcite and  @xcite",
    "have been calculated the leading post - newtonian and quantum corrections to the non - relativistic scattering amplitude of charged scalars and spin- fermions in the combined theory of general relativity and qed .",
    "for the recent reviews of general relativity as an effective field theory , see refs .",
    "@xcite    our notations and conventions on the metric tensor , the gauge - fixed gravitational action , etc .",

    "the heavy degrees of freedom will be integrated out and will hence not contribute to the physics .",
    "any effective field theory is built up from terms with higher and higher numbers of derivative couplings on the light fields and obeying the gauge symmetries of the basic theory .",
    "this gives us a precise description of how to construct effective lagrangians from the gauge invariants of the theory .",
    "we expand the effective lagrangian in the invariants ordered in magnitude of their derivative contributions .",
    "an effective treatment of pure general relativity results in the following lagrangian : @xmath26\\ ] ] where the ellipses denote that the effective action is in fact an infinite series  at each new loop order additional higher derivative terms must be taken into account .",
    "this lagrangian includes all possible higher derivative couplings , and every coupling constant in the lagrangian is considered to be determined empirically unless set to zero to achieve causality  @xcite . similarly one must include higher derivative contributions to the matter lagrangian in order to treat this piece of the lagrangian as an effective field theory  @xcite .    computing the leading low - energy quantum corrections of an effective field theory , a useful distinction is between non - analytical and analytical contributions from the diagrams .",
    "non - analytical contributions are generated by the propagation of two or more massless particles in the feynman diagrams .",
    "such non - analytical effects are long - ranged and , in the low energy limit of the effective field theory , they dominate over the analytical contributions which arise from the propagation of massive particles .",
    "the difference between massive and massless particle modes originates from the impossibility of expanding a massless propagator @xmath27 while : @xmath28 no @xmath29 terms are generated in the above expansion of the massive propagator , thus such terms all arise from the propagation of massless modes .",
    "the analytical contributions from the diagrams are local effects and thus expandable in power series .",
    "non - analytical effects are typically originating from terms which in the s - matrix go as , @xmath11 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 , while the generic example of an analytical contribution is a power series in momentum @xmath32 .",
