    "ethylene oxide ( c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o ) is the simplest epoxide , a ring - shaped organic compound involving an oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms .",
    "since it is believed to lead to the synthesis of amino acids ( cleaves 2003 ) and hence potentially influence early pre - biotic pathways ( miller & schlesinger 1993 ) , c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o may play an important role in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "first detected towards the sgr b2n molecular cloud associated with 10 rotational transitions ( dickens et al .",
    "1997 ) , this molecule has been investigated in a more extended frequency range ( 662 lines between 262 - 358 ghz)(pan et al .",
    "1998 ) and more recently bernstein & lynch ( 2009 ) attributed the unidentified ir band features discovered by gillett et al .",
    "( 1973 ) to ethylene oxide and to another small carbonaceous molecule , cyclopropenylidene .",
    "ikeda et al . ( 2001 ) estimated the c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o fractional abundances by observing 20 massive star - forming regions and two dark clouds .",
    "in fact , ethylene oxide was detected towards 10 of these sources but it was not found in tmc-1 and tmc-1(nh@xmath4 ) dark clouds , in contrast to one of its isomers , acetaldehyde ( ch@xmath4cho ) which seems to be ubiquitous .",
    "ikeda et al . ( 2001 ) also investigated the relationship between c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o abundances and the dust temperature , but without finding any correlation . on the other hand ,",
    "the evidence of similar trends in the column densities of all c@xmath0h@xmath1o isomers and ethanol identified the latter as a possible precursor of ethylene oxide and its isomers .",
    "indeed , a gas - phase pathway for ethylene oxide formation has been proposed ( dickens et al .",
    "1997 ) with ethanol as one of the reactants :    ch@xmath4@xmath5 + c@xmath0h@xmath6oh @xmath7 c@xmath0h@xmath6o@xmath5 + ch@xmath1    c@xmath0h@xmath6o@xmath5 + e@xmath8 @xmath7 c@xmath0h@xmath1o + h    where the formula c@xmath0h@xmath1o does not distinguish among the different isomers .",
    "however , ikeda et al . (",
    "2001 ) performed simulations of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o chemical evolution by including only pure gas - phase reactions at different temperatures and volume densities and they found that the calculated abundances of ethylene oxide decreased when the gas - kinetic temperature was raised .",
    "the results of ikeda et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that other reactions such as grain surface reactions may be important for the synthesis of ethylene oxide .",
    "another gas - phase pathway for the formation of ethylene oxide has been proposed by turner & apponi ( 2001 ) which studied the reaction chain to produce c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o and one of its isomers , vinyl alcohol ( ch@xmath0choh ) , starting with the interaction between ch@xmath4@xmath5 and h@xmath0co ; unfortunately , none of the intermediates of the latter reaction have been identified yet in the ism .",
    "the abundance ratios among the three isomers , acetaldehyde , ethylene oxide and vinyl alcohol , seem to be very uncertain ( bennet et al . 2005 ) , but generally ch@xmath4cho was found to be the most abundant and ch@xmath0choh has been predicted to have a lower abundance than ethylene oxide in the experiments by bennet et al .",
    "this comparison could be explained in the light of the fact that the formation of ethylene oxide occurs via direct addition of the oxygen across the c - c double bond of ethylene , while vinyl alcohol requires an insertion of an oxygen into the c - h bond .",
    "hudson & moore ( 2003 ) suggested a solid state route for the formation of ch@xmath0choh involving exposure of h@xmath0o : c@xmath0h@xmath0 ices to protons and photons , but the first proposed surface scheme for ethylene oxide formation dates back to charnley ( 2004 ) who identified acetaldehyde ( ch@xmath4cho ) as a possible precursor .",
    "the contribution of grain - surface reactions to the production of the three isomers with formula c@xmath0h@xmath1o has also been investigated by bennet et al .",
    "( 2005 ) : they presented the results of electron irradiation on a mix of carbon dioxide and ethylene ice , under interstellar and cometary conditions , to highlight the effect of non - thermal processing of ices .",
    "recently , an alternative solid state pathway for the formation of ethylene oxide has been investigated by ward & price ( 2011 ) who studied the surface reactivity between c@xmath0h@xmath1 and thermal o atoms under astrophysically relevant conditions .",
    "they co - deposited the reactants on a graphite surface at various temperatures in the 12 - 90 k range .",
    "in order to identify the products formed , they recorded desorption spectra and they also selectively ionized the three different isomers with a tunable dye laser .",
    "finally , they performed a similar laboratory study with c@xmath4h@xmath9 as reactant , but unfortunately although c@xmath4h@xmath9o was observed they were unable to identify the isomeric products of the reaction due to the large number of possible molecules with formula c@xmath4h@xmath9o . despite these limitations , the authors assumed that the majority of the c@xmath4h@xmath9o formed is propylene oxide by following the same mechanism as for the case of ethylene oxide production . unlike c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o , c - c@xmath4h@xmath9o has not yet been detected in the ism since it is believed to isomerize to propanal or acetone , which have both been observed in the ism ( hollis et al .",
    "2004 and combes et al .",
    "1987 , snyder et al . 2002 ) . to date , the observed abundances of ethylene oxide have not yet been reproduced by chemical models ; in fact , to our knowledge , none of the grain - surface pathways for formation for ethylene oxide have been included in the models that simulate the star formation process .    in this paper",
    ", we update the ucl_chem gas - grain chemical model with the reaction rates for the production of this species as evaluated by ward & price ( 2011 ) . by following the same logic as these authors",
    ", we extended our study to include the formation of propylene oxide in order to verify if c@xmath4h@xmath9o can be produced under ism conditions even without having any observational evidence of its presence in the interstellar space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 gives details of the model ; section 3 considers the astronomical implications of our study ; section 4 contains a discussion of our results and it also shows a comparison between our theoretical column densities and those taken from the observations . finally , we give our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "ucl_chem is a time - depth dependent gas - grain chemical model which simulates the abundances of molecules in the ism and star - forming regions . the first version of the code was developed by viti & williams ( 1999 ) and revisited by the same authors in 2004 ( viti et al . 2004 ) .",
    "our model has been extensively described in the literature ( see occhiogrosso et al .",
    "2011 for more details ) so here we only highlight the main points .    the process of star formation is simulated in two steps : during phase i the gas collapses to a dense core from a diffuse and atomic state ; at this stage the gas freezes onto the grains and surface reactions occur . during phase ii , the gas and the dust surrounding the central star heat up , causing the sublimation of the icy mantles .",
    "the thermal desorption can be set up to occur instantaneously or as a function of time as in viti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in the latter case , molecules are classified in five different categories as described by the experimental study of collings et al .",
    "( 2004 ) : ( i ) co - like ; ( ii ) h@xmath0o - like ; ( iii ) intermediate ; ( iv ) reactive and ( v ) refractory . in the present work , we consider c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o as h@xmath0o - like ( it will co - desorb when the h@xmath0o ice desorbs ) based on the fact that in the ward & price ( 2011 ) experiments , its desorption profile shows only one peak ( as for the water desorption profile ) and its dipole moment is big enough to assume that the species will have a lower desorption energy from the surface ( in that specific case , graphite ) than from itself . in our model",
    "the temperature of the gas is derived as a function of the luminosity ( and therefore the age ) of the accreting protostar through a simple power law ( see viti et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "the model includes two networks : the gas - phase network is based on the umist database ( woodall et al .",
    "2000 ) ( even if some coefficients have been modified with those from the most recent database kida ( wakelam et al .",
    "2009 ) ) with some updates discussed later ( see section 3 ) , and a grain - surface network with reactions whose rates are experimentally determined where possible .    for this study , we include in our surface reaction network the formation of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o and c - c@xmath4h@xmath9o on the grain surface as investigated by ward & price ( 2011 ) ( see table 1 ) . in order to analyze their data",
    ", these authors developed a simple kinetic model in which molecules can react via eley - rideal ( er ) or langmuir - hinshelwood ( lh ) mechanisms . in the latter case ,",
    "both reactants adsorb and thermalize on the surface before a diffusion reaction occurs .",
    "we consider the reactions to occur via the lh mechanism that seems of greater astrophysical relevance as stated by awad et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and by the authors themselves ( see their paper for the details ) .",
    ".surface reactions investigated by ward & price ( 2011 ) [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure 2 reports the evolution of the fractional abundances of ethylene oxide in both gas - phase ( solid line ) and solid state ( dashed line ) during phase ii for model m7 ( see table 5 ) .",
    "at the end of the collapse , c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o is mostly on the grain surfaces , but its abundance drops rapidly at around 100 k when its co - desorption with water occurs ( after 10@xmath10 yrs ) . at the same time we observe a small growth in the gas - phase c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o abundances",
    "thanks to the thermal desorption of solid c@xmath0h@xmath1o .",
    "the amount of ethylene oxide in the gas - phase remains high at all times due to non - thermal desorption effects .",
    "oh ( solid line ) , hcooch@xmath4 ( dashed line ) and ch@xmath4cn ( dotted line).,width=226 ]    we now compare the theoretical column densities with the observations towards several high - mass star - forming regions where c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o has been detected . in general , we achieve a good agreement , within an order of magnitude , with all of the observational values for c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o reported in table 3 by ikeda et al .",
    "referring to the range of column densities reported by these authors , we consider m7 as the model representing most of the physical characteristics of the regions listed in ikeda et al .",
    "results are reported in table 6 where the calculated and observed column densities for three typical tracers for hot cores : ch@xmath4oh , hcooch@xmath4 and ch@xmath4cn are listed .",
    "the first two species were detected by ikeda et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the latter molecule was investigated by wilner et al ( 1994 ) which mapped the methyl cyanide lines in the millimeter spectrum of orion kl region .",
    "the trends of the fractional abundances of these species as a function of time are displayed in figure 3 .",
    "the c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o , ch@xmath4oh ( solid line ) , hcooch@xmath4 ( dashed line ) and ch@xmath4cn ( dotted line ) theoretical abundances perfectly match their estimated column densities .",
    "this result suggests that the reaction between atomic oxygen and ethylene on the grains is a suitable formation route for ethylene oxide .",
    "we have investigated the feasibility of the reaction between oxygen ice and ethylene ice as possible route for the formation of ethylene oxide . for this purpose , we employed a chemical model for a collapsing core by updating the rate for the formation of ethylene oxide by using the recent experimental determination of this quantity of ward & price ( 2011 ) .",
    "we also tested the sensitivity of ethylene oxide fractional abundances to the changes in the main physical parameters of the collapsing core .",
    "we finally reproduced the effects of non - thermal and thermal desorption of ethylene oxide during both the collapse and the warm - up phase respectively .",
    "our work shows a good agreement between our estimated column densities for ethylene oxide ( under hot core conditions ) and those observed towards several high - mass star - forming regions ( ikeda et al .",
    "2001 ) . in order to verify the reliability of our comparison we also looked at the theoretical and observational abundances of other molecules , such as ch@xmath4oh , hcooch@xmath4 and ch@xmath4cn , known as good tracers of hot cores .",
    "we conclude that c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o can form on the grain surfaces thanks to the reaction between oxygen and ethylene .",
    "we stressed that only 1% of oxygen atoms depletion has to be in form of oxygen ice in order to produce ethylene oxide on the icy mantle ( see section 2 ) ; we also note that there is experimental evidence for a small quantity of ethylene being produced during the hydrogenation of acetylene to form ethane ; therefore it is robust to assume that 1@xmath11 of acetylene is hydrogenated to solid ethylene as an initial condition of our model .",
    "this amount of ethylene is already enough for the observed c - c@xmath0h@xmath1o column densities to be reproduced by our theoretical results .",
    "further experimental studies are perhaps needed to extend our study to other cyclic species that have been detected in the ism , although the complexity of larger molecules may prevent their isomeric speciation as is the case for the recent laboratory study of the formation of c@xmath4h@xmath9o .",
