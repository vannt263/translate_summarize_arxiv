    "for last couple of decades , magnetic shape memory alloys ( msmas ) have been fascinating the researchers because these materials combine different degrees of freedom like structural , magnetic , elastic , caloric etc .",
    ", in a single phase .",
    "coupling of micro - structure with magneto - crystalline anisotropy enables increase of magnetic field - induced strain ( mfis ) , which makes this class of smart materials suitable for micro - mechanical automotive sensors and actuators applications .",
    "other interesting multifunctional properties exhibited by this class of materials are conventional and inverse magneto - caloric effect @xcite , barocaloric @xcite , elastocaloric @xcite , giant magnetoregistance @xcite , exchange bias @xcite , kinetic arrest @xcite , spin - glass @xcite and strain - glass @xcite . in the heart of these applications",
    "is the magnetic - field driven martensitic transformation .",
    "the magnitude and sign of the magnetization difference ( @xmath1 ) between the high temperature austenite phase and the low temperature martensite phase is a key quantity responsible for the functional properties mentioned above .",
    "for example , zeeman energy plays a crucial role in realizing the martensitic transformation in ferromagnetic shape memory alloys .",
    "an externally applied magnetic field performs two different tasks inside msma .",
    "firstly , if the direction of the applied field is different from the easy magnetic axis of the material , the field tries to rotate the magnetization direction along it against the force associated with magnetic anisotropy .",
    "secondly , the field generates driving force across the twin boundaries between martensitic variants , the associated energy is known as zeeman energy . since the energy required to move martensitic domains is lower than the magnetocrystralline anisotropy energy in msma , the pressure created by zeeman energy increases the volume fraction of favorably oriented martensitic variants and lowers the energy of the product phase .",
    "it has been found that a large @xmath1 between the two phases in the presence of moderate external magnetic field @xmath2 , i.e. , the zeeman term @xmath3 , drives the motions of the martensitic domains facilitating the martensitic transformation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sign of @xmath1 is related to the conventional or inverse magnetocaloric effect @xcite . in case of the former ,",
    "a magnetic field will cause a decrease in entropy when applied isothermally and an increase in temperature when applied adiabatically . in case of the later , an increase in entropy will effect a decrease of temperature leading to `` magnetic cooling '' , a phenomenon which can be exploited for green technology in refrigeration . for the inverse magnetocaloric effect",
    ", the magnetization in the martensitic phase has to be lower than that in the austenite phase .",
    "recent research on msmas thus , have focused on exploring materials where @xmath1 can be suitably tuned in order to obtain large zeeman energy with a small field and/or a substantial inverse magneto - caloric effect .",
    "a decade ago , ni@xmath0mnga was discovered as the first promising msma @xcite .",
    "however , ni@xmath0mnga in the stoichiometric composition of 2:1:1 shows only conventional magneto - caloric effect .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 for the system is rather small .",
    "other materials in the ni@xmath0mn_x _ ( _ x_= al , in , sn ) series do not even posses shape memory properties at their stoichiometric compositions .",
    "a lot of research has taken place since then to obtain shape memory and/or inverse magneto - caloric effect in ni@xmath0mnx systems by tuning the electron to atom ( @xmath4 ) ratio by either changing concentration ratio of ni , mn and x @xcite or by doping with another element @xcite .",
    "these approaches led to the investigations into the potentials of mn@xmath0ni_x _ ( _ x_= al , ga , in , sn ) systems .",
    "the exploration in mn@xmath0ni_x _ materials was initiated in 1987 by helmholdt _",
    "et al . _ with their investigation in the structural and the magnetic properties of mn@xmath0nisn form neutron diffraction data @xcite .",
    "their study concluded that unlike the ni@xmath0mn_x _ materials which form the usual heusler structure , mn@xmath0nisn crystallizes in inverse heusler structure . the later structure forces one of the tetrahedral mn atoms to interchange its position with octahedral ni atom making the two mn atoms nearest neighbors .",
    "the next significant step was investigations into the shape memory related properties of mn@xmath0niga , conducted by liu _",
    "the material exhibits an excellent two - way shape memory effect where the martensitic transformation temperature ( t@xmath5 270 k ) is close to room temperature and the curie temperature ( t@xmath6 588 k ) is quite high @xcite .",
    "the last two parameters of mn@xmath0niga are better than those of ni@xmath0mnga .",
    "this study hinted at the better functional properties of this material compared to the prototype and thus , generated immense interests into investigations of the mn@xmath0ni_x _ materials with the possibilities of discovering new msmas suitable for practical applications .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that mn@xmath0nisn also has very high curie temperature ( t@xmath6 530 k ) @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction experiments confirmed that mn@xmath0niga also forms an inverse heusler structure in the austenite phase .",
    "experimental reports on the structure and shape memory property of mn@xmath0nial and mn@xmath0niin are not yet available .",
    "however theoretical calculations on mn@xmath0ni_x _ confirm that all the materials exhibit shape memory effect and prefer inverse heusler structure @xcite .",
    "the direct consequence for crystallizing in this structure is lower saturation magnetization due to opposite and unequal moments of nearest neighbor mn atoms , as compared to prototype ni@xmath0mnga , where all the constituent atoms couple ferromagnetically . for mn@xmath0nial and mn@xmath0niga , total",
    "magnetization reported is @xmath71 @xmath8 and for mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn those are @xmath70.5",
    "@xmath8 @xcite , while ni@xmath0mnga posses a high moments of @xmath74 @xmath8 .",
    "since the mfis is directly proportional to the total magnetization , lowering of the later would results in a smaller mfis in mn@xmath0niga ( @xmath74@xmath9 ) , whereas largest mfis are observed in nearly stoichiometric composition of nimnga msma is about 10@xmath9 @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "helmholdt _ et al .",
    "_ observed a higher value of total magnetization , nearly 2.5 @xmath8 , in cubic austenite phase of mn@xmath0nisn @xcite .",
    "they showed that within the inverse heusler structure , there is significant anti - site disorder among the ni and mn atoms at the tetrahedral positions .",
    "recent neutron diffraction studies @xcite and first principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations on mn@xmath0niga @xcite and mn@xmath0nisn @xcite also confirmed the presence of anti - site disorder in these materials .",
    "dft calculations conclusively showed that such anti - site disorder is responsible for a significantly large magnetic moment in the high temperature phase .",
    "the calculations also showed that mn@xmath0niga would exhibit inverse magneto - caloric effect @xcite .",
    "motivated by these discoveries , in this communication , we perform dft calculations to investigate the magnetic properties of the four mn@xmath0ni_x _ alloys which are potential msmas , in crystal structures relevant to the austenite and martensite phases , with and without anti - site disorder .",
    "we specifically looked at the trends in @xmath1 across the series .",
    "we analyze the results by computing the electronic structures and the inter - atomic exchange interactions for each of the cases .",
    "the outcome of this systematic study indicates that the mn@xmath0ni_x _ alloys may have better functionalities than the prototype msmas , which is driven by the anti - site disorder inherent to these systems , an important feat relevant in todays technology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss the computational details .",
    "section iii contains the results and subsequent discussions on the magnetic properties , the electronic structure and the inter - atomic exchange interactions .",
    "summary and importance of this work are described in the conclusions section .",

    "the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) as parameterized by vosko - wilk - nusair ( vwn ) was used as the exchange - correlation part of the potential to solve the kohn - sham equation @xcite . the angular momentum cut - off to the plane wave",
    "was taken to be @xmath10=3 .",
    "the brillouin zone integrations have been carried out on a uniform 24@xmath1124@xmath1124 _ k_-mesh .",

    "the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) was used to incorporate the effects of disorder @xcite .",
    "the magnetic pair exchange interactions have been calculated with multiple scattering green function formalism as implemented in spr - kkr code @xcite .",
    "spin fluctuation theories for metals map the complicated itinerant electron systems onto an effective heisenberg hamiltonian having the classical spins as @xmath13 the indices @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent different sublattices , _ i _ and _ j _ denote the atomic positions and @xmath16 is the unit vector along the direction of magnetic moments at site _",

    "are also presented in table iv .",
    "the results show the following trends :    \\(i ) the magnetic moments in the martensitic phase is lower than that in the austenite phase for both `` ordered '' and `` disordered '' configurations and for all three alloys under consideration , making @xmath30 .",
    "\\(ii ) for the `` disordered '' configurations , that is , both * dc * and * dt * , the magnetic moments are substantially higher than their `` ordered '' counterparts , i.e. , * oc * and * ot * respectively .",
    "the increment is significantly greater in austenite phases than that in the martensitic phases .",
    "the total moment increases by @xmath31 and @xmath32 for mn@xmath0niga , mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn respectively as configuration changes from * oc * to * dc*. in the martensitic phases , the increase in moments as configuration changes from * ot * to * dt * are @xmath33 and @xmath34 for mn@xmath0niga , mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn respectively .",
    "this results in a huge gain in @xmath1 in the `` anti - site disordered '' configurations over that in the `` ordered '' configurations .",
    "the behavior of the magnetic moments across crystal structures , configurations and materials , are driven by the crystallographically inequivalent mn atoms .",
    "the results suggest that the ferrimagnetic ground states are achieved due to the anti - parallel alignments of the mni and mnii atoms . in",
    "the `` ordered '' configurations , the magnitude of the moments compensate each other substantially resulting in relatively low moments .",
    "drastic changes are observed in cases of anti - site disorder .",
    "the substantially high moments in * dc * and * dt * configurations are driven by considerable quenching of mn moments at the sites where they form alloys with ni .",
    "the moments of the other mn atom remain nearly unaltered .",
    "the ni moments , on the other hand , increases significantly , bringing in an increase in the net moments .",
    "the changes are more dramatic in the austenites where the mni moment changes between @xmath35 as compared to changes between @xmath36 in the martensites .",
    "the significant changes in the mni moments driven by the anti - site disorder coupled with a substantially larger changes in the total moments in the austenites lead to larger @xmath1 when anti - site disorder affects the sublattices with tetrahedral symmetry in the inverse heusler structure .",
    "this is a significant result as it shows that all three mn@xmath0nix alloys may exhibit inverse magneto - caloric effects and a large zeeman energy can be achieved with relatively small magnetic field making them attractive from the point of view of shape memory applications . it may be noted that the prototype msma ni@xmath0mnga has @xmath37 and the magnitude of @xmath1 is only   @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "thus , mn@xmath0nix alloys turn out to be msmas with better functional parameters even with the stoichiometric composition of 2:1:1 . in the sections",

    "this explains the reasons for getting substantial compensation of mn moments leading to rather small total moments .",
    "the features in the minority bands near the fermi level emerge due to hybridizations between mni and ni 3@xmath39 states . for mn@xmath0niga and mn@xmath0niin ,",
    "such hybridizations give rise to a small peak around -0.25 ev in the minority bands while for mn@xmath0nisn , a prominent peak around -0.5 ev emerges .",

    "expectedly , major changes in the electronic structure come from the mni and the ni densities of states .",
    "the total densities of states in the majority spin channel become rather featureless and flat in the * dc * configurations . the densities of states in the minority bands , although still retain some of the structures , but become smooth in general . for example , the peaks near the fermi level in the minority bands of mn@xmath0niga and mn@xmath0niin and the peaks at the fermi level in the minority bands of mn@xmath0nisn are all broadened in the * dc * configuration .",
    "mni densities of states are affected most followed by the ni ones .",
    "the minority spin mni peaks ( around -1.5 ev for mn@xmath0niga and mn@xmath0niin , and around -2 ev for mn@xmath0nisn ) broaden considerably and move closer to fermi level ( around -1.4 ev for mn@xmath0niga and mn@xmath0niin , and around -1.3 ev for mn@xmath0nisn ) .",
    "the peaks near or at the fermi level in the minority channels are now destroyed producing a continuously increasing densities of states near the fermi levels .",
    "the peaks in the unoccupied parts of the majority bands of mni atoms are severely modified : their intensities decrease considerably and they flatten out into broad plateaus extending into the occupied parts .",
    "thus , the occupied parts in the majority bands start to get filled with states .",
    "consequently , the magnetic moments of mni atoms decrease in magnitudes as compared to the ones in the * oc * configurations .",
    "densities of states in both spin channels associated with ni too get modified with sharp peaks in * oc * configurations getting broadened in general .",
    "the states in the minority channels start to shift towards the fermi level , while there is hardly any shift in the states in the majority channels ( comparison of panels ( d ) and ( h ) illustrate these clearly ) .",
    "these features explain the slight increases in the ni moment in the * dc * configurations in comparison to the * oc * configurations of all three alloys .",
    "the anti - site disorder between mni and ni sites do not affect mnii densities of states substantially.the major features of the mnii densities of states in * oc * configuration do not change in * dc * configurations , the peaks only broaden explaining why the mnii moments remain almost intact in spite of anti - site disorder . to summarize , the drastic re - distribution of electronic states in both spin channels of primarily mni atoms , brought about by the anti - site disorder between the sites of same point group symmetry , quenches the mni moments substantially reducing the exchange splitting and thereby increasing the total magnetic moment significantly as compared to the * oc * configurations.the degree of this increment depends on the degree of changes in the mni densities of states .",
    "the maximum changes occur in mn@xmath0nisn , where , the peak at -2 ev in the mni minority band moves substantially towards the fermi level , relocating itself at -1.25 ev as one goes from * oc * to * dc * , the other peaks too make such a move , affecting the electron distribution considerably , explaining why the changes in the moments are the largest in the series .",

    "the percentage changes quoted in section iiic exemplify this . in order to understand the reasons behind this",
    ", one needs to inspect the panels ( e)-(h ) in fig .",
    "2 - 4 where comparisons between densities of states in the * dc * and * dt * configurations are done .",
    "the results suggest that for all three materials , the total densities of states at the fermi level in the * dt * configurations are less than that in the * dc * configurations .",
    "this provides a clue to the stability of the martensitic phases .",
    "in fact , the densities of states are suppressed prominently in the minority bands of between -0.3 ev and the fermi level in the * dt * configurations .",
    "in contrast , the minority densities of states in * dt * configurations for all three materials get elevated as compared to the * dc * configurations between -0.3 ev and -1 ev . these undoubtedly point to the fact that electron states are transferred to the lower energies as the systems undergo martensitic transformations , explaining the stabilizations of the martensitic phases .    from the atom projected densities of states , it is clear that the hybridizations of ni - mni 3@xmath39 minority electrons are responsible for such re - distributions of electronic states when the system undergoes a tetragonal deformation . due to the tetragonal distortion , the ni - mni hybridizations strengthen due to the significant reductions of the ni - mni bond distances .",
    "table v shows the bond distances between various mn atoms in the austenite and in the martensitic phases .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate that only the ni - mni inter - atomic distances reduce by almost @xmath40 in all the cases . on the other hand , the changes in the majority band electronic structures due to tetragonal distortions are overwhelmingly due to the mni states . a comparison between * dc * and * dt * configurations show that states in the mni majority bands are pushed into the unoccupied part as the systems undergo martensitic transformations .",
    "this coupled with the shifting of minority states towards lower energies produce a larger exchange splitting of mni resulting in an increase of the net mni moment as compared to the austenitic phases .",
    "thus the total moment in the martensitic phases do not change as much as they do in the austenite phases upon changes in the sublattice occupancies due to anti - site disorder in the sites with tetrahedral symmetries , resulting in a larger @xmath1 in the `` disordered '' configurations .      ) as a function of inter - atomic distance d for mn@xmath0niga .",

    "the mni - mnii interactions are anti - ferromagnetic while the ni - mnii interactions are ferromagnetic . comparisons of * oc * and * ot * configurations show that upon tetragonal distortions , the anti - ferromagnetic mni - mnii interactions strengthen while the ferromagnetic ni - mnii interactions weaken , resulting in a net loss of mnii moments and subsequent low moments in the * ot * configurations .",

    "<S> moreover , experiments on mn@xmath0niga and mn@xmath0nisn suggest that the alloys deviate from the perfect inverse heusler arrangement and that there is chemical disorder at the sublattices with tetrahedral symmetry . in this work , we investigate the effects of such chemical disorder on phase stabilities and magnetic properties using first - principles electronic structure methods . </S>",
    "<S> we find that except mn@xmath0nial , all other alloys show signatures of martensitic transformations in presence of anti - site disorder at the sublattices with tetrahedral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this improves the possibilities of realizing martensitic transformations at relatively low fields and the possibilities of obtaining significantly large inverse magneto - caloric effects , in comparison to perfect inverse heusler arrangement of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the origin of such improvements in functional properties by investigating electronic structures and magnetic exchange interactions . </S>"
