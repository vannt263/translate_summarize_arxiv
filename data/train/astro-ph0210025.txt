    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close , interacting binaries in which a roche - lobe filling main sequence star ( the secondary ) looses matter to its somewhat more massive white dwarf companion . in the absence of strong magnetic fields the angular momentum conservations leads to the formation of an accretion disc around the primary component through which the matter from the secondary is accreted onto the compact object .",
    "a detailed description of such systems is given in warner ( 1995 ) , an introduction in hellier ( 2001 ) .",
    "if the mass transfer rate is below a certain limit , these discs undergo outbursts , during which the system brightens by a few magnitudes .",
    "the cause of such outbursts is the accumulation of material in the disc leading to a temperature increase and subsequently ionization of hydrogen .",
    "the changed opacity leads to a sudden further increase in temperature .",
    "the system is in outburst .",
    "however , with such a low mass accretion rate as is typical for a dwarf nova this state can not be maintained .",
    "subsequently , due to a decrease in surface density and temperature the hydrogen eventually recombines and the disc returns to its pre - outburst , quiescent state .",
    "osaki ( 1996 ) gives an overview on mechanisms and outburst types .",
    "certain cvs additionally show so - called superoutbursts .",
    "these outburst last longer than normal outbursts , but show a similar maximum brightness .",
    "additionally , they are associated with so - called superhumps , short brightenings with a period slightly dissimilar to the orbital period .",
    "the superoutbursts are usually associated with the accretion disc s apsidal precession ( see e.g.  patterson et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the eclipsing cataclysmic variable v2051  oph was discovered by sanduleak ( 1972 )",
    ". only few outbursts of the system have been reported ( warner & odonoghue 1987 , warner & cropper 1983 , bateson 1980 ) with a maximal magnitude in b of about 13 in september 1980 , possibly in april 1982 and in may 1984 .",
    "it is possible that outbursts were missed due to the faintness of the system ( wenzel 1984 ) . in may 1998",
    "the first superoutburst was detected ( kiyota & kato 1998 ) .",
    "we observed v2051  oph during this superoutburst between maximum and near quiescence .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of these data using the eclipse mapping technique invented by horne ( 1985 ) .",
    "our observing set consists of 10 eclipses taken in four nights between 23 and 27 may 1998 ( interrupted by a cloudy night ) during the superoutburst first reported by r.  stubbings through vsnet .",
    "the data were gathered by w.  offutt with the 60 cm ritchey - chretien telescope at the w&b observatory in new mexico / usa using a # 21 orange filter which covers r band and the long wavelength region of the v band , see fig .",
    "[ orange ] . for reasons described in section  [ lightcurves ]",
    "the eclipse light curves were not averaged or phase binned , but left at the original phase resolution of 10 to 15sec ( about 0.0023 in phase ) .",
    "a log of the superoutburst data is shown in table  [ tab_sodata ] .",

    "assuming that in superoutburst the disc emits as an optically thick source , we derive brightness temperatures from observations in an orange filter ( part of v and up to i ) .",
    "the reconstructed maps show that the disc cools down considerably during the four nights .    only in the intermediate eclipses",
    "( i.e.  s34 , s49 , s50 , s51 , s66 ) do we see indications for a cooling front as expected by theoretical calculations ( e.g.  cannizzo 1993 ) .",
    "measuring the location of the cooling front in s34 and s49 we derive a speed of @xmath5  km  s@xmath3 , measuring the speed of the cooling front between s51 and s66 we also derive a speed of about @xmath5  km  s@xmath3 , whereas these two cooling fronts are not identical .",
    "these speeds are comparable to the value menou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found with numerical simulations and who predict a fraction of a km  s@xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , it is comparable with the speeds derived with eclipse mapping of @xmath8 to @xmath9  km  s@xmath3 for ex  dra ( decreasing during outburst , baptista & cataln 2001 ) , of @xmath10  km  s@xmath3 for ip  peg ( bobinger et al .",
    "1997 ) and @xmath11 to @xmath12  km  s@xmath3 for oy car in superoutburst ( bruch , beele & baptista 1996 ) .",
    "now , why do we see two distinctly different cooling fronts ? the explanation can be found in numerical calculations by e.g.  menou et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who find that an inward moving cooling front can reflect an outward moving heating front which again reflects into an inward moving cooling front .",
    "if we assume this scenario we derive a speed of @xmath6  km  s@xmath3 for the reflected heating front .",
    "a speed of a few km  s@xmath3 is typical for heating fronts ( menou et al.1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , the reflection of the heating front occurs at a disc radius @xmath13 of about @xmath14  cm , compatible with menou et al.s ( 2000 ) finding that they occur at @xmath15  cm in their simulations .",
    "if such multiple reflections of cooling and heating fronts do occur in v2051  oph , we should observe re - flares as predicted by numerical simulations ( menou et al .",
    "unfortunately , the coverage of this object by amateur astronomers ( vsnet , aavso ) during the so far observed superoutbursts is too sparse to confirm or reject the appearance of re - flares .",
    "detailed observations during the next super outburst are highly desirable .      during superoutburst , we see a partially strong , variable peak in the intensity distribution on the edge of the disc .",
    "it is probably caused by an elliptical , precessing disc : whenever one of the vertices of the semimajor axis of the disc is close to the secondary , the disc will experience tidal forces leading to precession and local heating of the disc .",
    "the disc will react on the temperature increase by flaring up near the secondary .",
    "so , the location of the peak gives a rough estimate for the phase of the apsidal precession . in appendix  [ app_test ]",
    "we show that the location of a bright area ( not to be confused with the bright spot ) on the disc edge can be relatively well determined .",
    "looking at the distribution of light along the rim of the disc , we identify three structures present in most reconstructions : ( a ) a central peak close to azimuth @xmath16 ( facing the secondary ) ; ( b ) a secondary peak in the profile of the central peak ; and ( c ) a broad underlying brightness distribution with a maximum at 90@xmath17 and/or -90@xmath17 .",
    "the latter peaks at the same side of the disc as the secondary peak is located .",
    "similar features appear in the test ( appendix  [ app_test ] ) .",
    "the central peak is also present in the test cases and therefore most likely an artefact , although it could also be associated with the bright spot where the ballistic stream hits the accretion disc .",
    "such a spot was not considered in the test case .",
    "the location of the bright spot is only marginally influenced by a apsidal motion of an elliptical , precessing disc .",
    "as apparent from the tests , the large scale variation on the disc rim is most likely an artefact .",
    "if we measure the position of the second peak , we find a 10@xmath17 prograde shift per eclipse or a 10 - 20@xmath17 backwards shift per day .",
    "if this can be considered an indication for the apsidal motion of the disc , we arrive at a value for the precession period @xmath18 of 51@xmath7 to 54@xmath7 , slightly larger than two days ( therefore the apparent backward shift during consecutive nights )",
    ". this would mean the disc is slightly larger than the 3:1 resonance radius @xmath19 of 0.68@xmath20 and the superhump period ( @xmath21 ) , warner 1995 ) should be 2.5 min or 3% larger than the orbital period @xmath22 hours , i.e. @xmath23(predicted ) = 1.5422@xmath24 0.0013@xmath7 .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the superhump period of 0.06423@xmath25 = 1.54152@xmath7 independently determined by kiyota & kato ( 1998 ) during the same super outburst .",
    "this value for the precession period is very typical for su  uma type dwarf novae , e.g.  dv  uma ( 67@xmath7 , patterson et al .",
    "2000 ) , ht  cas ( 52@xmath7 ) , z  cha ( 51@xmath7 ) , oy  car ( 65@xmath7 ) , ir gem ( 47@xmath7 ) , aq eri ( 52@xmath7 ) to name but a few or even the nova v1974 cyg with 44@xmath7 ( retter , leibowitz & ofek 1997 ) .",
    "numerical calculations of super outbursts of dwarf novae with a similar mass ratio as v2051  oph give on average a slightly larger ratio of @xmath26 of about 1.06 ( murray 1998 ) compared to our 1.03 .",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath27 in superoutburst appears very high , around @xmath2  gs@xmath3  in our first night and varying throughout the disc .",
    "this is about two magnitudes larger than in quiescence ( about @xmath28  gs@xmath3 , vrielmann et al .",
    "2002 ) . towards the end of our observing run (",
    "somewhat before the end of the outburst ) the disc cools down and shows a mass accretion rate of about @xmath4  gs@xmath3 , still a magnitude higher than the quiescent level .    only occasionally the disc appears to follow the steady state models and then only in intermediate disc regions between 0.1@xmath20 and 0.2@xmath20 . at other times",
    "the distribution is rather flat . during the last eclipse ,",
    "when the disc is near the quiescent level , indication for a bright spot can be seen at the expected location where the accretion stream hits the disc .",
    "since the disc undergoes dramatic changes during the course of an outburst with cooling fronts travelling through the material , we would not expect it to settle down completely into a steady state .",
    "however , the fact that parts of the disc do seem to appear in steady state suggests that the time scale for returning into the steady state is relatively short , of the order of a day or less .",
    "according to tylenda s ( 1981 ) calculations , the mass accretion rate in superoutburst is too high and the disc is too small ( outer radius at @xmath29 cm ) to show optically thin areas  the disc should be everywhere optically thick .",
    "this agrees very well with our assumption to consider the brightness temperatures as good approximations of the gas temperatures .",
    "the eclipse mapping shows that the uneclipsed component is decreasing in strength on decline from outburst , but never disappearing completely , as the analysis of the quiescence data show ( vrielmann et al .",
    "a similar variability has been found for ex dra by baptista & cataln ( 1999 ) where the out - of - eclipse flux in r dropped during decline from outburst and practically disappeared at minimum light . at that time",
    "ex  dra s disc is reduced to the immediate vicinity of the white dwarf .",
    "baptista & cataln suggest this variable part of the uneclipsed component is due to a disc wind and a chromosphere ejected by the inner part of the disc .",
    "the variation in these components is presumably due to a variable mass accretion rate .",
    "our geometrical model of the superoutburst disc is very simple ; the disc may in fact be thicker , tilted , warped or only flare close to the secondary .",
    "the latter geometrical model would introduce too many free parameters ( extent and location of flared part ) which we can not determine from our data .",
    "however , the uneclipsed component is a flux independent of orbital phase and therefore unlikely to originate in the ( eclipsed parts of the ) disc itself , but rather in a region above the disc .",
    "the easiest explanation is the same as for ex  dra : a variable disc wind triggered by the outburst .",
    "we thank all amateur astronomers who are dedicating much of their spare time to continously monitor dwarf novae in order to detect outbursts .",
