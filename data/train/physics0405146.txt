    "the faraday law of induction equates the change of the magnetic flux @xmath0 to the sum of potential drops along a wire loop , @xmath1 it contains two effects : the first concerns a changing field at constant area , @xmath2 , and is obtained by integrating the maxwell equation , @xmath3 .",
    "the second effect is given by changing the area of a conducting loop at a static ( and frequently uniform ) field , @xmath4 .",
    "this is a little harder to grasp : since @xmath5 , an integration of the electric field around the loop is zero , @xmath6 , and it appears surprising at first that a current should nevertheless flow .",
    "the prevalent explanation is  @xcite : the electrons in the moving section of the loop are subject to the lorentz force , finite even if the electric field vanishes , @xmath7 .",
    "it is their response to , and the resultant motion along , @xmath8 that gives rise to the current @xmath9 , see fig  [ f1 ] .",
    "+    more quantitatively , observing that @xmath10 is the force per unit charge , same as the electric field @xmath11 , one concludes that both should also otherwise be similar .",
    "so integrating @xmath10 along the loop yields an  induced \" electric potential @xmath12 .",
    "and it is only natural to employ @xmath13 in the ohm law , @xmath14 with @xmath15 the total electric resistance of the loop , and @xmath9 the current .",
    "because this is reminiscent of batteries , @xmath13 is also referred to as an electromotive force .",
    "when first encountering the faraday s law , students are frequently sensitized by their teachers to the disconcerting fact that this beautifully simple law lacks a unified understanding , as one needs both the lorentz force and one of the maxwell equations to derive it . in his famous lectures",
    "@xcite , feynman succinctly described , and lamented , a general sense of resignation :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ we know of no other place in physics where such a simple and accurate general principle requires for its real understanding an analysis in terms of _ two different phenomena_. usually such a beautiful generalization is found to stem from a single deep underlining principle .",
    "nevertheless , in this case there does not appear to be any such profound implication .",
    "we have to understand the  rule \" as the combined effect of two quite separate phenomena . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    two objections to the above view of induction are also worthy of some attention .",
    "first , there are two different lorentz forces : the macroscopic one , @xmath16 , given in terms of the averaged field , expresses the directly verifiable force on a current carrying wire .",
    "the force on an electron , @xmath17 , on the other hand , is a microscopic formula , given in terms of the electron velocity @xmath18 and the microscopic field @xmath19 .",
    "( only in this paragraph does @xmath19 denote the microscopic field .",
    "it is always the macroscopic , coarse - grained field otherwise . )",
    "electrons in conductors have a broad velocity distribution , and they are exposed to strongly varying fields .",
    "therefore , it appears strikingly bold to assert that the average magnetic force per unit charge , @xmath20 , is simply @xmath21 , the velocity of the wire times the average @xmath22-field , as we did above .",
    "it is instructive to reflect upon the hall effect in this context .",
    "if evaluated in the same naive fashion , employing the lorentz force in a classical free electron model , the result is notoriously unreliable and rarely agrees well with experiments .",
    "in fact , even the sign may be wrong  then it is referred to as the anomalous hall effect .",
    "so why is the faraday law universally accurate ?",
    "second , even disregarding these doubts , the above derivation appears to contain a logical error .",
    "its two resulting formulas are , for @xmath19 uniform , @xmath23 we may of course add both equations , obtaining @xmath24 on the left , with @xmath25 included in @xmath26 on the right , as one usually does .",
    "but we must not forget that each formula remains valid on its own .",
    "if the field is static , @xmath5 , the sum of potentials vanishes , @xmath27 , irrespective whether @xmath28 vanishes or not .",
    "if there is only one resistive element in the circuit , reducing @xmath29 to a single voltage drop @xmath30 , then both this voltage and the current will always vanish , @xmath31 . in other words , even if @xmath32 is finite , we must not write @xmath33 , as in eq  ( [ 2 ] ) , to account for faraday s observation , as this clearly violates the maxwell equation .",
    "the consideration below avoids all these difficulties and inconsistencies .",
    "we start by introducing the electric field @xmath34 of the conductor s local rest - frame .",
    "it is related to the lab - frame field @xmath35 as @xmath36 ( only terms to first order in @xmath37 are included in this paper . )",
    "note that @xmath38 is the macroscopic velocity of the medium  an unambiguous , directly observable quantity .",
    "rest - frame fields are important , because conductors strive to reduce them .",
    "as long as @xmath34 is finite , there is a current @xmath39 , which redistributes the charge to relax @xmath34 to zero . only then is the conductor in equilibrium .",
    "one could not possibly substitute @xmath11 for @xmath34 in these statements , because @xmath11 depends on the observer s frame that can be changed at will , while the conductor s equilibrium is an unambiguous fact , independent of observers .",
    "a metallic object at rest is in equilibrium if @xmath40 ; if it moves with the velocity @xmath38 , we have @xmath41 instead , so the lab - frame field is finite , @xmath42 . in any configuration such as in fig .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) that offers two inequivalent paths ,  frustration \" sets in , as the moving section strives to establish a finite potential difference , @xmath43 , by charge separation , while the stationary part attempts to eliminate it : the incompatibility of both equilibria , working hard to obstruct each other , is what gives rise to a current that flows as long as @xmath38 is finite .",
    "a limiting case is easy to see : if the resistance of the sliding bar is much larger than that of the stationary arc , see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the latter is much better able to maintain equilibrium , @xmath44 , so the current @xmath45 is approximately @xmath46  same as obtained above using the lorentz force . for a general quantitative account ,",
    "we follow landau and lifshitz  @xcite to integrate the maxwell equation in the form @xmath47 , arriving at @xmath48 identifying the conductor s velocity @xmath38 with that the area @xmath49 changes , the two terms on the left may be combined as @xmath50 , and the result is the faraday s law , properly given in terms of the rest - frame potential drops @xmath51 , @xmath52    we now revisit fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , to analyze it as two inequivalent paths characterized by two resistors , see fig .",
    "clearly , eq  ( [ 6 ] ) simply states @xmath53 as the result of the general case .",
    "note that the potential remains constant , @xmath54 , between the resistors , and there is no need for an electromotive force .",
    "a worthwhile variation contains all three elements : resistor , coil and capacitance . with @xmath55 denoting the inductivity , @xmath56 the capacitance , and @xmath57 the frequency , they are @xmath58 inserting them in eq  ( [ 6 ] ) , assuming a uniform and constant @xmath19 , denoting the relevant length of the moving wire as @xmath59 , see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , we find @xmath60i=\\vec b\\cdot(\\vec v\\times\\vec\\ell).\\ ] ] the motion of the wire ( of mass @xmath61 ) is subject to the lorentz force . for uniform @xmath38",
    ", it is given as @xmath62 combining the last two equations , we arrive at a mechano - electric pendulum , @xmath63 since both the capacitance and the moving wire contribute to the restoring force , the wire alone would suffice to form a pendulum with the inductance",
    ". clearly , the numbers are such that a conveniently observable resonance of around 1 hz seems possible  if the sliding resistance can be sufficiently reduced  @xcite .     +",
    "the validity of the faraday law , eq  ( [ 6 ] ) , is confined to wire loops , because the conductor s velocity @xmath38 was identified with the rate the area @xmath49 changes , or @xmath64 .",
    "yet the circumstance of mutually obstructing electric equilibria , giving rise to currents , occurs under rather more general conditions  including especially bulk metal .",
    "+    consider first the wire grid of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , moving with the velocity @xmath38 from a region without field into one with a finite magnetic field .",
    "one may of course apply eq  ( [ 6 ] ) for all possible loops of this grid , though it is much simpler to map it onto fig .",
    "( [ f1a ] ) , considering two inequivalent paths , the two field - exposed bars striving to establish a potential difference , and the four field - free ones working to eliminate it .",
    "each is respectively characterized by the effective resistance , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , if we take all vertical bars to be identical , with resistance @xmath15 , and neglect the contribution from the horizontal wire .",
    "the result is again eq  ( [ 6a ] ) , or @xmath67 to obtain the breaking force , we insert this expression for the current @xmath9 in eq  ( [ 10 ] ) , @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the relaxation time  which of course will change after another vertical wire moves into the field .",
    "if one of the two horizontal wires is lacking , no current at all will flow , and no breaking takes place  because there is no inequivalent paths .",
    "each portion of the wire net is happily in equilibrium by itself , without the need or possibility to obstruct that of the other portion .",
    "similar circumstances reign when a solid metal plate enters a magnetic field , because the value of the effective @xmath70 and @xmath71 decreases with the width of its region . at the beginning ,",
    "the field - exposed region is narrow , and @xmath70 is the dominating one . toward the end , when the field - free region is narrow , @xmath71 becomes large and is the one limiting the current .",
    "the largest current flows , and maximal breaking by the lorentz force occurs , when the plate is half in .",
    "no current at all flows when one of the two regions ceases to exist . if a metal comb enters the field , each tooth is in effect an electrically independent entity . due to their narrow width , the resistance is always large in comparison , so the current , the lorentz force and the breaking are always much smaller .    the next example is the eddy - current break , a piece of metal moving with @xmath38 , with only part of the metal exposed to a magnetic field .",
    "equilibrium is given by @xmath72 outside the field - exposed region , and by @xmath42 inside it .",
    "any deviation from these values churns up a current @xmath73 to re - establish them  obviously quite the same dilemma as before .",
    "the result is again a frustration - induced current , which dissipates the kinetic energy of the moving plate effectively .",
    "constant magnetic field and charge density imply the field equations : @xmath74 and the boundary conditions : @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "these have been solved  @xcite assuming constant @xmath19 , @xmath38 , and a circular field - exposed region .",
    "the result is a dipolar current field , with equal effective resistance , @xmath77 .",
    "+    finally , we discuss feynman s rocking contact  @xcite , which consists of two metal plates with slightly curved edges , such that their contact is only in one point , see the dotted lines of fig .",
    "it was presented in his lectures as an example for circumstances in which the faraday s law does not hold , with a hint that it could be analyzed with the lorentz force . however , in any bulk geometry such as the one here , there is little reason why the electron velocity @xmath78 should in any way resemble @xmath38 of the metal .",
    "so the lorentz force can not be too useful . and",
    "it is the rest - frame electric field that will again do the trick .    to understand the rocking contact ,",
    "first consider a metal wheel rotating with the angular velocity @xmath57 , in the presence of a field @xmath79 .",
    "being in equilibrium , @xmath80 , implies @xmath42 with @xmath81 , or @xmath82 , with the constant electric density , @xmath83 . assuming the wheel is neutral",
    ", there is a total surface charge of @xmath84 at the rim ( @xmath85 denotes the volume of the wheel ) .",
    "reversing the rotation also reverses the charges .",
    "next consider fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , depicting two metal wheels rotating in place , so the runner in between moves .",
    "the runner has two conducting surfaces separated by an insulating sheet .",
    "connecting the two surfaces will give rise to a one - shot current , which neutralizes the opposite surface charges of the wheels  no frustration here .",
    "oscillating the runner generates an alternating current .",
    "+    now reconsider fig  [ f4 ] , depicting either two wheels rocking against each other , or if we take away the metal behind the dotted lines , the rocking contact of  @xcite .",
    "the geometry is slightly more complex , because there is also a contribution from the translational velocity .",
    "but the basic analysis of the last example remains valid .",
    "since the rotating parts are already in contact to each other , little if any current will travel via the wires .",
    "we summarize . starting from the fact that an electric equilibrium is given only if the electric field of the local rest frame vanishes , or @xmath86 , many phenomena concerning metal parts moving in the presence of a magnetic field are shown to become easily understandable , and accessible for fully or semi - quantitative analysis .",
    "the faraday law is seen as a special case of two mutually obstructing electric equilibria , as a result of which a circular electric current is maintained .",
