    "it is reasonable to assume that the radii of neutrino spheres in sne ic are smaller than those in sne ii because of the compactness of sn ic progenitors , leading to the higher temperatures of emitted neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",

    "the @xmath2b/@xmath3b ratios inferred from current sn ic models seem to agree well with solar values .",
    "however , the frequency of sne ic , in particular with high explosion energy as assumed here , is quite low and borons in meteorites should be dominated by those originated from sne ii and galactic crs .",
    "in fact , according to @xcite the estimated frequency ratio of sne ib / c to sne ii in local spiral galaxies falls in the range of 0.41 to 0.058 and the neutrino - processed @xmath2b yield from each sn ic is at most comparable to the contribution from sn ii ( averaged value per supernova @xmath90 from @xcite ; see also the case of sn 1987a model with similar parameter set in @xcite ) .",
    "these facts lead to a conclusion that sne ic do not dominate the bulk of present @xmath2b in the galaxy .",
    "contribution from sne ic to the light element production in metal - deficient stars might be outstanding because an sn ic progenitor is surrounded by its wind material and the light elements produced in the explosion are likely to be inherited directly by next generations of stars , which would show high beb abundances overlying small amounts of beb from the other processes .",
    "an extraordinary be - rich halo star hd106038 @xcite could be a candidate star exhibiting such a process .",
    "all previous galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models included four different source components of the light element productions from primordial nucleosynthesis , agb star and nova nucleosynthesis , sne ii @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis , and galactic cr spallations and fusion ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "based on the gce studies especially of the b isotope ratio , @xcite discussed that the energy spectra of supernova neutrinos can be constrained through the avoidance of an overproduction of the @xmath2b abundance @xcite .",
    "our present result in this letter indicates that the gce model should include the fifth astrophysical component of sne ic where both @xmath0-process and cno cr spallation contribute remarkably to the production of @xmath1li and @xmath2b .",
    "the gce studies including both contributions from sne ii and sne ic are highly desirable .",
    "neutrino oscillations change neutrino flavors in stellar materials .",
    "it has been shown that light element yields in sne ii increase when the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfstein ( msw ) effect is taken into account @xcite .",
    "the contribution from charged - current @xmath0-process reactions becomes more effective in the he layer because the spectra of @xmath13 and @xmath14 shift to higher energy owing to the msw effect . in the case of sne ic ,",
    "however , the increase in the light element yields by the msw effect is expected to be small for the lack of he layer .",
    "this relates to the locations of two resonances of the msw effect .",
    "large flavor exchange occurs between @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) at the higher density resonance in the case of normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy if @xmath91 . the density of the higher resonance for a neutrino with energy @xmath92 mev is smaller than 1,600 g @xmath93 , corresponding to @xmath34 in the mass coordinate .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-process only in the outermost region in our sn ic model will be affected slightly by the msw effect .",
    "recently , neutrino oscillations with neutrino self - interactions have been investigated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flavor change by this effect occurs in deep region of sn ejecta ( @xmath94 cm ) and the abundances of light element are expected to increase in entire region of the sn ic .",
    "this is because high - energy part of the neutrino spectra plays major role in the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis where the neutrino self - interactions increase the contribution of charge current interaction in addition to the invariant neutral current interaction in the standard temperature hierarchy of supernova neutrinos which we set here @xmath95 .",
    "details of the effects of neutrino self - interactions which depend on the initial spectra , luminosity , density profile , and mixing angles of neutrinos will be discussed elsewhere .    the combined mechanism of light element production described here , i.e. the @xmath0-process and spallations , may also apply to the case of type ib supernovae where progenitor stars without h - rich envelope explode .",
    "the outermost layers of sne ib is composed of he so that the @xmath8-fusion reaction to produce lithium isotopes becomes effective .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggested that the he layers of very metal - poor stars contain primary nitrogen which was produced during the he - burning phase by the cno cycle in the h - burning shell stimulated by rotationally - induced diffusion of carbon into the h - burning shell .",
    "this strong thermonuclear reaction may enhance the light element production via spallations because the compact progenitor resulted from strong mass loss leads to more effective acceleration of ejecta by shock wave and the cross sections of spallation reactions involving nitrogen show high peak values at relatively low energy thresholds .",
    "observationally some low - metallicity halo stars were found to have high abundances of @xmath39li or @xmath40be beyond the theoretical predictions , which engages our interest in sne ib even if they might not accelerate their envelopes effectively because their progenitors are not so compact as those of sne ic .",
    "a variety of progenitor models and parameters of sn explosion will be considered in the forthcoming paper , including their contributions to the galactic chemical evolution ."
