    "the universe of galaxies beyond @xmath2 has finally become relatively easy to observe . while only a handful of galaxies at @xmath7 were known five years ago , close to 2000 have spectroscopic redshifts today .",
    "planned redshift surveys should increase the number by at least an order of magnitude in the next several years .",
    "analyzing the large and rapidly growing samples of high - redshift galaxies will be a major challenge in the coming decade .",
    "much of this analysis will rely on estimates of star - formation rates for the detected galaxies .",
    "these estimates are required to answer the most basic questions that high - redshift surveys can address  when did the stars in the universe form ? how were the sites of star formation related to the evolving perturbations in the underlying distribution of matter ?",
    "but unfortunately no standard and widely accepted techniques exist for estimating star - formation rates from the data usually available in high - redshift samples .",
    "researchers analyzing data taken at a variety of wavelengths with a variety of techniques have reached wildly discrepant conclusions about the star - formation history of the universe ( e.g. madau _ et al . _  1996",
    "; smail _ et al . _  1997",

    "the central problem is that the energy produced by star formation in young galaxies is emitted across more than 6 decades of frequency , from the far - uv to the radio , while most high - redshift surveys are based on observations at only a narrow range of frequencies .",
    "standard methods for deriving a galaxy s star - formation rate require an estimate of the total energy emitted by its massive stars , but in existing surveys this is never directly observed .",
    "radio surveys detect only the tiny percentage of the total energy that goes into accelerating electrons in supernova remnants , for example , while optical surveys detect the portion of massive stars emission that is not absorbed by dust and sub - mm surveys detect a fraction of the portion that is .",
    "large and uncertain corrections are needed to estimate the total emitted energy from the energy detected at any of these wavelengths .",
    "differences in the adopted corrections are largely responsible for current discrepancies in estimates of the star - formation history of the universe .    in principle one could obtain a robust estimate of the energy emitted by massive stars in a high redshift galaxy by observing it over a sufficiently wide range of wavelengths , but with current technology this is rarely possible .",
    "star - forming galaxies at high redshift almost certainly emit the bulk of their luminosities at far - infrared wavelengths that are extremely difficult to detect .",
    "although massive stars themselves radiate mainly in the far - uv , rapid star formation in the local universe occurs in dusty environments where most uv photons are quickly absorbed , and as a result most of the luminosity produced by massive stars tends to emerge in the far - ir where dust radiates .",
    "this is known to be true for a broad range of galaxies in the local universe , from the famous class of `` ultra luminous infrared galaxies '' ( ulirgs , galaxies with @xmath8 ) to the much fainter uv - selected starbursts contained in the iue atlas ( e.g. meurer , heckman , & calzetti 1999 , hereafter mhc ) .",
    "the recent detection of a large extragalactic far - ir background ( e.g. fixsen et al . 1998 ) suggests that it is likely to have been true at high redshifts as well .    because most of the energy produced by massive stars is likely radiated by dust in the far - ir",
    ", estimates of the bolometric dust luminosities of high redshift galaxies are required in order to estimate their star - formation rates .",
    "the bolometric dust luminosities usually can not be directly observed  the earth s atmosphere is opaque in the far - ir and most high - redshift galaxies are too faint to have been detected by any far - ir satellite that has flown  but they can be inferred from known correlations between local galaxies bolometric dust luminosities and their luminosities in the optical , mid - ir , sub - mm , and radio atmospheric windows .",
    "the first part of this paper aims to present a unified framework for estimating the bolometric dust luminosities of high - redshift galaxies selected at different wavelengths . in ",
    "2 we summarize and re - examine locally established correlations between bolometric dust luminosities and luminosities through atmospheric windows , quantifying their scatter in cases where it has not been done explicitly by previous authors . in ",
    "3 we present the limited available evidence that high - redshift galaxies obey these correlations . published estimates of the cosmic star - formation history derived from observations through one atmospheric window have often been accompanied by claims that most of the star formation could not have been detected with observations through other atmospheric windows . in the second part of this paper ,  4 , we use the results of   2 and 3 to evaluate whether this is true . after reviewing the properties of star - forming galaxies in the local universe , we discuss the properties of high - redshift galaxies selected in surveys at different wavelengths and estimate the contribution to the far - ir background from galaxies similar to those detected in optical , mid - ir , and sub - mm surveys .",
    "our conclusions are presented in  5 .    throughout this paper",
    "we shall denote luminosities by @xmath9 when they have units of energy time@xmath10 , by @xmath11 when they have units of energy time@xmath10 frequency@xmath10 , and by @xmath12 when they have units of energy time@xmath10 wavelength@xmath10 ; and observed fluxes by @xmath13 ( units of energy time@xmath10 frequency@xmath14 area@xmath10 ) or @xmath15 ( units of energy time@xmath10 wavelength@xmath10 area@xmath10 ) .",
    "the energy produced by massive stars emerges from galaxies over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "figure 1 shows typical spectral shapes of this emission for rapidly star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "massive stars radiate predominantly in the far - uv , but as galaxies become dustier an ever larger fraction of their luminosity is absorbed by dust and re - radiated in the far - ir . in typical cases",
    "most of the energy released by massive stars emerges in the far - ir .",
    "this section describes how the dust s bolometric luminosity can be estimated from observations through the atmospheric windows indicated on the @xmath16-axis of figure 1 .",
    "although a galaxy s total dust luminosity at @xmath17 can not be directly measured from the ground , narrow atmospheric windows in the sub - millimeter ( figure 1 ) allow a small fraction of it to reach the earth s surface .",
    "if dust in all galaxies radiated with the same known spectral energy distribution ( sed)say a 50k blackbody  then a galaxy s bolometric dust luminosity could be reliably estimated by simply scaling the flux measured through a sub - mm atmospheric window .",
    "unfortunately dust seds vary considerably from one galaxy to the next and are more complex than simple blackbodies . obtaining a reasonable fit to a galaxy s",
    "measured dust sed usually requires at least two `` modified '' blackbodies of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the emissivity index , is sometimes treated as a free parameter in addition to the temperatures and amplitudes of the modified blackbodies ( e.g. klaas _ et al . _",
    "the required parameters in these fits vary among galaxies in a way that is not quantitatively understood .    because of the significant variation in the shape of galaxies dust seds , measuring a galaxy s flux in one of the narrow sub - mm atmospheric windows can not precisely determine its bolometric dust luminosity .",
    "nevertheless , sub - mm fluxes provide some useful information ; galaxies with large fluxes through the sub - mm atmospheric windows tend also to have large bolometric dust luminosities . to quantify how well sub - mm flux measurements can constrain the bolometric dust luminosities of",

    "the dust seds of these galaxies are shown in figure 2 .",
    "for clarity we have connected measurements of individual galaxies at different wavelengths with spline fits ( continuous lines ) .",
    "these fits were calculated in @xmath29 space and should roughly capture the expected power - law shape of dust seds in their ( modified ) rayleigh - jeans tails .",
    "measurements from all galaxies were normalized to have the same total luminosity under the fits .",
    "this plot can be used to estimate a rapidly star - forming galaxy s bolometric dust luminosity on the basis of its luminosity at a single observed wavelength : @xmath30 where the expectation value is taken over all dust seds in the figure .",
    "table 1 lists the values @xmath31 at various wavelengths .",
    "ideally one would calculate @xmath31 by fitting two modified blackbodies to each dust sed , as discussed above , but most of the galaxies in our sample have measured fluxes at only 4 relevant wavelengths ( @xmath20 m , @xmath21 m , @xmath22 m , and @xmath4 m ) and this fit has more than 4 free parameters .",
    "instead , we estimated @xmath31 from the log - log spline interpolations shown in figure 2 .",
    "this spline fitting does not take proper account of uncertainties in the measured fluxes , but the uncertainties are almost always far smaller than the intrinsic differences in dust seds among the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the observed spread among these galaxies in @xmath32 at a given wavelength provides a measure of how reliably a flux measurement at that wavelength can constrain a galaxy s bolometric dust luminosity .",
    "the rms spread in @xmath33 , also listed in table 1 , suggests sub - mm estimates of @xmath34 will be accurate to about a factor of 2 .",
    "according to sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) and dunne _ et al . _  ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the shapes of galaxies dust seds are correlated with their bolometric luminosities , and so one might hope to estimate @xmath34 more accurately by using different values of @xmath31 for galaxies with different absolute sub - mm luminosities . unfortunately",
    "this trend does not appear to be strong enough among rapidly star - forming galaxies to substantially reduce the scatter in @xmath31 ( i.e. to substantially improve estimates of @xmath34 derived from photometry in a single sub - mm window ) .",
    "illustrating this point , figure 3 shows @xmath35 ( @xmath36 at @xmath37 m ) versus @xmath34 for each galaxy in our sample .",
    "although lirgs clearly have systematically different @xmath35 values than ulirgs , the trend disappears at lower luminosities . including an absolute luminosity dependence in @xmath38 seems unlikely to significantly improve sub - mm constraints on @xmath39 .    measuring the luminosity of a galaxy in two sub - mm bands instead of only one provides additional information about the shape of the dust sed that could in principle",
    "be used to estimate @xmath34 more accurately .",
    "unfortunately the major sub - mm atmospheric windows at @xmath25 m and @xmath4 m both lie in the rayleigh - jeans tail of typical dust seds at @xmath40 . measuring both @xmath25 m and @xmath4 m fluxes of a galaxy at these redshifts",
    "therefore reveals little about the temperature of the cold dust component and almost nothing at all about the possible presence of other dust components at higher temperatures . at larger redshifts measuring both fluxes provides better constraints on the shape of the dust sed , but even then two flux measurements can not uniquely determine the shape of dust seds that typically require more than four free parameters for a reasonable fit . in any case accurate fluxes in more than one sub - mm band",
    "are seldom available for the faint high - redshift galaxies that are our primary concern .",
    "obtaining these additional sub - mm fluxes may ultimately prove useful for more accurate estimation of galaxies bolometric dust luminosities , but we will not consider this possibility further .      at wavelengths",
    "@xmath41 m the dust emission from galaxies tends to rise significantly above the modified blackbody fits discussed in  2.1 .",
    "this excess emission is thought to originate from very small grains transiently heated by single uv - photons to high non - equilibrium temperatures ; much of it emerges in a few discrete polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) lines at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and @xmath42 m ( see , e.g. , xu _",
    "et al . _",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "@xmath43 m is often the strongest of these lines and the easiest to detect at high redshift . in this subsection",
    "we will attempt to quantify the constraints that observations through a 69@xmath44 m filter can place on a galaxy s bolometric dust luminosity .",
    "we will need this information in  3.3 below .    the sample we will use consists of 11 starbursts and 53 star - formation  dominated ulirgs observed in the mid - ir by rigopoulou",

    "in analogy to  2.1 we will define a constant of proportionality @xmath45 between bolometric dust luminosity and luminosity at @xmath46 : @xmath47 after excluding two outliers with anomalously low @xmath48 m luminosities , iras00199 - 7426 and iras20100 - 4156 , the mean value of @xmath45 among the galaxies in this sample is 52 , the mean value of @xmath49 is 0.025 , and the rms dispersion in @xmath50 is 0.22 dex .",
    "each galaxy s bolometric dust luminosity was estimated from its measured iras @xmath21 m and @xmath22 m luminosities with the relationship @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 at @xmath54 m , and @xmath55 at @xmath56 m ( e.g. , helou _ et al . _",
    "the adopted relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath57 is satisfied by the galaxies in the sample of  2.1 with an rms scatter of 7% .",
    "the estimated mean and rms of @xmath45 are not significantly altered by restricting our analysis either to galaxies with flux measurements in the sub - mm as well as at 60 and @xmath22 m or to the galaxies with the least noisy mid - ir spectra .",
    "similar values of @xmath45 are observed in galaxies with a wide range of bolometric luminosities , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the methods of estimating @xmath34 discussed so far rely on fitting an average dust sed through the observed dust emission at a single wavelength .",
    "@xmath34 can also be estimated without observing any dust emission at all .",
    "many standard methods of estimating the dust content of galaxies rely on the absorption signature of dust in the uv / optical rather than its emission in the far - ir .",
    "we will focus our attention on one of these methods , which has been shown ( see , e.g. , mhc ) to predict reasonably well the observed dust emission of local starburst galaxies .",
    "the idea behind this technique is simple .",
    "because dust absorbs shorter wavelengths more strongly than longer wavelengths , the uv continua of starbursts should become redder on average as the galaxies become dustier and the ratio of far - ir to far - uv luminosity increases . according to mhc",
    ", there is surprisingly little scatter in this trend among starburst galaxies in the local universe ; the bolometric dust luminosities of the 57 starburst galaxies in their sample obey @xmath58 where @xmath59 evaluated at @xmath60and @xmath61 is the observed spectral slope ( @xmath62 ) at @xmath63 , with a scatter of 0.3 dex . this correlation is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "observations through the radio atmospheric window can also constrain @xmath34 .",
    "increases in far - ir luminosity are accompanied , in local galaxies , by increases in radio emission with a typical spectral slope at @xmath64 of @xmath65 ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "the radio emission is thought to be synchrotron radiation from electrons in supernova remnants ; it is proportional to @xmath34 presumably because supernovae occur in the same population of massive stars responsible for heating the dust . according to condon ( 1992 ) ,",
    "galaxies without active nuclei in the local universe satisfy @xmath66 where @xmath67 at @xmath68 , with a scatter of 0.2 dex .",
    "this relationship is usually expressed in terms of the quantity @xmath57 ; the constant of proportionality in eq .",
    "5 assumes @xmath51 , as discussed in  2.2 .",
    "the local radio / far - ir relation ( eq .",
    "5 ) is unlikely to hold to arbitrarily high redshifts . at some redshift",
    "the energy density of the cosmic microwave background , increasing as @xmath69 , will become comparable to the magnetic energy density in star - forming galaxies , and relativistic electrons in supernova remnants will begin to cool through inverse compton scattering rather than synchrotron emission . for magnetic energy densities comparable to those observed among rapidly star - forming galaxies in the local universe , this will occur at @xmath70 36 ( e.g. carilli & yun 1999 ) .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief digression .",
    "carilli & yun ( 1999 ) have recently proposed the ratio @xmath71 as a photometric redshift estimator .",
    "results in this section allow us to quantify the estimator s likely accuracy .",
    "equations 2 and 5 imply @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the spectral index of the radio emission and @xmath38 can be interpolated from table 1 . calculating the mean expected @xmath74 and its uncertainty as a function of redshift",
    "is complicated by the logarithmic uncertainties and by the presence of @xmath31 in the denominator of eq . 6 . to calculate the mean expected value of @xmath74 we used @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the mean value of @xmath77 among the galaxies in  2.1 ; to calculate the ( asymmetrical ) @xmath78 uncertainties in @xmath74 we assumed that @xmath79 was symmetrically distributed around @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , the logarithmic spread in @xmath74 for galaxies at a given redshift , is the quadrature sum of the logarithmic uncertainty in @xmath38 ( from table 1 ) and the 0.2 dex scatter in the radio / far - ir correlation .",
    "if the uncertainty in @xmath79 has a gaussian distribution  as is roughly the case  this choice of @xmath44 correctly reproduces the desired mean @xmath82 .",
    "we will handle denominator terms and logarithmic uncertainties similarly throughout this paper unless stated otherwise .",
    "figure 5 shows the expected range of @xmath74 for star - forming galaxies as a function of redshift ; redshift has been placed on the ordinate to allow redshift constraints to be easily read off this figure given a measured value of @xmath74 .",
    "this figure can be used to estimate redshifts of a star - forming galaxies on the basis of their @xmath4 m and @xmath83 cm fluxes , but the estimates will be accurate only if these galaxies obey the local radio to far - ir correlation ( eq . 5 ) and",
    "have similar dust seds as the local sample of  2.1 .",
    "our next section is concerned , in part , with whether this is true ( see also carilli & yun 2000 ) .",
    "with very few exceptions , galaxies at high redshift are too faint to have been detected over the wavelength range @xmath84 by any satellite that has flown .",
    "their bolometric dust luminosities therefore can not be directly measured ; they can only be indirectly estimated with the correlations we have just described between @xmath34 and luminosities at accessible wavelengths .",
    "unfortunately the underlying physics responsible for these empirical correlations is poorly understood , and so there is no particular theoretical reason to expect them to exist in identical form at high - redshift . nor can their existence be directly established empirically , for without measuring high - redshift galaxies fluxes at several wavelengths @xmath84 it is impossible to show directly that their bolometric dust luminosities are correlated in the expected way with their fluxes through various atmospheric windows .",
    "it might therefore appear that the assumptions required to estimate high - redshift galaxies bolometric dust luminosities ( and therefore star - formation rates ) are not only questionable but also untestable ; but this is not entirely true .",
    "if a galaxy s fluxes in the rest - uv , mid - ir , sub - mm , and radio are each correlated with its bolometric dust luminosity , then they should also be correlated with each other in a way that is straightforward to calculate . observing high - redshift galaxies at more than one of these wavelengths",
    "therefore provides an indirect test of standard methods for estimating @xmath34 .",
    "these indirect tests are the subject of this section .",
    "because our ultimate goal is to estimate the @xmath4 m fluxes of known uv - selected high - redshift populations from their uv colors , our emphasis in this section will be on testing whether high - redshift galaxies have the mid - ir , sub - mm , and radio fluxes that their uv - colors and the correlations in  2 would predict .",
    "this should not give the false impression that we are testing solely whether mhc s @xmath61/far - ir relation is satisfied by high - redshift galaxies .",
    "without directly measured bolometric dust luminosities , it is impossible to test for the existence of any one of the correlations of  2 independently of the others ; they can only be tested in pairs .",
    "if @xmath3 galaxies are found to have radio fluxes at odds with our predictions from their far - uv properties , for example , it might mean that they do not obey the local @xmath61/far - ir relation , but it could equally well mean that they do not obey the local radio / far - ir relation .",
    "what we are really testing in this section is whether high - redshift star - forming galaxies are sufficiently similar to their low redshift counterparts for their bolometric dust luminosities and star - formation rates to be reliably estimated in the absence of complete photometry at rest wavelengths @xmath84 .",
    "the observations required for these tests are extremely difficult with current technology , and even though the data analyzed in this section are among the best available , much of the evidence presented is rather marginal . we have included even inconclusive evidence below when it illustrates what can ( and can not ) be learned from currently feasible observations .      the lensed galaxy smmj14011 + 0252 at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( smail _ et al . _  1998 ,",
    "frayer _ et al . _  1999",
    ") is the only sub - mm  selected object robustly confirmed to be a high redshift galaxy without an obviously active nucleus ( e.g. ivison _ et al . _  2000 ) .",

    "estimating @xmath61 from uv photometry is not entirely trivial for two reasons .",
    "first , the observed uv continua of high - redshift galaxies have been reddened by the intergalactic absorption of the lyman-@xmath91 forest , and this must be corrected before we can estimate their intrinsic continuum slopes @xmath61 .",
    "second , the uv continua of starburst galaxies are not exactly power laws , and so fitting their continua over different wavelength ranges can produce different estimates of the best fit slope @xmath61 .",
    "mhc calculated @xmath61 for galaxies in their local sample by fitting these galaxies fluxes through ten `` windows '' spanning the wavelength range @xmath92 ; nine of these windows were bluer than 1950 .",

    "to estimate @xmath61 for smmj14011 in a way that took some account of these complications , we first subjected a gissel96 model of an actively star - forming galaxy ( bruzual & charlot 1996 ) to the appropriate intergalactic absorption ( madau 1995 ) , and then reddened the resulting spectrum with increasing dust extinction following a calzetti ( 1997 ) law until this synthetic spectrum had the same @xmath88 and @xmath89 colors as smmj14011",

    "this suggests that ( typical ) individual lyman - break galaxies are unlikely to be detected with scuba , and tests of whether these galaxies have the bolometric dust luminosities predicted from their uv spectral slopes will be at best statistical .",
    "the faintness of typical lyman - break galaxies makes their sub - mm and radio fluxes difficult to predict as well .",
    "predicted bolometric dust luminosities depend sensitively on the uv spectral slope @xmath61 , and this slope is difficult to estimate accurately for faint objects with relatively large photometric errors . for example , if a galaxy at @xmath139 had @xmath140 , we would estimate ( using the method of  3.1 ) @xmath141 and @xmath142 , while if it had @xmath143 we would estimate @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "a photometric error of 0.2 in @xmath146 is not unusual for lyman - break galaxies , especially at fainter magnitudes ( e.g. adelberger _ et al . _",
    "2000 ) , and so photometric errors can easily affect our predicted sub - mm and radio fluxes by a factor of @xmath147 .",
    "the situation is worsened by the fact that the only lyman - break galaxies likely to be detectable in the sub - mm or radio are those with reddest uv slopes and highest dust obscurations .",
    "sub - samples of lyman - break galaxies selected for follow - up observations at these wavelengths will have to be chosen from among the reddest members of the population . because highly reddened lyman - break galaxies are much rarer than their less reddened counterparts ( cf .",
    "figure 12 , discussed below ) , and because the typical photometric errors on lyman - break galaxies are large , there is a reasonable chance that a lyman - break galaxy which appears to be heavily reddened is actually a less reddened galaxy with photometric errors .",

    "we first generated a large ensemble of simulated lyman - break galaxies with @xmath89 magnitudes drawn at random from the @xmath3 lbg luminosity function shown in figure 12 , uv slopes @xmath61 drawn at random from the distribution in figure 12 ( cf .",

    "finally , we placed each simulated galaxy at a random location in our @xmath88 and @xmath89 images and attempted to detect it and measure its photometry with the same software used to find real lyman - break galaxies in these images .",
    "this produced a long list of the @xmath89 magnitudes and @xmath146 colors we would expect to measure for lyman - break galaxies with known redshifts and @xmath4 m fluxes if the galaxies obeyed the local @xmath61/far - ir relation and had dust seds similar their local analogs . in order to predict the @xmath4 m fluxes shown in figure 7",

    "we have indicated in figure 7 the uncertainties in the predicted fluxes with the convention mean @xmath151 rms , but in fact these uncertainties are very skewed .",
    "the monte carlo simulations just described suggest that most lyman - break galaxies should have @xmath4 m fluxes lower than the mean value and that some will have @xmath4 m fluxes significantly larger ( how else could we have mean @xmath0 rms with the predicted fluxes bounded below by zero ? ) , and so the observations are more consistent with the predictions than figure 7 might suggest at first glance .    one way to quantify the agreement of the observations with our predictions",

    "this type of reasoning can be quantified with a version of kendall s @xmath224 generalized for censored data sets by oakes ( 1982 ) : of 500 simulated data sets we have made by scrambling the observed rank assigned to each predicted rank , only 2 had a generalized @xmath224 as large or larger than the real data set .",
    "the predicted and observed fluxes of these galaxies evidently display a significant positive correlation ; and moreover the fact that the handful of detections have observed fluxes broadly in line with their predicted fluxes suggests that this correlation is consistent with the expected linear correlation @xmath225 .",

    "we estimated rough 1.4ghz fluxes for this sample by summing the flux within a 20 radius aperture surrounding the optical centroid of each object .",
    "the measured fluxes are shown in figure 9 . for the @xmath78 uncertainty we took @xmath226jy , the observed rms when we estimated fluxes in a similar manner for random locations in richards ( 2000 ) image .",

    "the uncertainty in the predicted fluxes arises from the scatter in the @xmath61/far - ir correlation ( 0.3 dex ) , from the scatter in the far - ir / radio correlation ( 0.2 dex ) , from photometric uncertainties in @xmath212 magnitudes ( 0.1 dex ) , and from the uncertainty in @xmath61 due to photometric errors in @xmath216 ( 0.4 dex ) .",
    "added in quadrature these amount to a @xmath228 dex uncertainty in the predicted 20 cm flux for each object .    because of the large uncertainties in the predicted and observed fluxes , these data can hardly provide a rigorous test of whether @xmath2 galaxies obey the correlations between far - uv , far - ir , and radio properties observed in rapidly star - forming galaxies in the local universe . however , despite the unimpressive appearance of figure 9 , the data do strongly suggest that the predicted and observed fluxes of balmer - break galaxies are at least positively correlated : fewer than 1% of simulated data sets generated by randomly shuffling the observed and predicted fluxes had a kendall s @xmath224 as large as the observed data set .",
    "the trend of higher measured fluxes for objects with higher predicted fluxes is illustrated by the dotted crosses in figure 9 , which show the mean measured flux ( @xmath151 the standard deviation of the mean ) for objects in different bins of predicted flux .",

    "the @xmath229 galaxy hr10 initially attracted the attention of hu & ridgway ( 1994 ) because of its unusually red optical - to - infrared color .",
    "those authors suggested that hr10 was a high - redshift elliptical galaxy , but subsequent observations provided hints that hr10 was actively forming stars and suggested that its red colors might result from extreme dust reddening rather than from an aged stellar population ( graham & dey 1996 ) this interpretation has received strong support from the recent detection of hr10 at @xmath25 m and @xmath4 m .",

    "because of the large uncertainties in its rest - frame far - uv colors , we can not reliably measure @xmath61 for hr10 , but we can use its observed ratio of far - uv to far - ir luminosity to estimate the value of @xmath61 required for this object to satisfy mhc s @xmath61/far - ir relation .",
    "this slope , shown in figure 10 , is not obviously inconsistent with the data .",
    "although it is unclear if hr10 satisfies the @xmath61/far - ir relation , we can say with confidence that its ratio of far - ir to uv luminosity far exceeds that of any other galaxy discussed in this section . despite the large star - formation rate implied by its @xmath4 m flux , hr10 would not be included in most optically selected high - redshift surveys .",
    "placed at @xmath230 , for example , hr10 would be too faint and too red to satisfy commonly used `` lyman - break '' photometric selection criteria ( e.g. steidel , pettini , & hamilton 1995 ) .",
    "if most of the star formation in the universe occurred in objects like hr10 , rather than in the relatively uv - bright balmer - break and lyman - break galaxies previously discussed , then uv - selected high - redshift surveys will provide a seriously incomplete view of star formation in the universe .",
    "but this seems an unlikely possibility to us , as we will now explain .",
    "in  3 we tried to assess whether the star - formation rates of known high - redshift galaxies can be estimated from their fluxes through various atmospheric windows .",
    "our conclusions were uncertain but hopeful : the meager available evidence is at least consistent with the idea that ground - based observations can be used together with locally calibrated correlations to provide rough constraints on high - redshift galaxies star - formation rates .",
    "but estimating moderately accurate star - formation rates is only one step towards the ultimate goal of high - redshift surveys , producing a reasonably complete census of star formation at high redshift that can be used to constrain our empirical and theoretical understanding of the early stages of galaxy formation . in this section",

    "there is good reason to be concerned that the view of high - redshift star formation provided by these surveys is far from complete .",
    "few star - forming galaxies in the local universe would be included in existing surveys if they were placed at high redshift .",
    "this is illustrated by figure 11a , which shows the ratio of dust to ultraviolet luminosity for local galaxies with various star - formation rates .",
    "for this plot we have adopted @xmath231 as a crude measure of star - formation rate , though in some cases 1600  luminosities and dust luminosities can be powered by processes other than star formation . because of the different constants of proportionality in the conversions of @xmath232 and @xmath34 to star - formation rates , the quantity @xmath233 ( cf .",
    "; see also mhc ) would likely provide a better measure of star - formation rate , but in almost all cases @xmath232 is small compared to @xmath34 and our adoption of the simpler @xmath231 will not appreciably affect the subsequent discussion .",

    "the galaxies in this plot are representative of those that host the majority of star formation in the local universe : according to heckman ( 1998 ) , starbursts and spirals account for roughly equal shares of the bulk of star formation in the local universe , while lirgs and ulirgs ( galaxies with @xmath234 ) account for perhaps 6% ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",

    "are two related luminosity functions estimated in a similar manner : the expected @xmath21 m luminosity function of lyman - break galaxies ( similar in shape to their bolometric dust luminosity function ) and the `` dust corrected '' uv luminosity function ( derived by taking @xmath282 for the extinction in magnitudes at 1600 , as suggested by mhc ) .",
    "the shapes of these two luminosity distributions , both essentially equivalent to the star - formation rate distribution , are similar to what is predicted by the simplest hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( adelberger 2000 , adelberger _",
    "et al . _  2000",

    "this uncertainty is difficult to treat quantitatively .",
    "if the @xmath61/far - ir correlation does not hold these results are meaningless ; the data in  3 give us hope that it may hold ; there is little else to say .    a second source of systematic uncertainty",
    "is the unknown shape of the apparent magnitude distribution at magnitudes fainter than @xmath283 .",
    "galaxies so faint in the uv may still have large star - formation rates if they are sufficiently dusty , and so our estimate of the number density of high star - formation rate galaxies depends to some degree on the unknown number density of these faint galaxies . in our calculation above we assumed that the @xmath284 faint - end slope of the apparent magnitude distribution would continue to arbitrarily faint magnitudes .",
    "this extrapolation has a significant effect on our conclusions only at the faintest luminosities ; figure 13 shows the luminosities below which most of the estimated luminosity density comes from objects with @xmath285 .",
    "these parts of the luminosity functions should be viewed with considerable scepticism .",
    "a related source of systematic uncertainty is our assumption that the @xmath61 distribution of lyman - break galaxies is the same at all apparent magnitudes .",
    "this is known to be true only for @xmath286 ( adelberger _ et al . _  2000 ) , and so the faintest points in our inferred luminosity functions are subject to further systematic uncertainties which are difficult to quantify .",
    "this source of systematic uncertainty is negligible only at the brightest luminosities , where most of the estimated luminosity density comes from galaxies with @xmath286 ; see figure 13 .",
    "the final source of significant systematic uncertainty is the shape of the @xmath61 distribution .",
    "deriving this distribution from our data is difficult .",
    "it requires ( among other things ) a quantitative understanding of the selection biases that result from our photometric selection criteria and of the effects of photometric errors and lyman-@xmath91 emission / absorption on our measured broadband colors .",
    "our current best estimate of the @xmath61 distribution is shown in figure 12 ( adelberger _ et al . _  2000 ) .",
    "to give some idea of the systematic uncertainty in this distribution , we also show our previously published estimate ( adapted from steidel _",
    "et al . _",
    "1999 ) and the @xmath61 distribution we would derive if we neglected photometric errors and incompleteness corrections altogether and simply corrected the measured broadband colors for the spectroscopically observed lyman-@xmath91 equivalent width .",
    "the most important difference between these three distributions ( for our present purposes ) is the shape of their red tails .",
    "the true shape almost certainly falls within the range they span ; it is unlikely to be redder than the distribution of steidel _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) , and , since all known selection biases cause the lyman - break technique to miss the reddest objects at @xmath3 , it can not be bluer than the distribution that neglects completeness corrections . the luminosity functions that we would infer given these two limiting @xmath61 distributions are show in figure 13 by curved lines .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the @xmath61 distribution means that the mean extinction at 1600  for lyman - break galaxies , a factor of 6 in our best estimate , could lie between a factor of 5 and a factor of 9 .      in this section",
    "we will extend the preceding calculation to derive a crude estimate of the total contribution to the @xmath4 m background from known uv - selected populations at @xmath287 .",
    " 4.3.1 described the uncertainties affecting our calculation of @xmath3 lyman - break galaxies contribution to the @xmath4 m background . because relatively little is known about uv - selected populations at redshifts other than @xmath3 , the uncertainties in the present calculation",
    "will be much larger still . as a first approximation we can assume that these galaxies will have the same @xmath288 luminosity distribution , the same @xmath61 distribution , and the same lack of correlation between @xmath61 and @xmath288 luminosity as lyman - break galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "this is clearly an over - simplification , but the available data suggest that it might not be seriously incorrect . for example , lyman - break galaxies at @xmath289 appear to have approximately the same luminosity distribution and ( possibly ) @xmath61 distribution as lyman - break galaxies at @xmath3 ( steidel _ et al . _  1999 ) ; balmer - break galaxies at @xmath2 have far - uv spectral slopes @xmath61 that lie mainly in the range @xmath290 observed in lyman - break galaxies at @xmath3 ( adelberger _ et al . _  2000 ) ; and , like lyman - break galaxies at @xmath3 , balmer - break galaxies at @xmath2 exhibit no significant correlation of @xmath61 with apparent magnitude at rest - frame @xmath291 ( adelberger _ et al . _  2000",

    "the overall background expected from uv - selected populations in this crude calculation , @xmath300 , is close to the measured background of @xmath301 ( fixsen _ et al . _  1998 ) .",
    "the closeness of the agreement is not especially meaningful , because the uncertainties in the calculation are so large , but nevertheless it is clear that the known uv - selected galaxies at high redshift could easily have produced the @xmath0 75% of the @xmath4 m background that has not currently been resolved into discrete sources by scuba .",
    "there is little need to invoke large amounts of hidden high - redshift star formation in order to account for the brightness of the @xmath4 m background .",
    "if the bulk of the @xmath4 m background is produced by galaxies similar to those in uv - selected surveys , as we have argued , then the shape of the @xmath4 m number counts should be similar to what our calculation suggests uv selected populations would produce .",
    "this appears to be the case .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 14 compares the cumulative @xmath4 m number counts @xmath302 ( @xmath303 the number of objects per square degree brighter than @xmath13 ) measured by blain _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999b ) to the number counts that would be produced by the uv - selected high - redshift galaxies in our calculation .",
    "although there are clear differences at the brightest end , where the observed number counts receive contributions from agn , from low - redshift galaxies , and from extremely luminous high - redshift galaxies that may differ from the more normal galaxies detected in the uv , the observed number counts are remarkably close to what uv - selected populations would produce in the range @xmath304mjy that dominates the @xmath4 m background .",
    "figure 15 shows the expected contribution to the @xmath4 m background from objects with different apparent magnitudes at rest - frame 1600 .",
    "this gives a rough idea of the apparent magnitudes we would expect to measure for sub - mm sources with various fluxes if rest - frame uv - selected populations obeying the local correlations between far - uv and far - ir fluxes produced the bulk of the @xmath4 m background . at any given 850@xmath44 m flux density",
    ", objects are expected to have a wide range of redshifts and dust obscurations , and consequently of optical magnitudes , but even at the brightest @xmath4 m fluxes most objects are expected to be relatively faint ( @xmath305 ) in the optical .",
    "the observed faintness of optical counterparts to @xmath4 m sources is sometimes thought to show that the @xmath4 m background is produced by objects not present in rest - uv - selected surveys , but this argument has to be made carefully : uv - selected high - redshift galaxies are themselves quite faint in the optical , and as a result it is not sufficient to show ( for example ) that most optical counterparts are fainter than @xmath306 magnitude ; it must be shown instead that they are significantly fainter than figure 15 predicts .",
    "the available data suggest that the sources responsible for brightest @xmath4 m number counts , @xmath307mjy , are in fact significantly fainter than the predictions of figure 15 ( e.g. bcr ; frayer _ et al . _  2000 ) , and this is hardly surprising since our calculation shows that uv - selected populations can not by themselves account for the brightest @xmath4 m number counts .",
    "objects with larger obscurations @xmath308 are required and have been found . measuring the optical magnitudes of @xmath309mjy sources would provide a better test of whether uv - selected populations contribute significantly to the far - ir background , but with current technology this is possible only for lensed sources and adequate data do not yet exist .",
    "also shown in figure 15 is the contribution to the @xmath4 m background that would be produced by galaxies with @xmath310 if the @xmath311 faint - end slope of the luminosity function continued past the faintest observed magnitude of @xmath312 and if dust obscuration and reddening remained uncorrelated at the faintest magnitudes . due to the steep faint - end slope",
    ", objects with @xmath313 might be expected to contribute significantly to the @xmath4 m background .",
    "mhc have presented evidence , however , from lyman - break galaxies with @xmath314 in the hdf , that galaxies fainter in the uv tend to have lower dust extinctions .",
    "because apparent magnitude and dust obscuration are not correlated among @xmath3 lyman - break galaxies with @xmath315 , we assumed when producing figures 14 and 15 that they would remain uncorrelated at fainter magnitudes as well .",
    "mhc s analysis suggests that this assumption is incorrect : galaxies with @xmath316 are probably somewhat less dusty than we have assumed and galaxies with @xmath313 are probably significantly less dusty .",
    "when estimating the total background contribution from uv - selected populations ( figure 14 ) , we assumed as a compromise that galaxies with @xmath316 would be as dusty as galaxies with @xmath315 , and that galaxies with @xmath313 would contain negligible amounts of dust .",
    "this is obviously a very crude solution to a complicated problem ; the background contribution from objects with @xmath317 is a significant source of systematic uncertainty in figures 14 and 15 .",
    "figure 15 would be more useful for observational tests if we showed the predicted magnitudes at fixed observed - frame wavelengths , say the @xmath318 band , rather than a fixed rest - frame wavelength , but this requires us to estimate @xmath110-corrections for these galaxies and we have not found an adequate model for their uv / optical seds .",
    "the problem is illustrated by figure 16 , which shows the measured rest - frame uv / optical seds of two lyman - break galaxies detected at @xmath4 m , smmj14011 + 0252 ( smail _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) and west mmd11 ( chapman _ et al . _",
    "the optical data were obtained as described in  3.1 and in steidel _",
    "et al . _  ( 2000 ) ; the near - ir photometry was obtained with nirc ( matthews & soifer 1994 ) on keck i with excellent seeing ( @xmath319 ) in may 1999 .",
    "neither sed is fit well by a model of a continuously star - forming galaxy subjected to varying amounts of dust following a standard extinction law .",
    "moreover , even though smmj14011 + 0252 and west mmd11 have essentially indistinguishable seds in the uv  both are consistent with the same value of @xmath61their optical seds are significantly different . the shapes of galaxies uv / optical seds are strongly dependent on their star - formation histories , and perhaps the simplest conclusion to draw from figure 16 is that the star - formation histories of high - redshift galaxies are complicated and diverse . we have found no obvious way to predict their optical photometry from their uv photometry .",
    "see shapley _",
    "et al . _  ( 2000 ) for a more complete discussion .",
    "this is a good place to remind readers that our uv - based estimates of high - redshift galaxies bolometric dust luminosities are not derived from an assumed intrinsic sed and dust reddening law ; they are derived instead from the empirical ( and somewhat mysterious ) correlation between @xmath61 and @xmath320 described in  2.3 .",
    "the diversity of observed seds makes it difficult to understand why this correlation should exist , but local (  2 ) and ( less convincingly ) high redshift (  3 ) observations suggest that it does .      the major result of this section is our calculation showing that galaxies similar to those detected in uv - selected surveys probably produced a large fraction of the measured @xmath4 m background .",
    "recent analyses of @xmath4 m surveys have reached the opposite conclusion ( e.g. smail _ et al .",
    "_  1998 , hughes _ et al . _",
    "1998 , eales _",
    "et al . _  1999 ,",
    "barger , cowie , & sanders 1999 , sanders 1999 , bcr ) .",
    "skeptical readers may wonder if our calculation is robust given its apparently heavy reliance on the poorly tested assumption (  3 ) that high - redshift galaxies dust luminosities can be estimated from their uv fluxes with the correlations of  2 .",
    "although the details of our calculation certainly depend upon the assumption that high - redshift galaxies obey mhc s @xmath61/far - ir relationship , the overall background contribution from uv - selected galaxies depends primarily upon the adopted mean value of @xmath272 .",
    "mhc s relationship implies that @xmath321 for galaxies at @xmath3 , and our calculation in  4.3 showed that this factor of 8 is sufficient for uv - selected galaxies to have produced the bulk of the @xmath4 m background .",
    "high - redshift galaxies may not satisfy mhc s relationship , but the adopted @xmath322 is still a plausible estimate of their mean dust obscuration .",
    "this mean obscuration is hardly unrealistically high ; it is roughly equal to mean obscuration among the lyman - break galaxies observed in the sub - mm by chapman _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2000 ) , for example , and it is lower than the mean obscuration ( @xmath323 ) in the local uv - selected starburst sample of mhc . even the local spirals in the sample discussed before  4.1 have @xmath324 ; given the correlation of dust obscuration and star - formation rate that appears to exist at all redshifts ( cf .",
    "figures 11a  c ) , it is hard to imagine that a rapidly star - forming population at any redshift could have values of @xmath272 significantly lower than spirals in the local universe .",
    "but the fundamental difference between our analysis and the analyses of previous authors who reached opposite conclusions is not simply the value of @xmath325 adopted for uv - selected galaxies ; it is instead the assumed dependence of dust obscuration on luminosity among high - redshift galaxies .",
    "arguments for large amounts of hidden star - formation at high redshift generally assume that dust obscuration and luminosity are independent .",
    "data from low and high redshifts lead us to believe that @xmath272.5ex@xmath34 is a better approximation ( cf . figures 11a  c and 17 ) .",
    "this correlation between dust obscuration and luminosity means that the @xmath326mjy sources that produce most of the @xmath4 m background are likely to be significantly less obscured than the brighter sources currently detectable in the sub - mm .",
    "for example , if the @xmath327mjy sources studied by bcr have @xmath328 ( cf .",
    "figures 11b , c ) , then the correlation of dust obscuration and luminosity would suggest the 1mjy sources responsible for most of the @xmath4 m background have @xmath329",
    ". these sources would be dustier than typical optically selected galaxies , but they would nevertheless be as easy to detect in the optical as in the sub - mm . more generally , the correlation of dust obscuration with luminosity means that heavily obscured sources are not necessarily any harder to detect in the rest - frame uv than less obscured sources .",
    "their higher uv obscurations are largely cancelled out by their higher intrinsic luminosities .",
    "this is illustrated by figure 17 , which shows the observed uv luminosities of sources with different dust obscurations at low and high redshift . observed uv luminosities are similar for galaxies with dust obscurations @xmath272 spanning four orders of magnitude .",
    "how robust is the claimed existence of the correlation between dust obscuration and luminosity ? at low redshift , where objects dust luminosities are well constrained by iras measurements ,",
    "its existence is indisputable . at higher",
    "redshifts , dust luminosities can only be estimated with the uncertain empirical correlations described in  2 , and its existence is somewhat less secure . but even if none of the empirical correlations of  2 hold at high redshift , it is difficult to escape the conclusion that dust obscuration and luminosity are correlated . without the correlations of  2 we would not know precisely where on the @xmath16-axis to place any object in figure 17 , for example , but we would still know that iso sources are typically more luminous and more obscured than optical sources , and that scuba sources are typically more luminous and more obscured than iso sources are fainter at @xmath205 m and 20 cm than iso sources at @xmath2 ; typical @xmath2 iso sources must be fainter than typical scuba sources , or else they would over - produce the @xmath4 m number counts . ] ; and that is enough to establish the existence of the correlation .    a final and more direct argument that uv - selected galaxies contribute significantly to the @xmath4 m background comes from the work of peacock _ et al . _  ( 2000 ) , who showed that positive background fluctuations in a deep @xmath4 m image of the hdf ( hughes _ et al . _  1998",
    ") tend to be coincident with the locations of uv - selected high - redshift galaxies .",
    "their detailed analysis suggests that uv - selected populations must have produced at least one quarter , and probably at least one half , of the total @xmath4 m background .",
    "taken together the preceding arguments make a reasonably strong case that the majority of high - redshift star formation is detectable in the deepest optical surveys .",
    "but this does not imply that ir / sub - mm observations are unnecessary .",
    "although many of the results that have emerged from sub - mm surveys could have been inferred from uv data alone  the brightness of the @xmath4 m background , for instance , or the domination of the @xmath4 m background by @xmath309mjy sources ( e.g. blain _ et al . _  1999b",
    "figure 14 ) , or the @xmath0 thousand - fold increase in number density of ulirgs from @xmath1 to @xmath330 ( e.g. sanders 1999 ; cf .",
    "figure 13)some could not . for example , there was little indication from uv - selected surveys that extremely dusty galaxies with @xmath331 even existed ( cf . figure 12 ) , let alone that they hosted significant fraction ( @xmath332% ) of high - redshift star formation .",
    "observations in the ir will continue to play a central role in studies of high - redshift star formation , both as tests of the dust corrections that uv - selected surveys require and as the most efficient way to find the dustiest and most rapidly star - forming galaxies .",
    "the available evidence strongly suggests that dust in high - redshift galaxies will have absorbed most of the uv radiation emitted by their massive stars .",
    "dust certainly absorbs most of the uv radiation emitted by rapidly star - forming galaxies in the local universe , and the ratio of the far - ir to optical backgrounds shows that the situation must have been similar throughout the history of the universe . estimating the bolometric dust luminosities of high - redshift galaxies is therefore a crucial step in deriving their star - formation rates .",
    "the first part of this paper was primarily concerned with ways bolometric dust luminosities can be estimated even though most of the dust emission is blocked by the earth s atmosphere before it can be detected on the ground .",
    "we began in  2 by describing correlations between local galaxies bolometric dust luminosities and luminosities at more accessible far - uv , mid - ir , sub - mm , and radio wavelengths .",
    "these correlations provide the basis for attempts to estimate high - redshift galaxies bolometric dust luminosities .",
    "much of this section was simply a review of previously published results ; the minor new contribution was a quantification of the uncertainties involved in estimating bolometric dust luminosities from observations at a single rest wavelength @xmath333 or @xmath334 .",
    "the data suggest that radio , sub - mm , mid - ir , and far - uv estimates of local galaxies bolometric dust luminosities are all subject to a comparable uncertainty of 0.20.3 dex .     3",
    "was concerned with establishing whether the bolometric dust luminosities of high - redshift galaxies can be estimated from their fluxes through various atmospheric windows with the correlations of  2 .",
    "the evidence presented was of uneven quality .",
    "the galaxy with the highest quality observations , smmj14011 + 0252 at @xmath93 , obeyed the expected correlations nicely .",
    "the observations of more typical @xmath3 galaxies had extremely low signal to noise ratios ( @xmath138 ) , and were largely inconclusive , though at least consistent with the expected correlations .",
    "galaxies in our @xmath2 sample were bright enough in the mid - ir and radio for us to show with high significance ( @xmath22299% ) that their predicted and observed fluxes in each of these bands were positively correlated .",
    "the data suggested moreover that this positive correlation was at least broadly consistent with the expected linear correlation @xmath335 .",
    "taken together the data in this section make a plausible but still unconvincing case that the bolometric dust luminosities of high - redshift galaxies can be estimated with the expected accuracy using correlations calibrated in the local universe .",
    "our most important results were presented in the second part of this paper , ",
    "4 , where we estimated the contributions to the far - ir background from different high - redshift populations .",
    "the brightness of the @xmath4 m background provides a rough measure of the total amount of star formation at high redshift , and a significant shortfall between the background contribution from known populations and the measured background would show that existing surveys have not detected the majority of star formation at high redshift .",
    "we did not find any evidence for a shortfall .",
    "the extremely luminous objects currently detectable in the sub - mm can account for @xmath336% of the far - ir background ; the somewhat fainter galaxies detected in the mid - ir by iso can account for perhaps an additional @xmath323% ; and the galaxies detected in optical surveys can account for the remainder . attributing the far - ir background to different galaxy populations in this way obscures the fact that there is substantial overlap between galaxy populations selected at different wavelengths , especially the mid - ir and optical , but the important",
    "point is that the brightness of the @xmath4 m background is similar to what known high - redshift populations would produce if they obeyed the local correlations of  2 .",
    "this casts doubt on recent claims that the majority of high - redshift star formation is hidden from existing surveys ( e.g. lanzetta _ et al . _  1999",
    "; bcr ) .",
    "the analysis of  4 suggested that the bulk of the @xmath4 m background was produced by moderately obscured galaxies ( @xmath337 ) similar to those that host most of the star formation in the local universe and to those that are detected in uv - selected high - redshift surveys .",
    "the brightness of the @xmath4 m background is sometimes cited as evidence that most of the star formation in the universe occurred in dusty objects missing from uv - selected surveys , but this is a mistaken conclusion : the bright @xmath4 m background shows only that a large fraction of star formation occurred in dusty objects , not that it occurred in the extremely dusty objects ( @xmath338 ) that are easier to detect in the sub - mm than the far - uv . if we assumed that star formation at high redshift occurred only in known uv - selected populations and asked how dusty these galaxies would have to be to produce the observed @xmath4 m background , we would find that the mean required extinction at 1600  was a factor of @xmath339precisely the value that is generally inferred for uv - selected galaxies at @xmath2 and @xmath3 and similar to the values observed in spirals and uv - selected starbursts at @xmath1 .",
    "the brightness of the @xmath4 m background does not by itself require any star formation at all to have occurred in galaxies dustier than the moderately obscured ones ( @xmath337 ) known to contain most of the star formation in the local universe .",
    "this is not to say that extremely dusty galaxies ( @xmath340 ) do not exist .",
    "some clearly do ( e.g. dey _",
    "et al . _  1999",
    "; bcr ; frayer _ et al .",
    "part of the far - ir background is produced by them .",
    "our argument is simply that if high - redshift galaxies are similar to local galaxies in either their typical dust obscurations or their correlation of dust obscuration with luminosity , then uv - selected populations at high redshift must have contributed significantly to the @xmath4 m background ( see  4.5 ) .",
    "the fundamental difference between our analysis and the analyses of previous authors who reached opposite conclusions is the assumption made about the correlation between luminosity and dust obscuration .",
    "we have assumed that a correlation exists ; they have assumed that it does not .",
    "the assumed existence of this correlation strongly affects the amount of high - redshift star formation that is detectable in the optical , since it implies first that the @xmath341mjy sources which dominate the @xmath4 m background are likely to be less obscured than the brighter sources detectable with scuba , and second that the dustiest , most rapidly star - forming galaxies at high redshift are not necessarily any harder to detect in the uv than the less obscured sources forming stars at more moderate rates .",
    "a correlation similar to the one we have assumed is known to exist in the local universe , and in  4 we presented evidence that it exists at @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well .",
    "as illustrated by figure 17 , the high - redshift galaxies that have been detected by their dust emission are ( with few exceptions ) no fainter in the uv than the less obscured uv - selected galaxies at comparable redshifts .",
    "although we have argued that the majority of high - redshift star formation is detected in uv - selected surveys , and that many of the recent results from far - ir / sub - mm observations could have been predicted from uv observations alone ( e.g. the brightness of the @xmath4 m background , the shape of the @xmath4 m number counts , the @xmath0 thousand - fold increase in the number density of ulirgs at high redshift ) , we do not want to suggest that ir observations are unnecessary .",
    "our arguments imply on the contrary that they are indispensable .",
    "large corrections for dust extinction will be necessary in the interpretation of uv - selected surveys , and only ir observations can show whether the currently adopted corrections are valid or suggest alternatives if they are not . and",
    "the fact remains that ir / sub - mm surveys are the most efficient way to find the extremely luminous and dusty galaxies known to produce at least 5% of the @xmath4 m background .",
    "it is commonly assumed that star formation at high redshift occurs in two distinct populations of galaxies , one relatively unaffected by dust and the other completely obscured .",
    "we favor a different view .",
    "high - redshift galaxies exhibit a continuum of dust properties .",
    "some contain little dust , and some contain so much dust that they are nearly invisible in the optical ; but the majority of star formation occurs in galaxies between these two extremes , in galaxies with @xmath337 .",
    "the galaxies in this dominant population are undeniably dusty  most emit a larger fraction of their bolometric luminosities in the far - ir than in the far - uv  but with current technology they are easiest to detect in the rest - frame uv . because in most cases only a small fraction of their luminosities emerge in the far - uv , large corrections for dust obscuration are required when estimating their star formation rates .",
    "a major purpose of this paper was to show that these corrections are tractable and produce sensible results .",
    "although the validity of uv - derived dust corrections has not been convincingly demonstrated on an object - by - object basis , and further observations in the infrared are clearly required , our analysis suggests that the majority of high - redshift star formation occurs in objects which can at least be detected in existing uv - selected surveys .",
    "this is good news for those attempting to understand galaxy formation at high redshift , since it is likely that uv - selected surveys will continue to provide the most statistically robust information for at least the next decade .",
    "this paper was made possible by several researchers who generously gave us access to their data during the early stages of its publication .",

    "<S> if high - redshift galaxies resemble rapidly star - forming galaxies in the local universe , most of the luminosity produced by their massive stars will have been absorbed by dust and re - radiated as far - infrared photons that can not be detected with existing facilities . </S>",
    "<S> this paper examines what can be learned about high - redshift star formation from the small fraction of high - redshift galaxies luminosities that is emitted at accessible wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the most basic ingredient in the analysis of high - redshift surveys : the estimation of star - formation rates for detected galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> standard techniques require an estimate of the bolometric luminosity produced by their massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> we review and quantify empirical correlations between bolometric luminosities produced by star formation and the uv , mid - ir , sub - mm , and radio luminosities of galaxies in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations suggest that observations of high - redshift galaxies at any of these wavelengths should constrain their star - formation rates to within @xmath0 0.20.3 dex . </S>",
    "<S> we assemble the limited evidence that high - redshift galaxies obey these locally calibrated correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the second part of the paper assesses whether existing surveys have found the galaxies that host the majority of star formation at high redshift even though they directly detect only a small fraction of the luminosities of individual galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the characteristic luminosities and dust obscurations of galaxies at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . after discussing the relationship between the high - redshift populations selected in surveys at different wavelengths , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the contribution to the @xmath4 m background from each and argue that these known galaxy populations can together have produced the entire observed background . </S>",
    "<S> the available data show that a correlation between star - formation rate and dust obscuration @xmath5 exists at low and high redshift alike . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of this correlation plays a central role in the major conclusion of this paper : most star formation at high redshift occurred in galaxies with moderate dust obscurations @xmath6 similar to those that host the majority of star formation in the local universe and to those that are detected in uv - selected surveys . </S>"
