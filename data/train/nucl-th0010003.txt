    "the theoretical description of the relativistic @xmath0-body problem is an interesting but perplexing problem in nuclear and particle physics .",
    "it involves the possibility of relativistic bound states of composite particles on the one hand and the reaction matrix elements between these particles at high energies on the other hand .",
    "the relativistic @xmath0-body problem is complicated by the fact that the relativistic bound state problem is basically non - perturbative in nature and can not be solved by the conventional perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "one also needs to describe the reaction process relativistically by making use of the results from the bound states .",
    "much progress has been made in the study of relativistic two - body bound state problems @xcite . in the 1970s , several authors used dirac s constraint mechanics @xcite to attack the relativistic two - body problem at its classical roots @xcite , successfully evading the so - call `` no interaction theorem '' @xcite .",
    "the quantum version of the constraint approach was extended to pairs of spin one - half particles .",
    "the results were two - body quantum bound state equations that correct the defects in the breit equation , correct the defects in the ladder approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation , and control covariantly the relative time and energy variables @xcite .",
    "those bound state equations for fermions are the two - body dirac equations of constraint dynamics , which we shall also call the constraint equations @xcite .",
    "they possess a number of important desirable features , some of which are unique .",
    "for example , they remove the deficiencies of earlier approaches in which the spin dependence of the potentials is a patchwork of semirelativistic corrections determined by field theory@xcite . in contrast , the spin dependence in constraint dynamics is determined naturally by the dirac equation structure of each of the constraint equations together with the assumed covariant interactions @xcite .",
    "the equations of constraint dynamics are manifestly covariant while yielding simple three - dimensional schrdinger - type equations , like those of their nonrelativistic counterparts@xcite .",
    "( this particular feature will ultimately be of crucial importance in the discussions given in this paper . )",
    "these constraint equations have passed numerous tests showing that they reproduce correct qed perturbative results when solved nonperturbatively@xcite .",
    "in addition , the dirac forms of these equations automatically make it unnecessary to introduce _ ad hoc _ cutoff parameters , which are needed in most other approaches @xcite to regularize singular potentials .",
    "the relativistic potentials appearing in the constraint equations are related directly to the interactions of perturbative quantum field theory . in non - perturbative qcd",
    "as applied to meson spectroscopy , they may be introduced phenomenologically @xcite and can be regarded as an anticipation of potentials that may eventually emerge from lattice gauge theory .    in the present paper",
    "we will extend the constraint equations beyond the scope of the two - body problem and will , for simplicity , limit ourselves to the constraint description of spinless particles .",
    "we first summarize the constraint approach for two spinless particles .",
    "for each particle , one ascribes a generalized mass shell constraint which includes the interaction .",
    "the constraints must be consistent with each other and this in turn restricts the dependence of the interactions on the relative coordinates , eliminating both the relative time and energy variables in the cm system .",
    "the resultant equations correspond to a bethe - salpeter equation whose kernel and green s functions are constrained by the requirement of @xmath1 = 0 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the total and relative momenta of the two - body system @xcite . in particular , from the bethe - salpeter equation with this constraint , one can derive @xcite the `` quasipotential equation '' of todorov@xcite , which is a schrdinger - like inhomogeneous integral equation where the quasipotential @xmath4 is related to the scattering amplitude in perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "other methods of reducing the bethe - salpeter equation have also been suggested @xcite .    at present , the relativistic treatment of the @xmath0-body problem and the reaction of composite particles at high energies have not advanced as much as in the relativistic treatment of two - body bound states .",
    "an investigation of the relativistic @xmath0-body problem was previously carried out by sazdjian @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the non - relativistic @xmath0-body problem and the non - relativistic description of the reaction of composite particles have been well developed @xcite .",
    "one has , for example , the distorted - wave born approximation method in nuclear reactions @xcite and the quark - interchange model in hadron reactions @xcite for reactions between composite particles .",
    "one first solves for the wave functions and determines the interaction between the constituents using the energy levels of bound states .",
    "then one uses the same set of interactions and wave functions to calculate the reaction matrix elements for the reaction of composite particles .",
    "there is also the potentially different values of the post or prior forms of the reaction matrix element , which distinguish whether the interaction occurs before the rearrangement or after the rearrangement of the constituents .",
    "the post - prior equality of the reaction matrix elements is attained when the interaction and wave functions that are used in the calculation of the overlap integral are the same as the interaction and the wave functions obtained in the bound state analysis .",
    "the formalism we shall develop can be applied to many processes of interest .",
    "for example , in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , the investigation of the dynamics and the properties of the produced hadron matter involve the reaction cross sections and the reaction matrix elements between the produced hadrons at relativistic energies . most of these cross sections and reaction matrix elements can not be measured experimentally . a reliable theoretical relativistic model which describes the @xmath0-body problem of the constituents",
    "is needed for their evaluation .",
    "it is necessary to generalize the nonrelativistic reaction model to study reactions between composite particles at relativistic energies .",
    "it is also of interest to study the relativistic @xmath0-body problem in order to investigate an assembly of composite particles and their clustering or molecular states .",
    "we shall take advantage of previous advances in the understanding of the relativistic two - body problem in our present study of the relativistic @xmath0-body problem . in this work ,",
    "we specialize in @xmath0-body dynamics with just pair - wise interactions between particles .",
    "we shall write down the hamiltonian formulation of the relativistic @xmath0-body problem which allows an easy separation in terms of the center - of - mass and the relative motion for any two - body system and a simple separation of the unperturbed hamiltonian and the residual interaction .",
    "we can then use the relativistic two - body bound states as basis states for the investigation of the relativistic @xmath0 -body problem .",
    "we can construct a proof of the `` post - prior '' equivalence in relativistic dynamics , which guarantees that the reaction matrix element is independent of the different ways of partitioning the unperturbed hamiltonian and the residual interaction from the @xmath5body hamiltonian .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review important aspects of the constraint approach and introduce the relativistic two - body hamiltonian and bound state eigenvalue equation .",
    "we show that the relativistic two - body solution in the cm rest system has the simplicity of its nonrelativistic counterparts . in section iii",
    "we generalize the two - body hamiltonian to the case of @xmath0 particles .",
    "we discuss some applications of the present formulation in section iv .",
    "we show how to utilize the constituent two - body wave functions for the @xmath0-body problem . because of the analogy to their nonrelativistic counterparts ,",
    "these states can be used as basis states to evaluate a general reaction matrix element in the general @xmath0-body problem .",
    "we prove the relativistic version of the post - prior equivalence for the reaction matrix elements . as an illustration and a problem of practical interest , we consider in section v the reaction of four particles in two composite systems where",
    "the non - relativistic treatment has already been formulated by barnes and swanson @xcite . in section",
    "vi , we explicitly obtain the wave function in second - quantized form so as to construct the overlap integral for the reaction matrix element .",
    "such a reaction matrix element involves states of composite particles in motion .",

    "it is interesting to note that compared to the nonrelativistic case , the overlap matrix element now involves two major differences .",
    "first , the momentum arguments in the wave function need to be inversely boosted back to the frame in which the composite particles are at rest , as they should be .",
    "second , there are factors of the type @xmath347 appropriate for the composite particle in the collider frame",
    ". both effects can lead to substantial modification of the magnitude of the reaction cross sections .",
    "we seek a relativistic formulation of the many - body problem involving both bound states and reaction between constituents of composite particles . as a first example , we have focused our attention on a system of spinless particles interacting with a scalar and/or vector interaction .    we began by examining the relativistic two - body bound state problem and introduced lagrangian multipliers to write down the most general two - body hamiltonian . the formulation using",
    "the constraint dynamics allowed a simple separation of the center - of - mass and the relative motion .",
    "a two - body equation was obtained in the form of a non - relativistic schrdinger equation which connects naturally to the corresponding non - relativistic problem in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the two - body equation is independent of the lagrange multipliers .",
    "the bound state mass is related to the eigenvalue of the non - relativistic problem by a simple algebraic equation in the case in which one considers only relativistic kinematics .",
    "further relativistic effects show up in this algebraic relationship when the energy dependence accompanying the scalar and vector interaction is taken into account .    for a many - particle system",
    ", we considered pair - wise interaction between particles . in constructing the total hamiltonian , a good choice of the lagrange multiplier provides a simple way to separate the @xmath0-body hamiltonian into the unperturbed hamiltonian and residual interactions .",
    "it also presents a systematic way to use the two - body solution as basis states for multi - particle dynamics .",
    "the study of the dynamics involves the evaluation of the reaction matrix elements of a general two - body interaction in terms of the wave functions of the composite particles .    in rearrangement reactions ,",
    "because there can be many ways to divide the total hamiltonian , the evaluation of the reaction matrix elements should not depend on the choice of the unperturbed hamiltonian and basis states . with our formulation , this `` post - prior '' equivalence can be shown explicitly , allowing for a meaningful definition of the perturbation expansion and treatment of the reaction dynamics .",
    "finally , we give an explicit formula for the reaction matrix elements in terms of the composite wave functions . in the relativistic treatment ,",
    "the important effects include the inverse boost of the relative momentum to the frame in which the composite particles are at rest , so as obtain the correct wave function . furthermore , there are factors of @xmath347 in the collider frame for the composite particles",
    ". these relations will be useful when we apply the present formulation to many problems in nuclear and particle physics such as meson - meson scattering .",
    "an aim would be to see how this approach modifies the results of the nonrelativistic formalism as present in @xcite .",
    "the results we have obtained are very encouraging .",
    "we should in future work carry out a calculation for the relativistic @xmath348 @xmath349@xmath349 scattering , to compare with the non - relativistic results of barnes and swanson @xcite and with experimental data",
    ". we should also extend our considerations to include the spin degree of freedom and more complicated interactions in the constraint description .",

    "let us consider the general scalar product @xmath350 @xmath351 where @xmath352 @xmath353    now the total momentum delta function makes @xmath354 , which in turn implies that the two delta functions that come from the creation and annihilation operator force the arguments of the two wave functions to be the same .",
