    "for more than 30 years the microscopic description of nuclear ground state properties is relying on the self - consistent mean field approach , or hartree - fock ( hf ) approach built from effective in - medium nucleon - nucleon interactions@xcite .",
    "the most popular interaction is the skyrme - type interaction@xcite whose analytic form leads to considerable simplifications of the hf calculations in finite nuclei .",
    "the general point of view is that the skyrme interaction is a phenomenological one whose parameters are directly adjusted on a few selected observables taken from infinite matter and some doubly - magic nuclei . in its most sophisticated versions , the skyrme - type force can predict binding energies of all measured nuclei with an overall error of less than 0.7 mev@xcite .",
    "other parametrizations try to improve the description of systems with a large neutron excess@xcite by incorporating constraints from variational calculations performed for neutron - rich and pure neutron matter@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , important progress have been made in the recent years concerning brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) calculations of infinite matter@xcite . for many years",
    ", a major drawback of the bhf approach was that the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter could not be reproduced if one starts with only a realistic two - body bare interaction ( the so - called coester line problem ) .",
    "this is the reason why in the early attempts to derive from a brueckner g - matrix an effective interaction suitable for hf calculations of finite nuclei it was necessary to renormalize phenomenologically the g - matrix@xcite .",
    "two recent achievements have led the bhf approach to a quite satisfactory status : one is that the convergence of the hole - line expansion has been proved to occur already at the level of three - body correlations@xcite ; the other one is that the inclusion of three - body forces improves to a large extent the prediction of the saturation point@xcite .",
    "thus , it is timely to re - examine how one can relate the bhf description of homogeneous matter to a hf description of finite nuclei .",
    "our strategy is to look for a skyrme - like parametrization adjusted so as to reproduce the bhf results calculated in symmetric nuclear matter and also spin- and isospin polarized matter , then to examine the hf predictions of this parametrization in nuclei . in our approach",
    "it is possible to determine all the parameters of the force except the two - body spin - orbit parameter @xmath0 because this component of the force gives no contribution in homogeneous matter .",
    "this will remain an adjustable parameter when calculating finite nuclei , and its value is fixed on the @xmath1 splitting in @xmath2o as it is usually done .",
    "of course , the two - body coulomb interaction has also to be added .    in a recent work ,",
    "baldo et al.@xcite have studied the relation between the brueckner results in infinite matter and some of the skyrme parameters , but the number of constraints used was insufficient to determine the velocity - dependent part of the skyrme force , which is a very important part since it governs the effective mass behaviour .    in this work",
    ", we start from the recent bhf calculations of refs.@xcite extended to spin- and isospin polarized homogeneous matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii a brief review of relevant bhf predictions is given .",
    "in sec.iii we explain how the skyrme parameters are determined .",
    "sec.iv presents and discusses the hf results obtained for selected closed - shell nuclei . concluding remarks",
    "are given in sec.v .",
    "for densities around the saturation value and smaller , the bhf approximation , in which the energy shift is truncated at two hole - line level , is a quite good approximation . in that region in fact we are allowed to neglect the three - body correlations , which anyhow give a small contribution when adopting the continuous choice for the auxiliary potential@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the bhf approximation embodies both the inert core pure bhf mean field and the core polarization term , the latter arising as rearrangement potential@xcite .",
    "thus , the main effects of the correlations on the effective mass will be taken into account .",
    "the fit of the microscopic effective mass is a qualifying aspect of the present parametrization , since this quantity is one of the least well constrained properties of the phenomenological skyrme forces@xcite .",
    "let us briefly review the salient features of the bhf equation of state ( eos ) :    _ i ) saturation point _",
    "the bhf approach with only two - body force sizeably overestimates the saturation density@xcite .",
    "this is commonly attributed to the missing effect of the three body force in the region above the empirical saturation density . after introducing a three body force in the calculations the saturation density",
    "is improved without appreciable change of the corresponding energy . in the most recent brueckner",
    "calculations@xcite it was estimated , @xmath3 , still beyond the range of the empirical values of the central density of nuclei , and the energy @xmath4 .",
    "the main effect of such a failure is expected to appear in the calculation of the neutron and proton density profiles .",
    "+ _ ii ) effective mass _ + the nucleon effective mass inside the medium is an outcome of the bhf approach and as such , it must be reproduced by the equivalent skyrme parametrization .",
    "it is related to the momentum dependence of the on - shell self - energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the quasiparticle energy .",
    "it plays an important role not only in the theoretical description of the transport phenomena , including heavy ion collision ( hic ) simulations , but also for the level density of nuclei .",
    "recently the isospin splitting of the effective mass has been the subject of some debate since different approaches predict contradictory results @xcite . in the framework of the brueckner approach it is possible to trace the isospin splitting of the effective mass back to properties of the bare nuclear interaction @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the neutron effective mass is linearly increasing with the neutron excess while the proton effective mass is symmetrically decreasing . embodying the neutron and proton effective masses in the fit one may expect important isospin effects in observables which are sensitive to the effective mass itself .",
    "iii)_symmetry energy _",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath7 has stimulated a lot of interest for its relevance in hic physics , nuclear astrophysics and exotic nuclei .",
    "in fact it is related to the isospin splitting of effective mass , neutron and proton mean fields , etc ... in particular , the neutron skin in neutron - rich nuclei seems to be very sensitive to the details of the density dependence of @xmath7@xcite . in the microscopic approaches ,",
    "the saturation point becomes less and less stable with increasing neutron excess and at some critical point , before reaching the conditions of pure neutron matter , it disappears .",
    "this transition formally amounts to the transition from a minimum to an inflexion point in the function @xmath8 .",
    "correspondingly the symmetry energy would also exhibit an inflexion point as a function of density .",
    "this entails that any parametrization of @xmath7 such as @xmath9 , which is often adopted in calculations , is not suitable to reproduce this behavior .",
    "this seems to be the case with the skyrme forces . in the bhf approximation",
    "the symmetry energy at the saturation point turns out to be @xmath10 @xcite . at low density",
    "it is independent of the force @xcite and therefore it can be considered well established from a quantum - mechanical many body theory . above",
    "the saturation point the three body force has a strong influence on the symmetry energy .",
    "the bhf prediction is in a rather good agreement with the relativistic dirac - brueckner@xcite but both diverge from variational calculations@xciteand also from some skyrme forces ( for a discussion , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the structure of neutron stars has been addressed as a possible constraint for the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter and , in particular , for the symmetry energy , but so far the calculations do not give a definite answer .",
    "+ iv ) _ landau parameters _ + in order to have a full determination of the skyrme - force parameters and not only some combinations of them , it is not sufficient to fit bulk properties such as binding energies , effective masses and symmetry energy , as we shall see in sec.iii .",
    "we will use the additional constraint of reproducing the @xmath11 landau parameter extracted by extending the bhf calculations to spin and isospin asymmetric nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "the brueckner predictions for the landau parameters@xcite have proved to reproduce the existing experimental data ; in particular the parameter @xmath12 is consistent with the centroid energy of the gamow - teller giant resonance@xcite .",
    "so far only the values of the landau parameters at the saturation point can be tested . at lower density",
    "experimental information can come from the study of giant resonances in exotic nuclei .",
    "the standard form of the skyrme effective interaction is : @xmath13 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + t_2(1+x_2p_{\\sigma})\\mathbf{p}'\\cdot\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{p } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{6}t_3(1+x_3p_{\\sigma})[\\rho(\\mathbf{r})]^{\\sigma}\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\nonumber \\\\ & & + i w_0\\bf{\\sigma } \\cdot [ \\mathbf{p}'\\times\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{p } ] ~ , \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the relative coordinate of the two particles and @xmath15 the center of mass coordinate .",
    "@xmath16 is the relative momentum acting on the right , and @xmath17 its conjugate acting on the left .",
    "@xmath18 is the spin - exchange operator .",
    "the force parameters are the @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the power @xmath21 of the density dependence , and the spin - orbit strength @xmath0 .",
    "as already mentioned , the latter parameter will be adjusted phenomenologically in some specific nucleus . as for the @xmath21 parameter , it is difficult to extract it in a unique way just from nuclear matter bulk properties . in the literature",
    "there are several classes of skyrme forces characterized by the value of @xmath21 , the most common values being 1/6 , 1/3 , 1 . since we do not have enough constraints from bhf calculations of nuclear matter to determine all the free parameters , we choose to adopt in this work @xmath21=1/6 and to concentrate on finding the remaining parameters .",
    "the basic inputs of this work are the results of the bhf self - energy which includes the core polarization term ( called in the literature extended bhf approximation ( ebhf)@xcite ) and the eos with two and three - body forces@xcite .",
    "the procedure to determine the force parameters proceeds through three main steps .",
    "the first step concerns the fit of the nucleon effective mass in symmetric and non - symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this enables one to find the values of two important combinations - @xmath22 and @xmath23 - of @xmath24 . in the second step",
    "we look at the energy per particle in symmetric and non - symmetric nuclear matter as a function of total density and neutron - proton asymmetry .",
    "the fit of these quantities determines several families of ( @xmath25,@xmath26 ) parameters . in the last step",
    ", we make use of the constraints imposed by the value of the @xmath11 landau parameter and by a combination of parameters governing the surface properties of finite nuclei . in this way ,",
    "the remaining parameters @xmath24 are uniquely determined for each parameter family since we already know the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "because the fit of bhf bulk properties has been supplemented with the surface condition one may hope that the parameter sets thus obtained could describe reasonably well finite nuclei .      in symmetric nuclear matter",
    ", the isoscalar effective mass of a nucleon has the following expression ( here and in the rest of this paper we follow the same notations as in ref.@xcite ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "one can also define an isovector effective mass as @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "in asymmetric nuclear matter with an asymmetry parameter @xmath31 , the nucleon effective mass is @xmath32 with @xmath33 for neutrons and @xmath34 for protons .    to obtain @xmath22 we fit the values of the nucleon effective mass calculated in symmetric nuclear matter in ebhf approximation@xcite with the three - body force effects included .",
    "the fit is illustrated in fig.1 , and the resulting value from the fit is @xmath35 mev @xmath36 .",
    "next , we can determine @xmath23 by fitting @xmath37 calculated in asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the fits are shown in fig.2 , and the corresponding value of @xmath23 is @xmath38 mev @xmath36 . actually , the fits of @xmath37 remain good beyond @xmath39=0.4  .     in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -3.cm    at this point we can already make an interesting observation .",
    "some skyrme parametrizations of the literature predict that , for a fixed density , the proton and neutron effective masses are respectively an increasing and decreasing function of the asymmetry parameter @xmath39@xcite .",
    "this behaviour is opposite to that predicted by ebhf calculations@xcite . in fig.3",
    "we show a comparison of effective masses calculated with the parameter set sly4@xcite and with our values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus , our skyrme parametrization will differ from some usual parametrizations as far as the isospin splitting of effective masses is concerned .",
    "recently , it was pointed out@xcite that effective masses obtained in dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock have a similar behaviour to that of ebhf , and opposite to that of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model .",
    "it must also be noted that , if one includes the fock terms in a relativistic hartree - fock description , the trend of the neutron - proton mass splitting becomes closer to that of the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock and therefore , the behaviour of the rmf mass is due to the omission of exchange terms@xcite .     in asymmetric nuclear matter , at two different asymmetries .",

    "we first start with the case of symmetric matter .",
    "the fit of the bhf values of @xmath43 determines several possible values for the couple ( @xmath44 ) . to limit the number of possible couples we impose that the compression modulus @xmath45 must be between 200 and 240 mev , and the pressure @xmath46=0 at the saturation density @xmath47 .",
    "the optimal parameter sets we find have @xmath45 around 210 mev . as for @xmath47",
    "it is about 0.18@xmath48 in the bhf calculation with three - body force@xcite , a value somewhat larger than that usually adopted for skyrme parametrizations .",
    "the consequence will be a general underestimate of radii in finite nuclei as we shall see in sec.iv  .    for each ( @xmath44 )",
    "couple previously determined we add the constraints of fitting @xmath49 as well as the symmetry energy @xmath7 of infinite matter calculated in bhf . in terms of skyrme parameters",

    "the pure neutron matter case , which is not included in the fitting procedure , is also shown to demonstrate that the present skyrme parametrizations describe reasonably well the bhf energies per particle in the whole range of @xmath39 from 0 to 1 and for densities up to the highest bhf calculated values around 0.35 @xmath48 .",
    "however , one can see that the skyrme energy functional is not able to reproduce accurately the eos of pure neutron matter which exhibits an s - shaped behaviour .",
    "this suggests that a change of the analytical structure of the energy functional would be necessary . in fig.5",
    "is shown the fit of bhf symmetry energy .",
    "the deviations observed in the neutron matter case in fig.4 reflect in the fit of the symmetry energy since the symmetry energy is calculated from the expression @xmath56 , and then a bad fit for the neutron matter eos induces a bad fit for @xmath57 .    to summarize , the bulk properties of nuclear matter have enabled us to determine several sets of ( @xmath53 ) parameters and the values of the parameter combinations @xmath22 and @xmath23 for a fixed value @xmath21=1/6 of the density dependence . to complete the task we proceed to determine the remaining parameters @xmath58 in the next subsection .",

[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the bulk nuclear matter properties give only the two parameter combinations @xmath22 and @xmath23 . to proceed further , we can use some additional constraints from the landau parameters corresponding to our reference ebhf calculation .",
    "these landau parameters have been investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the two parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related to the compression modulus and symmetry energy , respectively , which are already incorporated into the preceding constraints .",
    "then , only @xmath11 and @xmath12 are left as constraints , and in principle they are enough to determine the four remaining parameters .",
    "however , we prefer to use as constraint only one of them and keep some freedom to better optimize the surface properties of finite nuclei .",
    "indeed , the surface effects can not be determined from infinite matter calculations and we need to adjust these surface effects by performing skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) studies of some selected nuclei",

    "we choose as reference nuclei the closed - shell and closed - subshell nuclei @xmath2o , @xmath66ca , @xmath67ni , @xmath68zr , @xmath69sn , @xmath70pb .",
    "we vary @xmath71 in a range of values similar to that of usual skyrme forces , and for each value we obtain a set of @xmath58 with which we can perform a shf calculation of the reference nuclei .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath0 is obtained by adjusting the @xmath72 proton splitting in @xmath2o . in this way",
    ", we can determine the set which gives the best overall results for binding energies and radii in the reference nuclei .",
    "table i summarizes the outcome of the fit .",
    "the full parameter set is called lns . in the lower part of table",
    "i are shown the main bulk properties of nuclear matter calculated with lns .",
    "it can be noted that @xmath47 is larger and the saturation energy is slightly less negative than the empirical saturation point ( 0.16 @xmath48 , -16 .",
    "the consequence is that , in finite nuclei central densities will tend to be too large and radii become systematically underestimated .",
    "we now discuss the results of hf calculations of finite nuclei made with the lns parametrization .",
    "the parameter set of table i is supplemented with the two - body coulomb force .",
    "the coulomb exchange contributions are treated in the slater approximation .",
    "the center of mass correction to the total energy is approximated in the standard way , keeping the one - body and dropping the two - body terms@xcite .",
    "the hf equations are solved in the radial coordinate space , assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "we choose to test the lns parametrization on the following set of closed - shell and closed - subshell nuclei : @xmath2o , @xmath73ca , @xmath74ca , @xmath75ni , @xmath76ni , @xmath68zr , @xmath77sn , @xmath78sn , and @xmath70pb .",
    "the lns force has not been fitted on finite nuclei and therefore , one can not expect a good quantitative description at the same level as purely phenomenological skyrme forces . it is nevertheless interesting to compare its predictions with those of a commonly used force like the sly4 interaction . in fig.6",
    "are shown the relative deviations of charge radii ( upper panel ) and energies per particle(lower panel ) calculated with lns and sly4 .",
    "as for the binding energies , one can see that lns is doing reasonably well in the ca and ni regions but it is underbinding somewhat @xmath2o and overbinding the medium and heavy nuclei , the discrepancies remaining within a 5% limit .",
    "the sly4 force is doing of course much better since it is adjusted on doubly magic nuclei .",
    "the deviations of the lns energies can be attributed to the incorrect saturation point of the bhf equation of state , and also to the lack of information concerning surface properties that one should fulfill .",
    "the charge radii of lns exhibit a systematic behaviour of underestimating the data by 2 to 4% .",
    "this can be understood again as a consequence of the bhf saturation point being shifted towards a larger density .",
    "then , the central density in nuclei calculated with lns becomes larger than what it should be and this reduces the spatial extension of nuclear densities .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.7 where we show the neutron and proton distributions in @xmath70pb calculated with lns and with sly4 .",
    "-3.cm    pb , calculated with lns and sly4 parametrizations.,title=\"fig : \" ] -3.cm    o.,title=\"fig : \" ] -3.cm    finally , we would like to comment on the spin - orbit component of the lns parametrization since this is the only parameter that we could not relate to the ebhf calculation .",
    "we have fitted it to reproduce the experimental @xmath79 spin - orbit splitting of neutron and proton levels in @xmath2o .",
    "the value @xmath0=96.@xmath80 that we find seems somewhat smaller than for other skyrme forces where @xmath0 usually ranges from 105 . to 130.@xmath80 . in fig.8",
    "we show that the spin - orbit potentials in @xmath2o calculated with lns and sly4 are nevertheless very close and they must give the same spin - orbit splitting .",
    "in this work we have derived a skyrme - type parametrization of an effective interaction suitable for hartree - fock calculations of finite as well as infinite systems .",
    "the starting point is the bhf calculations of infinite nuclear matter at different densities and neutron - proton asymmetries .",
    "these bhf studies include effects of three - body forces and consequently , the equation of state is much more satisfactory than with only two body force , and the saturation point becomes closer to the empirical point .",
    "this gives a good motivation for looking for a simple effective interaction - or energy density functional - whose parameters are determined by the bhf results .",
    "we have paid special attention to the effective mass properties in order to get constraints on the velocity - dependent part of the effective force .",
    "we find that , if a skyrme force obeys the ebhf effective mass constraints then the neutron and proton effective masses are respectively increasing and decreasing when the asymmetry @xmath39 becomes larger , a behaviour not always obeyed by usual skyrme forces , but consistent with empirical optical potential models@xcite",
    ".    the lns force that we have thus obtained works reasonably well for describing finite nuclei in the hf approximation .",
    "the deviations from the data remain at the level of a few percent for binding energies and radii .",
    "if the bhf results could be improved with respect to the equilibrium point of the equation of state , then the hf results of finite nuclei would most probably become much more satisfactory . in any case , it is highly desirable to establish a link between microscopic many - body theories which are carried out in infinite systems and phenomenological approaches for finite nuclei based on effective interactions .",
    "the present work is one step into this direction ."
