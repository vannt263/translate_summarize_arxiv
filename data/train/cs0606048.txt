    "we present a method of hierarchical clustering based on a novel fast randomized hill - climbing heuristic of a new global optimization criterion . given a the weights of all quartet topologies , or a matrix of the pairwise distances between the objects , we obtain an output tree with the objects as leaves , and we score how well the tree represents the information in the distance matrix on a scale of 0 to 1 .",
    "as proof of principle , we experiment on three data sets , where we know what the final answer should be : ( i ) reconstruct a tree from a distance matrix obtained from a randomly generated tree ; ( ii ) reconstruct a tree from files containing artificial similarities ; and ( iii ) reconstruct a tree from natural files of heterogenous data of vastly different types .",
    "we give examples in whole - genome phylogeny using the whole mitochondrial dna of the species concerned , in sars virus localization among other virri , and in analyzing the spreading of the bird - flu h5n1 virus mutations .",
    "we compare the hierarchical clustering of our method with a more standard method of two - dimensional clustering ( to show that our dendrogram method of depicting the clusters is more informative ) .",
    "the new method was developed as an auxiliary tool for @xcite , since the available quartet tree methods were too slow when they were exact , and too inaccurate or uncertain when they were statistical incremental .",
    "our new quartet tree heuristic runs orders of magnitudes faster than any other exact quartet tree method , and gives consistently good results in practice .",
    "* relation with previous work : * the minimum quartet tree cost ( mqtc ) problem below for which we give a new computational heuristic is related to the quartet puzzling problem , @xcite .",
    "there , the quartet topologies are provided with a probability value , and for each quartet the topology with the highest probability is selected ( randomly , if there are more than one ) as the maximum - likelihood optimal topology . the goal is to find a bifurcating tree that embeds these optimal quartet topologies . in the biological setting it is assumed that the observed genomic data are the result of an evolution in time , and hence can be represented as the leaves of an evolutionary tree . once we obtain a proper probabilistic evolutionary model to quantify the evolutionary relations between the data we can search for the true tree . in a quartet method",
    "one determines the most likely quartet topology under the given assumptions , and then searches for a tree that represents as many of such topologies as is possible .",
    "if the theory and data were perfect then there was a tree that represented precisely all most likely quartet topologies .",
    "unfortunately , in real life the theory is not perfect , the data are corrupted , and the observation polutes and makes errors .",
    "thus , one has to settle for embedding as many most likely quartet topologies as possible , do error correction on the quartet topologies , and so on . for @xmath1 objects ,",
    "there are @xmath2 unrooted bifurcating trees .",
    "for @xmath1 large , exhaustive search for the optimal tree is impossible , and turns out to be np - hard , and hence infeasible in general .",
    "there are two main avenues that have been taken :    \\(i ) incrementally grow the tree in random order by stepwise addition of objects in the current optimal way , repeat this for different object orders , and add agreement values on the branches , like dnaml @xcite , or quartet puzzling @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) approximate the global optimum monotonically or compute it , using geometric algorithm or dynamic programming @xcite , and linear programming @xcite .",
    "these methods , other methods , as well as methods related to the mqt problem , can not handle more than 1530 objects @xcite directly , even while using farms of desktops . to handle more objects one needs to construct a supertree from the constituent quartet trees for subsets of the original data sets , @xcite , as in @xcite .    in 2003 in @xcite we considered a new approach , like @xcite , and possibly predating it .",
    "our goal was to use a quartet method to obtain high - quality hierarchical clustering of data from arbitrary ( possibly heterogenous ) domains , not necessarily phylogeny data .",
    "we thus do not assume that there exists a true evolutionary tree , and our aim is not to just embed as many optimal quartet topologies as is possible .",
    "instead , for @xmath1 objects we consider all @xmath0 possible quartet topologies , each with a given weight , and our goal is to find the tree such that the summed weights of the embedded quartet topologies is optimal .",
    "we develop an heuristic that monotonically approximates this optimum , a figure of merit that quantifies the quality of the best current candidate tree .",
    "we show that the problem is np - hard , but we give evidence that the natural data sets we consider have qualities of smoothness so that the monotonic heuristic obtains the global optimum in a feasible number of steps .",
    "* materials and methods : * some of the experiments reported are taken from @xcite where many more can be found .",
    "the data samples we used were obtained from standard data bases accessible on the world - wide web , generated by ourselves , or obtained from research groups in the field of investigation .",
    "we supply the details with each experiment .",
    "the clustering heuristic generates a tree with an optimality quantification , called standardized benefit score or @xmath3 value in the sequel .",
    "contrary to other phylogeny methods , we do not have agreement or confidence values on the branches : we generate the best tree possible , globally balancing all requirements . generating trees from the same distance matrix many times resulted in the same tree in case of high @xmath3 value , or a similar tree in case of moderately high @xmath3 value , for all distance matrices we used , even though the heuristic is randomized .",
    "that is , there is only one way to be right , but increasingly many ways to be increasingly wrong which can all be realized by different runs of the randomized algorithm .",
    "the quality of the results depends on how well the hierarchical tree represents the information in the matrix . that quality is measured by the @xmath3 value , and is given with each experiment . in certain natural data sets , such as h5n1 genomic sequences ,",
    "consistently high @xmath3 values are returned even for large sets of objects of 100 or more nodes . in other discordant natural data sets",
    "however , the @xmath3 value deteriorates more and more with increasing number of elements being put in the same tree .",
    "the reason is that with increasing size of a discordant natural data set the projection of the information in the distance matrix into a ternary tree gets necessarily increasingly distorted because the underlying structure in the data is incommensurate with any tree shape whatsoever . in this way",
    ", larger structures may induce additional `` stress '' in the mapping that is visible as lower and lower @xmath3 scores .",
    "* figures : * we use two styles to display the hierarchical clusters . in the case of genomics of eutherian orders , it is convenient to follow the dendrograms that are customary in that area ( suggesting temporal evolution ) for easy comparison with the literature . in the other experiments ( even the genomic sars experiment )",
    "it is more informative to display an unrooted ternary tree ( or binary tree if we think about incoming and outgoing edges ) with explicit internal nodes .",
    "this facilitates identification of clusters in terms of subtrees rooted at internal nodes or contiguous sets of subtrees rooted at branches of internal nodes .",
    "given a set of objects as points in a space provided with a ( not necessarily metric ) distance measure , the associated _ distance matrix _ has as entries the pairwise distances between the objects .",
    "regardless of the original space and distance measure , it is always possible to configure @xmath1 objects in @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space in such a way that the associated distances are identical to the original ones , resulting in an identical distance matrix .",
    "this distance matrix contains the pairwise distance relations according to the chosen measure in raw form .",
    "but in this format that information is not easily usable , since for @xmath4 our cognitive capabilities rapidly fail . just as the distance matrix is a reduced form of information representing the original data set , we now need to reduce the information even further in order to achieve a cognitively acceptable format like data clusters . to extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix , we determine a dendrogram ( ternary tree ) that agrees with the distance matrix according to a cost measure .",
    "this allows us to extract more information from the data than just flat clustering ( determining disjoint clusters in dimensional representation ) .",
    "clusters are groups of objects that are similar according to our metric .",
    "there are various ways to cluster .",
    "our aim is to analyze data sets for which the number of clusters is not known a priori , and the data are not labeled . as stated in @xcite , conceptually simple , hierarchical clustering is among the best known unsupervised methods in this setting , and the most natural way is to represent the relations in the form of a dendrogram , which is customarily a directed binary tree or undirected ternary tree . with increasing number of data items",
    ", the projection of the distance matrix information into the tree representation format may get distorted .",
    "not all natural data sets exhibit this phenomenon ; but for some , the tree gets increasingly distorted as more objects are added .",
    "a similar situation sometimes arises in using alignment cost in genomic comparisons .",
    "experience shows that in both cases the hierarchical clustering methods seem to work best for small sets of data , up to 25 items , and to deteriorate for some ( but not all ) larger sets , say 40 items or more .",
    "this deterioration is directly observable in the @xmath3 score and degrades solutions in two common forms : tree instability when different or very different solutions are returned on successive runs or tree `` overlinearization '' when some data sets produce caterpillar - like structures only or predominantly . in case",
    "a large set of objects , say 100 objects , clusters with high @xmath3 value this is evidence that the data are of themselves tree - like , and the quartet - topology weights , or underlying distances , truely represent to similarity relationships between the data .",
    "given a set @xmath5 of @xmath1 objects , we consider every set of four elements from our set of @xmath1 elements ; there are @xmath6 such sets . from each set",
    "@xmath7 we construct a tree of arity 3 , which implies that the tree consists of two subtrees of two leaves each .",
    "let us call such a tree a _ quartet topology_. the set of @xmath8 quartet topologies induced by @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "we denote a partition @xmath10 of @xmath7 by @xmath11 .",
    "there are three possibilities to partition @xmath7 into two subsets of two elements each : ( i ) @xmath11 , ( ii ) @xmath12 , and ( iii ) @xmath13 . in terms of the tree topologies :",
    "a vertical bar divides the two pairs of leaf nodes into two disjoint subtrees ( figure  [ figquart ] ) .    for the moment we consider the class @xmath14 of undirected trees of arity 3 with @xmath15 leaves , labeled with the elements of @xmath5 .",
    "such trees have @xmath1 leaves and @xmath16 internal nodes . for any given tree @xmath17 from this class , and",
    "any set of four leaf labels @xmath18 , we say @xmath17 is @xmath19 with @xmath11 if and only if the path from @xmath20 to @xmath21 does not cross the path from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to see that precisely one of the three possible quartet topologies for any set of 4 labels is consistent for a given tree from the above class , and therefore a tree from @xmath14 contains precisely @xmath6 different quartet topolgies .",
    "we may think of a large tree having many smaller quartet topologies embedded within its structure .",
    "commonly the goal in the quartet method is to find ( or approximate as closely as possible ) the tree that embeds the maximal number of consistent ( possibly weighted ) quartet topologies from a given set @xmath24 of quartet topologies",
    "@xcite ( figure  [ figexquart ] ) .",
    "a _ weight function _",
    "@xmath25 , with @xmath26 the set of real numbers determines the weights .",
    "the unweighted case is when @xmath27 for all @xmath28 .",
    "the ( weighted ) _ maximum quartet consistency ( mqc ) _ is defined as follows :    given : @xmath5 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "question : find @xmath31 and @xmath32 is consistent with @xmath33 .",
    "the rationale for the mqc optimization problem is the assumption that there is exists a tree @xmath34 as desired in the class @xmath14 under consideration , and our only problem is to find it .",
    "this assumption reflects the genesis of the method in the phylogeny community . under the assumption that",
    "biological species developed by evolution in time , and @xmath5 is a subset of the now existing species , there is a phylogeny @xmath29 ( tree in @xmath14 ) that represents that evolution .",
    "the set of quartet topologies consistent with this tree , has one quartet topology per quartet which is the true one .",
    "the quartet topologies in @xmath29 are the ones which we assume to be among the true quartet topologies , and weights are used to express our relative certainty about this assumption concerning the individual quartet topologies in @xmath29 .",
    "however , the data may be corrupted so that this assumption is no longer true . in the general case of hierarchical clustering",
    "we do not even have a priori knowledge that certain quartet topologies are objectively true and must be embedded .",
    "rather , we are in the position that we can somehow assign a relative importance to the different quartet topologies .",
    "our task is then to balance the importance of embedding different quartet topologies against one another , leading to a tree that represents the concerns as well as possible .",
    "we start from a cost - assignment to the quartet topologies ; the method by which we assign costs to the @xmath0 quartet topologies is for now immaterial to our problem . given a set @xmath5 of @xmath1 objects ,",
    "let @xmath9 be the set of quartet topologies , and let @xmath35 be a _ cost function _ assigning a real valued cost @xmath36 to each quartet @xmath37 .",
    "the _ cost _ @xmath38 of a tree @xmath17 with a set @xmath5 of leaves ( external nodes of degree 1 ) is defined by @xmath39 is consistent with @xmath40the sum of the costs of all its consistent quartet topologies .    given @xmath5 and @xmath41 , the _ minimum quartet tree cost ( mqtc ) _ is @xmath42 @xmath17 is a tree with the set @xmath5 labeling its leaves@xmath43 .",
    "we normalize the problem of finding the mqtc as follows : consider the list of all possible quartet topologies for all four - tuples of labels under consideration . for each group of three possible quartet topologies for a given set of four labels @xmath44 ,",
    "calculate a best ( minimal ) cost @xmath45 , and a worst ( maximal ) cost @xmath46 . summing all best quartet toplogies",
    "yields the best ( minimal ) cost @xmath47 .",
    "conversely , summing all worst quartet toplogies yields the worst ( maximal ) cost @xmath48 .",
    "for some distance matrices , these minimal and maximal values can not be attained by actual trees ; however , the score @xmath38 of every tree @xmath17 will lie between these two values . in order to be able to compare the scores of quartet trees for different numbers of objects in a uniform way , we now rescale the score linearly such that the worst score maps to 0 , and the best score maps to 1 :    the _ normalized tree benefit score _",
    "@xmath3 is defined by @xmath49 .",
    "our goal is to find a full tree with a maximum value of @xmath3 , which is to say , the lowest total cost .",
    "now we can rephrase the mqtc problem in such a way that solutions of instances of different sizes can be uniformly compared in terms of relative quality :    definition of the _ mqtc problem _ :    given : @xmath5 and @xmath41 .",
    "question : find a tree @xmath34 with @xmath50 @xmath17 is a tree with the set @xmath5 labeling its leaves@xmath43 .",
    "the hardness of quartet puzzling is informally mentioned in the literature @xcite , but we provide explicit proofs . to express the notion of computational difficulty one uses the notion of `` nondeterministic polynomial time ( np ) '' .",
    "if a problem concerning @xmath1 objects is np - hard this means that the best known algorithm for this ( and a wide class of significant problems ) requires computation time exponential in @xmath1 .",
    "that is , it is infeasible in practice .",
    "the _ mqc decision problem _ is the following : given a set @xmath5 of @xmath1 objects , let @xmath17 be a tree of which the @xmath1 leaves are labeled by the objects , and let @xmath9 be the set of quartet topologies and @xmath51 be the set of quartet topologies embedded in @xmath17 . given a set of quartet topologies @xmath24 , and an integer @xmath52 , the problem is to decide whether there is a binary tree @xmath17 such that @xmath53 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the mqc decision problem is np - hard .",
    "we have formulated the np - hardness of the so - called _ incomplete _ mqc decision problem , the less general _ complete mqc decision problem _ requires @xmath29 to contain precisely one quartet topology per quartet out of @xmath5 , and is proven to be np - hard as well in @xcite .",
    "the mqtc decision problem is np - hard .    by reduction from the mqc decision problem .",
    "for every mqc decision problem one can define a corresponding mqtc decision problem that has the same solution : give the quartet topologies in @xmath29 cost 0 and the ones in @xmath54 cost 1 .",
    "consider the mqtc decision problem : is there a tree @xmath17 with the set @xmath5 labeling its leaves such that @xmath55 ? an alternative equivalent formulation is : is there a tree @xmath17 with the set @xmath5 labeling its leaves such that @xmath56 note that every tree @xmath17 with the set @xmath5 labeling its leaves has precisely one out of the three quartet topologies of every of the @xmath6 quartets embedded in it .",
    "therefore , the cost @xmath57 .",
    "if the answer to the above question is affirmative , then the number of quartet topologies in @xmath29 that are embedded in the tree exceeds @xmath52 ; if it is not then there is no tree such that the number of quartet topologies in @xmath29 embedded in it exceeds @xmath52 . this way the mqc decision problem can be reduced to the mqtc decision problem , which shows also the latter to be np - hard .",
    "is it possible that the best @xmath3 value is always one , that is , there always exists a tree that embeds all quartets at minimum cost quartet topologies ? consider the case @xmath58 .",
    "since there is only one quartet , we can set @xmath34 equal to the minimum cost quartet topology , and have @xmath59 . a priori we can not exclude the possibility that for every @xmath5 and @xmath41 there always is a tree @xmath34 with @xmath59 . in that case",
    ", the mqtc problem reduces to finding that @xmath34 .",
    "however , the situation turns out to be more complex .",
    "note first that the set of quartet topologies uniquely determines a tree in @xmath14 , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath60 be different labeled trees in @xmath14 and let @xmath61 be the sets of embedded quartet topologies , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath62 .",
    "a _ complete set _ of quartet topologies on @xmath5 is a set containing precisely one quartet topology per quartet .",
    "there are @xmath63 such combinations , but only @xmath64 labeled undirected graphs on @xmath1 nodes ( and therefore @xmath65 ) .",
    "hence , not every complete set of quartet topologies corresponds to a tree in @xmath14 .",
    "this already suggests that we can weight the quartet topologies in such a way that the full combination of all quartet topologies at minimal costs does not correspond to a tree in @xmath14 , and hence @xmath66 for @xmath67 realizing the mqtc optimum . for an explicit example of this",
    ", we use that a complete set corresponding to a tree in @xmath14 must satisfy certain transitivity properties , @xcite :    [ cl1 ] let @xmath17 be a tree in the considered class with leaves @xmath5 , @xmath9 the set of quartet topologies and @xmath68",
    ". then @xmath69 uniquely determines @xmath17 if    \\(i ) @xmath69 contains precisely one quartet topology for every quartet , and    \\(ii ) for all @xmath70 , if @xmath71 then @xmath72 , as well as if @xmath73 then @xmath74 .",
    "there are @xmath5 ( with @xmath75 ) and a cost function @xmath41 such that , for every @xmath76 , @xmath3 does not exceed @xmath77 .",
    "consider @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 for all remaining quartet topologies @xmath82 .",
    "we see that @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the tree @xmath85 has cost @xmath86 , since it embeds quartet topologies @xmath87 .",
    "we show that @xmath34 achieves the mqtc optimum . _ case 1 : _ if a tree @xmath88 embeds @xmath32 , then it must by item ( i ) of lemma  [ cl1 ] also embed a quartet topology containing @xmath89 that has cost 1 .    _",
    "case 2 : _ if a tree @xmath88 embeds @xmath90 and @xmath91 , then it must by item ( ii ) of the lemma  [ cl1 ] also embed @xmath92 , and hence have cost @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , all other remaining cases of embedding a combination of a quartet topology not containing @xmath89 of 0 cost with a quartet topology containing @xmath89 of 0 cost in @xmath17 , imply an embedded quartet topology of cost 1 in @xmath17 .",
    "altogether , the mqtc optimization problem is infeasible in practice , and natural data can have an optimal @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , it follows from the above analysis that to determine @xmath3 in general is np - hard . in @xcite a polynomial time approximation scheme for complete mqc",
    "is exhibited , a theoretical approximation scheme allowing the approximation of the optimal solution up to arbitrary precision , with running time polynomial in the inverse of that precision .",
    "we say `` theoretical '' since that algorithm would run in something like @xmath95 . for incomplete mqc it is shown that even such a theoretical algorithm does not exist , unless p = np .",
    "hence , computation of the mqtc optimum , and even its approximation with given precision , requires superpolynomial time unless p = np .",
    "therefore , any practical approach to obtain or approximate the mqtc optimum requires heuristics .",
    "our algorithm is essentially randomized hill - climbing , using parallellized genetic programming , where undirected trees evolve in a random walk driven by a prescribed fitness function .",
    "we are given a set @xmath5 of @xmath1 objects and a weighting function @xmath30 .",
    "we define a _ simple mutation _ on a labeled undirected ternary tree as one of three possible transformations :    1 .   a _ leaf swap _ , which consists of randomly choosing two leaf nodes and swapping them .",
    "2 .   a _ subtree swap _ , which consists of randomly choosing two internal nodes and swapping the subtrees rooted at those nodes .",
    "a _ subtree transfer _ , whereby a randomly chosen subtree ( possibly a leaf ) is detached and reattached in another place , maintaining arity invariants .",
    "each of these simple mutations keeps the number of leaf nodes and internal nodes in the tree invariant ; only the structure and placements change .",
    "@xmath52-mutation _ is a sequence of @xmath52 simple mutations .",

    "the probability distribution @xmath101 is easily generated by running a random fair bit generator and set @xmath52 to the length of the first self - delimiting sequence generated .",
    "that is , if @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) , then @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the length @xmath107 .",
    "the probability of generating @xmath108 corresponding to a given @xmath23 of length @xmath52 by fair coin flips is @xmath109 .",
    "the probability of generating @xmath108 corresponding to _ some _ @xmath23 of length @xmath52 is @xmath110 times as large , that is , @xmath111 . in practice",
    ", we used a `` shifted '' fat tail distribution @xmath112    * step 5 : * compose a @xmath52-mutation by , for each such simple mutation , choosing one of the three types listed above with equal probability . for each of these simple mutations , we uniformly at random select leaves or internal nodes , as appropriate .",
    "_ comment : _ notice that trees which are close to the original tree ( in terms of number of simple mutation steps in between ) are examined often , while trees that are far away from the original tree will eventually be examined , but not very frequently .",
    "* step 6 : * in order to search for a better tree , we simply apply the @xmath52-mutation constructed in * step 5 * on @xmath34 to obtain @xmath113 , and then calculate @xmath114 .",
    "if @xmath115 , then replace the current candidate in @xmath34 by @xmath17 ( as the new best tree ) : @xmath98 .",
    "* step 7 : * if @xmath116 or a * termination condition * to be discussed below holds , then output the tree in @xmath34 as the best tree and halt .",
    "otherwise , go to * step 4*.    we have chosen @xmath101 to be a `` fat - tail '' distribution , with the fattest tail possible , to concentrate maximal probability also on the larger values of @xmath52 .",
    "that way , the likelihood of getting trapped in local minima is minimized .",
    "in contrast , if one would choose an exponential scheme , like @xmath117 , then the larger values of @xmath52 would arise so scarcely that practically speaking the distinction between being absolutely trapped in a local optimum , and the very low escape probability , would be insignificant . considering positive - valued probability mass functions @xmath118 $ ] , with @xmath119 the natural numbers , as we do here , we note that such a function ( i ) @xmath120 , and ( ii ) @xmath121 .",
    "thus , every function of the natural numbers that has stricly positive values and converges can be normalized to such a probability mass function . for smooth analytic functions that can be expressed a series of fractional powers and logarithms , the borderline between converging and diverging is as follows : @xmath122 , @xmath123 and so on diverge , while @xmath124,@xmath125 and so on converge .",
    "therefore , the maximal fat tail of a `` smooth '' function @xmath126 with @xmath127 arises for functions at the edge of the convergence family .",
    "the distribution @xmath128 is as close to the edge as is reasonable , and because the used coding @xmath129 is a prefix code we have @xmath130 by the kraft inequality ( see for ecample @xcite ) and therefore @xmath131 .",
    "let us see what this means for our algorithm using the choosen distribution @xmath101 .",
    "for @xmath132 , say , we can change any tree in @xmath14 to any other tree in @xmath14 with a 64-mutation .",
    "the probability of such a complex mutation occurring is quite large with such a fat tail : @xmath133 , that is , more than 40 times in 100,000 generations .",
    "if we can get out of a local minimum with already a 32-mutation , then this occurs with probability at least @xmath134 , so 125 times , and with a 16-mutation with probability at least @xmath135 , so 510 times .",
    "the main problem with hill - climbing algorithms is that they can get stuck in a local optimum .",
    "however , by randomly selecting a sequence of simple mutations , longer sequences with decreasing probability , we essentially run a metropolis monte carlo algorithm @xcite , reminiscent of simulated annealing @xcite at random temperatures .",
    "since there is a nonzero probability for every tree in @xmath14 being transformed into every other tree in @xmath14 , there is zero probability that we get trapped forever in a local optimum that is not a global optimum .",
    "that is , trivially :    \\(i ) the algorithm approximates the mqtc optimal solution monotonically in each run .",
    "\\(ii ) the algorithm without termination condition solves the mqtc optimization problem eventually with probability 1 ( but we do not in general know when the optimum has been reached in a particular run ) .",
    "the main question therefore is the convergence speed of the algorithm on natural data , and a termination criterion to terminate the algorithm when we have an acceptable approximation . from the impossibility result in @xcite",
    "we know that there is no polynomial approximation scheme for mqtc optimization , and whether our scheme is expected polynomial time seems to require proving that the involved metropolis chain is rapidly mixing @xcite , a notoriously hard and generally unsolved problem . in practice ,",
    "in our experiments there is unanymous evidence that for the natural data and the weighting function we have used , convergence is always fast .",
    "we have to determine the cost of @xmath6 quartets to determine each @xmath3 value .",
    "hence the algorithm runs in time at least that much . in experiments we found that for the same data set different runs consistently showed the same behavior , for example figure  [ figprogress ] for a 60-object computation .",
    "there the @xmath3 value leveled off at about 70,000 examined trees , and the termination condition was `` no improvement in 5,000 trees . '' different random runs of the algorithm nearly always gave the same behavior , returning a tree with the same @xmath3 value , albeit a different tree in most cases with here @xmath136 , a relatively low value .",
    "that is , since there are many ways to find a tree of optimal @xmath3 value , and apparently the algorithm never got trapped in a lower local optimum . for problems with high @xmath3 value , as we see later , the algorithm consistently returned the same tree .",
    "this situation is perhaps similar to the behavior of the simplex method in linear programming , that can be shown to run in exponential time on a badly choosen problem instance , but in practice on natural problems consistently runs in linear time .",
    "note that if a tree is ever found such that @xmath137 , then we can stop because we can be certain that this tree is optimal , as no tree could have a lower cost .",
    "in fact , this perfect tree result is achieved in our artificial tree reconstruction experiment ( section  [ sect.artificial ] ) reliably in a few minutes . for real - world data",
    ", @xmath3 reaches a maximum somewhat less than @xmath138 , presumably reflecting distortion of the information in the distance matrix data by the best possible tree representation , as noted above , or indicating getting stuck in a local optimum or a search space too large to find the global optimum . on many typical problems of up to 40 objects",
    "this tree - search gives a tree with @xmath139 within half an hour .",
    "for large numbers of objects , tree scoring itself can be slow : as this takes order @xmath140 computation steps .",
    "current single computers can score a tree of this size in about a minute .",
    "additionally , the space of trees is large , so the algorithm may slow down substantially . for larger experiments",
    ", we used the c program called partree ( part of the complearn package @xcite ) with mpi ( message passing interface , a common standard used on massively parallel computers ) on a cluster of workstations in parallel to find trees more rapidly .",
    "we can consider the graph mapping the achieved @xmath3 score as a function of the number of trees examined .",
    "progress occurs typically in a sigmoidal fashion towards a maximal value @xmath141 , figure  [ figprogress ] .",
    "the _ termination condition _ is of two types and which type is used determines the number of objects we can handle .",
    "_ simple termination condition : _ we simply run the algorithm until it seems no better trees are being found in a reasonable amount of time . here",
    "we typically terminate if no improvement in @xmath3 value is achieved within 100,000 examined trees .",
    "this criterion is simple enough to enable us to hierarchically cluster data sets up to 80 objects in a few hours .",
    "this is way above the 1530 objects in the previous exact ( non - incremental ) methods ( see introduction ) .",
    "_ agreement termination condition : _ in this more sophisticated method we select a number @xmath142 of runs , and we run @xmath143 invocations of the algorithm in parallel . each time an @xmath3 value in run @xmath144 is increased in this process it is compared with the @xmath3 values in all the other runs . if they are all equal , then the candidate trees of the runs are compared .",
    "this can be done by simply comparing the ordered lists of embedded quartet topologies , in some standard order , since the set of embedded quartet topologies uniquely determines the quartet tree by @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath143 candidate trees are identical , then terminate with this quartet tree as output , otherwise continue the algorithm .",
    "this termination condition takes ( for the same number of steps per run ) about @xmath143 times as long as the simple termination condition .",
    "but the termination condition is much more rigorous , provided we choose @xmath143 appropriate to the number @xmath1 of objects being clustered .",
    "since all the runs are randomized independently at startup , it seems very unlikely that with natural data all of them get stuck in the same local optimum with the same quartet tree instance , provided the number @xmath1 of objects being clustered is not too small . for @xmath145 and",
    "the number of invocations @xmath146 , there is a reasonable probability that the two different runs by chance hit the same tree in the same step .",
    "this phenomenon leads us to require more than two successive runs with exact agreement before we may reach a final answer for small @xmath1 .",
    "in the case of @xmath147 , we require 6 dovetailed runs to agree precisely before termination . for @xmath148 , @xmath149 . for @xmath150 , @xmath151 . for @xmath152 , @xmath153 . for all other @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "this yields a reasonable tradeoff between speed and accuracy .",
    "it is clear that there is only one tree with @xmath156 ( if that is possible for the data ) , and random trees ( the majority of all possible quartet trees ) have @xmath157 ( above ) .",
    "this gives evidence that the number of quartet trees with large @xmath3 values is much smaller than the number of trees with small @xmath3 values .",
    "it is furthermore evident that the precise relation depends on the data set involved , and hence can not be expressed by a general formula without further assumptions on the data .",
    "however , we can safely state that small data sets , of say @xmath158 objects , that in our experience often lead to @xmath3 values close to 1 have very few quartet trees realizing the optimal @xmath3 value . on the other hand , those large sets of 60 or more objects that contain some inconsistency and",
    "thus lead to a low final @xmath3 value also tend to exhibit more variation as one might expect .",
    "this suggests that in the agreement termination method each run will get stuck in a different quartet tree of a similar @xmath3 value , so termination with the same tree is not possible .",
    "experiments show that with the rigorous agreement termination we can handle sets of up to 40 objects , and with the simple termination up to at least 80 objects on a single computer or 100 - 200 objects using a cluster of computers in parallel .",
    "we used the complearn package , @xcite , to analyze a `` 10-mammals '' example with _",
    "compression yielding a @xmath159 distance matrix , similar to the examples in section  [ sect.nat ] .",
    "the algorithm starts with four randomly initialized trees .",
    "it tries to improve each one randomly and finishes when they match .",
    "thus , every run produces an output tree , a maximum score associated with this tree , and has examined some total number of trees , @xmath17 , before it finished .",
    "figure  [ fig.plot ] shows a graph displaying a histogram of @xmath17 over one thousand runs of the distance matrix .",
    "the @xmath23-axis represents a number of trees examined in a single run of the program , measured in thousands of trees and binned in 1000-wide histogram bars .",
    "the maximum number is about 12000 trees examined .",
    "the graph suggests a poisson distribution . about @xmath160rd of the trials",
    "take less than 4000 trees . in the thousand trials",
    "above , 994 ended with the optimal @xmath161 .",
    "the remaining six runs returned 5 cases of the second - highest score , @xmath162 and one case of @xmath163 .",
    "it is important to realize that outcome stability is dependent on input matrix particulars .",
    "another interesting distribution is the mutation stepsize .",
    "recall that the mutation length is drawn from a shifted fat - tail distribution .",
    "but if we restrict our attention to just the mutations that improve the @xmath3 value , then we may examine these statistics to look for evidence of a modification to this distribution due to , for example , the presence of very many isolated areas that have only long - distance ways to escape .",
    "figure  [ fig.mutplot ] shows the histogram    of successful mutation lengths ( that is , number of simple mutations composing a single `` kept '' complex mutation ) and rejected lengths ( both normalized ) which shows that this is not the case . here",
    "the @xmath23-axis is the number of mutation steps and the @xmath89-axis is the normalized proportion of times that step size occured .",
    "this gives good empirical evidence that in this case , at least , we have a relatively easy search space , without large gaps .      with natural data sets ,",
    "say music data , one may have the preconception ( or prejudice ) that music by bach should be clustered together , music by chopin should be clustered together , and so should music by rock stars",
    ". however , the preprocessed music files of a piece by bach and a piece by chopin , or the beatles , may resemble one another more than two different pieces by bach  by accident or indeed by design and copying .",
    "thus , natural data sets may have ambiguous , conflicting , or counterintuitive outcomes . in other words , the experiments on natural data sets have the drawback of not having an objective clear `` correct '' answer that can function as a benchmark for assessing our experimental outcomes , but only intuitive or traditional preconceptions",
    "we discuss three experiments that show that our program indeed does what it is supposed to do  at least in artificial situations where we know in advance what the correct answer is .",
    "given a distance matrix , with entries giving the pairwise distances between the objects , we want to hierarchically cluster them by representing the objects as leaves of a ternary tree representing the distances in the matrix as faithfully as possible .",
    "it is important that we do not assume that there is a true tree ; rather , we want to model the data as well as possible .",
    "the cost of a quartet topology is defined as the sum of the distances between each pair of neighbors ; that is , @xmath164 .",
    "this seems most natural given a distance matrix .",
    "recall that the problem of clustering data consists of two parts : ( i ) extracting a distance matrix from the data , and ( ii ) constructing a tree from the distance matrix using our novel quartet - based heuristic . to check the new quartet tree method in action we use a new compression - based distance , called ncd .",
    "this metric distance was co - developed by us in @xcite , as a normalized version of the `` information metric '' of @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , two objects are deemed close if we can significantly `` compress '' one given the information in the other , the idea being that if two pieces are more similar , then we can more succinctly describe one given the other .",
    "the mathematics used is based on kolmogorov complexity theory @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we defined a new class of ( possibly non - metric ) distances , taking values in @xmath165 $ ] and appropriate for measuring effective similarity relations between sequences , say one type of similarity per distance , and _ vice versa_. it was shown that an appropriately `` normalized '' information metric minorizes every distance in the class .",
    "it discovers all effective similarities in the sense that if two objects are close according to some effective similarity , then they are also close according to the normalized information distance .",
    "put differently , the normalized information distance represents similarity according to the dominating shared feature between the two objects being compared . in comparisons of more than two objects , different pairs may have different dominating features .",
    "the normalized information distance is a metric and takes values in @xmath165 $ ] ; hence it may be called _",
    "`` the '' similarity metric_. to apply this ideal precise mathematical theory in real life , we have to replace the use of the noncomputable kolmogorov complexity by an approximation using a standard real - world compressor , resulting in the ncd , see @xcite .",
    "this has been used in the first completely automatic construction of the phylogeny tree based on whole mitochondrial genomes , @xcite , a completely automatic construction of a language tree for over 50 euro - asian languages @xcite , detects plagiarism in student programming assignments @xcite , gives phylogeny of chain letters @xcite , and clusters music @xcite , analyzing network traffic and worms using compression @xcite , and many more topics @xcite .",
    "the method turns out to be robust under change of the underlying compressor - types : statistical ( ppmz ) , lempel - ziv based dictionary ( gzip ) , block based ( bzip2 ) , or special purpose ( gencompress ) .",
    "oblivious to the problem area concerned , simply using the distances according to the ncd above , the method described in this paper fully automatically classifies the objects concerned .",
    "the method has been released in the public domain as open - source software : the complearn toolkit @xcite is a suite of simple utilities that one can use to apply compression techniques to the process of discovering and learning patterns in completely different domains , and hierarchically cluster them using the new quartet method described in this paper .",
    "in fact , this method is so general that it requires no background knowledge about any particular subject area .",
    "there are no domain - specific parameters to set , and only a handful of general settings .",
    "we first test whether the quartet - based tree construction heuristic is trustworthy : we generated a ternary tree @xmath17 with 18 leaves , using the pseudo - random number generator `` rand '' of the ruby programming language , and derived a metric from it by defining the distance between two nodes as follows : given the length of the path from @xmath166 to @xmath167 , in an integer number of edges , as @xmath168 , let @xmath169 except when @xmath170 , in which case @xmath171 .",
    "it is easy to verify that this simple formula always gives a number between 0 and 1 , and is monotonic with path length .",
    "given only the @xmath172 matrix of these normalized distances , our quartet method exactly reconstructed the original tree @xmath17 represented in figure  [ figarttreereal ] , with @xmath156 .",
    "given that the tree reconstruction method is accurate on clean consistent data , we tried whether the full procedure works in an acceptable manner when we know what the outcome should be like .",
    "we used the `` rand '' pseudo - random number generator from the c programming language standard library under linux .",
    "we randomly generated 11 separate 1-kilobyte blocks of data where each byte was equally probable and called these _",
    "tags_. each tag was associated with a different lowercase letter of the alphabet .",
    "next , we generated 22 files of 80 kilobyte each , by starting with a block of purely random bytes and applying one , two , three , or four different tags on it . applying a tag consists of ten repetitions of picking a random location in the 80-kilobyte file , and overwriting that location with the globally consistent tag that is indicated .",
    "so , for instance , to create the file referred to in the diagram by `` a , '' we start with 80 kilobytes of random data , then pick ten places to copy over this random data with the arbitrary 1-kilobyte sequence identified as tag _",
    "a_. similarly , to create file `` ab , '' we start with 80 kilobytes of random data , then pick ten places to put copies of tag _ a _ , then pick ten more places to put copies of tag _ b _ ( perhaps overwriting some of the _ a _ tags ) . because we never use more than four different tags , and therefore never place more than 40 copies of tags",
    ", we can expect that at least half of the data in each file is random and uncorrelated with the rest of the files .",
    "the rest of the file is correlated with other files that also contain tags in common ; the more tags in common , the more related the files are .",
    "the compressor used to compute the ncd matrix was bzip2 .",
    "the resulting tree is given in figure  [ figtaggedfiles ] ; it can be seen that the clustering has occured exactly as we would expect .",
    "the @xmath3 score is 0.905 .",
    "we test gross classification of files based on heterogenous data of markedly different file types : ( i ) four mitochondrial gene sequences , from a black bear , polar bear , fox , and rat obtained from the genbank database on the world - wide web ; ( ii ) four excerpts from the novel _ the zeppelin s passenger _ by e.  phillips oppenheim , obtained from the project gutenberg edition on the world - wide web ; ( iii ) four midi files without further processing ; two from jimi hendrix and two movements from debussy s suite bergamasque , downloaded from various repositories on the world - wide web ; ( iv ) two linux x86 elf executables ( the _ cp _ and _ rm _ commands ) , copied directly from the redhat 9.0 linux distribution ; and ( v ) two compiled java class files , generated by ourselves .",
    "the compressor used to compute the ncd matrix was bzip2 . as expected",
    ", the program correctly classifies each of the different types of files together with like near like .",
    "the result is reported in figure  [ figfiletypes ] with @xmath3 equal to the very high confidence value 0.984 .",
    "this experiment shows the power and universality of the method : no features of any specific domain of application are used .",
    "we believe that there is no other method known that can cluster data that is so heterogenous this reliably .",
    "this is borne out by the massive experiments with the method in @xcite .",
    "like most hierarchical clustering methods for natural data , the quartet tree method has been developed in the biological setting to determine phylogeny trees from genomic data . in that setting ,",
    "the data are ( parts of ) genomes of currently existing species , and the purpose is to reconstruct the evolutionary tree that led to those species .",
    "thus , the species are labels of the leaves , and the tree is traditionaly binary branching with each branching representing a split in lineages .",
    "the internal nodes and the root of the tree correspond with extinct species ( possibly a still existing species in a leaf directly connected to the internal node ) .",
    "the case is roughly similar for the language tree reconstruction mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the root of the tree is commonly determined by adding an object that is known to be less related to all other objects than the original objects are with respect to each other . where the unrelated object joins the tree is where we put the root . in these settings ,",
    "the direction from the root to the leaves represents an evolution in time , and the assumption is that there is a true tree we have to discover .",
    "however , we can also use the method for hierarchical clustering , resulting an unrooted ternary tree , and the assumption is not that there is a true tree we must discover .",
    "to the contrary , there is no true tree , but all we want is to model the similarity relations between the objects as well as possible , given the distance matrix .",
    "the interpretation is that objects in a given subtree are pairwise closer ( more similar ) to each other than any of those objects is with respect to any object in a disjoint subtree .      as an application of our methods we clustered the sars virus after its sequenced genome was made publicly available , in relation to potential similar virii .",
    "the 15 virus genomes were downloaded from the universal virus database of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , available on the world - wide web .",
    "the sars virus was downloaded from canada s michael smith genome sciences centre which had the first public sars coronovirus draft whole genome assembly available for download ( sars tor2 draft genome assembly 120403 ) .",
    "the ncd distance matrix was computed using the compressor bzip2 .",
    "the relations in figure  [ fig.sars ] are very similar to the definitive tree based on medical - macrobio - genomics analysis , appearing later in the new england journal of medicine , @xcite .",
    "we depicted the figure in the ternary tree style , rather than the genomics - dendrogram style , since the former is more precise for visual inspection of proximity relations .",
    "more recently , we downloaded 100 different h5n1 sample genomes from the ncbi / nih database online .",
    "we simply concatenated all data together directly , ignoring problems of data cleanup and duplication .",
    "we were warned in advance that certain coding regions in the viral genome were sometimes listed twice and also many sequences are incomplete or missing certain proteins . in this case",
    "we sought to test the robustness at the high end and at the same time verify , contextualize , and expand on the many claims of genetic similarity and diversity in the virology community .",
    "we used the complearn package , @xcite , with the _ ppmd _ compressor for this experiment and performed no alignment step whatsoever .",
    "we used order 15 with 250 megabytes memory maximum .",
    "we have abbreviated ck for chicken and dk for duck .",
    "samples are named with species , location , sequence number , followed by the year double digits at the end .",
    "naming is not 100% consistent .",
    "we can see the following features in figure  [ fig.big100 ] , that are possibly significant :    first , there is near - perfect temporal separation by branch and year , going all the way back to hongkong and guangdong in 1997 .",
    "next , there is near - perfect regional separation with clear dilineation of japan and the crucial qinghai , astrakhan , mongolia , and novosibirsk , as well as near - perfect separation of vietnam and thailand .",
    "the placement ckvietnamc5804 and vietnam306204 is interesting in that they are both near thailand branches and suggest that they may be for example the migratory bird links that have been hypothesized or some other genetic intermediate .",
    "there is also throughout the tree substantial agreement with ( and independent verification of ) independent experts like dr .",
    "henry l. niman  @xcite on every specific point regarding genetic similarity .",
    "the technique provides here an easy verification procedure without much work .",
    "the amount of digitized music available on the internet has grown dramatically in recent years , both in the public domain and on commercial sites .",
    "napster and its clones are prime examples .",
    "websites offering musical content in some form or other ( mp3 , midi ,  ) need a way to organize their wealth of material ; they need to somehow classify their files according to musical genres and subgenres , putting similar pieces together .",
    "the purpose of such organization is to enable users to navigate to pieces of music they already know and like , but also to give them advice and recommendations ( `` if you like this , you might also like  '' ) .",
    "currently , such organization is mostly done manually by humans , but some recent research has been looking into the possibilities of automating music classification . in @xcite",
    "we cluster music using the complearn toolkit @xcite .",
    "one example is a small set of classical piano sonatas , consisting of the 4 movements from debussy s `` suite bergamasque , '' 4 movements of book 2 of bach s `` wohltemperierte klavier , '' and 4 preludes from chopin s `` opus  28 . '' as one can see in figure  [ figsmallset ] , our program does a pretty good job at clustering these pieces .",
    "the @xmath3 score is also high : 0.968 .",
    "the 4 debussy movements form one cluster , as do the 4 bach pieces .",
    "the only imperfection in the tree , judged by what one would intuitively expect , is that chopin s prlude no .  15 lies a bit closer to bach than to the other 3 chopin pieces .",
    "this prlude no  15 , in fact , consistently forms an odd - one - out in our other experiments as well .",
    "this is an example of pure data mining , since there is some musical truth to this , as no .",
    "15 is perceived as by far the most eccentric among the 24 prludes of chopin s opus  28 .            in recent years , as the complete genomes of various species become available , it has become possible to do whole genome phylogeny ( this overcomes the problem that using different targeted parts of the genome , or proteins , may give different trees @xcite ) . traditional phylogenetic methods on individual genes depended on multiple alignment of the related proteins and on the model of evolution of individual amino acids .",
    "neither of these is practically applicable to the genome level . in absence of such models ,",
    "a method which can compute the shared information between two sequences is useful because biological sequences encode information , and the occurrence of evolutionary events ( such as insertions , deletions , point mutations , rearrangements , and inversions ) separating two sequences sharing a common ancestor will result in the loss of their shared information .",
    "our method ( in the form of the complearn toolkit ) is a fully automated software tool based on such a distance to compare two genomes . in evolutionary biology",
    "the timing and origin of the major extant placental clades ( groups of organisms that have evolved from a common ancestor ) continues to fuel debate and research . here",
    ", we provide evidence by whole mitochondrial genome phylogeny for competing hypotheses in two main questions : the grouping of the eutherian orders , and the therian hypothesis versus the marsupionta hypothesis .",
    "* eutherian orders : * we demonstrate ( already in @xcite ) that a whole mitochondrial genome phylogeny of the eutherians ( placental mammals ) can be reconstructed automatically from _ unaligned _ complete mitochondrial genomes by use of an early form of our compression method , using standard software packages .",
    "as more genomic material has become available , the debate in biology has intensified concerning which two of the three main groups of placental mammals are more closely related : primates , ferungulates , and rodents . in @xcite ,",
    "the maximum likelihood method of phylogeny tree reconstruction gave evidence for the ( ferungulates , ( primates , rodents ) ) grouping for half of the proteins in the mitochondial genomes investigated , and ( rodents , ( ferungulates , primates ) ) for the other halves of the mt genomes .",
    "in that experiment they aligned 12 concatenated mitochondrial proteins , taken from 20 species : rat ( _ rattus norvegicus _ ) , house mouse ( _ mus musculus _ ) , grey seal ( _ halichoerus grypus _ ) , harbor seal ( _ phoca vitulina _ ) , cat ( _ felis catus _ ) , white rhino ( _ ceratotherium simum _ ) , horse ( _ equus caballus _ ) , finback whale ( _ balaenoptera physalus _ ) , blue whale ( _ balaenoptera musculus _ ) , cow ( _ bos taurus _ ) , gibbon ( _ hylobates lar _ ) , gorilla ( _ gorilla gorilla _ ) , human ( _ homo sapiens _ ) , chimpanzee ( _ pan troglodytes _ ) , pygmy chimpanzee ( _ pan paniscus _ ) , orangutan ( _ pongo pygmaeus _ ) , sumatran orangutan ( _ pongo pygmaeus abelii _ ) , using opossum ( _ didelphis virginiana _ ) , wallaroo ( _ macropus robustus _ ) , and the platypus ( _ ornithorhynchus anatinus _ ) as outgroup .    * marsupionta and theria : * the extant monophyletic divisions of the class mammalia are the prototheria ( monotremes : mammals that procreate using eggs ) , metatheria ( marsupials : mammals that procreate using pouches ) , and eutheria ( placental mammals : mammals that procreate using placentas ) . the sister relationships between these groups is viewed as the most fundamental question in mammalian evolution @xcite .",
    "phylogenetic comparison by either anatomy or mitochondrial genome has resulted in two conflicting hypotheses : the gene - isolation - supported _ marsupionta hypothesis _ : ( ( prototheria , metatheria ) , eutheria ) versus the morphology - supported _ theria hypothesis _ : ( prototheria , ( methateria , eutheria ) ) , the third possiblity apparently not being held seriously by anyone .",
    "there has been a lot of support for either hypothesis ; recent support for the theria hypothesis was given in @xcite by analyzing a large nuclear gene ( m6p / ig2r ) , viewed as important across the species concerned , and even more recent support for the marsupionta hypothesis was given in @xcite by phylogenetic analysis of another sequence from the nuclear gene ( 18s rrna ) and by the whole mitochondrial genome .",
    "* experimental evidence : * to test the eutherian orders simultaneously with the marsupionta- versus theria hypothesis , we added four animals to the above twenty : australian echidna ( _ tachyglossus aculeatus _ ) , brown bear ( _ ursus arctos _ ) , polar bear ( _ ursus maritimus _ ) , using the common carp ( _ cyprinus carpio _ ) as the outgroup .",
    "interestingly , while there are many species of eutheria and metatheria , there are only three species of now living prototheria known : platypus , and two types of echidna ( or spiny anteater ) .",
    "so our sample of the prototheria is large .",
    "the whole mitochondrial genomes of the total of 24 species we used were downloaded from the genbank database on the world - wide web .",

    "the ncd distance matrix was computed using the compressor ppmz .",
    "the resulting phylogeny , with an almost maximal @xmath3 score of 0.996 supports anew the currently accepted grouping ( rodents , ( primates , ferungulates ) ) of the eutherian orders , and additionally the marsupionta hypothesis ( ( prototheria , metatheria ) , eutheria ) , see figure [ tree - mammal ] .",
    "overall , our whole - mitochondrial ncd analysis supports the following hypothesis :    which indicates that the rodents , and the branch leading to the metatheria and prototheria , split off early from the branch that led to the primates and ferungulates .",
    "inspection of the distance matrix shows that the primates are very close together , as are the rodents , the metatheria , and the prototheria .",
