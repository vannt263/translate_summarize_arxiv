    "coherent control of quantum tunneling in a double well via periodical driving has been researched extensively from both theoretical and experimental sides @xcite . some interesting phenomena , such as the coherent destruction or construction of tunneling ( cdt or cct ) @xcite , chaos enhancing tunneling @xcite , and photon - assisted tunneling @xcite have been found .",

    "subsequently , exploiting the coherent non - floquet solutions , we investigate time evolution of the particle population and demonstrate that beyond the crossing points , the bosons slowly vary their populations compared to the high - frequency driving .",

    "<S> we investigate interplay between external field and interatomic interaction and its applications to coherent control of quantum tunneling for two repulsive bosons confined in a high - frequency driven double well . </S>",
    "<S> a full solution of the system is generated analytically as a coherent non - floquet state by using the floquet states as a set of complete bases . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the photon resonance of interaction leads to translation of the floquet level - crossing points , and the non - resonant interaction causes avoided crossing of partial levels . in the non - floquet states , the bosons beyond </S>",
    "<S> the crossing points slowly vary their populations , and the resonant ( non - resonant ) interactions enhance ( decrease ) the tunneling rate of the paired particles . </S>",
    "<S> three different kinds of the coherent destructions of tunneling ( cdt ) at the crossing , avoided - crossing and uncrossing points , and the corresponding stationary - like states , are illustrated . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results are numerically confirmed and perfect agreements are found . based on the results , an useful scheme of quantum tunneling switch between stationary - like states is presented . </S>"
