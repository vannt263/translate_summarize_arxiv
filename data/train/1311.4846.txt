    "discovering radio pulsars in the galactic centre ( gc ) has been a long - sought goal , due to the promise it bears in probing the gravitational field of the massive black hole in the region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in deciphering the nature of the interstellar medium in its vicinity .",
    "despite several radio surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no pulsars were found .",
    "so far , the only pulsar in the inner parsec of the gc was found to be a @xmath0  3.76  s magnetar , which was discovered following an x - ray flaring episode in april 2013 @xcite , and a subsequent periodicity search @xcite .",
    "this was later confirmed in the radio as psr j1745@xmath12900 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite analysed the x - ray absorption of this source , and found that it is consistent with being at a similar distance as sgr a*. @xcite localised the magnetar to an angular distance of @xmath2 from sgr a*. at the gc distance of 8.25 kpc @xcite , this corresponds to a minimum distance of @xmath0 0.1 pc .",
    "interstellar scattering was thought to be a major problem in detecting pulsars in the gc , as models of electron density dictate a scattering timescale of at least @xmath3 s , but potentially up to 200 times larger @xcite , indicating that observations at higher frequencies are more favourable , with @xcite suggesting optimal frequencies in the 1016 ghz range for searches of non - millisecond pulsars .",
    "however , recent pulse broadening measurements @xcite and angular broadening measurements @xcite of the gc pulsar have demonstrated that scattering may not be as severe a limitation .    the gc magnetar has the largest dispersion measure ever measured for a pulsar , @xmath4 @xmath5 pc , and the largest rotation measure ever measured for any object other than sgr a * itself , @xmath6 rad m@xmath7 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the large faraday rotation can be explained by a large magnetic field associated with the plasma within 10  pc of the gc black hole , suggesting a highly complicated and magnetized interstellar medium in the gc region , well suited for scattering electromagnetic radiation .",
    "@xcite measure a pulse broadening timescale of @xmath8 s for j1745@xmath12900 at 1 ghz , which , albeit large , is much less than predicted values .",
    "the lack of detections of previous surveys implies either that previous surveys have not been sensitive enough , or that the gc tends to produce magnetars .",
    "given that observations of the gc have hitherto detected one magnetar and no normal pulsar , in this paper , we attempt to constrain the number of potentially observable pulsars ( including magnetars ) in the region using recent studies of the pulsar luminosity function and spectral indices .",
    "we employ two complementary methods  firstly , a bayesian parameter estimation approach , and secondly , a monte carlo ( mc ) approach to constrain the pulsar population in the gc .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec_bayes ] , we describe our bayesian technique and apply it to a few past surveys of the gc to obtain upper limits on the the number of gc pulsars . in  [ sec_mc ] , we describe our mc approach and use it to constrain the number of gc pulsars . in  [ sec_disc ]",
    ", we discuss our results and implications for future surveys .",
    "to quantify the likely size of the pulsar population in the gc region , we treat the gc as a population of pulsars at a common distance from the earth , @xmath9 , and consider a survey of this region at some frequency @xmath10 as having some finite probability of detecting a pulsar with flux density @xmath11 and a radio spectral index @xmath12 . here , as usual , we adopt a power - law relationship for the radio spectra ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so that @xmath13 . for a survey with some limiting sensitivity @xmath14 at frequency @xmath10 ,",
    "the corresponding limiting pulsar pseudo - luminosity scaled to 1.4 ghz @xmath15 this limiting luminosity can be used to compute the detection probability , i.e. , the probability of observing a pulsar above this limit , based on a choice of the pulsar luminosity function . @xcite",
    "have shown that the luminosity distribution of normal pulsars in the galactic field is log - normal in form .",
    "for the log - normal luminosity function , the detection probability @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mean and standard deviation of the log - normal .    using bayes theorem , we can utilize the above detection probability to estimate the number of pulsars in the gc .",
    "the joint posterior probability density for the number of non - recycled pulsars in the gc and the spectral index , given @xmath19 observed non - recycled pulsars , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the likelihood function , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the prior probability density functions of @xmath24 and @xmath12 , respectively . to account for the fact that we have observed one magnetar in the gc and zero normal pulsars ,",
    "the observed number of non - recycled pulsars is written as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the observed number of normal pulsars and @xmath27 is the observed number of magnetars .",
    "the aforementioned bayesian relation can then be rewritten , and the the likelihood function expanded , as @xmath28 here we make the reasonable assumption of statistical independence for @xmath29 and @xmath30 given @xmath24 and @xmath12 , as the formation scenarios for normal pulsars and magnetars are likely different .",
    "the parameter that we are trying to constrain , namely , the total number of non - recycled pulsars @xmath24 , can be written in terms of the magnetar fraction @xmath31  the ratio of magnetars to normal pulsars  as @xmath32 the value of @xmath31 is highly uncertain . in the galactic field ,",
    "25 magnetars are known , at least four of which emit in the radio , and of which only one was found in a radio survey @xcite .",
    "there are about 2000 non - recycled pulsars in the field @xcite , giving @xmath33 .",
    "considering only radio - emitting magnetars , @xmath31 becomes 0.002 , and considering only radio - loud magnetars detected in surveys , the magnetar fraction reduces to 0.0005 . due to the intermittency in the radio emission of magnetars , together with the selection effects that plague radio surveys ,",
    "the exact value of the magnetar fraction is unknown .",
    "so we decided to parametrize @xmath31 in our analysis , giving @xmath34    we compute the two likelihood functions using the binomial probability distribution , following @xcite . in the case of normal pulsars",
    ", we have @xmath35 and for magnetars , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the magnetar detection probability .",
    "magnetars are characterized by a flat spectral index , i.e. , their luminosities appear to be independent of the observing frequency . under this assumption we derive the magnetar detection probability from the normal pulsar detection probability as @xmath38 and @xmath39 becomes @xmath40 .",
    "to avoid any bias in our analysis , we adopt non - informative priors for @xmath24 and @xmath31 ( i.e. , uniform probability within given ranges stated below ) . for @xmath12 , we use the results of @xcite and take @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean spectral index and @xmath43 is the standard deviation . the final bayesian relation can then be written as @xmath44 this is then integrated over @xmath31 and @xmath12 to obtain the marginalized posterior of @xmath24 , @xmath45 .",
    "we applied our technique to the surveys of the gc analyzed by @xcite , namely those discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in applying our analysis to these past surveys",
    ", we made the reasonable assumption that , had the magnetar become active earlier , all these surveys would have detected it .",
    "we computed the survey sensitivity limits based on information provided in those papers , and additionally performed a normalization to ensure that the minimum flux density values are average values over the part of the beam that cover the inner 1 pc of the gc , modelling each beam as a gaussian .",
    "we used the broad ranges of [ 1 , 10@xmath46 for @xmath24 and",
    "[ 0.001 , 0.999 ] for @xmath31 .",
    "we found that for the more sensitive surveys @xcite , the mean of the posterior on @xmath24 is in the range 8003000 and the 99 per cent upper limit is in the range 1200047000 .",
    "our results are tabulated in table  [ tab_res ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_pdf ] shows the posterior probability density functions of @xmath24 derived from each of the surveys listed in table  [ tab_res ] .     for each of the surveys listed in table  [ tab_res ] .",
    "[ fig_pdf ] ]    .results of our analysis for a few gc surveys .",
    "@xmath47 is the expected value of @xmath24 while @xmath48 is the 99% upper limit on @xmath24 .",
    "[ tab_res ] [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < \" , ]     our mc technique described in  [ sec_mc ] yields a conservative upper limit of @xmath0 200 potentially observable pulsars , whereas our bayesian technique yields broader constraints that are an order of magnitude larger .",
    "further deep surveys of the gc in the radio , and monitoring for x - ray outbursts from potential magnetars in the region will help conclusively establish the size of the gc pulsar population .",
