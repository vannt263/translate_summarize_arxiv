    "the most massive galaxies in the local universe reside at the centers of galaxy clusters . often called brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , they exhibit , as a class , highly uniform properties such as luminosity , metallicity and surface brightness profiles , and are distinct from the general galaxy population @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest formation processes which are themselves distinct from those which dominate in massive galaxies elsewhere in the cluster or in the field .",
    "the mass growth of bcgs is likely linked to the overall physics of hierarchical structure formation on galaxy cluster scales , including the fundamental processes of gas cooling , star formation , energy feedback and galaxy mergers at the centers of giant dark matter halos .",
    "within the current suite of semi - analytic models ( sams ) bcg evolution follows a relatively simple prescription @xcite . at very early times ( @xmath14 )",
    "cooling flows dominate the stellar mass assembly at the centers of clusters , but these are rapidly suppressed through active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback @xcite .",
    "bcg growth then continues over time through the accretion of smaller systems , with little additional star formation . in this picture",
    "most of the stellar mass is formed at very high redshifts ( @xmath15 5 ) within multiple galaxies through low levels of star formation , and the bcg slowly acquires its identity through the conglomeration of previously assembled pieces .",
    "this is supported by direct measurements of the mass growth of bcgs below @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "still , there are observational examples of moderate redshift bcgs ( @xmath16 ) that present signs of high star formation rates ( sfrs ) ( 10 - 1000@xmath6yr@xmath12 ) and/or contain large amounts of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "such active bcgs are rare and have primarily been seen in x - ray - selected cool - core clusters . in many cases",
    "the sfrs are correlated with the gas cooling time .",
    "the paucity of these systems at low / moderate redshifts indicates that explosive star formation , fed by the cooling of halo gas , is not an important contributor to bcg mass growth , relative to the process of dry merging .    while it is established that a large fraction ( 50% ; lidman et al .",
    "2013 ) of the stellar mass of bcgs is already in place at @xmath15 1 , it is not yet determined if this mass was assembled through processes similar to those at lower redshift ( _ i.e. _ , dry merging ) or if a different and perhaps more extreme phase of growth , such as that seen in some of the cool core clusters , becomes more common at earlier epochs .",
    "there are now several detections of clusters and massive groups at redshifts beyond @xmath15 1 @xcite and these systems offer the opportunity to study the build - up of the central stellar mass in detail .",
    "indeed many of these systems exhibit an increase in the star formation activity within several hundred kpc of their centers , compared to lower redshifts and , in some cases , the field @xcite .",
    "while studies of their bcgs , in particular , have not been undertaken , these results indicate that the cores of galaxy clusters may be active places beyond @xmath15 1.5 .    here",
    "we report the discovery of an optically rich cluster at @xmath171.7089 , that we label sparcs104922.6 + 564032.5 ( hererafter sparcs1049 + 56 ) .",
    "this system is distinguished by its extremely active bcg which is observed in an important phase of evolution .",
    "we appear to be witnessing the stellar mass build - up of the central bcg through a wet galaxy merger , a process which has , heretofore , not been thought to play an important role in bcg growth . in this paper",
    "we outline the discovery and characterization of this interesting system . in section 2",
    "we describe the data and observations ; in section 3 we present the analysis of the cluster and bcg properties ; and in section 4 we discuss the implication of these first results .",

    "we describe follow - up imaging with scuba2 on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and wfc3 on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) taken by our team subsequent to the cluster discovery ( described in section 3.1 ) .",
    "these data are focused on the location of the cluster and do not cover the entire lockman field .",
    "in section 2.3 we present the spectroscopic observations obtained by others before the discovery of the cluster and by ourselves following the discovery with keck - mosfire .",

    "we utilized the mosfire data reduction pipeline ( drp v20140610 ) for the first step in data reduction .",

    "all raw images were visually inspected for integrity before ingested into the drp ; any anomalous frames were thrown out .",
    "one step in the drp involves interactively fitting the wavelength solution based on the sky lines during which we attempt to fit the wavelength solution to have a maximum residual difference of @xmath46 pixels for any one skyline .",

    "typical extraction routines simply sum the the sky - subtracted image data from the two - dimensional spectrum over a range that encloses the object s spectrum in the spatial direction .",
    "our extraction applies a non - uniform pixel weighting , nominally gaussian in shape , to the extraction sum which increases the signal - to - noise of the resulting one - dimensional spectra .",
    "redshifts are determined from developed line fitting routines that simultaneously fit h@xmath39 and [ n@xmath40 doublet emission lines as well as a linear continuum component via a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach based on bayesian inference .",
    "redshift errors are determined from the addition in quadrature of the random error from the mcmc fit and the systematic error from the interactive wavelength fitting step of the drp .",
    "the position of the galaxy that we identify as the central bcg ( section 4.2 ) was serendipitously observed as part of an earlier _ spitzer_-irs survey of @xcite ( see section 3.3 for further discussion of the identification of the bcg with this observation ) .",
    "this program targeted infrared - bright systems ( s@xmath47 500mjy ) with infrared colors indicative of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the data acquisition , reduction and analysis are described in farrah et al . , and we use these measurements in section 3.3 .",

    "sparcs1049 + 56 is located within the lockman field ( the largest single field ) and is the second richest cluster detection above @xmath11 within the 35 square degrees .",
    "unfortunately , it lies close to a chip gap on the @xmath25 image and the outskirts of the northern half of the cluster lack coverage in this band .",
    "the keck - mosfire spectroscopy confirms the presence of a galaxy over - density at @xmath11 .",
    "an average around the @xmath15 1.7 peak produces a cluster redshift of @xmath0 . in figure [ histogram ]",
    "we show the distribution of 70 redshifts measured from four mosfire masks of 146 independent slits , over a field - of - view of @xmath3 6@xmath503 arcmin , and in figure [ color ] we show the physical locations of the galaxies with spectra .",
    "the distribution of confirmed cluster members ( see discussion below ) is spatially extended over several mpcs , but this is , in part , a consequence of our observing constraints rather than a reflection of the true spatial distribution .",
    "the mosfire design prohibits complete sampling of the core , due to a required minimum separation between slits , and thus the confirmed members are spatially spread out ( figure [ color ] ) .",
    "moreover , redshifts were obtained through the detection of h@xmath39 and this could impose a radial bias in the redshift success , since completely passive galaxies ( which may dominate within the core ) will not show emission lines .",
    "we estimate the cluster richness from the 3.6@xmath24 m ( rest - frame @xmath3j ) data to be @xmath5130 @xmath2 8 .",
    "we use the following definition of @xmath1 : the number of background - subtracted galaxies within a 500kpc radius of the cluster center brighter than @xmath52 + 1 based on a passive evolving luminosity function with @xmath53 = 10 @xcite . applying the conversion of @xcite this",
    "richness yields a mass within 500 kpc of ( 3.8@xmath21.2)@xmath5010@xmath5@xmath6 , where the uncertainty does not include redshift evolution in this relation .",
    "we note that in a richness - limited sample , such as this , there may be a bias toward systems with a high richness - to - mass relation .",
    "confirmation of this mass will require a gravitational lensing measurement or detection of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "currently there is no x - ray coverage of this object , and it is not expected ( given its estimated mass ) to appear as an sz decrement in the planck all - sky map @xcite .",
    "we classify as cluster members galaxies which lie within @xmath21500 km / s of the mean cluster redshift .",
    "this provides a sample of 27 cluster members within a cluster - centric radius of 1.8 mpc . a standard biweight - mean yields a velocity dispersion of 430@xmath54 km / s .",
    "we use the model calibrated relation between cluster viral mass and velocity dispersion to convert this to a virial mass of 8@xmath5510@xmath56 @xmath6 .",
    "however , @xcite have found that calculating the velocity dispersion using at least the brightest 30 red sequence galaxies within the virial radius is required to obtain the virial mass of a cluster to within 40% , whereas we have used 27 h@xmath39 emitters over a wider area .",
    "this region of the spectrum is also plagued by sky lines and does not allow us to fully , or symmetrically sample the redshift distribution .",
    "we therefore attach an uncertainty of at least 40% to this mass , or 8@xmath2 3@xmath5710@xmath56 @xmath6 .    although the mass is uncertain , we can add this system to the growing list of clusters and massive groups known around or above @xmath58 .",
    "the most massive published clusters are the @xcite system at @xmath59 ( idcsj1426 + 3508 ) with seven spectroscopically confirmed members and x - ray and sz detections that indicate a mass estimate of @xmath605@xmath5010@xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite , and the @xcite cluster with @xmath613.2@xmath6210@xmath5@xmath6 .",

    "large open red circles correspond to galaxies for which a spectrum was obtained , but no redshift was determined , due to a lack of features . these include fore / background systems and cluster members with no strong emission lines in the @xmath66-band , and emission - line cluster galaxies whose h@xmath39 line is masked by a sky - line .",
    "an over - density of red - sequence galaxies is observed ; this is expected since that is required for the initial cluster detection .",
    "we show the location of the red - sequence ( black line ) predicted for a single stellar population ( ssp ) formed at @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that all of the galaxies with colors consistent with the red sequence do not show evidence of strong line emission , implying the red sequence is already old and passive in this system . nor are the identified cluster members very blue , rather they clump just below the red - sequence in the approximate region of the `` green - valley '' .",
    "this might be explained by the two primary biases of the mosfire spectroscopic observations .",
    "targets were prioritized by @xmath68 - 3.6@xmath24 m color , to best select cluster members .",
    "this biases the spectroscopy toward red galaxies .",
    "however , redshifts required the detection of the h@xmath39 emission line , thereby requiring star formation . this combined selection could tilt the confirmed members toward the reddest emission - line galaxies , or those in the green valley .",
    "still , the presence of these systems may indicate that a significant fraction of the galaxies within sparcs1049 are transitioning from a star - forming episode to passive red - sequence galaxies .     of the cluster center .",

    "h@xmath39 was not observed for this galaxy , indicating it has a passively evolved stellar population ( and see section 3.3 ) with no measurable trace of star formation .",
    "however , the irac colors indicate , through the presence of the stellar photospheric feature at rest - frame @xmath71 m ( the stellar bump ) , a photometric redshift of @xmath11 .      the center of the cluster is coincident with a previously known ultraluminous infrared galaxy at @xmath11 in the farrah et al.(2012 ) irs study of extremely ir - bright high - redshift galaxies in swire .",

    "the spire data are publicly available and while there is emission coincident with bcg in the hermes 250@xmath24 m catalog @xcite , the increasing beam - size at 350 and 500@xmath24 m results in a highly confused image of the cluster core . however , utilizing positional priors from less - confused wavelengths can reduce the amount of source blending in far - infrared photometry . in particular , @xcite developed a novel algorithm called simstack to stack spire maps on prior positions from a user - defined catalog .",

    "we fit for the amplitude and then integrate under the infrared portion ( 8 - 1000@xmath24 m ) of the sed to obtain the total infrared luminosity .",
    "uncertainties on the luminosity are produced by fitting the extremes of the uncertainties / scatter on the composite template .",
    "the chary & elbaz templates , on the other hand , are derived from local galaxy templates and thus may not be appropriate for galaxies at @xmath82 2 .",
    "indeed , many studies have shown that using the ce01 seds to infer the l@xmath83 from a single 24@xmath24 m measurement over estimates the luminosity beyond @xmath84 @xcite . as explored by @xcite , however , this discrepancy is reduced when one considers the full range of ce01 templates , rather than pre - selecting a single template based on the observed 24@xmath24 m luminosity , and when fitting broader photometric coverage .",
    "we therefore adopt the following fitting method for these templates .",
    "we fit each available template ( 105 total variations ) to the data @xcite .",
    "we calculate uncertainties on the infrared luminosities using a bayesian approach .",
    "we calculate the normalized chi - square probability distribution as a function of chary & elbaz template and amplitude , ranging from 0 - 50 in steps of 0.05 .",
    "each value in this grid corresponds to an infrared luminosity , which can then be weighted by the normalized chi - square probability .",
    "the final uncertainty is given by the standard deviation of the weighted mean of the infrared luminosity : @xmath85 .",
    "in table [ sfrtable ] we summarize the results of these fits .",
    "formally , the best representation of the data is the ce01 sed this fit produces @xmath7 = 6.2@xmath20.9@xmath5010@xmath9 @xmath10 , with a @xmath86 .",
    "we note the uncertainty on this value is small because only a small set of ce01 seds accurately represent the data .",
    "the kirkpatrick model yields @xmath7=4.1@xmath2 1.5@xmath5010@xmath9 @xmath10 , with @xmath87 . as can be seen in figure [ sed ] ,",
    "the kirkpatrick model over - predicts the amount of long - wavelength emission in the rayleigh - jeans tail .",
    "however , the integrated luminosities of the two fits are consistent with each other at a level of @xmath88 .",
    "the lir emission can be converted to a sfr by applying the standard @xcite law , under the assumption that the dust is heated entirely by the stellar population with a salpeter imf , and these values are also included in table [ sfrtable ] .",
    "the ce01 fit yields a sfr of 1070@xmath2160 @xmath6yr@xmath12 , while the kirkpatrick fit produces 690@xmath2260 @xmath6yr@xmath12 .",
    "these estimates are in agreement with the upper - limit on the sfr placed by @xcite of @xmath89 @xmath6yr@xmath12 from the non - detection of the 6.2 @xmath24 m line .",
    "if an agn is contributing to the ir luminosity this estimate must be reduced , however the presence of the pah features in the spectrum , and the turn - over of the irac fluxes ( implying a lack of very hot dust ) , suggest that an agn does not dominate the luminosity . to investigate this we decompose the irs spectrum into a star forming and agn components following the method of @xcite .",
    "we find an agn contribution to the mir of 50% , corresponding to an agn contribution to the fir luminosity of @xmath320% .",
    "we therefore apply this downward correction to the sfr .",
    "this yields , for the best - fit sed , a sfr of 860@xmath2130 @xmath6yr@xmath12 .",

    "a color zoom - in of the central region is shown in figure [ hst ] . here",
    "we see a chain of small clumps arranged as `` beads on a string '' and covering a linear area of roughly 66 kpc .",
    "the clumps are embedded within diffuse emission which has the morphology of a single large tidal tail .",
    "this tail appears to begin 1@xmath69 east ( 8 kpc ) of the bcg , within its stellar envelope , and forms a distinct backwards j - like structure , ending to the south - west of the bcg .",
    "the morphology of this structure is reminiscent of interacting galaxies . in particular , it is similar to the long single tidal arms of the `` shrimp '' galaxies at @xmath15 1.4 classified by @xcite in the gems and goods fields .",
    "these systems appear to be higher redshift analogs of merging systems such as m51 or the antennae .",
    "they consist of a single large tail , defined by diffuse emission and composed of several distinct and regularly spaced clumps .",
    "the scale of the structure in sparcs1049 + 56 is similar to these , with a linear extent of 66 kpc , a width of @xmath35 kpc and clump spacing ranging from 1 to 2 kpc .",
    "the mips 24@xmath24 m emission peaks on one of the beads in the center of the tail and appears to be slightly extended along the direction of the tail ( figure [ hst ] )",
    "the unique feature of this cluster is its extremely active and infrared - luminous central object .",
    "we conclude , based on the presence of pah features and its nir colors , that the ir emission is dominated by star formation rather than an agn . the best sed fit yields l@xmath83 = 6.2@xmath91 10@xmath9 @xmath10 and a corresponding agn - corrected sfr of 860@xmath2130 @xmath6yr@xmath12 . in this respect",
    "the system is similar to the phoenix bcg @xcite within a @xmath92 spt cluster , but sparcs1049 + 56 is seen at a significantly earlier cosmological epoch . in both of these systems a substantial amount of gas is being delivered to the cluster center to fuel this intense starburst . in the case of the phoenix the gas is deposited by a rapidly cooling intracluster medium ( icm ) @xcite .",
    "x - ray imaging of the phoenix cluster indicates it has a cool core and deep optical and uv imaging and spectroscopy has revealed a network of large - scale gas filaments apparently streaming into the bcg @xcite .",
    "although no x - ray information exists for sparcs1049 , the nir ( rest - frame uv and optical ) data indicate a very different scenario . rather than a spider - web arrangement of filaments , the hst imaging shows a single tidal tail , with clumps along its length . while this does not rule out the deposition of gas by a cooling flow , the morphology is more consistent with starbursts induced by gas - rich mergers .",
    "though the phenomenon of mergers producing `` beads on a string '' tidal tails is well - established * to our knowledge * @xcite sparcs1049 is only the second example of such an event in the center of a galaxy cluster .",
    "recently , a similar object was reported by @xcite in a lower - redshift ( @xmath93 0.3 ) strong - lensing cluster , sdssj1531 + 3414 .",
    "this system is clearly associated with a major - merger consisting of the bcg and a massive companion .",
    "there are similarities between sparcs1049 and sdssj1531 + 3414 , namely the spacing of the beads ranges between 1 and 2.5 kpc and the linear extent is several tens of kpc long ( 66 kpc and 27 kpc respectively )",
    ". however , there are some key differences as well .",
    "firstly , a second massive galaxy , merging with the bcg is not obvious in sparcs1049 .",
    "the tidal tail appears to begin within the stellar envelope of the bcg with a smaller merging system that is spectroscopically confirmed to be within the cluster sitting at its tip .",
    "the tail may be associated with this system which itself is interacting with the bcg , but does not have a comparable mass .",
    "secondly , although the rest - frame filters are necessarily different the beads / clumps of sparcs1049 do not appear uniform in color , unlike those of sdssj1531 + 3414 .",
    "the clumps near the bcg - end of the tail are blue and similar in color to the merging pair at the tip , while the extended end of the tail has a color more consistent with the bcg itself . given that the mips emission is coincident with this second half of the tail , this may be due to extreme dust extinction in this region . finally , the scale of the star formation in sparcs1049 + 56 is extremely different .",
    "the total sfr of sdssj1531 + 3414 ( determined from h@xmath39 ) is 5 @xmath6yr@xmath94 , approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than we measure for sparcs1049 .    assuming that the stellar mass produced in the burst will eventually be incorporated into the bcg we can assess its importance through a rough estimate of the specific sfr . for this",
    "we simply use the total sfr as seen in the ir and the existing approximate mass of the bcg . to estimate the stellar mass we employ the color dependent rest - frame k mass - to - light ratio ( m / l@xmath95 ) calculated by @xcite , using the f160w - f105w color as an approximate rest - frame _ u - g_. this yields stellar mass of 3@xmath9610@xmath97 m@xmath98 , where the error reflects a 10% uncertainty in the photometry ( corrected to a salpeter imf @xcite ) . note that in the rest - frame k galaxies have a weak dependence of m / l on color : an uncertainty in color of @xmath20.5 would lead to an additional uncertainty of @xmath20.5@xmath5010@xmath97 @xmath6 .",
    "thus , although it is undergoing a very rapid starburst of 860@xmath6 yr@xmath12 , the specific sfr of the sparcs1049 + 56 bcg is a moderate @xmath3 3 - 5 gyr@xmath12 , in line with mass - extrapolated main sequence field galaxies at @xmath15 2 @xcite .",
    "this could imply that the mechanism of gas deposition is similar to that of the field at this redshift ( major gas - rich mergers ) , or that galaxy self - regulation operates in the same way to limit the star formation efficiency , regardless of the fuelling process .",
    "nevertheless , the inferred sfr of 860@xmath6 yr@xmath12 would double the stellar mass of the galaxy within roughly 400 million years therefore necessitating a rapid quenching mechanism .",
    "this is a similar timescale to that expected for a cooling flow of 100 - 500 myr @xcite , with subsequent shut - down by an emerging agn , but is also consistent with the gas depletion timescales for ulirg mergers @xcite .",
    "regardless of the central fueling mechanism , this is an optically rich cluster caught in the process of forming a large amount of stellar mass within the halo of its bcg . sparcs1049 + 56 therefore offers a new opportunity to study the interplay between the global cluster physics , be it the cooling of the gas halo or the interaction between infalling galaxies and the icm , and the evolution of the massive central galaxy within the system at a time when such processes may be more important to building clusters than today .",
    "the rapid growth of bcgs through large - scale cooling of the icm is a key ingredient at early times in sams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the supporting observational evidence is slim , largely because of the dearth of high - redshift ( @xmath99 ) over - densities available for study .",
    "evidence is mounting that growth of bcgs through dry mergers is an important process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these studies have been limited to @xmath15 1 .",
    "it may be that sparcs1049 + 56 is the first example of a new process , wet mergers of gas - rich galaxies , occurring in the core of a @xmath151.7 cluster .",
    "this paper presents the discovery and first analysis of a rich galaxy cluster at @xmath100 with a remarkable star - forming central galaxy .",
    "while much additional work must be done to characterize the cluster itself we can presently make the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "we have spectroscopically confirmed , through the presence of 27 member galaxies , an over - density of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the 3.6@xmath24 m photometric richness is measured to be @xmath1=30@xmath28 . applying standard , low - redshift , conversions ,",
    "the mass ( within 500kpc ) of the cluster is estimated to be @xmath3 3.8@xmath21.2@xmath5010@xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "the velocity dispersion , calculated from all 27 members over within 1.8 mpc of the bcg , is 430@xmath54 km / s , implying a lower mass of 8@xmath23@xmath5010@xmath56 @xmath6 .",
    "3 .   the brightest cluster galaxy is coincident with an ultra - luminous infrared galaxy with an estimated luminosity of l@xmath83 = 6.2@xmath20.9@xmath5010@xmath9 l@xmath98 .",
    "the presence of pah lines in its infrared spectrum and its rest - frame nir colours indicate this energy is dominated by star formation , with an agn corrected rate of of @xmath3 860@xmath2130 @xmath6 yr@xmath12 .",
    "this rate necessitates rapid gas deposition into the bcg system .",
    "deep hst nir imaging has revealed complex morphology within the core . a 66 kpc diffuse structure , reminiscent of a tidal tail , appears to emanate from the bcg .",
    "this structure contains several ( @xmath1310 ) clumps of objects along its length , aligned as `` beads on a string '' .",
    "the mips emission is coincident with a set of red beads in the center of the tail .",
    "the overall arrangement of the system suggests that the star formation is being driven by gas - rich galaxy - galaxy interaction , possibly involving the bcg .",
