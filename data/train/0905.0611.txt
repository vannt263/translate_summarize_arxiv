    "there is a great interest today to study the phenomena of quantum transport in low dimensional systems , both from a technological and a fundamental point of view .",
    "especially important are questions of spin polarized transport , also known as spintronics .",
    "@xcite a famous example is the proposition of the datta - das transistor @xcite which uses the rotation of the electron spin due to spin - orbit ( so ) coupling .",
    "there are two sources of spin - orbit coupling in quasi one - dimensional systems ( 1d ) , an intrinsic one due to the lack of inversion symmetry in certain crystal structures ( dresselhaus term ) @xcite and an external one triggered by an applied voltage to surface gates ( the rashba so coupling ) .",
    "@xcite    several works studied the so coupling and electronic transport in quasi 1d metallic systems .",
    "@xcite in contrast , the influence of so coupling and magnetic field on the transport in 1d band insulators is unexplored , and it can be expected to be fundamentally different . in the letter band insulators , we will report on two interesting effects : the complete spin filtering effect and the so induced metal - insulator transition .",
    "an incomplete spin filtering effect is possible in 1d metallic systems with a potential step or additional impurities , @xcite but the complete spin filtering as well as the spin - orbit induced metal - insulator transition which will be reported below are specific to 1d band insulators and can not be observed ( in principle ) in 1d metals .",
    "a prototype model for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) band insulator is a half - filled ionic chain with alternating on - site energies ( energy difference @xmath0 ) .",
    "such an ionic chain will be used in our study , however the obtained results are expected to be generic to any kind of 1d band insulators , including charge transfer insulators and realized in diatomic polymers , @xcite as well as the 1d peierls insulators , such as polyacetylene .",
    "@xcite in a wider sense , one - dimensional band insulators may also be realized in carbon - nanotubes .",
    "these nanotubes have the advantage that the value of the gap may be tuned in a very wide range from 600 mev ( for ( 12,0 ) nanotubes ) up to 8 mev ( for ( 13,0 ) nanotubes ) or even smaller values .",
    "@xcite    before presenting detailed calculations , let us start with some qualitative arguments .",
    "we first discuss transport in 1d band insulators in a magnetic field @xmath1 and in absence of so interaction .",
    "although the magnetic field induced metal - insulator and insulator - metal transitions have been the subject of studies for decades , @xcite in the context of transport in mesoscopic systems these effects have not been investigated in detail .",
    "as we show in this paper , in the limit of ultra - low temperatures ( @xmath2 ) and strong magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) the field induced insulator - metal transitions lead to the almost complete spin filtering effect , since in this case only one spin channel is open for transport at the fermi level .",
    "however , the metallic phase reached at @xmath3 shows unconventional and substantially different properties compared to a normal metal .",
    "as we will show , contrary to the usual 1d metallic phase , the rashba spin - orbit coupling opens up a gap again , leading to a spin - orbit induced metal - insulator transition .",
    "it is important to note that both effects , i.e. the complete spin filtering effect and the metal - insulator transition induced by the rashba spin - orbit coupling are very specific to 1d band insulators , and may not be observed in 1d metals .    rather than analyzing the effect of these transitions by computing the bulk transport properties of the chain , such as the conductivity , we choose to compute the current of a finite chain of such a material , whose extremities are connected to metallic electrodes .",
    "a bias is imposed between the electrodes in order to induce current flow . on the one hand it allows to probe the spin filtering effects in a setup which is close to experimental situations , on the other hand it also allows to investigate potential fluctuations of the current as a function of the chain length in the presence of so coupling . in particular",
    ", we will show that a complex behavior , with several periods and a complicated energy dependence is obtained in the presence of a band gap @xmath0 and a magnetic field ; this is totally different from the simple harmonic oscillations , with a period inversely proportional to the so coupling strength , obtained in the metallic case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the model and in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we discuss the spectrum of the infinite chain . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we discuss the method which is used to obtain the transport properties as well as physical results .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "we note first that the spin - orbit coupling can be generated by a voltage @xmath4 applied to external gates perpendicular to the current .",
    "this is known as rashba spin - orbit coupling , @xcite and defines the device studied in the present paper ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we consider a finite chain ( oriented in the @xmath5 direction ) connected to metallic leads .",
    "lateral metallic gates are placed so that to create an electric field which is perpendicular to both the chain and the magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) direction .",
    "is proportional to @xmath4.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    with these conventions the following hamiltonian describes the molecular chain : @xmath7 here the first contribution describes the kinetic energy in the tight binding model , the second one accounts for alternating on - site energies , the third term is the zeeman coupling ( magnetic field @xmath8 ) and the last term is the rashba so coupling ( strength @xmath9 ) .",
    "we consider a finite chain of length @xmath10 which is connected to left and right leads by tunneling amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "note that we investigate here the case of _",
    "nonmagnetic leads_. we assume that the so coupling vanishes in the leads and that the magnetic field only affects the central region significantly .",
    "to understand the magneto transport results it is useful to first consider the spectrum of ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "for clarity all spectra are plotted in the reduced brillouin zone @xmath13 $ ] associated with the presence ( possibly small ) of alternating on site energies .",
    "typically this spectrum consists of 4 branches and it can be obtained exactly : @xmath14 in the general case with spin - orbit coupling @xmath9 and in the presence of a magnetic field . it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] for different cases of @xmath0 and @xmath9 , with a non - zero magnetic field @xmath1 .    the upper left corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] depicts the trivial case of a non dimerized tight binding chain ( @xmath15 ) in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the latter gives rise to a splitting between the spin up and spin down bands .",
    "the spectrum has been folded in this reduced brillouin zone to serve as a point of comparison for the other cases , with dimerisation .",
    "we now consider the case of a non - zero value for @xmath0 ( bottom left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) . for @xmath16 , the spin up and down bands are still separated , but the dimerisation opens a gap for each spin band at the boundaries of the brillouin zone .",
    "this implies that for energies close to the fermi level only one spin channel will be open for the transport ( complete spin filtering effect , see next section ) .",
    "as shown on the figure , the magnetic field can be so strong that the gap closes and the system can become metallic .",
    "we now switch on the rashba coupling in the presence of dimerisation ( bottom right corner of  fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) . in this case , the coupling between spin up and spin down gives rise to an anticrossing , so that the spin - orbit coupling opens up a gap again .    )",
    "-([eq1a ] ) ) with magnetic field ( @xmath17 ) , with and without rashba coupling @xmath9 and ionicity @xmath0 ( @xmath18 has been taken as unit of energy).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    on the other hand , there is no spin filtering effect for a homogeneous , metallic chain ( @xmath15 , top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) . without magnetic field",
    "( not shown ) , the spin - orbit coupling can be taken exactly into account by a shift of @xmath19 . as can be easily inferred from the spin split band structure in a magnetic field ( left plot ) the density of states for spin up and spin down electrons",
    "is the same in that case . and the introduction of spin - orbit coupling ( right plot ) does not open a gap .",
    "this proves that both effects , i.e. the complete spin filtering effect and the spin - orbit driven metal - insulator transition can not be observed in a metallic system ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in the absence of electronic interactions , the current through a finite chain of length @xmath10 can be cast exactly in a landauer type formula , written here for zero temperature .",
    "this current depends on the orientation of electrons spin at the input lead and the output lead : the current @xmath21 for instance , corresponds to electrons which enter with spin @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) from the left lead and leave the current channel with spin @xmath24 to the right lead . with this convention ,",
    "@xmath25 the integration is peformed between the chemical potentials of the left and right leads ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the energy dependent transmission is simply proportional to the square modulus of the total retarded green function of the chain ( which include the coupling with the leads ) between both endpoints , noted here @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the tunneling rates on the left and right side are defined as @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , where @xmath32 is the ( constant ) density of states of lead @xmath33 , and @xmath34 the tunneling amplitude to lead @xmath33 .",
    "the total green function of the chain between the end sites @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath35 can be obtained from the green function of the bare chain ( uncoupled to leads ) @xmath36 by solving the dyson equations : @xmath37 and similar equations for the opposite spins , and where @xmath38 is the retarded self - energy coming from the coupling to lead @xmath31 .",
    "the green functions of the bare chain @xmath36 are obtained simply by computing the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the finite chain , and using a spectral representation : @xmath39 here all the green functions , and consequently the current in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , are 2x2 matrices in spin space .",
    "this is a consequence of the rashba so coupling , which couples the spin - up and spin - down channels . without so coupling all quantities become diagonal in spin space , and the formula for the total green function reduces to : @xmath40    let us start the discussion of our numerical results with the current - voltage characteristics in a magnetic field with @xmath41 , but without so coupling ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sf ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath42 is chosen such that it just closes the gap , but the exact value of this parameter is nevertheless not important for the _ spin - filtering effect_. the transport for drain voltages between @xmath43 and @xmath44 is only possible for one spin channel .",
    "it means that we find complete spin polarization in the transport channel ( connected to nonmagnetic leads ) and a complete spin - filtering .",
    "the spin polarization of the current is defined in the general case as @xcite @xmath45 as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : sf ] , the spin polarization remains finite ( but smaller than unity ) for larger voltages ( between approximatively 0.6 @xmath46 and 2.25 @xmath46 ) and disappears at approximatively 2.25 @xmath46 where the current reaches saturation ( all the electrons of the tight - binding band contribute ) .",
    "a finite spin polarization means also that the current creates a total magnetization @xmath47 in the transport channel of length @xmath10 .",
    "the value of the total magnetization is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 means the average velocity of the electrons which are active in the transport process ( ballistic transport ) .",
    "this spin - filtering effect is expected to work for a wide range of gap values .",
    "the voltage region where only one spin channel is open is determined by the applied magnetic field .",
    "this works also if the magnetic field is not sufficiently strong to close the gap .",
    "therefore , even materials with gap values of about 0.5 ev are possible candidates to show the complete spin - filtering effect .",
    "the onset of the minority spin channel ( at zero energy in fig.[fig : sf ] ) is given by the relative position of the chemical potential with respect to the upper band edge of the valence band which may vary from one experimental situation to another .",

    "in studying the combined effect of magnetic field and so interaction on the transport in 1d band insulators we found two interesting effects .",

    "we studied this effect here by connecting the conduction channels to nonmagnetic leads but the effect of magnetic leads is easy to imagine , at least qualitatively .",
    "then , spin filtering means high conductance for parallel magnetization in the leads and low conductance for antiparallel arrangement .",
    "we speculate that the voltage region of the spin filtering effect may be dramatically enhanced by the presence of magnetic impurities in the band insulator , due to the giant zeemann effect .",
    "this might be important for the experimental verification of our proposal .",
    "the second striking effect of this study appears in band insulators with small band gap that may be closed by a magnetic field . in that situation ,",
    "the so coupling leads again to an insulating behavior .",

    "therefore , we may propose a device in which the metal - insulator transition is controlled by the gate voltage via the rashba so term .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with 1d metallic systems , where the so coupling does not lead to any metal - insulator transition .",
    "we also showed the oscillations of the different current components with the chain length .",
    "whereas the simple oscillations in metallic systems are easy to understand , the oscillations are much more complex for band insulators . we have let a detailed analysis of these oscillations for further studies . in our calculations",
    "the band insulator was simulated by an ionic term of alternating on - site energies in the hamiltonian .",
    "but we think that our results are generic to any kind of band insulator . on the other hand ,",
    "the way in which coulomb correlations influence our results may be different from one microscopic hamiltonian to another .",
    "we expect that the coulomb correlation just scales the band gap ( either to larger or to smaller values ) and that the presented results should remain valid with effective parameters , however ."
