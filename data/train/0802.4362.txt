    "solitons are localized self - focusing wavepackets that can propagate over long distances without change in shape , and emerge from collisions unaltered .",
    "their existence is a common feature of nonlinear wave equations and consequently they are observed in many diverse physical systems including water waves , plasmas , nonlinear optics and particle physics @xcite .",
    "bose  einstein condensates ( bec ) in dilute atomic gases are well - described by a nonlinear schrdinger equation , known as the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , where the nonlinearity results from the atomic interactions ( collisions ) in the gas @xcite .",
    "such systems can support either _ dark _ solitons @xcite or _ bright _ solitons @xcite , depending on whether the atomic interactions are repulsive or attractive , respectively @xcite .",
    "bright matter - wave solitons manifest themselves as self - trapped condensates where the usual wavepacket dispersion is exactly balanced by the presence of attractive atomic interactions .",
    "their self - trapped nature offers many potential advantages for applications in atom optics and interferometry @xcite .",
    "the term _ quantum reflection _ refers to the process where a particle reflects from a potential without reaching a classical turning point and is a direct consequence of the wave nature of the particle .",
    "significant reflection occurs when the local wave vector of the particle @xmath0 changes by more than @xmath1 over a distance of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wave vector of the particle of mass @xmath4 far from the potential @xmath5 .",
    "this requires an abrupt variation in the potential @xmath5 , such as can be found in the vicinity of a solid surface .",
    "the demonstration of quantum reflection from solid surfaces is typically performed at grazing incidence in order to reduce the wave vector normal to the surface @xcite .",
    "the advent of ultracold and quantum degenerate atomic samples with large debroglie wavelengths opens up new possibilities to study quantum reflection at normal incidence with unprecedented control over the atomic motion .",
    "reflection probabilities as high as @xmath6 have been demonstrated for @xmath7 condensates incident on a solid silicon surface @xcite .",
    "more recently , the use of patterned silicon surfaces has resulted in reflection probabilities of @xmath8 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose the use of bright matter - wave solitons to probe and study quantum reflection from a solid surface at normal incidence . in section  [ sec : expt ]",
    "we present details of the proposed experimental scenario and describe how the absence of dispersion enables precise control of the velocity normal to the surface , crucial for the study of quantum reflection .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to a numerical study of the quantum reflection of bright matter - wave solitons . in section  [ sec : theory ] we present the theoretical framework for this investigation . in section  [ sec : tanh ] we highlight the signatures of quantum reflection by considering the reflection of a soliton from positive and negative step potentials .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : cp ] we investigate the quantum reflection from a purely attractive casimir - polder atom - surface potential and show that reflection probabilities in excess of @xmath9 are feasible from bulk surfaces .",
    "the proposed experimental scenario for the study of quantum reflection is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : surface ] .",
    "the bright matter - wave soliton will be formed in an optical trap @xcite from an @xmath10 condensate @xcite with attractive interactions , initially located @xmath11 from the surface of a highly - polished glass prism .",
    "full three dimensional confinement of the initial condensate is provided by two intersecting laser beams @xcite .",
    "the first is a focussed @xmath12 beam that forms a radial waveguide with typical harmonic trap frequencies of up to @xmath13 radially and below @xmath14 axially .",
    "the second beam , from a @xmath15 @xmath16 laser , is only weakly focussed and intersects the first at @xmath17 .",
    "this beam provides the majority of the axial confinement and has no effect on the radial confinement .",
    "this two - beam configuration is chosen so that the harmonic confinement along the waveguide can be altered . in particular , by exploiting the deflection from an acousto - optic device controlling the second beam ,",
    "the point of intersection of the two beams can be altered leading to real time control of the trap centre along the waveguide .",
    "this in combination with the control of the optical power in the second beam allows all parameters of the axial harmonic potential to be manipulated and permits the control of the velocity of the soliton along the waveguide .",
    "for example , following the formation of the soliton at the intersection of the two beams , the axial trapping beam can then be shifted in position along the waveguide causing the soliton to be accelerated towards the surface .",
    "removal of the axial trapping potential when the soliton passes through the trap centre leads to a velocity defined by the displacement and strength of the axial trapping potential . the precise control over the parameters of the axial trapping beam afforded by standard optical techniques yields precise control over the velocity of the soliton .",
    "laser beam .",
    "a high power @xmath16 beam intersecting the waveguide at @xmath17 permits the independent , real time control of the axial trapping .",
    "an optional repulsive evanescent field can be added through the total internal reflection of a @xmath18 laser beam in the prism .",
    "the inset shows the total potential ( red ) experienced by the atoms in the vicinity of the surface as the sum of the casimir - polder potential ( purple ) and the evanescent field ( blue ) . ]      to date , the creation of bright matter - wave solitons @xcite has been demonstrated by three groups at ens in paris @xcite , rice university @xcite and , more recently , jila @xcite .",
    "all three experiments use a feshbach resonance @xcite to switch the atomic interactions from repulsive to attractive , triggering the collapse instability of the condensate @xcite , out of which the solitons emerge .",
    "the paris and rice experiments both used a resonance in the @xmath19 @xmath20 state at @xmath21 , and released the condensates into a quasi-1d optical waveguide in order to demonstrate the solitonic character of the attractive condensates .    here",
    "we consider the use of solitons formed from @xmath10 condensates in the vicinity of the @xmath22 broad feshbach resonance at @xmath23 used in the jila experiment @xcite .",
    "the experiment at jila demonstrated the controlled creation of both single and multiple solitons and revealed interesting soliton dynamics relevant to the present study . in the case where two solitons were created in the radially symmetric trap ,",
    "the solitons were observed to oscillate along the weaker axial direction repeatedly colliding in the trap centre .",
    "the amplitude of the these oscillations corresponds to a soliton velocity at the trap centre of @xmath24 .",
    "this velocity associated with the formation of the solitons for the jila parameters is of the correct order of magnitude required for the observation of appreciable quantum reflection from a surface @xcite .      at distances greater than the atomic scale ,",
    "the interaction potential of a neutral atom and a solid surface takes the form of an attractive power - law potential . for distances , @xmath25 , shorter than @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the wavelength of the dominant atomic transition , the potential @xmath28 , has the form of a dipole - dipole interaction between the spontaneous atomic dipole and its image @xcite . at larger distances",
    "the potential becomes @xmath29 due to retardation of the electrostatic interaction ; the well  known casimir ",
    "polder result @xcite .    in the low energy limit @xmath30 , the reflection probability @xmath31 for a particle incident normally on a surface tends to unity as @xmath32 @xcite , where @xmath33 is the length scale associated with the @xmath34 coefficient , @xmath35 .",
    "the observation of quantum reflection therefore requires a low incident velocity and a weak attractive force to the surface .",
    "such conditions were first realized using helium or hydrogen atoms incident on liquid helium surfaces @xcite or , for solid surfaces , by working at grazing incidence @xcite . more recently",
    ", quantum reflection at normal incidence from a solid surface has been demonstrated using a @xmath7 condensate incident on a silicon surface at very low velocities @xcite .",
    "however , in the low velocity limit @xmath36 the large spatial extent of the ( repulsive ) condensate leads to anomalous reflection , as the front reflects before the tail producing a standing wave that generates dynamical excitations that disrupt the atom cloud @xcite . here we demonstrate that the use of well  localized matter  wave solitons will eliminate this problem .",
    "this coupled to the precise control of the velocity of the soliton , stands to take the study of quantum reflection to a new level .",
    "the experimental configuration also allows for the addition of a repulsive ( or attractive ) evanescent field in the vicinity of the surface formed by the total internal reflection of a blue ( or red ) detuned laser field within the glass prism .",
    "this produces a potential which decays exponentially with distance from the surface ; the decay length being determined by the laser wavelength , the refractive index of the prism and the angle of incidence of the laser beam .",
    "when combined with the atom - surface potential , the repulsive evanescent field leads to a repulsive barrier of finite height , in close proximity to the surface ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : surface ] ) .",
    "studies of classical reflection from such a barrier can be used to probe the atom - surface potential @xcite . here",
    "the low incident velocities of the solitons leads to the peak of the repulsive barrier being located well into the casimir - polder regime , unlike in the earlier experiments with atoms dropped from a magneto - optical trap @xcite .",
    "for example , we estimate that for a soliton incident with a velocity of @xmath37 , setting the barrier height to be equal to the kinetic energy of the soliton leads to the peak being @xmath38 from the surface .",
    "moreover , the addition of both repulsive and attractive evanescent fields can be used to engineer a potential in the vicinity of the surface that significantly enhances the quantum reflection probability @xcite .",

    ", the wavefunction can be considered `` frozen '' in the radial direction to the non - interacting harmonic oscillator ground state . by integrating out this dimension , a one - dimensional gpe is obtained in terms of the axial dimension _ x _ with an effective interaction coefficient @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the radial harmonic oscillator length .",

    "when the potential is weakly - varying in space , the 1d soliton , to first order , behaves like a classical particle .",
    "such classical behaviour has recently been studied for matter - wave bright solitons by martin _",
    "@xcite , following analogous particle approaches in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "quantum reflection , however , dominates in the opposite regime of large potential gradients where classical particle analogies are no longer valid .",
    "the quantum reflection of matter - wave solitons from a purely attractive potential well has been theoretically studied @xcite . in that case a sharp switching between the transmission and reflection of the soliton was observed , with bound states of the well playing a key role in the dynamics .    in three - dimensions",
    ", the presence of radial confinement ( @xmath56 ) supports a 3d soliton which is self - trapped in the axial direction @xcite .",

    ", we will restrict our analysis to @xmath58 .",

    "the soliton is initially positioned a large distance @xmath62 to the left of the surface where the surface potential is negligible . since we typically consider an axially - untrapped geometry ( @xmath63 ) , a velocity kick to the soliton is required to induce the dynamics .",

    "note that this soliton - step scenario is analogous to the propagation of optical bright solitons at the interface between two nonlinear dielectric media of different refractive indices @xcite .",
    "when the soliton is small compared to the lengthscale of the step ( @xmath77 ) , the soliton will behave similarly to a classical particle .",

    "it is also interesting to mention analogous studies of dark matter - wave solitons interacting with step potentials .",

    "this variety of soliton shows no evidence of quantum reflection when incident on a negative step potential @xcite .",

    "we have also calculated the corresponding reflection probabilities for a non - interacting plane wave .",
    "this is performed numerically by dividing the smooth potential into many small intervals , each of which has constant potential across the interval .",
    "the problem is thereby approximated by a series of sharp finite potential steps , where the reflection at finite step is given by the standard analytic solution of the schrdinger equation and the overall reflection probability is simply the product of these individual reflection probabilities .",

    "the quantum reflection curves have identical qualitative form , tending towards unity in the limit of zero speed , and decaying towards zero as the speed is increased .",
    "maximum quantum reflection is seen for a sharp step @xmath84 , as expected since the potential gradient experienced by the soliton is maximal .",
    "accordingly , for larger widths , the potential gradient is reduced and the reflection probability decreases .",

    "there is a narrow region of transition which is centered on the classical critical speed @xmath106 .",
    "while the gpe results vary smoothly from unity to zero , the plane wave predictions drop suddenly from unity at @xmath106 and decay smoothly for @xmath107 .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the soliton features a smooth range of velocity ( momentum ) component , unlike the single - momentum plane wave . as the step becomes wider , the transition region becomes narrower as the soliton behaves more classically .",

    "[ fig : snaps](c ) shows soliton @xmath110 after 300 ms .",
    "the condensate is now considerably more elongated .",
    "this is because the soliton has lost many atoms ( @xmath152 ) and hence its axial size , which scales like @xmath153 , grows considerably .",
    "the reflection process may also excite shape excitations in the outgoing soliton .",
    "if such excitations are sufficiently large , kinetic effects may overcome the attractive interactions and lead to the formation of a dispersive wavepacket , as predicted by a variational approach @xcite .",
    "note that a change in the scattering length following the reflection could be used to preserve the solitonic nature of the condensate .",
    "the small modulations observed in the density are propagating sound waves .",
    "note that the condensate s density profile has no major nodes or topological excitations following reflection .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the low velocity quantum reflection of condensates with repulsive interactions @xcite where lobes and vortices were seen to form . for the condensates considered here ,",
    "the attractive interactions resist the formation of such features because low density regions have higher mean - field energies . in this case",
    ", the condensate has a low kinetic energy ( @xmath154j ) compared with the interaction energy ( @xmath155j ) so interaction effects dominate the condensate s behaviour .",
    "we now analyse the higher velocity case for soliton @xmath110 .",
    "the soliton starts as before [ fig .",
    "[ fig : snaps](d ) ] .",
    "at 38 ms the soliton is just starting to move away from the surface [ fig .",
    "[ fig : snaps](e ) ] .",
    "a density node has formed in the cloud ( indicated by small arrows ) because the de broglie wavelength , @xmath113 @xmath49 m , is similar to the longitudinal diameter of the condensate and the condensate s kinetic energy is sufficient to overcome the interactions resistance to sharp features .",
    "interestingly , the node is very well defined when compared with the non - interacting and repulsive interaction cases @xcite .",
    "it extends all the way to zero density and leaves a comparatively large volume where we do not expect to find many atoms .",
    "this is due to the mean field attractive interactions which naturally pull atoms away from energetically unfavourable lower density areas .",
    "[ fig : snaps](f ) shows the condensate s density after reflection at @xmath156 ms .",
    "again we observe an elongation of the cloud because the condensate has lost atoms , and hence its ability to self - trap . as in the low velocity case ,",
    "the calculations reveal no vortices or topological excitations but do show modulations due to propagating sound waves .",
    "the density node , formed during reflection , is still present in the density profile ( indicated by small arrows ) .",
    "although the interactions initially resist such features , once there is enough kinetic energy to form them , this configuration is stable .",
    "there is a possibility that reflection processes can trigger a collapse in attractive condensates if the spatial compression at the surface causes the peak density to rise above a certain value @xcite .",
    "although the peak density in these calculations does increase by a factor of up to @xmath157 , we see that this never triggers collapse for the parameters considered here . by analogy to collisions of solitons with @xmath59 phase differences we would expect collapse instabilities to occur for intermediate speeds and for solitons that are themselves closer to collapse @xcite .",
    "[ fig : refprobs ] shows how the reflection probabilities , @xmath31 , of soliton @xmath110 ( dotted line , square points ) and soliton @xmath111 ( dashed line , circular points ) vary with incident velocity @xmath65 .",
    "both curves show the qualitative trend expected for a non - interacting wave packet i.e. @xmath31 decreases with increasing @xmath65 .",
    "the different propagation methods have little influence on the reflection probability and the two curves approximately overlap .",
    "as noted before , the phase imprint method makes it straightforward to use lower velocities , hence we can reach @xmath90 mm s@xmath67 without introducing any complications associated with the initial state touching the surface . for this low velocity",
    "we predict @xmath158 .",
    "this is comparable with the highest reflection probabilities observed in experiments and simulations with sodium atoms in spite of the fact that the rubidium atom is almost four times heavier and no nanofabrication technique has been used to enhance the reflectivity of the surface @xcite .",
    "this is primarily because lower velocities can be readily attained using attractive becs due to their small spatial extent and ability to self - trap .",
    "reflection probabilities , @xmath31 , plotted against incident velocity , @xmath65 , for 3d @xmath68rb condensates reflecting from a planar si surface .",
    "the dotted curve with square points is for @xmath68rb bec @xmath110 which only has radial confinement and the dashed curve with circular points is for the @xmath68rb bec @xmath111 with in a 3d harmonic trap .",
    "the inset shows @xmath159 for a @xmath160na bec with repulsive interactions ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "we now make a simple comparison between quantum reflection of condensates with attractive interactions and condensates with repulsive interactions .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : refprobs ] shows @xmath31 plotted against @xmath65 for simulations of a @xmath160na bec , which is taken to be one - dimensional in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "the trap frequency is @xmath161 and the wavefunction is normalised such that @xmath162 atoms m@xmath116 as in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "repulsive condensates do not self - trap , hence we use the trap displacement method to propel the bec along the @xmath25-axis towards the surface .",
    "we model the reflection process using the 1d gross - pitaevskii equation with the casimir - polder potential assuming @xmath163 and @xmath164 nm .    we immediately see that unlike the attractive case , reflection probabilities do not continue to rise as @xmath165 , but rather saturate at a maximum value , @xmath166 . this occurs because , at low @xmath65 , the condensate spends a long time in contact with the surface where the curvature of the wavefunction is high .",
    "combined with the repulsive nature of the interactions , this creates a quantum pressure which drives atoms onto the surface .",
    "this problem is particularly acute for the repulsive condensates we consider here because the trap displacements required to attain low @xmath65 are lower than the longitudinal diameter of the condensate which therefore starts in contact with the surface and remains in contact throughout the simulation .",
    "an attractive condensate in the form of a soliton , on the other hand , prefers to avoid contact with the surface .",
    "it is , in fact , impossible to create an attractive condensate ground state with significant initial surface contact because the wavefunction finds sharp features energetically unfavourable and subsequently moves away from the surface to avoid creating high levels of quantum pressure .",
    "attractive condensates have a further advantage in that they also move away from absorbing potentials - it is possible to reflect an attractive condensate from a purely absorbing imaginary potential which has no variation of its real part .",
    "this is because the absorbing region of the potential draws atoms out of the condensate , thereby raising its energy and causing the condensate to move away from this region .",
    "in conclusion we have presented details of a proposal to use bright matter - wave solitons to probe and study quantum reflection from a solid surface at normal incidence .",
    "we have demonstrated that condensates with attractive interactions have a number of advantages in terms of quantum reflection . the absence of dispersion as the soliton propagates allows for precise control of the velocity normal to the surface and for much lower velocities to be achieved .",
    "our numerical results show that the robust , self - trapped nature of bright solitons leads to a clean reflection from the surface , limiting the disruption of the density profile .",
    "this permits accurate measurements of the reflection probability which can easily exceed @xmath9 and offers a new method to probe the atom - surface potential .",
    "such sensitive measurements in close proximity to a massive object may , in the future , present a new method to test the short range corrections to gravity due to exotic forces beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "we thank j. brand for many stimulating discussions .",
    "we acknowledge support from the uk epsrc , the royal society ( slc ) , the canadian commonwealth scholarship program ( ngp ) and the australian research council ( amm ) .",
    "the experiments are actually performed in three - dimensions with varying degrees of transverse confinement . under these conditions ,",
    "the axially self - trapped condensate is strictly speaking a _ bright solitary wave _ ; the three - dimensional analog of the bright soliton . in line with the large body of published literature",
    ", however , we refer to these states as solitons .",
    "simulations and experiments have been performed in which the trap centre was not shifted all the way to the surface ( a. gnther and s. kraft and m. kemmler and d. koelle and r. kleiner and c. zimmermann and j. fortgh , phys .",

    "this forced the bec to rise up the far side of the harmonic trap and hence decelerate before striking the surface .",
    "this improves control of the impact speed , but the presence of the harmonic potential remains a complicating factor and can affect the condensate s dynamics ."
