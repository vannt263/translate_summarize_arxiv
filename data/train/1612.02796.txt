    "andreev reflection , the process of an incident electron(hole ) being retro - reflected as a hole(electron ) at a interface with a superconductor has been used as a spectroscopic probe for the amount of polarization in ferromagnets@xcite , to determine the pairing symmetry of high t@xmath0@xcite and ferromagnetic superconductors@xcite among many other uses . in this work",
    "we aim to use it as a spectroscopic tool to completely characterize a high spin molecule , especially its ground state spin , magnetic moment , strength and sign of its interaction with charge carriers in the system .",
    "high spin molecules(hsm ) or single molecule magnets ( smm ) have been around for 20 years or more .",
    "the main purpose of research in these is to design molecular magnets however another important direction is towards controlled concoction of stable high spin molecular complexes and their complete characterization , as regards the ground state spin properties of these molecules .",
    "for example , how these molecules interact with electron spin , their ground state spin and magnetic moment have been only deciphered via spectroscopic probes like- pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance(epr)@xcite , electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy(endor)@xcite or electron spin echo envelope modulation(eseem ) techniques .",
    "the problem with the aforesaid spectroscopic tools like epr , endor , eesem , etc are that they only probe one of the features like epr and endor can only probe the ground state spin while magnetic moment can be done only with eesem techniques .",
    "new techniques like infrared spectroscopy and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy have also been invoked recently@xcite to fully characterize hsm s , but as already mentioned the multiplicity of spectroscopic techniques increases the complexity of the problem .",
    "we propose that andreev reflection spectroscopy unlike the aforementioned techniques can be a `` one stop shop '' for characterizing the spin , magnetic moment and the exchange interaction of a hsm thus reducing the complexity involved .    in this work",
    "we not only show that andreev reflection@xcite can be an excellent tool to probe these aforesaid aims , we also explore the possibilities of utilizing high spin molecules in superconducting spintronics applications .",
    "high spin molecules(hsm ) are of great import in molecular spintronics .",
    "they belong to the class of mettalo - organic compounds that portray superparamagnetic nature under a particular blocking temperature .",
    "these molecules can now be produced , for example , the molecule manganese acetate(@xmath1 ) , which has a large ground state spin ( @xmath2 ) , and a very slow relaxation of magnetization at low temperature .",
    "these molecules do not just have integer spin ; a number of hsms exist which have large half - integer spins like the @xmath3-complex@xcite with a spin of @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian@xcite for a hsm is given by- @xmath5 here first term represents the energy of the hsm .",
    "d is an uniaxial anisotropy constant and @xmath6 is the z component of the spin of the hsm .",
    "the second term is most relevant in our study as this deals with electron transport .",
    "the electrons interact with hsm only via the exchange term @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the strength of the exchange interaction , @xmath9 is the electronic spin and @xmath10 is the spin of the hsm or magnetic impurity .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of d in a realistic hsm is very small compared to @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the first term is only relevant in electronic structure calculations but it s not relevant for electronic transport calculations .",
    "thus , the only term of interest in our aims to use andreev reflection as a spectroscopic probe to characterize a hsm and for spintronics applications is the exchange coupling(2nd term ) .",
    "the exact setting we will use is shown in fig .",
    "1 , it shows a hsm at @xmath11 and a delta potential barrier at @xmath12 . in the regions i(@xmath13 ) and ii(@xmath14 ) there are two normal metals while for @xmath15 there is a s - wave superconductor .",
    "we study the andreev reflection enabled transport across this junction especially concentrating on below the gap regime of the superconductor .",
    "we consider unpolarized electrons incident at the junction and show how the differential charge and spin conductance vary with the impurity spin s and z - component of the impurity spin @xmath16 respectively . from the values of the differential spin and charge conductance we can get the exact values of the exchange interaction strength , ground state spin and magnetic moment of the molecule .",
    "we also study the spin and charge conductance through the junction and its possible applications in superconducting spintronics@xcite .",
    "particularly , we focus on conditions for obtaining pure spin conductance in absence of any charge conductance",
    ". thus the twin objectives of this study are : a. to characterize the ground state spin , magnetic moment and exchange interaction of a hsm and b. to exploit quantum transport across this normal metal - hsm - normal metal - insulator - superconductor(nmnis ) junction to design a pure spin conducting device .",
    "the rest of the paper are organized as follows : in the succeeding section ( theory ) , we first outline a brief sketch of our set - up and provide a theoretical background to our study by writing the hamiltonian and solving the equations after imposing boundary conditions on the wavefunctions .",
    "we plot the andreev and normal reflection probabilities and see the effect of the spin of hsm on these probabilities both for transparent as well as tunneling regimes .",
    "we also define the differential charge and spin conductance and give expressions for both the conductances in certain limits .",
    "we end the `` theory '' section by tabulating all the results for the charge and spin conductance in a table .",
    "the section after theory deals with the first objective of this work , i.e. characterization , in three separate subsections as well as two extensive tables and three elaborate figures we explain the way to characterize the hsm via only the differential charge and spin conductance .",
    "the section after characterization deals with the second aim of this work namely applications in superconducting spintronics , we show how we can utilize our set - up to have pure spin conductance in absence of any charge conductance .",
    "finally we conclude our study with a section on conclusion and a perspective on future endeavors .",
    "we also provide an appendix wherein details of the calculations are provided .",
    "we consider a metal(n)-metal(n)-superconductor(s ) junction where there is a hsm between two metallic regions at @xmath17 and a @xmath18-like potential barrier exists at metal superconductor interface at @xmath19 . when an electron with energy e and spin(@xmath20 ) is incident from the normal metal , at the @xmath11 interface it interacts with the hsm through an exchange potential which may induce a mutual spin flip .",
    "the electron can be reflected back to region i , or transmitted to region ii , with spin up or down .",
    "when this transmitted electron is incident at @xmath12 interface it could be reflected back from the interface and there is also possibility of andreev reflection , i.e. , a hole with spin up or down is reflected back to region ii .",
    "electron - like and hole - like quasiparticles with spin up or down are transmitted into the superconductor for energies above the gap .",
    "the model hamiltonian in bogoliubov - de gennes formalism of our normal metal - insulator - magnetic molecule - normal metal - superconductor system is given below : @xmath21 further in @xmath22 the first term is the kinetic energy of an electron with effective mass @xmath23 , for second term @xmath24 is the strength of the @xmath18-like potential at the interface between normal metal and superconductor and the third term describes the exchange interaction of strength @xmath8 between the electron with spin @xmath25 and a magnetic molecule with spin @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the fermi energy .",
    "the wavefunctions of the different region of the system as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath54 we take @xmath55 we impose the boundary conditions on the above wave - functions and solve the resulting @xmath56 equations and get the different scattering amplitudes : @xmath57 , see appendix . the reflection and transmission probabilities we get are thus- @xmath58 , @xmath59 , these are plotted in figures below .",
    "-0.2 in    -0.2 in    -0.2 in    -0.2 in      in fig .  2 we plot the normal and andreev reflection probabilities with spin - flip or no - flip for different values of the spin of magnetic molecule @xmath60",
    ", we fix the magnetic moment of the molecule- @xmath61 and we take @xmath62- the transparent regime . in fig .",
    "2(a ) we see normal reflection probability without spin flip increases with increase of spin of magnetic molecule ( s ) , while in 2(b ) normal reflection probability with spin flip shows a mixed behavior it first increases then decreases with increase of s , this is for the entire range of electron excitation energy .",
    "next in fig .",
    "2(c ) we plot andreev reflection without spin flip , for increasing spin it continuously decreases for both above as well as below the gap . finally , in fig .",
    "2(d ) we plot the andreev reflection probability with spin flip , we find both above as well as below the gap , probability decreases as we spin increase .",
    "thus , for a high spin molecule , normal reflection probability is large but andreev reflection probability is small .",
    "andreev reflection , hence is inhibited by the spin of magnetic molecule .",
    "this behavior , especially for large s , has similarities as well as differences with seen for a ferromagnet - insulator - superconductor junction@xcite .",
    "so , although it is one of the main aims of high spin molecule research to design single molecule magnets , one of the conclusions of our work is that high spin molecules are not ferromagnets .    in fig .  3",
    ", we plot the quasiparticle transmission probabilities for spin flip and without spin flip for same parameter values as in fig .  2 .",
    "since there is no quasiparticle transmission below the gap we will only focus on above the gap regime . in fig .",
    "3(a ) we show that with increase in spin of magnetic molecule ( s ) the electron - like quasiparticle transmission without flip decreases on the other hand in fig .",
    "3(b ) with increase in spin of magnetic molecule ( s ) the electron - like quasiparticle transmission with flip increases .",
    "thus high spin molecules inhibit no flip transmission but boost transmission with spin - flip for electron - like quasiparticle . in fig .",
    "3(c ) and ( d ) we plot the probability for hole - like quasiparticle transmission , in ( c ) we see that with increase in spin of magnetic molecule ( s ) the probability for no - flip transmission increases while in ( d ) we see the opposite . thus high spin molecules show opposite behavior for holes , they inhibit spin - flip transmission while giving a boost to no - flip transmission .    while figs .  2 and 3 dealt with reflection and transmission in the transparent ( z=0 ) regime , in figs .   4 and 5 we deal with the tunneling ( z=3 ) regime , other parameters remain same . in fig",
    "4(a ) we see the normal reflection probability in absence of spin flip increases with increase of the spin(s ) of magnetic molecule , while the normal reflection probability with spin flip decreases with spin(s ) .",
    "since in the tunneling regime andreev reflection by default is inhibited the addition of magnetic molecule enhances normal reflection and further inhibits andreev reflection for both spin - flip and no - flip cases . finally , in fig .",
    "5 we plot the quasiparticle transmission probabilities .",
    "we see in all cases increasing spin ( s ) of magnetic molecule leads to a continuous decrease of both electron - like and hole - like transmission probabilities .",
    "further , in the tunneling regime the differences between spin states of the hsm are almost obliterated .",
    "similar to above , if we consider an electron with spin down incident from normal metal region i , and get the different reflection and transmission probabilities as follows : @xmath63 , and for quasiparticle transmission above the gap @xmath64 .",
    "as we solve for the scattering amplitudes when electron with spin up is incident , we can also do the same for a spin down incident electron .",
    "we do not repeat them here but in analogy to spin up case the wavefunctions can be easily written .      to calculate the total differential spin conductance , we follow the well established definitions as in ref .  [ ] .",
    "the spin conductance of the set - up as envisaged in fig .",
    "1 is given by- @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 so , @xmath68 while the net differential charge conductance is deined as @xcite- @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 so , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the probability of andreev reflection of an electron(spin up)as hole(spin up ) .",

    "+ next the differential charge conductance : @xmath92 where @xmath93 similar to the differential spin conductance , the charge expression is also independent of @xmath94 , and dependent on @xmath89 , electron energy @xmath53 , exchange interaction magnitude @xmath90 and its sign and finally it depends on the spin @xmath91 and magnetic moment @xmath16 of the hsm .",
    "the reason this dependence / independence becomes crucial is that these factors become the key determinant for both characterization of hsm as well as in the spintronic applications which will be dealt with in the latter sections .    in the above equations , the spin - flip probabilities for electron",

    "similarly , the differential spin conductance at zero bias ( @xmath99 or without any voltage bias applied to normal metal region i ) for transparent junction ( @xmath62 ) : @xmath104 where @xmath105 again the above expression for spin conductance is independent of @xmath94 and sign of exchange interaction but dependent on magnitude of exchange interaction and the spin and magnetic moment of hsm .",

    "thus , in the tunneling regime @xmath106 and in absence of any voltage bias @xmath99 , we have pure spin conductance for our nmnis junction in absence of any charge conductance .",

    "<S> the ground state properties of a high spin molecule and its interaction with an electronic spin are probed via andreev reflection . </S>",
    "<S> we see that through the charge and spin conductance one can effectively estimate the interaction strength , the ground state spin and magnetic moment of any high spin molecule or for that matter any magnetic impurity . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how a high spin molecule at the junction between a normal metal and superconductor can contribute to superconducting spintronics applications . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , while spin conductance is absent below the gap for ferromagnet - insulator - superconductor junctions we show that in the case of a normal metal - high spin molecule - normal metal - insulator - superconductor(nmnis ) junction it is present . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show pure spin conduction without any accompanying charge conduction in specific regimes of the nmnis junction . </S>"
