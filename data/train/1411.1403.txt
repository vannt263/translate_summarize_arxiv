    "inside 150 au the majority of the nitrogen makes its way into  via chemical processing .",
    "this process is discussed in more detail in section 3.1.3 .    early in the chemical evolution of the disk , most of the hcn gas in the midplane either freezes out onto grains or is destroyed via gas phase reactions with ions .",
    "because of its high binding energy , it remains on grains for radii greater than 17 au .",
    "the same process occurs for the  and cn gas , resulting in a substantial fraction of the total nitrogen locked in hcn and  ices in the midplane beyond 17 au .",

    "the evaporation timescale increases with temperature , so as time passes larger radii begin to be affected by evaporation .",
    "for n the evaporation timescale in the midplane at 180 au is @xmath55 years .",

    "the formation of additional  depletes the no , such that model  has slightly lower no abundances than those seen in model ( gr ) . in the midplane",
    "the larger  abundance also leads to the creation of more @xmath1h@xmath2  beyond 300 au when compared to model ( gr ) . in the surface layers",

    "gas phase reactions are able to remove a larger fraction of the nitrogen from , most of which becomes n and  gas .",
    "model , where most of the nitrogen is initially in gas phase , results in a nitrogen partitioning very similar to that of model n ( figures [ n2contours1 ] - [ n2standard ] ) .",
    "that the differences are so subtle indicates that the disk is able to efficiently transfer n to , assuming there is no substantial processing of n on grains limiting the availability of atomic n in the gas .",
    "together , model n and model  illustrate that if the nitrogen is delivered to the disk primarily as either atomic or molecular nitrogen , the disk will likely be able to produce significant amounts of  gas via the reactions discussed previously .",
    "much of the chemistry explored in this work depends on the amount of nitrogen available for gas phase reactions . in other words",
    ", it depends on the desorption rates , which are extremely sensitive to the binding energies used .",
    "the residual midplane abundance of  in figure [ standardcontours1 ] is present because the evaporation temperature of  is low enough to allow gas phase  to exist in the midplane . in the absence of chemical processing the gas to ice ratio",

    "the strongest @xmath1h@xmath2  j=4 - 3 emission in models n and  originates between @xmath38 = 100 au and @xmath38 = 300 au in the midplane ( figure [ nnhprad ] ) , resulting in a ring of strong @xmath1h@xmath2  emission , similar to that seen in tw hya @xcite . in models  and ( gr ) a similar , though weaker , ring structure is seen beyond @xmath38 = 300 au .    figure [ snowother ] illustrates the midplane abundances in models , ( gr ) , and . together with figure [ snow ] they illustrate the gas phase  abundance in the @xmath1h@xmath2  emission region . in model n and model , the models with the strongest emission lines , at @xmath38 = 150 au in the midplane , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in comparison , for model  and model ( gr ) , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "when the gas phase  abundance drops below @xmath75 , @xmath1h@xmath2  is no longer present .",
    "thus , the strength of the @xmath1h@xmath2  line can be used as a proxy for the midplane  abundance between 100 and 300 au for an assumed ionization rate and disk structure .",
    "this is entirely consistent with earlier work attempting to determine the  abundance from @xmath1h@xmath2  in dense cores @xcite .",
    "@xmath1h@xmath2  has been observed in several disks @xcite .",
    "our models suggest that for @xmath1h@xmath2  to be strongly emissive there must be a significant gas phase  abundance .",
    "it is likely that the mere detection of the @xmath1h@xmath2  ( 4 - 3 ) line at the level @xmath36 jy at 54 pc , e.g. @xcite , implies @xmath3 .",
    "the distribution of no shows some variance between our models . for all of our models",
    "it is present in the surface layers .",
    "however , in model ( gr ) and model  it is also abundant in the warm molecular layer .",
    "model n , model ( gr ) and model  all show a high no abundance near the midplane beyond @xmath38 = 300 au .",
    "no emission in strongest in model ( gr ) , which has the lowest volatile nitrogen abundances .",
    "thus , detecting no could indicate a depleted volatile nitrogen reservoir , especially if the @xmath1h@xmath2  emission from the source is weak .",
    "unfortunately , because no has an uneven number of electrons ( @xmath78 ground electronic state ) , strong rotational transitions are replaced by a multitude of weaker lines split by @xmath79 doubling and hyperfine structure that is due to the non - zero spin of the nitrogen atom @xcite . as a result , detecting no is extremely difficult .",
    "currently there are no no detections towards protoplanetary disks , though circumstellar no has been detected toward the embedded protostar ngc 1333-iras 4a @xcite and it has been detected in the dense ism @xcite . however , our models predict the no ( @xmath80 ) transition ( 350.68949 ghz ) to be on the order of several hundred mjy for a disk 140 pc away ( figure [ no ] ) .",
    "the strongest emission is in model ( gr ) , with a flux of 437 mjy . for the full alma array",
    "4.6 minutes of integration time would be required to detect the strongest of our simulated no ( @xmath80 ) lines with a 1.4  beam at the 10 sigma level assuming a spectral resolution of 0.3 km / s .",
    "we again note that our models are descriptive of general effects rather than predictive of the overall flux ; however , this flux level suggests that no may be detectable in some systems .",
    "@xmath1h@xmath2  is used as a tracer of the co snow line , since gas phase co destroys @xmath1h@xmath2@xcite .",
    "our models support this interpretation ( figures [ snow ] and [ snowother ] ) .",
    "the decrease in the @xmath1h@xmath2  abundance between @xmath46 au and @xmath61 au in models n and  corresponds with an increase in the co gas phase abundance . in models nh3 and nh3(gr ) the midplane @xmath1h@xmath2  abundance is much lower .",
    "while there is still an increase in the midplane abundance between @xmath81 au and @xmath61 au in these models , the mere presence of strong @xmath1h@xmath2  emission at the co snow line suggests that  is the main nitrogen reservoir .",
    "cn and hcn are widely detected in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ cnhcn ] shows the column density ratio of cn to hcn for our four models . in model",
    "the ratio is much larger than in the other models inside of 5 au due to a decrease in the cn column density . beyond 100",
    "au the column density of hcn in model ( gr ) falls off , resulting in a higher cn / hcn ratio compared to the other models .",
    "the ratio of the simulated cn ( @xmath82 ) and hcn ( 3 - 2 ) line strength is 0.5 for model n. in comparison for most disks with detected cn and hcn emission the ratio is between 1 and 3 @xcite .",
    "our simulated hcn line emission is too strong .",
    "this could be due to the specific dust structure used in this model , underestimating the highly uncertain hcn binding energy , or a missing hcn processing mechanism ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "comets are thought to be indicative of the abundances in the young solar nebula @xcite .",
    "figure [ comets ] shows how the  and  ice abundances in the midplane compare to the observed abundances in comets .",

    "the  shows the range of values detected in comet hale - bopp , comet halley , and comet hyakutake @xcite .",
    "the  ice abundance relative to water is below the upper limit for comet halley in all of our models , with model",
    "n having the highest  to water ratio . though our models are not meant to be analogs for the solar nebula , model n reproduces the ammonia to water ratio observed in comets , while model  is at the upper limit of the observed range .",
    "this suggests either that  is processed into more refractory like material , such as part of chon dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or  ice is not as easily incorporated into ices as the models predict . in this case , at face value , these models suggest n was delivered either as n or .",
    "we have presented four models for the initial nitrogen abundances in protoplanetary disks .",
    "models in which the majority of the initial nitrogen is in gas phase atomic n predict that n , , and  ice are the dominant nitrogen - bearing species at late stages , with a significant fraction of the nitrogen also in hcn ice .",
    "when the initial nitrogen is instead placed in  gas the differences are difficult to differentiate observationally , indicating that the disk is able to convert gas phase n to  efficiently .",
    "when the nitrogen starts as , either in the gas phase or frozen onto grains , the majority of the n remains in  ice .",
    "n best matches the  to h@xmath32o  ratio in comets , suggesting that n was delivered to the solar nebula in a highly volatile form rather than , for example , in ices .    the presence or absence of @xmath1h@xmath2  in the midplane beyond the co snow line indicates whether nitrogen is dominated by  in the midplane , with the presence of @xmath1h@xmath2  correlating with the presence of  gas and inversely correlating with the presence of  ice .",
    "@xmath1h@xmath2  traces the snow line in all four models , though the emission is stronger for models n and .",
    "thus the detection of strong @xmath1h@xmath2  emission with a ring - like distribution suggests a disk with a high  abundance .",
    "in addition , @xmath1h@xmath2  emission can be used to determine the gas phase  abundance in the midplane .",
