    "the weights are derived in the control regions and extrapolated through the signal region to avoid bias from the expected signal .",
    "this uncertainty has a negligible effect on the results , because a large fraction of background events lie in the first few bins of the epd distribution .",
    "small changes in modeling of those background events do not significantly change the shape of the epd .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty due to the @xmath13 mismodeling described above , we consider several other sources of systematic uncertainty , taking into account their effect on both the signal acceptance and the shape of the background and signal templates . the uncertainty on the normalization of the backgrounds is considered part of the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty is due to the jet energy scale ( jes ) uncertainty .",
    "its effect is quantified by varying the jet energies in the simulated samples by @xmath68 .",
    "we assign both an acceptance uncertainty and a shape uncertainty on the signal templates due to the jes .",
    "other sources of systematic uncertainty considered are initial and final state radiation , parton distribution functions , jet energy resolution , the factorization and renormalization scale ( @xmath69 scale ) used in the alpgen @xmath70+jets simulations , and the integrated luminosity .",
    "the observed and predicted epds are shown in figure  [ fig : epd ] .",
    "we use a binned maximum likelihood fit of the observed epd to a sum of templates .",
    "systematic uncertainties are incorporated into the fit as nuisance parameters .",
    "we perform pseudo - experiments to calculate the probability ( @xmath71-value ) that the background - only discriminant fluctuates up to the observed result ( observed @xmath71-value ) and up to the median expected signal plus background result ( expected @xmath71-value ) .",

    "a complimentary search for a resonance in the invariant mass distribution has been carried out by fitting the @xmath13 shape to a sum of signal and background templates .",
    "the background should be smoothly falling while the signal should exhibit a peak at around 80  gev from the hadronic decay of a @xmath10 or @xmath11 boson .",
    "this is a somewhat simpler search technique than using matrix elements as described above , but is not expected to be as sensitive since it does not take advantage of the full event kinematics .",
    "a larger data sample was used for this search , corresponding to 3.9 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the event selection for this search is somewhat different than what has been described for the matrix element analysis .",
    "the central lepton triggers are used , and offline events are required to contain one electron candidate with @xmath75 or one muon candidate with @xmath76 .",
    "we require @xmath77 gev and at least two jets with @xmath3420 gev .",
    "the non-@xmath10 background is reduced by requiring @xmath3730 gev/@xmath78 .",
    "events are rejected if the two jets have @xmath79 .",
    "we also reject events whose hadronic vector boson candidate has @xmath80 gev ; this selection improves the agreement between data and simulation and ensures a smoothly falling shape in the background dijet invariant mass in the expected signal region .    on data",

    "the overall normalization of the ewk contribution is a free parameter in the signal extraction .",
    "the second template is the multi - jet qcd background template ; its normalization is constrained by the fit to the @xmath31 described earlier .",
    "the third template describes the signal and its normalization is a free parameter in the fit .",
    "in addition , the global normalization of the sum of our signal and background models is a free parameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : projections ] shows the data superimposed on the fitted templates after the electron and muon samples are combined .",
    "dijet mass distribution in data superimposed on the predicted background and signal distributions .",
    "]    the systematic uncertainties in the fit to the @xmath13 distribution are treated in a similar way as in the matrix element search . in this case , however , the largest sources of systematic uncertainty are the shape uncertainties of the ewk and multi - jet background templates .",
    "the jet energy scale uncertainty is also significant , as is the overall 6% uncertainty on the integrated luminosity .",
    "we estimate 428 @xmath83 177 ( stat ) @xmath83 56 ( sys ) events in the @xmath84 sample and 650 @xmath83 149 ( stat ) @xmath83 66 ( sys ) events in the @xmath85 sample , giving cross sections of 10.3 @xmath83 4.2 ( stat ) @xmath83 1.7 ( sys ) pb in the electron sample and 19.5 @xmath83 4.7 ( stat ) @xmath83 2.8(sys ) pb in the muon sample . combining the two decays",

    "in summary , we have observed @xmath0 production in the lepton plus two jets final state .",
    "we performed two searches : one building a discriminant using matrix element calculations and the other looking for a resonance on top of a smoothly falling dijet mass distribution .",
