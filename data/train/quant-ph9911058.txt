    ", does it appear that the use of _ exact _ integration methods , such as exploited above , will succeed , and recourse will have to be had to _ numerical _ techniques , such as were advanced in @xcite .",

    "we have determined the corresponding ( conditional ) bures prior , again based on proposition 1 in @xcite .",
    "the probability of separability is the ratio of the integrals of the prior over these two intervals .",
    "this turns out to be .607921  as seems plausible from the plot of the ( conditional ) bures prior over the feasibility range in fig .  [ 3l1 ] .",

    "[ ellipticplot ] ) . for @xmath187 ,",
    "we numerically integrate , as well as plot , the absolute value of the ( imaginary ) bures prior in this part of the parameter range .",
    "the probability of separability also appears to be vanishingly small for the `` hybrid '' qubit - qutrit werner states ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the greatest degree of entanglement one can hope to achieve is to have the qubit in a fully mixed state , and the qutrit in a degenerate state , with spectrum @xmath71 , @xmath71 and 0 .",
    "the range of separability can then be shown to be @xmath188 $ ] @xcite .",
    "( for the analysis of _",
    "multi_-qubit werner states , see @xcite . ) the ( unnormalized ) conditional bures prior ( fig .",

    "we believe the main contribution of this study is that it emphatically reveals  through its remarkably simple results of an exact nature  the existence of an intimate connection between two major ( but , heretofore , rather distinct ) areas of study in quantum physics . by this",
    "is meant the study of : ( 1 ) metric structures on quantum systems @xcite ; and ( 2 ) entanglement of quantum systems ( cf .",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the several _ exact _ bures probabilities of separability adduced above are all for certain qubit - qubit systems ( representable by @xmath0 density matrices ) .",
    "it would be of interest to see if exact results are obtainable for qubit - qutrit ( representable by @xmath1 density matrices ) and even larger - sized systems , as well as for qubit - qubit systems parameterized by more than three variables ( the maximum possible being fifteen ) .",
    "such investigations would , undoubtedly , demand considerable computational resources and sophistication .",
    "( let us also direct the reader s attention to our study @xcite , in which we employ numerical methods to estimate the bures probability of separability of the two - party _ gaussian _ states , forms of continuous variable systems .",
    "for this purpose , we employed an analogue @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of the peres - horodecki criterion for separability @xcite . )",
    "we also intend to use the bures probabilities as weights for the _ entanglement of formation _ @xcite . by doing so",
    ", we should be able to order different scenarios by the total amount of entanglement they involve .",
    "as a first example , we have found this figure to be equal to .0441763 for the first ( one - parameter ) scenario we have analyzed above ( sec .",
    "[ secthreea ] ) , that of three equal intra - directional correlations ( and all other parameters fixed at zero ) .",
    "one of the clearer findings of @xcite was that the bures ( minimal monotone ) probability of separability provides an _ upper _ bound on the related probability for any monotone metric .",
    "so , it would appear that the results reported above might also be interpreted as providing upper bounds on any acceptable measure of the probability of separability .",
    "let us also remark that a quite distinct direction perhaps worthy of exploration is the use of bures priors as densities - of - states or structure functions for thermodynamic purposes ( cf .",
    "( however , our initial efforts to find explicit forms for the partition functions corresponding to the results above have not succeeded . )",
    "i would like to express appreciation to the institute for theoretical physics for computational support in this research , to michael trott of wolfram research for analyzing a number of the symbolic integration problems here with version 4 of mathematica , to k. yczkowski for his continuing encouragement and interest , and to m. j. w. hall for helpful insights into the properties of the bures metric , as applied to lower - dimensional subsets of the @xmath191-dimensional @xmath23 density matrices .",
