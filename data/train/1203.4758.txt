    "pion  nucleon scattering is one of the most basic and fundamental processes in strong - interaction physics .",
    "even though a large data basis exists and numerous investigations based on a cornucopia of methods ( dispersion relations , quark models , resonance models , chiral perturbation theory , just to name a few ) have been performed for many decades , the pion ",
    "nucleon ( @xmath3 ) scattering amplitude is still not known to sufficient precision in the low - energy region .-",
    "wave scattering lengths , which can be extracted with high precision from the beautiful data on pionic hydrogen and pionic deuterium , see  @xcite . ]",
    "this becomes most obvious in the scalar - isoscalar sector , which features the so - called pion ",
    "nucleon @xmath4 term @xmath5 , i.e.  the scalar form factor of the nucleon at zero momentum transfer .",
    "its value is a measure of the light quark contribution to the nucleon mass ( and it can also be related to its strange quark contribution ) , see e.g.  the classical paper  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 term has gained renewed interest as it parameterizes the spin - independent cross section for possible dark matter candidates scattering off nuclei  @xcite ( for a recent review cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in principle",
    ", lattice qcd would be the method of choice to pin down the @xmath4 term  however , a direct computation of the scalar form factor necessarily involves disconnected diagrams , which is not yet under sufficient control .",
    "similarly , the indirect extraction of @xmath5 from the derivative of the nucleon mass is still hampered with systematic uncertainties related to the chiral extrapolations utilized , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we follow a different path , namely setting up the powerful machinery of roy  steiner ( rs ) equations that will ultimately allow for a precise determination of the pion ",
    "nucleon scattering amplitude at low energies .",
    "more specifically , rs equations are based on hyperbolic dispersion relations ( hdrs ) , a particular kind of dispersion relations along hyperbolae in the mandelstam plane .",
    "dispersion relations are a widely used tool that is built upon very general principles , such as lorentz invariance , unitarity , crossing symmetry , and analyticity",
    ". there are multiple uses of dispersion relations  they can be used to stabilize extrapolation of experimental data to threshold and allow for a continuation into unphysical regions , as it is e.g.  required for the extrapolation of the pion ",
    "nucleon scattering amplitude to the so - called cheng ",
    "dashen point  @xcite , which is crucial for the extraction of the @xmath4 term .",
    "we notice that unitarity constraints can most conveniently be formulated in terms of partial - wave amplitudes . the resulting partial - wave dispersion relations ( pwdrs ) together with unitarity constraints allow to study processes at low energies with high precision .",
    "we just mention a few examples .",
    "the most prominent example is of course pion  pion ( @xmath6 ) scattering , which is intimately linked to the spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "the roy equations  @xcite are the appropriate pwdrs , which have been extensively studied in the last years  @xcite , leading to a determination of the fundamental @xmath6 scattering amplitude with unprecedented precision .",
    "the pion  pion system , however , is special as all channels are identical .",
    "this is different for the simplest scattering process in qcd involving strange quarks , namely pion  kaon ( @xmath7 ) scattering , which has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "as far as crossing symmetry and isospin quantum numbers are concerned , the pion  kaon system is similar to the pion ",
    "nucleon case considered here . crossing symmetry relates the @xmath8-/@xmath9-channel ( @xmath10 ) and the @xmath11-channel ( @xmath0 ) amplitudes , with the @xmath8-channel amplitudes relevant e.g.  for @xmath4-term physics , while the @xmath11-channel amplitudes feature prominently in the dispersive analysis of the nucleon form factors .",
    "the final aim of solving the full ( subtracted ) rs system for @xmath3 scattering is a precise determination of the lowest partial - wave amplitudes in the low - energy ( physical and unphysical ) region as well as the pertinent low - energy parameters , such as the @xmath3 coupling constant and the so - called subthreshold parameters , and to provide reliable theoretical errors for the fundamental pion ",
    "nucleon scattering amplitude for the first time .    in the low - energy region , the pion ",
    "nucleon amplitude is well represented by its @xmath12- and @xmath13-wave projections . due to the spin of the nucleon ,",
    "one has in total six partial waves in the @xmath8- and @xmath9-channel , commonly denoted as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where the superscript @xmath17 refers to the isospin , @xmath18 in the subscript to the orbital angular momentum , and the @xmath19 to the total angular momentum @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , there are three @xmath11-channel @xmath12- and @xmath13-waves , called @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where the superscript refers to total angular momentum @xmath23 and the @xmath24 to parallel / antiparallel antinucleon  nucleon helicities , such that there is one wave with even and two with odd isospin ( due to bose symmetry ) .",
    "it was pointed out in  @xcite how to generalize the roy equations for @xmath6 scattering to the @xmath3 system based on fixed-@xmath11 dispersion relations .",
    "these amount to coupled integral equations for the nine partial waves , where the effect of the higher partial waves is encoded in the respective kernels of these integral equations . here ,",
    "we follow a somewhat different path by utilizing hyperbolic dispersion relations as pioneered by hite and steiner a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of hdrs is that they combine the @xmath8- and the @xmath11-channel ( i.e.  all three ) physical regions , which is obviously not true for e.g.  usual fixed-@xmath11 dispersion relations .",
    "it is known that a reliable continuation to the subthreshold region in dispersion theory can only be made by using input information also from the @xmath11-channel , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the knowledge of the absorptive parts in the dispersion relations is needed only in regions where the corresponding partial - wave expansions converge , and hdrs are considered the best choice fulfilling these requirements that yields still manageable angular kernels  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the underlying hyperbolic relation @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 , @xmath27 real - valued parameters ) also respects @xmath28 crossing symmetry of the @xmath3 amplitude .",
    "due to the tunable parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , better convergence properties can be achieved with hdrs and they are found to be especially powerful for determining the @xmath4 term  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the rs equations for the @xmath3 system is given by a series of steps : first , one expands the @xmath8-/@xmath11-channel absorptive parts of the hdrs in @xmath8-/@xmath11-channel partial waves , respectively .",
    "second , one projects the full , partial - wave - expanded hdrs onto both @xmath8- and @xmath11-channel partial waves , resulting in what we will refer to as the @xmath8- and @xmath11-channel part of the rs system in the following .",
    "the resulting system of equations exhibits the following general structure : it features the nucleon - pole - term contributions , integrals over the imaginary parts of the @xmath8-(and @xmath9-)channel as well as integrals over @xmath11-channel absorptive parts , both from the corresponding threshold to infinity .",
    "the generic properties of the equations are then determined by the integral kernels . in the equation for each partial wave , the corresponding kernels consist of the self - coupling , singular cauchy kernel and an analytic remainder that in addition involves the coupling to all other partial waves .",
    "in particular , these kernel functions automatically incorporate the analytic properties expected for a given partial wave : the cauchy kernel corresponds to the right - hand cut , while the remainder contains all left - hand - cut contributions .",
    "another important issue is the possibility to subtract dispersion relations .",
    "this can be advantageous for various reasons : first , in some cases the asymptotic behavior of the integrand is such that subtractions have to be performed to ensure convergence of the dispersive integral .",
    "similarly , if the high - energy behavior is not known , it can be subsumed in subtraction constants , which are a priori unknown . in some cases",
    ", these subtraction constants can be related to phenomenology or the parameters of a low - energy effective field theory like e.g.  chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "second , one can even introduce subtractions that are not necessarily required by the asymptotic behavior in order to lessen the dependence on high - energy input , however , at the expense of introducing the corresponding subtraction polynomials .",
    "third , subtracting the dispersion relations is especially useful in the @xmath3 case , since subtracting at the so - called subthreshold point allows for a relation to the subthreshold expansion and is convenient for the continuation to the cheng  dashen point .",
    "in addition , such subtractions are well suited for the @xmath11-channel problem to be discussed later . in what follows",
    ", we will consider unsubtracted as well as subtracted versions of the rs equations .",
    "scattering.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    next , we will outline the strategy to solve the rs equations , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] : first , one solves the @xmath11-channel part of the rs system , which takes the form of a muskhelishvili  omns ( mo ) problem  @xcite ( using rather well known @xmath8-channel partial waves and @xmath6 phase shifts as input ) .",
    "then , one uses the @xmath11-channel mo solutions to solve the @xmath8-channel part , and finally the procedure is repeated ( iterated ) until self - consistency of the partial waves and parameters is reached and the results have converged , cf .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] . in both the @xmath8- and @xmath11-channel part of the system one actually solves the equations in the low - energy region and for the lowest partial waves , while the amplitudes in the high - energy region as well as higher partial waves are needed as input .",
    "the separation between both energy regions occurs at the so - called matching points @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the @xmath8- and @xmath11-channel , respectively . due to the complexity of the full problem",
    ", we will not yet solve the whole set of rs equations in this article , but concentrate on the @xmath11-channel part of the system as a first step .",
    "the solution of this @xmath11-channel subproblem is interesting by itself , as it features in the dispersive analysis of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors as well as the scalar form factor , which is , in turn , essential for the extraction of the @xmath4 term . at present , in the unphysical region only the kh80 solution  @xcite has been used .",
    "it is , however , well - known that this solution does not include more recent and precise data and that the @xmath3 coupling constant used there differs significantly from more modern determinations .",
    "furthermore , no analysis of the theoretical uncertainties is performed ( apart from an iteration uncertainty , cf .",
    "[ subsubsec : pinmo : input : expwa ] ) , which is an absolute requirement for any modern theoretical investigation .",
    "therefore , a new @xmath11-channel solution is needed as a first step for solving the full system .",
    "finally , a consistent set of partial - wave amplitudes for all channels is especially important as far as the @xmath4-term extraction is concerned , and it has been pointed out that the kh80 solution seems to suffer from internal inconsistencies  @xcite , which emphasizes the necessity of a full system of pwdrs .",
    "the original roy equations for @xmath6 scattering  @xcite were solely based on fixed-@xmath11 dispersion relations .",
    "this approach fails for processes involving non - identical particles , since crossing symmetry intertwines different physical processes . for this reason ,",
    "a combination of fixed-@xmath11 and hyperbolic dispersion relations was used in  @xcite to construct integral equations for @xmath7 scattering for the partial waves of both @xmath8- and @xmath11-channel , which are therefore referred to as roy  steiner equations . in this work ,",
    "we solely consider hdrs , a path that has already proven useful in the construction of rs equations for @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "our solution strategy for the @xmath11-channel mo equations follows  @xcite , however , there is a major difference between @xmath32 and @xmath0 as far as inelasticities in the unitarity relation are concerned , since the pseudophysical region in the @xmath3 case is much larger due to the large nucleon mass . in both cases , the first non - negligible contribution besides @xmath6 intermediate states originate from @xmath33 , which play an important role for the @xmath12-wave in view of the occurrence of the @xmath34 resonance . for @xmath32 the inelasticities",
    "can simply be accounted for by using phase - shift solutions for the corresponding partial waves , while physical input for @xmath0 is only available above the two - nucleon threshold .",
    "once the @xmath11-channel problem is solved , the remaining equations take the form of the conventional @xmath6 roy equations , such that known results concerning existence and uniqueness of solutions  @xcite may be transferred to the @xmath8-channel rs equations as well .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sect .  [",
    "sec : preliminaries ] we specify our conventions and review hdrs for the invariant amplitudes of @xmath3 scattering . in sects .",
    "[ sec : rs ] and [ sec : subrs ] we derive a closed system of rs equations as well as a once- and twice - subtracted version , and show how the @xmath11-channel equations can be cast into the form of a mo problem .",
