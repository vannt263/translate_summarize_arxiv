    "the search for the qcd critical point has attracted considerable theoretical and experimental attention recently .",
    "the existence of such a point  an ending point of the first order chiral transition in qcd  was suggested a long time ago @xcite , and the properties were studied using universality arguments and model calculations more recently @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) . the experimental search for the critical point using heavy ion collisions has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that theoretical knowledge of the location of the critical point on the phase diagram is important for the success of the experimental search .",
    "first principle lattice qcd calculations aimed at determining the location of the critical point on the @xmath1 ( temperature , baryon - chemical potential ) diagram have been attempted recently using several different techniques @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for review ) .",
    "the major obstacle for direct monte carlo simulation is the well - known lack of positivity of the measure of the path integral defining qcd partition function at nonzero baryo - chemical potential @xmath0  the sign problem .",
    "one of the methods to deal with this problem is to taylor expand the qcd pressure in powers of @xmath0 around @xmath2 , i.e. , around the point at which direct monte carlo simulations are not hindered by the sign problem @xcite .",
    "the success of such an approach in determining the location @xmath3 of the critical ending point crucially depends on the convergence radius of the taylor expansion around @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the convergence radius , in turn , is a function of the position of the singularities in the complex @xmath0 plane .",
    "little is known about the location of these singularities to date .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to expand our knowledge of the location of these complex plane singularities",
    ".    we shall be able to determine the position of the singularities in the regime where the quark masses @xmath4 are sufficiently small .",
    "to summarize , the strongest rigorous consequence of our analysis is that the convergence radius , @xmath5 , achieves its minimum value at a temperature slightly above @xmath6 ( by @xmath7 ) .",
    "this value scales as @xmath8 and vanishes in the chiral limit ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the value @xmath10 is determined by the critical exponents of the o(4 ) universality class in 3 dimensions .",
    "the singularity which determines the radius in lies in the complex plane and pinches the real axis ( together with its conjugate ) at the critical point .",
    "the convergence radius @xmath11 has a certain nonanalyticity at @xmath12 , which we shall describe .",
    "the study of thermodynamic singularities , or partition function zeros , in the complex plane was pioneered by yang and lee @xcite .",
    "their analysis was extended by fisher from the complex magnetic field singularities to complex temperature singularities @xcite .",
    "the properties of these singularities following from scaling and universality have been further studied by fisher @xcite , itzykson , pearson and zuber @xcite and others .",
    "from the point of view of the lattice studies of the qcd phase diagram , we would like to distinguish two separate issues .",
    "one is the convergence of the series as the truncation order is increased .",
    "this is the issue which this study will impact .",
    "the other is the convergence of each term in the series to its thermodynamic limit as the volume and/or the number of monte carlo configurations are increased .",
    "the sign - problem is affecting this latter convergence and will not be addressed here ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we describe generic universal properties of the complex thermodynamic singularities .",
    "the basic results following from scaling and universality are not new , and can be found in @xcite . for clarity and completeness ,",
    "we rederive the needed facts here using slightly different approach .",
    "our purpose is to apply these results to qcd at finite temperature and density .",
    "we shall first consider qcd in the chiral limit ",
    "the limit of two lightest quark masses taken to zero .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath14 plane is sketched in figure  [ fig : pd - sketch ] .",
    "the low - temperature phase is separated from the high - temperature phase by a phase transition .",
    "this is unavoidable , because the symmetry of the ground state must change from su(2)@xmath15u(1)@xmath16 to the full symmetry of the action su(2)@xmath15su(2)@xmath17u(1)@xmath16 as the temperature is raised @xcite .",
    "this transition is of second order for @xmath18 , and of first order for @xmath19 .",
    "let us now fix @xmath20 at a value in the interval @xmath21 and study the behavior of singularities in the complex @xmath0 plane . on the real axis , as @xmath0 increases from zero ,",
    "the transition occurs at a value which we denote as @xmath22 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pd - sketch ] ) .",
    "therefore , at a fixed temperature , the change of the chemical potential @xmath23 is a relevant perturbation . in the universality class of the o(3)@xmath24o(4 ) transitions , to which qcd chiral restoration transition belongs @xcite , there is only one relevant variable  the thermal variable @xmath25 ( we are discussing the symmetry limit  the magnetic field variable @xmath26 is absent ) . therefore , we are led to consider the universal behavior of the singularities in the complex _ temperature _ plane , which correspond to fisher zeros .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath25 is to linear order @xmath27 we use @xmath28 instead of @xmath13 to ensure that at @xmath29 the thermal variable is proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "as first exposed by lee and yang @xcite , the thermodynamic singularities in the complex plane are related to the zeros of the partition function . for a finite system",
    "the partition function @xmath31 , by definition , is strictly positive for _ real _ values of the parameters .",
    "however , @xmath31 has zeros in the complex plane , whose number grows linearly with the size of the system . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the zeros typically coalesce into cuts .",
    "a phase transition occurs where such a cut pinches ( second order ) or crosses ( first order ) the real axis .",
    "the considerations of lee and yang apply to the variable @xmath32 since the partition function of qcd is a polynomial in this variable due to quantization of the baryon charge .",
    "it is convenient to use the electrostatic analogy .",
    "the partition function  a polynomial , can be written in terms of its roots @xmath33 therefore the free energy ( or grand potential , if we are dealing with grand canonical ensemble , as in qcd ) is @xmath34 for complex @xmath35 , the real part @xmath36 can be interpreted as an electrostatic potential created by charges located on the plane @xmath37 : @xmath38 all charges have the same magnitude and sign ( degenerate roots can be treated as coincident charges ) .",
    "now let us assume , as is known to be true in most cases , and in the universality region of interest in particular , that the zeros coalesce into 1-dimensional curves in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "then , the electrostatic potential @xmath36 is continuous across such a curve , while the analog of the electric field @xmath39 is discontinuous  the normal component jumps by an amount proportional to the linear charge density @xmath40 on the curve .",
    "this curve can be viewed as the location of a cut on a riemann sheet of the analytic function @xmath41 .",
    "consider now the critical region in the vicinity of a critical point @xmath43 .",
    "in the scaling regime the singular ( i.e. , non - analytic ) part of the potential @xmath44 is proportional to a power of @xmath25:@xmath45 which defines the universal specific heat exponent @xmath46 and the amplitudes @xmath47 , whose ratio is also universal . off the real axis @xmath44",
    "must be an analytic function everywhere except for discontinuities across the cuts .",
    "such cuts ( at least two , by symmetry @xmath48 ) must be present , because the function taken at @xmath49 does not match its analytic continuation from the @xmath50 axis along a path around @xmath51 .",
    "the location of the cuts can be determined using electrostatic analogy , which requires @xmath36 to be continuous across the cut .",
    "parameterizing @xmath52 using real parameter @xmath53 we find : @xmath54 = a_-\\cos[(2-\\alpha)\\varphi].\\ ] ] therefore , the cuts are straight lines at an angle with respect to the negative @xmath25 axis given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath55 = \\frac{\\cos(\\pi\\alpha)-a_-/a_+}{\\sin(\\pi\\alpha)}\\,,\\ ] ] as shown in figure  [ fig : scalingzeros ] .",
    "all quantities entering this formula are universal .",
    "the cuts are termed stokes boundaries in @xcite  they carry conceptual resemblance to the anti - stokes lines in the wkb theory . across these lines ,",
    "the function @xmath56 switches from one of its riemann sheets to another .",
    "the density of the `` charges '' on the cut is proportional to the discontinuity of the normal component of @xmath57 , and thus to @xmath58 , which vanishes at the branching point as @xmath59      the magnetic field @xmath26 is another relevant variable near the o(4 ) critical point .",
    "the magnetic field breaks the o(4 ) down to o(3 ) , and in qcd this role is played by the quark mass @xmath4 ( more precisely , the average of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 masses ) . at @xmath63 the free energy is analytic function of @xmath25 at @xmath51 . in the scaling region",
    "the singular part of the free energy scales as a power of @xmath26 if @xmath25 is also changed to keep the scaling variable @xmath64 fixed . therefore the ( two ) branching points must be located at a point away from the origin given by @xmath65 and at @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a complex constant .",
    "the phase of @xmath68 ( the polar angle coordinate of the branching point ) is determined by the following argument . by scaling postulate ,",
    "the singular contribution to the free energy must be given by @xmath69 where the function @xmath70 is analytic at @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath70 has two cuts which originate at points @xmath67 and @xmath72 and go off to infinity . consider @xmath73 as a function of _ complex _ @xmath26 at fixed real  @xmath25 . by symmetry ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 )",
    ", the stokes boundaries of this function lie on the imaginary axis ( more rigorously , this follows from the lee - yang theorem and universality ) .",
    "thus the branching point , for @xmath49 , at @xmath76 , is purely imaginary , and therefore @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath78    to summarize , at @xmath42 , the complex singularities in the scaling region of the thermal parameter @xmath25 form cuts ( stokes boundaries ) which go along the rays at angle @xmath79 with the negative real axis given by . with increasing symmetry breaking parameter @xmath26 the branching point shifts away from @xmath51 by an amount proportional to @xmath80 along the direction at the angle @xmath81 to the positive @xmath25 axis given by .",

    "the initial direction of the cuts near this point is perpendicular to the real axis , i.e. , @xmath108 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the perturbation @xmath109 is magnetic - field - like , @xmath110 and from the fact that singularities in the @xmath26 plane lie on the imaginary axis .",
    "the reason that @xmath109 is not @xmath25-like , but @xmath26-like , is the following . in the vicinity of the critical point , since the o(4 ) is explicitly broken , the perturbation @xmath109 affects both the thermal variable @xmath25 as well as magnetic - field - like variable @xmath26 to linear order . since @xmath111 , the scaling variable @xmath112 is small , which means the perturbation @xmath109 takes the system into the region where the variable @xmath26 dominates the scaling . and @xmath113 .",
