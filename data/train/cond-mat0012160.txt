    "in the macroscopic limit , a system described by the reduced bcs hamiltonian is well treated by the mean field bcs method @xcite . when the size of a superconducting sample becomes small",
    ", two related questions can be asked : what is the lower size limit for which superconducting properties are observable , and what is the lower size limit for the validity of the bcs theory ?    in 1959",
    "anderson @xcite considered the first question , and argued that `` superconductivity would no longer be possible '' once the electron spectrum s mean level spacing , @xmath0 , becomes larger than the bulk superconducting gap , @xmath1 .",
    "( @xmath10 , the density of states per spin species near the fermi energy , hence @xmath11 . )",
    "this statement sets a lower limit for the size above which a grain still exhibits superconducting properties , but at the same time states that such a grain can well be much smaller than the superconducting coherence length .",
    "superconductors in the regime where the level spacing is comparable to the gap energy have been studied for many years both theoretically ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and experimentally ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , see also review by perenboom _ et .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently , ralph , black and tinkham ( rbt ) performed measurements on single superconducting nm - scale grains in the regimes of @xmath2 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these experiments , and the considerable amount of theoretical work they initiated @xcite , found various properties indicative of strong superconducting pairing correlations in grains with @xmath13 ( to be called `` small grains '' ) , but not in grains with @xmath14 ( to be called `` ultrasmall grains '' ) , thus supporting anderson s criterion .",
    "these properties include ( i ) a parity dependent gap in the excitation spectrum ( the gap exists only for grains with an even number of electrons ) , which is driven to zero by magnetic field @xcite ; ( ii ) a difference of order @xmath1 in the ground state energies of even and odd grains @xcite ; and ( iii ) a first order paramagnetic transition induced by a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "though _ ultra_small grains with @xmath14 do not have as strongly developed signatures of pairing correlations as the small grains with @xmath13 mentioned above , pairing correlations nevertheless do exist in such grains , albeit in the form of weaker fluctuations , and they can affect various physical quantities .",
    "for example , di lorenzo _ et .",
    "_ @xcite find that pairing correlations affect the temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility of grains also in the ultrasmall regime .",
    "the crossover regime between small and ultrasmall grains has also been studied in some detail numerically , using a simple reduced bcs model with a discrete set of single - particle levels .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", it was found that the condensation energy , @xmath15 ( i.e. the energy gain of the exact ground state relative to the uncorrelated fermi ground state ) , smoothly crosses over from being extensive ( proportional to the size of the system ) for @xmath7 to being intensive for @xmath16 .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper is to obtain further insights into the crossover from the ultrasmall regime , which can be treated perturbatively in the dimensionless coupling ( @xmath5 ) of the said reduced bcs model , to the small regime , which can not .",
    "our point of departure is an exact solution , due to richardson @xcite , of the reduced bcs model of present interest . by analyzing richardson s solution both analytically and numerically in the crossover regime , we elucidate in detail when and how perturbation theory in @xmath5 breaks down , how the answer depends on the system size , and how the standard bcs results are recovered in the bulk limit @xmath17 .",
    "the bulk regime is of course well - known to require a nonperturbative treatment ; indeed , the bcs result for the condensation energy , @xmath18 is not analytical in @xmath5 as @xmath19 , since the bulk gap is given by @xmath20}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the bandwidth about the fermi energy within which the pairing interaction acts ( typically the debye frequency ) .",
    "this nonanalyticity arises because bcs consider the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , at fixed @xmath24 ) .",
    "we shall argue that if instead one considers a system with a finite number of pairs , say @xmath4 , the condensation energy @xmath25 is an analytical function about @xmath26 , with a finite radius of convergence given approximately by @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 , corresponding to @xmath14 ( by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bulkgap ] ) @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath25 is found to be well approximated by the perturbative result , @xmath29 on the other hand , the bcs mean - field result , @xmath30 of ( [ eq : econdbcs ] ) , is found to become reliable only for @xmath31 , corresponding to roughly @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we identify a substantial intermediate regime , @xmath33 in which neither the perturbative result nor the bcs mean - field result adequately reproduces @xmath15 ( though , roughly speaking , the sum @xmath34 does ) .",
    "the existence of this intermediate regime , which to the best of our knowledge has not been identified before , implies that the regime of validity of the bcs mean - field approach for calculating @xmath15 is significantly smaller than realized hitherto : the crossover level spacing ( @xmath35 beyond which it becomes inadequate is considerably smaller than the scale @xmath36 beyond which the bcs approach formally breaks down ( in the sense of yielding no non - trivial solution to the self - consistency equation @xcite ) , and up to which strong signatures for pairing correlations can still be observed , as mentioned above .",
    "we are also able to pinpoint the reason for the failure of the bcs approach in the intermediate regime ( [ eq : regimeii ] ) : we shall show in detail that @xmath30 incorporates only contributions to @xmath15 from the strongly pair - correlated , `` condensed '' levels within @xmath1 of the fermi energy @xmath37 , but neglects contributions from all the remaining , `` weakly pair - fluctuating '' levels , which extend to a distance @xmath24 from @xmath37 .",
    "although the latter levels are so weakly correlated that their contribution can be calculated perturbatively , essentially yielding @xmath38 , this contribution turns out to be larger than @xmath30 as long as @xmath39 , and is not negligible compared to the @xmath30 in the whole intermediate regime ( [ eq : regimeii ] ) .",
    "[ note though , that @xmath40 would largely cancel out when one considers energy differences between eigenstates that differ only in the specific placement of a small number of electrons in levels near @xmath37 .",
    "an example would be the ground state energy difference between an even and odd superconducting grain , for which the bcs approach would be adequate in the intermediate regime . ]",
    "it should be mentioned here that the question of how to recover the bcs gap equation from richardson s exact solution has been solved by richardson himself @xcite , by effectively doing a @xmath9 expansion around the bulk , thermodynamic limit .",
    "our work differs from his in that we do an expansion in @xmath5 around the ultrasmall limit for a system of finite size , with @xmath41 as small parameter .    using the insights gained from our studies of the condensation energy ,",
    "we also calculate various other thermodynamic properties of ultrasmall grains at zero temperature , using a controlled analytical approximation with @xmath42 as small parameter .",
    "specifically , we calculate the spin magnetization and susceptibility curves and tunneling peak spectrum of ultrasmall grains , and find that pairing correlations have their signature in all the above physical quantities , even in the regime @xmath43 where pairing correlations are weakest",
    ".    the condensation energy can , in principle , be measured by integrating the spin magnetization as a function of magnetic field ( h ) and comparing it to the linear curve of a normal grain .",
    "in fact , as we discuss in sec .  [ secmagnetization ] , since the energy levels in the grain are not equally ( or systematically ) spaced , one needs to do the measurement on an ensemble of grains . calculating the spin susceptibility of an ultrasmall grain",
    ", we find that for @xmath44 , pairing fluctuations of levels far away from @xmath37 result in a correction of order @xmath45 to the normal susceptibility .",
    "interestingly , this correction persists for all fields @xmath46 , i.e.  well beyond the clogston - chandrashekar field @xmath47 @xcite , at which , for bulk systems , a first order transition occurs from the superconducting ground state to a paramagnetic ground state .",
    "( only for @xmath48 , the grain becomes effectively `` normal '' , since then all the levels within @xmath24 from the fermi energy become unpaired . ) the correction to the spin susceptibility results in a re - entrant behavior of the differential susceptibility as a function of magnetic field , which could possibly serve as a sensitive probe to detect superconducting correlations in ultrasmall grains @xcite .",

    "similarly , we argue below that in ultrasmall superconducting grains , pairing fluctuations involving levels far away from @xmath37 are sufficiently strong that they also leave their mark in the specific heat ( even for @xmath50 ) , and in the tunneling peak spectrum .",

    "the many body eigenstates of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can therefore be classified into different subspaces according to their value of the @xmath65 s , i.e. , according to the configuration of levels within @xmath58 which are occupied by one electron only .",
    "the many body eigenstates and the eigenenergies of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are then found separately @xcite for each of the above subspaces .",
    "the electrons in the singly occupied levels are not scattered to other levels by the interaction term , and the singly occupied levels are `` blocked '' to pair scattering , and we therefore designate them by @xmath66 .",
