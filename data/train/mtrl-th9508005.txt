    "the origin of ferroelectricity in the two well known ferroelectric systems , linbo@xmath2 and litao@xmath2 , has been subject to intense study since the discovery of linbo@xmath0 in 1949 @xcite .",
    "they have many applications in optical , electro - optical and piezoelectric devices , but the fundamental physics that leads to their ferroelectric behavior have not been studied .",
    "their transition temperatures , which are among the highest known ferroelectric transition temperatures , are quite different , 1480 k for linbo@xmath0 and 950 k for litao@xmath0 . the electronic origin of their different @xmath3 is a mystery since nb@xmath4 and ta@xmath4 behave very similarly , and structurely these materials are almost identical .",
    "the origin of their ferroelectric instability as well as their different transition temperatures is investigated .",
    "both materials undergo only one structural phase transition .",
    "the paraelectric structure has a 10 atom unit cell and the average structure belongs to the r@xmath5c space group , the atomic arrangement consists of oxygen octahedra sharing faces along the polar trigonal axis .",
    "the transition metal atoms occupy the centers of oxygen octahedra , and the average li atom position lies on the face between two adjacent oxygen octahedra ( fig . [ structure]a ) .",
    "the ferroelectric structure is rhombohedral , and belongs to the space group r3c .",
    "the transition metal atom is displaced from the center of the oxygen octahedra along the trigonal axis .",
    "the next oxygen octahedron along this axis is empty and the adjacent octahedron has a li atom ferroelectrically displaced from the oxygen face in the spontaneous polarization p@xmath6 direction ( fig .",
    "[ structure]b ) .",
    "glass in 1968 and later johnston _ et al .",
    "_ have determined , using dielectric and thermal measurements , that the phase transformation in these systems is continuous @xcite .    whether the transition is displacive or order - disorder has been much discussed and confusion abounds .",
    "a displacive phase transition is one where the local potential in the mean field of the rest of the crystal has a single minima , and is characterized by a temperature dependent optic mode approaching zero as the temperature reaches t@xmath7 .",
    "temperature dependence measurements of raman , rayleigh scattering @xcite and infrared reflectivity @xcite show soft mode behavior for one polar a@xmath8 ( to ) optic mode in the ferroelectric phase .",
    "this soft mode crosses many e modes ( whose eigenvectors give ionic displacements perpendicular to the polar axis ) , and thus this specific mode is difficult to trace in detail .",
    "tomeno and matsumura @xcite measured the dielectric constants of litao@xmath0 and found a large curie constant , and interpreted their results as indicative of a displacive transition .",
    "evidence for the transition having an order - disorder character came from penna _",
    "@xcite , who observed no mode softening for litao@xmath0 for the a@xmath9 ( to ) mode , followed by chowdhury _",
    "@xcite who performed neutron scattering experiments on linbo@xmath2 , and also failed to observe any softening of the a@xmath9 mode .",
    "@xcite used raman scattering to study linbo@xmath2 between room temperature and 1225k and saw two of the three a@xmath9 modes ( which are , at room temperature , to , lo and to at 250 , 270 and 274 @xmath10 , respectively ) , and observed anomalous behavior for one of them ( at 274 @xmath10 ) as the temperature reached t@xmath11 .",
    "they noted that the decrease in the peak frequency was mostly due to the rapid increase in damping as the linewidth had a divergent form in temperature , whereas the quasiharmonic frequency remained almost temperature - independent .",
    "their conclusion was therefore that linbo@xmath2 does not exhibit a typical displacive transition , but rather resembles an order - disorder system .",
    "@xcite reported these measurements on litao@xmath2 , and found the same kind of behavior . in an order - disorder phase transition the local potential is characterized by a double ( or more ) well , with the thermal energy @xmath12 much smaller then the well depth and no soft phonon mode exist since phonons now oscillate within each well and the wells remain essentially unchanged throughout the phase transition .",
    "these transitions are characterized by a diffusive soft mode which is not a phonon but represent large amplitude thermal hopping between the wells . at t above",
    "@xmath3 the crystal is non - polar in a thermally averaged sense .",
    "jayaraman _ et al . _ @xcite argued for an order - disorder type transition because they saw little pressure dependence of the raman mode ; they also emphasize the difference from ferroelectric perovskites , which show a strong pressure dependence .",
    "raptis @xcite measured and analyzed raman modes of litao@xmath2 between room temperature and 1200k and observed softening of this a@xmath9 mode ( along with others ) to a certain degree .",
    "however , the decrease was characterized with an order - disorder model .",
    "@xcite used perturbed - angular - correlation ( pac ) spectroscopy to measure nuclei - electric - quadrupole interactions at the li sites over a temperature range of 295 - 1100k , and cheng _ et al . _",
    "f@xcite studied inelastic neutron scattering from room temperature up to 800@xmath13 ( 1100 k ) in litao@xmath2 ; both failed to observe mode softening , therefore not supporting the displacive picture for the phase transition .",
    "@xcite used hyper - raman and raman spectra of litao@xmath0 between 14 and 1200 k. no evidence was found for the softening of the @xmath14 mode ; however , a strong debye - type relaxational mode was found in the two phases , suggesting an order - disorder type transition .",
    "they interpreted the anomalous line shape of an @xmath14 mode in terms of coupling with relaxational modes .",
    "most ferroelectric systems are thought of as exhibiting displacive behavior far from the transition temperature region and order - disorder characteristics near t@xmath1 . in the li(nb , ta)o@xmath2 systems this conclusion is supported by a number of studies @xcite .    in other ferroelectric oxides ,",
    "like the perovskites ktao@xmath0 and knbo@xmath0 , the mechanism behind the phase transition has also been debated .",
    "evidence for the transition being of the displacive type are presented by nunes _",
    "_ @xcite and samara @xcite , while comes _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and pac experiments by dougherty _",
    "@xcite point to it being of the order - disorder type .",
    "@xcite have studied raman scattering of knbo@xmath0 and batio@xmath0 and discovered central peaks which have line shapes and thermal dependence characteristics of debye relaxation modes as well as symmetry properties consistent with the eight - site model .",
    "a theoretical study by edwardson of knbo@xmath0 @xcite , using interacting polarizable ions in static and dynamic simulations found a mixture of order - disorder and displacive type behavior .",
    "_ @xcite carried out an lmto study examining the total energy of knbo@xmath0 in the tetragonal and rhombohedral phases .",
    "these calculations found that displacing the nb atom along the @xmath15100@xmath16 direction from its tetragonal cell position corresponds to a saddle point on the total energy surface .",
    "this becomes a minima when the lattice strain is included .",
    "they have also carried out total energy calculations for ktao@xmath0 which found no ferroelectric instability for the calculated volume .",
    "they were able to induce a phase transition by applying negative pressure ( expanding the lattice ) .",
    "an xafs study of ktn by hanske - petitpierre _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that the ferroelectric transition is not displacive and involves orientational order - disorder transition of the nb atom .",
    "a recent first principles investigation of eight perovskites @xcite suggests that in materials like knbo@xmath0 and batio@xmath0 , which are rhombohedral at t=0 , the sequence of successive transitions is explained via the eight site model , where the order parameter in the paraelectric phase fluctuates between the eight minima in the [ 111 ] directions .",
    "these sites are minima at the cubic phase , before the development of the strain .",
    "the theories developed thus far for the litao@xmath0 and linbo@xmath0 systems usually are based on the lines model @xcite .",
    "m. e. lines applied his effective - field theory to litao@xmath2 , and parametrized it as a displacive ferroelectric due to the data available at the time by johnston and kaminow @xcite , and assumed a triple well potential for the li atoms .",
    "@xcite performed neutron scattering of litao@xmath2 between room temperature and 940  k , and discovered that , above t@xmath1 , the lithium atom positions in litao@xmath2 become disordered and hop among the centrosymmetric position and sites at @xmath17 0.37     along the optic axis .",
    "similar measurements for linbo@xmath2 show the same kind of behavior @xcite .",
    "the neutron scattering data is the cornerstone behind all theories modeling this ferroelectric transition as an order - disorder mechanism with the li ions hopping among the centrosymmetric sites and the adjacent octahedral sites .",
    "this approach was adopted by birnie @xcite , who modeled the li hopping as a frenkel defect , and later by bakker _",
    "@xcite , who used this data in addition to the triple well lines model as a basis for a quantum - mechanical description of the phase transformation in litao@xmath2 .",
    "_ predicted and observed @xcite a 32 @xmath10 excitation which they ascribed to li motions between the central and lowest wells .",
    "this excitation frequency has not been observed in other studies , however @xcite .",
    "the kohn - sham equations @xcite are solved self - consistently using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method @xcite , where the electronic many - body exchange - correlation interactions are described by the local density approximation ( lda ) using hedin - lundqvist parametrization @xcite .",
    "there are no shape approximations for the charge density or the potential .",
    "this method has proved predictive in many previous studies .",
    "examples include the prediction of a high pressure phase transformation in silica @xcite , studies of iron at high pressures @xcite studies of al@xmath18o@xmath0 @xcite , mgo and cao @xcite , mgsio@xmath0 @xcite and high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "this method was previously applied successfully to perovskite ferroelectrics like batio@xmath0 , pbtio@xmath0 @xcite and knbo@xmath0 @xcite",
    ".    we use the lapw+lo method @xcite which uses a mixed basis consisting of the lapw basis plus extra localized orbitals inside the muffin tin spheres .",
    "the extra local orbitals remove a li s ghost state and relax the valence states .",
    "it also allows the use of a single energy window .",
    "local orbitals included s for li , _ s _ and _ p _ for o and _ s _ , _ p _ and _ d _ for the nb and ta atoms .",
    "other details of the calculations include a muffin tin size of 1.6 bohr for the li and 2.0 bohr for the nb and ta atoms .",
    "the oxygen s muffin tin radius was 1.6 bohr for oxygen - nb separation up to 1.882   ( 3.556 bohr ) .",
    "the corresponding distance in litao@xmath2 is o - ta up to 1.8845   ( 3.562 bohr ) . at this point",
    "the oxygen muffin tin radius was decreased to 1.552 bohr . for smaller separations",
    "the muffin tin radius was 1.506 bohr . in order to be able to compare the energies calculated using different muffin tin radii",
    ", we have repeated calculations with the three sets of muffin tin radii to find the energy shift due to this change in the muffin tin radii , and have assumed that this small shift ( @xmath19 7 mry ) is constant for small displacements of atoms .",
    "a 4x4x4 special k - point mesh was used which generates a total of 10 k - points in the irreducible zone . to test energy convergence ,",
    "the energies at the symmetric and experimental structures of both litao@xmath2 and linbo@xmath0 were also calculated with a 6x6x6 mesh which generates 28 k - points in the irreducible zone , and these energies are shown in table [ ene ] . the change in energy difference for the two k - point sets between the experimental and the symmetric configurations is 0.069 mry for linbo@xmath0 and 0.3 mry for litao@xmath0 , demonstrating convergence .",
    "the rk@xmath20 parameter was set to 7.0 which gives approximately 1150 basis functions for the litao@xmath2 calculations and 1050 functions for linbo@xmath2 .",
    "the core states were calculated fully relativistically and the valence states semi - relativistically . for each ta atom , the states up to 4f were included in the core , and as a result 0.588 electrons extended beyond the muffin tin sphere . for each nb atom states",
    "up to 4s were included in the core and only 0.07 core electrons extended beyond the sphere ; core electrons that spill out of the muffin tins see an extrapolated spherical core potential .",
    "also , in linbo@xmath0 the li atom s states were included as bands , whereas in litao@xmath0 they were treated as core states .",
    "we have calculated the potential energy surfaces along the experimental soft mode coordinate . to test the sensitivity to the different lattice parameters ,",
    "the total energy of linbo@xmath2 was calculated in the ferroelectric configuration using both the linbo@xmath2 lattice parameters ( a@xmath21=5.14829   and c@xmath21=13.8631  ) @xcite , and the litao@xmath0 lattice parameters ( a@xmath21=5.15428    and c@xmath21=13.78351   ) @xcite , a difference of 0.75% in the c / a ratio .",
    "the effect of this strain on the total energies was almost negligible ; slightly less then 1 mry or 5.5% of the well depth .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the perovskites ; e.g. pbtio@xmath2 , where a strong dependence of the total energy on the tetragonal strain was observed , and the energy decreases markedly , about 35% of the well depth for the experimental 6% c / a strain @xcite . also the total energy of linbo@xmath0 using both the experimental linbo@xmath2 atomic positions ( li at ( 0.2829,0.2829,0.2829 ) , nb at ( 0,0,0 ) and oxygen at ( 0.1139,0.3601,-0.2799 ) ) @xcite and the litao@xmath0 atomic positions ( li at ( 0.279,0.279,0.279 ) , ta at ( 0,0,0 ) and oxygen at ( 0.1188,0.3622,-0.2749 ) @xcite ) were calculated .",
    "the resulting wells are less then 1 mry different , the linbo@xmath0 atomic positions yielding the deeper well . for the purpose of comparison , except for a few more points which yielded the same results ( energy differences of less then 1 mry ) ,",
    "all points were calculated using the experimental lattice parameters and positions of litao@xmath0 to facilitate comparison of the effects of chemistry on ferroelectric behavior and electronic structure .",
    "table [ ene ] summarizes the results for litao@xmath2 and linbo@xmath2 .",
    "the first column refers to the displaced atoms , and to the amount of displacement as a fraction of the paraelectric to experimental ferroelectric normal mode amplitude .",
    "note that one distortion of litao@xmath0 published earlier @xcite was not along the soft mode coordinate ; the present results correct this error .",
    "figure [ energy]a shows the potential energy surfaces of litao@xmath2 with respect to displacements of li only ( upper curves ) , oxygen only ( middle , shallow double wells ) and li+o ( lower curves ) . figure [ energy]b shows the same picture for linbo@xmath0 . the lithium displacements along the soft mode coordinate result in a single anharmonic well with low curvature . displacing only the oxygens against the transition metal atoms results in shallow double wells , and the deep double wells are the result of the li+o displacements along the experimental ferroelectric coordinate .",
    "the wells resulting from the oxygen and lithium displacements have well depths of 17.3 mry ( 2739 k ) and 18.3 mry ( 2858 k ) for litao@xmath2 and linbo@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "both wells are much deeper than the experimental transition temperatures , which is consistent with an order - disorder character for the phase transition .",
    "the energy was fit to a fourth order polynomial in normal mode amplitude , @xmath22 .",
    "the schrdinger equation was solved numerically to obtain the eigenstates assuming one - dimensional non - interacting anharmonic oscillators along the soft - mode coordinate .",
    "figure [ levels ] shows the energy surface as a function of the normal mode amplitude , q , and the energy levels .",
    "we can see that the two wells have a different shape due to the factor of about two in mass of nb and ta , and thus the nb approximately displaces twice as much as the ta relative to the center of mass , which results in a different normal mode amplitude q. the energy difference between the ground and lowest excited state gives a frequency for litao@xmath2 of 270 @xmath10 in fairly good agreement with the experimental raman frequency of 201 - 225 @xmath10 considering the one dimensional noninteracting oscillators approximation . for linbo@xmath2 ,",
    "the calculated frequency is 250 @xmath10 , in excellent agreement with experimental data of about 250 - 275 @xmath10 .",
    "these results indicate that these structural phase transitions are _ not _ dominated energetically by the displacements of the lithium alone .",
    "the potential energy surfaces show that the deep double wells are the result of the _ coupled _ motion of lithiums and oxygens .",
    "displacement of the lithiums alone hardly changes the energy of the system .",
    "this is in contrast to current theories which model the displacement of the lithiums as the driving mechanism for the ferroelectric instability .    in order to understand the oxygen - lithium coupling , we calculated the dynamical matrices for the lapw and madelung energies ( assuming fully charged ions ) for both materials .",
    "the lapw and madelung energies were fitted to a 4th order polynomial surfaces in the normal mode coordinates of the lithium and oxygen ( q@xmath23 and q@xmath24 ) .",
    "the second derivatives of these energy surfaces at zero displacements are the coefficients of the dynamical matrices .",
    "table [ coef ] shows the coefficients of the fit for the total energy of linbo@xmath0 and litao@xmath0 ; all the coefficients for linbo@xmath0 and litao@xmath0 are well constrained except the coefficient of @xmath25 , which means the potential surface describing the displacement of the lithium only could be either a single anharmonic well or a very shallow double well ( corresponding to a positive or a negative sign ) .",
    "linear and cubic terms ( e.g ; q and @xmath26 ) are excluded from the fit based on symmetry considerations , and terms which are not along the coordinates calculated ; @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , are excluded from the fit since they degrade the variances of the quadratic coefficient .",
    "these include terms like @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the dynamical matrix in units of @xmath32 representing the lapw energies of linbo@xmath0 and litao@xmath0 are @xmath33 @xmath34 the lithium - only contributions ( @xmath35 ) are the smallest ( an order of magnitude smaller then the rest ) , the oxygens only contributions are larger , with @xmath36 in litao@xmath0 larger than linbo@xmath0 .    whether the origin of lithium and oxygen coupling is coulombic can be determined by looking at the madelung contribution to the dynamical matrices .",
    "the madelung energies were calculated using experimental positions and lattice parameters and full ionic charges .",
    "the second derivatives at zero displacements , which are the elements in the dynamical matrix , were calculated numerically and are shown in table [ coef ] . in the case of linbo@xmath0 and",
    "litao@xmath0 the madelung contributions to the dynamical matrix are @xmath37 @xmath38    as expected , @xmath36 has the largest magnitude , followed by @xmath35 .",
    "the coupling term between the lithiums and the oxygens is in fact zero .",
    "this means that the origin of the lithium - oxygen coupling is _ not _ pure coulombic ( madelung ) .",
    "another possibility is the polarization of the oxygens by the lithium displacement , leading to changes in nb(ta)-o bonding .",
    "the experimental ferroelectric configuration generates an effective dipole at the lithium sites .",
    "this dipole field can polarize the oxygens and drive them off center , yielding a ferroelectric distortion .",
    "we have plotted the self - consistent charge densities in two configurations ; in one only the oxygens are displaced and in the other both the oxygens and the lithiums are displaced . in order to see the effects of displacing the lithiums we subtracted the two charge densities .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ polarization ] where the charge density contours are plotted on a scale of -0.1 to 0.1 electrons / bohr@xmath39 and the contour interval is 0.002 electrons / bohr@xmath39 .",
    "a large dipole is seen at the lithium sites due to the displacement of the lithiums .",
    "little polarization of the oxygens is observed ; there is no evidence for any large dynamical covalency effects .",
    "we can therefore eliminate the possibility of oxygen - lithium coupling through either madelung or polarization effects .",
    "another possible source for the oxygen - lithium coupling is through the crystal structure .",
    "it is important to notice that the oxygens move not only along the c axis , but rather have sizable displacements along the a and b axes as well .",
    "we have tested the importance of these displacements by moving only the oxygens along the c component of the experimental ferroelectric displacement ( the polar axis ) .",
    "the resulting energy curve was far shallower then the energy surface which resulted from moving the oxygens only along the experimental soft mode coordinate .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ zonly ] where the upper curve represents the displacements of the oxygens along the polar axis only and the lower , deeper well represents the total energy when displacing the oxygens along the experimental ferroelectric distortion ( along a , b and c axes ) .",
    "the reason for these big energy differences can be seen from table [ bonds ] which shows the ta - o , nb - o and li - o bond lengths .",
    "the ionic radii of li is about 0.6   , that of ta or nb is about 0.6    and the ionic radii of oxygen is about 1.4    @xcite , making the sum of each pair ( li - o , nb - o and ta - o ) about 2.0   . when the oxygens are displaced only along the c axis , the oxygen - nb ( ta ) separation becomes only 1.83 ( 1.86 )    which is about 0.17 ( 0.14 )    shorter then the sum of the ionic radii ( about 8 ( 7)% ) .",
    "therefore it is energetically favorable for the oxygens to displace in the a - b plane as they move along the c axis .",
    "if we now consider the experimental ferroelectric displacement of only the oxygens and the experimental ferroelectric _ coupled _ displacement of the oxygens and lithiums , displacing the oxygens only results in a li - o separation which is also shorter than the sum of their ionic radii ( table [ bonds ] ) .",
    "this explains why the wells associated with the oxygen displacements alone are shallower than those obtained with the displacement of _ both _ the lithiums and oxygens .",
    "the origin of the li - o coupling is therefore the fact that motion of the oxygens alone yields a li - o distance that is larger then the sum of their ionic radii , resulting in a deeper well for the coupled motion ( in which the li and oxygens move away from each other ) .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the driving mechanism behind the phase transformation in these systems is the displacement of the oxygens towards the transition metal atoms .",
    "displacement of the oxygens in the direction of the transition metal atoms only ( the c axis ) would result in too short nb ( ta)-oxygen bonds .",
    "the oxygens therefore move also in the plane perpendicular to the c axis , towards the lithiums .",
    "this shortens the lithium - oxygen bond so that the lithium displacements are coupled with the oxygen motions .",
    "the transition temperature , t@xmath7 , can not be calculated directly from the zone center energetics . in the usual models for ferroelectric phase transitions",
    ", t@xmath7 is related to the relative strength of the local ( on - site ) and coupling terms in the energy @xcite .",
    "since we find the zone center energetics to be similar , the difference in t@xmath7 must be due to differences in the energetics at the zone boundary .",
    "+ in order to understand the origin of the ferroelectric distortion , we next examine the electronic structure of these materials",
    ".      one goal of this research is to understand the origin of ferroelectricity in litao@xmath0 and linbo@xmath0 and the difference in @xmath3 from their electronic structure .",
    "[ dos2]a compares the electronic density of states for litao@xmath0 and linbo@xmath0 , both at the ferroelectric configuration .",
    "the energy scales are lined up with the top of the valence bands at zero energy .",
    "it is clear that the total density of states of these two materials is very similar .",
    "we can look further at the different contributions to the density of states ; fig .",
    "[ dos2]b compares the partial density of the ta 5d state and the nb 4d state both in the ferroelectric phase .",
    "the top of the valence band is composed mostly of oxygen p states . this figure shows a large density of transition metal d states in the valence band which means that the oxygen p states in these two materials are hybridized with the d states .",
    "the nb d states have a large peak at the bottom of this band which is missing in the case of the 5d states of the ta atom .",
    "the origin of this peak is the fact that the lowest valence bands of linbo@xmath0 ( the bands at about -4.5 ev or -0.35 ryd ) are less dispersive than the lowest valence bands of litao@xmath0 .",
    "this will be further discussed later .",

    "all three figures that compare the total and partial density of states of the two materials in their ferroelectric phase show large hybridization between the transition metal d states and the oxygen p states , which is the reason for the oxygen displacements towards the transition metal atoms .",

    "the valence bands are almost identical , which is consistent with the results of the total energy calculations where the two well depths were found to be very close to each other ( within 1.2 mry of each other ) and the fact that the number of valence electrons in the muffin tins in both materials was similar . the only difference which was found between the two electronic structures was in the size of the band gap and the less dispersive nature of one band .",
    "the difference in the band gap will have an effect on quantities which include summing over unoccupied states as well as the occupied ones , like the polarizability .",
    "this difference will lead to different phonon dispersion in the two materials , and thus to different t@xmath7 s .",
    "zone boundary or linear response calculations are necessary to further explore this issue .",
    "previously we studied the difference between the self - consistent charge densities and charge densities computed using overlapping ions with the pib model for both litao@xmath0 and linbo@xmath0 in the ferroelectric phase @xcite . in the pib model which is a non - empirical ionic model @xcite ,",
    "the charge densities are calculated via a gordon - kim type model @xcite , where the ions are allowed to breath corresponding to changes in the crystal potentials .",
    "the comparison indicated large hybridizations between the ta atoms and the oxygens and between the nb atoms and its oxygen neighbors and the li atoms were fully ionized in the self - consistent charge density .",
    "these results are consistent with the energetics and electronic structures results , all pointing to the same conclusion that the driving mechanism behind the ferroelectric instability in the linb(ta)o@xmath0 systems is the hybridization between the d states on the transition metal atoms and the 2p states on the oxygens .",
    "the lithiums are but passive players in the ferroelectric instability .",
    "this is very similar to the ferroelectric mechanism in the perovskite ferroelectrics , where the oxygen - transition metal atom hybridization , in addition to the coulombic long range interaction which tend to drive the system off center , overcome the short range repulsions which tend to leave the system in it s high - symmetry configuration .",
    "an interesting comparison can be made with the k(nb , ta)o@xmath2 system ; one major difference is the fact that the perovskite ktao@xmath2 is an incipient ferroelectric where litao@xmath0 has a high transition temperature . in this sense",
    "a qualitative comparison can be made between the two sets of systems , as in both systems the transition temperature is higher in the niobate systems , being zero for ktao@xmath0 .",
    "this would mean a shallower well for the tantalates , where in the case of ktao@xmath0 the well is apparently lower than the thermal vibrations , as shown by this study for the li(nb , ta)o@xmath0 systems and by postnikov for the k(nb , ta)o@xmath0 systems @xcite .",
    "the electronic structures of the two sets of systems ( linb(ta)o@xmath0 and knb(ta)o@xmath0 ) show a large hybridization between the transition metal atoms and the oxygens , and the amount of hybridization between the transition metals and the oxygens in the two sets of systems is similar .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ dos2]b which shows both the partial density of nb 4d states and that of ta 5d states in the valence bands in the ferroelectric configuration in the linb(ta)o@xmath0 systems .",
    "we can compare these results to the same densities of states calculated for knbo@xmath0 and ktao@xmath0 by lmto @xcite reproduced in fig .",
    "these figures show the nb ( ta ) density of states with the nb ( ta ) atom undisplaced and displaced by 0.073a ( a being the lattice constant ) along the @xmath15111@xmath16 direction , which is an exaggerated displacement used to enhance the differences between the two phases .",
    "we can see that the same trends exists in this picture as in fig .",
    "[ dos2]b for the nb ( ta ) in linbo@xmath0 ( litao@xmath0 ) .",
    "the ferroelectric peaks at the bottom of this band are slightly shifted towards higher energies . in both cases",
    "there is large hybridization between the transition metal atoms and the oxygens , but this hybridization does not change much during the transition .",
    "this hybridization is essential for the onset of the ferroelectric instability , however the amount of hybridization in this system does nt change much through the phase transition like in other ferroelectrics , e.g batio@xmath0 or pbtio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we find that linbo@xmath0 and litao@xmath0 are almost identical in their electronic behavior .",
    "the amount of d character in the valence bands , which is a measure of the hybridization between the transition metal ions and their oxygen neighbors is very similar .",
    "this is in contrast to the conclusion that ta is less ionic than nb , reached by postnikov _",
    "et al . _ for k(ta ,",
    "this conclusion was based on the smaller transition metal atom density of states peak at the bottom of the valence band , observed in figures [ pos]a and b. it is seen from fig . [ bancom ] that the origin of this peak is the less dispersive nature of one litao@xmath0 band versus linbo@xmath0 .",
    "the similarity between linb(ta)o@xmath0 and knb(ta)@xmath0 is the fact that the driving mechanism for the phase transition in the two systems is oxygen - b atom hybridization .",
    "the difference between the two systems lies in the different structure which yields a different oxygen - a atom interaction .    in both linb(ta)o@xmath0 and",
    "knb(ta)o@xmath0 the hybridization between the b atoms ( the transition metals ) and the oxygens causes the oxygens and the b atoms to displace towards each other . in the linb(ta)o@xmath0 system the oxygen - b atom separation is larger than the sum of their ionic radii and the oxygens markedly displace in the a - b plane as they move along the polar axis .",
    "this however , makes the oxygen - a atom separation larger then the sum of their ionic radii resulting in the coupled oxygen - a atom motion .",
    "this is in contrast to the perovskites where the a site is large enough to allow the oxygens to move towards the a atoms , e.g. knbo@xmath0 where the potassium - oxygen separation in the highest and lowest symmetry structures are about 2.85    and 2.83  , respectively , compared with the sum of their ionic radii which is about 2.78   .",
    "it is interesting to note that when doping ktao@xmath0 with lithium atoms ( klt ) , the system does displace off - center , with a critical concentration of lithiums as small as 2.2% @xcite .",
    "this could be the result of the lithium ion having a much smaller ionic radii then the potassium with respect to the perovskite structure , being about 0.6    for li and 1.4   for k @xcite .",
    "this would allow the lithiums , driven by madelung forces , to displace off - center , and due to the large space open to the lithiums in the perovskite structure their amplitudes will be much larger then in the litao@xmath0 system , resulting in a dipole field that polarizes the oxygens and distorts them into off - center positions .",
    "the phase transition in klt is significantly different then in a conventional ferroelectric and there is some discussion of whether klt is a true ferroelectric .",
    "_ @xcite concluded that the coincidence of the temperature of the maximum of the dielectric permittivity with the appearance of other anomalies that are characteristics of a structural transformation are a sign that the transition is ferroelectric , whereas azzini _",
    "@xcite state that the size of the domains having a homogeneous spontaneous polarization is significantly smaller than the size of the structural domains .    in the slater picture of the so called `` rattling ion ''",
    ", the b atom lies off center because it is too small to fit into the oxygen octahedra surrounding it .",
    "this is in fact the opposite of the picture in the linb(ta)o@xmath0 systems where the separation of the oxygens from the nb ( ta ) atoms are smaller ( 1.9 ) then the sum of their ionic radii ( 2 ) .",
    "also , a comparison of the ta - o distances in ktao@xmath2 and litao@xmath2 shows exactly this same effect . in ktao@xmath2 ,",
    "the oxygen octahedra is _ larger _ than the oxygen octahedra in litao@xmath2 , and yet , in ktao@xmath2 the b atom never displaces to the off center position , while in litao@xmath2 , the b cation exhibit a ferroelectric distortion .",
    "it is shown that linbo@xmath0 and litao@xmath0 are very similar in both their electronic structure and energetics .",
    "the differences in their well depth are very small , the amount of hybridization in the two materials is similar and the charge densities are similar . also , these two materials hardly change their electronic structure during a phase transition .",
    "the only difference found between these two systems is the difference in the conduction bands .",
    "zone boundary effects which are not included in this study and this difference in the electronic structure of the two systems are two possible candidates to explain the difference in the transition temperatures of the two systems .    it is demonstrated that contrary to previous models which emphasized the hopping of the lithium atoms between the three positions as the driving mechanism for the phase transformation , in these systems , no triple well potential was found for the lithium motion .",
    "the deep double wells found are the result of the oxygen displacements towards the transition metal atoms , which are the result of the hybridization between the two atoms .",
    "the wells indicate an order - disorder character for the oxygen .",
    "local changes in the oxygen octahedra are responsible for the lithium displacements from their centrosymmetric sites .",
    "the lithiums themselves are passive players in the ferroelectric energetics .",
