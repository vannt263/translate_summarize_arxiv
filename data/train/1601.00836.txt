    "although this excess could well be a statistical fluctuation , it has drawn significant attention as it can also arise from decay of new particle with mass around @xmath12 gev  @xcite .",
    "+ if the observed diphoton excess indeed corresponds to decay of a hitherto unknown particle then this will be the first confirmation of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "if the observed excess is due to a resonance it has to be a boson and it can not be a spin-@xmath16 particle  @xcite .",
    "this leaves the possibility of it being either a spin-@xmath17 or spin-@xmath18 particle .",
    "if it is indeed a new particle then one must wonder what kind of new physics incorporates it .",
    "this issue can only be settled by looking at various possible new physics scenarios that can potentially lead to such a particle .",
    "it is generally expected that this new physics will also be related to other open problems in high energy physics which do not have a satisfactory explanation within sm .",
    "chief among them is the problem of neutrino masses ( and their relative smallness ) and the nature of dark matter",
    ". it will be quite satisfying if the observed new particle has a natural connection with the models addressing at least one of these issues . in this work",
    "we assume this resonance to be a spin-@xmath17 particle and look at one such promising model based on gauge @xmath1 symmetry .",

    "is promoted to an anomaly free gauge symmetry by addition of three right handed neutrinos @xmath22 each transforming as @xmath23 under the @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it was shown that if this @xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken by a @xmath0 singlet scalar @xmath25 having two units of @xmath1 charge , then the right handed neutrinos can acquire a majorana mass term @xmath26 proportional to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath27 of the singlet scalar .",
    "moreover if the @xmath1 breaking scale is far greater than the electroweak scale then the right handed neutrinos acquire a large mass leading to a natural implementation of type i seesaw mechanism . however , in this scenario the @xmath1 breaking scale is expected to be very high ( same as seesaw scale ) and it is very difficult to test this model at lhc .",
    "+ recently , another simple choice of @xmath1 charges for right handed neutrinos which leads to anomaly free @xmath28 gauge symmetry has been proposed . unlike the previous case , here the",
    "three right handed neutrinos transform as @xmath29 under @xmath30 symmetry @xcite .",
    "it was shown that such a charge assignment can lead to dirac neutrinos with naturally small masses if the @xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken by a @xmath0 singlet scalar @xmath31 transforming as @xmath32 under @xmath28 symmetry .",
    "this new @xmath1 model can also have a candidate for long lived scalar dark matter if two new singlet scalars transforming as @xmath33 and @xmath34 under @xmath28 symmetry are added to it @xcite .",
    "unlike the conventional @xmath1 model , here the @xmath1 breaking scale need not be high and can be well within the reach of lhc .",
    "this opens up the possibility of testing various features of this model in the present run of lhc .",

    "the parameter space on the left of the red line is incompatible with the 8 tev data .",
    "as before , the constraints from other channels including the invisible decay to dark matter are rather weak and do not give any additional constraint . as an example",
    "the values for these decay channels for a benchmark point ( @xmath165 tev and @xmath171 gev ) on the @xmath167 exclusion line of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are given as    @xmath172    as clear from eq .",
    "[ dmexc ] , like the previous case here also only the constraints from @xmath136 channel for 8  tev run are important .",
    "the constraints from all other channels are comfortably satisfied .",
    "furthermore , just like the previous case , in this case also our model has enough parameter space compatible with both the observed 13  tev excess and the 8  tev constraints .",
    "thus the 750 gev excess can be understood in our model as the decay of @xmath96 to a pair of photons .",
    "+ finally , before ending the section we like to discuss briefly about the total decay width of @xmath96 for the two cases .",
    "the first thing to note is that given the current low statistics , the estimates of decay width are very poor .",
    "this aspect is highlighted by the fact that while cms data prefers narrow decay width of around a few gev for the resonance , the atlas prefers a relatively broader resonance with decay width @xmath9 gev .",
    "thus the current estimates of decay width are highly uncertain and are likely to change significantly in the future runs .",
    "+ in our model , if the @xmath96 decay to dark matter is kinematically forbidden then the dominant decay channels will all be loop induced with @xmath111 being the most significant .",
    "in such a scenario @xmath96 will be a narrow resonance with total decay width up to a few gevs .",
    "however , if @xmath96 decay to dark matter is kinematically allowed then it can have significant invisible decay width owing to the fact that such a decay is not loop suppressed .",
    "in this case the @xmath96 can be a broad resonance .",
    "+ if in future runs the atlas experiments estimates of a broad resonance persists then for our model it will imply a significant invisible decay width . depending on the value of @xmath122 , @xmath96 can have decay width upto 40 gev , albeit for a small parameter range .",
    "in such a case , a better solution can be obtained by adding a pair of @xmath0 singlet charged leptons to our model . however , at this stage we feel that such an extension of our model is premature and not necessary .",
    "the recently observed @xmath12 gev diphoton excess has drawn significant attention as it could be the first signs of new physics at lhc . although it is too early to conclude that this is a definite sign of new physics but nonetheless it raises an intriguing possibility that it might originate from decay of a hitherto unknown particle . in this work",
    "we have looked at the extended gauged @xmath1 symmetry model with unconventional charges for the right handed neutrinos as a possible candidate new physics model to explain the @xmath12 gev excess . the model was originally constructed to obtain dirac neutrinos with naturally small masses and also has a long lived dark matter particle . unlike the conventional gauged @xmath1 symmetry model where the @xmath1 scale is expected to be quite high , being related with the seesaw scale , in our model",
    "the @xmath1 scale can be well within the lhc range thus opening up the possibility of testing its various aspects at lhc .",
    "+ we have looked at the possibility that the observed diphoton excess can arise due to decay of the scalar particle @xmath96 into two photons .",
    "this scalar in our model is predominantly composed of the singlet scalars @xmath31 and @xmath100 which are essential ingredients of the model .",
    "they are required in order to spontaneously break the gauged @xmath1 symmetry as well as to obtain dirac neutrinos with small masses .",
    "we have further shown that the model not only explains the diphoton excess but also satisfies all the other experimental constraints like non - observation of any excess in dilepton , dijet , diboson and invisible channels .",
    "it also has a @xmath64 gev particle @xmath88 which has almost sm higgs like couplings to the other sm particles and satisfies all the other experimental constraints for the @xmath64 gev scalar .",
    "moreover , since in our model @xmath88 is predominantly composed of the @xmath0 doublet scalar with very small admixture from @xmath0 singlet scalars , it naturally explains why the @xmath64 gev particle has almost sm like couplings .",
    "+ thus to conclude , the gauged @xmath1 model considered here appears to be a promising candidate for new physics .",
    "it has all the right ingredients to explain not only the @xmath12 gev diphoton excess but all the other experimental results both for the @xmath12 gev resonance as well as the @xmath64 gev resonance .",
    "moreover , the model also connects the observed new physics with the already well know and long standing problems of neutrino masses and dark matter and attempts to provide a unifying solution to all of them . also , it has several testable predictions like existence of heavier particles in @xmath173 tev range , dirac nature of neutrinos and candidate for dark matter .",
    "these aspects can be tested in future run of lhc as well as in dark matter direct detection experiments and in various neutrino physics experiments .",
