    "the standard @xmath0 cosmology implies that galaxies grow during their history by accretion and mergers .",
    "we propose to use the power spectrum of the residual fluctuations of the rotation curve velocity as a probe of past mergers .",
    "the proposition relies on the plausible assumption that mergers induce large scale flows , and in the case of major mergers shocks are induced as well .",
    "the large scale flows and shocks can generate a turbulence , in the ism .",
    "the physical parameters of the ism make the generation of turbulence quite easy once an instability and an energy source are available and indeed turbulence in the ism is quite ubiquitous @xcite .",
    "the instabilities related to mergers are e.g. the kelvin helmholtz instability and the richtmyer - meshkov instability due to the shock acceleration .",
    "the spatial scale of the generated turbulence is expected to be comparable to the galactic disk size .",
    "such a large scale turbulence , is different from local turbulence generated by e.g. supernovae ( scale of the order of 10  pc ) , super shells resulting from chains of supernovae ( scale of the order of 100  pc ) , or winds from early type stars ( scale of the order of @xmath1  pc ) .",
    "moreover , a spatial scale comparable to a galactic size implies for turbulent rms velocities of the order of @xmath2 , a turbulence life time of a few gyr . for",
    "minor to medium mergers ( the most common ) the turbulence is expected to be subsonic and so its life time is even longer .",
    "the long life time of the turbulence implies that it can be detected also in nearby galaxies .",
    "thus , the turbulence serves as a fossil evidence of the past merger .",
    "if such primordial turbulence exists , it is expected to be superimposed on the rotation velocity .",
    "hence , part ( or all ) of the fluctuating residual of the observational rotation velocity may be identified with this primordial turbulence .",
    "hints for the existence of such a turbulence are found in observations of radial velocities in disks of galaxies and the observation of @xcite that the residual of the rotation velocity as function of the azimuthal angle along a ring in the galaxy plan , is oscillatory .",
    "the above velocities are of the order of @xmath3 .    the theoretical consideration and the observational hints motivate one to compute the observational power spectrum of the fluctuating residuals of the rotation velocity .",
    "the residuals depends of course on the definition of the mean rotation curve . to avoid this ambiguity we shall consider only galaxies with a flat rotation curve over a sizable part of the radial extent .",
    "the residuals are defined with respect to the constant mean value of the rotation velocity .",
    "the resulting observational power spectrum can be used to distinguish between random residuals ( or local small size fluctuations ) and fluctuations which are a manifestation of a galactic scale turbulence .",
    "if the latter is revealed , it means that it has been generated by a process with a spatial coherence scale comparable to that of the galaxy .",
    "a merger or close passage by another galaxy is the natural candidate .",
    "we derive the relation between the power spectrum of the observational residual rotation velocity , and the underlying 3d turbulence spectrum .",
    "this relation can be applied to determine the turbulence 3d spectral function from the observational power spectrum .",
    "in addition , the latter supplies an estimate for the line of sight depth of the turbulent region .    the method is demonstrated for the rotation curve of the spiral galaxy ngc3198 and leads to the conclusion that in spite its ordered shape , this galaxy has experienced a minor merger about 7 gyr ago .",
    "to test whether a large scale turbulence exists in a given galaxy one needs the relation between the power spectrum of the observational residuals and the spectral function of the underlying 3d turbulence . the observational rotation curve is usually obtained by use of the tilted ring model @xcite .",
    "we show that its power spectrum gives essentially the same results as a power spectrum of the residual position ",
    "velocity ( pv ) curve along a given axis on the galactic disk .",
    "the advantage is that the rotation velocity at a given radius , is based on many measurements at this radius , along the ring circumference and so the precision is better than that of the pv data which is based on a single measurement for each radius ..      the 3d spectral function of the turbulent velocity , @xmath4 is defined in terms of the 2-point correlation of the turbulent velocity field @xmath5 where the angular brackets denote ensemble averaging @xcite . in practice , the ergodic assumption is invoked and the ensemble average is replaced by space , area or line averages . for homogeneous turbulence the two point correlation is a function of the separation between the two points , so that    @xmath6    the inverse transform yields @xmath7 in the homogeneous and isotropic case @xmath8 depends only on the absolute value of the wave number and it is useful to introduce the turbulence energy spectrum @xmath9 and the turbulent velocity spectral function @xmath10 so that    @xmath11    the measured radial velocity at each position in the plane of the sky , is an intensity - weighted average of the velocity contributed by the emitting gas along the line of sight .",
    "a simplifying assumption of homogeneity translates this into a line of sight average of the velocity .    in the following two subsections",
    "we assume that a 3d large scale turbulence exists and derive the relations between the observational power spectrum of the pv and rotation curve data and the underlying 3d turbulence .",
    "the simplifying assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy are used .",
    "let us consider first the power spectrum of a position - velocity ( pv ) data , namely the rotation velocity as function of position along a given axis of the galaxy disk .",
    "this power spectrum is defined as fourier transform of the two point correlation of the observed residual velocity . denoting the axis as @xmath12 and the line of sight as @xmath13 , and",
    "the residual observed rotation velocity as @xmath14 , the power spectrum is    @xmath15    using the isotropy assumption and eq .",
    "[ phi1 ] one finds    @xmath16    which when inserted in eq .",
    "[ ppv1 ] leads to @xmath17 and integrations over @xmath18 yield @xmath19 with @xmath20 , the depth along the line of sight of the turbulent region . in the case of a disk galaxy @xmath21 with @xmath22 denoting the scale height of the disk and @xmath23 the inclination angle .    for an homogeneous and isotropic turbulence ,",
    "the 3d turbulence spectral function is a power law of the absolute value of the wavenumber : @xmath24 .    in the incompressible subsonic case",
    "the spectrum is the kolmogorov spectrum with @xmath25 @xcite . for compressible supersonic turbulence @xmath26 .",
    "the steeper slope is due to the fact that a fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy density at a given wavenumber is converted to compression work decreasing the rate of energy transfer to the larger wavenumbers .",
    "integration over @xmath27 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 yields @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant depending on @xmath32 and @xmath20 .",
    "one can further express the power spectrum in the form @xmath33 the power spectrum is a power law with index @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "this effect of the change of the power law index was found observationally by @xcite for the @xmath38 power spectrum of the lmc , by @xcite for the @xmath38 power spectrum of ngc1058 and recently by @xcite for the infrared power spectrum of the lmc , and by @xcite for both the velocity and mid infrared power spectra of the shocked nebulae near the turbulent galactic center .",
    "the results of the last two references are based on the spitzer data .",
    "the rotation curve is obtained by use of the tilted ring model @xcite in which the disk is approximated as a superposition of concentric rings or annuli .",
    "the observed velocity field is then used to derive for each ring a rotation velocity , an inclination angle and a position angle .",
    "the rotation curve velocity as function of radius obtained in this way is more accurate than the pv curve , since the value at each radius is derived from multiple observational values .",
    "this motivates a computeation of the power spectrum of the residual fluctuations of the rotation curve and its use to test for the existence of an underlying 3d turbulence . for random fluctuations",
    "the power spectrum is expected to be independent of the wavenumber .",
    "if however , the power spectrum varies in an ordered manner with the wavenumber it is possible that it reflects an underlying turbulence .    as in the case of the pv power spectrum",
    "there is the need to obtain the relation between the observationally computed power spectrum and the underlying turbulence spectral function . in the case of the rotation curve",
    "this task seems a prioiri more difficult than the pv case since the rotation velocity is fitted to the observed line of sight velcities along the ring circumference and not measured durectly along a given line in the plane of the disk . for simplicity",
    "the fit along the ring is represented as a simple average over its circumference , so that @xmath39 as in the pv case , here too use of eq .",
    "[ phi1 ] and assuming isotropy of the turbulence imply @xmath40    @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the wavenuber in the plane of the sky and @xmath43 denotes its azimuthal angle . in the integration along the ring circumference",
    "@xmath43 spans an interval of @xmath44 and so do @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "one gets ,    @xmath47    @xmath48 @xmath49 with @xmath50 denoting the zero order bessel function of the first kind .    for an underlying 3d turbulence characterized by a power law spectral function @xmath51 ,",
    "the integrations on @xmath52 and @xmath53 yield @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant depending on the index @xmath32 and @xmath20 is the depth along the line of sight .",
    "the analytic integrations over r and k leading to eq .",
    "( [ prot4 ] ) were done using the @xcite software .",
    "one can further express the power spectrum in the form @xmath56 note that the observational power spectrum of the residual velocity curve has the same relation with respect to the underlying 3d turbulence as does the observational pv power spectrum .",
    "this result should not come as a surprise since the rotation curve can be regarded as an averaging of pv data along many axes . as a result",
    ", the power spectrum of its residual fluctuations is an average of the pv power spectra and hence share the same relation with the spectrum of the underlying 3d turbulence .",

    "[ fig : pq ] displays the observational power spectrum as function of @xmath57 for an underlying 3d kolmogorov turbulence characterized by @xmath25 . for spatial scales much larger than the depth along the line of sight , the index of the power spectrum is @xmath59 and for spatial scales much smaller than the depth it approaches @xmath60 .",
    "the transition between the two regimes is at @xmath61 and there the logarithmic slope is @xmath62 .",
    "the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to ngc9183 .",
    "the latter appears to be a rather ordered galaxy , although some deviations from regularity were noted .",
    "the @xmath38 column densities do not exceed @xmath63 so the optical depth is rather small .",
    "the data presented in table 2 . of @xcite show a very flat rotation curve for radial distances in the range @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath65 .",

    "are plotted in fig .",
    "2 as function of radial distance in units of arcminutes .",
    "up to 3 , the radial distances are spaced by 0.25 and later by 0.5. since the computation of power spectra requires even spacings , we omitted the data points at positions @xmath66 thus there remain overall 20 evenly spaced data points .",
    "note that the uncertainties are @xmath67 ; substantially smaller than the 15.5 km / s uncertainty in a single measurement @xcite .",
    "this arises from the use of many measurements along the ring and demonstrates the advantage of using a rotation curve rather than a pv data .",
    "the residual velocity shown in fig .",
    "[ vel ] does seem to exhibit fluctuations , as function of radial distance .",

    "the @xcite software was used to compute the power spectrum of the residual rotation curve velocity as function of the wavenumberwas @xmath68 , with @xmath69 denoting the corresponding spatial scale .",
    "because of the cyclic nature of the discrete fourier transform , the power spectrum is obtained for relative wavenumbers in the range @xmath70 with @xmath71 corresponding @xmath72 , the largest spatial scale of the turbulence and @xmath73 corresponds to @xmath74 , which is about twice the radial spacing between the observations used in the present analysis .    to obtain the error bars for the observational power spectrum we performed @xmath75 simulations of `` observational '' velocity sets .",
    "at each position a velocity was randomly chosen from a normal distribution with a mean equal to the observational value at this position and a standard deviation equal to the observational uncertainty at this position .",
    "for each such set , the power spectrum was computed and subsequently the standard deviations , at each wavenumber , of the logarithm of the simulated power spectra .",
