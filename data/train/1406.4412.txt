    "swimming microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature , and have long been known to play important roles in marine life ecosystems , animal reproduction , and infectious diseases . in these processes , cell motility is crucial.@xcite at the small scales relevant to swimming cells , inertial forces are negligible , and locomotion is constrained by purcell s `` scallop '' theorem stating that any body deformation reversible in time yields zero net motion.@xcite fluid - based cellular motility relies therefore on non - time reversible deformation , for instance by propagating waves along cilia or flagella.@xcite    among the various types of locomotion seen in nature , one commonly observed for bacteria is that of helical propulsion , where a flagellum ( or a bundle of flagella ) rotates as a helix , inducing forward propulsion . a typical example of an organism employing helical propulsion is the bacterium _ escherichia coli _",
    "coli_).@xcite this bacterium alternates `` run '' and `` tumble '' periods : in the former , flagella are synchronized in a coherent bundle and propel the cell forward , whereas in the latter flagella are disorganized , changing the cell orientation and subsequent swimming direction . during run periods , when _ e. coli _",
    "cells are isolated in a bulk flow , they swim in straight ( noisy ) lines .",
    "however , cell locomotion is strongly affected by nearby boundaries .",
    "swimming microorganisms often evolve in confined environments , be it by solid boundaries , free surfaces , or liquid interfaces . in some cases",
    ", confinement results from channel boundaries , for example along the mammalian female reproductive tract.@xcite surfaces can also be a key element in the microorganism function , as in the case of surface associated infection or biofilm formation.@xcite since such problems are dominated by viscous dissipation , long - range hydrodynamic interactions have been argued to play important roles , resulting in a significant alteration of the locomotion of microorganisms.@xcite over the past years , intensive theoretical , numerical and experimental work has helped uncover the kinematics and dynamics modifications of swimming properties by boundaries.@xcite    for bacteria employing helical propulsion ( such as _ e. coli _ ) , two different effects induced by boundaries have been discovered and quantified .",
    "these organisms swim in the forward direction ( cell body forward ) and are being propelled from the back .",
    "they thus push on the surrounding fluid forward and backward , and such swimmers are referred to as `` pushers '' . in the presence of a nearby solid wall , _",
    "e. coli _ tends to aggregate close to walls.@xcite this is in fact observed for any kind of pusher , not necessarily one exploiting helical propulsion.@xcite a second property , observed solely for helical swimmers , is a circular motion of the cells in a plane parallel to the surface .",
    "this was accounted for both experimentally and theoretically in the case of a solid wall @xcite and a free surface.@xcite notably , the circular motion occurs in an opposite direction in the presence of a solid wall ( clockwise , cw , when viewed from inside the fluid ) or a free surface ( counterclockwise , ccw , see fig .",

    "this change in rotation direction is qualitatively similar to the drag increase or decrease observed for the motion of a colloidal particle near a rigid wall and a free surface.@xcite indeed , a solid wall and a free surface induce opposite effects , no - slip for a rigid boundary vs.  free slip in the case of a free interface .    , and counter - clockwise motion at a free surface ( right panel ) [ reprinted figure with permission from r. di leonardo , d. dellarciprete , l. angelani , and v. iebba , phys . rev .",

    "past experimental results have been explained theoretically considering newtonian fluids and perfect interfaces , meaning either a no - slip wall or a shear - free surface .",
    "theoretical models do predict a single circular direction , cw in the presence of a solid wall vs.  ccw in the presence of a free surface , and are consistent with the results illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "however , recent experiments on _ e. coli _ swimming near glass plates and free surfaces show that the distinction in the direction of the circular motion is not straightforward , and both cw and ccw rotations are observed under seemingly similar experimental conditions.@xcite in the initial study of lemelle",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 2010),@xcite only cw motion was observed above a glass plate , but both cw and ccw at a free surface , suggesting that particles and surfactants could alter the free slip boundary condition .",
    "this hypothesis was further investigated by changing the concentration of a particular polymer that can aggregate at a free surface.@xcite the authors confirmed this qualitative change of behavior , observing a clear dependence on the polymer concentration of the fraction of cells undergoing ccw motion .",
    "a similar change in rotation direction was recently highlighted experimentally at a solid wall , when the solution contains polymers.@xcite using a special surface treatment , the polymer concentration at the solid wall was modified , generating possible slip , and resulting in ccw motion .",
    "these recent experiments demonstrate that the presence of polymers or surfactants could have a dramatic effect on motility of nearby cells . in this paper",
    "we present a modeling approach to quantify the dynamics of swimming bacteria near complex interfaces .",
    "when polymers are present in the solution , their concentration close to surfaces is reduced due to higher shear and confinement.@xcite this wall depletion results in the formation of a thin fluid layer of lower viscosity at the wall , thereby modifying significantly the no - slip condition . on scales larger than this thin layer",
    ", the equivalent behavior at the wall is an apparent partial slip , characterized by its slip length @xmath0 ranging from @xmath1  nm to 10  @xmath2m.@xcite similarly , a liquid interface covered with surfactants acts as a thin two - dimensional fluid layer separating the liquid phases .",
    "this layer has its own rheological properties , and modifies the stress and velocity jumps between the two fluids.@xcite as a consequence , the presence of surfactants can affect significantly the boundary conditions and resulting flow.@xcite    in the present work , we address the role of altered boundary conditions on swimming microorganisms , focusing on interface - induced reorientation , attraction vs.  repulsion by the surface , and the impact on circular motion .",
    "using an analytical framework based on multipole expansions for describing the hydrodynamic interactions between a swimming microorganism and an interface , we show how complex interfaces affect hydrodynamic interactions , providing possible explanations to past experimental results . whereas interface alignment and attraction are seen to be universal properties , the direction of the circular motion turns out to strongly depends on the properties of the fluid , on the bacterium shape and , in some cases , the distance to the interface .    in sec .",

    "[ fig:2]a : ( i ) a clean interface , i.e.  a fluid - fluid interface with no surfactant , ( ii ) a flat surface with a partial slip condition as a model for a polymer depletion layer , and ( iii ) a liquid interface covered with incompressible surfactants . in the case of flow generated by swimming microorganisms , the typical capillary number , scaling",
    "the flow - induced stress with surface tension , is very small , typically lower than @xmath3 . as a consequence we will neglect any interfacial deformation induced by the microorganisms , and focus therefore on planar interfaces with normal @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a ) .",
    "the first type of interface we will consider is a clean interface between two fluids . this problem is characterized by the viscosity ratio between the two fluids , @xmath5 where the reference viscosity @xmath6 is the viscosity of the fluid where the bacterium is located . if the viscosity of the second fluid vanishes , @xmath7 , the interface behaves as a free surface , whereas if the second fluid viscosity tends to infinity , we have @xmath8 , and the interface becomes equivalent to a rigid wall .",
    "a clean liquid interface imposes impermeability and the continuity of tangential velocities and stresses.@xcite the corresponding boundary conditions written at @xmath9 are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the symmetric rate of strain tensor , and where we have used the superscript @xmath12 to denote fluid @xmath12 . in the case of a free surface ( @xmath7 ) , these equations reduce to a free slip condition , whereas in the limit of a rigid wall ( @xmath13 ) , the boundary imposes a no - slip condition , @xmath14 .      the second type of interfaces that we will consider models a rigid wall when the fluid contains polymers , and therefore is subjected to wall depletion . for simplicity ,",

    "@xmath22 ) the bulk ( resp .  surface ) stress tensor.@xcite in the present analysis , it is appropriate to focus on the stationary limit on the length scales of swimming bacteria . additionally , we assume that the concentration of surfactant on the surface is large enough so that the relative change in surface tension is of order 1 . in that case , as the capillary number is very small ( typically lower than @xmath3 ) , the surfactant concentration can be considered to be uniform on the surface.@xcite under this assumption , the interface is incompressible , @xmath23 , and the surface stress tensor reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the surface tension and @xmath26 the in - plane rate of strain tensor.@xcite the resulting boundary conditions at @xmath9 state continuity of in - plane velocity , no flow perpendicular to the surface , in - plane incompressibility , and balance between shear stresses from the outside flows , surface viscous stresses and marangoni stresses @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the non - dimensional surface viscosity , @xmath29 @xmath30 being a flow length scale , chosen here to be the bacterium distance to the wall.@xcite the parameter @xmath28 is often referred to as boussinesq number , comparing surface to bulk stresses @xcite .",
    "note that the condition for incompressibility prevents the limit of a clean interface to be reached by simply applying @xmath31 , and only the case of a no - slip boundary can be recovered in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "in order to analyze the effect of an interface on the swimming microorganism , we decompose the flow into two contributions , one being the flow generated by the same organism in the absence of interface , @xmath33 , and a contribution due solely to the interface , @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 . the effect of the interface on the swimming microorganism",

    "the problem of a point singularity located close to a boundary with specific conditions is blake s method , presented first for the problem of a stokeslet close to a rigid wall @xcite .",

    "for example , in the case of a stokeslet close to a free surface , a good guess for @xmath62 is a stokeslet symmetric with respect to the interface , which is enough to enforce both the impermeability condition and that of zero shear stress , resulting in @xmath65 .",

    "the main assumption made in our paper is that we have only considered the leading - order hydrodynamics effects for all influences of the interfaces ( attraction and rotation ) .",
    "this is , admittedly , a severe assumption which is expected to break down as soon as the cell is within about one body length from the interface . in order to obtain more quantitative predictions , one would then need to either include the effect of higher - order singularities , or resort to a fully computational approach .",
    "the advantage of our approach however is that it allows us to identify the fundamental physical process at play in setting the direction of rotation , and that it is expected to remain valid generically for all cells exploiting helical swimming .",

    "<S> flagellated bacteria exploiting helical propulsion are known to swim along circular trajectories near surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> fluid dynamics predicts this circular motion to be clockwise ( cw ) above a rigid surface ( when viewed from inside the fluid ) and counter - clockwise ( ccw ) below a free surface . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental investigations showed that complex physicochemical processes at the nearby surface could lead to a change in the direction of rotation , both at solid surfaces absorbing slip - inducing polymers and interfaces covered with surfactants . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these results , we use a far - field hydrodynamic model to predict the kinematics of swimming near three types of interfaces : clean fluid - fluid interface , slipping rigid wall , and a fluid interface covered by incompressible surfactants . </S>",
    "<S> representing the helical swimmer by a superposition of hydrodynamic singularities , we first show that in all cases the surfaces reorient the swimmer parallel to the surface and attract it , both of which are a consequence of the stokes dipole component of the swimmer flow field . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that circular motion is induced by a higher - order singularity , namely a rotlet dipole , and that its rotation direction ( cw vs.  ccw ) is strongly affected by the boundary conditions at the interface and the bacteria shape . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest thus that the hydrodynamics of complex interfaces provide a mechanism to selectively stir bacteria . </S>"
