    "the measurement of resonances provides an important tool for studying the dynamics in relativistic heavy - ion collisions by probing the time evolution of the source from chemical to kinetic freeze - out and the hadronic interactions at later stages .",

    "the @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite , and @xmath4 @xcite production were measured via their hadronic decay channels at mid - rapidity ( @xmath8 ) in au+au and p+p collisions at @xmath9 200 gev using the star detector at rhic .",
    "the @xmath10 @xcite meson was also measured via its hadronic decay channel in au+au collisions using the phenix detector .",

    "[ fig : mass ] for peripheral au+au ( 40 - 80@xmath13 of the hadronic cross - section ) , high multiplicity p+p ( top 10@xmath13 of the minimum bias p+p multiplicity distribution for @xmath14 0.5 ) , and minimum bias p+p interactions .",
    "the @xmath11 mass was obtained by fitting the data to a p - wave breit - wigner function times the phase space ( bw@xmath15ps ) described in @xcite .",

    "the @xmath11 mass for high multiplicity p+p interactions is lower than for minimum bias p+p interactions for all @xmath12 bins , showing that the @xmath11 mass is also multiplicity dependent .",

    "the @xmath36 cross - section is larger than the @xmath37 cross - section by a factor of @xmath335 @xcite .",

    "one interpretation of this result is that the daughter rescattering is the dominant process compared to the @xmath16 regeneration , since only @xmath16 with higher @xmath12 are more likely to decay outside the fireball . in the case of central au+au collisions ,",
    "the @xmath16 @xmath38 is comparable to that of @xmath41 possibly because the hadron production increases and the regeneration process becomes significant .",
    "the @xmath10 @xmath42 is independent of @xmath32 in au+au collisions .",
    "this is expected if the @xmath10 has a smaller cross - section and therefore less sensitivity to hadronic rescattering .",
    "we have presented results on resonance production at mid - rapidity in au+au and p+p collisions at @xmath44 @xmath23 200 gev . the measured @xmath11 and @xmath16 masses are @xmath12 dependent and lower than previous measurements reported in @xcite . dynamical interactions with the surrounding matter , interference between various scattering channels , phase space distortions , and bose - einstein correlations are possible explanations for the apparent modification of resonances properties .",
