    "these include a high thermopower when doped , @xcite although high figures of merit @xmath4 have not been realized due to the combination of thermal and electrical conductivity .",
    "the compound shows non - magnetic behavior , but remarkably when modestly electron doped by ge a ferromagnetic quantum critical point emerges and the ground state becomes a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "@xcite such quantum critical systems can show unconventional and sometimes remarkable physical properties , especially if the magnetic system is strongly coupled to itinerant electrons and if the itinerant electrons are heavy . from an experimental point of view",
    ", fega@xmath0 does show evidence that it is in this regime , from transport , specific heat and other measurements .",
    "@xcite for example , umeo and co - workers report a specific heat @xmath5 of 70 mj k@xmath6 per mole for fega@xmath7ge@xmath8 , @xmath9=0.09 , while the thermopower @xmath10 , as mentioned is large , e.g. @xmath11 - 400 ",
    "-560 @xmath12v / k . for @xmath1-type carrier concentrations in the 10@xmath13 @xmath14 range .",
    "@xcite    several density functional theory ( dft ) studies using standard functionals ( with no additional correlation term , such as @xmath15 in lda+@xmath15 calculations ) have shown that the band gap of fega@xmath0 is well described without magnetism on the fe and without strong correlation effects .",
    "@xcite however , yin and pickett also reported calculations with an additional interaction @xmath15 in lda+@xmath15 calculations . @xcite",
    "they observed that at modest values of @xmath16=1.4 ev ( @xmath17 is the hund s parameter in the lda+@xmath15 calculations , the dependence is on @xmath16 ) an antiferromagnetic state appears , with moments somewhat below 1 @xmath18 , which is the spin 1/2 value . it has subsequently been argued that the observed magnetism in doped fega@xmath0 is related to these moments , specifically that the additional carriers break up singlets formed by spin 1/2 fe dimers in the structure leading to free spins that order ferromagnetically .",
    "@xcite    there are some questions related this explanation .",
    "first of all the undoped compound is diamagnetic below room temperature , @xcite and the susceptibility shows an increase above room temperature consistent with free carriers generated for a band gap in accord with the measured band gap .",
    "@xcite secondly , @xmath19fe mossbauer spectra show no magnetism in the undoped compound .",
    "third , the thermoelectric transport properties of ruga@xmath0 are osga@xmath0 indicate similar behavior to fega@xmath0 allowing for carrier concentration differences ; @xcite this indicates a similar electronic structure . finally , while yin and pickett @xcite indicate that they obtain qualitatively similar behavior and predictions independent of the + @xmath15 double counting scheme ( i.e. fully localized limit ( fll or sic ) ) or around mean field ( amf ) ) , osorio - guillen and co - workers @xcite report that they find no local moments with an optimized double counting scheme intermediate between these limits .    here",
    "we present first principles calculations showing that the magnetism of doped fega@xmath0 can be readily explained in an itinerant picture without the need for pre - existing moments in the semiconducting state and without the need for correlation terms .",
    "we also present boltzmann transport calculations of the thermopower and a resolution of the differences between the results of yin and pickett @xcite and those of osorio - guillen and co - workers .",
    "the present calculations were performed within density functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe ) .",
    "@xcite for this purpose we used the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method @xcite as implemented in the wien2k code .",
    "@xcite we used lapw sphere radii of 2.05 bohr for both fe and ga , with highly converged basis sets .",
    "we used the standard lapw basis set with additional local orbitals rather than the more efficient but potentially less accurate apw+lo method .",
    "we did calculations both in a scalar relativistic approximation and also including spin orbit .",
    "we did not find significant differences between these .",
    "we also did gga+@xmath15 calculations both with the fully localized limit ( sic ) double counting and the around mean field ( amf ) double counting . for consistency ,",
    "the gga+@xmath15 results discussed here were also done with the pbe gga .",
    "we used the experimental crystal structure , i.e. tetragonal @xmath20 , @xmath21=6.2628  , @xmath22=6.5546  , fe at ( 0.3437,0.3437,0 ) , ga1 at ( 0,0.5,0 ) , ga2 at ( 0.1556,0.1556,0.262 ) , and four formula units per unit cell .",
    "each fe atom in this structure has eight ga neighbors at distances between 2.36  and 2.50  , which is an arrangement that is not favorable for strong @xmath23 bonding , as well as one nearby fe atom at @xmath32.77  .",
    "these relatively short bonded fe - fe pairs are the dimers discussed by yin and pickett .",
    "@xcite interestingly , the calculated forces on the atoms were zero to the precision of the calculation ( largest force was below 2 mry / bohr in scalar relativistic calculations ) for this structure .",
    "this is in contrast to the fe - based superconductors , where non - magnetic density functional calculations yield large errors in the structure relative to experiment , a fact that is thought to be related to the interplay between bonding and magnetism in those compounds .",
    "the electronic density of states ( dos ) as obtained with the pbe gga is shown in fig . [ dos ] .",
    "the valence electronic structure is semiconducting and consists of a broad set of ga derived @xmath24 bands starting at @xmath3 - 11 ev with respect to the valence band maximum ( vbm )",
    ". a much narrower set of fe @xmath23 bands overlap these and extend from @xmath3 - 2 ev to @xmath3 + 2 ev with respect to the vbm .",
    "the fe @xmath23 derived part of the dos ( fig .",
    "[ dos ] ) consists of narrow peaks and makes practically no contribution below @xmath3 - 3 ev binding energy and certainly not near the bottom of the ga @xmath24 bands , indicating relatively weak bonding between the fe @xmath23 and ga @xmath24 systems .",

    "[ bands ] .",
    "the calculated band gap is @xmath25=0.426 ev including spin orbit , and becomes only slightly larger ( 0.428 ev ) if spin orbit is neglected .",
    "this small difference presumably reflects the fact that the states at the band edges come from very narrow ( @xmath260.5 ev wide ) fe @xmath23 bands with little ga @xmath2 contribution ( spin orbit is stronger for @xmath2 states than @xmath23 states and for heavier atoms , i.e. ga rather than fe ) .",
    "it is also notable that the valence and conduction bands have different orbital characters . with the crystallographic setting above the conduction band minimum ( cbm )",

    "the energies are @xmath29 relative to the vbm or cbm , respectively .",
    "the shading is by velocity .",
    "spin orbit is included . the corresponding hole or electron counts in parenthesis on a per unit cell , four formula unit basis , are for hole doped -0.16 ev ( 0.93 ) , -0.12 ev ( 0.43 ) , -0.08 ev ( 0.21 ) , -0.04 ev ( 0.09 ) and for electron doped , 0.04 ev ( 0.03 ) , 0.08 ev ( 0.08 ) , 0.12 ev ( 0.17 ) , and 0.16 ev ( 0.51 ) . ]",
    "turning to the structure of the dos , one notes that the dos increases very rapidly away from the band edges reflecting the narrow bands and reaches high values well above 2 ev@xmath30 on a per fe basis .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a stoner mechanism for itinerant ferromagnetism when doped .",
    "such a steep density of states in a material that can be doped metallic is also favorable for obtaining high thermopowers at high doping levels .",
    "this is one ingredient in obtaining thermoelectric performance ( the others are low lattice thermal conductivity and high mobility ; the figure of merit is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath33 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath34 is the thermopower ) .",
    "before discussing the magnetism , we briefly mention the fermi surface for doped material and the thermopower .",
    "[ fermi-2 ] shows the calculated fermi surface for rigid band shifts of the fermi energy , @xmath29 into the conduction and valence band edges .",
    "as may be seen , besides having different orbital character , the fermi surfaces for hole and electron doped material are very different . for lightly electron doped material ,",
    "the fermi surface consists of a three dimensional electron section near the @xmath35 point . at low carrier concentration",
    "this is a pocket off the @xmath35 point along the @xmath36-@xmath35 direction corresponding to the cbm in fig .",
    "[ bands ] .",
    "the two pockets on the opposite sides of the @xmath37=1/2 zone boundary then merge to form the @xmath35 point pocket , which has a narrowing in the @xmath37=1/2 plane as seen .",
    "the critical composition at which ferromagnetism is reported to start is at @xmath38=0.043 , @xcite which corresponds to a band filling between the 0.08 and 0.12 ev plots of fig .",
    "[ fermi-2 ] .",
    "as the carrier density further increases , a second pocket develops around @xmath35 and the fermi surface forms connections along the @xmath37 direction , as shown in the bottom right panel of the figure . for higher carrier concentration ( not shown )",
    "these connections merge to form a complex shaped cylinder while @xmath35 centered sections remain . besides observing the complexity of the fermi surface",
    ", one may note that it is clearly three dimensional with substantial dispersion in both the in - plane and @xmath37 directions .",
    "this is in contrast to other well studied layered materials that may be near ferromagnetic quantum critical points , i.e. na@xmath39coo@xmath40 , @xcite and sr@xmath0ru@xmath40o@xmath41 .",
    "@xcite the fermi surfaces for hole doping are pockets around the @xmath42 point .",
    "these connect in the @xmath37=0.5 plane for higher doping levels .",
    "as seen these are also very three dimensional .",
    "we calculated the doping dependent thermopower with a rigid band approximation and the constant scattering time approximation , similar to recent studies on thermoelectric materials .",
    "@xcite this was done using the boltztrap code , @xcite which employs a smooth interpolation of the energy bands on a fine grid to calculate band velocities and perform transport integrals .",

    "[ seeb - p ] and [ seeb - n ] , respectively . as may be seen ,",
    "the behavior is rather symmetric between @xmath2 and @xmath1 type in that high values of @xmath10 are obtained at relatively high doping levels @xmath310@xmath43 @xmath14 .",
    "also the thermopower is rather isotropic as is typically but not always the case .",
    "@xcite    hadano and co - workers @xcite obtained an @xmath1-type thermopower reaching @xmath3 - 350 @xmath12v / k at 300 k , which is consistent with the highest thermopower at that temperature in our calculations .",
    "the inferred carrier concentration is then @xmath44 @xmath14 or slightly below , and the downturn at higher @xmath45 is presumably due to bi - polar transport .",
    "amagai and co - workers @xcite obtained @xmath46=-563 @xmath12v / k on a sample with a hall carrier concentration of 3.1x10@xmath13 @xmath14 . taking the hall concentration as the absolute carrier concentration",

    "haldolaarachchige and co - workers @xcite also reported high room temperature values , though somewhat lower than those of amagai and co - workers , on nominally stoichiometric fega@xmath0 , with a decrease upon doping with co and ge .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath10 are relatively high compared to most semiconductors , reflecting the narrow bands around the band edges .",
    "these are sufficient that one might expect good thermoelectric performance in this compound if the doping level can be optimized and the other properties are favorable . in this regard the reported lattice",
    "thermal conductivity of fega@xmath0 is 3.7 w / mk at 300 k and decreases to @xmath3 2 w / mk at at 900 k. @xcite these are reasonably low values consistent with a thermoelectric material that can be used at high @xmath45 .",
    "we note that the @xmath45 dependence suggests that some of the reported lattice thermal conductivity at high @xmath45 could in fact have an origin in the bi - polar conduction . in any case",
    ", the thermal conductivity was observed to decrease with doping .",
    "@xcite while the values of the experimental thermoelectric figures of merit reported to date are not high , the present results for the thermopower suggest that the best performance would be obtained at high @xmath45 ( 750 k and above ) with carrier concentrations of 3x10@xmath43 @xmath14 - 1x10@xmath47 @xmath14 for both @xmath2-type and @xmath1-type .",

    "we examined the possibility of itinerant stoner ferromagnetism using direct calculations .",
    "these included virtual crystal calculations , with the virtual crystal approximation applied to the ga site as well as supercell calculations in which a ge atom was substituted on either the ga1 or ga2 sites in cell ( i.e. @xmath49=1/12 ) .",
    "we also did calculations where one of the four fe atoms in the unit cell was replaced by co. in these calculations with partial substitution , we kept the lattice parameters fixed , but relaxed the atomic coordinates by total energy minimization .",
    "these three ordered cells all contain one electron per unit cell more than stoichiometric fega@xmath0 .",
    "we start with the virtual crystal approximation , which allows for arbitrary doping levels .",
    "the main result is shown in fig .",
    "we find itinerant ferromagnetism starting at low doping levels , @xmath500.03 .",
    "this becomes half metallic almost immediately as the doping level is increased .",
    "this half metallic ferromagnetic state persists up to @xmath500.15 , after which the moment saturates and turns down above @xmath500.2 , i.e. going over to an ordinary ferromagnetic metal .",
    "the ferromagnetism is lost near @xmath49=0.3    half metals are ferromagnets where one spin channel is semiconducting , while the other is metallic . @xcite in such materials , spin flip scattering is blocked and ferromagnetic domain walls can have high resistance , leading to unusual magnetotransport phenomena such as large negative magnetoresistance .",
    "such materials are also of interest as  spin - tronic \" materials , since their electrical transport is entirely in one spin channel , and also because the magnetic excitation spectrum is different than in ordinary metallic ferromagnets , in particular as regards the stoner continuum . in the present case ,",

    "@xcite the critical ge concentration in experiment is reported to be @xmath510.043 , which is close to but above the calculated value .",
    "this is in contrast to standard density functional results for other quantum critical systems . in several of those cases",
    "the magnetic state is overly stable relative to experiment , reflecting neglect of quantum critical fluctuations in standard density functional calculations .",
    "@xcite this may imply that the magnitude of the critical fluctuations in fe(ga@xmath52ge@xmath39)@xmath0 are weaker than those in e.g. sr@xmath0ru@xmath40o@xmath41 , which would imply a smaller region in temperature - composition ( corresponding to temperature - field in sr@xmath0ru@xmath40o@xmath41 ) space showing quantum criticallity associated with nearness to ferromagnetism .    the calculated fermi surface for ferromagnetic fe(ga@xmath53ge@xmath48)@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fermi ] .",
    "the material is half - metallic at this composition .",
    "the composition corresponds to a charge of 1.2 additional electrons per unit cell relative to fega@xmath0 .",
    "not surprisingly , the fermi surface is large and complex for this high electron count .",
    "as mentioned , it is clearly not a two dimensional electron system .",
    "this illustrates the continuous evolution of the material with doping from a low carrier density ferromagnetic semiconductor to a half metallic large fermi surface metal .",
    "it is not known how to heavily dope @xmath2-type in this compound .",
    "however , not surprisingly in view of the dos , we also find in virtual crystal calculations that the compound will become a half - metallic ferromagnetic metal in this case .",
    "it will be of interest to investigate potential @xmath2-type dopants to determine whether a ferromagnetic quantum critical point can be obtained in this case as well .",
    "as mentioned , calculations were also done for ordered cells .",
    "we find half metallic ferromagnetism very similar to that in the virtual crystal case when one of the twelve ga in the unit cell is replaced by ge .",
    "the density of states is practically the same as in the virtual crystal calculation for this case . in the cell where one fe was replaced by co",
    ", we also find a density of states near the band edges that is similar to the undoped case and we find an upward shift of the fermi energy into the conduction band .",
    "we find therefore that co is an effective @xmath1-type dopant similar to ge and that the co - doped system shows near rigid band behavior .",
    "this is similar to what was found by haussermann and co - workers for pure coga@xmath0 in relation for fega@xmath0 , @xcite and is also in accord with the calculations of verchenko and co - workers .",
    "@xcite consistent with this we obtain a half metallic ferromagnetic state in this cell .",
    "this is in apparent disagreement with experiment , where it is reported that co substitution does not produce ferromagnetism in any amount .",
    "@xcite we do not know the reason for this disagreement .",
    "one possibility is that co favors another magnetic order ( not ferromagnetic ) .",
    "another possibility is that alloy disorder on the fe site induced by 25% co replacement is sufficiently strong to destroy the ferromagnetism ( this is neglected in our calculation , which uses an artificial perfect ordering of fe and co ) .",
    "related to this , it is possible that the presence of co - co dimers in the alloy , but not in the present calculation affects the behavior .",
    "finally , we note that bittar and co - workers observed that lower co concentrations @xmath35% substitution bring the system close to ferromagnetism based on the enhancement of the susceptibility .",
    "as mentioned , a scenario in which semiconducting fega@xmath0 is antiferromagnetic with pairs of fe atoms forming singlets was proposed by yin and pickett @xcite based on lda+@xmath15 calculations and subsequently criticized by oscorio - guillen and co - workers , @xcite based on theoretical considerations .",
    "arita and co - workers @xcite used photoemission and inverse photoemission experiments to investigate the electronic structure . they find that the spectra can be reproduced by lda+@xmath15 calculations using values of @xmath15 of @xmath33 ev .",
    "however , the density of states obtained is very similar between such calculations and @xmath15=0 density functional calculations .",
    "the data in relation to the calculations do not clearly distinguish the lda+@xmath15 and @xmath15=0 calculations , and as mentioned there are some other questions that arise with an explanation in terms of an antiferromagnetic ground state . in any case , we did additional calculations with various values of @xmath15 and different double counting schemes .",
    "we start with calculations with the fully localized limit ( sic ) double counting , similar to what was reported by yin and pickett .",
    "our pbe+@xmath15 calculations were done without spin orbit .",
    "first of all , we verified that there is no antiferromagnetic solution without @xmath15 . secondly , in calculations with the sic double counting we do find an antiferromagnetic solution in accord with what was reported by yin and pickett .",
    "we obtain a moment in the fe lapw sphere ( radius 2.05 bohr ) of 0.52 @xmath18 with @xmath16=1.4 ev , again in accord with yin and pickett ( who however do not state the sphere radius over which they integrated the moment ) .",
    "we also find that we can obtain an antiferromagnetic solution with the amf double counting , but that substantially higher @xmath16 is needed . at @xmath16=3",
    "ev the moment in the lapw sphere is still only 0.39 @xmath18 . also we do not find good local moment behavior .",
    "specifically , the moment vanishes for imposed ferromagnetic ordering with sic double counting and @xmath16=1.4 ev .",
    "this implies that @xmath15 is stabilizing a band structure driven antiferromagnet , which is not consistent with the assumptions of the fully localized limit .",
    "we note that there is no clear justification for adding @xmath15 in weak or moderately correlated transition metal compounds especially with this double counting scheme - a point that was emphasized by oscorio - guillen and co - workers .",
    "@xcite for example , fe metal is well described by standard density functionals , and agreement with experiment would be degraded if one performs @xmath54 calculations .    in any case , at higher",
    "@xmath16 we do obtain behavior that is closer to local moment in the sense that both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic solutions can be found , but the moments are high at that point , and clearly should have been seen in the susceptibility if present . for @xmath16=3.0 ev , we obtain a moment of 1.70 @xmath18 for the antiferromagnetic order and 1.43 @xmath18 for ferromagnetic .    for the amf double counting , while we do obtain an antiferromagnetic solution at @xmath16=3 ev , we do not obtain a ferromagnetic solution .",
    "this provides a resolution for the apparent discrepancy between the the results of yin and pickett and those of oscorio - guillen and co - workers , who considered ferromagnetic ordering via fixed spin moment calculations .",
    "thus it is possible to obtain small antiferromagnetic moments with pbe+@xmath15 calculations , but these are band structure related , inconsistent with the assumptions of the sic double counting . at higher @xmath15 where local moments are found , these are large , approaching 2 @xmath18 , inconsistent with experiment .",
    "we note that the use of sic double counting lda+@xmath15 calculations with low values of @xmath16 is rarely justified . clearly , it is not the case that there is a stable moment approximating spin 1/2 over a range of @xmath15 .",
    "rather , the value used by yin and pickett is a threshold value for the sic double counting where the fe begins a spin state transition and its moment rapidly increases with @xmath15 .",
    "this means that models based on spin 1/2 fe moments are not applicable for fega@xmath0 .",
    "this raises doubts about whether there are such static moments in undoped fega@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , as discussed above , we can obtain ferromagnetism in doped fega@xmath0 without assuming such pre - existing moments .",
    "neutron diffraction measurements for semiconducting fega@xmath0 should be sensitive to any ordered fe moments if present , in particular through symmetry lowering from the full @xmath20 spacegroup .",
    "in summary , we presented first principles calculations of the electronic structure and transport properties of fega@xmath0 .",
    "we find that modest electron or hole doping can produce itinerant ferromagnetism in this compound .",
    "this does not depend on the presence of pre - formed moments in the undoped semiconducting phase .",
    "it will be of interest to search experimentally for moments and to examine the nature of the ferromagnetic phase in more detail .",
    "itinerant magnetism implies strong coupling between the electrons at the fermi energy that control transport and the magnetism . as such , fega@xmath0 may be a particularly interesting material near a quantum critical point .",
    "we find that the ferromagnetic state is half metallic over a substantial composition range .",
    "the results also show some promise as a thermoelectric material at high temperature if the doping level is optimized .",
