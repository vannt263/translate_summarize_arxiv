    "the naive , nonrelativistic quark model ( nqm ) , even though very simple in its formalism , is qualitatively good in describing the magnetic moments of the octet baryons .",
    "it fits the pattern and the general magnitude of the octet baryon moments up to @xmath6 ( nuclear magnetons ) in average .",
    "the discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data are due to the hadrons having an internal structure with a dynamically intricate properties that the nqm has not accounted for . therefore , it is desirable to build a dynamical theory for the nqm .",
    "in fact , the nqm can be derived from qcd using the wilson loop approach @xcite . by calculating the gauge invariant green s function for a baryon interacting with an electromagnetic field and using well - defined approximations , such as the `` quenched '' approximation in which the internal virtual quark pair loops are not allowed and the minimal area law ,",
    "we have derived the quark model for moments plus semi relativistic corrections associated with the binding of the quarks in the baryon . a test of this qcd - based qm by fitting the octet baryon moments showed that the theory failed to give any substantial improvement in the qm moments .",
    "the problem was identifed with the quenched approximation @xcite .    to go beyond the quenched approximation",
    ", we have developed an loop expansion approach for the qcd - based qm and studied the octet baryon moments using our newly developed approach @xcite .",
    "our calculation is based on the heavy baryon perturbation theory in which the chiral baryon - meson couplings and the meson - meson - photon couplings from the chiral perturbation theory together with the qm moment couplings are used .",
    "it also involves the introduction of a single form factor characterizing the structure of the baryons considered as composite particles .",
    "the form factor reflects soft wave function effects with characteristic momenta at a scale @xmath7 mev , well below the chiral cutoff @xmath8 gev .",
    "we chose the strong interaction coupling constants in the chiral baryon - meson couplings to satisfy the su(6 ) relations @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 as would be expected for the @xmath12 qm states .",
    "our theory is convergent and has only three free parameters , the effective quark moments @xmath13 , and the wave function parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the last is constrained by theory and experiment .",
    "in contrast the usual approaches to magnetic moments through chpt @xcite involve seven parameters in the description of the octet moments at one loop .",
    "if these parameters are used in fitting the seven measured octet moments , the effects of dynamical loop corrections appear only in the prediction for the @xmath15 transition moment , where they are small @xcite .",
    "we found in @xcite that combining the dynamical corrections from the loop expansion with those associated with the binding of quarks in baryon significantly improved the agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of the baryon magnetic moments .",
    "the average deviation from fitting the seven well - measured octet magnetic moments excluding the transition moment @xmath16 , is @xmath17 , a substantial improvement on the qm . we concluded that the loop expansion is an effective way of going beyond quenched approximation in the octet baryon magnetic moment problem .    in this paper",
    ", we study the decuplet baryon magnetic moments using the same method .",
    "our way of evaluating the semi relativistic corrections associated with the binding of quarks in the baryon and the choice of the strong interaction coupling constants and the octet - decuplet mass difference are the same for both octet and decuplet .",
    "we can therefore evaluate the decuplet moments using the quark moments @xmath13 , and the wave function parameter @xmath14 obtained in fitting the octet baryon moments , and predict the decuplet moments .",
    "in particular , the decuplet moment @xmath1 is predicted to be @xmath18 compared to the experimental result of ( @xmath32.02 @xmath4 0.05 ) @xmath5 .",
    "the loop corrections are again small in comparison to the leading terms , and the contributions from the decuplet intermediate states are substantial in comparison to those from the octet intermediate states for some baryons .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly describes loop expansion approach .",
    "an expression of the decuplet baryon magnetic moments are given in sec .",
    "iii , where some numerical results of calculating the decuplet baryon moments are also presented .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "iv . all the necessary formulae for the decuplet baryon moments can be found in the appendices .",
    "going beyond the quenched approximation in the qcd - based qm means that we have to develop an approach for studying the meson loop effects in the qcd - based qm .",
    "we also need to take the composite structure of the baryons into account .",
    "this is already included in the calculation of the qcd binding effects , but must also be included in the loop calculations . for that purpose , we introduce a single form factor characterizing the structure of the @xmath12 baryons considered as composite particles .",
    "we base our loop calculations on heavy baryon perturbation theory ( hbpt ) and use , together with the qm moment couplings , chiral couplings for the low momentum couplings of mesons to baryons .",
    "that is , the couplings of the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) are used where chiral baryon - meson couplings and the meson - meson - electromagnetic field couplings are invoked , but the actual calculation of the loop graphs is modified with respect to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hbchpt , which has been used to study the hadronic processes of momentum transfers much less than 1 gev , is well described in refs .",
    "@xcite . let us consider a heavy baryon interacting with a low momentum meson .",
    "the velocity of the baryon is nearly unchanged when it exchanges some small momentum with the meson .",
    "then , a nearly on - shell baryon with velocity @xmath19 has momentum    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the baryon mass , and @xmath22 .",
    "the effective heavy baryon theory is written in terms of baryon fields @xmath23 with definite velocity @xmath19 , which are related to the original baryon fields by @xcite    @xmath24    the new baryon fields obey a modified dirac equation ,    @xmath25    the chiral lagrangian for baryon fields depends on the pseudoscalar meson octet    @xmath26    which couples to the baryon fields through the vector and axial vector currents defined by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 mev is the meson decay constant .",
    "we will retain , as shown above , only leading term in the derivative expansion .",

    ". we can construct these using @xmath23 , @xmath32 , and the moment operator @xmath40 diag @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "for example , the qm decuplet magnetic moment operator is    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are su(3 ) flavor indices . in a momentum space , after doing a calculation on the flavor indices , we find that this operator reproduces the qm decuplet moments @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the photon momentum and the spin dependent factor @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 the @xmath51 s are defined and the factor is evaluated in appendix a using the heavy baryon spin structure states .",
    "note that the decuplet @xmath51 s are now having the dirac , spin and lorentz indices only , @xmath52 . the dirac index @xmath53 and spin index are suppressed .",
    "the qm decuplet moments @xmath54 are @xmath55 the decuplet - octet transition magnetic moment operator is chosen as    @xmath56    which gives the decuplet - octet transition moments @xmath57 that are the same as the qm results except for a change in sign of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this difference comes from a difference choice of the phases of the baryon fields , and does not affect to the calculations of the loop corrections for the baryon magnetic moments .",
    "for investigating the meson wave function effects on the baryon moments , we introduce at each vertex with a meson line a form factor @xmath60 defined in the rest frame of the heavy baryon by    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the 4-momentum of meson and @xmath14 is a parameter characterizing a natural momentum scale for the wave function , expected to be much below 1 gev . the form factor defined as in eq .",
    "( [ formf ] ) is normalized at chiral limit when * k * is set equal to zero . with the introduction of this form factor ,",
    "all the feynman integrals give finite contributions .",
    "we therefore have a convergent theory in which the counterterms characteristic of loop calculations in chpt are no longer necessary .    our method for evaluating the feynman integrals from the loop graphs ( figs .",
    "[ fig : sqloop ] and [ fig : logloop ] ) with the form factors inserted is as follows .",
    "first , we rewrite the form factor ( [ formf ] ) in terms of @xmath63 and @xmath19 as @xmath64 then , using the feynman parametrization formula , we combine the factors in the denominator for the loop graph into a general form @xmath65 where @xmath53 and @xmath66 are parameters independent of the integral variables @xmath45 , and the vector @xmath67 is any combination of @xmath68 and the photon momentum @xmath48 . at this point , by changing variables to @xmath69 and choosing @xmath70 , we can get rid of the @xmath71 term in the denominator . eq.([deno ] ) becomes @xmath72 where the vector @xmath73 is also any combination of @xmath68 and @xmath48 .",
    "the feynman integrals with the intergrands containing the denominators of this type are easily evaluated .",
    "note that the jacobian of the transformation of variables ( eq.([transf ] ) ) is @xmath74 .",
    "the calculation of the loop graphs shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sqloop ] and [ fig : logloop ] is straightforward .",
    "the main difficulty is in the calculation of the `` group coefficients '' that arise from the products of couplings .",
    "these algebraic calculations were done using mathematica and checked with some group coefficients given in @xcite .",
    "the results are given in appendix b. we will only give the final expressions for the decuplet baryon magnetic moments . in units of nuclear magnetons , an expression of baryon moments is given by    @xmath75    where @xmath76 are the contributions from the lowest loop order .",
    "these include the qm moments plus the corrections @xmath77 from the qcd - based qm .",

    "it is straightforward to get @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 from these expressions given , and such an example is shown in appendix c. to have an idea which corrections come from which loop graphs ( figs .

    "now we are ready to evaluate the decuplet baryon magnetic moments .",
    "as done in the octet moment case , the corrections @xmath77 from the qcd - based qm are calculated using the values of @xmath98 s and @xmath99 s given in @xcite .",
    "again , for the loop corrections , the coupling constants @xmath34 , @xmath33 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 were chosen such that @xmath100 ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the axial vector and vector coupling constants , respectively ) and the @xmath103 relations between the coupling constants @xmath104 , and @xmath10 are satisfied , as expected for @xmath12 baryons .",
    "we also choose the decuplet - octet mass difference @xmath105 mev and @xmath106 mev , @xmath107 .",
    "the remaining three parameters @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and the natural cutoff @xmath14 are given the values that give the best fit in the octet moment case , namely @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 mev .",
    "we give our calculated values for the decuplet baryon magnetic moments , and the corresponding values from the nqm , in table i and a detailed breakdown of the contributions of the loop integrals to the magnetic moments in table ii .",
    "we find that the _ predicted _ decuplet moment @xmath113 is in very good agreement with the experimental result of ( @xmath32.02 @xmath4 0.05 ) @xmath5 , and the theoretical value of @xmath114 falls within the experimental range ( from 3.7 to 7.5 in unit of nuclear magnetons )    as in the octet case , again we see that the loop contributions are small in comparison to the tree level or qm terms , that the contributions from the graphs involving the intermediate decuplet states ( sum of the graphs 1a , 2a , 2c , 2d , and 2e ) are substantial . for some baryons ,",
    "those contributions are even larger than those from the graphs involving only the intermediate octet states .",
    "in this paper , we have extended our earlier calculations of the octet baryon moments in a qcd - based qm with loop corrections to include the decuplet baryon magnetic moments .",
    "we have predicted the decuplet moments using the input parameters obtained from studying the octet baryon moments .",
    "we find that our predicted decuplet moment @xmath1 is in very good agreement with its experimental value .",
    "again , we have shown that our loop approach for baryon magnetic moments in a qcd - based qm works .",
    "the loop corrections extend our qcd - based qm beyond the quenched approximation .",
    "the resulting theory describes the baryon magnetic moments much better than the nqm .",
    "it can fit the seven observed octet baryon magnetic moments up to about 0.05@xmath5 in average magnitude , gives a result for the @xmath15 transition moment consistent with experiment , and predicts @xmath1 very well .",
