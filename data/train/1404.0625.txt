    "<S> we report experimental evidence of a remarkable spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking in two dimensional electron systems formed by atomically confined doping of phosphorus ( p ) atoms inside bulk crystalline silicon ( si ) and germanium ( ge ) . weak localization corrections to the conductivity and the universal conductance fluctuations were both found to decrease rapidly with decreasing doping in the si : p and ge : p @xmath0layers , suggesting an effect driven by coulomb interactions . </S>",

    "<S> we show that strong coulomb interactions can also lift the time reversal symmetry in nonmagnetic 2d systems at zero magnetic field .    while bulk p - doped si and ge have been extensively studied in the context of electron localization in three dimensions  @xcite , confining the dopants to one or few atomic planes ( @xmath0layers ) of the host semiconductor has recently led to a new class of 2d electron system  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we show evidence of spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry in 2d si : p and ge : p @xmath4-layers as the on - site effective coulomb interaction is increased by decreasing the doping density of p atoms . </S>",
    "<S> quantum transport and noise experiments indicate a strong suppression of quantum interference effects at low doping densities . </S>",

    "<S> it is important to note that a major shift in the dominant dephasing mechanism in the lightly doped samples is ruled out because we find @xmath56 to be similar in magnitude in all three devices , and @xmath59 down to @xmath60  k ( fig .  s2 in si ) . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the predominance of the electron - electron scattering mediated dephasing which has been reported earlier in such @xmath4-layers  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the reduced quantum correction can not be due to finite experimental range ( @xmath61  t ) of @xmath22 , which exceeds both @xmath24 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , the upper cutoff field due to momentum relaxation ) by factors of @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively even for the least doped devices at @xmath23  k ( table i in si ) . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit interaction is also known to be small for p - doped ( bulk ) si and ge  @xcite , and independent of the density of the dopants . </S>",
    "<S> any long range magnetic order is also unlikely because the hall resistance was found to vary linearly with @xmath44 at all @xmath36 ( see si , section s7 ) in all our devices  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of quantum correction to conductivity has been observed in low density electron gases in si mosfets near the apparent mit  @xcite although its microscopic origin remains unclear with both temperature dependant screening of disorder and interaction driven spin fluctuations suggested as competing mechanisms . </S>",

    "<S> the logarithmic increase in the magnetoconductivity at large @xmath39 , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> importantly , the experimental value of @xmath104 was found to be a factor of @xmath31 smaller than that expected theoretically ( assuming @xmath105 ) , suggesting that the impact of local moments on the dephasing process is anomalously small .    </S>",
    "<S> the compelling analogy with the bulk p - doped si close to mit provides a `` two - fluid '' framework to address transport in our @xmath4-layers . </S>",
    "<S> this consists of itinerant electrons in disordered hamiltonian and local magnetic moments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the local moments and itinerant electrons suppresses localization , although the spin - scattering process is quasi - elastic ( energy exchange @xmath106 ) , causing only minor modification to the dephasing mechanism ( as confirmed by the linear @xmath36 dependence of @xmath107 in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> 1d , eq .  [ deltasigma_total ] describes the magnetoconductivity very well over the entire range of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit parameter @xmath114 , provides an estimate of the spin scattering time @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> we note the following : ( i ) as evident in fig .  4d , @xmath96 is more than ten times larger than experimentally measured @xmath107 ( see si ) , confirming that the spin - scattering is mostly elastic . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) second , @xmath96 varies nonmonotonically with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the filled squares represent @xmath96 analyzed from data of ref  @xcite . at low @xmath7 , @xmath116 irrespective of host material , disorder or carrier mobility , indicating that the number of local spins are only related with the number of p dopant sites . </S>",

    "<S> 4e ) , in accordance with the two - fluid model , shows a power law variation as @xmath118 , with @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> this sets the exponent for susceptibilty and specific heat divergence in the @xmath4-layers to be @xmath120 , which is about half of that observed in the bulk si : p close to mit  @xcite .    finally , to estimate the fraction of p - dopants that host a local moment , we compare the estimated @xmath96 in lightly doped si_ld </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath121  @xmath17 ) with ( 1 ) the total momentum relaxation rate @xmath122  s@xmath123 from the experimental drude conductivity , although this involves scattering from neutral defects as well , and ( 2 ) calculated momentum relaxation rate ( @xmath124  s@xmath123 ) expected purely from the p - dopants ( charged impurities ) ( see calculation details in ref  @xcite and si , section s6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a bound between @xmath125 of the p - dopants to host local moments which is consistent with the fraction expected for half - filled impurity bands in bulk si : p  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , while the weak localization correction is reduced only partially (  30% in si_ld ) , the ucf noise due to the cooperons is completely suppressed for the weakly doped devices . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that because the ucf noise involves interference between two feynman propagators , it is more likely to be affected by the localized spins than the wl correction which is determined by a single self intersecting propagator . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have not discussed spatial inhomogeneity or clustering in the distribution of dopants which can lead to coexistence of localized and delocalized phases  @xcite , impact of multiple valleys  @xcite , or the inter - site coulomb interaction  @xcite which are unlikely to affect the time reversal symmetry .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> magnetoconductivity and noise measurements reveal an unexpected spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry in 2d electron systems hosted in atomically confined si : p and ge : p crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the universal conductance fluctuations and in - plane magnetoconductivity suggest that local spin fluctuations in the presence of strong coulomb interaction play an important role in the lifting the time reversal symmetry . whether this indeed leads to a true interaction - induced metallic ground state in two dimensions needs further experimental and theoretical exploration . </S>"
