    "<S> the last decade has seen numerous efforts to achieve imaging resolution beyond that of the abbe - rayleigh diffraction limit , which proscribes the visualization of features smaller than about half of the wavelength of light with optical instruments . </S>",
    "<S> the main direction of research aiming to break this limit seeks to exploit the evanescent components containing fine detail of the electromagnetic field distribution . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , many powerful concepts like scanning near - field optical microscopy ( snom ) @xcite , the use of various forms of field concentrators @xcite and superlenses @xcite depend on the exploitation or recovery of evanescent fields . </S>",
    "<S> the proper far - field optical superlens @xcite requires bulk negative index materials that are still to be developed , while other designs , though offering substantial advances , are united by a common severe limitation : that the object being imaged or stimulated must be in the immediate proximity of the superlens or field concentrator . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a solution that removes this limitation : an optical mask can be designed that creates constructive interference of waves known as superoscillation , leading to a sub - wavelength focus of prescribed size and shape in a ` field of view ' beyond the evanescent fields , when illuminated by a monochromatic wave . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate that such a mask may be used not only as a focusing device , but also as a super - resolution imaging device .    in fact , in his seminal 1952 paper toraldo di francia demonstrated that propagating waves can create sub - wavelength localization of light in the far - field with the suggestion of a pupil design providing an accurately tailored sub - wavelength diffraction spot using a series of concentric apertures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a sub - wavelength concentrator could be employed as a focusing device in a super - resolution scanning optical microscope where the object is placed several wavelengths away from the device , thus removing the main limitation of near - field instruments . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , berry and popescu @xcite , starting from earlier works on quantum mechanics , showed that diffraction on a grating structure could create sub - wavelength localizations of light that propagate further into the far field than more familiar evanescent waves . </S>",
    "<S> they relate this effect to the fact that band - limited functions are able to oscillate arbitrarily faster than the highest fourier components they contain , a phenomenon now known as superoscillation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> examples of sub - wavelength localizations of light generated by a nano - hole array @xcite and a thin meta - dielectric shell @xcite have been demonstrated recently . </S>",
    "<S> research on beating the diffraction limit actually has an even longer history : in 1922 , oseen , with reference to einstein s radiation ` needle stick ' , proved that a substantial fraction of the emitted electromagnetic energy can be sent into an arbitrarily small solid angle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> beginning from the pioneering work of shelkunoff @xcite , the microwave community contemplated the idea of achieving antennae that beat the diffraction limit for directivity : several authors were able to prove that for a linear array of properly adjusted radiating antenna dipoles , there were no theoretical limits to directivity whatsoever @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sharp increase in the proportion of reactive to radiated power that would be required to achieve super - directivity means that the antenna gain increase is offset by the need to provide an even higher increase in the power to the antenna to maintain the signal level , thus rendering the concept of super - directive antennae impractical . as we will see below , achieving a sub - wavelength localization of light in the far - field also comes at a price of losing most of the optical energy into diffuse sidebands . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , optical microscopy applications can tolerate much higher losses than those acceptable in antenna design : scanning microscopes can work with only a few photons per second , giving one around 19 orders of magnitude of power reserve ( assuming that a 1 w laser is used as the optical source ) .    </S>",
    "<S> , within a limited area @xmath0 $ ] , can be generated by diffraction of a plane electromagnetic wave from a purposely designed mask.,width=302 ]    in this letter we make a further step in the investigation of the potential of superoscillation for imaging and achieving sub - wavelength foci . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an algorithm for designing a mask that creates a sub - wavelength focus of prescribed size and shape within a prescribed ` field of view ' when illuminated by a monochromatic wave . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that such a mask may be used not only as a focusing device , but also as a super - resolution imaging tool . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the role of manufacturing imperfections on the achievable super - resolution and suggest a design for a superoscillation plasmonic energy concentrator .    the typical situation that we address here </S>",
    "<S> is presented in fig.[configuration ] : we aim to design a mask which , within a limited area @xmath0 $ ] ( field of view ) , will create a small hot - spot of light concentration ( superoscillation ) with a width @xmath1 located outside the evanescent zone , at a distance @xmath2 from the mask , where @xmath3 is the wavelength of light illuminating the mask . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that in principle a mask can be designed to create a hot - spot that is arbitrarily small , with an arbitrary profile , located at any given distance from the mask .     </S>",
    "<S> = @xmath4 ( black dotted line ) and its approximations by series of bandwidth - limited prolate spheroidal wave functions @xmath5 truncated at : @xmath6 ( red line , @xmath7=@xmath8 ) ; @xmath9 ( blue line , @xmath10=@xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 ( pink line , @xmath13=@xmath14 ) ; @xmath15 ( green line , @xmath16 = @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line shows the @xmath17 limit for a hot - spot achievable with a high - numerical aperture cylindrical lens . </S>",
    "<S> insert : energy ( @xmath18 ) contained within the hot - spot as a function of its size ( @xmath1),width=302 ]    our consideration is limited to a one - dimensional mask @xmath19 creating a one - dimensional sub - wavelength field distribution @xmath20 ( superoscillation ) when illuminated by plane wave at wavelength @xmath3 , although generalization to a two - dimensional case is trivial . the desired superoscillation feature located at a distance from the near - field zone of the mask </S>",
    "<S> can only be created by diffraction on the mask if the feature can be decomposed into a series of plane waves with wave - vector @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the main step in designing the mask is to present the desired superoscillating field as a series of bandwidth limited functions that can be decomposed into free - space plane waves of the given wavelength @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that _ any _ arbitrary small field feature can be presented as a series of _ band - limited _ functions if we are concerned with a prescribed ` field of view ' @xmath22 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this may be achieved using the formulism of prolate spheroidal wave functions developed by slepian and pollark @xcite to treat problems of information compression . </S>",
    "<S> this is a complete set of functions orthogonal in the interval @xmath22 $ ] and across the whole range @xmath23 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of prolate spheroidal wave functions is that they are _ band - limited _ to a frequency domain @xmath24 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the mask design algorithm comprises the following steps : initially the desired sub - wavelength hot - spot is presented as a series of prolate spheroidal wave functions , which can be truncated when a satisfactory level of approximation is achieved ; at the second step this series of prolate spheroidal wave functions is presented as a series of plane waves and , using the scalar angular spectrum description of light propagating from the mask to the super - oscillating feature , the required complex mask transmission function @xmath19 can be readily derived . </S>",
    "<S> the formulism of the algorithm is presented in the appendix .     </S>",
    "<S> ( blue line ) and phase @xmath25 ( red lines ) profiles of the mask transmission function @xmath19 , which generates a hot - spot with @xmath1 = @xmath11 at a distance @xmath26 from the grating . at the bottom , a grey - scale map of the intensity profile is also presented . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) shows close - up detail of kinks in the phase curve at the points highlighted with arrows in ( a).,width=302 ]    in what follows , we will give an explicit example of a mask designed to generate a sub - wavelength concentration of light . </S>",
    "<S> let us aim for a single hot - spot field distribution @xmath27 centered in the ` field of view ' @xmath0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the full width at half maximum @xmath1 of the intensity profile of this distribution is measured as @xmath28 . from now on we will set @xmath29 , aiming therefore to achieve a @xmath30 hot spot in a @xmath31 field of view , far beyond the abbe - rayleigh limit . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the intensity profile of this distribution alongside a number of consecutive approximations to the distribution formed by limited series of prolate spheroidal wave functions , and a curve representing the abbe - rayleigh limit that would be achievable by a high - numerical aperture cylindrical lens . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the series rapidly converges and that when @xmath15 the width of the approximation is practically the same as that of the target field distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.3 shows the intensity @xmath32 and phase @xmath33 profiles of the mask @xmath34 required to create the field profile corresponding to @xmath9 , which has @xmath1 = @xmath11 , at a distance @xmath26 from the grating . as the mask transmission function is even , only part of profile for @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> is shown here . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that there is a small central area @xmath36 $ ] of the mask that transmits most of light . beyond that area </S>",
    "<S> , there is a low - intensity broad shoulder of a slowly fading transmission characteristic . </S>",
    "<S> the phase profile of the mask resembles that of a concave lens where the optical thickness is at a minimum in the centre . </S>",
    "<S> the monotonous increase is only interrupted at a few positions where transmission amplitude is close to zero ( indicated by arrows ) and the phase shows a kink as illustrated in the zoomed sections @xmath37 .     </S>",
    "<S> mimics the manufacturing pixelation . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) calculated intensity profiles of hot - spots generated by an ideal infinitely long mask ( black line ) ; an ideal mask truncated to a length of @xmath38 ( red line ) ; and @xmath38 long masks pixelated to @xmath39 ( cyan line ) , @xmath40 ( blue line ) , @xmath41 ( green line ) and @xmath42 ( pink line).,width=302 ]    , located at a distance @xmath43 from the mask . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity distribution is also shown in gray - scale at the bottom of the image where the dotted lines indicate the positions of the two slits . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the dashed line shows the intensity profile of the image field of the two slits as seen imaged by a conventional cylindrical lens with unitary numerical aperture and a resolution of @xmath17.,width=302 ]    the superoscillation process is based on the precise and delicate interference of waves , so we investigated its stability with respect to the manufacturing tolerances to which masks can be fabricated and to the need to use masks of finite length ( see the description of the practical device design below ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for the mask presented in fig .  3 an @xmath38 long device may be used instead of an infinitely long mask without any substantial degradation of performance ( @xmath1= @xmath11 for both infinite and truncated masks with a 5% intensity decrease for the finite mask ) . </S>",
    "<S> a practical mask is likely to be manufactured by electron - beam lithography with a certain limited resolution , so we also investigated the dependence of superoscillation hot - spot size and intensity on the pixelation of the grating design : we replaced the smooth transmission function with a stepped functions in which the step width corresponded to the resolution @xmath44 of the manufacturing process ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b shows the variation of the intensity profile with increasing pixelation . </S>",
    "<S> the superoscillation process is remarkably stable against this manufacturing imperfection : with pixel size increasing to @xmath45 , the @xmath1 width of the hot - spot only increases by about 8% . </S>",
    "<S> pixelation has a more substantial influence on the peak intensity , which is reduced by about 40% under such conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> to quantitatively characterize the optical energy contained in a superoscillating hot - spot , we define @xmath18 as the ratio between the energy contained in the hot - spot ( between the first intensity minima either side of the central peak ) and the total energy transmitted through the mask . in the inset to fig.[super ] </S>",
    "<S> we show values of @xmath18 against the width of the peak @xmath1 for different levels of approximation @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly see that the smaller the hot - spot is , the lower the proportion of energy that goes into it . for example , for @xmath9 only @xmath47 of the total transmitted energy will be focused into the hot - spot . the energy contained in the hot - spot is also significantly dependent on the field of view : if the required field of view is decreased by a factor of two from @xmath31 to @xmath48 , the proportion of energy going into the hot - spot at @xmath9 increases by nearly three orders of magnitude to @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a more general consideration of the super - oscillating functions shows that the intensity in the hot - spot may only decrease polynomially with its width @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore argue that when designing practical realizations of super - oscillating masks , less demanding requirements on the shape of hot - spots may yield much higher values of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one may achieve much higher values of @xmath18 for a given size of hot - spot by relaxing the requirements on the field structure of the hot - spot ` pedestal ' ( the background level within the field of view ) , for instance by stipulating only the maximum field intensity in the pedestal area relative to that of the hot - spot , but not the exact profile of the pedestal .    </S>",
    "<S> recently it was shown that a hole array can be used as an imaging device @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a super - oscillating mask can also be designed to image a sub - wavelength object . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 where we show a mask with a transmission function that converts an object located @xmath43 from the mask to an image on the opposite side of the mask , also at @xmath43 ( see formula @xmath50 of the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) illustrates the imaging of two incoherent slit sources ( each @xmath51 wide ) separated by a distance of @xmath52 . here </S>",
    "<S> the slits are clearly resolved according to the rayleigh criterion @xcite , which state that the total intensity at the saddle point of the sum intensity profile of two just - resolved slit sources is 81% of the maximum intensity .    regarding practical implementations of the superoscillating mask , </S>",
    "<S> the above calculations demonstrate that manufacturing tolerance should be of the order of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , manufacturing such a phase mask from a slab of dielectric material for microwave and thz frequency focusing should not be a very challenging problem . </S>",
    "<S> it can then be covered with an absorbing film of variable thickness to create the desired transmission profile . </S>",
    "<S> fabricating such a mask for the ir and optical parts of the spectrum presents a more significant challenge and a fabrication accuracy of between @xmath54 and @xmath55 nm will be required . </S>",
    "<S> however , even such challenging phase masks may be created from glass with the diamond milling techniques used to produce aspheric lenses , while further fine - tuning with true nanoscale resolution may be achieved using focusing ion beam milling . here </S>",
    "<S> the absorbing part of the mask could be a metal film of variable density prepared by uv or e - beam lithography .        </S>",
    "<S> the idea of superoscillation could also be applied to the creation of a super - high - resolution plasmonic device . </S>",
    "<S> surface plasmon - polaritons are collective oscillations of light and electrons that propagate along the interface between a metal ( e.g. gold , silver ) and a dielectric . </S>",
    "<S> they are essentially two - dimensional waves that can create complex field patterns by interference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as plasmon wavelengths are somewhat shorter than those of light at the same frequency , plasmonic devices promise better resolution than optical devices even within the conventional abbe - rayleigh diffraction limit . we argue that this may be enhanced even further through the use of superoscillation as the approach developed above may be easily applied to plasmons . </S>",
    "<S> a possible implementation of a plasmonic focusing device is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6 . here , </S>",
    "<S> in order to create a desired intensity and phase profile of the mask we exploit the fact that the complex refractive index for plasmons depends on the dielectric properties @xmath56 of the medium forming an interface with the metal @xcite : @xmath57 . by preparing a film of lossless dielectric on a metal surface with a prescribed profile </S>",
    "<S> , one can create the desired phase profile for the plasmon mask . using an additional lossy profiled dielectric layer on the top of the first the necessary intensity profile can be engineered . here the transmission function of the surface plasmon mask should be derived taking account of losses ( see appendix , formula a7 ) .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that an optical mask can be designed that creates a a sub - wavelength focus in an area beyond the evanescent fields . </S>",
    "<S> such a mask may also be used as a super - resolution imaging device with numerous applications for instance for imaging inside a leaving cell which is impossible with a near - field device .    </S>",
