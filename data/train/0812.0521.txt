    "in the early universe prior to recombination , the free electrons couple the baryons to the photons through coulomb and compton interactions , so these three species move together as a single fluid .",

    "the memory of these baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) still remain after the epoch of recombination .",
    "the baos leave their imprints through the propagating of photons on the last scattering surface and produce a harmonic series of maxima and minima in the anisotropy power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , due to the significant fraction of baryons in the universe , baos can also be imprinted onto the late - time power spectrum of the non - relativistic matter @xcite , which have been detected in the large - scale correlation function of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminous red galaxies @xcite , and the power spectrum of @xmath3 cm emission generated from the neutral hydrogen from the epoch of reionization through the underlying density perturbation @xcite .",
    "essentially , the baos can give rise to the wiggles in the matter power spectrum of large scale structure during the evolution of the universe .",
    "gravitational lensing can directly reveal the strenth of gravitational clustering@xcite , and weak gravitational lensing is the direct measurement of the projected mass distribution of the large - scale structure .",
