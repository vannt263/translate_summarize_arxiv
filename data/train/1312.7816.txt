    "* _ does the covariogram determine a convex body , among all convex bodies , up to translations and reflections ? _",
    "the answer to the covariogram problem is positive for every planar convex body ( see averkov and bianchi  @xcite ) , it is positive for convex polytopes in @xmath20 ( see bianchi  @xcite ) but the case of a general convex body in @xmath20 is still open , and in every dimension @xmath21 there are examples of nondetermination , as well as positive results in some subclasses of the class of convex bodies ( see goodey , schneider and weil  @xcite , bianchi  @xcite ) .",
    "the _ phase retrieval problem _ asks for the determination of a function @xmath22 with compact support from the knowledge of the modulus of its of fourier transform @xmath23 for @xmath3 , up to the inherent ambiguities . in view of the fourier",
    "transform of @xmath5 coincides with @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the covariogram problem coincides with a particular instance of the phase retrieval problem where the unknown function @xmath25 is the characteristic function of a convex body and this function has to be determined by the modulus of its fourier transform within the class of characteristic functions of convex bodies .",
    "the fourier - laplace transform plays an important role in the uniqueness aspects of the phase retrieval problem .",
    "when @xmath22 has compact support then @xmath26 is an entire function ( i.e. is holomorphic on the entire @xmath10 ) .",
    "sanz and huang @xcite , barakat and newsam  @xcite and stefanescu  @xcite prove that the non - uniqueness in the determination is related to the possibility of factoring @xmath26 as the product of two non - trivial entire functions .",
    "what is the significance of these results for the covariogram problem ?",
    "_ is it possible to find explicit geometric conditions on a convex body @xmath1 that grant that @xmath7 can not be factored ? _",
    "this seems to be a difficult problem .",
    "for instance the subproblem consisting in understanding for which @xmath1 the function @xmath7 can be factored as the product of a polynomial @xmath27 and of an entire function is equivalent to understanding for which @xmath1 a certain differential problem has a solution with compact support @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath28 this problem has been studied in many papers , because proving that a solution to this problem exists for some @xmath29 only if @xmath1 is a ball is equivalent to the famous pompeiu problem , a long - standing open problem in integral geometry . in section  [ sec_phase_retr ]",
    "we explain all this in detail .",
    "in this paper we use different aspects of the fourier - laplace transform .",
    "the zero set @xmath30 has been studied extensively , both for the role that it plays in attempts to solve the pompeiu problem ( see , for instance , berenstein  @xcite and garofalo and segala  @xcite ) and to understand which geometric information it carries ( see benguria et al .",
    "@xcite , kobayashi  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , kobayashi  @xcite studies the asymptotic behavior at infinity of this zero set in the case of a @xmath31 convex body ( the subscript @xmath32 means that @xmath33 is assumed to have gauss curvature positive everywhere ) , and relates this behavior to the width function of @xmath1 and to the gauss curvature of @xmath33 .",

    "we are interested in the consequences of this study for the covariogram problem . to this end",
    "we first prove kobayashi s result under lower regularity assumptions ( see theorem  [ teo_kobayashi_cm ] for the precise statement ) .",

    "however , a priori the reflection that makes   valid may vary from component to component .",
    "an important difference between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , something which has been used in overcoming this difficulty in @xmath57 , is the fact that in the plane implies that a portion of @xmath58 is a translation of a portion of @xmath33 , while this is not true anymore in @xmath2 when @xmath56 .",
    "kobayashi s result is the key to prove that the reflection that makes   valid does not vary from component to component . in order to explain this we observe that  , with @xmath59 , implies @xmath60 ( the bar denotes conjugation ) because @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath62 determining @xmath1 from @xmath5 can be proved equivalent to resolve the ambiguity in determining @xmath63 from @xmath64 . in this context",

    "we have to prove that this reflection of @xmath9 does not vary from component to component . the key ingredient in proving",
    "this fact when the body is regular enough is the description of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath63 given in kobayashi s theorem  [ teo_kobayashi ] and the analyticity of the maps involved in this description .",
    "kobayashi s theorem  [ teo_kobayashi ] and our extension theorem  [ teo_kobayashi_cm ] enable us to prove also a result regarding the equivalent of the covariogram problem for the cross - covariogram .",
