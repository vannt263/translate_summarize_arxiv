    "the near - infrared color excess of extincted background stars can reveal the dust distribution in a dense core and provide information on physical structure .",
    "historically , this technique has been hampered in small , dense regions by limited instrumental sensitivity ( jones et al .",
    "1980 , 1984 ) , but the development of large format array cameras has sparked renewed interest ( lada et al .",
    "1994 , alves et al .",
    "1998 , lada , alves & lada 1999 , alves , lada & lada 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "the unprecedented sensitivity available with the near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer ( nicmos ) instrument on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) opens up a new regime .",
    "in particular , the high extinctions of dense cores that form the immediate environs of candidate low mass protostars are now accessible .",
    "molecular line surveys of nearby dark clouds have identified a large number of low mass dense cores ( myers , linke & benson 1983 ) of which roughly half are associated with young stellar objects detected by _ iras _ ( beichman et al .  1986 ) .",
    "these observations have contributed to the general paradigm that at least some low - mass stars like the sun form by the gravitational collapse of isolated , dense cores . in the standard theory , originating with shu ( 1977 ) , the dynamical collapse to a star / disk system occurs from the inside - out .",
    "first , an @xmath4 distribution is established prior to collapse as the cloud core loses magnetic and turbulent support through ambipolar diffusion and relaxes to a balance between gravity and thermal pressure .",
    "collapse is initiated at the center where the density is highest , and a wave of infall propagates outward at the sound speed .",
    "conditions inside the infall radius asymptotically approach free - fall , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "modifications to the simple theory have been made to account for more realistic initial conditions , including slow rotation ( tereby , shu & cassen 1984 ) and residual magnetic fields ( galli & shu 1993 , li & shu 1997 ) .",
    "a similar radial density profile is also produced by the competing self - similar collapse theory of larson ( 1969 ) and penston ( 1969 ) .",
    "however , the larson - penston flow predicts far larger infall velocities than the shu theory , and has proved unsuccessful at explaining molecular line observations ( see e.g.  zhou 1992 ) .",
    "unambigous identification of inside - out collapse motions has proved difficult for several reasons .",
    "first , the fact that collapse initiates in the center of a core means that it can be detected only with observations of sufficiently high angular resolution .",
    "further difficulty comes from the fact that the velocities associated with infall motions are small , comparable to intrinsic line widths and much smaller than the velocities of the bipolar outflows powered by young stellar objects .",
    "the presence of localized , redshifted self - absorption in spectral lines of moderate optical depth provides one signature of infall motions , but this signature is not unique .",
    "scenarios other than collapse can produce the same spectral line profiles .",
    "the most promising claims for collapse have been inferred from redshifted self - absorption , and consequently these claims are often controversial ( see the review of myers , evans & ohashi 2000 ) .",
    "the dense core in the b335 region is generally recognized as the best protostellar collapse candidate .",
    "the b335 region contains an isolated , roughly spherical globule at a distance of roughly 250  pc ( tomita , saito & ohtani 1979 ) .",
    "deeply embedded in the globule is a young stellar object discovered at far - infrared wavelengths by keene et al.(1983 ) and detected only at @xmath7 m by",
    "_ iras_. observations of high velocity molecular line emission have shown that the young stellar object drives a bipolar outflow with semi - opening angle of @xmath8 ( cabrit , goldsmith & snell 1988 , hirano et al .",
    "1988 , 1992 ) .",
    "detailed radiative transfer models based on the theory of inside - out collapse provide good fits to many molecular line profiles of dense gas tracers observed at @xmath9@xmath10 resolution ( zhou et al .",
    "1993 , choi et al .",
    "these models imply an infall radius of 0.03  pc ( @xmath11 ) , an age of @xmath12  yrs , and a central mass of @xmath13  m@xmath14 .",
    "while the agreement of the model with few parameters and the observed molecular line profiles strongly support inside - out collapse , the model is not unique .",
    "for example , in one extreme scenario discussed by zhou et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , an unrelated foreground cloud of just the right excitation properties absorbs emission from a static core and exactly reproduces the infall signatures .",
    "recent molecular line observations of b335 made with the higher angular resolution of interferometry are also starting to show perhaps important discrepancies with the predictions of inside - out collapse ( wilner et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "an extinction map of sufficient depth can probe the density structure of b335 and test the claim for inside - out collapse in a way that is free from many of the problems that plague molecular line studies , including excitation effects and spatially varying abundances of the molecular tracers .",
    "b335 is fortuitously placed for an extinction study , located at galactic coordinates @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which is a direction with a very high density of background stars with uniform properties .",
    "previous optical extinction studies of b335 were not sensitive to the structure of the dense core anywhere close to where the molecular line data suggest collapse ( see bok & mccarthy 1974 , dickman 1978 , tomita et al .",
    "1979 and frerking et al .  1987 ) . in this paper",
    ", we present a near - infrared extinction study of b335 using data from hst / nicmos , supplemented by data from the w.m .",
    "keck observatory .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] briefly reviews the technique and describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents an analysis of the extinction data in the context of several physical models for the b335 density structure , and comparisons with the results of previous studies .",
    "simulations of the observations are also presented , using a monte carlo approach detailed in the appendix .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "measurements of the extinction of stars background to a dense core provides estimates of column density along many pencil beams .",
    "these estimates can be used to determine the overall structure of the obscuring core .",
    "the extinction measurements are best done at infrared wavelengths , where absorption due to dust is much less than in the optical , thereby probing regions of higher ( visual ) extinction .",
    "the basic method is to measure the near - infrared color excess for each background star : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the intrinsic color of the star .",
    "the color excess represents the differential optical depth between the two near - infrared filters , which is directly proportional to dust column density .",
    "the observed color excess may be converted to an equivalent visual extinction using the standard reddening law ( e.g.  rieke & lebosfsky 1985 ) , and then converted to gas column density by adopting a gas - to - dust ratio ( e.g.  bohlin et al .",
    "there are some uncertainties in both of these conversions .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio in protostellar cores is the subject of some debate ; at low extinction there is some evidence to suggest that it is constant along different lines of sight in the galaxy ( bohlin et al .  1978 ) , but at high extinction it is unclear whether the gas - to - dust ratio remains constant .",
    "for example , if grain growth occurs in the high extinction regions as a result of molecular depletion and agglomeration , then one might expect lower extinction for a given column density .",
    "the reddening law is probably less problematic and nearly universal at near - infrared wavelengths , given the small grain sizes present in protostellar envelopes ( mathis 1990 ) .    in practice",
    ", the color excess method does not require a knowledge of the intrinsic colors of the individual extincted stars .",
    "a statistical correction to their observed colors may be obtained empirically from the background stellar population , provided it is sufficiently spatially uniform . for stars of spectral types",
    "a0 to late m , in the main sequence or the giant loci , the intrinsic colors lie in the narrow range @xmath19 ( koornneef 1983 ) .",
    "therefore , at high extinctions , little error is introduced by simply assuming a mean background star color derived from nearby control fields .",
    "the b335 globule was imaged with the nic3 camera on hst ( cycle 7nicmos , go-7843 , 1998 june 23 ) using two broadband filters , f160w and f222 m , similar to the usual h band and k band filters that are matched to the 1.6  @xmath20 m and 2.2  @xmath20 m atmospheric windows .",
    "the nic3 camera has @xmath21 pixels with size @xmath22 giving a @xmath23 field of view .",
    "the observations were obtained during the second of two periods of a few weeks when the hst secondary mirror was adjusted to allow the nic3 camera to be in focus ( the `` nic3 campaigns '' ) .",
    "the observing program had two parts : ( 1 ) a deep @xmath24 mosaic of the central region of high extinction , taking 6 orbits , and ( 2 ) a radial strip of images extending about @xmath25 from the center , taking 1 orbit , to reach the background stellar population and provide a sample of stars to transform nicmos magnitudes to a standard photometric system .",
    "the length of the strip was the maximum allowed before suffering the heavy overhead of guide star reaquisition .",
    "( the strip included the center of b335 as insurance in the event that the deeper observations were unsuccessful . )",
    "figure  [ fig : skysurv ] shows the observed fields overlayed on a wide field optical view of the region from the digital sky survey .",
    "we note that the nic3 orientation angle on the sky and stepping direction of the radial strip were given by the spacecraft orientation on the day of observation .",
    "advance specification of a particular orientation would have created an untenable scheduling constraint ; the orientation obtained was based solely on where the spacecraft happened to be during the period when the nic3 camera was in focus and b335 was accessible .",
    "the central region was observed with a standard nine - point spiral dither pattern with @xmath9 offsets , and a total exposure time of 896 seconds per dither .",
    "the resulting square mosaic covers @xmath26 .",
    "the strip images were taken in _",
    "one - chop _ mode , an exposure time of 56 seconds per chop , with an offset of @xmath27 between chops , and roughly @xmath28 overlap between successive images .",
    "this resulted in a strip of coverage @xmath29 wide that extends @xmath30 from the mosaic center .",
    "the data were taken in the nicmos _ multiaccum _ mode , for which an initial readout of the detector array is followed by non - destructive readouts during the course of a single integration .",
    "the intermediate readouts can be used to identify and to remove the effects of cosmic ray hits and saturated pixels .",
    "the nicmos data were obtained from the hst archive in fits format both unprocessed and already processed through the stsci pipeline ( calnic a & b ) .",
    "initial inspection showed the stsci pipeline did not adequately deal with a variety of instrumental effects , and so we reprocessed the data in iraf using the nicreduce software developed by brian mcleod ( mcleod 1997 , lehar et al .",
    "the nicreduce package provides superior and more versatile handling of sky and dark current subtraction , as well as cosmic ray hits and other defects .",
    "the bottom rows of the nicmos images suffered from a small amount of vignetting .",
    "the effect was most pronounced in the f222 m images , where about @xmath31 were unusable .",
    "the overlap of images in the dither pattern and in successive images of the strip was sufficient to ensure that the vignetting resulted in only a small loss in sensitivity in the affected regions , and no gaps in the spatial coverage .",
    "the dithered images of the central region of b335 suffered an additional complication due to the presence of a very bright star ( h magnitude of 9.0 ) on the west side of the mosaic center .",
    "the enormous count rate from the star caused the image reduction software to produce a small depression in the continuum level of the quadrant of each image that contained the star .",
    "this deviation was fixed by adding a constant to the relevant quadrant so that for each image the median pixel value was uniform in all four .",
    "ghost impressions of the star in successive exposures were interactively masked in the affected images and were not included in the final mosaic .",
    "stars were identified by visual inspection of the images , as several attempts at automatic star finding were compromised by the effects of diffraction spikes and rings around the brighter stars .",
    "photometry on each star was performed with the suite of routines in the _ apphot _ package .",
    "a series of apertures from @xmath32 to @xmath33 in radius was used for each star .",
    "aperture corrections were then performed using a minimum of four isolated and bright stars from the relevant image .",
    "each aperture was used to calculate a magnitude and associated error as a check to identify any unusual behavior .",
    "the measured count rates were corrected to a @xmath34 radius aperture , and then multiplied by 1.075 as detailed in the nicmos photometric calibration cookbook ( available from stsci ) .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were then transformed to the vega scale using constants for each filter provided in the hst data handbook ( version 4 , dec 1999 ) . for stars that were observed in a region of overlap between strip images , weighted mean magnitudes were calculated . for stars observed in the overlap region of the central mosaic and the first strip image ,",
    "the value from the more sensitive central mosaic was taken .",
    "the complete nicmos photometry list contains 1026 stars detected with the f160w filter and 471 stars detected with the f222 m filter with magnitude error @xmath35 .",
    "the nicmos limiting magnitudes are spatially dependent and are depicted in figure  [ fig : limplot ] . in the central 32@xmath36 , with the most integration time ,",
    "the limiting magnitudes are h=24.8 and k=21.5 ( in the cit system ) .",
    "observations of b335 were made on 1998 july 10 using nirc ( matthews & soifer 1994 ) on the keck i telescope .",
    "these observations were made for two reasons : ( 1 ) to obtain a better study of the stellar background population around b335 , and ( 2 ) to transform the nicmos f160w and f222 m magnitudes to a standard system .",
    "the nirc has @xmath21 pixels with size @xmath37 , giving a @xmath38 field of view .",
    "each basic observation consisted of nine dithered 5 second integrations , in a @xmath24 pattern with @xmath27 offsets , which were mosaiced together .",
    "observations were made with j , h , and k filters .",
    "the program had three parts : ( 1 ) nine images of the central region of b335 , approximately mimicking the sub - images of the nicmos central mosaic , ( 2 ) five images leading away from the center of b335 , at each position of a nicmos strip image , and ( 3 ) four additional fields @xmath39 away from b335 , to study the characteristics of the stellar background population .",
    "these regions are marked on figure  [ fig : skysurv ] .",
    "the data reduction and calibration was done in iraf following the standard dark / flat / sky subtraction procedures , using a running flat .",
    "this procedure works well when the background emission does not change rapidly . for some periods during the observations ,",
    "the sky emission in the h band did change relatively quickly , and the background subtraction for observations during these periods is not perfect .",
    "the typical seeing during the night was @xmath33 , though there were periods when it was better and also much worse .",
    "the majority of stars in the keck images of b335 could be identified with reference to the nicmos data , since the keck images are all less deep than the nicmos equivalents and the field of view slightly smaller . for the keck fields",
    "not observed with nicmos , all stars were again identified by visual inspection .",
    "photometry was performed for all non - saturated stars using the _ apphot _ package .",
    "again , a series of increasing radial apertures was used for each star , and each aperture was used to calculate a magnitude .",
    "this approach allowed a confidence level in the measurement to be assigned to each star , based on whether the distribution of measurements from different apertures was consistent with the predicted uncertainty .",
    "if the spread of the various magnitudes was greater than 0.2 magnitudes , then the measurement was identified as low quality ( 18% of the stars detected at h and 17% of the stars detected at k ) .",
    "these low quality stars have point - spread - functions that differ from the norm , mainly from those periods of poor and varying seeing conditions .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were transformed to the cit system through observations of the hst infrared standards sj9164 and sj9182 ( persson et al .",
    "1998 ) and the ukirt standard fs35 ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) . the internal dispersion in the zero points measured for these stars was 0.02 magnitudes , and no atmospheric extinction correction could be discerned .",
    "the keck photometry list contains a total of 297 stars detected at h , and 340 stars detected at k , in the overlap region between the keck and nicmos datasets .",
    "the four keck fields @xmath39 away from b335 contain typically 100 detected stars per square arcminute with h@xmath40 .",
    "the four fields display uniform properties and no discernable reddening ; the star counts in each image are identical to within poisson errors , and the mean @xmath41 color of the fields are all in the range @xmath42 to @xmath43 , consistent with the intrinsic colors of giant and main sequence stars .",
    "a detailed study of the background stellar population is presented in section  [ sec : background ] .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the keck observations are approximately h=19.7 and k=19.6 .      for extinction calculations ,",
    "the nicmos f160w and f222 m magnitudes are transformed to standard h and k magnitudes .",
    "linear least squares fits ( not including the lower quality keck data ) give slopes of @xmath44 for ( h@xmath45f160w ) vs.  f160w , @xmath46 for ( k@xmath45f222 m ) vs.  f222 m , and @xmath47 for ( h@xmath45k ) vs.  ( f160w@xmath45f222 m ) , where the formal uncertainties in the fitted slopes are @xmath48 .",
    "the formal uncertainties are underestimates of the true uncertainties since the magnitude comparison slopes are strongly biased by the few brightest stars , and the color comparison slope is biased by the few reddest stars .",
    "experimentation with subsets of the stars resulted in variations in the fitted slopes at the @xmath49 level .",
    "we conclude that these data provide no evidence for non - zero slopes or color terms in the transformation .",
    "we calculated constant offsets for the magnitude conversions for each filter , using a weighted mean of ( h@xmath45f160w ) and ( k@xmath45f222 m ) values .",
    "the result is h = f160w@xmath50 , and k = f222m@xmath51 , where the uncertainties represent the standard error in the mean .",
    "figure  [ fig : coltrans ] shows the scatter plot of @xmath41 vs.   ( f160w@xmath45f222 m ) with the derived color transformation superimposed . for the @xmath41 colors of interest , in the range 0 to 3 , the differences between the two photometric systems are remarkably small .",
    "support for the accuracy of these transformations comes from published ground - based photometry of the one very bright star observed by krgel et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , who measured johnson h and k fluxes of @xmath52  mjy and @xmath53  mjy , which correspond to magnitudes of h@xmath54 and k@xmath55 , and color @xmath56 .",
    "these values compare very favorably with the transformed nicmos magnitudes of h@xmath57 and k@xmath58 , and color @xmath59 .",
    "note that systematic errors limit the accuracy of the nic3 photometry to a few percent , and are not reflected in the random uncertainties quoted here .",
    "to check the uniformity of the background stellar population , the starcounts and mean colors of the four keck off fields were compared with those for the two nicmos strip images furthest away from the center of b335 .",
    "the colors in the different images are consistent within the observed dispersions .",
    "the fifth nicmos strip field has a mean color and standard deviation of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , very similar to that found for the combined keck off - fields : @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the fourth nicmos strip field shows a slightly redder mean color ( @xmath64 ) and higher dispersion ( @xmath65 ) than the other fields ; most likely , this field is not far enough away from the center of b335 to be completely free of its extinction , and this field was excluded from our characterization of the background stellar population .",
    "figure  [ fig : backcolor ] presents a histogram of the @xmath41 colors of the `` background '' stars in 0.1 magnitude bins ( excluding the keck stars with lower quality photometry ) .",
    "the @xmath41 mean color is 0.13 magnitudes , with standard deviation 0.16 magnitudes .",
    "also shown for comparison is a gaussian distribution with the same mean and standard deviation ( normalized so that the area under each curve is equal ) .",
    "a color - magnitude diagram constructed for this sample shows no sign of any important systematic trends , e.g. there is no tendency for fainter stars to be redder .",
    "the starcounts in the fifth nicmos strip field are indistinguishable from those in the keck off - fields , taking into account the different different size fields of view .",
    "figures  [ fig : images ]  &  [ fig : strip ] show the nicmos f160w and f222 m images of the b335 region .",
    "the central mosaic images in figure  [ fig : images ] may be compared to h band and k band images of a smaller part of the central region of b335 obtained over three nights at keck by hodapp ( 1998 ) using nirc . in the region of overlap",
    ", the f222 m image shows the same stars as the k band image , but the overall sensitivity of the nicmos image is better and the point - spread - function much sharper , leading to better separation of nearby stars .",
    "the f160w image shows many more stars than the corresponding h band image .",
    "in contrast with the ground - based data , essentially all stars detected with the f222 m filter are also detected with the f160w filter because of the low background and greater sensitivity of the space - borne nicmos at the shorter wavelength .",
    "figure  [ fig : nicmos ] conveys much of the information from the central mosaic of nicmos observations .",
    "the left plot is a pseudo - image in that the two axes are spatial , the apparent brightness of a star determines its `` size '' , and the value of its @xmath41 color determines its `` color '' .",
    "the right - hand plot displays the radial dependence of the @xmath41 colors out to @xmath66 from the center .",
    "the origin in both plots is given by the position of the embedded young stellar object , as determined by interferometric observations of millimeter continuum emission ( wilner et al .",
    "2000 ) ; the uncertainty in the registration of the nicmos images and the millimeter peak is estimated to be about @xmath34 . based on an inspection of the extinctions , the stars in the right hand plot",
    "have been marked according to their spatial location : those that lie in the north or south quadrants are marked in red , and those that lie in the east or west quadrants are marked in blue ( the quadrant boundaries are marked in the pseudo - image as dashed lines ) . defining @xmath67 to be the angle subtended between the vector to a star and the axis of the outflow ( which runs very close to east - west ) , this division may be expressed simply as @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "the nicmos central mosaic image contains 239 stars detected at h , 121 stars detected at k , and 119 stars that are detected in both filters .",
    "the detected star closest to the embedded young stellar object is at @xmath70 radius .",
    "the reddest detected star is at @xmath71 radius and has an @xmath41 color of 4.0 , corresponding to over 60 magnitudes of equivalent visual extinction .",
    "the major features of figure  [ fig : nicmos ] are : ( 1 ) a strong gradient in the @xmath41 colors as one approaches the protostar ; ( 2 ) fewer stars are detected close to the center , despite better sensitivity ; ( 3 ) reddening of the stars turns off into background noise beyond the @xmath72 ( 0.15  pc ) outer radius of dense gas determined from molecular line data ( zhou et al .",
    "1990 ) ; ( 4 ) there is a marked asymmetry in the stellar colors associated with the bipolar outflow stars viewed within @xmath73 of the outflow axis have systematically lower colors ; ( 5 ) the dispersion of the @xmath41 colors at a given radius and in the quadrants away from the outflow is @xmath74 greater than that of the background population .",
    "we describe several theoretical models for the density distribution of b335 and evaluate the success of these models in light of the extinction data .",
    "the models considered are not meant to comprise an exhaustive list .",
    "they include the inside - out collapse models previously proposed for b335 , bonnor - ebert spheres , and simple power law descriptions .",
    "we also discuss briefly the effects of the bipolar outflow and turbulent motions in b335 .",
    "there is a substantial literature of theoretical work by frank shu and colleagues describing the density structure of collapsing dense cloud cores , starting from the initial condition of a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "taking parameters appropriate for the b335 region , we briefly describe the pre - collapse state , the spherical inside - out collapse , and the modifications to spherical collapse expected for slow initial rotation or weak magnetic fields .",
    "_ pre - collapse configuration _ : the initial state is that of a singular isothermal sphere ; the density falls off as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the radius , with the normalization of the density determined by the effective sound speed . for b335 , zhou et al .",
    "( 1990 ) derive a value for the effective sound speed of @xmath77  km  s@xmath78 from molecular line data , which corresponds to a kinetic temperature of 13 k. the static initial condition is therefore given by : @xmath79 where the conversion to a molecular hydrogen number density assumes 0.7 for the the mass fraction in hydrogen .",
    "_ spherically symmetric collapse _ : the simplest scenario is the spherically symmetric collapse ( shu 1977 ) . in this model , a spherical wave of collapse propagates outwards from the center at the effective sound speed .",
    "the radial distance that the wave has traveled , sometimes called the infall radius , is the only additional parameter that defines the density distribution . inside the infall radius ,",
    "conditions approach free fall , with the density taking the asymptotic form @xmath80 . by reproducing essential features of several molecular line profiles with this model , zhou et al .",
    "( 1993 ) claimed evidence for inside - out collapse in b335 .",
    "choi et al .  ( 1995 ) made more detailed radiative transfer models to match the zhou et al .",

    "note that this derived infall radius falls entirely within the deep central mosaic of nicmos coverage .",
    "_ rotation _ : the effect of slow rotation on the collapse has been solved using a perturbative approach from the spherically symmetric case ( terebey , shu & cassen 1984 ) .",
    "the result is a distortion to the shape of the collapse wave of order @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the number of times that the cloud has rotated since collapse initiated ( this is also equivalent to the ratio of the infall radius to the centrifugal radius ) .",
    "for b335 , frerking et al .",
    "( 1987 ) found an angular velocity of @xmath85  s@xmath86 through c@xmath87o observations .",
    "this indicates a value of @xmath88 , and a distortion in the wave by only @xmath89  an entirely negligible effect .",
    "the density distribution is more strongly distorted , with the effect largest near the center of collapse . for radii greater than a tenth of the infall radius ( i.e.@xmath90 ) ",
    "already well within the innermost radius where stars are detected  the correction is always less than of order @xmath91 , which is also completely negligible .",
    "such slow rotation also has an unimportant effect on the model line profiles towards the center of b335 ( zhou 1995 ) .",
    "we therefore do not include rotation in our models .",
    "_ magnetic fields _ : the effect of a weak magnetic field on the inside - out collapse of a cloud has been studied by galli & shu ( 1993 ) and li & shu ( 1997 ) .",
    "the collapse wavefront and the density distribution are again distorted , in a similar way to the rotational model .",
    "in the magnetic case , the parameter @xmath84 is given by the ratio of the infall radius to the magnetic radius : @xmath92 galli & shu ( 1993 ) showed that the field effects only a small perturbation to the spherically symmetric solution outside a radius of @xmath93 .",

    "1984 ) , consistent with a balance between heating and cooling processes . to account for",
    "the factor with non - thermal motions also seems implausible , given the measured widths of molecular lines .",
    "a non - thermal contribution of @xmath1550.350.45  km  s@xmath78 would be required , which is clearly at odds with a multitude of molecular line data .",
    "for example , zhou et al.(1990 ) used observations of h@xmath81co to determine a small turbulent contribution of @xmath156  km  s@xmath78 to the thermal sound speed .",
    "similar results from a variety of different molecules are documented by menten et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and frerking , langer & wilson ( 1987 ) .",
    "one might envision a form of non - thermal support that is not reflected in the observed molecular line - widths , perhaps because of a special viewing geometry .",
    "if magnetic support were primarily from a static field and not waves , and this field were oriented so that the motions were not observable along the line - of - sight , then it would be effectively undetectable .",
    "although such a special situation seems contrived and unlikely , the orientation of b335 is special in that the outflow lies close to the plane of the sky , which may make such a configuration more plausible .",
    "another possibility that affects the overall scaling lies in the outer boundary , i.e. where the cloud ends .",
    "zhou et al .  ( 1990 ) calculated the mass of b335 using an outer radius of 0.15  pc based on their radio map and the 250  pc distance estimate .",
    "the molecular line profiles of dense gas tracers are not particularly sensitive to this assumption .",
    "we have adopted this value for the outer radius throughout the extinction modeling .",
    "indeed , the column densities are also insensitive to this assumption since the density falls off steeply with radius . for a star at the infall radius of the best - fitting inside - out collapse model ( fit b ) , doubling the outer radius of the cloud increases the predicted extinction by only 7.5% , which is an unimportant amount with respect to the derived scaling factors .",
    "an overestimate of the distance to b335 would also result in predicted column densities that are too small .",
    "this distance uncertainty may be the dominant source of systematic error in the study .",
    "the distance of 250  pc was adopted from optical measurements of stellar reddening versus distance by tomita et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , and this distance is uncertain at the 50% level .",
    "if b335 were closer , then the extinction would be larger at the same angular radius . to account for",
    "the full scaling factor would require that the distance be @xmath15735 times closer , only about 5080  pc , which seems unreasonable .",
    "also , for a given level of observed extinction , the inferred mass of the globule is proportional to the square of its distance ( since the angle subtended by b335 is fixed ) . for the outer boundary assumption of zhou et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , the mass inferred from our extinction data is @xmath158 the 14  m@xmath14 for a distance of 250  pc may be large for a small globule , but reducing the distance by the whole scaling factor lowers the mass to less than 1  m@xmath14 for the inside - out collapse model , and a little over 1  m@xmath14 for the bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "this seems small given that the globule must be forming a star with a substantial fraction of a solar mass , and losing a lot of mass through outflow in the process .",
    "furthermore , in the context of the inside - out collapse model , a reduction in the distance also results in a smaller mass for the protostellar core , as well as a shorter time since the onset of collapse ( both are proportional to the distance for a given sound speed and infall radius ) . in short , a closer distance for b335 would ameliorate the discrepancy between the observed and predicted extinction , but it is not clear if this could account for the entire difference .",
    "a final uncertainty is the conversion from column density to color excess using the gas - to - dust ratio and reddening law .",
    "significant variations in the reddening law have not been observed , and they are unlikely to explain much of the observed discrepancy in the color excess ( although we briefly return to this point in the appendix ) . by contrast , the gas - to - dust ratio has been observed to vary in the galaxy , with variations of @xmath159 not uncommon along different lines of sight ( bohlin et al .",
    "if the gas - to - dust ratio in b335 were lower than the standard value for the interstellar medium , or the reddening law steeper , then this would cause us to underestimate the extinction .",
    "potentially , the full scaling factor could be accounted for by this uncertainty , or perhaps by some combination of a closer distance and a modified gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "for example , if the true distance to b335 were actually 100  pc , and the gas - to - dust ratio were about one half of the standard value ( i.e.  @xmath160 ) , then these two factors would fully account for the discrepancy between observed extinction and the predictions of either model , and also give a reasonable mass for the globule of @xmath161 .",
    "if molecular hydrogen were to deplete onto dust grains , this could cause such a decrease in the gas - to - dust ratio at high density .",
    "however , h@xmath81 is not thought to undergo significant freeze - out in this way ( sandford & allamandola 1993 ) , and a decrease in the gas - to - dust ratio is at odds with evidence that suggests an increase in high extinction regions ( e.g.  bohlin et al .",
    "1978 , de geus & burton 1991 , and ciolek & mouschovias 1996 ) .      the density distribution in protostellar cores may also be studied through dust emission . if the emission is observed at long enough wavelength that the rayleigh - jeans approximation applies , then , in the optically thin regime",

    "the effect of the outflow on the extinction data is reproduced very well by models that consider a hollowed out bipolar cone of constant opening angle . in the context of the inside - out collapse models ,",
    "the observed asymmetry is too large to be explained by either rotation , or a weak magnetic field .",
    "5 .   the entire extinction dataset can be well fitted by a model that includes infall , bipolar outflow , and an additional @xmath140 dispersion that mimics residual turbulent motions .",
    "the best fit outflow semi - opening angle is @xmath3 and the best fit infall radius is @xmath1 .",
    "the fitted value of the infall radius is consistent with those derived from molecular line studies of b335 , and supports the inside - out collapse interpretation of the density structure .",
    "the fitted opening angle for the bipolar outflow is somewhat larger than has been observed in high velocity co emission , perhaps because the molecular line studies do not recover the full outflow width due to confusion with ambient emission at low velocities .",
    "the normalization of the observed color excess is a factor of @xmath179@xmath180 higher than the value predicted using the nominal 250  pc distance to b335 , and the standard gas - to - dust ratio and near - infrared reddening law .",
    "the discepancy can conceivably be explained by a combination of a closer distance and a lower gas - to - dust ratio .",

    ", under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 we thank bob goodrich and randy campbell for invaluable assistance with the observations obtained at the w.m .  keck observatory .",

    "this appendix contains the tools and general recipe for constructing the simulated observations of b335 presented in sections  [ sec : sims ]  &  [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "we construct a composite luminosity function for the background population by combining the data from fields away from the extinction of the b335 dense core . in deriving the luminosity function ,",
    "the photometry for each field was cut at a very high completeness level , where the number of stars per unit magnitude range peaks .",
    "( this is a very conservative estimate of limiting magnitude . ) to avoid any issues concerning how the stars should be binned , the cutoff was determined by finding where the gradient of the cumulative luminosity function was steepest . for the dataset from the fifth nicmos strip field , which includes 202 detected stars at h and 85 detected stars at k , the cut - off magnitudes are 20.7 at h , and 18.7 at k. for the combined dataset of the four keck off - fields , which includes 242 detected stars at h and 246 detected stars at k , the cut - off magnitudes were 18.8 for both filters .",
    "the empirical h - band luminosity function was calculated in three parts out to the nicmos high completeness limit ( h@xmath181 ) . for the bright end ( h@xmath182 ) ,",
    "only stars from the nicmos fifth strip field are included , as stars brighter than this limit were saturated in the keck images . for the mid - range ( @xmath183 ) ,",
    "stars from both datasets contribute to the function .",
    "for the faint end ( @xmath184 ) , above the keck high completeness limit , only stars in the nicmos fifth strip field were included . in each part , the number of stars was divided by the relevant observed area to build up the cumulative luminosity function . in the part",
    "where the nicmos and keck data overlap ( @xmath183 ) , the two datasets show good agreement .",
    "the k band luminosity function was constructed following the same procedure , and it is effectively the same as for the h band , offset by the mean color of @xmath185 magnitudes .",
    "the central regions of b335 were observed to a deeper limiting magnitude than the strip or the @xmath39 off fields , by about 4 magnitudes ( h band ) at the mosaic center , and about 3 magnitudes at the edge ( see figure  [ fig : limplot ] ) .",
    "although the stars in these central regions of b335 are highly extincted , the empirical background luminosity function must be extrapolated in order to simulate the deepest observations .",
    "since the least extincted star in the nicmos mosaic has @xmath186 , corresponding to an extinction of @xmath187 , the luminosity function must be extrapolated by about 2 magnitudes at h in the simulations .",
    "the form of the h cumulative luminosity function suggests that a broken power law provides a good description .",
    "the function was fitted by minimizing the @xmath126 of the fit to the bright - end of the luminosity function .",
    "the resulting function is given by : @xmath188      simulated observations of b335 were constructed by superimposing a model cloud on a field of background stars with the appropriate characteristics .",
    "the column density was calculated at the position of each background star and converted into two observable quantities : ( 1 ) an extinction at h band , and ( 2 ) a color excess @xmath136 .",
    "these conversions are based on the gas - to - dust ratio , and reddening law .",
    "( a brief discussion on the uncertainties of these quantities is given in section  [ sec : method ] . )      1 .",
    "generate a background star field by selecting randomly from the broken - power - law cumulative luminosity function in concert with the gaussian color distribution of the background population .",
    "the broken - power - law luminosity function is extended to h@xmath189 , just beyond the limiting magnitude at the center of the nicmos mosaic ( note that model background stars intrinsically fainter than h@xmath190 are not recovered in the simulated observations of the fitted models from table  [ tab : fits ]  the function is extended to h@xmath189 simply to ensure completeness ) .",
    "positions for each star are assigned randomly within a region @xmath191 , to encompass the area of the nicmos observations .",
    "2 .   select a model density distribution to describe b335 .",
    "3 .   calculate the column density for each star in the region .",
    "4 .   convert the column density to an extinction at h band , @xmath192 , and a color excess @xmath136 using an assumed gas - to - dust ratio , r , and a reddening law , @xmath193 .",
