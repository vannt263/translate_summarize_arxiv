    "recent years have witnessed a growing interest in the analytical information theory of finite quantum systems .",

    "these quantities , which quantify the spatial delocalization of the single - particle density of the systems in various complementary ways , are most appropriate uncertainty measures because they do not make any reference to some specific point of the corresponding hilbert space , in contrast to the variance and other dispersion measures .",
    "moreover , they are closely related to numerous energetic and experimentally measurable quantities of the system @xcite and they have been used as indicators of various atomic and molecular phenomena @xcite . since the schrdinger equation can be exactly solved only for a few quatum - mechanical potentials which model most of the quantum chemical and physical phenomena , most of the efforts have been focused on the harmonic and hydrogenic systems up until now .",
    "basically this is because the wavefunctions of their ground and excited states are controlled by the hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials ( hermite , laguerre , jacobi ) whose analytical properties are under control .",
    "+ apart from the fisher information whose explicit values have been found @xcite , the entropic measures of the oscillator - like and hydrogenic systems have not yet been analytically determined for all quantum - mechanically - allowed states except for the ground and a few low - lying states @xcite and for the high - lying states in the shannon case ( see eq .",

    "moreover , there exist various classical and quantum coding theorems @xcite which endow the rnyi and tsallis entropies with an operational ( so , experimentally verifiable ) meaning .",
    "+ in this work we analytically determine the shannon , rnyi and tsallis entropies of the highly - excited ( rydberg ) hydrogenic states on the same footing , by use of a methodology based on the strong asymptotics of laguerre polynomials .",
    "the rydberg states @xcite play a relevant role from both fundamental and applicable points of view .",
    "indeed they can be considered a fertile laboratory where to investigate the order - to - chaos transitions through the applications of electric fields and , because of their extraordinary properties , they are being presently used in many technological areas such as e.g. quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the entropic moments and their associated shannon , rnyi and tsallis entropies quantify the internal disorder of the rydberg atom as given by its quantum probability density in a complementary , but much more complete , way than the variance and other dispersion measures whose values have been already shown @xcite . + the structure of this work is the following . first , in sec .",

    "it is also curious to mention that if these regimes dominate , then the gamma factors in the constant @xmath58 for the oscillatory cosine regime explode . for the cosine - bessel regime",
