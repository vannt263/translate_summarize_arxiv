    "we then tested this framework in the study of magnetization reversal times in the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "this first test - case was especially simple , since many properties of the transition state , i.e. the state with highest free energy on the trajectory from one free energy minimum to the other , were well - known .",
    "for instance , it is a state in which half the system has a positive , and the other half a negative magnetization , and these two regions are separated by a pair of interfaces which span the shorter dimension of the simulation cell .    here",

    "the organization of our manuscript is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",

    "next in section  [ sec : theory ] , we outline the theoretical framework , based on our work on magnetization reversals , but extended to nucleation phenomena .",

    "to study the behavior of nucleation times at temperatures below the critical one we may consider an ensemble of a large number of systems prepared in states with no large negative clusters present and study the rate at which one of the clusters in the system grows beyond the critical cluster size , after which the system is removed from the ensemble .",
    "the spin - flip dynamics described above may be represented by a master equation for the probability distribution @xmath21 of finding a system in the state @xmath22 at time @xmath23 . due to the huge number of possible states this master equation can not be solved analytically or even numerically for system sizes of practical interest .",

    "in this paper we showed that for two dimensional ising models with spin - flip dynamics becker - dring theory provides an excellent description of nucleation time distributions , provided a realistic description is used for the free energy of the growing droplets .",
    "we determined this free energy from cluster size distributions in equilibrium monte carlo simulations and found it may be fitted well by the becker - dring expression , provided one uses surface tensions that are 10 to 20% higher than the surface tension of a bulk interface at zero field .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by auer and frenkel@xcite in their studies of crystal nucleation in colloidal hard sphere systems .",
    "they also determined cluster free energies by monitoring the frequency of occurrence of clusters of a given size . like we they could fit the resulting curves quite well by a becker - dring expression with an effective surface tension that exceeds the bulk surface tension by in their case 20 to 40% .",
    "a point one may question is whether the assumption of independent noninteracting clusters holds even for clusters of small size .",
    "this may indeed be doubted , but fortunately , at least for the asymptotic nucleation frequency @xmath144 this is not really relevant .",
    "one may choose to define as clusters only those clusters that have a size @xmath145 , with @xmath146 chosen such that clusters of this size already are very rare , but still @xmath147 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nu ] ) and ( [ freeenergy ] ) it then follows that @xmath148 since the terms with @xmath149 in the first sum in ( [ eq : nu ] ) basically do not contribute . as a consequence of this the asymptotic nucleation rate in the system is independent of the choice of @xmath146 .    for the short - time nucleation rate",
    "the free energy of small clusters is also important , especially if one starts from a state of zero magnetization .",
    "however , if one starts from a quasi - equilibrium distribution representing the state after a sudden reversal of the magnetic field , the short time behavior will be dominated by clusters that were fairly large to start with and again eq .  ( [ freeenergy ] ) may be trusted . in",
    "@xcite van beijeren gave explicit expressions for the short - time behavior , which may be used if the latter is well approximated by a diffusion equation in an external potential .",
    "in the present case these can not be used , since on the relevant time scales the hopping process between neighboring cluster sizes is not well - approximated by a diffusion process . and",
    "since the hopping rates depend on cluster size no analytic expressions for the short - time behavior are available .",
    "but the numerical solution of the master equation ( [ master ] ) gives a very good agreement with the results from our monte carlo simulation of the nucleation process , as was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : short ] .    besides the free energy as a function of cluster size our calculations require the transition rates @xmath150 between neighboring values of the cluster size .",
    "these we estimated by setting them proportional to the mean circumference of a cluster , determining the proportionality constant from the simulated mobility of a straight interface in cylindrical geometry and imposing the detailed balance condition ( [ detbal ] ) .      * strong fields should modify the diffusion coefficient ; this effect is neglected .",
    "the freedom to modify the field strength within the metastable region is limited though , and long nucleation times , as seen mostly in real experiments , require weak fields . *",
    "the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be determined by the size of the cluster alone , and is calculated on the assumption that this shape is strictly spherical .",
    "this requires that the temperature is not too low , because at very low temperatures the equilibrium shape of the cluster is squarish rather than circular @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the temperature should not be too close to the critical temperature for shape fluctuations to be reasonably small .",
    "to some extent these fluctuations are taken into account , since our calculation of the diffusion coefficient is done for a fluctuating interface around a cylinder .",
    "but it is by no means certain that the fluctuations of a circular interface are in all aspects comparable to those of the interface around the cylinder .",
    "* it may happen that an island splits up or that two islands merge , corresponding in our theoretical framework to non - zero transition rates @xmath151 and @xmath152 with @xmath153 .",
    "this effect also is partly accounted for through the numerical determination of the diffusion constant on a cylinder , but especially for larger islands the difference in geometry may cause additional effects .",
    "however , these will only become important in systems that contain a sizable density of islands of spins aligned with the external field .",
    "hence , also this approximation can be trusted least near the critical point . *",
    "no memory effects are accounted for explicitly . for spin - flip dynamics memory effects",
    "will chiefly be due to the influence of shape fluctuations on the transition rates .",
    "since shape fluctuations on larger length scales will decay only slowly , these may be fairly long lasting effects .",
    "again , our way of determining the difusion coefficient will take many of these effects into account implicitly , but memory effects involving large shape fluctuations may be different for the present cluster geometry . for magnetization conserving dynamics ( consisting e.g. of local spin exchanges )",
    "much stronger memory effects exist due e.g. to the effect that a spin that is released from a large cluster has high probability of reattaching to it soon .    under conditions",
    "in which the effects above are negligeable , our theoretical framework is able to estimate nucleation rates with an accuracy in the range of 20% .",
    "the small systematic overestimation by about 10% of the nucleation time by theory may have several causes .",
    "the radius of a cluster will be slightly larger than our estimate because especially a large cluster will typically contain a few holes in its interior .",
    "but in the investigated range of temperatures this should not amount to a correction of more than 3% .",
    "the assumption that the diffusion coefficient is independent of the orientation of the interface also may be not entirely correct . at low temperatures",
    "certainly a diagonal interface is much more mobile than a straight one , but at the present fairly elevated temperatures one would not expect this effect to be large .",
    "further there could be effects from the possibility of cluster splittings and mergings , though some of these certainly are accounted for through the numerical determination of the diffusion constant on a cylinder ."
