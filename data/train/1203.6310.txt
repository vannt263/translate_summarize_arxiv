    "( here the case @xmath9 was conjectured by psa and the general case was later conjectured by seymour . )",
    "this beautiful conjecture was proved for large @xmath1 by komls , sarkzy and szemerdi  @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath10 of course corresponds to dirac s theorem  @xcite on hamilton cycles . for @xmath9 ,",
    "there have been significant improvements in the bound on @xmath1 that is required ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , many other recent advances have been made on embedding spanning subgraphs in dense graphs ( see e.g.  @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "for instance , recall that @xmath7 has an _ @xmath11-factor _ if @xmath7 contains @xmath12 vertex - disjoint copies of @xmath11 . the famous hajnal - szemerdi theorem  @xcite states that every graph with minimum degree at least @xmath8 contains a @xmath13-factor .",
    "more generally , khn and osthus  @xcite determined the minimum degree that @xmath7 needs to have to ensure the existence of an @xmath11-factor in @xmath7 ( up to an additive constant depending on  @xmath11 ) .",
    "it is natural to ask for probabilistic analogues of these results , i.e.  given a graph @xmath14 on @xmath1 vertices , how large does @xmath15 have to be to ensure that @xmath3 a.a.s .",
    "contains a copy of @xmath14 ? here @xmath3 denotes the binomial random graph on @xmath1 vertices with edge probability @xmath15 and we say that a property @xmath16 holds a.a.s .",
    "( asymptotically almost surely ) , if the probability that @xmath16 holds tends to @xmath17 as @xmath1 tends to infinity .",
    "( note that formally one actually needs to ask the above question for a sequence of graphs @xmath18 whose order tends to infinity . )",
    "this turns out to be a surprisingly difficult problem , and the answer is known for very few ( families of ) graphs @xmath14 .",
    "a notable exception is the seminal result of johansson , kahn and vu  @xcite , who determined the ` approximate ' threshold for the existence of an @xmath11-factor .",
    "so this is a probabilistic version of the result in  @xcite mentioned above .",
    "also , riordan  @xcite obtained a very general result , which gives a bound that can be applied to every graph @xmath14 . as a corollary , he obtained the threshold for the existence of a spanning hypercube in @xmath3 and several kinds of spanning lattices , e.g.  the square grid .",
    "his result can be applied to powers of hamilton cycles to give the following result ( see section  [ sec : riordan ] for the straightforward details ) :    [ thm : riordan ] let @xmath19 be fixed .",
    "suppose that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath3 contains the @xmath5th power of a hamilton cycle .",
    "a simple first moment argument shows that this result gives the correct threshold for @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , note that the number of edges in the @xmath5th power of a cycle of length @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "so if @xmath23 and @xmath25 , it follows that the expected number of appearances of the @xmath5th power of a hamilton cycle in @xmath3 is at most @xmath26 .",
    "however , for squares ( i.e.  when @xmath9 ) theorem  [ thm : riordan ] does not give the correct answer .",
    "indeed , the above first moment argument suggests that the threshold should be close to @xmath27 .",
    "our main result is an ` approximate ' threshold , i.e.  our bound on @xmath15 is tight up to a factor of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is arbitrary .",
    "our argument works for higher powers in the same way as it does for squares , so we formulate our proof for arbitrary @xmath30 .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath29 and @xmath19 be fixed .",
    "suppose that @xmath31 .",
    "then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath3 contains the @xmath5th power @xmath32 of a hamilton cycle .",
    "note that theorems  [ thm : riordan ] and  [ thm : main ] as well as the result on @xmath11-factors in  @xcite ( see theorem  [ thm : jkv ] ) imply that the threshold for a @xmath13-factor is much smaller than that for the @xmath5th power of a hamilton cycle .",
    "so this is different from the ` deterministic ' setting described earlier , where the minimum degree conditions are the same .",
    "we now discuss some further related results on embedding spanning subgraphs in @xmath3 .",
    "the case of hamilton cycles ( i.e.  when @xmath10 ) has been studied successfully and in great detail . in particular , a classical result of komls and szemerdi  @xcite and korshunov  @xcite implies that the threshold function for the existence of a hamilton cycle is @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , much more is true : a celebrated result of bollobs  @xcite and  ajtai , komls and szemerdi  @xcite states that the hitting time for the emergence of a hamilton cycle on @xmath1 vertices coincides a.a.s .  with the hitting time of the property that the minimum degree is at least  2 .",
    "( an algorithmic version of this result was later proved by bollobs , fenner and frieze  @xcite . ) on the other hand , the expected number of hamilton cycles already tends to infinity when @xmath34 .",
    "so the existence of vertices of degree less than two in @xmath3 can be viewed as a ` local obstruction ' to the existence of a hamilton cycle in @xmath3 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : riordan ] shows that there are no ` local obstructions ' .",
    "it seems natural to conjecture that the case of squares is similar , i.e. that the threshold for the square of a hamilton cycle in @xmath3 is at @xmath35 .",
    "another class of subgraphs which has received much attention is that of spanning trees .",
    "the best general result is due to krivelevich  @xcite , who showed ( amongst other results ) that if @xmath36 is any tree on @xmath1 vertices of bounded maximum degree and @xmath37 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath3 contains a copy of @xmath36 .",
    "it seems likely that the term @xmath38 in this result can be replaced by a much smaller function .",
    "this is supported by several results on certain classes of trees .",
    "for instance , the threshold for a hamilton path is @xmath39 by the above results on hamilton cycles . as another example , hefetz , krivelevich , and szab  @xcite showed that @xmath39 is the ( sharp ) threshold for a tree @xmath36 having a linear number of leaves .    in the probabilistic setting , it is also natural to ask for ` universality ' results .",
    "again , this is a question where much progress has been made recently . given a graph @xmath7 and a family of graphs @xmath40",
    ", we say that a graph @xmath7 is _ @xmath40-universal _ if @xmath7 contains every member of @xmath40 as a subgraph .",
    "an important case is when @xmath41 consists of all graphs on @xmath1 vertices with maximum degree at most @xmath42 . here",
    "the best bound is due to dellamonica , kohayakawa , rdl and ruciski  @xcite , who showed that if @xmath43 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath3 is @xmath44-universal .",
    "note that the @xmath5th power of a hamilton cycle on @xmath45 vertices has maximum degree @xmath46 .",
    "so the bounds one obtains for this case are significantly weaker than the ones given by theorems  [ thm : riordan ] and  [ thm : main ] .",
    "the proof in  @xcite is based on the second moment method .",
    "instead , our proof is based on the ` absorbing method ' , which was introduced as a general method by rdl , ruciski and szemerdi  @xcite ( the underlying idea was also used earlier , e.g.  by krivelevich  @xcite ) .",
    "the method has proved to be an extremely versatile tool for embedding various types of spanning subgraphs in dense graphs .",
    "though additional difficulties arise in the context of ( sparse ) random graphs , we believe that the method has significant further potential in this setting .    this paper is organized as follows . after introducing some notation",
    ", we define an ` absorber ' , which will be the crucial concept for extending the @xmath5th power of an almost spanning cycle into the @xmath5th power of a hamilton cycle .",
    "we then describe the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] in section  [ sec : mainproof ] , under the assumption that lemmas  [ lem : absorber_factor ] ,  [ lem : linking ] and  [ lem : pathfactor ] hold .",
    "section  [ sec : mainproof ] also contains an informal overview of the proof .",
    "these lemmas are proved in the subsequent sections . in the short final section ,",
    "we show how theorem  [ thm : riordan ] follows from the more general result in  @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath47 and sometimes also @xmath48 for the number of vertices of a graph @xmath7 .",
    "we write @xmath49 and sometimes also @xmath50 for the number of edges of @xmath7 .",
    "we say that two graphs @xmath14 and @xmath7 are disjoint if they are vertex - disjoint .",
    "given graphs @xmath7 and @xmath14 , an @xmath14-factor in @xmath7 is a collection of @xmath51 pairwise disjoint copies of @xmath14 in  @xmath7 .    we denote the path on @xmath1 vertices by @xmath52 .",
    "the _ distance _ between two vertices @xmath53 and @xmath54 in a graph @xmath7 is the length ( i.e.  the number of edges ) of the shortest path between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the _ @xmath5th power _ of a graph @xmath7 is the graph @xmath55 whose vertex set is @xmath56 and in which two vertices @xmath57 are joined by an edge if and only if the distance between @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath7 is at most @xmath5 .",
    "so @xmath58 denotes the @xmath5th power of  @xmath52 .",
    "suppose that @xmath59 and that @xmath60 .",
    "we will view @xmath61 as the first vertex of @xmath52 and @xmath62 as its final vertex .",
    "the _ initial endsequence _ of @xmath58 is the sequence @xmath63 and the _ final endsequence _ of @xmath58 is the sequence @xmath64 .",
    "suppose that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are two sequences of vertices such that all these @xmath46 vertices are distinct from each other .",
    "@xmath68 is defined as follows : let @xmath69 be the @xmath5th power of a path such that the initial endsequence of @xmath69 is @xmath16 and the final endsequence of @xmath69 is @xmath70 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath68 by removing all edges within @xmath16 and within @xmath70 .",
    "we will use the notion of linkages to join up @xmath5th powers of paths into longer ones .",
    "more precisely , suppose that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are @xmath5th powers of paths which are pairwise disjoint , that @xmath16 is the final endsequence of  @xmath71 , that @xmath70 is the initial endsequence of  @xmath72 and that @xmath68 is an @xmath67-linkage which meets @xmath73 only in @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath75 is again the @xmath5th power of a path .",
    "we will omit floors and ceilings whenever this does not affect the argument .",
    "we write @xmath76 for the natural logarithm and @xmath77 .",
    "the aim of this section is to define an _ absorber _ , which is the main tool in our proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] . roughly speaking",
    ", an absorber @xmath16 will be the union of the @xmath5th power @xmath78 of a path @xmath79 and the @xmath5th power @xmath80 of a path @xmath81 such that the following two properties are satisfied :    * the two endsequences of @xmath78 are the same as the two endsequences of @xmath80 .",
    "* @xmath82 is obtained from @xmath83 by adding one extra vertex @xmath84 ( which we call the absorbtion vertex ) .",
    "thus if we can find the @xmath5th power @xmath85 of some cycle which contains @xmath78 as a subgraph but does not contain  @xmath84 , then we can ` absorb ' @xmath84 into @xmath85 by replacing @xmath78 with @xmath80 .",
    "when defining the absorber , we have to make sure that our random graph @xmath3 a.a.s .",
    "contains many disjoint copies of this absorber .",
    "a result of johansson , kahn and vu ( theorem  [ thm : jkv ] below ) implies that the latter will be the case if the @xmath17-densities of all subgraphs of the absorber are not too large .",

    "we call @xmath79 the _ spine _ of the absorber and  @xmath84 its _ absorbtion vertex_. we will view one endvertex of @xmath79 as its first vertex and the other endvertex of @xmath79 as its last vertex .",
    "this induces an order of the vertices on  @xmath79 .",
    "split @xmath79 into @xmath96 consecutive disjoint segments @xmath97 such that @xmath98 has @xmath99 vertices for each @xmath100 and @xmath101 consists of the final @xmath87 vertices of  @xmath79 . for @xmath100 , in @xmath98 we label the @xmath102st , the @xmath103nd , the @xmath104rd and the @xmath105th vertices by @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
