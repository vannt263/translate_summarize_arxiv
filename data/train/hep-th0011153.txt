    "the interesting problem of the compatibility of a five - dimensional compactification scheme with higher derivative gravity and dilaton field has been investigated . in @xcite the simultaneous presence of higher dimensional hedgehogs and of higher derivatives gravity theories has been discussed in a seven - dimensional space - time .",
    "the simultaneous presence of dilaton field and higher order curvature corrections is relevant for different reasons .",
    "there are two possible approaches to warped compactification schemes . in the first approach it is assumed , from the very beginning ,",
    "that warped compactifications have nothing to do with string theory .",
    "the problem then reduces to the search of a suitable field theoretical model of higher dimensional ( global or local ) defects living along the transverse dimensions .",
    "a complementary approach is to postulate that warped compactifications are ( somehow ) connected to string theory . even in this second approach , however , the dilaton field and the ( possible ) higher curvature terms ( arising from the string tension corrections ) are usually neglected @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the dilaton field is strictly constant and that the string tension corrections are vanishing should be relaxed in order to investigate the ( possible ) interplay of warped compactification schemes with string models .",
    "five - dimensional warped compactifications have been studied in the context of generalized gravity theories with higher derivatives @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the dilaton field poses , however some problem .",
    "the main results concerning the interplay between five - dimensional warped compactifications and string motivated effective action can be summarized as follows @xcite .",
    "if the dilaton is constant ( but higher order curvature corrections are still present ) five - dimensional warped compactifications are consistent with the effective action derived from the string amplitudes corrected to first order in the string tension .",
    "if the dilaton is linear in the bulk coordinate warped compactification is not consistent with the presence of string tension corrections unless the conformal coupling between the dilaton and the string tension corrections is absent @xcite .",
    "interesting solutions interpolating between a naked singularity and a warped regime ( for large bulk coordinate ) have also been obtained .",
    "the purpose of the present investigation is to is to analyze the solutions of the metric ( [ line ] ) in the context of the string effective action @xcite with and without higher derivatives corrections @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    up to now",
    "the compatibility of six - dimensional warped compactification with gravity theories inspired by string amplitudes has not been analyzed . in six - dimensional warped compactifications",
    "the transverse space is not flat ( in contrast with the five - dimensional case ) .",
    "this observation implies on one hand that the internal space is larger and , on the other hand , that two warp factors are generically allowed .",
    "the tree - level solutions have more general singularity properties if compared to the five - dimensional case .",
    "these solutions are `` kasner - like '' and they are the static analog of their time - dependent counterpart which is often discussed in cosmological solutions @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of string tension corrections introduces also differences with respect to the five - dimensional case .    in six dimensions exponentially decreasing warp factors correspond to critical points of the @xmath0 functions computed at a given order in the string tension .",
    "define , in fact , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . by critical points",
    "we mean those ( stable or unstable ) solutions for which @xmath9 and @xmath10 are simultaneously constant and negative .",
    "the critical points of the system correspond to a static dilaton fields which either increases or decreases ( linearly ) for large @xmath11 .",
    "also the constant dilaton solution is possible .",
    "this situation should be contrasted with the five - dimensional case where only one warp factor is present .",
    "the critical points are not always stable . if the initial conditions of the dilaton and of the warp factors are given around a given critical point ( say for @xmath12 ) it can happen that for larger @xmath13 the compatibility with the @xmath0-functions will drive the solution away from the ( original ) critical point . in this case singularity may also be developed .",
    "the present analysis is not meant to be exhaustive and suffers of two obvious limitations . in order to make an explicit calculation",
    "the effects of the first string tension correction has been studied .",
    "this is just an example since , when singularities are developed , _ all _ the string tension corrections should be included .",
    "the second point to be emphasized is that possible corrections in the dilaton coupling have also been neglected .",
    "this might be justified in some regimes of the solutions but it is not justified in more general terms . with these two warnings in mind the reported results should be understood more as possible indications than as a firm conclusion .",
    "the present analysis has been performed in the string frame where the dilaton field is directly coupled both to the einstein - hilbert term and to the first string tension corrections .",
    "it is interesting to notice that singularity properties of a given solution may change from one frame to the other . a linearly increasing dilaton ( in the string frame )",
    "results in curvature singularities in the einstein frame ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "the einstein and the string frame are , however , physically equivalent .",
    "suppose that the curvature invariants are regular in one frame and suppose that the dilaton is a smooth function of the bulk radius ( interpolating , for instance , between two constant regimes ) .",
    "then , the geometry looks regular in both frames enforcing the physical equivalence of the two descriptions .    in order to assess that six - dimensional warped compactification is fully consistent with the presence of the dilaton field and of string tension corrections",
    "some requirements should be , in our opinion , satisfied .",
    "the goal would be to obtain stable warped solutions with constant dilaton .",
    "stable warped solutions means that the critical point of the low energy @xmath0 functions ( truncated to first order in the @xmath14 corrections ) lead to exponentially decreasing warp factors .",
    "the constancy of the dilaton field @xmath15 implies the constancy of the coupling constant ( i.e. @xmath16}$ ] ) and this is a necessary ( even though not sufficient ) condition for the stability of the solutions .",

    "the powers satisfy specific sum rules leading ultimately to divergences in the curvature invariants .",
    "the features of the tree - level solutions ( as a function of the bulk radius ) are the static analog of the time - dependent case which has been widely exploited in cosmological considerations .",
    "kasner - like solutions can be found both for vanishing and non vanishing bulk cosmological constant .",
    "this means that , at tree - level , exponentially decreasing warp factors can not be generically obtained .",
    "moreover , since the kasner - like behaviour leads to curvature singularities , there will be a regime where the solutions hit the string curvature scale where higher order string tension corrections can not be neglected .",
    "the inclusion of the first order @xmath14 correction produces computable modifications in the @xmath0-functions which can be viewed , for the present purpose , as a nonlinear dynamical system .",
    "solutions with exponentially decreasing warp factors become then possible : they correspond to critical points of the dynamical system . defining @xmath114 and @xmath115",
    "interesting critical points can be obtained in the case of constant ( and negative ) @xmath41 and @xmath10 .",
    "these critical points correspond to linear ( decreasing ) dilaton solutions .",
    "the obtained critical points are not always stable .",
    "it can happen that a given critical point correspond to stable / unstable node or to stable / unstable spiral points .",
    "in the case @xmath45 the kasner branch of the solution ( for @xmath116 ) can be analytically connected to a critical point .",
    "there are also solutions where two critical points can be analytically connected . in this case",
    "a given @xmath117 turns into @xmath118 .",
    "unfortunately in the numerical examples analyzed in the present investigation @xmath119 .",
    "in the case @xmath120 the situation is mathematically more complicated . by giving initial conditions of the system near",
    "a critical point singularities seem to be developed .",
    "numerical evidence of this behavior has been presented by studying the singularity properties of the curvature invariants .",
    "it is now the moment of comparing what we have with what we ought to have .",
    "the ideal situation would be to find stable fixed points of the low energy @xmath0 functions compatible with a constant dilaton field .",
    "in other words it would be nice to find solutions interpolating between a singularity and a critical point of constant dilaton or between an unstable critical point and a constant dilaton solution .",
    "such a behavior would give rise to exponentially decreasing warp factors with constant dilaton coupling which is exactly the original assumption tacitly adopted in five and six - dimensional warped compactifications .",
    "this situation is never realized in the set - up described in the present investigation but it can not be excluded in principle in slightly different frameworks .",
    "it has been shown that exponentially decreasing warp factors are certainly compatible with the low energy string effective action , however , the obtained critical points do not have the wanted physical properties . these results should not be viewed as conclusive and might only be due to the limitations of the present analysis .",
    "we will now speculate about various possibilities which might cure the limitations of our approach allowing , hopefully , for stable critical points with frozen dilaton . as we discussed the first ( obvious ) limitation which should be relaxed concerns the dilaton dynamics . in the present paper only string tension corrections have been considered . in principle",
    "one can expect that corrections in the dilaton coupling should also be included for consistency since they become relevant roughly at the same scale at which string tension corrections are turned on .",
    "following a complementary way of thinking one can also try to account for the effect of the dilaton potential which has been also ( partially ) neglected since we modeled it with a cosmological constant .",
    "an encouraging remark , in this direction , would be that already within our over - simplified set - up decreasing dilaton solutions were compatible with exponentially decreasing warp factors .",
    "these solutions might be analytically connected with a critical point of constant dilaton once a dilaton potential is present .",
    "a less encouraging evidence is however that constant dilaton solutions are obtained ( within the present analysis ) only as @xmath121 effect .",
    "these solutions are clearly non - perturbative and it might be that only by summing up all the string tension corrections a definite answer can be obtained .    another limitation of the present analysis is the absence of realistic ( thick ) brane sources .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that by adding a brane of finite thickness in the game some of the unstable critical points of the system will be stabilized at a constant value of the dilaton coupling fixed , presumably , by the tension of the brane .",
    "this possibility should be further scrutinized . again",
    "an encouraging hint in this direction is that , already at the level of our analysis , it is possible to connect a critical point to kasner - like solutions .",
    "furthermore in our analysis we completely neglected the possible presence of @xmath66-form fields whose effect should also be studied . to neglect",
    "the antisymmetric field strength is consistent if we look at the explicit form of the first string tension correction .",
    "however , an antisymmetric tensor field with large magnetic component might introduce qualitatively new solutions . in the present discussion",
    "the antisymmetric tensor field has been frozen . however , once an antisymmetric tensor is allowed on the same footing of the other light modes the structure of the string tension corrections changes radically : higher powers of the field strength will appear to first order in the string tension corrections .",
    "we leave all these themes for forthcoming investigations .",
    "finally , some cosmological implications of our work should be mentioned .",
    "once thick branes , antisymmetric tensor field and dilaton potetial will be taken into account in simplified models , time dependent solutions might be studied . in this case",
    "the problem will certainly be more complicated but not totally hopeless if stable critical points of the truncated @xmath0 functions will be found in the time - independent case .",
    "we also leave these topics for future investigations .",

    "these are the usual general relativity criteria for the analysis of physical singularities of a given space - time . using einstein equations together with topological considerations",
