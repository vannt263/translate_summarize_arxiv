    "in this paper we study the production rate of multi - strange objects within the urqmd model ( v2.3 ) and a micro+macro hybrid approach to heavy ion reactions .",
    "similar to the rqmd model @xcite which was employed in @xcite , urqmd is a microscopic transport approach based on the covariant propagation of constituent quarks and diquarks accompanied by mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom .",
    "it simulates multiple interactions of ingoing and newly produced particles , the excitation and fragmentation of color strings and the formation and decay of hadronic resonances . at rhic energies , the treatment of sub - hadronic degrees of freedom is of major importance . in the urqmd model ,",
    "these degrees of freedom enter via the introduction of a formation time for hadrons produced in the fragmentation of strings @xcite .",
    "the leading hadrons of the fragmenting strings contain the valence - quarks of the original excited hadron .",
    "in urqmd they are allowed to interact even during their formation time , with a reduced cross section defined by the additive quark model , thus accounting for the original valence quarks contained in that hadron @xcite .    for the microscopic+macroscopic calculation ,",
    "the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd ) is used to calculate the initial state of a heavy ion collision for a subsequent hydrodynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "this has been done to account for the non - equilibrium dynamics in the very early stage of the collision . in this configuration",
    "the effects of event - by - event fluctuations of the initial state are naturally included .",
    "the coupling between the urqmd initial state and the hydrodynamical evolution proceeds when the two lorentz - contracted nuclei have passed through each other .",
    "@xmath17    after the urqmd initial stage , a full ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional ideal hydrodynamic evolution is performed using the shasta algorithm @xcite . for the results presented here an equation of state for a hadron - resonance gas without any phase transition is used @xcite .",
    "the eos includes all hadronic degrees of freedom with masses up to @xmath18 gev , which is consistent with the effective degrees of freedom present in the urqmd model .",
    "one should note that we apply a purely hadronic eos , for energy densities where a transition to the qgp is expected ( see also @xcite for details on the model and comparison of extracted particle yields to data ) .",
    "final particle ( and memo ) multiplicities are mainly sensitive on the degrees of freedom at chemical freezeout which is reflected in the hadronic eos .",
    "dynamical observables such as momentum and rapidity spectra are more sensitive on the underlying dynamics .",
    "in addition , a phase transition could catalyse a strangeness destillation process further enhancing memo production",
    ". however , studying the effects of a phase transition on memo production is left subject of future investigations .",

    "this criterion corresponds to a t-@xmath20-configuration where the phase transition is expected - approximately @xmath21 mev at @xmath22 .",
    "the hydrodynamic fields are mapped to particle degrees of freedom via the cooper - frye equation on an isochronous hyper - surface .",
    "@xmath23 here @xmath24 are the boosted fermi or bose distributions corresponding to the respective particle species .",
    "inputs for these distributions are the masses and chemical potentials of the desired particles . for our calculation",
    "we assumed the mass of a memo to be the sum of the masses of all hadrons it is composed of .",
    "similarly the total chemical potential is the sum of the constituents , and is composed of baryon and strange - quark chemical potentials @xmath20 and @xmath25 .",
    "+ the particle vector information is then transferred back to the urqmd model , where rescatterings and the final decays are performed using the hadronic cascade . using this parametrisation of the model one obtains a satisfactory description of data in a energy regime of @xmath26 gev .",
    "a more detailed description of the hybrid model including parameter tests and results for multiplicities and spectra can be found in @xcite .    to calculate the multiplicities of memos in the fair energy region ,",
    "we employ the introduced hybrid approach to heavy ion collisions .",
    "thus , the fluctuating initial state produced in urqmd , is coupled to a ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional hydrodynamics evolution .",
    "when the energy density drops below @xmath27 the freeze - out is performed and memos and strangelets are produced according to the cooper - frye description ( [ cooper_frye ] ) . as distinctive inputs for the distribution functions , the chemical potentials @xmath28 and masses of the memos enter as discussed above .",

    "a ( micro)canonical description of the system strongly decreases strange particle yields @xcite .",

    "a relaxation of this assumption within the hybrid approach will require the explicit propagation of the strangeness density ( similar to the treatment of the baryon density ) .",

    "compared to many previous studies on memo and strangelet production , based on statistical models with global strangeness and baryon number conservation , the present approach indicates that the local strangeness density clumps strongly in coordinate space and that strangeness is unevenly distributed in momentum space .",

    "<S> exotic forms of deeply bound objects with strangeness have been proposed long ago ( see @xcite ) as collapsed states of matter , either consisting of baryons or quarks . </S>",
    "<S> for example the h di - baryon ( a six quark state ) was predicted by jaffe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later a multitude of bound di - baryon states with strangeness were proposed using quark potentials @xcite or the skyrme model @xcite . however , the ( non-)observation of multi - quark bags , e.g. strangelets and ( strange ) di - baryons is still one of the open problems of intermediate and high energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> most noteworthy in this respect has been the hunt for the pentaquark over the last 10 years , which re - stimulated this field and resulted in a reported observation at the cern sps accelerator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the early theoretical models based on su(3 ) and su(6 ) symmetries @xcite and on regge theory @xcite suggest that di - baryons should exist . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , even qcd - inspired models predict di - baryons with strangeness s = 0 , -1 , and -2 . </S>",
    "<S> the invariant masses range between 2000 and 3000 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , masses and widths of the expected 6-quark states differ considerably for these models . nevertheless , most qcd - inspired models predict di - baryons and none seems to forbid them . </S>",
    "<S> + on the conventional hadronic side , however , hypernuclei are known to exist already for a long time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the double @xmath1 hypernuclear events reported so far are closely related to the h di - baryon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> metastable exotic multi - hypernuclear objects ( memos ) as well as purely hyperonic systems of @xmath1 s and @xmath2 s were introduced in @xcite as the hadronic counterparts to multi - strange quark bags ( strangelets ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most recently , the nijmegen soft - core potential was extended to the full baryon octet and bound states of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 di - baryons were predicted @xcite . for previous estimates of strangelet production and memo formation , the reader is referred to @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a major uncertainty for the detection of such speculative states is their ( meta)stability . </S>",
    "<S> metastable exotic multi - hypernuclear objects ( memos ) , for example , consist of nucleons , @xmath6 s , and @xmath7 and are stabilised due to pauli s principle , blocking the decay of the hyperons into nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> only few investigations about the weak decay of di - baryons exist so far ( see @xcite for a full discussion and new estimates for the weak nonleptonic decays of strange di - baryons ) : in @xcite , the @xmath8-di - baryon was found to decay dominantly by @xmath9 for moderate binding energies . while the @xmath10 bound state , which has exactly the same quantum numbers as the @xmath8-di - baryon , was studied in @xcite . here , the main non - mesonic channel was found to be @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> if the life time of the @xmath10 correlation or @xmath12 particle is not too long , the specific decay channels might be used to distinguish between both states .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several searches in heavy - ion collisions for the @xmath8-di - baryon @xcite and for long - lived strangelets @xcite with high sensitivities , so far with no conclusive results . in @xmath13 collisions at </S>",
    "<S> the fermilab however , the @xmath8-di - baryon seems to be excluded over a wide range of masses ( @xmath14 gev ) and lifetimes ( @xmath15 to @xmath16 sec ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hypernuclei have been detected most recently in heavy - ion reactions at the ags by the e864 collaboration @xcite . </S>"
