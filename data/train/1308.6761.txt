    "de finetti ( 1974 ) presented a theory of finitely additive probability in which the concept of _ prevision _ played the roles of both probability and expected value ( or expectation ) .",
    "de finetti s theory was motivated in two different , but equivalent , manners .",
    "first , he developed a theory of _ coherent _ gambling in which a bookie chooses fair prices for gambles while trying to avoid uniform sure loss .",
    "second , he took a decision - theoretic approach in which an agent chooses previsions for random variables while being subject to a loss function .",
    "the agent tries to avoid choosing previsions such that an alternative choice could achieve uniformly smaller loss .",
    "de finetti developed his theory fairly completely for the case in which all random variables under consideration are bounded .",
    "he realized that unbounded random variables introduce interesting issues for his theory , but he did not pursue those issues very far .",
    "crisma , gigante , and millossovich ( 1997 ) and crisma and gigante ( 2001 ) present one form of an extension of de finetti s theory to unbounded random variables .",
    "this paper presents a number of extensions that are more in the spirit of de finetti s original theory .",

    "coherence of previsions , as de finetti ( 1974 , chapter 3 ) formulates it , is the criterion that a rational decision maker tries to avoid making decisions that lead to uniformly larger loss than alternative available decisions .",
