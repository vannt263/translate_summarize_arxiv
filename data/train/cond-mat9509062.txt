    "the effects of a magnetic field on electrons in quantum regime is a fascinating problem with very rich physics .",
    "the path - dependent geometric phase of the wave function is known to play a fundamental role in the problem .",
    "@xcite for example , the geometrical phase and other geometrical considerations , such as the gauge invariance @xcite and the effect of edges @xcite , are very crucial to the quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite moreover , the quantized hall conductance has a topological character , both for a system without boundary ( periodic boundary conditions ) @xcite and for a system with boundaries ( edges ) @xcite .",
    "thus geometry and topology are of central importance in this realistic condensed - matter problem .",
    "in this paper we will show that a certain exotic algebraic structure plays an important role as well , if one includes the effects of a periodic potential in this problem .",
    "this is not too surprising , since there are two fundamental periods in the problem : one is the original period in the geometric phase , and the other is that of the periodic potential .",
    "interplay of the two intrinsic periods brings more and interesting structures and , therefore , much richer physics into the problem .    normally a system with strong periodic potential is modeled by the tight - binding hamiltonian and the effects of the magnetic field",
    "is included by the pierls substitution .",
    "this procedure is usually motivated as an approximation .",
    "however , the gauge invariance is preserved by the substitution , i.e.   both of the original continuum and the lattice systems have the same local @xmath3 symmetry . thus in our opinions ,",
    "the pierls substitution has captured a fundamental feature of the problem and , therefore , has a meaning more fundamental than as merely an approximation .",
    "so in the problem of a bloch electron in a uniform magnetic field , one can use the flux per plaquette , @xmath2 , to characterized the system .",
    "the equations of motion can then be reduced to one - dimensional ones , which appear in many different physical contexts , ranging from the quantum hall effect@xcite to quasi - periodic systems @xcite . when @xmath2 is irrational , that is , the magnetic flux is incommensurate with the periodic potential , the spectrum is known to have an extremely rich structure like the cantor set and to exhibit a multifractal behavior.@xcite another interesting case is the weak field limit .",
    "when the flux is small , the semi - classical treatment of the wkb type is justified .    recently a relationship is found between this physical problem and a mathematically new concept , the so - called quantum group.@xcite the essential point is that at least for some special points in the spectrum , e.g.  at the mid - band points , the hamiltonian ( in certain gauge ) can written as a linear combination of generators of a quantum group , called @xmath0 . on the basis of this observation , wiegmann and zabrodin has proposed bethe - ansatz type equations for corresponding wave functions .",
    "this opened the possibility of solving the problem analytically .",
    "indeed , we have turned the dream into reality : we have found explicit analytical solutions to this problem at the first time in the literature .",
    "@xcite the algebraic structure of @xmath0 and the associated bethe ansatz equations also gives us a new method to solve the problem numerically .",
    "especially when we study the irrational limit of a well - organized sequence of rational fluxes , the new method is convenient and beneficial in revealing the multifractal behavior , as we briefly reported also in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this way",
    ", it becomes clear that in addition to the underlying geometrical and topological structures , the problem of a bloch electron in magnetic field also has an interesting , fundamental algebraic structure hidden in it .",
    "previously there were works in the literature about possible relation of the quantum groups to physics .",
    "many of the works , however , deal with a sort of artificial ( rather realistic ) @xmath4-deformation of an original physical problem . on the other hand , for the bloch electrons , the quantum group is for a realistic physical problem : we are dealing with ordinary electrons , not the _ q_-electrons .",
    "therefore we have shown that quantum groups can have a fundamental meaning for observable real phenomena .    in this paper",
    "we are going to report on more details of our published results and to present a number of new solutions and results .",
    "we will describe our analytical solutions in detail and in a self - contained manner .",
    "we also present more numerical solutions of the bethe ansatz equations when the analytical ones are not available . in the next section , sec .",
