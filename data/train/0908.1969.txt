    "neutrinos are among the most abundant particles in our universe , and since at least two of the three neutrino mass eigenstates have masses much larger than the current temperature , neutrinos contribute to the matter density and are important for cosmological structure formation .",
    "oscillation experiments have established two mass differences , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , from which the heaviest mass eigenstate must have a mass of at least @xmath3 ev .",
    "even such a relatively small mass will have the effect of suppressing the power spectrum of matter fluctuations by @xmath4% , an effect which is significantly larger than the precision with which the matter power spectrum can be measured in upcoming surveys .",
    "consequently this has led to a much increased interest in gaining a detailed understanding of how neutrinos affect structure formation . in linear theory",
    "the effect is extremely well understood .",
    "however , these results apply only on very large scales , @xmath5 , whereas most of the cosmologically relevant information from large - scale structure surveys is in the range @xmath6 . on these intermediate scales",
    "it is mandatory to correct for non - linear effects , even if surveys are carried out at intermediate redshifts where non - linearity is weaker . in the semi - linear regime",
    "the power spectrum can be estimated using analytic methods ( see @xcite )",
    ".    however , in the fully non - linear regime the most accurate , but also most time - consuming method is to use full @xmath0-body simulations with neutrinos included in a self - consistent way . in a previous publication we carried out a large suite of simulations with neutrinos included @xcite , and found a significant non - linear correction caused by neutrinos .    in a recent paper @xcite we showed that for realistic neutrino masses , quantities such as the power spectrum can be calculated very reliably on all scales , using a grid - based method which tracks the linear neutrino density contrast on a grid while using the full non - linear structure of cdm .    the problem with both the particle - based and the grid - based methods is that they can not reliably probe the small - scale structure of neutrinos . in particle - based codes",
    "the problem is that the thermal velocity of the neutrino component is so large that it introduces noise at an unacceptable level .",
    "the grid - based method does not resolve neutrino bound structures and therefore by construction does not allow us to probe for example the neutrino content of a halo",
    ".    in the present paper we present a hybrid method which retains the good features of both methods and still runs at an acceptable speed .",
    "the idea is to start with neutrinos described on a grid , and then convert part of the grid to @xmath0-body particles when the thermal motion of neutrinos decreases to a few times the flow velocities in the simulation .",
    "the neutrino @xmath0-body particles are created in different momentum bins , with individual transfer functions and thermal velocities .",
    "we therefore present @xmath0-body simulations with 15 different neutrino hot dark matter species . in a following paper",
    "we will use this hybrid method to investigate neutrino clustering on sub mpc scales .",
    "in section  [ theory ] we outline the theoretical framework and problems with combining particle and fluid approaches .",
    "section  [ implementation ] gives a technical description of the implementation of the hybrid method and section  [ results ] presents our results .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusions ] contains our discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this subsection we will briefly outline how the evolution of massive neutrinos is followed in linear theory .",
    "the notation is identical to @xcite .",
    "we use the metric in the conformal newtonian gauge    @xmath7    in a perturbed universe the phase - space distribution function is expanded to first order as follows @xmath8 with the perturbation parametrised by @xmath9 , and the zeroth - order fermi - dirac phase - space distribution function given by @xmath10 here @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the proper redshifting momentum and @xmath13 is the neutrino temperature today .",
    "after neutrino decoupling the collisionless boltzmann equation evolves the distribution function as    @xmath14    expanding the perturbation @xmath15 in a legendre series the perturbed neutrino energy density is given by a weighed sum over neutrino momentum states    @xmath16    where @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 and not @xmath19 is used to weigh the individual momentum bins , an assumption which breaks down when the gravitational flow velocity approaches the thermal velocity of the individual momentum states .    from the boltzmann equation the @xmath20 s are related to each other and the metric potentials by    @xmath21    the second term on the right hand side of the equation for @xmath22 encodes the effect of structure forming in evolving gravitational potentials , whereas the first term incorporates the effect of velocity on structure formation .",
    "the change in velocity is affected by the three terms on the right hand side of the equation for @xmath23 .",
    "the first term encodes the effect of flow velocities redshifting in an expanding universe , whereas the second term , found from the hierarchy of @xmath24 s , incorporates the effect of momentum ( and redshift ) dependent neutrino free - streaming .",
    "these two terms give rise to less structure , whereas the last term in the equation for @xmath23 gives the acceleration as a gradient of the gravitational potential .",
    "the quantity calculated in linear theory is the transfer function ( tf ) which evolves the initial primordial perturbation @xmath25 as @xmath26 with @xmath25 given by @xmath27 with adiabatic initial conditions @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : ic ] ) states that neutrinos with different initial momenta have different initial perturbations , also on large scales .",
    "specifically , @xmath30 for @xmath31 , meaning that neutrinos with zero ( read : almost zero ) momentum are unperturbed .",
    "the reason for this is that at each spatial location the neutrino distribution is initially locally a fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential , as is also reflected in @xmath25 . as @xmath32 the fermi - dirac distribution always tends to @xmath33 , independent of @xmath13 , and this means that the distribution function is unperturbed",
    "according to the boltzmann equation , neutrinos with @xmath34 always stay unperturbed . when gravity acts on neutrino particles with @xmath34 , thereby perturbing them , their momenta change , and they are therefore shifted out of the @xmath34 momentum bin , leaving this bin unperturbed .",
    "this fact is contained in the boltzmann hierarchy for the @xmath20 s through the term @xmath35 , which multiplies the gravitational potentials ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) so that different neutrino momentum bins are affected differently by gravity .    the effect of linear as well as non - linear forces on the momenta of neutrino particles changes the shape of @xmath18 beyond linear order .",
    "therefore the weighing of the individual @xmath38 s in the momentum integral changes .",
    "this means that the value of @xmath39 changes , not only at non - linear wavenumbers but also in the linear regime . therefore the linear theory average neutrino tf is not even valid at very large scales , though becoming more accurate for lower neutrino masses .",
    "when we convert densities on the grid into particles we are faced with a potential problem .",
    "imagine that neutrino energy in the first @xmath40 momentum bins are converted to particles at some redshift , while keeping the remaining neutrinos on the grid . at some later time , some of the created particles will have been moved to higher velocities by gravity and therefore really belong to the grid , whereas some density on the grid would have moved to lower velocity , and should have been converted to particles .",
    "this `` leakage '' is problematic because the evolution of the grid is done in camb @xcite while the evolution of particles is followed in gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "the problem is even more severe because the leakage to higher and lower momentum bins are qualitatively different : imagine we dump all neutrino grid bins with momenta less than @xmath41 to @xmath0-body particles at a certain redshift , and let the particles evolve .",
    "due to energy conservation , particles gaining energy above @xmath41 are falling into gravitational potential wells , and are typically clustered , while particles loosing energy are moving out of potential wells , and they are typically much more homogeneous as a population . hence one can not simply artificially decrease the velocities of the high energy particles to account for the leakage across @xmath41 between grid and particles , because the topology , or specific position in phase - space , of particles crossing the momentum boundary from above and below is very different .    ideally , the neutrino @xmath0-body particles should only sample momentum space up to @xmath41 . in the @xmath0-body simulation neutrinos with momenta larger than @xmath41 should therefore not contribute to the gravitational source term ( to avoid double counting ) .",
    "this can surely be done , by eg .",
    "zeroing the mass of these neutrino @xmath0-body particles .",
    "furthermore , we get a zero counting of the particles which , if they had been created from the grid at @xmath42 , would have moved to @xmath43 .",
    "one could include zero mass ghost particles with initial momentum states covered by the grid as tracer particles in the @xmath0-body volume , and then turn their mass on if they leak down to momentum states smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "but in practise the linear assumption of a constant @xmath44 is violated beyond linear order in the @xmath0-body simulation : there is a significant net flow of neutrino mass to higher momentum states .",
    "therefore , turning the neutrino mass on / off as particles cross @xmath41 will lead to a net reduction of overall neutrino mass .",
    "furthermore , particles moving to @xmath42 carry large non - linear corrections which are not found in the corresponding linear grid bins , making the idea with ghost particles less appealing .",
    "however , a simple solution which works well in practise is to convert a sufficiently large number of momentum bins at the same time because that keeps the leakage between converted and non - converted bins to a minimum .",
    "we will discuss this issue in the next sections and demonstrate that errors can be kept under control at the required precision .",
    "we have used the following parameters in a flat cosmology : @xmath45 .",
    "the value for @xmath46 is for a pure @xmath47cdm model without massive neutrinos .",
    "we use values of @xmath48 ev and 1.2 ev with particular emphasis on the latter value , since a high neutrino mass affect structure formation more , thereby testing the accuracy of the hybrid method better .",
    "the primordial density perturbations are followed with the linearised einstein and boltzmann equations , solved in camb @xcite . at @xmath49",
    "the cdm component is taken out of camb and followed in gadget-2 @xcite run in the treepm mode .",
    "the @xmath0-body initial conditions are generated with the zeldovich approximation @xcite as well as a second - order correction term @xcite added to the cdm particles only .",
    "as input to the @xmath0-body code the linear neutrino tf is needed . normally this tf is found from eq .",
    "( [ eq : drho ] ) by integrating over all momenta . however , in our case we need the momentum dependent tfs because when particles are extracted from the grid they are taken in a certain momentum range and the neutrino tfs are highly momentum dependent ( because the free - streaming length depends on @xmath50 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer ] we show the momentum dependent tfs for @xmath51 at @xmath52 , from which the neutrino momentum dependence on the power spectrum is clearly seen .",
    "the effect of free - streaming at small scales is most pronounced for the highest neutrino momentum states , but these states do have the largest tf at large scales .     for @xmath51 . ]    to follow the neutrino component we combine the neutrino particle and grid representations , first explored in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "initially , the neutrinos are represented on a grid , and there are no neutrino @xmath0-body particles .",
    "when the neutrino thermal velocity falls below a few times the average gravitational flow velocity , calculated from the cdm @xmath0-body particles , the lowest momentum part of the neutrino grid energy is converted into @xmath0-body particles .",
    "here there are 3 things to consider .",
    "first , the energy on the neutrino grid should be decreased .",
    "we have 15 neutrino tf bins ( the standard output from camb , the number can easily be modified ) , where @xmath53 runs from 1 to 15 ( upper limits ) in integer steps , corresponding to a bin width of @xmath54 in comoving coordinates for @xmath51 .",
    "when the first bin with the lowest neutrino momentum states is converted to particles , only the remaining 14 bins are summed to get the neutrino grid fourier modes .",
    "the phases of the neutrino particles are made with the same set of random numbers as were the cdm particles at @xmath55 .",
    "second , the neutrino @xmath0-body particle mass should correspond to the mass removed from the grid .",
    "third , when neutrino @xmath0-body particles are created in a certain momentum range , the thermal velocity they recieve lies within this range as well .",
    "this is based on the fact that at the conversion redshift the thermal velocity is much larger than the gravitational flow velocity , meaning that neutrinos in a given bin can at most have originated from the adjacent bins .",
    "it is therefore a very good approximation to give the neutrino particles a thermal velocity corresponding to the bin and assuming that there is no correlation between the thermal and flow components .",
    "this reduced bin mixing caused by the thermal velocity is fortunate , since disentangling these two components would be impossible .",
    "the thermal velocities for a given particle grid position in two succeeding neutrino grid - to - particle conversions are drawn with the same random numbers , but with momenta pointing in opposite directions .",
    "this ensures an approximate local conservation of momentum . in @xcite local conservation",
    "was not enforced due to a higher neutrino particle starting redshift , and since only the average tf was used as input power spectrum .",
    "the neutrino gravitational velocity is found from the difference of two position grids centered around ( with @xmath56 ) our neutrino grid - to - particle conversion redshift ( first described in @xcite ) .",
    "when we add the gravitational flow velocity , some neutrinos will have a total momentum which lies outside of the bin .",
    "this is a problem when part of the neutrino grid is converted to particles at times when the neutrino thermal velocity is only a few times the gravitational velocity , though effectively being a problem only for the low momentum neutrinos .",
