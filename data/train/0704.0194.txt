    "the influence of environment on a single quantum system is the issue of crucial importance in quantum information science .",
    "it is mainly associated with decoherence , or dephasing , which transforms any pure state of a quantum system into a statistical mixture . despite a large body of theoretical work devoted to decoherence",
    ", its mechanism has not been clarified enough .",
    "for instance , how decoherence is related to environmental noise , in particular in the presence of back - action of the system on the environment ( quantum measurements ) .",
    "moreover , decoherence is often intermixed with relaxation .",
    "although each of them represents an irreversible process , decoherence and relaxation affect quantum systems in quite different ways .    in order to establish a relation between the fluctuation spectrum and decoherence and relaxation rates one",
    "needs a model that describes the effects of decoherence and relaxation in a consistent quantum mechanical way .",
    "an obvious candidate is the spin - boson model@xcite which represents the environment as a bath of harmonic oscillators at equilibrium , where the fluctuations obey gaussian statistics @xcite . despite its apparent simplicity",
    ", the spin - boson model can not be solved exactly @xcite . also , it is hard to manipulate the fluctuation spectrum in the framework of this model .",
    "in addition , mesoscopic structures may couple only to a few isolated fluctuators , like spins , local currents , background charge fluctuations , etc .",
    "this would require models of the environment , different from the spin - boson model ( see for instace @xcite ) .",
    "in general , the environment can be out of equilibrium , like a steady - state fluctuating current , interacting with the qubit @xcite .",
    "this for instance , takes place in the continuous measurement ( monitoring ) of quantum systems@xcite and in the `` control dephasing '' experiments@xcite .",
    "all these types on non - gaussian and non - equilibrium environments attracted recently a great deal of attention @xcite .",
    "denotes the coupling between the two dots.,width=264 ]    in this paper we consider an electrostatic qubit , which can be viewed as a generic example of two - state systems .",
    "it is realized by an electron trapped in coupled quantum dots @xcite , fig .  1 . here",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 denote energies of the electron states in each of the dots and @xmath2 is a coupling between these states .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the decoherence of a qubit is associated with fluctuations of the qubit parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , generated by the environment .",
    "indeed , a stochastic averaging of the schrdinger equation over these fluctuations parameters results in the qubit s decoherence , which transfers any qubit state into a statistical mixture @xcite .",
    "in general , one can expect that the fluctuating environment should result in the qubit s relaxation , as well , as for instance in the phenomenological redfield s description of relaxation in the magnetic resonance @xcite .    as a quantum mechanical model of the environment",
    "we consider a single electron transistor ( set ) capacitively coupled to the qubit , e.g. , fig .  2 .",
    "such setup has been contemplated in numerous solid state quantum computing architectures where set plays role of a readout device @xcite and contains most of the generic features of a fluctuating non - equilibrium environment .",
    "the discreteness of the electron charge creates fluctuations in the electrostatic field near the set .",
    "if the electrostatic qubit is placed near the set , this fluctuating field should affect the qubit behavior as shown in fig .",
    "2 . it can produce fluctuations of the tunneling coupling between the dots ( off - diagonal coupling ) by narrowing the electrostatic opening connecting these dots , as in fig .",
    "2a , or make the energy levels of the dots fluctuate , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "note that while in some regimes the set operates as a measuring device @xcite , in other regimes it corresponds purely to a source of noise .",
    "indeed , if the energy level @xmath4 , fig .",
    "2 , is deeply inside the voltage bias  the case we consider in the beginning , the set current is not modulated by the qubit electron . in this case",
    "the set represents only the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit behavior ( `` pure environment '' @xcite ) .     and",
    "@xmath4 denote the energy levels in the left ( right ) reservoirs and in the quantum dot , respectively , and @xmath5 are the corresponding chemical potentials .",
    "the electric current @xmath6 generates fluctuations of the electrostatic opening between two dots ( a ) , or it fluctuates the energy level of the nearest dot ( b).,width=302 ]    a similar model of the fluctuating environment has been studied mostly for small bias ( linear response ) or for the environment in an equilibrium . here",
    ", however , we consider strongly non - equilibrium case where the bias voltage applied on the set ( @xmath7 ) is much larger than the levels widths and the coupling between the set and the qubit . in this",
    "limit our model can be solved exactly for both weak and strong coupling ( but is still smaller than the bias voltage ) .",
    "this constitutes an essential advantage with regard to perturbative treatments of similar models .",
    "for instance , the results of our model can be compared in different regimes with phenomenological descriptions used in the literature .",
    "such a comparison would allow us to determine the regions where these phenomenological models are valid .",
    "since our model is very simple in treatment , the decoherence and relaxation rates can be extracted from the exact solution analytically , as well as the time - correlator of the electric charge inside the set .",
    "this would make it possible to establish a relation between the frequency - dependent fluctuation spectrum of the environment and the decoherence and the relaxation rates of the qubit , and to determine how far this relation can be extended .",
    "we expect that such a relation should not depend on a source of fluctuations .",
    "this point can be verified by a comparison with a similar results obtained for equilibrium environment in the framework of the spin - boson model @xcite .",
    "it is also important to understand how the decoherence and relaxation rates depend on the frequency of the environmental fluctuations .",
    "this problem has been investigated in many phenomenological approaches for `` classical '' environments at equilibrium . yet",
    ", there still exists an ambiguity in the literature related to this point for non - equilibrium environment .",
    "for instance , it was found by levinson that the decoherence rate , generated by fluctuations of the energy level in a single quantum dot is proportional to the spectral density of fluctuations at zero frequency @xcite .",
    "the same result , but for a double - dot system has been obtained by rabenstein _",
    "_ @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it follows from the redfied s approach that the corresponding decoherence rate is proportional to the spectral density at the frequency of the qubit s oscillations ( the rabi frequency)@xcite .",
    "since our model is the exactly solvable one , we can resolve this ambiguity and establish the appropriate physical conditions that can result in different relations of decoherence rate to the environmental fluctuations .",
    "the most important results of our study are related to the situation when back - action of the qubit on the environment takes place .",
    "this problem did not receive such a considerable amount of attention in the literature as , for example , the case of `` inert '' environment .",
    "this is in spite of a fact that the back - action always takes place in the presence of measurement .",
    "there are many questions related to the effects of a back - action .",
    "for instance , what would be a relation between decoherence ( relaxation ) of the qubit and the noise spectrum of the environment ? or , how decoherence is affected by a strong response of environment ?",
    "we believe that our model appears to be more suitable for studying these and other problems related to the back - action than most of the other existing approaches .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : sect .",
    "ii presents a phenomenological description of decoherence and relaxation in the framework of bloch equations , applied to the electrostatic qubit .",
    "iii contains description of the model and the quantum rate - equation formalism , used for its solution .",
    "detailed quantum - mechanical derivation of these equations for a specific example is presented in appendix a. sect .",
    "iv deals with a configuration where the set can generate only decoherence of the qubit .",
    "we consider separately the situations when set produces fluctuations of the tunneling coupling ( rabi frequency ) or of the energy levels .",
    "the results are compared with the set fluctuation spectrum , evaluated in appendix b. sect .",
    "v deals with a configuration where the set generates both decoherence and relaxation of the qubit .",
    "vi is summary .",
    "in this section we describe in a general phenomenological framework the effect of decoherence and relaxation on the qubit behavior .",
    "although the results are known , there still exists some confusion in the literature in this issue .",
    "we therefore need to define precisely these quantities and demonstrate how the corresponding decoherenece and relaxation rates can be extracted from the qubit density matrix .",
    "let us consider an electrostatic qubit , realized by an electron trapped in coupled quantum dots , fig .  1 .",
    "this system is described by the following tunneling hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operators of the electron in the first or in the second dot . for simplicity",
    "we consider electrons as spinless fermions .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath10 , so that only one electron is present in the double - dot . the electron wave function can be written as @xmath11    are the probability amplitudes for finding the electron in the first or second well , obtained from the schrdinger equation @xmath12 ( we adopt the units where @xmath13 and the electron charge @xmath14 ) .",
    "the corresponding density matrix , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , is obtained from the equation @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this can be written explicitly as    [ a02 ] @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . solving these equations",
    "one easily finds that the electron oscillates between the two dots ( rabi oscillations ) with frequency @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , for the initial conditions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the probability of finding the electron in the second dot is @xmath25 .",
    "this result shows that for @xmath26 the amplitude of the rabi oscillations is small , so the electron remains localized in its initial state .",
    "the situation is different when the qubit interacts with the environment . in this case",
    "the ( reduced ) density matrix of the qubit @xmath27 is obtained by tracing out the environment variables from the total density matrix .",
    "the question is how to modify eqs .",
    "( [ a02 ] ) , written for an isolated qubit , in order to obtain the reduced density matrix of the qubit , @xmath27 . in general one expects that the environment could affect the qubit in two different ways .",
    "first , it can destroy the off - diagonal elements of the qubit density matrix .",
    "this process is usually referred to as decoherence ( or dephasing ) .",
    "it can be accounted for phenomenologically by introducing an additional ( damping ) term in eq .",
    "( [ a02b ] ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the decoherence rate . as a result",
    "the qubit density - matrix @xmath27 becomes a statistical mixture in the stationary limit , @xmath30 this happens for any initial conditions and even for large level displacement , @xmath31 ( provided that @xmath32 ) .",
    "note that the statistical mixture ( [ a04 ] ) is proportional to the unity matrix and therefore it remains the same in any basis .",
    "secondly , the environment can put the qubit in its ground state , for instance via photon or phonon emission .",
    "this process is usually referred to as relaxation . for a symmetric qubit we would have @xmath33 in contrast with decoherence , eq .",
    "( [ a04 ] ) , the relaxation process puts the qubit into a pure state .",
    "that implies that the corresponding density matrix can be always written as @xmath34 in a certain basis ( the basis of the qubit eigenstates ) .",
    "this is in fact the essential difference between decoherence and relaxation . with respect to elimination of the off - diagonal density matrix elements ,",
    "note that relaxation would eliminate these terms only in the qubit s eigenstates basis .",
    "in contrast , decoherence eliminates the off - diagonal density matrix element in any basis ( eq .",
    "( [ a04 ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , if the environment has some energy , it can put the qubit into an exited state .",
    "however , if the qubit is finally in a pure state , such excitation process generated by the environment affects the qubit in the same way as relaxation : it eliminates the off - diagonal density matrix elements only in a certain qubit s basis .",
    "therefore excitation of the qubit can be described phenomenologically on the same footing as relaxation .",
    "it is often claimed that decoherence is associated with an absence of energy transfer between the system and the environment , in contrast with relaxation ( excitation ) .",
    "this distinction is not generally valid .",
    "for instance , if the initial qubit state corresponds to the electron in the state @xmath35 , fig .  1 , the final state after decoherence corresponds to an equal distribution between the two dots , @xmath36 .",
    "in the case of @xmath37 , this process would require a large energy transfer between the qubit and the environment .",
    "therefore decoherence can be consistently defines as a process leading to a statistical mixture , where all states of the system have equal probabilities ( as in eq .",
    "( [ a04 ] ) ) .",
    "the relaxation ( excitation ) process can be described most simply by diagonalizing the qubit hamiltonian , eqs .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) , to obtain @xmath38 , where the operators @xmath39 are obtained by the corresponding rotation of the operators @xmath40 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are the ground ( symmetric ) and excited ( antisymmetric ) state energies .",
    "then the relaxation process can be described phenomenologically in the new qubit basis @xmath43 as    [ a06 ] @xmath44    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the relaxation rate .    in order to add decoherence , we return to the original qubit basis @xmath48 and add the damping term to the equation for the off - diagonal matrix elements , eq .",
    "( [ a03 ] ) .",
    "we arrive at the quantum rate equation describing the qubit s behavior in the presence of both decoherence and relaxation @xcite ,    [ a07 ] @xmath49(2\\sigma_{11}-1 ) + \\gamma_r{\\epsilon \\over 2\\tilde\\epsilon }   \\\\[5pt ]    & & \\dot\\sigma_{12}=-i\\epsilon\\sigma_{12 }    + \\left[i\\omega_0+\\gamma_r{\\kappa\\epsilon \\over 2\\tilde\\epsilon}\\right ]    ( 1 - 2\\sigma_{11 } ) + \\gamma_r\\left[\\kappa -{1\\over2}\\sigma_{12 }    -\\kappa^2(\\sigma_{12}+\\sigma_{21})\\right ] -{\\gamma_d\\over2}\\sigma_{12}\\ , , \\label{a07b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , these equations can be derived in the framework of a particular model , representing an electrostatic qubit interacting with the point - contact detector and the environment , described by the lee model hamiltonian @xcite .",

    "one finds that eqs .",

    "in contrast , our definition of decoherence and relaxation ( excitation ) is associated with two opposite effects of the environment on the qubit : the first drives it into a statistical mixture , whereas the second drives it into a pure state .",
    "we expect therefore that such a natural distinction between decoherence and relaxation would be more useful for finding a relation between these quantities and the environmental behavior than other alternative definitions of these quantities existing in the literature .    in general ,",
    "the two rates , @xmath67 , introduced in phenomenological equations  ( [ a07 ] ) , ( [ a08 ] ) , are consistent with our definitions of decoherence and relaxation .",

    "note that in this case the off - diagonal density - matrix elements , absent in eq.([static ] ) , would reappear in a different basis .",
