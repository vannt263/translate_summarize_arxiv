    "equations are one of the most natural algebraic objects ; they have been studied at all times and in all branches of mathematics and lie at its core . though the first equations to be considered were equations over integers , now equations are considered over a multitude of other algebraic structures : rational numbers , complex numbers , fields , rings , etc . since equations have always been an extremely important tool for a majority of branches of mathematics , their study developed into a separate , now classical , domain - algebraic geometry .",
    "the algebraic structures we work with in this paper are groups .",
    "we would like to mention some important results in the area that established the necessary basics and techniques and that motivate the questions addressed in this paper .",
    "though this historical introduction is several pages long , it is by no means complete and does not give a detailed account of the subject .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and to @xcite and references there for an extensive survey of the early history of equations in groups .",
    "it is hard to date the beginning of the theory of equations over groups , since even the classical word and conjugacy problems formulated by max dehn in 1911 can be interpreted as the compatibility problem for very simple equations .",
    "although the study of equations over groups now goes back almost a century , the foundations of a general theory of algebraic geometry over groups , analogous to the classical theory over commutative rings , were only set down relatively recently by g.  baumslag , a.  miasnikov and v.  remeslennikov , @xcite .    given a system of equations , the two main questions one can ask are whether the system is compatible and whether one can describe its set of solutions .",
    "it is these two questions that we now address .",
    "the solution of these problems is well - known for finitely generated abelian groups .",
    "v.  romankov showed that the compatibility problem is undecidable for nilpotent groups , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite n.  repin refined the result of romankov and showed that there exists a finitely presented nilpotent group for which the problem of recognising whether equations in one variable have solutions is undecidable .",
    "later , in @xcite , the author showed that for every non - abelian free nilpotent group of sufficiently large nilpotency class the compatibility problem for one - variable equations in undecidable .",
    "the compatibility problem is also undecidable for free metabelian groups , see @xcite .",
    "equations from the viewpoint of first - order logic are simply atomic formulas . therefore",
    ", recognising if a system of equations and inequations over a group has a solution is equivalent to the decidability of the universal theory ( or , which is equivalent , the existential theory ) of this group .",
    "this is one of the reasons why often these two problems are intimately related . in general ,",
    "both the compatibility problem and the problem of decidability of the universal theory are very deep .",
    "for instance , in @xcite romankov showed that the decidability of the universal theory of a free nilpotent group of class 2 is equivalent to the decidability of the universal theory of the field of rational numbers - a long - standing problem which , in turn , is equivalent to the diophantine problem over rational numbers . for solvable groups , o.  chapuis in @xcite shows that if the universal theory of a free solvable group of class greater than or equal to 3 is decidable then so is the diophantine problem over rational numbers .      in the case of free groups , both the compatibility problem and the problem of describing the solution set",
    "were long - standing problems . in this direction ,",
    "works of r.  lyndon and a.  malcev , which are precursors to the solution of these problems , are of special relevance .",
    "one of the first types of equations to be considered was one - variable equations . in @xcite",
    "r.  lyndon solved the compatibility problem and gave a description of the set of all solutions of a single equation in one variable ( over a free group ) .",
    "lyndon proved that the set of solutions of a single equation can be defined by a finite system of `` parametric words '' .",
    "these parametric words were complicated and the number of parameters on which they depended was restricted only by the type of each equation considered .",
    "further results were obtained by k.  appel @xcite and a.lorents @xcite , @xcite , who gave the exact form of the parametric words , and lorents extended the results to systems of equations with one variable .",
    "unfortunately appel s published proof has a gap , see p.87 of @xcite , and lorents announced his results without proof . in the year 2000 , i.  chiswell and v.  remeslennikov gave a complete argument , see @xcite . instead of giving a description in terms of parametric words",
    ", they described the structure of coordinate groups of irreducible algebraic sets ( in terms of their jsj - decompositions ) and , thereby , using the basic theory of algebraic geometry over free groups , they obtained a description of the solution set ( viewed as the set of homomorphisms from the coordinate group to a free group ) . recently , d.  bormotov , r.  gilman and a.  miasnikov in their paper @xcite , gave a polynomial time algorithm that produces a description of the solution set of one - variable equations .",
    "the parametric description of solutions of one - variable equations gave rise to a conjecture that the solution set of any system of equations could be described by a finite system of parametric words . in 1968 ,",
    "@xcite , appel showed that there are equations in three and more variables that can not be defined by a finite set of parametric words .",
    "therefore , the method of describing the solution set in terms of parametric words was shown to be limited .      in an attempt to generalise the results obtained for one - variable equations , a more general approach , involving parametric functions ,",
    "was suggested by yu .",
    "hmelevski . in his papers",
    "@xcite , @xcite , he gave a description of the solution set and proved the decidability of the compatibility problem of some systems of equations in two variables over a free group .",
    "this approach was later developed by yu .",
    "ozhigov in @xcite , who gave a description of the solution set and proved the decidability of the compatibility problem for arbitrary equations in two variables .    however , it turned out that this method was not general either .",
    "in @xcite , a.  razborov showed that there are equations whose set of solutions can not be represented by a superposition of a finite number of parametric functions .    recently , in @xcite , n.  touikan , using the approach developed by chiswell and remeslennikov for one - variable equations , gave a description ( in terms of the jsj - decomposition ) of coordinate groups of irreducible algebraic sets defined by a system of equations in two variables .",
    "because of their connections to surfaces and automorphisms thereof , quadratic equations have been studied since the beginning of the theory of equations over groups .",
    "the first quadratic equation to be studied was the commutator equation @xmath3=[a , b]$ ] , see @xcite .",
    "a description of the solution set of this equation was given in @xcite by a.  malcev in terms of parametric words in automorphisms and minimal solutions ( with respect to these automorphisms ) .",
    "malcev s powerful idea was later developed by l.  commerford and c.  edmunds , see @xcite , and by r.  grigorchuk and p.  kurchanov , see @xcite , into a general method of describing the set of solutions of all quadratic equations over a free group . a more geometric approach to this problem was given by m.  culler , see @xcite and a.  olshanskii @xcite .",
    "quadratic equations and malcev s idea to use automorphisms and minimal solutions play a key role in the modern approach to describing the solution set of arbitrary systems of equations over free groups .",
    "because of their importance , quadratic equations were considered over other groups .",
    "the decidability of compatibility problem for quadratic equations over one relator free product of groups was proved by a.  duncan in @xcite and over certain small cancellation groups by commerford in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "i.  lysnok reduces the description of solutions of quadratic equations over certain small cancellation groups to the description of solutions of quadratic equations in free groups .",
    "later , grigorchuk and lysnok gave a description of the solution set of quadratic equations over hyperbolic groups , see @xcite .",
    "a major breakthrough in the area was made by g.  makanin in his papers @xcite and @xcite . in his work",
    ", makanin devised a process for deciding whether or not an arbitrary system of equations @xmath4 over a free monoid ( over a free group ) is compatible .",
    "later , using similar techniques , makanin proved that the universal theory of a free group is decidable , see @xcite .",
    "makanin s result on decidability of the universal theory of a free group together with an important result of yu .",
    "merzlyakov @xcite on quantifier elimination for positive formulae over free groups proves that the positive theory of a free group is decidable .",
    "makanin s ideas were developed in many directions .",
    "remarkable progress was made by a.  razborov . in his work",
    "@xcite , @xcite , razborov refined makanin s process and used automorphisms and minimal solutions to give a complete description of the set of solutions of an arbitrary system of equations over a free group in terms of , what is now called , makanin - razborov diagrams ( or @xmath5-diagrams ) . in their work @xcite , o.  kharlampovich and a.  miasnikov gave an important insight into razborov s process and provided algebraic semantics for it . using the process and having understanding of radicals of quadratic equations",
    ", the authors showed that the solution set of a system of equations can be canonically represented by the union of solution sets of a finite family of ntq systems and gave an effective embedding of finitely generated fully residually free groups into coordinate groups of ntq systems ( @xmath6-residually free towers ) , thereby giving a characterisation of such groups .",
    "then , using bass - serre theory , they proved that finitely generated fully residually free groups are finitely presented and that one can effectively find a cyclic splitting of such groups .",
    "analogous results were proved by z.  sela using geometric techniques , see @xcite .",
    "later , kharlampovich and myasnikov in @xcite and sela in @xcite , developed makanin - razborov diagrams for systems of equations with parameters over a free group .",
    "these makanin - razborov diagrams encode the makanin - razborov diagrams of the systems of equations associated with each specialisation of the parameters .",
    "this construction plays a key role in a generalisation of merzlyakov s theorem , in other words , in the proof of existence of skolem functions for certain types of formulae ( for ntq systems of equations ) , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these results are an important piece of the solution of two well - known conjectures formulated by a.  tarski around 1945 : the first of them states that the elementary theories of non - abelian free groups of different ranks coincide ; and the second one states that the elementary theory of a free group is decidable .",
    "these problems were recently solved by o.  kharlampovich and a.  miasnikov in @xcite and the first one was independently solved by z.  sela in @xcite .    in another direction ,",
    "makanin s result ( on decidability of equations over a free monoid ) was developed by k.schulz , see @xcite , who proved that the compatibility problem of equations with regular constraints over a free monoid is decidable .",
    "later v.  diekert , c.  gutirrez and c.  hagenah , see @xcite , reduced the compatibility problem of systems of equations over a free group with rational constraints to compatibility problem of equations with regular constraints over a free monoid .    since then , one of the most successful methods of proving the decidability of the compatibility problem for groups ( monoids ) has been to reduce it to the compatibility problem over a free group ( monoid ) with constraints .",
    "the reduction of compatibility problem for torsion - free hyperbolic groups to free groups was made by e.  rips and z.  sela in @xcite ; for relatively hyperbolic groups with virtually abelian parabolic subgroups by f.  dahmani in @xcite ; for partially commutative monoids by yu .",
    "matiasevich in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; for partially commutative groups by v.  diekert and a.  muscholl in @xcite ; for graph products of groups by v.  diekert and m.  lohrey in @xcite ; and for hnn - extensions with finite associated subgroups and for amalgamated products with finite amalgamated subgroups by m.  lohrey and g.  snizergues in @xcite .",
    "the complexity of makanin s algorithm has received a lot of attention . the best result about arbitrary systems of equations over monoids is due to w.  plandowski . in a series of two papers",
    "@xcite he gave a new approach to the compatibility problem of systems of equations over a free monoid and showed that this problem is in pspace .",
    "this approach was further extended by diekert , gutirrez and hagenah , see @xcite to systems of equations over free groups .",
    "recently , o.  kharlampovich , i.  lysnok , a.  myasnikov and n.  touikan have shown that solving quadratic equations over free groups is np - complete , @xcite .",
    "another important development of the ideas of makanin is due to e.  rips and is now known as the rips machine . in his work , rips interprets makanin s algorithm in terms of partial isometries of real intervals , which leads him to a classification theorem of finitely generated groups that act freely on @xmath7-trees .",
    "a complete proof of rips theorem was given by d.  gaboriau , g.  levitt , and f.  paulin , see @xcite , and , independently , by m.  bestvina and m.  feighn , see @xcite , who also generalised rips result to give a classification theorem of groups that have a stable action on @xmath7-trees .",
    "recently , f.  dahmani and v.  guirardel announced the decidability of the compatibility problem for virtually free groups generalising rips machine .",
    "the existence of analogues of makanin - razborov diagrams has been proven for different groups . in @xcite , for torsion - free hyperbolic groups by z.  sela ; in @xcite , for torsion - free relatively hyperbolic groups relative to free abelian subgroups by d.  groves ; for fully residually free ( or limit ) groups in @xcite , by o.  kharlampovich and a.  miasnikov and in @xcite , by e.  alibegovi .",
    "other well - known problems and results were studied in relation to equations in groups . in analogy to galois theory ,",
    "the problem of adjoining roots of equations was considered in the first half of the twentieth century leading to the classical construction of an hnn - extension of a group @xmath2 introduced by b.  higman , b.  neumann and h.  neumann in @xcite as a construction of an extension of a group @xmath2 in which the `` conjugacy '' equation @xmath8 is compatible .",
    "another example is the characterisation of the structure of elements @xmath9 for which an equation of the form @xmath10 is compatible , also known as the endomorphism problem .",
    "a well known result in this direction is the solution of the endomorphism problem for the commutator equation @xmath3=g$ ] in a free group obtained in @xcite by m.  wicks in terms of , what now are called , wicks forms .",
    "wicks forms were generalised to free products of groups and to higher genus by a.  vdovina in @xcite , to hyperbolic groups by s.  fulthorp in @xcite and to partially commutative groups by s.  shestakov , see @xcite . the endomorphism problem for many other types of equations over free groups",
    "was studied by p.  schupp , see @xcite , c.  edmunds , see @xcite , @xcite and was generalised to free products of groups by l.  comerford and c.  edmunds , see @xcite .",
    "we now focus on equations over partially commutative groups . recall that a partially commutative group @xmath0 is a group given by a presentation of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a subset of the set @xmath13 \\mid i , j=1 , \\dots , { \\mathfrak{r } }",
    ", i \\neq j\\}$ ] .",
    "this means that the only relations imposed on the generators are commutation of some of the generators . in particular , both free abelian groups and free groups are partially commutative groups .    as we have mentioned above ,",
    "given a system of equations , the two main questions one can ask are whether the system is compatible and whether one can describe its set of solutions .",
    "it is known that the compatibility problem for systems of equations over partially commutative groups is decidable , see @xcite . moreover , the universal ( existential ) and positive theories of partially commutative groups are also decidable , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but , on the other hand , until now there were not even any partial results known about the description of the solution sets of systems of equations over partially commutative groups .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of partially commutative groups , other problems , involving particular equations , have been studied .",
    "we would like to mention two papers by s.  shestakov , see @xcite and @xcite , where the author solves the endomorphism problem for the equations @xmath3=g$ ] and @xmath14 correspondingly , and a result of j.  crisp and b.  wiest from @xcite stating that partially commutative groups satisfy vaught s conjecture , i.e. that if a tuple @xmath15 of elements from @xmath0 is a solution of the equation @xmath16 , then @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 pairwise commute .    in this paper , we effectively construct an analogue of makanin - razborov diagrams and use it to give a description of the solution set of systems of equations over partially commutative groups .",
    "it seems to the authors that the importance of the work presented in this paper lies not only in the construction itself but in the fact that it enables consideration of analogues of the ( numerous ) consequences of the classical makanin - razborov process in more general circumstances .",
    "the classes of groups for which makanin - razborov diagrams have been constructed so far are generalisations of free groups with a common feature : all of them are csa - groups ( see lemma 2.5 in @xcite ) . recall that a group is called csa if every maximal abelian subgroup is malnormal , see @xcite , or , equivalently , a group is csa if every non - trivial abelian subgroup is contained in a unique maximal abelian subgroup . in proposition 9 in @xcite , it is proved that if a group is csa , then it is commutative transitive ( the commutativity relation is transitive ) and thus the centralisers of its ( non - trivial ) elements are abelian , it is directly indecomposable , has no non - abelian normal subgroups , has trivial centre , has no non - abelian solvable subgroups and has no non - abelian baumslag - solitar subgroups .",
    "this shows that the csa property imposes strong restrictions on the structure of the group and , especially , on the structure of the centralisers of its elements .",
    "therefore , numerous classes of groups , even geometric , are not csa .",
    "the csa property is important in the constructions of analogues of makanin - razborov diagrams constructed before .",
    "the fact that partially commutative groups are _ not _ csa , conceptually , shows that this property is not essential for constructing makanin - razborov diagrams and that the approach developed in this paper opens the possibility for other groups to be taken in consideration : graph products of groups , particular types of hnn - extensions ( amalgamated products ) , partially commutative - by - finite , fully residually partially commutative groups , particular types of small cancellation groups , torsion - free relatively hyperbolic groups , some torsion - free cat(0 ) groups and more .    on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned above , schulz proved that makanin s process to decide the compatibility problem of equations carries over to systems of equations over a free monoid with regular constraints . in our construction , we show that razborov s results can be generalised to systems of equations ( over a free monoid ) with constraints characterised by certain axioms .",
    "therefore , two natural problems arise : to understand for which classes of groups the description of solutions of systems of equations reduces to this setting , and to understand which other constraints can be considered in the construction of makanin - razborov diagrams .    in another direction ,",
    "the makanin - razborov process is one of the main ingredients in the effective construction of the jsj - decomposition for fully residually free groups and in the characterisation of finitely generated fully residually free groups as given by kharlampovich and myasnikov in @xcite and @xcite , correspondingly .",
    "therefore , the process we construct in this paper may be one of the techniques one can use to understand the structure of finitely generated fully residually partially commutative groups , or , which in this case is equivalent , of finitely generated residually partially commutative groups , and thus , in particular , the structure of all finitely generated residually free groups .    in the case of free groups",
    ", rips machine leads to a classification theorem of finitely generated groups that have a stable action on @xmath7-trees .",
    "therefore , our process may be useful for understanding finitely generated groups that act in a certain way ( that can be axiomatised ) on an @xmath7-tree .",
    "a more distant hope is that the process may lead to a classification of finitely generated groups that act freely on a ( nice ) cat(0 ) space .",
    "the structure of subgroups of partially commutative groups is very complex , see @xcite , and some of the subgroups exhibit odd finiteness properties , see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent results on partially commutative groups suggest that the attempts to generalise some of the well - known results for free groups have been , at least to some extent , successful .",
    "we would like to mention here the recent progress of r.  charney and k.  vogtmann on the outer space of partially commutative groups , of m.  day on the generalisation of peak - reduction algorithm ( whitehead s theorem ) for partially commutative groups , and of a number of authors on the structure of automorphism groups of partially commutative groups , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this and the current paper makes us optimistic about the future of this emerging area .    to get a global vision of the long process we describe in this paper , we would like to begin by a brief comparison of the method of solving equations over a free monoid ( as the reader will see the setting we reduce the study of systems of equations over partially commutative groups is rather similar to it ) to gaussian elimination in linear algebra .",
    "though , technically very different , we want to point out that the general guidelines of both methods have a number of common features .",
    "given a system of @xmath20 linear equations in @xmath21 variables over a field @xmath22 , the algorithm in linear algebra firstly encodes this system as an @xmath23 matrix with entries in @xmath22 .",
    "then it uses elementary gauss transformations of matrices ( row permutation , multiplication of a row by a scalar , etc ) in a particular order to take the matrix to a row - echelon form , and then it produces a description of the solution set of the system of linear equations with the associated matrix in row - echelon form .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm has the following property : every solution of the ( system of equations corresponding to the ) matrix in row - echelon form gives rise to a solution of the original system and , conversely , every solution of the original system is induced by a solution of the ( system of equations corresponding to the ) matrix in row - echelon form .",
    "let us compare this algorithm with its group - theoretic counterpart , a variation of which we present in this paper",
    ".    given a system of equations over a free monoid , we introduce a combinatorial object - a generalised equation , and establish a correspondence between systems of equations over a free monoid and generalised equations ( for the purposes of this introduction , the reader may think of generalised equations as just systems of equations over a monoid ) .",
    "graphic representations of generalised equations will play the role of matrices in linear algebra .",
    "we then define certain transformations of generalised equations , see sections [ se:5.1 ] and [ se:5.2half ] .",
    "one of the differences is that in the case of systems of linear equations , applying an elementary gauss transformation to a matrix one obtains a _",
    "single _ matrix . in our case , applying some of the ( elementary and derived ) transformations to a generalised equation one gets a finite family of generalised equations .",
    "therefore , the method we describe here , results in an oriented rooted tree of generalised equations instead of a sequence of matrices .    a case - based algorithm , described in section [ se:5.2 ] , applies transformations in a specific order to generalised equations . the branch of the algorithm terminates , when the generalised equation obtained is `` simple '' ( there is a formal definition of being `` simple '' ) .",
    "the algorithm then produces a description of the set of solutions of `` simple '' generalised equations .",
    "one of the main differences is that a branch of the procedure described may be _ infinite_. using particular automorphisms of coordinate groups of generalised equations as parameters , one can prove that a finite tree is sufficient to give a description of the solution set .",
    "thus , the parametrisation of the solutions set will be given using a finite tree , recursive groups of automorphisms of finitely many coordinate groups of generalised equations and solutions of `` simple '' generalised equations .",
    "we now briefly describe the content of each of the sections of the paper .    in section [ sec : prelim ]",
    "we establish the basics we will need throughout the paper .",
    "the goal of section [ sec : red ] is to present the set of solutions of a system of equations over a partially commutative group as a union of sets of solutions of finitely many constrained generalised equations over a free monoid .",
    "the family of solutions of the collection constructed of generalised equations describes all solutions of the initial system over a partially commutative group .",
    "the term `` constrained generalised equation over a free monoid ( partially commutative monoid ) '' can be misleading , since their solutions are not tuples of elements from a free monoid ( partially commutative monoid ) , but tuples of reduced elements of the partially commutative group , that satisfy the equalities in a free monoid ( partially commutative monoid ) .",
    "this reduction is performed in two steps .",
    "firstly , we use an analogue of the notion of a cancellation tree for free groups to reduce the study of systems of equations over a partially commutative group to the study of constrained generalised equations over a partially commutative monoid .",
    "we show that van kampen diagrams over partially commutative groups can be taken to a `` standard form '' and therefore the set of solutions of a given system of equations over a partially commutative group defines only finitely many types of van kampen diagram in standard form , i.e. finitely many different cancellation schemes .",
    "for each of these cancellation schemes , we then construct a constrained generalised equation over a partially commutative monoid .",
    "we further show that to a given generalised equation over a partially commutative monoid one can associate a finite collection of ( constrained ) generalised equations over a free monoid .",
    "the family of solutions of the generalised equations from this collection describes all solutions of the initial generalised equation over a partially commutative monoid .",
    "this reduction relies on the ideas of yu .",
    "matiyasevich , see @xcite , v.  diekert and a.  muscholl , see @xcite , that state that there are only finitely many ways to take a product of words in the trace monoid ( written in normal form ) into normal form .",
    "we apply these results to reduce the study of solutions of generalised equations over a partially commutative monoid to the study of solutions of constrained generalised equations over a free monoid .    in section [ se:5 ] in order to describe the solution set of a constrained generalised equation over a free monoid we describe a branching rewriting process for constrained generalised equations . for a given generalised equation , this branching process results in a",
    "locally finite , possibly infinite , oriented rooted tree .",
    "the vertices of this tree are labelled by ( constrained ) generalised equations over a free monoid .",
    "its edges are labelled by epimorphisms of the corresponding coordinate groups .",
    "moreover , for every solution @xmath24 of the original generalised equation , there exists a path in the tree from the root vertex to another vertex @xmath25 and a solution @xmath26 of the generalised equation corresponding to @xmath25 such that the solution @xmath24 is a composition of the epimorphisms corresponding to the edges in the tree and the solution @xmath26 .",
    "conversely , to any path from the root to a vertex @xmath25 in the tree , and any solution @xmath26 of the generalised equation labelling @xmath25 , there corresponds a solution of the original generalised equation .",
    "the tree described is , in general , infinite . in lemma",
    "[ 3.2 ] we give a characterisation of the three types of infinite branches that it may contain : namely linear , quadratic and general .",
    "the aim of the remainder of the paper is , basically , to define the automorphism groups of coordinate groups that are used in the parametrisation of the solution sets and to prove that , using these automorphisms all solutions can be described by a finite tree .    sections [ sec : minsol ] and [ sec : periodstr ] contain technical results used in section [ se:5.3 ] .    in section [ sec : minsol ]",
    "we use automorphisms to introduce a reflexive , transitive relation on the set of solutions of a generalised equation .",
    "we use this relation to introduce the notion of a minimal solution and describe the behaviour of minimal solutions with respect to transformations of generalised equations .    in section",
    "[ sec : periodstr ] we introduce the notion of periodic structure .",
    "informally , a periodic structure is an object one associates to a generalised equation that has a solution that contains subwords of the form @xmath27 for arbitrary large @xmath21 .",
    "the aim of this section is two - fold . on one hand , to understand the structure of the coordinate group of such a generalised equation and to define a certain finitely generated subgroup of its automorphism group . on the other hand , to prove that , using automorphisms from the automorphism group described , either one can bound the exponent of periodicity @xmath21 or one can obtain a solution of a proper generalised equation .",
    "section [ se:5.3 ] contains the core of the proof of the main results . in this section",
    "we deal with the three types of infinite branches and construct a finite oriented rooted subtree @xmath28 of the infinite tree described above .",
    "this tree has the property that for every leaf either one can trivially describe the solution set of the generalised equation assigned to it , or from every solution of the generalised equation associated to it , one gets a solution of a proper generalised equation using automorphisms defined in section [ sec : periodstr ] .",
    "the strategy for the linear and quadratic branches is common : firstly , using a combinatorial argument , we prove that in such infinite branches a generalised equation repeats thereby giving rise to an automorphism of the coordinate group .",
    "then , we show that such automorphisms are contained in a recursive group of automorphisms .",
    "finally , we prove that minimal solutions with respect to this recursive group of automorphisms factor through sub - branches of bounded height .",
    "the treatment for the general branch is more complex .",
    "we show that using automorphisms defined for quadratic branches and automorphisms defined in section [ sec : periodstr ] , one can take any solution to a solution of a proper generalised equation or to a solution of bounded length .",
