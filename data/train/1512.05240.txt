    "the aim of statistical mechanics is to obtain a qualitative understanding of natural phenomena of phase transitions by the study of simplified models , often built on a lattices . in general the hamiltonian of a model of statistical mechanics",
    "is left invariant by the lattice symmetries : a prototypical example being the ising model describing a ferromagnet .",
    "however , one might argue that materials which are found in nature are usually not completely homogeneous and for this reason , physicists where led to considering systems in which the interaction terms , for example the potentials between nearest neighbor spins , are chosen by sampling a random field  which we call _ disorder _  with good ergodic properties , often even a field of independent identically distributed random variables .",
    "an important question which arises is thus whether the results concerning the phase transition obtained for a model with homogeneous interactions referred to as _ the pure system _ ( e.g.  the onsager solution of the two dimensional ising model ) remain valid when a system where randomness of a very small amplitude is introduced .    in @xcite",
    "a.  b.  harris , gave a strikingly simple heuristical argument , based on renormalization theory consideration , to predict the effect of the introduction of a small amount of the system : in substance harris criterion predict that if the phase transition of the pure system is sufficiently smooth , it will not be affected by small perturbation ( disorder is then said to be _ irrelevant _ ) , while in the other cases the behavior of the system is affected by an arbitrary small addition of randomness ( disorder is _ relevant _ ) . to be complete ,",
    "let us mention also the existence of a boundary case for which the criterion yields no prediction ( the _ marginal disorder _ case ) .",
    "the criterion however does not give a precise prediction concerning the nature of the phase transition when the disorder is relevant .",
    "the mathematical verification of the harris criterion is a very challenging task in general . in the first place",
    ", it can only be considered for the few special models of statistical mechanics for which we have a rigorous understanding of the critical properties of the pure system . in the last twenty years",
    "this question has been addressed , first by theoretical physicists ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and then by mathematicians @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews ) , for a simple model of a 1-dimensional interface interacting with a substrate : for this model the interface is given by the graph of a random walk which takes random energy rewards when it touches a defect line . in this case , the pure system has the remarkable quality of being what physicists call _ exactly solvable _ , meaning that there exists an explicit expression for the free energy @xcite .",
    "this model under consideration in the present paper can be seen as a high - dimension generalization of the rw pinning model .",
    "the random walk is replaced by a random field @xmath10 , and the random energies are collected when the graph of the field is close to the hyper - plane @xmath11 . while the pure model is not exactly solvable in that case , it has been studied in details and the nature of the phase transition is well known @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the study of the disordered version of the model is much more recent @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", we gave a close to complete description of the free energy diagram of the disordered model when @xmath8 :    * we identified the value of the disordered critical point , which is shown to coincide with that of the associated annealed model , regardless of the amplitude of disorder .",
    "* we proved that for gaussian disorder , the behavior of the free energy close to @xmath2 is quadratic , in contrasts with the annealed model for which the transitition is of first order . * in case of general disorder , we proved that the quadratic upper - bound still holds , and found a polynomial lower bound with a different exponent .",
    "let us stress that the heuristic of our proof strongly suggests that the behavior of the free energy should be quadratic for a suitable large class of environments ( those who satisfy a second moment assumption similar to ) .    in the present paper , we choose to attack the case @xmath12 , for which only limited results were obtained so far .",
    "we have seen in the proof of the main result @xcite that the critical behavior of the model is very much related to the extremal process of the field .",
    "the quadratic behavior of the free - energy in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.2 ) comes from the fact that high level sets of the gaussian free field for @xmath8 look like a uniformly random set with a fixed density ( see @xcite ) . in dimension @xmath13 however , the behavior of the extremal process is much more intricate , with a phenomenon of clustering in the level sets ( see @xcite or also @xcite for a similar phenomenon for branching brownian motion ) .",
    "this yields results of a very different nature .",

    "however , we are able to prove also that the critical behavior of the free energy is not quadratic , @xmath65 is becomes smaller than any power of @xmath1 in a ( positive ) neighborhood of @xmath109 .",

    "* we have @xmath111 more precisely , there exists @xmath112 such that for all @xmath113 @xmath114    we do not believe that either bound in is sharp .",
    "however it seems to us that the strategy used for the lower - bound is closer to capture the behavior of the field .",
    "we believe that the true behavior of the free energy might be given by @xmath115 while a lower bound of this type might be achieved by optimizing the proof presented in the present paper ( but this would require some significant technical work ) , we do not know how to obtain a significant improvement on the upper - bound .      like in @xcite , it worthwhile to notice that the proof of the results of the present paper can be adapted to a model for with a different localization mechanism .",
    "it is the analog of the model of a copolymer in the proximity of the interface between selective solvents , see @xcite and references therein . for this model given a realization of @xmath58 and two fixed parameters @xmath116 ,",
    "the measure is defined via the following density @xmath117 where we assume @xmath118 .",
    "a natural interpretation of the model is that the graph of @xmath119 models a membrane lying between two solvents @xmath120 and @xmath121 which fill the upper and lower half - space respectively : for each point of the graph , the quantity @xmath122 describes the energetic preference for one solvent of the corresponding portion of the membrane ( a if @xmath123 and b if @xmath124 ) . as @xmath1 is positive and @xmath125",
    "is centered , there is , on average , a preference for solvent a ( by symetry this causes no loss of generality ) .    if @xmath126 $ ]",
    ", there is a non - trivial competition between energy and entropy : the interaction with the solvent gives an incentive for the field @xmath24 to stay close to the interface so that its sign can match as much as possible that of @xmath127 , but such a strategy might be valid only if the energetic rewards it brings is superior to the entropic cost of the localization .",
    "a more evident analogy with the pinning measure can be made by observing that we can write @xmath128 where @xmath129 , that is @xmath130 is the indicator function that @xmath131 is in the lower half plane .",

    "[ th : cop ] for @xmath136 , for any @xmath137 we have @xmath138 moreover , with @xmath65 replaced by @xmath139 , holds true .",
    "note that while pure co - membrane model ( i.e.  with no disorder ) displays a first order phase transition in @xmath1 , the above result underlines that the transition becomes of infinite order in the presence of an arbitrary small quantity of disorder .",
    "note that this result differs both from the one obtained in dimension @xmath8 ( for which the transition is shown to be quadratic at least for gaussian environment ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.5 ) ) , and that in dimension @xmath80 : for the copolymer model based on renewals presented in @xcite , @xmath140 is in most cases a strict upper - bound on @xmath135 ( see e.g.  the results in @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th : cop ] is not given in the paper but it can be obtained with straightforward modification , from that of theorem [ mainres ] .",
    "the proof of the upper - bound and of the lower - bound on the free energy presented in equation are largely independent .",

    "the details of these steps are covered in section [ liminouze ] and [ intelinside ] .    for the proof of both the upper and the lower - bound",
    ", we need fine results on the structure of the free field .",
    "although these results or their proof can not directly be extracted from the existing literature , our proof ( especially the techniques developed in section [ intelinside ] ) is largely based on tools that were developed in the numerous study on extrema and extremal processes of the two dimensional free field @xcite and other @xmath141-correlated gaussian processes @xcite ( the list of references being far from being complete ) . in particular for the lower bound",
