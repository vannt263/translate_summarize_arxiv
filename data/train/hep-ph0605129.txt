    "the interference effects between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 decay amplitudes in the time - dependent asymmetries of @xmath7 decaying into @xmath8 and @xmath9 final states allow for the determination of @xmath10+@xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless the extraction of @xmath10+@xmath11 depends upon the knowledge of the absolute value of the ratio ( @xmath12 ) of the amplitudes ( e.g. : @xmath13 ) and of the strong phase difference , which nave not been determined experimentally so far .",
    "furthermore , the ratio @xmath12 is expected to be rather small , of the order of @xmath14 0.02 . in addition the extraction of 2@xmath0 from the two - body decays suffers from a eight - fold ambiguity .",
    "one can estimate the ratio @xmath12 by deducing for instance the branching fraction @xmath15 from the measured branching fraction @xmath16 .",
    "this approach is valid up to a theoretical uncertainty related to su(3 ) breaking effects and to the size of annihilation processes which do not contribute to @xmath17 final states . using all the experimental constraints  @xcite,@xcite ,",
    "a tentative extraction of 2@xmath0 has been made , attributing 100@xmath18 uncertainty to these assumptions , and getting @xcite : 2@xmath19 ( the @xmath20 in front of the central value refers to the fact that 2@xmath0 is determined up to a @xmath21 ambiguity ) .",
    "another way of measuring @xmath22 is to perform a time dependent dalitz analysis of the three - body decay : , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "this method allows in principle to overcome the disadvantages encountered in the determination of 2@xmath0 from @xmath8 or @xmath9 decays .",
    "first of all , in the region of the dalitz plane where most of the interference takes place the value of the ratio @xmath12 is expected to be of the order of 0.4 since it involves @xmath5 and @xmath6 colour suppressed diagrams .",
    "furthermore @xmath22 can be measured with only a two - fold ambiguity as explained in @xcite .",
    "in addition , this method could be theoretically clean , because the strong amplitudes and phases can be , in principle , measured from data .",
    "early studies can be found in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a feasibility study of the analysis under realistic conditions . unlike to previous studies",
    ", we have used a model for the dalitz structure of the decays that uses the latest experimental measurements .",
    "we have also included realistic @xmath23 tagging performances and explored the possibility of fitting the strong amplitudes and phases of the most relevant interfering resonances by using both the tagged and untagged events .",
    "finally we have studied the effect of background in the determination of @xmath22 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath22 can be achieved through a study of the time - dependent evolution of decay sensitive to that phase .",
    "this can only be performed on tagged events , that means events for which the original flavour of the reconstructed @xmath7 is known . in a @xmath7 factory",
    "this is possible through the determination of the flavour of the other @xmath7 in the event since the two @xmath7 mesons are produced in a coherent @xmath24 state . thus if we determine that at a time @xmath25 we have a , then the other @xmath7 in the event at the same time @xmath25 is a . in practice ,",
    "one of the @xmath7 ( the ) is reconstructed in a flavour tagging state .",
    "the time - dependent decay rates taking into account cp violation for a ( @xmath26 ) or ( @xmath27 ) tagging meson are given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lifetime , @xmath30 is the mixing frequency and @xmath31 a normalisation factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is non - zero if there is mixing - induced cp violation , while a non - zero value for @xmath33 would indicate direct cp violation .",
    "the final state @xmath1 can be reached through the diagrams shown in figure [ diagrams ] and considering the mixing .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 of eq .",
    "[ eq : fplus ] will depend on the position in the @xmath7 dalitz plot .",
    "indeed , a given bin in the dalitz plot gets contributions from amplitudes and strong phases of @xmath34 and @xmath35 transitions .",
    "the model assumed for the decay parametrises the amplitude @xmath36 at each point @xmath37 of the dalitz plot as a sum of two - body decay matrix elements and a non - resonant term according to the following expression : @xmath38    where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) indicates the cabibbo allowed ( suppressed ) decay in each point @xmath37 of the dalitz plot .",
    "each term of the sum is parametrised with an amplitude ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) and a phase ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath45 gives the lorentz invariant expression for the matrix element of a resonance @xmath46 as a function of the position @xmath37 in the @xmath7 dalitz plot ; the functional dependence varies with the spin @xmath47 of the resonance according to the isobar model  @xcite .",
    "the total phase and amplitude are arbitrary .",
    "we have chosen amplitude unity and phase zero for the mode @xmath48 decaying into @xmath49 .",
    "+ four transitions have to be considered associated to probabilities of connecting a or initial state to a @xmath50 or @xmath51 final states .",
    "they are indicated in table  [ tab : sumamp ] .",
    ".__summary of the amplitudes involved in the analysis .",
    "the index @xmath37 refers to the position in the dalitz plot .",
    "the third column is derived from the second one using cp transformation . _ _ [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     from this study the first conclusion is that the present measurements @xcite,@xcite are not sufficient to fix the dalitz model and give a precise indication on the error which can be obtained on 2@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the precision on @xmath22 strongly depends on the variation of the branching fractions of neutral @xmath7 into @xmath52 states within the measured errors .",
    "there is also some dependence on the presence or not of non resonant contributions and on the values of strong phases for the most relevant resonances .",
    "we also show the impact of the variation of @xmath53 from 0.3 to 0.5 .    the model using only a non resonant contribution for the @xmath54 component",
    "is also given as a reference since it was taken as example in the feasibility study presented in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding error on 2@xmath0 is a factor 3 - 6 better with respect the one obtained using a set of realistic decay models .",
    "this model has not been further considered as it is contradiction with present data @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this method is the possibility to have a model independent determination of @xmath22 by fitting the parameters of the decay model .",
    "we consider a sample corresponding to 1 of collected statistics .",
    "the reference error is obtained as previously by fitting only @xmath22 and by fixing all the other parameters .",
    "we try to progressively release the other parameters which characterise the decay model .",
    "first we relax the @xmath52 and the non - resonant @xmath55 components .",
    "we managed to fit the three amplitudes and phases and the error on @xmath22 increases by 10@xmath18 .",
    "so far we have used only tagged events since they are the only one carrying information on @xmath22 . nevertheless also untagged events could play an important role in fitting the decay model parameters . in practice",
    "we can add the following term to the likelihood given in eq.[timelikeli ] : @xmath56 the same fit is repeated with untagged events included in the sample .",
    "the error on @xmath22 decreases by about 10@xmath18 . in the following untagged events are used .",
    "+ the following test is to leave free the strong phases of the @xmath52 and the non - resonant @xmath54 components . in this case",
    "the error on @xmath22 increases by about 20@xmath18 .",
    "an extra increase of 10@xmath18 is obtained if the amplitudes of those components are further left free to vary in the fit .",
    "one can also try to estimate the effect of the presence of the background in the dalitz plot . for simplicity",
    "we take a flat background over the dalitz plot , being aware that reality could be different .",
    "we assume that the discrimination between signal and background events is performed using additional variables ( _ e .",
    "g. _ the reconstructed @xmath7 mass ) and we fix the signal over background ratio in the cp violation fit .",
    "we run our simulation by considering a signal over background ( s / b ) ratio of 30@xmath18 or 50@xmath18 .",
    "the result is that the error on @xmath22 increases by 25@xmath18 and 50@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "furthermore if s / b is equal to 50@xmath18 it seems difficult to perform a fit where all @xmath55 and @xmath54 @xmath52 and the non - resonant components are left free in the fit . + as by - product of this analysis , the dalitz model can be fitted from the data if the level of background is not too large .",
    "the @xmath55 @xmath52 related amplitudes and phases can be fitted with precisions lying between 20 - 30@xmath18 . furthermore both the phases and the amplitudes for @xmath52 from @xmath54 processes are determined with errors which can go up to 50@xmath18 .",
    "in addition the excited k resonnaces ( @xmath57 ) which concerns only @xmath55 processes can be precisely determined from data with relative uncertainties better than 25@xmath18 .",
    "we have performed a full feasibility study for measuring @xmath22 with time dependent dalitz analysis using @xmath1 final states . for this study",
    "a realistic decay model , based on the available experimental information has been elaborated .",
    "we conclude that the error on @xmath22 strongly depends on the decay model and that the currently available experimental information is not enough for a precise estimate . by varying the different parameters in the currently allowed range ,",
    "the error on @xmath22 can vary within a factor of about 2.5 .",
    "only a complete dalitz analysis could tell us where we stand .",
    "this is possible on data .",
    "+ in fact we have shown that if the level of background is not too large ( @xmath58 ) the full decay model can be obtained by fitting the dalitz plot using both tagged and untagged events .    all the amplitudes and strong phases can be fitted and , in case of the dalitz decay model given in table [ tab : resonances ] , the precision on @xmath22 could be of about 50@xmath18 with 500 and should not be limited by the systematical uncertainties .",
    "this implies that the precision on 2@xmath59 could be reduced at few percent level in case this analysis is performed at a high luminosity b factory @xcite .",
