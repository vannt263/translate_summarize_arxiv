    "the qso luminosity function is typically fit to a double power law of the form    @xmath8    ( in magnitudes ) where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the bright and faint end slopes , respectively . at high",
    "redshift ( @xmath11 ) , initial indications are that the shape of the qso luminosity function ( qlf ) may be changing .",
    "hunt et al ( 2004)(hereafter , h04 ) , in a search of faint qsos at @xmath1 , find a very shallow faint end slope @xmath12 . at the bright end , richards et al .",
    "( 2006 , in press ) show that the slope of the bright end is getting shallower with redshift between @xmath13 .",
    "given the importance of qso luminosity functions in constrainting galaxy evolution models , growth of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , and qso contribution to the ionization of hi and heii in the igm , these initial indications of a changing qlf warrant larger , deeper surveys to better constrain the high redshift qlf .",
    "it is difficult to obtain a complete qso luminosity function at @xmath14 for two reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the colors of qsos at @xmath15 coincide with those of main sequence stars , resulting in unreliable samples .",
    "therefore , targeted follow - up spectroscopy or imaging in redder bands ( near - ir ) is usually needed to distinguish interlopers from qsos .",
    "( 2 ) surveys of faint qsos at these redshifts require fairly deep imaging ( @xmath16 , for accurate point source determination ) over wide areas ( @xmath17 deg@xmath3 ) to find large numbers .",
    "the swire legacy survey ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 ) , with irac & mips ( 3.6 - 160@xmath18 m ) imaging over 49 deg@xmath3 removes both of these obstacles .",
    "the number of ly@xmath9 absorbers increases rapidly toward higher redshift .",
    "the lyman line and continuum absorption from these systems significantly depresses the continuum of high redshift objects blueward of ly@xmath9 ( 1216 ) .",
    "our optical color selection looks for this flux decrement ( amongst point sources ) as it redshifts into the @xmath0-band at @xmath19 , causing a red @xmath20 color in a source with an otherwise blue continuum .",
    "the color criteria were chosed to select a qso with a 2@xmath21 deviation in uv spectral slope and are given in eq . 1 and plotted in figure 1 .",
    "typically , high redshift qso surveys avoid the color - space of main sequence stars , but our selection will include many a & f stars as we expect to remove these with infrared colors .",
    "@xmath22    as shown by lacy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and stern et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , agn candidates can be selected by their red irac colors .",
    "unfortunately , we do not expect to detect the majority of @xmath23 qsos at these redshifts in the two longest wavelength irac bands ( 5.8 & 8.0@xmath18 m ) .",
    "therefore , we only use channels 1 & 2 ( hereafter , irac1 & irac2 ) since they are two magnitudes more sensitive given the same exposure time . in figure 1",
    "the irac colors of all point sources with @xmath24 in en1 are plotted , showing that the irac1-irac2 color is sufficient in distinguishing stars from agn .",
    "therefore , our infrared criteria are simply    @xmath25    we do not expect this cut to significantly affect our completeness , as the colors of our qso template stay far above this cut between @xmath26 , as do 18 of 19 sdss qsos in the swire survey .",
    "we search the first two fields for which optical / infrared photometry was available ( elais - n1 & elais - n2 ) .",
    "these fields cover 11.2 deg@xmath3 with both optical and infrared imaging , and yield 100 @xmath0-dropout candidates between @xmath27 .",
    "ten candidates were followed up with optical spectroscopy with keck / lris and palomar / cosmic , confirming that all 10 are qsos with @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , analysis of the complete optical - ir colors and four band irac colors ( when available ) confirm a reliability @xmath28% .",
    "we perform detailed monte - carlo simulations which account for variations in the qso spectral slope and emission line equivalent widths , the distribution of intervening ly@xmath9 absorbers , and imaging depth to derive the selection completeness,@xmath29 , as a function of redshift and magnitude .",
    "we find that the completeness based on color selection alone is 85 - 90% near the center of the redshift window .",
    "however , at the faintest magnitudes we are insensitive to some qsos at the high redshift end ( @xmath30 ) due to the limited depth our @xmath0-band imaging .",
    "therefore , the effective volume in the faintest bin is 72% of the volume of the brightest bin .",
    "we integrate the @xmath29 function to derive an effective volume ( and subsequent spece densities ) for each magnitude bin .",
    "the binned qlf data are plotted in figure 2 and match well with the faint end values from sdss ( richards et al .",
    "2006 , in press ) .",
    "we fit a double power - law to our data and the sdss data and constrain the bright end slope to the value measured by sdss ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "our fitted parameters are @xmath6 , @xmath32(1450)@xmath33 , and @xmath34 mag@xmath35 mpc@xmath36 using a @xmath37cdm cosmology ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "our fitted faint end slope is significantly steeper than that of h04 . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test gives a probability p=0.004% of measuring a more discrepant distribution from the same parent sample .",
    "we therefore rule out , at the 4@xmath21 level , the faint slope of h04 .",
    "we note , however , that at least part of the discrepancy may be explained by their use of only broad line ( @xmath41 km s@xmath35 ) agn .",
    "although we expect most of our objects to have broad lines , we can not rule out a significant population of narrow line objects at the faint end of our sample .",
    "the pei ( 1995 ) fit has an almost identical faint end slope , but with a different normalization that predicts a factor of @xmath42 more faint qsos than our sample .",
    "this may not be surprising since the shape of the pei ( 1995 ) qlf was determined at low redshift and normalized with bright qsos at high redshift .",
    "since the bright end slope gets shallower at high redshift , this causes the faint end of the pei ( 1995 ) qlf to be too high .",
    "we therefore see no indication of evolution of the faint end slope between @xmath43",
