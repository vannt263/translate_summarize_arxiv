    "the receiver records the function @xmath3 , given by the sum of all these convolved signals .",
    "more precisely , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is additive noise .",

    "when and under which conditions is it possible to recover all the individual signals @xmath1 and @xmath2 from just one received signal @xmath3 ?",
    "blind deconvolution ( when @xmath8 ) by itself is already a hard problem to solve .",
    "here we deal with the even more difficult situation of a mixture of blind deconvolution problems .",
    "thus we need to correctly blindly deconvolve and demix at the same time .",
    "this challenging problem appears in a variety of applications , such as audio processing  @xcite , image processing  @xcite , neuroscience  @xcite , spectroscopy  @xcite , astronomy  @xcite .",
    "it also arises in wireless communications  @xcite and is expected to play a central role in connection with the future internet - of - things  @xcite .",
    "common to almost all approaches to tackle this problem is the assumption that we have multiple received signals at our disposal , often at least as many received signals as there are transmitted signals .",
    "indeed , many of the existing methods fail if the assumption of multiple received signals is not fulfilled .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the rather difficult case , where only one received signal is given , as shown in  .",
    "of course , without further assumptions , this problem is highly underdetermined and not solvable . we will prove that under reasonable and practical conditions , it is indeed possible to recover the @xmath0 transmitted signals and the associated channels in a robust , reliable , and efficient manner from just one single received signal .",
    "our theory has important implications for applications , such as the internet - of - things , since it paves the way for an efficient multi - sensor communication strategy with minimal signaling overhead .    to provide a glimpse of the kind of results we will prove ,",
    "let us assume that each of the @xmath9 lies in a known subspace of dimension @xmath10 , i.e. , there exists matrices @xmath11 of size @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "in addition the matrices @xmath11 need to satisfy a certain `` local '' mutual incoherence condition described in detail in  . this condition can be satisfied if the @xmath11 are e.g.  gaussian random matrices .",
    "we will prove a formal and slightly more general version ( see theorem  [ thm : main ] and theorem  [ thm : noise ] ) of the following informal theorem .",

    "recovering @xmath27 and @xmath7 is only possible up to a constant , since we can always multiply each @xmath26 with @xmath28 and each @xmath2 with @xmath29 and still get the same result . hence , here and throughout the paper , recovery of the vectors @xmath26 and @xmath2 always means recovery modulo constants @xmath30 .",
    "we point out that the emphasis of this paper is on developing a theoretical and algorithmic framework for joint blind deconvolution and blind demixing .",
    "a detailed discussion of applications is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "there are several aspects , such as time synchronization , that do play a role in some applications and need further attention .",
    "we postpone such details to a forthcoming paper , in which we plan to elaborate on the proposed framework in connection with specific applications .",
    "problems of the type   or   are ubiquitous in many applied scientific disciplines and in applications , see e.g  @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a large body of works to solve different versions of these problems .",
    "most of the existing works however require the availability of multiple received signals @xmath31 . and indeed , it is not hard to imagine that for instance an svd - based approach will succeed if @xmath32 ( and must fail if @xmath33 ) .",
    "a sparsity - based approach can be found in  @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we are interested in the case where we have only one single received signal @xmath3  a single snapshot , in the jargon of array processing .",
    "hence , there is little overlap between these methods heavily relying on multiple snapshots ( manu of which do not come with any theory ) and the work presented here .",

    "there are numerous papers on blind channel estimation in connection with cdma , including the previously cited articles  @xcite .",
    "our work differs from the existing literature on this topic in several ways : as mentioned before , we do not require that we have multiple received signals , we allow all multipath channels @xmath2 to differ from each other , and do not impose a particular channel model .",
    "moreover , we provide a rigorous mathematical theory , instead of just empirical observations .",
    "the special case @xmath35 ( one unknown signal and one unknown convolving function ) reduces   to the standard blind deconvolution problem , which has been heavily studied in the literature , cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein . many of the techniques for `` ordinary '' blind deconvolution do not extend ( at least not in any obvious manner ) to the case @xmath36 .",
    "hence , there is essentially no overlap with this work ",
    "with one notable exception . the pioneering paper  @xcite has definitely inspired our work and also informed many of the proof techniques used in this paper .",
    "hence , our paper can and should be seen as an extension of the `` single - user '' ( @xmath35 ) results in  @xcite to the multi - user setting ( @xmath36 ) . however , it will not come as a big surprise to the reader familiar with  @xcite , that there is no simple way to extend the results in  @xcite to the multi - user setting unless we assume that we have multiple received signals @xmath31 . indeed , as may be obvious from the length of the proofs in our paper , there are substantial differences in the theoretical derivations between this manuscript and  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the sufficient condition for exact recovery in this paper is more complicated since @xmath0 ( @xmath37 ) users are considered and the  incoherence \" between users need to be introduced properly .",
    "moreover , the construction of approximate dual certificate is nontrivial as well ( see section  [ s : dual ] ) in the  multi - user \" scenario .",
    "the paper  @xcite considers the following generalization of  @xcite apply to  @xcite as well . ] .",
    "assume that we are given signals @xmath38 , the goal is to recover the @xmath1 and @xmath39 from @xmath40 .",
    "this setting is somewhat in the spirit of  , but it is significantly less challenging , since ( i ) it assumes the same convolution function @xmath39 for each signal @xmath1 and ( ii ) there are as many output signals @xmath41 as we have input signals @xmath1 .",
    "non - blind versions of   or   can be found for instance in  @xcite . in the very interesting paper  @xcite",
    ", the authors analyze various problems of decomposing a given observation into multiple incoherent components , which can be expressed as @xmath42 here @xmath43 are ( decomposable ) norms that encourage various types of low - complexity structure .",
    "however , as mentioned before , there is no `` blind '' component in the problems analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , while   is formally somewhat similar to the semidefinite program that we derive to solve the blind deconvolution - blind demixing problem ( see  ) , the dissimilarity of the right - hand sides in   and   makes all the differences when theoretically analyzing these two problems .",
    "the current manuscript can as well be seen as an extension of our work on self - calibration  @xcite to the multi - sensor case . in this context , we also refer to related ( single - input - single - output ) analysis in  @xcite .      in section  [ s : prelim ] we describe in detail the setup and the problem we are solving .",

    "our framework also covers certain self - calibration scenarios  @xcite involving multiple sensors .",
    "we consider the following setup @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we assume that all the matrices @xmath82 and @xmath11 are given , but none of the @xmath26 and @xmath83 are known .",
    "note that all @xmath83 and @xmath26 can be of different lengths .",
    "we point out that the total number of measurements is given by the length of @xmath3 , i.e. , by @xmath23 .",

    "this model includes the blind deconvolution - blind demixing problem   as a special case , as we will explain in section  [ s : maintheorem ] .",
    "but it also includes other cases as well .",
    "consider for instance a linear system @xmath86 , where the measurement matrices @xmath11 are not fully known due to lack of calibration  @xcite and @xmath87 represents the unknown calibration parameters associated with @xmath11 .",
    "an important special situation that arises e.g.  in array calibration  @xcite is the case where we only know the direction of the rows of @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , the norms of each of the rows of @xmath11 are unknown .",
    "if in addition each of the @xmath87 belongs to a known subspace represented by @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath88 , then we can write such an @xmath89 as @xmath90 .",

    "@xmath111 can be also written into simple matrix form , i.e. , @xmath112 , which is easily verified by definition .",
    "thus we have lifted the _ non - linear vector - valued _",

    "moreover , finding such @xmath0 rank-1 matrices satisfying   is generally an np - hard problem  @xcite .",
    "hence , to combat this underdeterminedness , we attempt to recover @xmath114 by solving the following nuclear norm minimization problem , @xmath115 if the solutions ( or the minimizers to  ) @xmath116 are all rank - one , we can easily extract @xmath83 and @xmath26 from @xmath117 via a simple matrix factorization . in case of noisy data , the @xmath117 will not be exactly rank - one , in which case we set @xmath83 and @xmath26 to be the left and right singular vector respectively , associated with the largest singular value of @xmath117 .",
    "naturally , the question arises if and when the solution to   coincides with the true solution @xmath114 .",
    "it is the main purpose of this paper to shed light on this question .",
    "analogous to matrix completion , where one needs to impose certain incoherence conditions on the singular vectors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , we introduce two quantities that describe a notion of incoherence of the matrices @xmath82 .",

    "the quantity @xmath123 will be useful to establish theorem  [ thm : noise ] , while the main purpose of introducing @xmath124 is to quantify a `` joint incoherence pattern '' on all @xmath82 .",

    "partition @xmath125 of the index set @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 such that for each pair of @xmath129 with @xmath130 and @xmath131 , we have    @xmath132    which says that each @xmath133 does not deviate too much from @xmath134 . the key question here is whether such a _ common _ partition exists .",
    "it is hard to answer it in general . to the best of our knowledge",

    "if all @xmath82 are `` low - frequency '' dft matrices , i.e. , the first @xmath143 columns of an @xmath144 dft matrix with @xmath118 , we can actually create an _",

    "a similar spirit applies to this problem as well , i.e. , both @xmath174 are required to be small .",
    "we can ensure that the second term in   is small since each @xmath94 is a gaussian random vector and randomness contributes a lot to making the quantity small ( with high probability ) .",

    "<S> this challenging problem , which intertwines blind deconvolution with blind demixing , appears in a variety of applications , such as audio processing , image processing , neuroscience , spectroscopy , and astronomy . </S>",
    "<S> it is also expected to play a central role in connection with the future internet - of - things . </S>",
    "<S> we will prove that under reasonable and practical assumptions , it is possible to solve this otherwise highly ill - posed problem and recover the @xmath0 transmitted functions @xmath1 and the impulse responses @xmath2 in a robust , reliable , and efficient manner from just one single received function @xmath3 by solving a semidefinite program . </S>",
    "<S> we derive explicit bounds on the number of measurements needed for successful recovery and prove that our method is robust in presence of noise . </S>",
    "<S> our theory is actually a bit pessimistic , since numerical experiments demonstrate that , quite remarkably , recovery is still possible if the number of measurements is close to the number of degrees of freedom .    </S>",
