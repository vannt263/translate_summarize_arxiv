    "let @xmath4 be a subvariety of the moduli space @xmath5 of complex smooth curves of genus @xmath6 of codimension @xmath7 .",

    "all the curves of genus @xmath6 contained in @xmath8 , with @xmath9 generic in @xmath4 , are birationally equivalent .",
    "this is an extension of the theorem proved by bardelli and pirola ( see @xcite ) for the whole @xmath1 and can be seen as a noether - lefschetz locus problem for surfaces which are the product of two curves of the same genus ( see corollary ( [ remark_nl ] ) ) .",
    "more precisely , our result is as follows :    [ main ] let @xmath10 a codimension @xmath7 subvariety .",
    "assume that @xmath2 ( in particular @xmath11 ) , then the jacobian of a generic curve @xmath9 of @xmath4 is not isogenous to another jacobian .",
    "the same is true for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "observe that the theorem fails for @xmath14 and @xmath12 : in this case @xmath15 is a divisor in @xmath16 , therefore intersecting in the siegel upper space @xmath17 the jacobian locus @xmath18 with the image @xmath19 by the action of a fixed isogeny @xmath20 , we get a divisor in @xmath15 where the jacobian of a generic element is isogenous to a different jacobian .    for @xmath2 ,",
    "our strategy is as follows : after a base change we have two families of smooth complex curves of genus @xmath6 on a base variety @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 and a family of isogenies of the associated family of jacobians , that is @xmath24 this means that for @xmath25 the map @xmath26 is an isogeny , here @xmath27 and @xmath28    it follows that the associated rational hodge structures are isomorphic .",
    "consider the local ( polarized ) systems @xmath29 and @xmath30 and tensoring by @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33    in particular the infinitesimal variation of hodge structure associated to the hodge filtration of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are isomorphic .",
    "we borrowed this basic observation from claire voisin ( see remark ( 4.2.5 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the infinitesimal invariant of hodge structure of curves determines the quadrics that contain a canonical curve ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this allows to translate our problem to a geometric one .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the space of quadrics that contain the canonical curve associated to @xmath38 and @xmath39 it follows that under a choice of a suitable canonical embedding @xmath40 has codimension @xmath41 , where @xmath0 is the codimension of @xmath42 in @xmath5 and @xmath43 is the modular mapping @xmath44 we can bound the codimension @xmath0 by using the clifford index . for this we prove a result that gives an interesting ( at least in our opinion ) reconstruction result of the curve from a _ partial system of quadrics_. it is a generalization of the babbage - enriques - petri theorem ( see e.g. chapter @xmath45 , section @xmath45 in @xcite ) .",
    "[ main_geom ] let @xmath9 be a curve of genus @xmath6 and clifford index @xmath46 .",

    "the corollary is a consequence of the theorem ( [ main_geom ] ) .",
    "indeed , let @xmath46 be the clifford index of a generic element of @xmath4 .",
    "the locus of curves with given clifford index can have several components and the minimal codimension is attained when @xmath46 is realized by a @xmath52 linear series , with @xmath53 .",
    "this follows easily by a parameter count from a result in @xcite where it is proved that a curve @xmath9 with clifford index @xmath46 is either @xmath54-gonal or the dimension of the brill - noether locus @xmath55 is at least @xmath56 .",
    "then , by riemann - hurwitz , the codimension of the component of the curves with a @xmath57 linear series is @xmath58 .",
    "hence , since we assume @xmath2 , we have @xmath59 therefore @xmath60 and the result follows from ( [ main_geom ] ) since @xmath2 implies @xmath49 for @xmath7 .    in section @xmath61",

    "theorem ( [ main_geom ] ) will be proved in section 3 .",
    "the idea of the proof is as follows : assuming the existence of a second non - degenerate curve in the intersection of the quadrics we select linearly independent points @xmath62 in this curve .",
    "then , by constructing a suitable rank @xmath61 vector bundle on @xmath9 , we are able to find points @xmath63 such that the linear span of the points @xmath62 is contained in the linear span of the points @xmath64 . from this",
    "it is easy to obtain a contradiction by using a theorem of ran @xcite .",
    "to prove the divisorial case of the main theorem , we use the original approach in @xcite , based on the analysis of the map @xmath65 ( in fact we will work with the dual lattices , that is , with the homology groups ) . if we can prove that @xmath66 @xmath67 we will get that @xmath68 is isomorphic to @xmath69 and @xmath70 is given by multiplication by @xmath71 we use degeneration to @xmath72 and study the monodromy action on @xmath73 the basic geometric information is now encoded on the generalized jacobians . roughly speaking one",
    "has to prove that part of the limit map @xmath74 is multiplication by @xmath71 this gives that the map @xmath70 is multiplication by @xmath75 on _ a part of _ _ the invariant cycles .",
    "_ we need finally to have degenerations with independent monodromy to complete the proof .",
    "it is clear that to follow this strategy one needs to control the degeneration type .",
    "using the theory of divisors on @xmath5 and following a valuable suggestion of gavril farkas , we realize the above program when @xmath76 the degeneration procedure is performed in sections @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 we will prove the existence of a type of degeneration ( if @xmath80 ) to the union of a curve of genus @xmath81 and two generic elliptic tails .",
    "the _ independent _ degenerations to @xmath82 are obtained by letting the elliptic tails becomes singular . to extract more information from the degeneration we analyze the type of monodromy",
    "involved that we classify in three cases ( a , b , c of section @xmath78 ) .",
    "then we analyze the geometry of the generalized jacobians by comparing their extension classes . in section @xmath83",
    "we complete the proof by comparing the invariants of the two degenerations .",
    "* acknowledgements : * we thank gavril farkas for useful and stimulating conversations on the moduli space of curves .",
    "the aim of this section is to prove that corollary ( [ main_cor ] ) implies theorem ( [ main ] ) under the hypothesis @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "remember that an isogeny @xmath84 between principally polarized abelian varieties @xmath85 and @xmath86 such that @xmath87 is determined by a subgroup @xmath88 of the group of @xmath43-torsion points @xmath89 totally isotropic with respect to the riemann bilinear form @xmath90 ( being @xmath91 ) and a level subgroup @xmath92 of the theta group @xmath93 , see ( @xcite , chapter 23 ) .",
