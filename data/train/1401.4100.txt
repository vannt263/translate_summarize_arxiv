    "recent years have witnessed many breakthroughs in the study of the topological insulators ( tis ) , a new class of materials with a bulk band gap and topologically protected boundary states @xcite . based on tis ,",
    "many intriguing phenomena , such as giant magneto - electric effects@xcite and the appearance of majorana fermions@xcite , are predicted , which would result in new device paradigms for spintronics and quantum computation .",
    "in particular , two - dimensional ( 2d ) tis have some unique advantages over three - dimensional ( 3d ) tis in some respects : all the scatterings of electrons are totally forbidden , leading to dissipationless charge or spin current carried by edge states ; and the charge carriers can be easily controlled by gating .",
    "although many materials are theoretically predicted to be 2d tis@xcite , so far only the hgte / cdte@xcite and inas / gasb@xcite quantum wells are verified by transport experiments , which , however , still face particular challenges : very small bulk gap and incompatibility with conventional semiconductor devices . therefore search and design of 2d tis with larger gaps from the commonly used materials is indispensable for their practical utilization .",
    "graphene , with many superior properties from mechanical@xcite to electronic@xcite , has made remarkable progress in numerous applications .",
    "this has triggered extensive research on other 2d materials , such as silicene , germenene , tin monolayer , bn , mos@xmath4 and many others@xcite . among them ,",
    "graphene and silicene could be well produced@xcite , however , their practical applications as 2d tis are substantially hindered by their extremely small bulk gaps ( @xmath5 mev for graphene@xcite and 1.55 mev for silicene@xcite ) .",
    "germanene and tin monolayer have larger topologically nontrivial gap@xcite but have not been fabricated experimentally yet .",
    "very recently , germanane , a one - atom - thick sheet of hydrogenated germanene with the formula geh , structurally similar to graphane , has been synthesized successfully@xcite . with the predicted high mobility and",
    "easier integrability into the current electronics industry@xcite , it is considered as a promising new star in the field of 2d nanomaterials@xcite . at the same time",
    ", the success of production of germanane has also stimulate the synthesis of its counterparts , such as halogenated germanenes .",
    "in this work , using first - principles calculations , we investigate electronic and topological properties of single layer of hydrogenated / halogenated germanene ( geh , gef , gecl , gebr and gei ) .",
    "we find gei is a 2d ti with an extraordinarily large bulk gap of about 0.3 ev , and geh , gef , gecl and gebr are trivial insulators but can be driven into nontrivial topological phases with sizable gaps larger than 0.1 ev under tensile strains .",
    "we clearly reveal the physical mechanism for such large topologically nontrivial gaps : due to the functionalization of germanene , the @xmath1 orbitals dominate the electronic states near the fermi level , instead of original @xmath2 orbitals ; and consequently the strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) within @xmath1 orbitals opens large nontrivial gaps .",
    "thereinto , the coupling of the @xmath3 orbitals of ge and heavy halogens in forming the @xmath1 orbitals plays a key role in the further enlargement of the gaps in halogenated germanenes .",
    "the @xmath6 topological order is due to the @xmath7-@xmath8 band inversion at the @xmath9 point driven by the external strain or different chemical functionalizations .",
    "our calculations are performed in the framework of density functional theory with _ ab _ _ initio _ psudopotentials and plane wave formalism as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package @xcite .",
    "the brillouin zone is integrated with a @xmath10 _ k _ mesh .",
    "the plane - wave cut - off energy is set as 400 ev .",
    "the system is modeled by a single hydrogenated or halogenated germanene layer and a vacuum region more than 10  thick to eliminate the spurious interaction between neighbouring slabs .",
    "the structures are relaxed until the remaining force acting on each atom is less than 0.01 ev /  within generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional . because gga usually underestimates the band gap of germanide severely@xcite , we then use heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) screened coulomb hybrid density functionals@xcite to calculate the electronic structures and @xmath6 topological invariant .",
    "the hse calculations yield a band gap of 1.5 ev for the bulk geh in a layered crystal structure , in good agreement with recent diffuse reflectance absorption spectroscopy measurement and theoretical calculation@xcite .     and a@xmath4 and the buckling of ge plane @xmath11 .",

    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "figure 1 shows the optimized 2d gei lattice structure , which is a fully iodinated germanene single layer .",
    "all the germanium ( ge ) atoms are in _ _ sp__@xmath12 hybridization forming a hexagonal network , and the iodine ( i ) atoms are bonded to the ge atoms on both sides of the plane in an alternating manner .",
    "the equilibrium lattice constant is 4.32  , with the buckling of the germanium plane ( @xmath11 ) , the ge - ge and ge - i bond length being 0.69  , 2.59  and 2.57  , respectively .    without the soc , gei is gapless with the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum degenerate at the fermi level ( @xmath13 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "following the method proposed by fu and kane@xcite , @xmath15 for gei is calculated from the parities of wave function at all time - reversal - invariant momenta ( @xmath18 ) , one @xmath9 and three m points , as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes parity eigenvalues and @xmath21 is the number of the occupied bands .",
    "2(c ) shows the parities of eleven occupied bands at @xmath9 and m. it readily yields @xmath17 , indicating quantum spin hall effect can be realized in the single gei layer .    for a 2d ti ,",
    "a remarkable characteristic is an odd number of dirac - like edge states connecting the conduction and valence bands .",
    "thus we have also checked existence of the edge states in gei .",
    "we use an armchair gei nanoribbons with all the edge atoms passivated by hydrogen atoms to eliminate the dangling bonds . a large ribbon width of 9.3 nm is selected to avoid the interactions between the two edges . fig .",

    "3(b ) displays the real - space charge distribution of edge states at the @xmath9 point .",
    "it is visualized that these states are located at the two edges and distributed on not only ge but also i atoms . the existence of edge states further indicates gei to be a 2d ti .",

    "( b ) real - space charge distribution of edge states at @xmath9.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the topological properties of gei is closely related to the ge - ge bond strength , which is well confirmed by the direct comparison with geh .",
    "geh shares a similar geometric structure as gei but has a smaller lattice constant ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is a normal insulator with a trivial gap of 1.60 ev ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , while tensile strain could drive it into a ti phase displaying a nontrivial gap of 0.20 ev at the @xmath9 point and an indirect bulk gap of 0.13 ev ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) . figs .",
    "4(c ) and ( d ) show the band evolution at the @xmath9 point of geh under soc and strain .",
    "our calculations show that the states near @xmath13 are mainly contributed by the @xmath7 and @xmath3 orbitals of ge atoms , and thus we reasonably neglect other atomic orbitals in the following discussion .",
    "firstly the chemical bonding of ge - ge makes the @xmath7 ( @xmath3 ) orbital split into the bonding and antibonding states , labeled with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , where the superscripts @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the parities of corresponding states . without strain",
    ", @xmath23 is lower than @xmath24 , and the trivial gap ( @xmath28 ) of the system ( i.e. , geh ) is just the distance between them ( fig .",
    "4(c ) ) . applying tensile strain , with the ge - ge bonding strength weakened , the splitting of @xmath22 and @xmath24 ( @xmath29 ) is rapidly reduced , causing @xmath24 shifting below @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "4(d ) ) . in this inverted band structure ,",
    "the @xmath24 is occupied , while the quadruply degenerate @xmath23 is half occupied if the soc is turned off , resulting in that @xmath13 stays at @xmath23 level and the system becomes a semimetal .",
    "in contrast , turning on soc , @xmath23 is split into @xmath30@xmath31 state with a total angular momentum @xmath32 and @xmath30@xmath33 state with a total angular momentum @xmath34 , thereby forming a nontrivial energy gap .",
    "it is also noted similar to this strain effects external pressure could induce band inversion and topological phase transition in some 3d systems@xcite . from geh to gei , the different functionalization introduces the variation of electron density , which effectively induces a `` quantum electronic stress''@xcite .",
    "based on this concept , gei should behave like a tensilely strained geh , having the inverted band structure with @xmath24 lower than @xmath23 , as shown in fig .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    gei , however , shows a much larger nontrivial gap at @xmath9 ( @xmath37 ) than strained geh : 0.54 ev for the former , 0.20 ev for the latter . in geh , according to a microscopic tight - binding model with similar basis and hamiltonian as ref .  , we get the splitting of @xmath1 orbital at @xmath9 under soc ( @xmath35 ) which determines the size of @xmath37 as shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) and ( d ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are hopping parameters corresponding to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bonds formed by 3@xmath8 orbitals ; @xmath42 is the soc coefficient ( h@xmath43=@xmath44)@xcite . it is noted that hydrogenation - induced corrugation has little effect on @xmath35 and thus was ignored safely here . for geh",
    "the @xmath1 orbital at the @xmath9 point consists entirely of the ge-@xmath3 orbitals , so @xmath42 could be approximately equal to ge atomic soc , @xmath45 .",
    "given that @xmath46 is small enough ( @xmath47 for geh ) , eq .",
    "( 1 ) is simplified based on the taylor expansion : @xmath48^{3}\\approx \\lambda\\approx\\xi_{\\rm ge}.\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we can see @xmath35 in geh is of the order of @xmath45 ( 0.196 ev@xcite ) , in agreement with our dft calculation ( 0.20 ev ) .",
    "importantly , eq .",
    "( 2 ) also implies that @xmath35 is almost independent of strain , thus the nontrivial gap in the ti phase is found to almost keep constant with the increase of strain .",
    "in gei , the @xmath1 orbital at the @xmath9 point is derived from the hybridization of the ge-@xmath3 and i-@xmath3 orbitals . here eq .",
    "( 1 ) still works but @xmath42 in it should be the combination of ge and i atomic soc .",
    "then the introduction of large i atomic soc ascribed to its heavy atomic mass further increases dramatically the magnitude of @xmath35 in gei .",
    "thus now we could easily understand why the nontrivial gap of gei is much larger than that of geh",
    ".    actually , eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) also work for germanene , silicene and graphene , where @xmath35 is of the order of atomic soc of ge , si or c. fig .",
    "4(e ) shows the band structure of germanene .",
    "one can see its nontrivial gap is generated by the splitting of @xmath2 orbital at k under soc ( @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 mev , though the splitting of @xmath1 orbital at @xmath9 is much larger , @xmath51 ev . by comparing fig .",
    "4(a ) with 4(e ) , it is clearly found that an important role of adsorbed atoms on germanene is to reduce the energy of @xmath2 orbital at the k point and induce the dominance of @xmath1 orbital at the @xmath9 point near the fermi level .",
    "thus we can use the larger soc within @xmath1 orbital to open a sizeable gap .    for many 2d materials like germanene , silicene , and graphene ,",
    "the states around the fermi level are generally contributed by @xmath2 orbitals . in order to obtain the tis with visible topologically nontrivial gap",
    ", a conventional method is to increase the weak soc of @xmath2 orbitals , such as applying compressive strain to increase the curvature of plane@xcite , regularly depositing heavy transition metals ( tms ) on the surface to hybridize the @xmath2 orbital with the @xmath52 orbital of tms@xcite .",
    "remarkably , our work provides a new alternative to increase the nontrivial gap , i.e. , by making the orbitals ( such as @xmath1 ) with large effective soc dominate the states around the fermi level .",
    "recent theoretical work shows that sni , iodinated tin monolayer , is also a 2d ti with a bulk gap of about 0.3 ev@xcite .",
    "however , the origin of this large gap of sni was not clearly known .",
    "similar to gei , once the sn mononlayer is iodinated , the original sn @xmath2 orbital dominance near the fermi level is changed into @xmath1 orbital dominance , and then the larger soc with @xmath1 orbital introduces larger nontrivial gap . given that sn has a much larger atomic soc than ge , it is supposed that sni would have a larger nontrivial gap than gei .",
    "however , we observe that the bulk gap of gei ( 0.3 ev ) is unexpectedly comparable with that of sni .",
    "we further find it is because the hybridization of sn-@xmath3 and i-@xmath3 in forming @xmath1 orbital is much smaller than that of ge-@xmath3 and i-@xmath3 .",
    "a simple orbital analysis indicates that the ratio of sn-@xmath3 to i-@xmath3 component in the @xmath1 orbital at the @xmath9 point is about @xmath53 while the ratio of ge-@xmath3 to i-@xmath3 is about @xmath54 .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] the lattice constant(@xmath55 ) and ge - ge bond length ( @xmath56 ) at equilibrium , critical strain ( @xmath57 ) and strained lattice constant(@xmath58 ) where the topological phase transition occurs , nontrivial gap at @xmath9 ( @xmath59 ) , indirect bulk gap ( @xmath60 ) for geh , gef , gecl , gebr and gei .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we further investigate other functionalized germanenes ( gef , gecl and gebr ) , structural analogues of gei and geh . similar to geh , all of them undergo a phase transition from normal to topological insulators under tensile strain .",
    "table 1 summarizes their lattice constants , ge - ge bond lengths , critical strains where phase transitions occur , and the nontrivial gaps in their ti phase .",
    "due to the weaker ge - ge bond strengths in gef , gecl and gebr , their critical strains are quite small , @xmath61 3% , indicating the experimental feasibility . depending on different hybridization levels of the @xmath3 orbitals of ge and different halogens in forming @xmath1 orbitals , they show different bulk gaps , however , all of which are larger than 0.1 ev , ample for practical application at room temperature . in addition , it is known that the nontrivial topologies of graphene , silicene and germanene are easily destroyed by the substrate , which breaks their _ ab _ sublattice symmetry and introduces the trivial gap at the k point .",
    "in contrast , although all the topological properties of functionalized germanenes shown in this work are obtained for free - standing sheets , their nontrivial topologies would be quite robust when they are on the substrate , because their band inversion occurs at the @xmath9 point rather than the k point and the full saturation of ge @xmath62 orbitals ensures a weak interaction with the substrate .",
    "in summary , based on first - principle calculations , we have studied the band topologies in functionalized germanene , including the recently synthesized germanene and halogenated germanenes . among them , gei is found to be a promising 2d ti with a very large gap of about 0.3 ev , while the others could be transformed into tis with sizeable gaps larger than 0.1 ev by applying tensile strain .",
    "these large gaps are originated from strong soc within the @xmath1 orbitals , which is of the order of the ge atomic soc in geh and further magnified in halogenated germanene due to the coupling between @xmath3 orbitals of ge and heavy halogens in forming @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath8 band inversion at the @xmath9 point , as the physical origin for the @xmath6 topological order , can be driven by different chemical functionalizations or the external strain .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate the potential for utilization of topological edge states of germanium films in low - power spintronics devices at room temperature .",
