    "we study the relationship between the geometry and the laplace spectrum of a closed orbifold via its heat kernel ; as in the manifold case , the time - zero asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel furnishes geometric information about the orbifold .",
    "orbifolds began appearing sporadically in the spectral theory literature in the early 1990s , and have received more concentrated attention in the last five years .",
    "c. farsi @xcite showed that the spectrum of an orbifold determines its volume by proving that weyl s asymptotic formula holds for orbifolds .",
    "dryden and a. strohmaier @xcite showed that for a compact , negatively curved two - dimensional orbifold , the laplace spectrum determines both the length spectrum and the orders of the singular points and vice versa ; on the other hand , p. doyle and j.p .",
    "rossetti @xcite gave ( disconnected ) examples of isospectral flat two - dimensional orbifolds with different length spectra and orders of singular points .",
    "further investigations of the relationship between the lengths of closed geodesics and the spectrum were carried out by e. stanhope and a. uribe in @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask about the singularities that can appear in an isospectral family of orbifolds .",
    "stanhope @xcite showed that , in general , there can be at most finitely many isotropy types ( up to isomorphism ) in a set of isospectral riemannian orbifolds that share a uniform lower bound on ricci curvature . on the other hand , n. shams , stanhope , and webb @xcite constructed arbitrarily large ( finite ) isospectral sets of orbifolds satisfying this curvature condition whose isotropy types differ .",
    "rossetti , d. schueth , and m. weilandt @xcite recently constructed a pair of isospectral riemannian orbifolds whose isotropy types have different orders .    for riemannian manifolds ,",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel can be used to relate the geometry of the manifold to its spectrum . from the so - called _ heat invariants _ appearing in the asymptotic expansion , one can tell the dimension , the volume , and various quantities involving the curvature of the manifold . the heat kernel has been studied in various analogous or more general settings ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the case of a _ good _ riemannian orbifold ( i.e. , an orbifold arising as the orbit space of a manifold under the action of a discrete group of isometries ) , h. donnelly @xcite proved the existence of the heat kernel and constructed the asymptotic expansion for the heat trace .",
    "we extend donnelly s work to the case of general compact orbifolds .",
    "moreover , in both the good case and the general case , we express the heat invariants in a form that clarifies the asymptotic contribution of each part of the singular set of the orbifold .",
    "we calculate several terms in the asymptotic expansion explicitly in the case of two - dimensional orbifolds ; we use these terms to prove that the spectrum distinguishes elements within various classes of two - dimensional orbifolds .",
    "in particular , within the class of all two - dimensional orbifolds with nonnegative euler characteristic , the spectrum is a complete topological invariant .",
    "additional results are obtained for triangular pillow orbifolds endowed with a hyperbolic structure , and for nonorientable two - dimensional orbifolds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec.oflds ] ,",
    "we give the background necessary for the rest of the paper , recalling several results that clarify the structure of the singular locus of an orbifold .",
    "section [ sec.heatkernel ] is devoted to the construction of the heat kernel on an arbitrary closed riemannian orbifold by means of the construction of a parametrix .",
    "the existence of the heat kernel for closed orbifolds was shown previously by y .-",
    "chiang @xcite ; existence also follows from more general results for the heat kernel on riemannian foliations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we give a different construction in order to express the heat kernel in a convenient form that will allow us , in section [ sec.asymptotics ] , to generalize donnelly s asymptotic expansion . section [ sec.apps ] is devoted to various applications of the heat expansion , including those mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
