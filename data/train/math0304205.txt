    "-5 mm    saturated models play an important role in model theory .",
    "in fact , when studying the model theory of a complete theory @xmath0 , one may work in a large saturated model of @xmath0 with its definable sets , and forget everything else about @xmath0 .",
    "this large saturated structure is sometimes called the `` universal domain '' , sometimes the `` monster model '' .",
    "a significant work has been done the last twenty years on the automorphism groups of saturated models .",
    "it is this work that i want to review here .",
    "there is a central question that i will use as a `` main theme '' to organize the paper : what information about @xmath1 and its theory are contained in its group of automorphisms ? in the best case , @xmath1 itself is `` encoded '' in some way in this group ; recovering @xmath1 from it is known as `` the reconstruction problem '' .",
    "a possible answer to this problem is a theorem of the form : if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are structures in a given class with isomorphic automorphism groups , then @xmath2 and @xmath3 are isomorphic .    throughout this paper , @xmath0 is supposed to be a countable complete theory .",
    "the countability of @xmath0 is by no means an essential hypothesis .",
    "its purpose is only to make the exposition smoother , and most of the results generalize without difficulty to uncountable theories .",
    "we will denote by @xmath4 the group of automorphisms of the structure @xmath1 , and if @xmath5 is a subset of @xmath1 , @xmath6 will be the pointwise stabilizer of @xmath5 : @xmath7    when we say ",
    "definable \" , we mean  definable without parameters \" .",
    "-5 mm    as a preliminary remark , let us say that the automorphism group of a saturated model is always very rich : if @xmath1 has cardinality @xmath8 , then its automorphism group has cardinality @xmath9 .",
    "i do not know who was the first to introduce the small index property . as we will see , it is crucial in the subject .",
    "let @xmath1 be a countable structure .",
    "we say that @xmath1 ( or @xmath4 ) has the small index property if for any subgroup @xmath10 of @xmath4 of index less than @xmath11 , there exists a finite set @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "remark that the converse is true : any subgroup containing a subgroup of the form @xmath6 where @xmath5 is finite , has a countable index in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the subgroups containing a subgroup of the form @xmath6 are precisely the open neighborhoods of the identity for the pointwise convergence topology . in other words ,",
    "the small index property allows us to recover the topological structure of @xmath4 from its pure group structure .",
    "the small index property has been proved for a number of countable saturated structures :    1 .",
    "the infinite set without additional structure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the linear densely ordered sets @xcite .",
    "3 .   the vector spaces over a finite field @xcite .",
    "4 .   the random graph @xcite . 5 .   various other classes of graphs @xcite .",
    "generic relational structures @xcite .",
    "@xmath14-categorical @xmath14-stable structures @xcite .",
    "the small index property has also been proved for some countable structures which are not saturated : for the free group with @xmath14-generators ( @xcite ) , for arithmetically saturated models of arithmetic ( @xcite ) .    there are examples of countable saturated structures which fail to have the small index property .",
    "the simplest may be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 of infinite countable transcendence degree : let @xmath15 be the algebraic closure of the field of rational numbers .",
    "there is an obvious homomorphism @xmath16 from @xmath4 onto @xmath17 ( the restriction map ) .",
    "now , it is well known that there is a subgroup @xmath10 of @xmath17 of countable index ( in fact of finite index ) which is not closed for the krull topology , which is nothing else that the pointwise convergence topology .",
    "then @xmath18 is not open , but of finite index in @xmath4 .    as we will see later , the small index property is particularly relevant for @xmath14-categorical structures .",
    "evans and hewitt have produced an example of such a structure without the small index property ( @xcite ) .",
    "with the pointwise convergence topology , @xmath4 is a topological polish group .",
    "so , we may use the powerful tools of descriptive set theory . in many cases ( for example for structures 1 - 6 above )",
    ", it can be shown that there is a ( necessarily unique ) conjugacy class which is generic , that is , is the countable intersection of dense open subsets .",
    "the elements of this class are called generic automorphisms , and they play an important role in the proof of the small index property .",
    "another possible nice property of these automorphism groups which is sometimes obtained as a bonus of the proof of the small index property , is the fact that its cofinality is not countable , that is , @xmath4 is not the union of a countable chain of proper subgroups .",
    "this is proved in particular for the full permutation group of a countable set ( @xcite ) , for the random graph and for @xmath14-categorical @xmath14-stable structures ( @xcite ) .",
    "i would like to mention here the work of rubin ( @xcite ) .",
    "he has shown how to reconstruct a certain number of structures from their automorphism group using a somewhat different method .",
    "his methods apply essentially to `` combinatorial structures '' such as the random graph , the universal homogeneous poset , the generic tournament ( a structure for which the small index property is not known ) , etc .",
    "-5 mm    recall that an imaginary element of @xmath1 is a class of a tuple of @xmath19 modulo a definable equivalence relation on @xmath19 . for instance , if @xmath20 is a group and @xmath10 a definable subgroup of @xmath21 , then any coset of @xmath10 in @xmath21 is an imaginary element .",
    "when we add all these imaginary elements to a saturated structure @xmath1 , we obtain the structure @xmath22 , and we can consider @xmath22 as a saturated structure ( in a larger language ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath1 and @xmath22 have canonically the same automorphism group : every automorphism of @xmath1 extends uniquely to an automorphism of @xmath22 .",
    "this shows a limitation to the reconstruction problem : if @xmath1 and @xmath23 are two structures which are such that `` @xmath22 and @xmath24 are isomorphic '' , then @xmath4 and @xmath25 are isomorphic via a bicontinuous isomorphism .",
    "the condition `` @xmath22 and @xmath24 are isomorphic '' may seem weird , but in fact , it is natural .",
    "roughly speaking , it means that @xmath1 can be interpreted in @xmath23 , and conversely ( a little more in fact , see @xcite for more details ) . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath1 and @xmath23 are bi - interpretable .",
    "consider now the case of an @xmath14-categorical structure @xmath1 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that any open subgroup of @xmath4 is the stabilizer @xmath26 of an imaginary element @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 acts by conjugation on the set of its open subgroups , and this action is ( almost ) isomorphic to the action of @xmath4 on @xmath22 ( almost because two different imaginary elements @xmath27 and @xmath28 may have the same stabilizer ) .",
    "so , from the topological group @xmath4 we can ( almost ) reconstruct its action on @xmath22 .",
    "we can do better :    _ @xcite _ assume that @xmath1 and @xmath23 are countable @xmath29-categorical structures .",
    "then the following two conditions are equivalent :    1 .   there is a bicontinuous isomorphism from @xmath4 onto @xmath30 2 .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath23 are bi - interpretable .    in fact ,",
    "these conditions are also equivalent to : there exists a continuous isomorphism from @xmath4 onto @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if one of the structure @xmath1 or @xmath23 has the small index property and @xmath4 is isomorphic to @xmath25 ( as pure groups ) , then @xmath1 and @xmath23 are bi - interpretable .",
    "now , if @xmath1 is not necessarily @xmath14-categorical ( but still saturated ) , the situation is a bit more complicated .",
    "we need to introduce new elements .",
    "an ultra - imaginary element of @xmath1 is a class modulo @xmath31 , where @xmath31 is an equivalence relation on @xmath32 ( @xmath33 which is invariant under the action of @xmath4 .",
    "an ultra - imaginary element is finitary if @xmath34 .",
    "a hyperimaginary element of @xmath1 is a class modulo @xmath31 , where @xmath31 is an equivalence relation on @xmath32 ( @xmath33 which is defined by a ( possibly infinite ) conjunction of first order formulas .",
    "an imaginary element is hyperimaginary , and a hyperimaginary element is ultra - imaginary .",
    "a hyperimaginary element is a class modulo an equivalence relation @xmath31 defined by a formula of the form @xmath35 where the @xmath36 are first - order formulas ( without parameters ) and whose free variables are among the @xmath37 for @xmath38 . an ultra - imaginary element is a class modulo an equivalence relation @xmath31 defined by a formula of the form @xmath39 where the @xmath40 are first order - formulas ( without parameters ) and whose free variables are among the @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a countable saturated structure , the stabilizer of a finitary ultra - imaginary element is clearly an open subgroup , and it is not difficult to see that if @xmath10 an open subgroup of @xmath4 , then there exists a finitary ultra - imaginary element @xmath27 such that @xmath10 is the stabilizer of @xmath27 . in the @xmath14-categorical case ,",
    "any finitary ultra - imaginary is in fact imaginary , and this explain why this case is so simple .    in some cases",
    ", for example for @xmath14-stable theories ( see @xcite ) , it is possible to characterize , among all open subgroups , those which are of the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 imaginary .",
    "something similar has been done for countable arithmetically saturated models of arithmetic in @xcite , and in @xcite , it is proved that if two such models have isomorphic automorphism groups , then they are isomorphic .",
    "-5 mm    it is now time to introduce the group of strong automorphisms .    _",
    "@xcite _ the group of strong automorphisms of @xmath1 is the group generated by the set @xmath41 and is denoted @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath42 is a normal subgroup of @xmath4 .",
    "its index is at most @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the quotient group @xmath43 depend only on @xmath0 : if @xmath1 and @xmath44 are two saturated models , @xmath45 , then there is a natural isomorphism from @xmath43 onto @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath43 will be denoted @xmath47 ( of course , @xmath48 stands for galois ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is ( isomorphic to ) the group of automorphisms of @xmath15 .",
    "in fact this interpretation is general .",
    "assume first that @xmath1 is of cardinality bigger than @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath27 be an ultra - imaginary element of @xmath1 .",
    "it can be shown that the following conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath51 ; 2 .   @xmath52 ; an equivalence relation is bounded if it has at most @xmath11 classes ( equivalently less than @xmath53 classes ) .",
    "the above conditions are also equivalent to : 3 .",
    "@xmath27 ( as a set ) is the class modulo an invariant bounded equivalence relation .    if these conditions are satisfied , we say that @xmath27 is bounded . it should be remarked that an imaginary element is bounded if and only if it is algebraic , if and only if its orbit is finite .",
    "we will denote by @xmath54 the set of bounded ultra - imaginary elements of @xmath1 .",
    "this set does not really depend on @xmath1 ( as soon as its cardinality is big enough ) but only on its theory : any invariant bounded equivalence relation has a representative in any uncountable saturated model .",
    "we will allow ourself to write @xmath55 when convenient .",
    "moreover @xmath42 is exactly the pointwise stabilizer of @xmath54 so that @xmath50 can be identified with the group of elementary permutations of @xmath55 . with some care",
    ", we can generalize this interpretation to models of small cardinality : for example , assume @xmath1 countable , and let @xmath44 be a large saturated extension of @xmath1 .",
    "then any automorphism @xmath56 of @xmath1 extends to an automorphism of @xmath44 , and if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are two such extensions , then their action on @xmath59 are equal ; @xmath42 is exactly the set of automorphisms whose extensions to @xmath44 act trivially on @xmath59 .    in any case , @xmath4 leaves fixed the set of bounded imaginary elements and the set of bounded hyperimaginary elements . in some cases ( for example for algebraically closed fields ) , @xmath50 acts faithfully on the set of bounded imaginary elements .",
    "it is the case if @xmath0 is stable ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is not known if it is always true for simple theories , but it is true for the so - called low simple theories ( @xcite ) and in particular for supersimple theories . for simple theories , @xmath50 acts faithfully on the set of bounded hyperimaginary elements ( @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "there is an example of a theory where the action of @xmath47 on the set of hyperimaginary elements is not faithful .",
    "there is a natural topology on @xmath50 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it can be defined in two different ways .",
    "my favorite one is via the ultraproduct construction .",
    "let @xmath60 be a family of elements of @xmath50 and @xmath61 an ultrafilter on @xmath62 .",
    "choose a saturated model @xmath1 and , for each @xmath63 an automorphism @xmath64 lifting @xmath65 .",
    "consider the ultrapower @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "we can define the automorphism @xmath68 on @xmath44 .",
    "this automorphism acts on @xmath69 , so defines an element of @xmath50 , say @xmath28 .",
    "this element @xmath28 should be considered as a limit of the family @xmath70 along @xmath61 .",
    "a subset @xmath71 of @xmath50 is closed for the topology we are defining if it is closed for this limit operation .",
    "you should be aware that the element @xmath28 may depend on the choices of the @xmath72 s , because the topology we are defining is not hausdorff in general .",
    "the other way to define a topological structure on @xmath50 is to define a topology on @xmath55 .",
    "if , as it is the case when @xmath0 is stable , @xmath50 can be identified with a group of permutation on the set of imaginary elements , then we just endow @xmath50 with the pointwise convergence topology ( that is we consider the set of imaginary elements with the discrete topology ) .",
    "otherwise , it is more complicated , and here is what should be done in general :    for each @xmath73 and @xmath31 invariant bounded equivalence relation on @xmath32 , consider the canonical mapping @xmath74 from @xmath32 onto @xmath75 . by definition",
    ", a subset @xmath71 of @xmath75 is closed if and only if @xmath76 is the intersection of a family of subsets definable with parameters .",
    "@xmath50 acts on @xmath75 and the topology on @xmath50 is defined as the coarsest topology which makes all these actions ( with various @xmath77 and @xmath31 ) continuous .",
    "now , we can prove :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath50 is a topological compact group .    1",
    ".   it is hausdorff if and only if it acts faithfully on the set of bounded hyperimaginary elements , if and only if it acts faithfully on the set of finitary bounded hyperimaginary elements . 2 .",
    "it is profinite if and only if it acts faithfully on the set of bounded imaginary elements .",
    "there is a galois correspondence between the subgroups of @xmath50 and the bounded ultra - imaginary elements : every subgroup of @xmath50 is the stabilizer of an ultra - imaginary element .",
    "the hyperimaginary elements correspond to the closed subgroups and the imaginary elements correspond to the clopen subgroups of @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the topological closure of the identity .",
    "then @xmath78 is a normal subgroup of @xmath50 . if we consider @xmath50 as a permutation group on @xmath55",
    ", @xmath78 is exactly the pointwise stabilizer of the set of bounded hyperimaginary elements .",
    "so , if we set @xmath79 , @xmath80 acts faithfully on the set of bounded hyperimaginary elements . as a quotient group , @xmath80",
    "is canonically endowed with a topology .",
    "this way , we get a compact hausdorff group .",
    "recently , l.  newelski ( @xcite ) has proved that @xmath78 is either trivial or of cardinality @xmath11 .",
    "i would like to conclude this section by a conjecture .",
    "in all the known examples of countable saturated structures where the small index property is false , there is a non open subgroup of @xmath50 of countable index ( and , its preimage by the canonical homomorphism from @xmath4 onto @xmath50 is a non open subgroup of @xmath4 of countable index ) .",
    "if @xmath5 has a cardinality strictly less than @xmath53 , define @xmath81 as the subgroup of @xmath6 generated by @xmath82 the following conjecture is open , even in the @xmath14-categorical case :    [ conjecture]assume that @xmath1 is a countable saturated structure and let @xmath10 be a subgroup of @xmath42 of index strictly less than @xmath11 . then , there exists a finite subset @xmath12 such that @xmath83 .    in @xcite",
    ", this conjecture is proved for almost strongly minimal sets ( so , in particular for algebraically closed fields ) .",
    "-5 mm    we are now given a saturated structure @xmath1 of cardinality @xmath84 .",
    "the small index property has a natural generalization . if we assume that @xmath85 ( i.e. there is exactly @xmath8 subsets of @xmath1 of cardinality less than @xmath8 ) then any subgroup of @xmath4 containing a subgroup of the form @xmath6 with @xmath86 has index at most @xmath8 .",
    "the converse is true :    _ @xcite _ assume that @xmath1 is a saturated structure of uncountable cardinality @xmath87 , and let @xmath10 be a subgroup of @xmath4 of cardinality at most @xmath8 .",
    "then , there exists a subset @xmath5 of @xmath1 of cardinality less than @xmath8 such that @xmath88 .    here",
    "again , we may introduce a topological structure on @xmath4 : if @xmath89 is an infinite cardinal , let @xmath90 be the group topology on @xmath4 for which a basis of open neighborhoods of the identity is @xmath91 to complete this definition , let @xmath92 be the group topology on @xmath4 for which a basis of open neighborhoods of the unit is @xmath93    the above theorem just says that the subgroups of @xmath4 of index at most @xmath8 are exactly the open subgroups for @xmath94 , and consequently , the topology @xmath94 can be reconstructed from the pure group structure .",
    "it is also clear that the open subsets for @xmath95 are just the intersections of less than @xmath8 @xmath96-open subsets .",
