    "the casimir effect @xcite is the most important example of a slew of phenomena usually referred to as _ fluctuation - induced interactions _ , their phenomenology extending from cosmology on the one side to nanoscience on the other @xcite .",
    "the general idea tying these diverse phenomena together is that the confining surfaces constrain the quantum and thermal field fluctuations , inducing long - range interactions between these boundaries @xcite . for electromagnetic fields ,",
    "these confinement effects lead to the casimir - van der waals interactions that can be derived within the specific framework of qed , and quantum field theory more generally @xcite . inspired by the close analogy between thermal fluctuations in fluids and quantum fluctuations in electromagnetism , fisher and degennes predicted the existence of long - range fluctuation forces in other types of critical condensed matter systems @xcite and the terms `` casimir '' or `` casimir - like effect '' now denote a range of other non - electromagnetic fluctuation - induced forces @xcite .    beyond detailed measurements of the casimir - van der waals interactions @xcite , attention has been directed towards casimir - like forces engendered by density fluctuations in the vicinity of the vapor - liquid critical point @xcite ; in binary liquid mixtures near the critical demixing point @xcite ; and in thin polymer @xcite and liquid crystalline films @xcite .",
    "most recently , several studies have examined fluctuation - induced interactions for the casimir - lifshitz force out of thermal equilibrium @xcite , for the temporal relaxation of the thermal casimir or van der waals force @xcite , and for nonequilibrium steady states in fluids @xcite , where fluctuations are anomalously large and long - range .",
    "it is instructive to recall that the original 1955 derivation of the electromagnetic casimir - van der waals interactions by lifshitz @xcite was not fundamentally rooted in qed but rather in stochastic electrodynamics , first formulated by rytov @xcite . in stochastic electrodynamics , maxwell",
    "s equations are augmented by fluctuating displacement current sources @xcite .",
    "this leads to two coupled electrodynamic langevin - type equations , for each of the fundamental electrodynamic fields , that are then solved with standard boundary conditions .",
    "the interaction force is obtained by averaging the maxwell stress tensor and taking into account the statistical properties of the fluctuating sources @xcite .",
    "this paradigmatic lifshitz - route to fluctuation - induced interactions later became disfavored as other formal approaches gained strength @xcite , but appears to be reborn in recent endeavors regarding non - equilibrium fluctuation - induced interactions @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the dean - gopinathan method there exists a mapping of the non - equilibrium problem characterized by dissipative dynamics onto a corresponding static ( lifshitz ) partition function provided by the laplace transform of the time - dependent force and the static partition function @xcite .",
    "based on the success of stochastic electrodynamics , landau and lifshitz proposed by analogy the stochastic dissipative hydrodynamic equations @xcite , augmenting the linearized navier - stokes equations with fluctuating heat flow vector and fluctuating stress tensor @xcite .",
    "this leads to three coupled hydrodynamic equations involving the fundamental hydrodynamic fields of mass density , velocity and local temperature , which can now be solved in different contexts . with the assumption of fixed temperature",
    ", this system further reduces to a langevin - type equation for the velocity field , involving the stress tensor fluctuations , and a continuity equation for the mass density field .",
    "since the fundamental hydrodynamic equations are non - linear , the derivation of fluctuating landau - lifshitz hydrodynamics already involves heavy linearity _ ans \" atze _ and the possible generalization to a full non - linear fluctuating hydrodynamics is not clear @xcite .",
    "although fluctuating electrodynamics is based on _ linear _ maxwell s equations with stresses _ quadratic _ in the field and fluctuating hydrodynamics stems from _ non - linear _ navier - stokes equations with stresses _ linear _ in velocities , the general similarity between these approaches might nevertheless lead one to assume that , in confined geometries , there should exist casimir - like hydrodynamic fluctuation forces . but",
    "this notion is at odds with the standard decomposition of the classical partition function into momentum and configurational parts .",
    "this decomposition has far - reaching consequences , which were clearly understood as far back as van der waals thesis @xcite . while there is an analogy between the description of fluctuations in these two areas of physics , caution",
    "should be exercised when trying to translate results from one field directly into the other .",
    "we will show that there does exist a type of casimir effect in the hydrodynamic context , but that this effect has fundamentally different properties from the conventional casimir effect .",
    "the first step in bringing together the casimir force in electrodynamics and its putative counterpart in hydrodynamics was made by jones @xcite .",
    "inspired by the obvious analogy between electrodynamics and hydrodynamics , jones investigated the possible existence of a long - ranged , fluctuation - induced , effective force generated by confining boundaries in a fluid .",
    "he showed that in linearized hydrodynamics the net ( mean ) stochastic force vanishes , which led him to introduce a next - to - leading order formalism .",
    "the status of this formalism , however , is not entirely clear , because there are linearity assumptions rooted deep within fluctuational hydrodynamics @xcite . within the context of this next - to - leading order formalism",
    ", jones demonstrated that long - range forces could exist in a semi - infinite fluid or around an immersed spherical body , and would be strongest in incompressible fluids , with much weaker forces in compressible fluids .",
    "this result is at odds with the momentum decomposition of the classical partition function and should be considered an artifact of the next - to - leading order analysis of the stochastic equations governing the hydrodynamic field evolution .",
    "chan and white @xcite , therefore , reconsidered the whole calculation .",
    "they concentrated on the planar geometry of two hard walls immersed in a fluid and argued that hydrodynamic fluctuations could give rise to a repulsive force in _",
    "fluids , but that this force would vanish for classical _ compressible _ fluids . since an incompressibility _ ansatz _ does not translate directly into the interaction potential in the classical partition function @xcite , this fictional case could lead to a fluctuation - induced interaction that would not be contrary to the argument based on the momentum decomposition of the classical partition function . the repulsive fluctuation - induced force would also in itself not be that hard to envision since the existence of a repulsive force in the context of van der waals interactions is well - established and was originally proposed in ref .",
    "the vanishing of the fluctuation - induced force for classical compressible fluids is based on a rough argument of analytic continuation of the viscosities into the infinite frequency domain @xcite . while this latter argument is appropriate in electrodynamics , because an infinite frequency corresponds to the vacuum , it is not reasonable in hydrodynamics , where the whole basis of the continuum hydrodynamic theory breaks down before any such limit could be enforced @xcite .",
    "therefore , both approaches to the problem of hydrodynamic casimir - like interactions have strong limitations and subsequent developments failed to conclusively prove either point of view @xcite .    in this paper , we revisit the question of the existence of long - range , fluctuation - induced forces in fluids .",
    "we work strictly within the framework of linearized stochastic hydrodynamics and rather than considering the net force , which is zero trivially , we study the force correlators . in other words",
    ", we focus on the question : in what way do boundary conditions and statistical properties of the fluctuating hydrodynamic stresses affect the statistical properties ( correlators ) of the random forces acting on the bounding surfaces ?    we formulate a general approach to this problem by considering a fluid of arbitrary compressibility and fixed homogeneous temperature , bounded between two plane - parallel , hard walls with no - slip boundary conditions .",
    "thermal fluctuations lead to spatio - temporal variations in the pressure and velocity fields that can be calculated using the linearized , stochastic navier - stokes formalism of landau and lifshitz @xcite . within this approach ,",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the time - dependent correlators ( for both the same - plate and the cross - plate correlators ) of the fluctuation - induced forces acting on the walls .",
    "in particular , we express the variance of these forces in terms of frequency integrals that have simple plate - separation dependence in the small and large plate - separation limits .",
    "our results do not depend upon the next - to - leading order formalism of jones @xcite , nor do they depend on the unrealistic validity of analytic continuation of the viscosities in the whole frequency domain @xcite .",
    "we show that , while the mean force vanishes , the variance of the fluctuation - induced normal force is finite and independent of the separation between the bounding surfaces for large separations .",
    "we call this the _ secondary casimir effect _ , because the primary casimir effect refers to the average value of the fluctuation - induced force ( which is zero here ) and not strictly its variance .",
    "both quantities have been investigated in other casimir - like situations @xcite and in disordered charged systems @xcite .",
    "the equal - time , cross - plate force correlation exhibits long - range behavior that is independent of the fluid viscosity and decays proportional to the inverse plate separation .",
    "finally , we find that the time - dependent correlators exhibit damped oscillatory behavior for small plate separations that becomes irregular at large distances .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , we outline the stochastic formalism of landau and lifshitz and the strategy of our calculation of hydrodynamic fluctuation - induced forces in the general case of compressible fluids . sections [ sec : meanforce ] and [ sec : forcevar_t ] present the main steps of our calculation .",
    "we show results for the equal - time force correlators and the two - point , time - dependent correlators in sections [ sec : numerics ] and [ sec : tnumerics ] , respectively .",
    "we conclude our discussions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the hydrodynamic fluctuations in a newtonian fluid at rest and in the absence of heat transfer .",
    "these fluctuations are described by the stochastic landau - lifshitz equations @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the velocity , pressure and density fields and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients , respectively @xcite .",
    "the randomly fluctuating microscopic degrees of freedom are driven by the random stress tensor @xmath6 , which is assumed to have a gaussian distribution with zero mean @xmath7 and the two - point correlator @xmath8 ,   \\label{eq : gaussprop2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subindices ( @xmath9 ) denote the cartesian components @xmath10 , @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath12 denote an equilibrium ensemble average at temperature @xmath13 .",
    "we do not consider any possible relaxation effects , which would formally correspond to frequency - dependent viscosities , but these effects can be easily incorporated @xcite . denoting the frequency fourier",
    "transform by a tilde , i.e. , @xmath14 we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 ,   \\label{eq : gausswprop2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which hold independent of the boundary conditions imposed on the fluid system .    before proceeding further , we should note that this form of fluctuating hydrodynamics is analogous to the rytov fluctuating electrodynamics @xcite , where the basic equations for the electric and magnetic fields are @xmath17 supplemented by @xmath18 and @xmath19 and appropriate boundary conditions . in this case , the fluctuating random polarization , @xmath20 , has gaussian properties with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 where we have assumed a dispersive dielectric response function @xmath23 .",
    "we can immediately see the similarity between eqs .  - and eqs .  - .",
    "thus , the stochastic approach to hydrodynamics is very close to lifshitz s original analysis of the electromagnetic problem @xcite , provided one fully takes into account the basic differences between the maxwell equations and the navier - stokes equations @xcite : the former are linear in the fields with stresses quadratic in the fields , while the latter are non - linear in the fields with stresses linear in the fields .",
    "this difference leads to some important distinctions and precludes directly applying results from electrodynamics to the hydrodynamic domain .      for vanishing random stress tensor , the equilibrium solution of eqs .   and is @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , corresponding to a fluid at rest at constant temperature , @xmath13 , with uniform pressure , @xmath27 , and density , @xmath28 .",
    "the random stress tensor , @xmath29 , is of order @xmath30 and , consequently , macroscopically small .",
    "therefore , the corresponding fluctuations in the velocity , pressure and density fields are also macroscopically small . therefore we introduce a linearized treatment of the landau - lifshitz equations , by setting @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the superscript @xmath34 denotes a term of order @xmath29 .",
    "we assume local equilibrium , which enables us to relate the density and pressure as @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the adiabatic speed of sound , so that @xmath37 equals the inverse adiabatic compressibility ( newton - laplace equation ) .",
    "eqs .   and",
    "can be linearized as @xmath38 or , in the frequency domain and using eq .",
    "@xcite , @xmath39    we now introduce transverse and longitudinal components of the velocity fluctuations @xmath40 , which we denote @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we have dropped the superscript @xmath34 for notational simplicity , i.e. , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the random force density vector @xmath45 can be decomposed into transverse and longitudinal components as well , using @xmath46 , where @xmath47 these random force density vector components have zero mean and zero cross correlations .",
    "their self - correlations follow from eq .   as @xmath48 the stochastic landau - lifshitz equations",

    "in fact , eq .   is a scalar equation for the longitudinal component of the velocity fluctuation @xcite .",
    "the density field fluctuations can be obtained from the longitudinal component of the velocity field fluctuations , @xmath52",

    "the correlators of the velocity and density fluctuations are given by @xmath70 the correlation function of the transverse and longitudinal components of the velocity vanishes by construction .",
    "furthermore , the transverse velocity and density fluctuations are independent fields , with vanishing correlation function . therefore , the only other correlation function we need is the density - velocity cross correlator , @xmath71    not all of these correlators contribute to the time - dependent correlator of the forces between the two hard boundaries . in appendices [ app : vtzero ] and [ app :",
    "pvzero ] , we show that the contributions to the normal force correlator generated by the correlation function of the transverse velocity field and also by the correlation function between the velocity and density fields vanish for our geometry . therefore ,",
