    "understanding and controlling transport in condensed matter systems is a topic not only of fundamental scientific interest , but also with immediate technological implications .",
    "for example , energy transport is one of the key factors determining the efficiency of light harvesting systems , organic photovoltaics , conducting polymers , and j - aggregate thin films  .",
    "energy diffusion has also been shown to play a central role in the rate of vibrational relaxation in small molecules and dna  @xcite . despite this seeming diversity ,",
    "the underlying physical description of these systems is surprisingly similar . in each case",
    ", the transport occurs across a disordered energy landscape that is modulated by thermal fluctuations from the surrounding environment .",
    "the relative importance of the strength of the disorder and the thermal fluctuations to the electronic coupling may however vary greatly from system to system .",
    "for example , energy transport in j - aggregates are generally characterized by relatively weak disorder and exciton - phonon coupling , while in natural light harvesting systems all of the relevant energy scales are of comparable magnitude  @xcite .",
    "this subtle difference in the parameter regimes leads to markedly different physical behavior in these two systems .",
    "in general the transport properties are relatively well - understood in the presence of either noise or disorder , but less is known when both are present simultaneously . for example , in the case of static , one- or two - dimensional systems , anderson localization occurs for any finite amount of disorder leading to a complete lack of transport in the long - time limit  @xcite . in the alternative setting of a system subjected to noise but not disorder , the transport is also at least qualitatively understood . in particular ,",
    "the haken - strobl - reineker ( hsr ) model , which describes a quantum system coupled to a high temperature markovian bath , is exactly solvable  @xcite .",
    "the transport qualitatively behaves like that of a classical brownian process , with an initial period of ballistic expansion before transitioning to diffusive transport at long times .",
    "the situation is more complicated when a disordered system is coupled to an environment .",
    "thermal excitation from low - lying localized states into more extended higher energy states can be sufficient to overcome the anderson localization and allow for transport to occur at long times  @xcite .",
    "in particular , mott s theory of variable range hopping has been quite successful in describing the behavior of the low temperature conductivity of disordered systems  @xcite .",
    "more recently , logan and wolynes have analyzed the role of dephasing in topologically disordered systems and provided approximate scaling relations for the transport  @xcite .",
    "their analysis and preliminary numerical results suggest that the diffusion coefficient should display a non - monotonic dependence on the system - bath coupling strength  @xcite .",
    "however , a general description of the transport valid for all temperatures is still lacking .",
    "alternatively , it has also been shown that an external driving force containing a few independent frequency components is equally sufficient to restore diffusive motion in the long time limit to an otherwise localized system  @xcite . in summary , while any finite amount of disorder leads to a lack of diffusion in one or two - dimensional systems , adding a source of dephasing can be sufficient to allow for transport to occur by destroying the phase coherence responsible for anderson localization .    here , we carry out numerically exact calculations of infinite one - dimensional disordered systems over the entire regime of dephasing within the hsr model . in section  [ sec : limits ] quantum master equations are derived for the time evolution of the density matrix in the limiting regimes of weak and strong dephasing these results allow for analytical estimates of the diffusion constant and provide an intuitive physical description of the underlying dynamics . for large dephasing , it is well known that any coherences created during the evolution are quickly destroyed and the diffusion proceeds by way of classical hopping between sites  @xcite . in the opposite regime of weak dephasing ,",
    "the exact eigenstates of the system are accurately approximated by those of the disordered system hamiltonian , and coherent quantum transport proceeds via hopping through the eigenstates .",
    "this is the regime of phonon - assisted hopping discussed in the early studies of the conductivity of disordered solids  @xcite .",
    "these analytical arguments coupled with the exact numerical calculations lead to several interesting features in the exciton dynamics :    * the strong and weak dephasing master equations allow one to extract the respective scaling behavior of the transport properties which suggests the existence of a maximum in the diffusion coefficient as a function of the dephasing rate .",
    "this prediction is confirmed numerically in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "it should be mentioned that similar scaling studies have been carried out in the context of noise - assisted transport in excitonic systems  @xcite . there",
    ", however , the focus is mostly on the optimal energy transfer time in finite systems , and the results are largely consistent with a purely classical analysis  @xcite . in the preset case",
    "there is a genuine and unambiguous quantum aspect to the transport .",
    "* in the weak dephasing regime , it is demonstrated that the diffusion constant is proportional to the anderson localization length of the disordered system hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that for systems weakly coupled to the environment , the coherent nature of the transport leads to a diffusion constant that is enhanced by a factor of the localization length as compared to the classical prediction .",
    "* the third primary result of this work is related to the initial , non - diffusive nature of the transport . over a timescale on the order of the inverse dephasing rate",
    "the dynamics are ballistic until the anderson localization length of the system is reached  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding population probability distribution during this period is exponential reflecting the exponential localization of all wavefunctions . at longer times",
    ", the influence of the dephasing becomes more important leading to diffusive motion with a characteristic gaussian probability distribution .",
    "as a result , the mean - squared displacement can be described as a combination of the short - time ballistic transport in the localized system and the long - time diffusive transport . *",
    "finally we present results on the influence of disorder and dephasing on the absorption spectra . for many materials , such as photovoltaics ,",
    "the organic semiconductor must possess not only favorable energy transport characteristics , but also a broad absorption spectrum in order to capture as much solar energy as possible .",
    "it is demonstrated that while reducing the disorder leads to enhanced transport , it also leads to a narrower absorption line shape which is not optimal in this case .",
    "therefore , we present a detailed study of the effects of dephasing and disorder on the absorption lineshape .    the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : applications ] where the practical implications of these findings are discussed . for systems such as conducting polymers where the transport properties are the key factor governing the device performance ,",
    "then one should primarily seek to reduce the amount of static disorder present in the sample .",
    "recent experimental results on the conductivity of conducting polymers and light harvesting systems are discussed in this context .",
    "the hsr model describes quantum transport in the presence of a classical markovian environment  @xcite . at equilibrium",
    "all sites are equally populated , and as such , the results presented here are strictly valid only in the high temperature limit . nevertheless , the model is capable of capturing many of the essential physical features of real systems .    in the wavefunction description of the hsr model , the thermal environment",
    "is modeled as a white noise term that modulates the site energies of the system hamiltonian which is described by the stochastic schrdinger equation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 characterizes the system - bath coupling in the local basis , and the sum extends over all @xmath2 sites of the system .",
    "the time - dependent factors , @xmath3 , are zero - mean gaussian stochastic ( wiener ) processes with @xmath4 , and the autocorrelation , @xmath5 . in this context",
    ", the dephasing rate , @xmath6 , determines the magnitude of the fluctuations . in order to recover the exact time evolution , the wavefunctions must be ensemble averaged over realizations of the noise .",
    "alternatively , due to the simple noise characteristics of the bath the averaging over the environmental fluctuations may be performed analytically .",
    "this procedure leads to an equivalent deterministic equation of motion for the density matrix , @xmath7      - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\sum_n \\left[v_n , \\left[v_n , \\rho\\right]\\,\\right ]     % + l_{\\rm d}\\rho     \\;. \\label{eq : hakenstrobl}\\ ] ] from a numerical standpoint , the density matrix approach is more efficient for small systems , while the stochastic implementation becomes essential for larger systems .",
    "the bare system is characterized by a one - dimensional tight - binding , anderson hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the electronic coupling strength .",
    "static disorder is introduced into the system hamiltonian by taking the site energies , @xmath10 , as independent , identically - distributed gaussian random variables characterized by the variance , @xmath11 . throughout ,",
    "the averages over the static disorder are denoted by the overline while the quantities denoted by angle brackets characterize the quantum - mechanical average over the environment .",
    "the hsr model for the disordered system is completely characterized by only three parameters : the electronic coupling between sites , @xmath9 , the variance of the static disorder , @xmath12 , and the dephasing rate , @xmath6 .",
    "the electronic coupling @xmath9 is used to set the energy scale throughout , which leaves only two independent dimensionless quantities , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in our simulations",
    ", the hsr is always seen to lead to diffusion at long times and we extract the diffusion constant , @xmath15 , from the limiting behavior of the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) , @xmath16 the mean - squared displacement is calculated from , @xmath17 with the origin conveniently chosen such that the first moment is zero .",
    "it is not immediately obvious that the transport should always be diffusive , particularly in the weak dephasing regime where the effects of both anderson localization and quantum coherence are prevalent . in the classical limit and in the disorder - free case",
    ", it can be shown analytically that the transport is always diffusive in the long time limit .",
    "but outside of these two regimes there is no known proof ( at least to our knowledge ) that the msd is guaranteed to increase linearly with time in the steady state .",
    "however , all of our numerical simulations as well as those of similar earlier analytical and numerical results suggest that the transport is indeed diffusive  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the transport properties , we also compute the linear absorption spectrum from the dipole autocorrelation function  @xcite , @xmath18 where the dipole moment operator is given by , @xmath19 .",
    "since all of the molecules in the system are assumed identical , we take the magnitude of the individual dipole moments equal to the constant value @xmath20 . in the numerical simulations presented below the dynamics",
    "were performed in one - dimensional chains of up to @xmath21 sites and averaged over @xmath21 to @xmath22 independent realizations of the static disorder .",
    "the transient short - time effects of the transport properties decay on the order of @xmath23 so that the dynamics are required for at least an order of magnitude longer in order to obtain a reliable estimate of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "when the disorder is absent ( @xmath24 ) , the hsr model is analytically solvable . in this case",
    "the msd is given by  @xcite , @xmath25      \\ ; , \\label{eq : msd}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to that of a brownian particle .",
    "for a time of the order of @xmath26 , the transport displays free - particle , ballistic behavior ( @xmath27 ) which transitions to diffusive motion at long times with the diffusion coefficient , @xmath28 it is clearly seen that   diverges at small dephasing . however , if @xmath29 exactly , then any amount of disorder will lead to anderson localization and no diffusion . in this interesting regime of vanishing dephasing but",
    "finite disorder the dynamics are highly coherent and display a sensitive dependence on the model parameters .",
    "this region will be explored in depth in the numerical simulations presented in section  [ sec : results ] .      in the presence of both dephasing and disorder ,",
    "analytic expressions for the msd valid for the entire parameter regime are no longer available . however ,",
    "if the dephasing rate is sufficiently large such that @xmath30 then any coherences created during the course of the time evolution are quickly destroyed . in this case ,   reduces to a model of classical hopping between neighboring sites  @xcite .",
    "as has been shown previously , averaging the hopping rates over the disorder distribution leads to the diffusion coefficient  @xcite , @xmath31 notice that   displays a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath6 , and in particular , optimal transport when @xmath32 . for large dephasing ,",
    "is recovered , and reduces to @xmath33 at small dephasing .",
    "the linear increase in the diffusion constant for @xmath34 has been previously discussed in the context of noise - assisted transport  @xcite .",
    "however ,   is applicable only when the classical hopping description is appropriate . in the weak dephasing regime",
    "the dynamics are highly coherent so the prefactor predicted by the classical hopping description of the dynamics can not be correct .",
    "as the dephasing decreases , the exact eigenstates of the total system rotate from the local basis into the exciton basis , and the wavefunctions will delocalize over coherent domains .",
    "the size of these domains is on the order of the anderson localization length , which , in turn , is governed by the disorder strength  @xcite .",
    "the short - time dynamics of an initial localized excitation in the chain will be characterized by a rapid expansion filling one of these localized domains . over a longer timescale ( of the order of @xmath23 ) the dephasing will allow for the collective hopping of the delocalized states among the various localization segments .",
    "these qualitative arguments are formalized in the following subsection through the development of a weak - coupling master equation .      in the weak dephasing regime",
    ", an accurate description of the exciton dynamics may be obtained from the redfield equation . since the system is disordered and the diffusion constant depends only on the long - time dynamics ,",
    "the secular and markov approximations can be employed without a significant loss of accuracy . in this case , the exciton populations are governed by the master equation , @xmath35 where the rates , @xmath36 the greek labels here denote eigenstates of the static disordered system hamiltonian ( exciton states ) .",
    "the equivalence of the forward and backward rates is a consequence of the high temperature nature of the thermal environment . in the secular approximation ,",
    "the coherences are decoupled from the populations and their time evolution can be determined analytically as , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the difference in eigenenergies between states @xmath39 and @xmath40 . equation   is a markovian master equation that describes hopping through the eigenstates of the disordered system .",
    "the rates and hence the diffusion constant increase linearly with @xmath6 as with the weak dephasing limit of the classical hopping result in  .",
    "however , here there is an important difference in that the redfield rates are now correctly weighted by the eigenstate overlaps .",
    "the classical hopping rates capture the correct dephasing dependence of the diffusion constant , but incorrectly describe the disorder dependence of the prefactor .",
    "as will be shown below , this difference is substantial in many physically relevant situations .",
    "the eigenstate overlaps in the redfield rates are determined solely by the disordered system hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , they depend only on the ratio of @xmath14 . in order to understand this disorder dependence consider , for example , the rate element @xmath41 . due to the static disorder ,",
    "the eigenstate @xmath40 will be localized at a position @xmath42 in the chain with a spatial extent , @xmath43 , and similarly for state @xmath39 . on average ,",
    "the spatial extent of @xmath39 and @xmath40 is determined by the anderson localization length , @xmath44 . as a result ,",
    "the rate @xmath41 can be appreciable only if the states @xmath39 and @xmath40 are located at position in the chain within an anderson localization length of one another .",
    "that is , @xmath45 .",
    "one sees that the fundamental length scale governing the magnitude of the rates in the redfield description is given by the spatial extent of the wavefunctions , i.e. , the anderson localization length .",
    "hence , on scaling grounds we expect the diffusion constant to have the following form , @xmath46 where the factor , @xmath44 , is directly proportional to the anderson localization length .",
    "as in the large dephasing limit , the diffusion in the weak dephasing regime may also be interpreted as a hopping process except that here the fundamental step size is determined by the localization length .",
    "the mean - field theory results of logan and wolynes have also arrived at a similar conclusion  @xcite .",
    "their approach indicates that the localization length appearing in   is , in fact , simply the inverse participation ratio .",
    "this result is consistent with our numerical results presented below , although our preliminary calculations in two - dimensional systems indicate that this result is only correct up to a scaling constant .      due to the intense interest in the problem of anderson localization ,",
    "accurate scaling relations are known for the localization length in disordered systems  @xcite . in one dimension systems ,",
    "the localization length is directly proportional to the mean - free path , @xmath47 . in two dimensions",
    "the localization length is exponentially larger than it is in one dimension , and metallic transport appears at a critical value of the disorder strength in three - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "transport in these systems will be discussing in a future work , but is beyond the scope of the present paper . in order to fix the proportionality",
    ", we will use the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) as a proxy for the localization length in the disordered chain , as suggested by logan and wolynes .",
    "the ipr is defined for a particular eigenstate , @xmath39 , as @xmath48 figure  [ fig : ipr ] presents the scaling of the ipr as a function of the disorder computed by direct diagonalization of the disordered system hamiltonian . due to the high temperature approximation inherent to the hsr model ,",
    "all of the eigenstates are equally capable of contributing to the transport .",
    "therefore the ipr presented in figure  [ fig : ipr ] , @xmath49 , is averaged over all eigenstates , which reproduce the known functional dependence of the localization length .     sites .",
    "the symbols represent the exact numerical results and the solid lines depict the fit to the functional form predicted from the scaling theory of anderson localization . specifically , the ipr is fit to the line @xmath50 , with the mean free path , @xmath51 . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]      based on the limiting behavior of the transport deduced above from the master equations , several intriguing physical aspects of the transport become apparent .",
    "for example , in the weak dephasing regime the quantum coherent nature of the transport can lead to a considerable enhancement of the diffusion constant compared with the classical estimate .",
    "for @xmath34 , this `` quantum speedup '' can be determined analytically and is given by @xmath52 which can be quite substantial for reasonable values of the systems parameters , as seen from figure  [ fig : ipr ] .",
    "the enhancement is proportional to the localization length as a result o fthe enhanced step size of the hopping process in the weak dephasing regime .",
    "secondly , in the weak dephasing regime the transport increases linearly with @xmath6   while for strong dephasing the diffusion decreases as @xmath26  , which implies that the diffusion constant should be maximal at intermediate values of the dephasing . as mentioned above ,   also predicts an optimal diffusion constant at @xmath53 .",
    "however , this estimate is only correct for very large disorder and becomes increasingly worse as the system becomes more coherent , as will be demonstrated in the numerical results presented in the next section .",
    "an improved estimate for the optimal dephasing rate may be obtained by equating the proper weak dephasing limit of   with the large dephasing result in  .",
    "this leads to the improved estimate , @xmath54 which will be shown to be substantially more accurate than the prediction provided by  .",
    "the existence of a maximum in the diffusion coefficient is a result of the interplay between the anderson localization due to static disorder and thermal localization originating from the environment  @xcite .",
    "the optimum occurs in the regime where the exact eigenstates of the total system transition between the local site basis and the exciton basis .",
    "for example , in an initially anderson localized system increasing the dephasing rate enhances the transport , but it also serves to further localize the wavefunctions which reduces the hopping length .",
    "it is this competition that is responsible for the non - monotonic behavior of the transport and is generic to many systems .",
    "similar arguments for the non - monotonic behavior of the transport have been presented in  @xcite as well as a similar estimate for the optimal dephasing rate as  .",

    "the diffusion constant becomes independent of the disorder and the results coincide with estimate of   for the homogeneous chain ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "however , one notices that as the disorder decreases and the dynamics become more coherent the classical hopping approximation quickly deteriorates in predicting both the magnitude of the diffusion constant as well as the location of the maximum . for sufficiently weak dephasing , @xmath34 ,",
    "the exact numerical results are in agreement with the numerical calculations of the redfield equation ( square symbols in figure  [ fig : diffusion ] ) .",

    "the exact and classical hopping results are approximately equivalent since an coherences generated during the time evolution of the populations are quickly destroyed by the strong dephasing . however , as the dephasing decreases the dynamics become more coherent leading to a significant increase in the ratio of @xmath59 . in the asymptotic regime",
    "where @xmath61 , the exact numerical results approach the limiting values given in   ( cross symbols ) which are determined only by the anderson localization length of the static system hamiltonian .",
    "as discussed above , the transition from coherent dynamics in the weak dephasing regime to the classical hopping dynamics is due to the fact that in addition to the static disorder , the thermal environment can also serve to localize the system .",
    "that is , the true localization length is a function of both @xmath62 and @xmath6 . in the limit @xmath29 ,",
    "the localization is entirely due to anderson localization whereas for @xmath63 the localization is largely due to the dephasing .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] [ fig : coherences ]    as mentioned , the dephasing can play an equally important role to the static disorder in localizing the system .",
    "it would be highly desirable to be able to quantify the localization that occurs due to the dephasing .",
    "this is generally affected through computations of the equilibrium reduced density matrix  @xcite",
    ". however , the equilibrium state of systems described by the hsr model is somewhat trivial due to the infinite temperature bath .",
    "each site is equally populated and the system is completely localized in the site basis . based upon this observation one would expect the classical hopping description to always be applicable , which is clearly not the case as shown above .",
    "the failure of this approach lies in the realization that there is an inherent difference between the equilibrium state in a large , but finite chain and the nonequilibrium steady - state of an infinite chain where the populations are continuously evolving .",
    "if one considers the distribution of populations , then tails of the distribution represent the sites where the population is spreading to new sites in the chain . in this region",
    "coherences are constantly being created and destroyed .",
    "the spatial extent of these coherences also reaches a steady state , and it is this coherence length that is responsible for the deviations from the classical hopping result .",
    "the interior of the probability distribution , however , equilibrates . in order to demonstrate this point more clearly , figure  [ fig : rho ] displays slices through a snapshot of the steady - state density matrix taken in the regime where an accurate estimate of the diffusion coefficient is possible .",
    "one sees that the populations ( dotted line ) display the gaussian profile expected of a diffusion process .",
    "the coherences are substantial only in the tails of the population distribution , while the interior thermalizes and becomes diagonal in the local basis . in an infinite chain",
    ", this process continues indefinitely . at longer times , the coherences in the center of the chain will be further depleted while new coherences will be created in the extremities as the populations evolve .    in order to quantify the role of dephasing in localizing the system ,",
    "it is necessary to characterize the amount of coherence present in the density matrix in the diffusive , steady - state regime .",
    "unfortunately , as seen above there is no way to unambiguously determine this coherence length . as a simple qualitative measure we will use the metric , @xmath70 computed from the steady - state density matrix in the long - time limit where a reliable estimate of the diffusion constant is possible .",
    "the correlation function @xmath71 is simply the sum of the individual superdiagonals of the density matrix displayed in figure  [ fig : rho ] .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : coherences ] , both the magnitude and spatial extent of @xmath71 clearly depend on the dephasing . for @xmath72 the dephasing may completely localize the system in the site basis regardless of the disorder .",
    "unsurprisingly , in this regime the classical hopping approximation to the transport is highly accurate as seen above in figure  [ fig : diffusion ] . in the opposite regime ,",
    "the dephasing has less influence on localizing the system , and the extent of the wavefunctions is predominantly determined by the anderson localization due to static disorder .",
    "optimal diffusion occurs in the intermediate regime , where both the noise and disorder play a role in the localization of the wavefunctions .",
    "it is interesting to explore the question if the thermal localization can be used to extend the regime of validity of the scaling behavior obtained from the redfield equation in  . to this end , we propose a simple ansatz for a dephasing - dependent correction to localization length , @xmath73 , with @xmath74 , which leads to the corresponding diffusion constant , @xmath75 the behavior of @xmath76 can be determined by noting that for disordered systems , @xmath71 falls off exponentially for large @xmath77 regardless of the dephasing .",

    "from the steady - state density matrix , we compute @xmath71 and then fit the exponential decay at large @xmath77 to obtain @xmath76 .",
    "the results of this procedure for computing the dephasing - corrected diffusion coefficient are displayed in figure  [ fig : gamma_loc ] . for small dephasing rates ,",
    "the modified diffusion coefficient corrects the overestimation of   and even predicts the turnover seen in the exact results .",
    "the agreement with the exact numerical results is of course only qualitative , but one could easily devise a more sophisticated approach by demanding , for example , that   also reproduces the correct large dephasing limit .",
    "however the main point of this argument is to provide and intuitive illustration of the influence of dephasing and disorder on the transport dynamics discussed above .",
    "while perhaps useful , it should be noted that this procedure for correcting the weak dephasing scaling limit is not a constructive approach .",
    "that is , computing the dephasing - induced localization length requires the steady - state density matrix , which alone is sufficient to determine the exact diffusion constant .",
    "however , a more direct and accurate approach to characterize the thermal localization length could prove a useful route to a uniform approximation of the diffusion constant .",
    "although the above discussion provides a physically motivated uniform approximating to the diffusion coefficient , a simple alternative has been proposed by thouless and kirkpatrick  @xcite .",

    "the spectrum is quite broad , but the diffusion rate is also negligible ( see  ) , which is also not optimal . as a result ,",
    "engineering a material with both favorable transport properties and a absorption profile requires a delicate balance of the disorder and dephasing .",

    "finally the influence of the noise and disorder on the spectral lineshapes and the relation between the absorption spectrum and the optimal transport regime have been presented in the context of organic photovoltaic materials .",
