    "the eigenvectors fulfill the bi - orthogonality and closure relations in the form @xmath12 the two relations are invariant with respect to the scale transformation @xmath13 with arbitrary non - zero coefficients @xmath14 s . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , an overlap of the left and right eigenvectors is defined in the following way @xmath15 by construction , the quantity @xmath16 is invariant with respect to the scale transformation given by eq .   and consequently does not depend on the vector normalizations .",

    ", this invariance implies that @xmath23 and @xmath24 for any @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it follows that @xmath27 we can also define the local diagonal overlap density by the formula @xmath28 and the off - diagonal one by @xmath29 clearly , the diagonal global overlap is equal to the integrated overlap density given by eq .  ,",
    "consider the product @xmath31 of @xmath0 independent identically distributed @xmath1 ginibre random matrices  @xcite with complex entries .",

    "in order to calculate the global left - right vector overlap , defined by eq .  , for the product of ginibre matrices  , we will change the parametrization of the matrices @xmath41 s using the generalized schur decomposition  @xcite @xmath42 for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are unitary matrices from the unitary group @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are upper triangular matrices of size @xmath1 .",

    "<S> we develop a method to calculate left - right eigenvector correlations of the product of @xmath0 independent @xmath1 complex ginibre matrices . for illustration , we present explicit analytical results for the vector overlap for a couple of examples for small @xmath0 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the integrated overlap between left and right eigenvectors is given by the formula @xmath3 and support this conjecture by analytical and numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an analytical expression for the limiting correlation density as @xmath4 for the product of ginibre matrices as well as for the product of elliptic matrices . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the correlation function is independent of the eccentricities of the elliptic laws . </S>"
