    "we call this the archaeology approach. the confrontation with predictions from models of galaxy formation is certainly most meaningful , when the two approaches , the mining of the high - redshift universe and the archaeology of local galaxies set consistent constraints . in this paper we follow the latter approach .    the main challenge in the archaeology of stellar population is the disentanglement of age and metallicity effects .",
    "the use of absorption line indices to lift this degeneracy is powerful @xcite , but has been up to now hampered by the fact that different metallic line indices yield different metallicities and therefore different ages ( see references above ) .",
    "we have solved this problem by developing stellar population models that include element abundance ratio effects and now allow for an un - ambiguous derivation of age , total metallicity , and element ratios from ( lick ) absorption line indices ( * ? ? ? * hereafter tmb ) . a complication that remains , however , is the degeneracy between age and horizontal branch morphology , which stems from the fact that the presence of warm horizontal branch stars ( which can not be excluded ) strengthens the balmer absorption and can mimic a younger stellar population age @xcite .",
    "we will additionally discuss this problem in the present paper .",
    "the principal aim of this study is to constrain the formation epochs of the stellar populations in early - type galaxies as a function of their type ( elliptical and lenticular ) , mass and environmental density . for this purpose",
    "we analyze a homogeneous , high - quality data sample of 124 early - type galaxies in various environmental densities . with our new stellar population models ( tmb )",
    "we determine ages , total metallicities , and @xmath0  ratios from the absorption line indices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , and seek for possible correlations of these parameters with velocity dispersion .",
    "first tentative results have already been discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we present the final and more comprehensive analysis .",
    "in particular , we compare the observed data set with mock samples produced through monte carlo simulations taking the typical average observational errors into account , in order to eliminate the confusion caused by correlated errors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0  element ratio plays a key role for the accomplishment of our main goal , namely the derivation of formation epochs , while the so - called @xmath21-elements o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , ti ( particles that are build up with @xmath21-particle nuclei ) plus the elements n and na are delivered mainly by type  ii supernova explosions of massive progenitor stars , a substantial fraction of the fe - peak elements fe and cr comes from the delayed exploding type  ia supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the @xmath0  ratio quantifies the relative importance of type  ii and type  ia supernovae @xcite , and therefore carries information about the timescale over which star formation occurs .",
    "thus , the @xmath0  ratio can be considered as an additional measure of late star formation , and we will use it both to constrain formation timescales and to lift the degeneracy between age and horizontal branch morphology .",

    "they are based on the evolutionary population synthesis code of @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the impact from element ratio changes is computed with the help of the @xcite response functions , using an extension of the method introduced by @xcite .",

    "the models allow for the clear distinction between total metallicity [ @xmath2 and the @xmath21 to iron - peak elements ratio [ @xmath0 ] .",
    "we use these models to derive the three stellar population parameters age , metallicity , and @xmath0  ratio from the three line indices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  in a twofold iterative procedure explained below .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there is a degeneracy between age and horizontal branch morphology .",
    "a way to lift this degeneracy is the consideration of the @xmath0  ratio .",
    "we expect young stellar populations generally to be characterized by lower @xmath0  ratios owing to the late enrichment of fe from type  ia supernovae .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed investigation of the data set based on monte carlo simulations as shall be discussed in the following sections .",
    "however , first tentative conclusions can already be drawn by the direct comparison between the observational data and ssp model grids , as discussed in the following .",
    "the index @xmath29^{\\prime}$ ]  is a good tracer of total metallicity ( still degenerate with age , of course ) , as it is almost completely independent of @xmath0  ratio variations ( tmb ) . as also @xmath18  is only very little sensitive to @xmath0  ( tmb ) , the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : datagrid ] are well suited to read off ages and total metallicities independent of abundance ratio effects .",
    "the sample splits in two subclasses divided by the balmer absorption index at @xmath31 .",
    "the main part of the data is centered around @xmath32 , while about one quarter of the objects have relatively high @xmath18  absorption implying the presence of either young stellar populations or blue horizontal branch morphologies @xcite .",
    "this surprisingly well - defined separation is also discussed in @xcite for the coma cluster objects alone .",
    "interestingly , the pattern is still present for the larger galaxy sample considered here , and in particular the fraction of high @xmath18objects seems to be independent of the environmental density ( fig .  [ fig : datagrid ] ) , but we do not find a significant difference with respect to the galaxy type .",
    "[ fig : datagrid ] further hints toward a difference between objects as a function of environment within the old ( low @xmath18 ) class , in the sense that galaxies in low density environments seem to have on average slightly younger ages and higher metallicities .",
    "this difference is more clearly visible in the direct comparison of the derived ages discussed below .      the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : datagrid ] can be used to get rough estimates for the @xmath0  ratios of the sample galaxies .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the @xmath19-@xmath20  plane is not completely degenerate in age , and the ages derived from the top panels have to be taken into account for the precise derivation of @xmath0  ratios .",
    "still we can infer from the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : datagrid ] that the @xmath0  ratios range roughly between solar and two times solar , and that objects with strong @xmath19  indices , hence velocity dispersion because of the mg-@xmath9 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , tend to have higher @xmath0  ratios .",
    "at least no obvious impact from environmental density on the @xmath0  ratios is visible .",
    "the stellar population parameters are derived in a two - fold iterative procedure .",
    "first , we arbitrarily fix the @xmath0  ratio , and determine ages and metallicities for the index pairs ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) and ( @xmath18,@xmath20 ) , by starting with arbitrary age - metallicity pairs , which we modify iteratively until both index pairs are reproduced .",
    "the two metallicities obtained from @xmath19  and @xmath20 , respectively , are used to adjust the @xmath0  ratio , and to start a new iteration .",
    "these steps are repeated until the age - metallicity pairs derived from ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) and ( @xmath18,@xmath20 ) at a given @xmath0  ratio are consistent within 1 per cent accuracy .",
    "for ages and metallicities between the grid points quoted above , we interpolate linearly .",
    "the resulting ages , metallicities , and @xmath0  for the sample under investigation are listed in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "an uncomfortable effect of the degeneracy between age and metallicity is that the errors of these stellar population parameters are not independent .",
    "it is still a matter of debate , for instance , whether the age - metallicity anti - correlation found for early - type galaxies in a number of studies is an artifact caused by correlated errors @xcite .",
    "a possibility to get a handle on these effects is the performance of monte carlo simulations taking into account the observational uncertainties of the line indices from which the stellar population parameters are derived .",
    "@xcite follow this method in order to assess the relationship between ages and metallicities of 72 early - type galaxies by comparison with a mock sample produced through monte carlo simulations .    in this paper",
    "we extend the approach of @xcite to the full parameter space including also @xmath0  ratios besides age and total metallicity .",
    "we produce a sample of artificial galaxies with given ages , metallicities , and @xmath0  ratios , from which we compute with the tmb ssp models the line indices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . by means of monte carlo simulations we perturb these exact values with the 1-@xmath9 errors quoted above , assuming a gaussian error distribution .",

    "indeed , @xcite have already shown that velocity dispersion is the only structural parameter that is found to modulate the stellar populations of galaxies . as we aim at deriving average properties , simple stellar populations of single age and single chemical composition are used .",
    "we start with the velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ) distribution of the data sample shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histsig ] . based on arbitrarily chosen relationships ,",
    "we assign to every @xmath9 an age , metallicity , and @xmath0  ratio , which we transform into @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "these indices are then perturbed with the observational error ( see above ) adopting a gaussian probability distribution . in this way",
    "we obtain a mock galaxy sample that is closest to the observational situation in terms of size , velocity dispersion distribution , and error perturbation .",
    "if necessary , we add an intrinsic scatter in the stellar population parameters age , metallicity , and @xmath0 .",
    "this step is repeated , until the majority of the observed data points in the index - index diagrams @xmath29^{\\prime}$ ]  vs.  @xmath18  and @xmath19  vs.  @xmath20  is reproduced ( comparison by eye ) .",
    "the quality of the fit is further checked with respect to the zero points , slopes , and scatter of the relationships between the stellar parameters ( age , metallicity , @xmath0ratio ) and velocity dispersion . by means of the index - index diagrams we identify those objects that are not reproduced by the mock data sample based on the simple relationships introduced in this step .",
    "\\2 ) in a second step , we therefore perturb the general simple scaling laws found in the first step in 2-component models in order to match those remaining objects .",
    "like before , we adopt the exact @xmath9 distribution of the outliers and assign age , metallicity and @xmath0  to every @xmath9 based on the above final relationships to define the base population .",
    "then we add a second component with arbitrary stellar population parameters and determine the index values of this composite population .",
    "these are then perturbed like in the first step and compared to the observational data .",
    "we note that the contribution in mass of the second component is treated as the forth free parameter , hence the solutions will not be unique , as we have only three observables as constraints ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",

    "our result suggests that the significant mass growth in the early - type galaxy population below @xmath15 observed by @xcite is most likely caused by less massive objects .",
    "one fundamental consequence from the results of this paper is the prediction that very massive objects @xmath157 ) with very high star formation rates up to several @xmath158@xmath111/yr should be present between redshifts 2 and  5 .",

    "finally , deeper redshift surveys are now finding evolved objects even at redshifts around 2 and 3 @xcite and massive star forming objects around redshifts 2 and 5 @xcite up to @xmath164 @xcite , again in good agreement with the prediction from the properties of local galaxies made in this paper .    to conclude",

    "this picture gets some theoretical support from the fact that the kinematics of massive early - type galaxies require the origin of mergers between bulge - dominated rather than disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , in this case , it would be difficult for early - type galaxies to establish the correlation between metallicity and mass reported here .",
    "more fundamental modifications of the models are certainly necessary .",
    "@xcite have presented a promising  even though quite heuristic  approach , in which star formation is enhanced in massive systems because of feedback between star formation and agn activity ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this idea is now put on physical grounds in @xcite , where the evolution of gas in a dark matter halo is described as a function of gravity , radiative cooling , heating by feedback from supernovae , and  most importantly  heating by feedback from the growing active nucleus .",
    "the assumption of a tight interplay between star formation and nuclear activity gets indeed strong observational support from the fact that besides the @xmath0  ratio , also black hole mass correlates with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "the resulting anti - hierarchical baryonic collapse in the @xcite model leads to higher formation redshifts and shorter formation timescales of the stellar populations in massive halos . in this way both the relationship between @xmath0  ratio and galaxy mass @xcite , and the presence of old galaxies at @xmath15 ( eros ) and of violently star forming objects at @xmath139 ( scuba sources ) are reproduced .",
    "@xcite consider the evolution of massive halos in the framework of semi - analytic models only above redshifts @xmath166 .",
    "hence , a fundamental problem that remains to be solved is the accretion of cold gas onto the central galaxy of a dark matter halo at lower redshift leading to late star formation and the galaxy s rejuvenation .    an important step to a solution of this latter problem",
    "might have been recently made by @xcite , who suggests a scenario in which gas cooling is the key process . unlike small systems with shallow potential wells , massive galaxies can not eject but retain their hot gas , the cooling of which is inhibited by an episodically active galactic nucleus .",
    "this atmosphere of hot gas builds up a shield around the galaxy preventing cool gas to fall in and to form stars .",
    "the inclusion of this effect in semi - analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation would certainly be the right step toward reconciling our current understanding of galaxy formation with the observational constraints set by the stellar populations properties of massive galaxies .",

    "we find that all three stellar population parameters age , total metallicity , and @xmath0  ratio correlate with velocity dispersion , hence galaxy mass .",
    "we show that these results are robust against recent revisions of the local abundance pattern at high metallicities . to recover the observed scatter we need to assume an intrinsic scatter of about 20 per cent in age , @xmath1dex in [ @xmath2 and @xmath3dex in [ @xmath0 ] .",

    "is less convincing because of relatively high @xmath0  ratios .",
    "3 ) most intriguing is a population of massive ( @xmath157 or @xmath170km / s ) s0 galaxies , only present in the high density sample , that require a major fraction of their stars ( @xmath171 per cent ) to have formed relatively recently at lookback times of about @xmath172@xmath173gyr , corresponding to @xmath174 .",
    "note that these objects , even though being interesting in themselves , represent only a minor fraction of the total stellar mass budget in early - type galaxies .",
    "the increase of total metallicity , indicating the completeness of chemical processing , mainly reflects the inability of massive galaxies with deeper potential wells to develop galactic winds .",
    "the increase of age and @xmath0  ratio with @xmath9 shows that more massive galaxies form their stellar populations both earlier and faster .",

    "the increase of @xmath0  with velocity dispersion is responsible for the much weaker correlation of @xmath20  with galaxy mass .    with a simple chemical evolution model that takes the delayed enrichment from type  ia supernovae into account , we translate the ages and @xmath0  ratios of the above relationships into star formation histories as a functions of galaxy s velocity dispersions and environmental densities .",
    "we show that the higher ages and @xmath0  ratios of more massive early - type galaxies imply faster formation timescales at earlier epochs .",

    "we conclude that significant mass growth in the early - type galaxy population below @xmath15 must be restricted to less massive objects , and a significant increase of the stellar mass density between redshifts 1 and 2 should be present caused mainly by the field galaxy population . as shown here",

    "in a recent study , @xcite argue that the correlation of @xmath0  with velocity dispersion is an artefact of incomplete calibration ( of the models ) to the lick system. the basis for their conclusion is the recent finding of @xcite , that the milky way disk stars with super - solar metallicities do not have solar but sub - solar o / fe ratios , o / fe decreasing with increasing fe / h ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar population models , being calibrated with these stars , are then likely to reflect sub - solar o / fe ratios at high metallicities . if the element oxygen is taken as representative for all @xmath21-elements , this would obviously lead to an overestimation of the o / fe ratio ( or @xmath0  ratio ) in stellar populations with super - solar metallicities like early - type galaxies .",

    "this differential pattern between oxygen and the other @xmath21-elements can not be neglected in models taking the local abundance pattern at high metallicities into account .",
    "this is particularly important in the context of this work , as the @xmath0  ratios presented here are derived from the absorption line indices @xmath19  and @xmath20 , which are sensitive mostly to the elements fe and mg , but _ not _ o @xcite .",
    "we investigated this issue constructing two additional flavors of stellar population models that account for the local abundance pattern at high metallicity .",

    "<S> the aim of this paper is to set constraints of the epochs of early - type galaxy formation through the archaeology of the stellar populations in local galaxies . using our models of absorption line indices that account for variable abundance ratios </S>",

    "<S> the data are analyzed by comparison with mock galaxy samples created through monte carlo simulations taking the typical average observational errors into account , in order to eliminate artifacts caused by correlated errors . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all three parameters age , metallicity , and @xmath0  ratio are correlated with velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these results are robust against recent revisions of the local abundance pattern at high metallicities . to recover the observed scatter we need to assume an intrinsic scatter of about 20 per cent in age , @xmath1dex in [ @xmath2 and @xmath3dex in [ @xmath0 ] . </S>",

    "<S> about 20 per cent of the intermediate - mass objects with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , both ellipticals and lenticulars ) must have either a young subpopulation or a blue horizontal branch . </S>",
    "<S> based on the above relationships valid for the bulk of the sample , we show that the mg-@xmath9 relation is mainly driven by metallicity , with similar shares from the @xmath0  ratio ( @xmath10 per cent ) and age ( @xmath11 per cent ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further find evidence for an influence of the environment on the stellar population properties . </S>",
    "<S> massive early - type galaxies in low - density environments appear on average @xmath12gyrs younger and slightly ( @xmath13  dex ) more metal - rich than their counterparts in high density environments . </S>",
    "<S> no offsets in the @xmath0ratios , instead , are detected . with the aid of a simple chemical evolution model , </S>",
    "<S> we translate the derived ages and @xmath0  ratios into star formation histories . </S>",
    "<S> we show that most star formation activity in early - type galaxies is expected to have happened between redshifts @xmath14 and 5 in high density and between redshifts 1 and 2 in low density environments . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that at least 50 per cent of the total stellar mass density must have already formed at @xmath15 , in good agreement with observational estimates of the total stellar mass density as a function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that significant mass growth in the early - type galaxy population below @xmath15 must be restricted to less massive objects , and a significant increase of the stellar mass density between redshifts 1 and 2 should be present caused mainly by the field galaxy population . </S>",
