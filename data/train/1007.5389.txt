    "long lifetimes of metastable states are dominated by these forbidden transitions and these states are generally difficult to observe in the laboratory plasmas due to strong collisions .",
    "however , these forbidden transitions of mo vi have been observed in laboratory in electron spin resonance experiment @xcite and therefore , they must be one of the sources of density estimations in astrophysical plasmas where collisions are very low due to high dilute interstellar medium @xcite",

    "hexavelent molybdenum , isoelectronic to rubidium with 4p@xmath24d as ground state configuration , is generated by electron impact in the atomic collision process .",
    "the electron - impact ionization of multiply charged mo ions , relevant to astrophysics and laboratory plasma research , have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "recently , fisker et al .",
    "have given the possibility of the origin of the lightest isotope of molybdenum in proton rich type ii supernova @xcite .",
    "the necessity of accurate estimation of allowed dipole transition strengths to find out their mixing these effects in the dipole forbidden transitions in mo vi is explicitly discussed by t. yamamoto @xcite .",
    "again , the transition strength between the fine structure states of 4d lavel can reflect the electronic structure of mo vi in crystal @xcite .",
    "a few calculations have been carried out to study the on electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions in mo vi over the last few decades using the mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "more recently , j. reader @xcite has estimated the e1 transition probabilities among low - lying states by estimating transition strengths in the semiempirical approach with the experimental excitation energies .",
    "for this single reference system , mo vi , we have performed relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) calculation with single ( s ) , double ( d ) and partial triple ( t ) excitations in the framework of fock space multi - reference ( fsmr ) .",
    "both the excitation energies and transition probabilities are determined using this rcc method using which lifetimes of many low - lying states are estimated .",
    "the oscillator strength for e1 transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is given as @xmath5[eq7 ] where @xmath6 is the excitation energy between the upper and lower states and @xmath7 is the degeneracy factor of the upper state with total angular momentum @xmath8 .",
    "the single particle reduced matrix elements for the e1 , e2 and m1 transition operators are given in @xcite .",
    "the emission transition probabilities ( in sec@xmath9 ) for the e1 , e2 and m1 channels from states _ f _ to _ i _ can be expressed as @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the transition strength for the coressponding operator @xmath14 ( in a.u . ) and @xmath15 ( in  ) is the corresponding transition wavelength .",
    "the lifetime of a particular excited state @xmath16 can be computed by the reciprocal of the total transition probability , @xmath17 ( in sec@xmath9 ) , arising from all possible states @xmath18 due to spontaneous electromagnetic transitions , i.e. @xmath19      the fsmrcc method is one of the most powerful highly correlated many - body approaches due to its all order structure to account the correlation effects @xcite .",
    "the fsmrcc , which is mainly meant for multi - reference systems , is used here for the one valence electron and has been described in details elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we present the method briefly .",
    "we first consider the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian for a closed - shell @xmath20 electron system which is given by @xmath21+\\sum_{i < j}^{n}\\frac{1}{r_{ij}}\\ ] ] with all the standard notations often used .",
    "the theory for a single valence system is based on the concept of common vacuum for both the closed shell @xmath20- and open shell @xmath22-electron systems , which allows us to formulate a direct method to determine energy differences ( electron attachment energy or negative of the ionization potential ) .",
    "also , the holes and particles are defined with respect to the common vacuum for both the electron systems .",
    "model space of an ( n , m ) fock - space contains determinants of @xmath23 holes and @xmath24 particles distributed within a set of orbitals known as _ active _ orbitals .",
    "for example , in the present article , we are dealing with ( 0,1 ) fock - space which is a complete model space ( cms ) by construction and is given by    @xmath25 s are the expansion coefficients of @xmath26 , and @xmath27 s are the model space configurations made of df orbitals .",
    "the dynamical electron correlation effects are introduced through the _ valence - universal _ wave - operator @xmath28 @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 at this juncture , it is convenient to single out the core - cluster amplitudes @xmath31 and call them @xmath32 .",
    "the rest of the cluster amplitudes will henceforth be called @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath28 is in normal ordered , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq2.5 ] ) as @xmath34 the `` valence - universal '' wave - operator @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.7 ] ) is parameterized in such a way that the states generated by its action on the reference space satisfy the fock - space bloch equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 here , p is the projection operator of model space .",
    "( [ eq2.8 ] ) is valid for all ( k , l ) starting from k = l=0 ( i.e. , the _ core _ problem ) to some desired _ parent _ model space , with k = m ,",
    "l = n . in this present calculation , we truncate eq .",
    "( [ eq2.6 ] ) at @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    in this work ,",
    "single ( @xmath39 ) and double ( @xmath40 ) excitations are considered for @xmath32 and @xmath33 clusters operator .",
    "therefore , the total correlated wavefunction of the system with single valence orbital _ v _ , can be written as @xmath41 important triple excitations , correspond to the correlation to the valence orbitals , are included in the open shell fsmrcc - sd calculations by an approximation that is similar in spirit to fsmrcc - sd(t ) @xcite . the approximate valence",
    "triple excitation amplitudes are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the amplitudes corresponding to the simultaneous excitations from core orbitals @xmath44 and valence @xmath45 to virtual orbitals @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are the connected composites involving @xmath50 and @xmath32 , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , where @xmath50 is the two electron coulomb ( @xmath52)integral and @xmath53 s are the orbital energies .    the transition matrix element due to any operator @xmath14 can be expressed as @xmath54",
    "in the present calculation , the radial wavefunctions of df orbitals of closed shell mo vii are obtained using gaussian type orbitals ( gto ) basis with finite nuclear size as discussed in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "we have used universal basis set , where the exponent @xmath55 is related with two parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 , same for all the symmetries , expressed as @xmath58 we have considered @xmath56 and @xmath57 as 0.00625 and 2.72 , respectively , after obtaining best fit of the bound orbital energies and evaluating the expectation values of different radial functions ( @xmath47 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) generated with gtos and grasp2 @xcite . in the df calculations ,",
    "we have taken 22 , 20 , 17 , 15 , and 12 number of gtos for s , p , d , f , and g type symmetries , respectively , to generate the atomic orbitals . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we have given the relative errors obtained for different orbitals in the calculations of these quantities using the above chosen parameters .",
    "since these errors are very small , it shows that there is a good agreement between results .",
    "we assume that both the bound and continuum orbitals generated using the above parameters will describe well both inside and outside of the nucleus .",
    "therefore , we have considered all the orbitals obtained using gtos for the rest of the calculations .",
    "the number of the df orbitals for different symmetries used in the present calculation is based on convergent criteria of core correlation energy of mo vii for which it satisfies numerical completeness .",
    "the number of df orbitals considered for s , p , d , f , and g type symmetries in the rcc calculations are 12 , 11 , 10 , 9 and 8 , respectively ; and among them 9 , 8 , 7 , 5 , and 5 are bound orbitals , respectively , including all the core orbitals .",
    "the @xmath32 amplitudes are first determined by solving the closed shell rcc equations for the closed - shell system ( mo vii ) , then @xmath33 amplitudes are solved from the open - shell equations for the single - valence states of mo vi .    the relative energies and expectation values of @xmath47 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the df gto orbitals to the df grasp orbitals.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    table i summarizes the calculated excitation energies ( ee ) and fine structure splitting ( fs ) of low - lying excited states and their comparison with the recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "the average deviation is around 0.5% for ee .",
    "we have also presented the contribution from the partial triple excitations to the ee ( e@xmath61 ) , which is around 0.3% to the total ee .",
    "we have examined the first order excitation energy corrections due to breit interaction using large scale relativistic ci calculations .",
    "maximum contribution is coming for 5s state , which is around @xmath62 , whereas , contributions to 5p and 4f states are around @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; respectively . for 5d state , it is as small as 54 @xmath65 consistent with the result obtained by pan and beck @xcite .",
    "since , the contributions due to breit interaction are relatively small , we do not consider them here selfconsistently to evaluate wavefunctions .",
    ".excitation energies ( ee ) and fine structure splitting ( fs ) ( in cm@xmath9 ) of mo vi and their comparison with experimental results .",

    "the lifetime of the 4d @xmath68 state is found to be around 5 second , which will be useful in many physical processes .",
    "contributions of different correlation terms are discussed and found strong effect from higher order core - polarization . in the near future",
