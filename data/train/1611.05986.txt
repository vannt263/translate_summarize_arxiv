    "recently , the early - type galaxy ngc  1277 in the perseus cluster received much attention because , according to stellar kinematics observations , it most likely hides an over - massive black hole of @xmath2@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "galaxies with the most massive black holes are interesting on their own , because they may serve as probes for black hole formation models ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , may indicate capture of a runaway black hole @xcite , and may constrain black hole ",
    "galaxy co - evolution models @xcite .",
    "the most massive black holes are also excellent targets to test accretion theory models @xcite .",
    "the ultra - massive black hole in ngc  1277 may be still actively accreting mass although it is located in a normal galaxy according to optical and infrared observations . westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) observations revealed a compact radio counterpart with a total flux density of 2.9  mjy at 1.4  ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also noticed that there are more radio detections of the normal early - type galaxies in the wide - field wsrt image of the perseus cluster .",
    "their radio emission is likely related to parsec - scale jet activity , powered by their central supermassive black holes , rather than star formation . in order to verify this scenario , we imaged five galaxies including ngc  1277 in the central region of the perseus cluster with the very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) technique .",
    "vlbi imaging observations are a direct and reliable way of revealing low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ;",
    "@xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 , * ? ? ?",
    "supporting vlbi evidence for agn emission often include quite high brightness temperatures ( @xmath6  k ) , radio luminosities exceeding that of nearby known nuclear supernova remnant ( snr ) complexes ( @xmath7 ) , and non - thermal flat radio spectra ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the radio emission may also come from nuclear star formation activity in the host galaxies @xcite , while most of the star formation - related radio emission typically has @xmath8  k @xcite .",
    "young radio supernovae ( sne ) and snrs may appear as compact sources in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while they have a decaying flux density and are often resolvable at the later stage with milliarcsecond ( mas ) resolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the five early - type galaxies with wsrt radio counterparts are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "they were selected because they are within a circle of about 5 arcminutes from 3c  84 , one of the central galaxies in the perseus cluster .",
    "the selection criteria enabled us to re - use an existing european vlbi network ( evn ) experiment , which was designed to study hi gas in ngc  1275/3c  84 ( oonk et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , by re - correlation of the raw data at new positions .",
    "to get sub - mjy image sensitivity , we restrict our targets within the main beam of the effelsberg 100  m radio telescope ( full width at half maximum : about 10 arcminutes at 1.4  ghz ) .",
    "this instrumental restriction implies that we can only investigate a handful of the most centrally located early type galaxies in the perseus cluster , and as such this sample is not complete in any sense .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the evn observation and our data reduction methods . in section 3",
    ", we present the vlbi detection of these wsrt sources . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the possible explanations for the vlbi imaging results and the implications for an over - massive black hole in ngc  1277 . in section 5 , we conclude that all the five early - type galaxies are most likely llagns .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . at @xmath12 , the mean redshift of the five galaxies , an angular size of 1  mas corresponds to a linear size of 0.3  pc .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,>,<,^,^,^,^ , > , < \" , ]     [ table2 ]      flat or inverted spectrum radio cores in quasars are well - known to be related to the optically thick base of synchrotron jets @xcite .",
    "partially synchrotron self - absorbed jets are also ubiquitous in llagns , but in that case these are related to radiatively inefficient accretion in `` hard state '' black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there are however alternative explanations for compact cores in llagn , like free - free emission from an x - ray heated accretion disk wind and at relatively lower brightness temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or synchrotron emission absorbed by the surrounding thermal gas in the nuclear region ( free - free absorption , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "low resolution wsrt observations at 1.4 and 5  ghz by @xcite show that three of our target sources ( ngc  1270 , ngc  1277 and ngc  1278 ) have flat spectra ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ) .",
    "these flat spectra , in addition to the evn observed high brightness temperatures in four of our target sources supports the llagn origin , regardless of the exact emission mechanism .",
    "the best evidence for llagn activity however exists for the target source that has a very steep spectrum and by far the lowest evn / wsrt flux density ratio : ngc  1272 was shown to have a pair of bent , extended radio jets on arcsecond scales @xcite .",
    "we inspected if there are signs of agn activity in the x - ray ( _ chandra _ or _ rosat _ ) , optical ( sloan digital sky survey ( _ sdss _ ) ; * ? ? ? * ) and infrared ( wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ) ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "to date , we believe that the strongest evidence for llagn activity in the five sources comes from the radio .    among the five sources ,",
    "ngc  1277 , ngc  1278 and vzw  339 have been detected by _",
    "chandra _ in the energy range of 0.5    7 kev .",
    "their absorption - corrected luminosities , listed in table  [ table2 ] , are on the orders of @xmath15  ergs@xmath5 @xcite , which is typical for llagns .",
    "the three sources have a power law x - ray spectra with a photon index consisting with the expectation from llagns instead of low mass x - ray binaries ( too steep , * ? ? ?",
    "we also computed the ratio between the radio and x - ray luminosities for these three sources .",
    "the ratio is about @xmath16 for ngc  1277 , @xmath17 for ngc  1278 , and @xmath18 for vzw  339 .",
    "they are at least one order higher than the gdel - benz relation , @xmath19 , which is observed by @xcite for the radio - quiet palomar - green quasar sample and where @xmath20 is the radio luminosity at 5  ghz and @xmath21 is the bolometric 0.2    20  kev x - ray luminosity . together with their high brightness temperature and the absence of large variability , we are in favour of synchrotron emission from compact jets rather than free - free emission from accretion disk winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the five llagns .",
    "optical spectroscopy exists for vzw  339 and ngc  1270 ( _ sdss _ ) , and ngc  1277 @xcite .",
    "these spectra show no prominent emission lines such as @xmath225007 .",
    "@xcite show that typical strong agns have luminosity @xmath23 .",
    "the maximally allowed luminosity in ngc  1270 , ngc  1277 and vzw  339 is about @xmath24 .",
    "this indicates that a strong agn is not present in these galaxies and is consistent with a llagn scenario .",
    "all five targets were also observed as part of the h@xmath25 survey by @xcite .",
    "ngc  1270 , ngc  1272 and ngc  1277 were not detected in this survey , implying @xmath26  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "ngc  1278 and vzw  339 were found to have @xmath27  erg  s@xmath5 and @xmath28  erg  s@xmath5 respectively . in both cases the h@xmath25 emission",
    "was observed to be extended on scales of 10    20  kpc , thus implying a non - nuclear origin .    on the basis of data from the _ wise _",
    "survey , we classified our targets using the mid - infrared colour - colour diagram @xcite . all of them are located in the normal elliptical galaxy regime , as shown in figure 2 , indicating that their emission is dominated by normal starlight . note that the diagram is defined for luminous agns @xcite . in this context ,",
    "the location of our target galaxies in this diagram is not surprising .",
    "[ figure2 ]      the compact lenticular galaxy , ngc  1277 , was found by @xcite to have an over - massive black hole of @xmath29 , which corresponds to 14 percent of the total stellar mass of that galaxy .",
    "the fraction is much larger than the typical value ( 0.1 percent ) found in a normal massive galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also noticed that this galaxy fails to follow the correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity .",
    "the later optical dynamical analysis by @xcite achieved a consistent mass estimation . while , recent optical studies by @xcite gave an order of magnitude smaller mass , @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite found the black hole mass of @xmath31 from near - infrared integral field unit observations , which is consistent with the result from dynamical realisations @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite estimated the black hole mass of @xmath32 from gas kinematics .",
    "using infrared _ k_-band luminosity only , @xcite determined a much smaller black hole mass , @xmath33 .",
    "the radio luminosity from partially synchrotron self - absorbed compact jets scales with the hard x - ray luminosity in 2    10  kev and the mass from stellar - mass to supermassive black holes in a predictable way ,",
    "i.e. the fundamental plane ( fp ) relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fp relations , as regressed for the black hole mass by @xcite , using a dataset including sub - eddington black holes collected by @xcite , is the following : @xmath34 currently , it is not well understood under what exact conditions and up to what extremes in luminosity and mass the fp - relations may be applied .",
    "an important caveat in estimating black hole mass directly from the measured radio and x - ray luminosities is that the various instruments probe very different linear scales because of the large differences in angular resolution , and the measurements are often not contemporaneous @xcite . on the other hand , if the dominating source of emission is very compact , then both instruments probe the same source of emission .    using the best resolution _",
    "measurement @xcite and our vlbi measurement , we find a black hole mass @xmath35 for ngc  1277 .",
    "this is fully in agreement with the black hole mass estimated by @xcite from its infrared luminosity . in another two sources",
    "ngc  1278 and vzw  339 with the known x - ray luminosity @xcite , black hole masses are found in the range of @xmath36 .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude larger than derived via their infrared luminosity @xcite .    the uncertainty of the mass estimation using the fp relation is certainly not small , such as @xmath37 dex by @xcite .",
    "the fp relation is not a well - established tool for accurately measuring the mass of individual supermassive black holes , rather , it describes the hard - state black hole population in a statistical way .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear whether all the x - ray emission comes from the compact jet in ngc  1277 .",
    "thus , the large difference of 1.6 dex from the optical measurement by @xcite is still acceptable . with the fp relation ,",
    "we have no significant evidence for or against an ultra - massive black hole residing in ngc  1277 .",
    "with very high resolution and sensitive evn observations of the central 10 arcminute region of the perseus cluster , we studied the origin of radio emission in five early - type galaxies including ngc  1277 , which hosts a promising ultra - massive black hole .",
    "we detected radio emission compact on the parsec scale in all the five galaxies although they have no sign of agn activity in the optical and infrared bands .",
    "given that these vlbi - detected radio sources are quite compact and have high brightness temperature and relatively stable flux density on time scale of years , we argue that they are linked to jet activities , powered by the central supermassive black holes in llagns , instead of nuclear star formation . there is no significant evidence for or against classifying ngc  1277 as an over - massive black hole found from the fundamental plane relation .",
    "our studies also show that vlbi is a powerful technique of searching for llagns especially in case of normal galaxies .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "we are grateful to richard plotkin for providing the data they used for regressing the fundamental plane relations and ger de bruyn for supplying the wsrt images .",
