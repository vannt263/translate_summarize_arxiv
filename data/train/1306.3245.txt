    "the study of chiral asymmetry in the normal state of relativistic matter in a magnetic field is at present a very active research area in particle physics , with important developments also in condensed matter physics .",
    "although a chirally asymmetric response of relativistic matter to an external magnetic field was discovered long ago @xcite , the recent interest in this subject is connected with the theoretical prediction of the chiral magnetic effect in refs .",
    "@xcite and the subsequent experimental observation of the star collaboration of charge separation in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the physical and mathematical reasons for the chiral asymmetry in relativistic matter in a magnetic field are quite transparent ( for a recent elegant exposition , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in a free theory , the magnetic field @xmath0 projects the spins of fermions on the lowest landau level ( lll ) along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "since fermions can freely propagate in a magnetic field only along or opposite to the direction of @xmath0 and the helicity of massless fermions is the same as their chirality , magnetized relativistic matter responds chirally asymmetrically to the magnetic field .",
    "this leads to the appearance of a nondissipative axial current @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this effect is known as the chiral separation effect in the literature ( see , e.g. , sec . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it was suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite that topological charge changing transitions in qcd during heavy ion collisions may result in the appearance of metastable domains with @xmath2 and @xmath3 breaking with chirality induced in quark - gluon plasma by the axial anomaly .",
    "phenomenologically , to mimic the effect of topological charge changing transitions , it was proposed in @xcite to introduce a chiral chemical potential @xmath4 .",
    "this chemical potential couples to the difference between the number of left- and right - handed fermions and enters the lagrangian density through the term @xmath5 .",
    "this produces a chiral asymmetry and leads to a nondissipative electric current @xmath6 in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "first studies of interaction effects on the chiral asymmetry of relativistic matter in a magnetic field were done in refs .",
    "@xcite by using nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl)-like models with local interaction .",
    "in particular , by using the schwinger ",
    "dyson ( gap ) equation , it was found that the interaction unavoidably generates a chiral shift parameter @xmath7 @xcite when the fermion density is nonzero .",
    "this parameter enters the low - energy effective lagrangian density through the term @xmath8 and determines a relative shift of the momenta in the dispersion relations for opposite chirality fermions @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the longitudinal component of the momentum , directed along the magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the chiral shift @xmath7 is responsible for an additional contribution to the axial current .",
    "( note , however , that the dynamical generation of the chiral shift can not and does not modify the form of the chiral anomaly relation @xcite . )",
    "the chiral asymmetry for noninteracting fermions exists only in the lll . on the other hand",
    ", the chiral shift parameter found in refs .",
    "@xcite in the njl model is the same for all landau levels .",
    "this means that the whole fermi surfaces of the left- and right - handed fermions are shifted relative to each other by @xmath11 in the longitudinal direction in momentum space .",
    "such an unusual ground state closely resembles that in weyl semimetals in condensed matter physics @xcite , in which quasiparticles are described by the weyl equation .",
    "we should also mention that the absence of the chiral shift is not protected by any symmetry .",
    "the chiral shift breaks time reversal @xmath12 and the rotational symmetry @xmath13 to the @xmath14 symmetry of rotations about the axis set by the magnetic field .",
    "since these symmetries are explicitly broken in magnetized relativistic matter , it is natural to expect that the generation of chiral shift and chiral asymmetry in all landau levels is not a special property of the njl model , but a model - independent phenomenon .    in this connection , it is instructive to discuss the equation for @xmath7 in the perturbation theory in the njl model @xcite . in the first order in the coupling constant @xmath15 ,",
    "the value of @xmath7 is proportional to the axial current in the free theory @xcite , @xmath16 , which is completely defined by the topological contribution @xmath17 from the lll @xcite .",
    "therefore , the interaction causes the chiral asymmetry of the lll to propagate to higher landau levels including those around the whole fermi surface .",
    "it was found in refs .",
    "@xcite that the interactions in the njl model not only induce chiral asymmetry in the higher landau levels but also lead to the dynamical contribution of the higher levels to the axial current . in the recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the leading radiative corrections to the axial current were calculated in dense qed in a magnetic field .",
    "it was found that , like in the njl model , the axial current is not fixed by the chiral anomaly relation and thus does not coincide with the expression in the free theory , solely provided by the lll .",
    "instead , it receives nontrivial radiative corrections produced at all landau levels . because of that , it is natural to expect that , like in the njl model , the chiral asymmetry in qed will be induced by interactions in higher landau levels , too .",

    "this is in qualitative agreement with the finding in the njl model @xcite . in the case of qed with its long - range interaction , however , the chiral asymmetry of the fermi surfaces comes not only from the @xmath7 function , but also from the new function @xmath64 . also , unlike in the njl model , both of these functions have a nontrivial dependence on the particles momenta .",
    "in particular , they reveal a logarithmic enhancement of the asymmetry near the fermi surface .",
    "studying the fermion self - energy in dense qed in a magnetic field , we confirm , as suggested by the corresponding studies in the njl model @xcite , that nonzero radiative corrections to the axial current found in ref .",
    "@xcite are connected with the presence of chiral asymmetry in higher landau levels induced by interaction .",
    "our result for the fermion self - energy , obtained perturbatively in the coupling constant and in linear order in the external magnetic field , reveals the presence of two chirally asymmetric structures .",
    "one of them is the chiral shift function , analogous to the one previously obtained in the njl model .",
    "the other one is a new structure that resembles the chiral chemical potential .",
    "however , unlike the chiral chemical potential , it preserves parity because it is an odd function of the momentum directed along the magnetic field .",
    "note that this dependence on momentum is dictated by the parity symmetry .",
    "since qed in a magnetic field is invariant under parity and the self - energy is obtained in a perturbation theory , parity can not be broken .",
    "the term @xmath5 is not parity invariant unless @xmath4 is an odd function of momentum @xmath181 .",
    "the same argument also ensures that there is no electric current along the direction of the magnetic field , which would be present due to the chiral magnetic effect if one had @xmath182 .",
    "the current study of the chiral asymmetry in the ground state of a cold dense qed plasma is in qualitative agreement with the earlier study of the asymmetry in the njl model @xcite . in particular , the fermi surfaces of the left- and right - handed fermions are shifted relative to each other in momentum space in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the value of the shift appears to be rather large and , thus , may have important phenomenological implications .",
    "for example , a relativistic matter in stars , in which the chiral shift parameter is nonvanishing , will cause neutrinos to scatter off asymmetrically . as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , this can provide a new mechanism for the pulsar kicks .",
    "indeed , when the trapped neutrinos in a protoneutron star experience multiple elastic scattering on the chirally asymmetric state , they build up an anisotropic momentum distribution and , thus , provide a kick after leaving the star .    as should be clear from the physical meaning of the results obtained in this study , the chiral asymmetry in the ground state of the cold dense qed plasma is the main source of the radiative corrections to the axial current density calculated in ref .",
    "indeed , as the direct calculations show , the corresponding corrections originate from the perturbative self - energy contribution in the expansion of the fermion propagator .",
    "this observation is also consistent with the fact that the result for the axial current is particularly sensitive to the fermion states in the vicinity of the fermi surface , i.e. , the region of the phase space where the chiral asymmetry is most important .    in the future",
    ", it will be interesting to generalize the current study to the case of strong magnetic fields utilizing the expansion over landau levels and using numerical methods in calculations .",
    "in addition , the role of the photon screening effects should be understood in detail .",
    "it will be also interesting to clarify the connection between the chiral shift in relativistic systems in a magnetic field and a class of condensed matter systems with weyl quasiparticles , which reveal similar properties even in the absence of external fields @xcite .",
