    "multihop relay networks have received a lot of attention recently due to their ability to improve coverage and , thus , capacity in a geographical sense .",
    "many of these networks  such as mesh networks , vehicular networks , wireless sensor networks , and _ ad hoc _ networks  possess commonality insomuch as the number and distribution of nodes in the network is often random .",
    "a considerable amount of research on random networks has been conducted in the past ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . from a communications perspective , it is of paramount importance to understand the connectivity properties of such networks .",
    "this understanding can lead to improved protocols and network deployment methodologies in practice @xcite .    in recent years , researchers have adopted and adapted a number of techniques from the physics and mathematical communities to study connectivity in random networks . perhaps the most directly applicable theory that has been employed is that of continuum percolation @xcite , owing to its long and rich history of use in describing particle clustering in statistical physics and fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "in particular , percolation theory is concerned with the emergence of a single large connected component ( possibly in addition to other finite connected components ) in a large ( typically unbounded ) graph , and dictates the minimum node density  which is known as the _ critical node density _  required to obtain such a component .",
    "the links to network connectivity are obvious .",
    "percolation theory has been applied in recent years to identify and analyze power management techniques that can be used to ensure network connectivity @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to demonstrate the benefits that node cooperation gives to improving connectivity @xcite .",
    "further applications of the general theory of percolation ( including bond and site percolation ) can be found in studies of network resilience @xcite , hybrid networks ( i.e. , random networks with a regular element ) @xcite , coverage and connectivity in wireless sensor networks @xcite ( a direct application of @xcite ) , and the information theoretic capacity of networks @xcite .",
    "while the benefits of using percolation theory to explore asymptotic connectivity issues in random networks is clear , the theory does not directly address the question : what is the probability that _ all _ nodes in the network are connected ?",
    "this question falls under the heading of _ full connectivity _ rather than percolation .",
    "the answer to this question is , of course , related to a number of parameters , such as the fading environment , the path loss model , the node density , and the geometry in which the network resides .",
    "many researchers have studied full connectivity , typically in some asymptotic regime .",
    "two particular network models have been popularized for the study of full connectivity : the _ extended network model _ and the _ dense network model_. the former relates to the case where the node density is finite and the network area is large , whereas the latter specifies a finite network area with a high node density ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .    with regard to extended networks , in @xcite ,",
    "the authors assume a _ _ unit disk connection model _ _ , which is some fixed positive number . ] and give conditions on the path loss exponent for which full connectivity can be achieved in one - dimensional and two - dimensional networks . for dense networks ,",
    "a number of scaling laws have been published .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors derive a power scaling law that ensures full connectivity is achieved _ almost surely _ as the number of nodes in the network tends to infinity . in @xcite , scaling laws are given for the number of nearest neighbors ( i.e. , connections per node ) that are required to achieve full connectivity asymptotically in the number of nodes .",
    "related results are given in @xcite for sectorized networks .",
    "more practical connection models ( as opposed to the unit disk model ) have also been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "specifically , the authors of @xcite considered a probabilistic connection model whereby log - normal shadowing was incorporated into the path loss model . both 1-connectivity and",
    "@xmath0-connectivity - connected network is one that remains fully connected when @xmath1 point - to - point connections are broken . ]",
    "were considered in those papers . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered the effects of fast fading ( in particular , rayleigh and rician fading ) on full connectivity in dense networks , and derived expressions for the node isolation probability for several cases of interest .",
    "note that this probability effectively defines a first order approximation of the full - connectivity probability for dense networks , a point that we will elaborate upon later .",
    "finally , the authors of @xcite have recently studied connectivity with respect to the decay properties of a general _ pair - connectedness probability _ _",
    "the various contributions related to dense networks typically specify some geometry in which the network resides .",
    "these geometries are commonly taken to be squares or circles in two dimensions .",
    "one aspect that is common to virtually all of this research is that boundary effects are neglected in the interest of deriving a simple elegant result . _ in this paper , we show that such effects should not , in general , be neglected since they tend to dictate performance ( in terms of the full - connectivity probability ) in the high density limit for a qualitative illustration of this concept . ] .",
    "_ we provide a constructive explanation of this assertion through the application of a novel cluster expansion model , first developed in @xcite , which admits an accurate first order inhomogeneous approximation in the limit of large density .",
    "such models arise frequently in statistical physics to study the interaction between particles .",
    "the application of this approach to the problem of network connectivity carries many advantages , which together lead to the novel contributions of our work .",
    "these contributions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we utilize the inhomogeneous cluster expansion model to analyze the effects that boundaries have on connectivity for four important point - to - point link models : single - input single - output ( siso ) , single - input multiple - output ( simo ) , multiple - input single - output ( miso ) , and multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) . to facilitate this analysis ,",
    "we define the notion of the _ mass of connectivity _ , which is an average measure of pair connectedness in a given volume taking boundaries into account .",
    "2 .   we derive diversity and power scaling laws that dictate how boundary effects can be mitigated ( to leading order ) in confined dense networks .",
    "these laws are given for all four of the aforementioned point - to - point link models .",
    "we corroborate the general theory detailed in @xcite by analyzing boundary effects for dense networks comprising mimo point - to - point links confined within a right prism - sided polygon as its base , replicating it and translating it in the vertical  direction , then connecting the corresponding sides .",
    "thus , right prisms are representative of , for example , many room configurations in a building . ] .",
    "this example is both instructive and insightful , illustrating the versatility and advantages gained by employing the new cluster expansion theory in network analysis problems .",
    "[ ptb ]    ./surfaces_contours.jpg    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : pair_connectedness ] by giving some preliminary details , which include the point - to - point path loss model and pair - connectedness probabilities for siso , simo , miso , and mimo links . in section [ sec :",
    "connectivity ] , we give details of the cluster expansion model and derive diversity and power scaling laws for mitigating boundary effects to leading order .",
    "we then go one step further by analyzing the connectivity of a network confined in a right prism .",
    "analytical and numerical results for a specific right prism are given in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "finally , we draw some conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section , we provide preliminary details of the pair connectedness model that we adopt .",
    "specifically , we have that nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 are directly connected with probability @xmath4 , which we write as @xmath5 or just @xmath6 , where the distance function @xmath7 is non - negative , zero only when @xmath8 , and symmetric .",
    "we define the pair connectedness probability @xmath6 as the complement of the information outage probability between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this well - understood metric is a natural choice for pair connectedness since it provides fundamental insight into network connectivity behavior , and can even be transformed directly into a unit disk model through appropriate parameter definition if so desired ; however , it should also be noted that other pair connectedness models can easily be chosen , such as a model based on the average bit - error rate of a point - to - point link .",
    "the outage probability is generally parameterized by the received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , which in turn is a function of many system parameters as well as the path loss . consequently",
    ", we build our model of pair connectedness starting from a fundamental definition of the path loss model we employ .",
    "the received power of an electromagnetic wave decreases with distance like @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an environment - dependent decay parameter . typically , @xmath11 if propagation occurs in free space , with @xmath12 in cellular / cluttered environments or through walls ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it follows that the snr at the receiver ( assuming a fixed transmit power @xmath13 and a sufficiently narrow bandwidth ) also decays like @xmath9 .",
    "now , the outage probability for the link between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 is defined as the probability that the @xmath14 link can not support a given rate @xmath15 in bits per complex dimension , which can be written as@xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the random variable signifying the power of the channel between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the pair connectedness probability is simply @xmath18 , which , after some manipulation , yields@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the cummulative distribution function of @xmath17 , and @xmath21 is a constant  which depends on the frequency of the transmission , the power of the noise process at the receiver , and the transmit power  that defines the length scale .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath21 is inversely proportional to the average received snr . finally , we point out that by letting @xmath22 , we obtain the unit disk connection model:@xmath23{ll}1 , & r<1\\\\ 1-f_{x_{ij}}\\left (   \\beta\\right )   , & r=1\\\\ 0 , & r>1 \\end{array } \\right .   .\\",
    "] ]      we consider four general point - to - point link models : siso , simo , miso , and mimo links . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case where individual channel fading distributions follow a rayleigh model , and all channels are statistically independent .",
    "it follows that @xmath17 has a standard exponential distribution in the siso case and a chi - squared distribution with @xmath24 degrees of freedom in the simo / miso cases ( where @xmath25 is the number of diversity branches employed ) @xcite .",
    "thus , for siso links , we have@xmath26 and for simo / miso links , we have@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the upper incomplete gamma function . equation ( [ eq : hijsimo ] ) reduces to the siso case when @xmath29 .    for mimo links with @xmath30 transmit antennas and @xmath31 receive antennas , we are mostly concerned with ensuring connectivity is achieved .",
    "thus , we assume beamforming is applied at the transmitter of each node while maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) is employed at the receiver @xcite . for this so - called mimo mrc channel , the pair connectedness probability becomes@xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    ", @xmath36 is the lower incomplete gamma function , and@xmath37 in order to aid analysis , we will focus on the special case where @xmath38 .",
    "this restriction is justified on the basis of pragmatism : indeed , one would envisage that low complexity may be a requirement of nodes operating in dense networks .",
    "this is certainly the case in wireless sensor networks where sensors are often powered by batteries @xcite . in any case , we maintain some level of generality by not restricting @xmath39 . for @xmath38 and general @xmath39 , we can express @xmath6 as@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the regularized lower incomplete gamma function .",
    "we will use these formulae for @xmath6 in the next section to analyze the probability that a network is connected at the boundary of the confining geometry .",
    "in this section , we develop a novel theory of the probability of full network connectivity in confined geometries through the use of a cluster expansion technique .",
    "cluster expansions are frequently used in statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics to study the interaction between particles . in our application of network connectivity",
    ", we first give an overview of the model , then provide details of the first order expansion , which can be used to study connectivity in the high density limit for general pair - connectedness models . for more details on this model ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "we then utilize the pair - connectedness functions given in the previous section to analyze the probability of full connectivity at the boundary of the confining geometry to leading order , providing rules that dictate how diversity and power can be scaled to mitigate boundary effects .",
    "consider @xmath42 randomly distributed nodes with locations @xmath43 for @xmath44 according to a uniform density @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denotes the size of the set . here , we use the lebesgue measure of the appropriate dimension @xmath48 .",
    "we define the average of a quantity as@xmath49    we define some useful notation .",
    "let @xmath50 .",
    "a graph @xmath51 consists of a set @xmath52 of nodes , together with a collection @xmath53 of direct links , that is unordered distinct pairs of nodes . as a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "we write @xmath54 to denote that @xmath55 is an element of the set of links @xmath56 associated with the graph @xmath57 .",
    "we write @xmath58 for the set of graphs with nodes in @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for the set with nodes in @xmath59 and largest connected component ( cluster ) of size @xmath3 with @xmath61 .    the probability of two nodes being connected or not leads to the trivial identity@xmath62 multiplying over all links with nodes in a set @xmath59 expresses the probability of all possible combinations .",
    "this can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 the sum in ( [ eq : expansion ] ) contains @xmath65 separate terms .",
    "setting @xmath66 , this can be expressed as collections of terms determined by their largest cluster , which yields @xmath67    for a given configuration of node positions @xmath68 , assuming that the nodes are pairwise connected with independent probabilities @xmath6 , the first term in equation  ( [ eq : expansion2 ] ) is the probability of being fully connected @xmath69 .",
    "the average of this quantity over all possible configurations @xmath70 is the overall probability of obtaining a fully connected network and is our desired quantity of interest .",
    "hence , rearranging equation  ( [ eq : expansion2 ] ) allows us to obtain expressions for @xmath71 in a consistent way while keeping track of correction terms .",
    "note that in the high density limit of @xmath72 , the right hand side of ( [ eq : expansion2 ] ) is dominated by the first term , which yields @xmath73 , and hence the network is fully connected with probability one as expected .",
    "the approximation symbol is used here to indicate that first and higher order corrections are being ignored .",
    "the first order approximation is obtained by expanding the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : expansion2 ] ) explicitly , taking into account all possible ways of getting an @xmath74 cluster .",
    "thus the average probability that an @xmath42-node network confined in @xmath75 is fully connected ( to first order ) is @xmath76 where the simplification in the third equality is valid since all nodes are identical , meaning the sum over @xmath77 can be factored out .    at this point , we deviate from common practice and assume that the network is _ not _ translationally symmetric , _",
    "i.e. _ , the system is inhomongeneous .",
    "this ensures that we will include boundary effects in our analysis .",
    "indeed , it turns out that it is not only important to include such effects , but that they _",
    "dictate _ _ performance _ in the limit of high density .",
    "this is demonstrated to a large degree through the first order cluster expansion . in particular",
    ", we can progress from ( [ eq : pcaux ] ) to obtain@xmath78 in the limit of large @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , this equation was recently given in @xcite ( eq .",
    "( 8) ) , where @xmath79 was scaled exponentially with @xmath80 , which effectively implies boundary effects are ignored . for our approximation , however , we only require that @xmath81 , or equivalently @xmath82 ( cf .",
    "@xcite for more details on scaling limits of our theory ) .",
    "this is a key difference from previous approaches reported in the literature",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : pfc ] ) suggests that in the high density limit , the probability of having a single @xmath74 connected cluster ( _ i.e. _ , having an isolated node ) is dominated by nodes that are situated in hard to connect  regions of the available domain @xmath75 .",
    "this is because the outer integral in ( [ eq : pfc ] ) is dominated where the integral in the exponential is small , which occurs at corners , edges , and faces . for nodes located near these geometric effects ,",
    "the volume in range of the nodes is small .      taking a closer look at the integral in the exponent in ( [ eq : pfc ] )",
    ", we see that it effectively defines the _ mass of connectivity _ for a given pair - connectedness function at @xmath83 , and we label it accordingly:@xmath84 indeed , @xmath85 can be studied in detail for different pair - connectedness functions , and power and diversity scaling laws for bounded network connectivity can be gleaned from such an analysis . in the discussion that follows , it will be understood that @xmath85 is a function of @xmath83 , and thus we will refrain from explicitly writing out this relationship for the sake of brevity .",
    "we now incorporate the pair - connectedness functions given in section [ sec : pair_connectedness ] into the model .",
    "a common feature of these connection functions is that they decay exponentially with @xmath86 .",
    "this allows us to separate the @xmath87 integral in ( [ eq : pfc ] ) and extract its leading order behavior by supposing that @xmath83 is located somewhere on the boundary @xmath88 of the network domain @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "thus , for a general pair connectedness probability , we have to leading order@xmath90 where @xmath91 is the full solid angle in @xmath48 dimensions , @xmath92 is the solid angle as seen from @xmath83 , and we call @xmath93 the _ homogeneous mass of connectivity _ since it characterizes the mass of connectivity in a homogeneous system . note that the domain of integration in the @xmath94 integral is not truncated from above because the integrand is exponentially decaying and , thus , does not contribute significantly to the integral for large arguments ( _ i.e. _ , for nodes located far from the node at @xmath83 ) .",
    "this approximation clearly demonstrates the influence that boundaries have on connectivity .",
    "specifically , by writing@xmath95 where @xmath96 , we see that connectivity is dominated from regions that are hard to connect and is controlled by the solid angle available to them .",
    "however , we can not ignore the contribution of @xmath93 , which will be seen to be useful in determining ways to mitigate a small solid angle contribution .",
    "we now investigate the leading order behavior for the four link models detailed in section [ sec : pair_connectedness ] , placing particular emphasis on how diversity and power control can be used to mitigate boundary effects .",
    "note that in order for us to obtain a more detailed view of boundary effects , we must expand ( [ eq : boundary_integral ] ) beyond leading order ; a discussion to this effect is given in section [ sec : prisms ] .      for siso , simo , and miso pair connectedness ,",
    "we have@xmath97 the @xmath94 integral can be calculated directly by using the standard integral definition of the incomplete gamma function@xmath98 and exchanging the order of integration , which eventually yields@xmath99 for uncluttered ( @xmath11 ) @xmath48-dimensional networks with point - to - point siso links , @xmath29 and we have the simple result@xmath100    intuitively , one might expect that boundary effects can be mitigated somewhat through the use of diversity ( dictated by @xmath25 in this case ) . expanding ( [ eq : leading_order_simo ] ) to leading order as @xmath25 grows large yields@xmath101 thus , we see that although an increase in @xmath25 results in better connectivity , the rate of increase is highly dependent upon the dimension of the space in which the network resides and the path loss exponent .",
    "indeed , by scaling @xmath25 , it is possible to obtain a progressive improvement in performance in uncluttered environments ( @xmath102 ) , whereas cluttered environments ( @xmath103 ) will typically yield diminishing returns . to illustrate this scaling law ,",
    "we have plotted the exact expression for @xmath93 along with the leading order term in fig .",
    "[ fig : simo ] . not only is the leading order behavior apparent in this example , but we see that the leading order , in fact , provides an excellent approximation .",
    "[ ptb ]    ./simo.jpg    as a final note , recall that @xmath21 is inversely proportional to the average received snr at a given node .",
    "consequently , it can be seen from ( [ eq : leading_order_simo ] ) that an increase in the transmit power for each node has the same scaling effect as an increase in the diversity order @xmath25 .",
    "however , it should be noted that this analysis is only valid when such an increase is less than exponential relative to the system size , _",
    "i.e. _ , scaling the transmit power must not counteract the exponential decay in pair connectedness .",
    "the fact that boundary effects can be somewhat mitigated through the appropriate use of diversity and/or power scaling is a powerful conclusion with significant practical implications , particularly since these scaling laws have identical order .",
    "for example , some networks may be energy / power constrained ( _ e.g. _ , wireless sensor networks and cognitive networks ) whereas others may be constrained by form size ( _ e.g. _ , some vehicular networks ) .",
    "the scaling laws presented here provide engineering insight into how to design networks for a plethora of scenarios .",
    "we can perform the same analysis for mimo systems . in this case",
    ", we restrict our attention to systems where @xmath38 , for which @xmath6 can be rewritten from ( [ eq : hijmimom2 ] ) into the form@xmath104 using this form of @xmath6 , we can evaluate @xmath93 by integrating term by term and using recurrence relations of hypergeometric functions to yield@xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the hypergeometric function .",
    "the terms involving hypergeometric functions result from integrating the quadratic terms in the expression for @xmath6 given above . again",
    ", the effect of the solid angle defining the volume in range is apparent .",
    "although the expression given above is quite cumbersome and does not necessarily lead to much intuitive insight , we can easily evaluate the approximation for specific values of @xmath39 .",
    "for example , we have for @xmath107@xmath108    on the other hand , we can obtain a scaling law in @xmath39 by noting that for large @xmath39 , the contributions of the @xmath109-functions in ( [ eq : hijmimom2 ] ) are not significant for @xmath110 . moreover , for @xmath111 , @xmath112 decays exponentially .",
    "thus , we can approximate @xmath112 by a step function with a transition at @xmath113 .",
    "we present an argument for making this approximation in appendix [ app : stepfunctionapprox ] .",
    "it follows that we can write @xmath114 where the error term is given by@xmath115 note that @xmath116 corresponds to the negative contribution and @xmath117 is the positive contribution .",
    "it remains to determine the order ( in @xmath39 ) of the error term .",
    "in fact , it can be shown ( by way of accurate approximation if not rigorously ) that@xmath118 a derivation of this result is given in appendix [ app : errorterm ] .",
    "thus , we can write@xmath119 which is completely analogous to the simo / miso case .",
    "this scaling law is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mimo ] , where we have plotted the exact expression for @xmath93 given by ( [ eq : leading_order_mimo2 ] ) along with the leading order term .",
    "the leading order growth in @xmath39 is apparent in this example , but in contrast to the simo / miso case , it is not a good approximation .",
    "this results from the fact that the first correction term is @xmath120 rather than @xmath121 as is the case in simo / miso systems .",
    "finally , it is easy to see ( by observing ( [ eq : leading_order_mimo2 ] ) ) that the same transmit power scaling law holds , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath93 scales like @xmath122 .",
    "[ ptb ]    ./mimo.jpg",
    "in @xcite , we developed a general formula for studying the full - connectivity probability in the limit of high density for any network domain .",
    "this formula takes the form@xmath123 where , again , @xmath48 is the dimension , @xmath124 is a geometrical factor for each object @xmath125 of codimension @xmath2 , and @xmath126 is the corresponding @xmath127 dimensional volume of the object with solid angle @xmath128 . in the spirit of this formula",
    ", we now derive an expression for @xmath71 by evaluating ( [ eq : pfc ] ) when the network in question is located in a right prism and the point - to - point links are modeled as uncluttered ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath11 ) @xmath129 mimo channels .",
    "the choice of mimo point - to - point links for this analysis was taken to demonstrate that our methodology can be applied to reasonably complicated scenarios .",
    "indeed , siso , simo and miso links can also be analyzed .",
    "the pair connectedness probability for @xmath129 mimo channels with @xmath11 simplifies to@xmath130 where @xmath86 is the distance between two nodes . to derive @xmath71 in the form of ( [ eq : general_formula ] )",
    ", we evaluate the integral ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : pfc]))@xmath131 for each local feature of the geometry is dependent upon @xmath83 since we will be concerned with first order correction terms . ] .",
    "this illustrative example will further show how geometric effects influence connectivity .",
    "moreover , the choice of a right prism as the confining geometry demonstrates the power and versatility of our theory , particularly since many practical geometries can be well approximated by such a polyhedron .    at this point",
    ", it is beneficial and instructive to give an outline of the approach we use to analyze networks confined in right prisms .",
    "our general method is to begin by considering features with the lowest dimension , _",
    "i.e. _ , corners in this case .",
    "we then move to edges , then faces , and finally the bulk of the prism . at each step , we ignore objects of lower dimension since we have accounted for their contribution to connectivity in previous steps .",
    "it will be observed that this is a particularly powerful approach when analyzing the effects that the bulk and faces have since the surface ( volume ) of a right prism is locally equivalent to that of a sphere of the appropriate surface area ( volume ) .",
    "we now give details of our analysis , and follow this discussion with a specific example .      for a right prism ,",
    "each corner is the product of three intersecting planes that can be oriented such that at least one edge connected to its vertex is normal to an adjoining face .",
    "this suggests that we should use cylindrical coordinates to perform calculations for this case , where we locate the origin at the vertex and the @xmath132-axis is oriented along the edge that connects the two identical polygons .",
    "the distance between two points in cylindrical coordinates is given by@xmath133 where @xmath134 are the coordinates of a node located at @xmath135 .",
    "thus , in order to evaluate the inner integral of ( [ eq : integral_for_prism ] ) near the corner , we let @xmath83 be located near the corner and expand @xmath136 near @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which , to first order , yields@xmath139 we can now perform the inner integrals in ( [ eq : integral_for_prism ] ) as follows:@xmath140 where @xmath141 is the angle of the corner with @xmath142 .",
    "note that semi - infinite integration is allowed here due to the fact that @xmath143 is exponentially decreasing but the system size is large denotes the typical length of the geometry , then we require @xmath144 . ] .",
    "thus , contributions to the integral at distant boundaries are negligible . using ( [ eq : inner_integral_corner ] ) , we are now in a position to calculate the outer integrals of ( [ eq : integral_for_prism ] ) , which yields@xmath145 the regions of integration are the same here as for the inner integrals ; however , note that the order of integration changes .",
    "all that remains is to enumerate the @xmath146 corners for a prism constructed from an @xmath39-sided polygon .",
    "each corner is defined by the angle @xmath141 .",
    "for example , a cuboid , which is a right prism formed by replicating and translating a square , has eight corners , all of which have angle @xmath147 .",
    "now we consider geometric features of dimension one : edges .",
    "let @xmath56 be the length of the edge in question .",
    "the calculations for this case are also facilitated by the use of cylindrical coordinates , but where the origin is located at the center of the edge .",
    "thus , the corners are located at @xmath148 and the angle of the corner is @xmath141 .",
    "since we wish to ignore effects from corners , faces , and the bulk , we expand @xmath143 about @xmath137 and @xmath149 , which gives ( [ eq : h_expanded_0 ] ) . calculating the inner integrals in ( [ eq : integral_for_prism ] )",
    "to first order yields an expression that has @xmath150 and @xmath151 terms .",
    "again , assuming that @xmath144 , we can make the approximations @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "it follows that @xmath154 can be evaluated to yield@xmath155 where the integrals are performed over @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 .",
    "the outer integrals in ( [ eq : integral_for_prism ] ) can now be performed to yield@xmath159 again , all that remains is to enumerate the @xmath160 edges .      for the contribution of the faces to the full - connectivity probability ,",
    "we employ a _ local equivalence _ argument that allows us to greatly simplify the analysis .",
    "specifically , we have covered the corner and edge calculations above , and thus we ignore contributions from these features when considering faces .",
    "thus , one can imagine deforming a prism of surface area @xmath161 into a sphere of the same surface area , the radius @xmath162 of which is defined by the relation @xmath163 . for a general right prism , the surface area",
    "is given by@xmath164 where @xmath165 is the area of the base ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath39-sided polygon ) , @xmath166 is the base perimeter , and @xmath167 is the height . if the base is a regular @xmath39-sided polygon with side length @xmath168 , we have@xmath169 thus , this argument allows us to treat any convex right prism that we wish .    using spherical coordinates along with the fact that the distance between nodes at @xmath170 and @xmath83 is given by@xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173   $ ] is the angle between the nodes , we expand @xmath143 near the surface of the sphere ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath174 ) and perform the inner integrals in ( [ eq : integral_for_prism ] ) to obtain@xmath175 where the factor of @xmath176 follows from integration over the azimuthal angle .",
    "to arrive at this result , it was assumed that @xmath177 , which allows us to make similar approximations to the error functions of the form @xmath178 and exponentials of the form @xmath179 for some constant @xmath180 as was done for edges .",
    "furthermore , we have made the additional approximations @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the outer integrals can now be performed to yield ( to dominant term in @xmath162 and @xmath80)@xmath183 generalizing this result to any right prism , _",
    "i.e. _ , substituting @xmath184 , gives@xmath185 the faces do not need to be enumerated in this case since we have accounted for all faces through the local equivalence argument .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that face contributions can also be calculated in a lengthy manner by using cartesian coordinates .",
    "this works well for rectangular sides ; however , one must be more careful when considering more general @xmath39-sided polygons . in any case",
    ", it is straightforward to show for certain simple cases that the proposed approach to the calculation yields identical results to the more complex cartesian approach .      for the bulk contribution",
    ", we apply the same local equivalence argument that was used for the face contributions , but where the expansion in @xmath143 is performed at @xmath137 .",
    "in other words , we consider a sphere of radius @xmath162 determined by the relation @xmath186 , where@xmath187 is the volume of the right prism containing the network . for a prism constructed from a base that is a regular @xmath39-sided polygon with side length @xmath168 , we have@xmath188    expanding @xmath143 about the origin to first order , we can perform the inner integration to obtain@xmath189 finally",
    ", the outer integrals can be evaluated to yield@xmath190      we now apply the calculations detailed above to a particular scenario .",
    "specifically , we consider a network comprised of @xmath129 mimo links with @xmath11 operating in a right prism that resembles a typical house , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : house ] .",
    "the base of the house is a square of side @xmath56 .",
    "the total height of the prism is @xmath191 , and the apex is right angled .",
    "this example somewhat illustrates the versatility of our theory , particularly since most previously published results have considered very simple geometries , such as squares and circles in two dimensions , or cubes and spheres in three dimensions .",
    "it should be noted that this is an arbitrary example , and in fact many more complicated geometries can be analyzed with the proposed methodology .",
    "[ ptb ]    ./house3d.jpg    analysis of the house  prism is straightforward using the calculations given in the preceding sections .",
    "we first identify the different corner angles and count the multiplicities of each .",
    "there are ten corners in this prism , six of which have angle @xmath147 and four of which have angle @xmath192 .",
    "thus , the following two contributions to the general formula for @xmath71 arise from the corners ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : corner])):@xmath193 and@xmath194    next , we perform a similar step for the edges , of which there are fifteen .",
    "thirteen edges are right angled : nine of these have length @xmath56 while the remaining four have length @xmath195 .",
    "the other two edges have angle @xmath192 and length @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we can write the following two edge contributions to the high density expression for @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : edges])):@xmath196 and@xmath197    for the faces of the prism , we calculate the total surface area to be@xmath198 thus , using the local equivalence argument presented above , we can substitute this area into ( [ eq : surfaces ] ) to obtain the contribution of all of the faces to @xmath71 .",
    "we denote this contribution as @xmath199 .",
    "similarly , we can take the volume of the prism to be@xmath200 substituting into ( [ eq : volume ] ) yields the bulk contribution to @xmath71 , which we denote by @xmath201 .",
    "finally , the general formula is obtained through the summation of all contributions , which yields@xmath202 it can easily be seen that this formula has the same structure as ( [ eq : general_formula ] ) .",
    "in fact , the various contributions to the general formula are outlined in table [ tab:1 ] .",

[ fig : pfc ] . furthermore , to illustrate the accuracy of our results at high density , we have plotted the probability of network outage ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath210 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : pout ] . in these figures , the two solid curves ( reading left to right in both figures ) are the numerical and full analytical results ( including contributions from all geometrical boundary features ) .",
    "note that good agreement is achieved at high densities as expected .",
    "the left - most dashed curve ( red ) is the general formula with only a bulk term ( _ i.e. _ , all boundaries are ignored ) .",
    "this curve representes conventional wisdom , where boundary effects are neglected , and serves as a benchmark for our results .",
    "this benchmark is overly optimistic and should be treated with caution .",
    "this is particularly clear in fig .",
    "[ fig : pout ] .",
    "the next dashed curve ( yellow ) includes bulk and face contributions .",
    "we see that by including even two - dimensional boundary effects , the model is improved significantly .",
    "the right - most dashed curve ( green ) includes bulk , face , and edge contributions , but not corners .",
    "[ ptb ]    ./pfc.jpg    [ ptb ]    ./pout.jpg    although these results show that our theory is in excellent agreement with simulations for high densities , they also illustrate the limitations of the theory for low to mid - range densities .",
    "however , one notices that , for example , boundaries are not as significant at low densities .",
    "moreover , for mid - range densities , one may only need to consider boundary effects due to faces and/or edges , but not corners , in order to obtain accurate connectivity predictions .",
    "this observation can be explained in , perhaps , two ways .",
    "firstly , from a mathematical point of view , our analysis relied heavily on expansions , both near boundaries and at high density . to maintain simplicity and tractability , these expansions were typically only to first order .",
    "this may be a limitation when considering low to mid - range densities .",
    "secondly , one may intuitively expect that away from the region of high density there is a low probability of a node being located _ very _ close to a boundary , which of course is where our analysis is valid ( again , expansions were taken near boundaries ) . in any case , our results actually suggest that the theory can be modified somewhat to be valid in regions of low and mid - range densities .",
    "this is certainly of interest , and is currently ongoing work .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the probability of full connectivity for dense networks confined within certain geometries .",
    "in contrast to much of the results reported in the literature , we showed that boundary effects should not be ignored , and in fact dictate performance in the high density regime .",
    "we built upon our cluster expansion model of full network connectivity , first reported in @xcite , by adopting four important point - to - point link models for pair connectedness : siso , simo , miso , and mimo .",
    "this approach allowed us to study the effects that the boundaries of the confining geometry have on practical network connectivity , and led to the derivation of diversity and power scaling laws that dictate how these effects can be mitigated .",
    "finally , we provided a practical example by analyzing the full - connectivity probability of a network comprising mimo point - to - point links confined within a right prism .",
    "this example demonstrated the versatility of our theory in network analysis problems , and we hope that this theory will inspire many researchers in their own problems related to network design and performance analysis .",
