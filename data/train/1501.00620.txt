    "device - to - device ( d2d ) communications @xcite have emerged as a promising paradigm for 3gpp lte - advanced ( lte - a ) networks , which provide mobile wireless connectivity , reconfigurable architectures , as well as various wireless applications ( e.g. , network gaming , social content sharing and vehicular networking ) for better user experience . with d2d communications , nearby devices in a cellular network",
    "can communicate with each other directly bypassing the base stations .",
    "conventional d2d communications commonly refer to direct information exchanges among devices in human - to - human and machine - to - machine communications , without the involvement of wireless operators .",
    "however , conventional d2d technologies can not provide efficient interference management , security control and quality - of - service guarantee @xcite .",
    "recently , there is a trend towards operator - controlled d2d communications to facilitate profit making for operators as well as better user experience for devices @xcite .",
    "this paper considers a multi - hop lte - a network consists of devices deployed by multiple operators . in this network , an efficient approach to improve the end - to - end throughput",
    "is to enable cooperative sharing of idle devices among the operators for multi - path routing @xcite .",
    "the cooperation can increase throughput for the devices because a cooperative relay may substantially lead to improved network capacity .",
    "accordingly , a larger amount of user traffic demand can be supported , which will lead to higher aggregated revenue for operators . in this cooperation",
    ", each operator needs to decide on which operators to cooperate with to maximize profit and , given the cooperation behavior of operators .",
    "then , the devices from cooperative operators need to make decision on which devices to cooperate with to maximize throughput .",
    "we call the formation of this interrelated operator cooperation and device cooperation as a hierarchical cooperation problem , which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "the hierarchical cooperation gives rise to two major concerns .",
    "firstly , what is the stable coalitional structure desirable for all operators so that none of operators is willing to leave the coalition ? secondly , what is the stable network structure for cooperative devices to perform multi - path routing ?",
    "this paper addresses these two concerns by formulating a layered game framework to model the lte - a network with operators and devices being the players in the upper and lower layer , respectively .",
    "previous work has also considered game - theoretic framework with hierarchies / layers , e.g. , @xcite in the cognitive radio networks , @xcite in two - tier femtocell networks and @xcite in wrns .",
    "however , most of the works considered the competition relationship between different layers , which belongs to the stackelberg game concept @xcite . in the proposed layered game framework , different layers interact to improve the benefit of each other cooperatively .",
    "we adopt the concepts of an extended recursive core and nash network as the solutions for the proposed games in the upper layer and lower layer , respective . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work to introduce the application of extended recursive core in wireless communications .",
    "we consider an lte - a network consisting of a number of devices belonging to multiple operators .",
    "we denote the set of operators as @xmath0 , and the set of devices of operator @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "the operators are willing to form overlapping coalitions to maximize their individual profits .",
    "an overlapping coalitional structure for a number of operators can be defined in a cover function as the set @xmath3 which is a collection of non - empty subsets of @xmath4 such that @xmath5 and the sub - coalitions could overlap with each other .",
    "@xmath6 is the total number of coalitions in collection @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the set of coalitions that operator @xmath9 belongs to .    for multiple access at every hop",
    ", we consider an ofdma - based transmission . in an operator coalition @xmath10 , each relay device @xmath11 not only needs to support internal flow transmission demand , but also can serve as a relay for other devices from cooperative operators @xmath12 . due to the limited transmission power of each device , multi - hop relaying is adopted to route flow sessions from source devices to destination devices .",
    "since single path routing is too restrictive for satisfying traffic demand , we assume each flow session can be split for multi - path routing if necessary .",
    "figure [ model ] illustrates an example for the studied system model and the corresponding notations . in this example",
    ", the lte - a network is composed of @xmath13 devices deployed by @xmath14 different operators , i.e. , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . from fig .",
    "[ model ] , there is a multi - path flow sourced from @xmath19 to @xmath20 and a single - path flow sourced from @xmath21 to @xmath22 . from the chosen links , the final coalitional structure of the operators is @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the set of flow sessions from operator @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath25 denote the set of nodes of flow @xmath26 .",
    "the source and destination device of flow @xmath26 is represented as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "we denote the link between two devices @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath31",

    "@xmath36 denotes the data rate on link @xmath37 attributed to a flow session @xmath38 .",
    "since , for d2d communications , a flow session from a source device may traverse multiple relay devices to reach its destination device , we consider the following two cases about a device .",

    "the aggregated data rate on each link @xmath31 can not exceed the link s capacity . thus we have the following constraint , @xmath49    let @xmath50 denote the maximal rate a flow session @xmath26 that is available on link @xmath37 , with the constraints in ( [ source ] ) , ( [ intermediate ] ) and ( [ rate ] ) , and @xmath51 the maximal aggregated rate of a flow session @xmath26 .",
    "we have @xmath52 .",
    "the aggregated rate of flow session @xmath53 is constrained by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the rate demand of flow session @xmath26 .",
    "we formulate a game - theoretic framework , referred to as the layered coalitional game ( lcg ) , to model the decision - making process of hierarchical cooperation between the operators and devices .",
    "both operators and devices are assumed to be self - interested and rational .",
    "the operators aim to maximize their individual utility , while the devices attempt to maximize their end - to - end throughput with the help of relay devices from cooperative operators . in this lcg ,",
    "the operators need to decide on the coalitional structure and the devices need to make decisions to form a relay network structure , both in distributed ways , with the aim to improve their utilities and payoffs respectively . as both operators and devices only have limited information at their own layer , information exchange between both layers is required .",
    "the operators need to collect the payoff information from devices , to make the decision of coalitional structure formation .",
    "the decision of operators will then be provided to the devices for the purpose of network structure formation . in this regard , there could be multiple interactions between the operator layer and device layer . recognizing the behavior of operators and devices , we propose to use the overlapping coalition formation game ( cfg ) to model the behavior of operators and the coalitional graphical game ( cgg ) to characterize the interaction among devices , which will be introduced in section iii - b and section iii - c , respectively .",
    "since operators and devices have different objectives and concerns during the cooperation , our next step is to define the objective functions to capture the incentives for operators and devices . for a given operator coalition @xmath56",
    ", we define the payoff of a device @xmath57 from operator @xmath58 , which performs flow transmission , as the end - to - end throughput of the flow from device @xmath29 to device @xmath59 , which is expressed as follows ,    @xmath60    where @xmath61 .",
    "a relay device @xmath30 aims to help a device @xmath29 on transmission to improve the throughput by most .",
    "therefore , to evaluate how much the relay device @xmath30 can help to improve the throughput of the device @xmath29 , we define the payoff of the relay device @xmath30 as the difference between the throughput of the device @xmath29 with the help of device @xmath30 and that without the help of device @xmath30 , which can be expressed as follows :    [ rdevice ] v(\\{j } ) & = v^(j)(\\{i})-v^(/j)(\\{i } ) + & = _ _ h _ h _",
    "l^(h ) ^h ^i = n(l^(h ) ) _ j _ i \\{j } f_(i , j)(l^(h ) ) + & - _ _ h _ h _",
    "l^(h ) ^h ^i = n(l^(h))_j^ _ i f_(i , j)(l^(h ) )    @xmath62    where @xmath63 represents the payoff of device",
    "@xmath29 with the help of device @xmath30 and @xmath64 represents the payoff of device @xmath29 without the help of device @xmath59 . in the proposed lcg , operators are allowed to form overlapping coalitions to share their idle devices as relays with the aim to improve the aggregated throughput .    through multi - path routing , each operator aims to improve the aggregated throughput as much as possible .",
    "thus , in return , higher revenue for providing the flow to meet the customer demand will be rewarded for each operator .",
    "we define the individual utility of the operator as the profit , i.e. , revenue minus the cost of devices in transmitting and forwarding a packet ( e.g. , due to energy consumption ) .",
    "let @xmath65 denote the rewarded revenue per unit throughput achieved per unit time , and @xmath66 denote the operation cost per device @xmath29 per unit time . in this case , we assume @xmath67 .",
    "then , given a partition @xmath68 , for an operator @xmath9 without cooperation , i.e. , @xmath69 , the utility function @xmath70 can be calculated as ( [ operator ] ) , @xmath71 the first term and the second term on the right side of ( [ operator ] ) represents the aggregated revenue for operator @xmath9 and the total device costs , respectively .    while cooperation can lead to profit improvement for operators , it may also incur inherent coordination costs , such as packet overhead .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the coalition cost incurs to operator @xmath9 for being coaliton @xmath56 .",
    "the objective for operator cooperation through cooperative sharing of devices , is to maximize their aggregated profit , i.e. , revenue is subtracted by device operation cost and coalition cost . given the partition @xmath7",
    ", we define the utility of an operator coalition @xmath73 as the profit of the coalition as follows , @xmath74      an overlapping cfg is formulated among operators whose interests are to satisfy its internal flows with as less cost as possible . due to interference ,",
    "the utility of any operator is affected by not only the behavior of others in the same coalition , but also that of operators from other coalitions .",
    "thus , the considered operator coalitional game is in a partition form since the aggregated utility of a coalition @xmath73 depends on the coalitional structure @xmath7 of all the operators @xmath4 in the network .",
    "we introduce the framework of an overlapping cfg in partition form with non - transferable utility to model the cooperation among operators .",
    "an overlapping cfg in partition form with non - transferable utility ( ntu ) is defined by a pair @xmath75 where @xmath4 is the set of players , and @xmath76 is a value function that maps every partition @xmath7 and every coalition @xmath77 to a real number that represents the total utility ( profit ) that players in coalition @xmath56 can obtain .",
    "the _ strategy _ of an operator is to form the coalitions to improve its individual utility defined by ( [ operator ] ) .",
    "note that different from non - overlapping cfg where players have to cooperate with all others in the same coalition and each player only stays in one coalition , in an overlapping cfg , each player is able to join multiple different coalitions .",
    "the solution of the overlapping cfg is the stable overlapping coalitional structure for operators , under which no one will deviate .",
    "to this end , we adopt the concept of _ extended recursive core _",
    "@xcite , referred to as @xmath78 , as the solution .",
    "@xmath78 is an extended solution of coalition formation game , which allows coalitions to overlap , accounting for externalities across coalitions . in the proposed game ,",
    "the externalities are represented by the inter - coalition interference between devices .",
    "deviation is a key notion for the definition of the @xmath78 . as a consequence of deviation",
    ", a new partition will be formed .",
    "therefore , the deviation is equivalent to the formation of a new partition . in the proposed operator coalitional game ,",

    "if a coalition of players performs a complete deviation or partial deviation , this may affect the payoffs of the remaining players .",
    "for the remaining players , we then define the _ residual game _ as following :    let @xmath90 be an overlapping cfg in partition form . if a subset of players @xmath56 has already organized themselves into a certain partition @xmath91 .",

    "<S> device - to - device ( d2d ) communications , which allow direct communication among mobile devices , have been proposed as an enabler of local services in 3gpp lte - advanced ( lte - a ) cellular networks . </S>",
    "<S> this work investigates a hierarchical lte - a network framework consisting of multiple d2d operators at the upper layer and a group of devices at the lower layer . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a cooperative model that allows the operators to improve their utility in terms of revenue by sharing their devices , and the devices to improve their payoff in terms of end - to - end throughput by collaboratively performing multi - path routing . to help understanding the interaction among operators and devices , we present a game - theoretic framework to model the cooperation behavior , and further </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a layered coalitional game ( lcg ) to address the decision making problems among them . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the cooperation of operators is modeled as an overlapping coalition formation game ( cfg ) in a partition form , in which operators should form a stable coalitional structure . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the cooperation of devices is modeled as a coalitional graphical game ( cgg ) , in which devices establish links among each other to form a stable network structure for multi - path routing . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the extended recursive core , and nash network , as the stability concept for the proposed cfg and cgg , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results demonstrate that the proposed lcg yields notable gains compared to both the non - cooperative case and a lcg variant and achieves good convergence speed .    _ </S>",
