    "high - mass stars ( m@xmath14m@xmath9 ) are predominantly observed in young ( @xmath15myr ) , massive clusters ( m@xmath16m@xmath9 ) located within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) . despite their rarity and short life times , high - mass stars are responsible for injecting a significant amount of energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) by means of stellar winds , ionising radiation and supernovae .",
    "the impact of such feedback mechanisms from high - mass stars on the ism and star formation is still a topic of debate but is thought to play an important role in driving the evolution of gmcs .",
    "feedback can be both constructive and destructive by sweeping up and clearing out parsec - scale cavities ( or bubbles ) in the ism @xcite resulting in dense gas shells or destroying and dispersing the molecular environment .",
    "this means that feedback from high - mass stars should have the potential to both inhibit or enhance subsequent star formation and profoundly influence the star formation history ( sfh ) of gmcs @xcite .",
    "the g305 gmc complex is located within the scutum - crux arm of the milky way at @xmath17 , @xmath18 at a distance of @xmath19kpc and is one of the most massive and luminous star - forming regions in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the g305 complex consists of a number of molecular clouds that surround a cavity centered on the open clusters danks1 and 2 ( fig .",
    "[ im : obsmopra ] , triangles ) and the wolf rayet star wr48a . the feedback from the high - mass stars in and around danks1 and 2 appears to be responsible for driving the expansion of a large ( @xmath20pc ) cavity into the surrounding molecular gas .",
    "previous observations of g305 , summarised by @xcite , have revealed the presence of ongoing star formation surrounding the central cavity ( see fig.2 in @xcite ) , which suggests that the overall morphology of the complex is consistent with numerous sites of ongoing high - mass star formation that may have been triggered by interaction between the winds and ionising radiation of danks1 and 2 and the natal molecular clouds .",
    "these conditions make g305 an excellent laboratory in which to study high - mass star formation and the impact of feedback from high - mass stars on the evolution of gmcs .    in this work we present single dish observations of @xmath0co , @xmath1co  and c@xmath2o  in the rotational transition to explore the global distribution and properties of molecular gas in g305 .",
    "co is the most abundant molecule in the ism , after h@xmath3 , and the low - energy rotational transition is an excellent tracer of the cool ( @xmath21k ) low density gas ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) within molecular clouds @xcite . to explore the ionised environment we present wide - area interferometric observations of the large - scale 5.5 and 8.8ghz radio continuum which is generated by the thermal bremsstrahlung mechanism in the ionised gas that surrounds high - mass stars .",
    "previous observations of the radio continuum emission towards g305 have been limited to low resolution ( 45 ) single dish observations @xcite that are unable to resolve the radio substructure on the scale of compact hii regions .",
    "higher resolution ( 1 - 20 ) interferometric radio continuum observations exist but suffer from low sensitivity and significant spatial filtering @xcite and so are unable to identify extended features .",
    "the data set presented in the following section allows the investigation of the molecular environment in which high - mass star formation is ongoing and allows us to trace the distribution and investigate the impact of ionising radiation from high - mass stars . by searching the literature for tracers of ongoing star formation ,",
    "we are able to investigate the relationship between the ionised and molecular environment with star formation and thus broadly trace the sfh of the region .",
    "this paper is organised as follows ; in section  [ sect : obs ] we present the observations , data reduction and ancillary data utilised in this study , section  [ sect : results ] presents the results and analysis of the molecular and ionised observations , in section  [ sect : discussion ] we present our discussion of the results including the relationship between the ionised and molecular gas and star formation , the role of triggering and sfh of the region .",
    "we end this paper with a summary in section  [ sect : summary ] .",
    "co observations of the g305 complex were obtained during two observing runs in september of 2010 and 2011 using the 3 mm receiver on the mopra 22-m millimetre - wave telescope operated by the australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) .",
    "the back end of mopra is the university of new south wales mopra spectrometer ( mops ) which consists of four 2.2ghz bands that overlap to provide 8ghz of continuous bandwidth .",
    "the narrow or `` zoom '' mode of mops was used which allows 16 intermediate frequencies ( ifs ) to be observed simultaneously .",
    "each of the 16 zoom `` windows '' has a bandwidth of 137.5mhz over 4096 channels giving a velocity resolution at 110ghz of @xmath24kms@xmath13  per channel .",
    "the velocities presented in this work are in the kinematic local standard of rest ( lsr ) frame centred on @xmath25kms@xmath13 , the systematic velocity of g305 @xcite .",
    "we centred the 8ghz band at 112ghz and placed the zoom windows of mops to cover three co isotopologues ; @xmath0co , @xmath1co  and c@xmath2o  in the rotational transition ( table  [ tab : mopslines2 ] ) . the remaining zoom windows were set to the rest frequency of lines of interest such as hc@xmath26n ( ) , ch@xmath26cn ( ) and c@xmath27o ( ) but no emission @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the rms background noise , was detected ."
