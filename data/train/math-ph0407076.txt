    "one of the distinct features of crystalline structures is that they are characterized by discrete parameters , in addition to continuous ones .",
    "examples of such discrete parameters are lattice symmetry classes , numbers of atoms in the unit cell , occupancies of wyckoff positions etc .",
    "taking into account the role of discrete parameters in our understanding of the structure , it is appealing to find similar parameters for quasicrystals .",
    "certain of them could be obtained as a generalization of the discrete parameters specific for crystals in the framework of the `` cut - and - project '' model .",
    "this is the case e.g. for the symmetry class of the underlying high - dimensional lattice @xcite or for the number of atoms in the unit cell ( which is replaced by the homology class of the atomic surface @xcite ) .",
    "the efforts to develop a more systematic approach to the problem have lead to a promising concept of mutual local derivability ( mld ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as for now there is little progress in systematic classification of distinct mld classes .",
    "an alternative approach to classification of quasicrystals is based on the notion of the _ hull _ of a quasiperiodic structure .",
    "the concept of hull originated from the works by bellissard @xcite on @xmath3 of observables in solid state physics .",
    "bellissard conjectured that this algebra includes a crossed product of the algebra of functions on a topological space ( called `` the hull '' ) with the group of translations acting on it .",
    "in many cases , including the one - particle schrdinger equation in a quasiperiodic potential , the hull can be described explicitly .",
    "the quasiperiodic patterns of the same mld class have homeomorphic hulls , which allows one to characterize quasicrystals by algebraic topological invariants of their hulls . in this paper",
    "we show that some of these invariants , namely the cohomology ring of the hull may also occur in the study of the matching rules of quasicrystals .    before proceeding any further ,",
    "let us describe briefly the geometric constructions used in the paper .",
    "following the so - called `` cut - and - project '' method , a quasiperiodic point set is obtained as an intersection of @xmath4 affine subspace @xmath5 with a periodic arrangement of @xmath6 manifolds ( with boundary ) in @xmath7 .",
    "the space @xmath8 is usually referred to as a `` physical space '' , or `` cut '' , and the @xmath6 manifolds are called `` atomic surfaces '' .",
    "one can define affine coordinates on @xmath7 in such a way that the periodic translations of the arrangement of atomic surfaces correspond to the vectors with integer coefficients .",
    "the space @xmath7 can be factored by integer translations , yielding the @xmath9 torus @xmath0 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath8 is not contained in any proper rational subspace of @xmath7 , hence its image under the natural projection @xmath10 fills densely the torus @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we consider polyhedral atomic surfaces only . in order to simplify the proofs we also make several other non - essential assumptions .",
    "in particular , we require that all connected parts of the atomic surface be flat and parallel to an @xmath6 affine subspace @xmath11 . the @xmath7 is furnished with a euclidean metric , such that @xmath8 and @xmath12 are perpendicular .",
    "when this does not lead to confusion , we will implicitly switch between @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we will use symbols @xmath8 and @xmath12 to designate subspaces in the local coordinate system on @xmath0 .",
    "the term `` atomic surface '' will also signify the submanifold @xmath13 obtained by the natural projection of atomic surfaces from @xmath7 .",
    "likewise , we will speak about translations and convolutions in @xmath0 implying the operations in the universal cover of @xmath0 .",
    "the same applies to the definition of `` piecewise - linear '' ( pl ) subspaces of @xmath0 .",
    "the term `` matching rules '' is usually taken to mean the set of local constraints on a pattern ( a tiling or a discrete set of points ) guaranteeing its global quasiperiodicity .",
    "one can distinguish two approaches to the construction of matching rules .",
    "one approach , which was historically the first , is based on the scaling symmetry of the quasiperiodic pattern @xcite .",
    "the other one is built upon a more physical idea of propagation of the quasiperiodic order and leads to the topological formulation of the matching rules @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly recall the derivation of the latter approach .    from the very",
    "beginning of the study of quasicrystals it has become obvious that their stability is closely related with the possibility of propagation of information about the local phason coordinate . in particular , the stability requires that the places at which the structure undergoes reconstruction under a uniform phason shift be arranged in a special way .",
    "namely , when the magnitude of the phason shift tends to zero , the minimal distance between the places where the structure is rearranged should not grow indefinitely , because otherwise no physical mechanism could guarantee the simultaneousness of the rearrangements @xcite .",
    "more precisely , there should exist such positive number @xmath14 , that the union of disks of radius @xmath14 , centered at the places where the rearrangements occur , form a globally connected net for any finite uniform phason shift ( see fig .",
    "[ stable ] ) . in the general case",
    ", the geometry of this net could be quite complicated .",
    "however , we shall restrict our consideration to an important special class of structures described by flat atomic surfaces with polygonal boundary .",
    "this class includes in particular the so - called `` model sets '' @xcite . in this case",
    "the rearrangements of atoms under a uniform phason shift occur only when the cut crosses the boundary @xmath15 of the atomic surface ; this boundary thus plays a crucial role in the propagation of the quasiperiodic order .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that the matching rules impose certain constraints on the orientation of the faces @xmath16 of the boundary @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the orientation of each face @xmath16 is such that a _",
    "singular cut _ , crossing it at one point , will cross it at an infinite number of points .",
    "these points form an @xmath17 set @xcite in a hyperplane in the space of the cut , as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ stable ] .",
    "it is important to note , that the rearrangements of the quasiperiodic pattern under the action of the uniform phason shift occur simultaneously on the entire net of the fig .",
    "[ stable ] . since such rearrangements",
    "do not break the perfect quasiperiodic order , the matching faults may occur only at the places where the synchronization of rearrangements is broken at distances smaller than some finite @xmath14 .",
    "the idea of the topological description of the matching rules stems from an observation that such defects can be produced if one allows the cut to undulate . in this case",
    ", the matching faults would correspond to intersections of the undulating cut with the set @xmath18 , where @xmath19 stands for an @xmath20 in the parallel direction .",
    "the set @xmath21 is naturally referred to as `` obstacles '' of `` forbidden set '' @xcite .",
    "the obstacles @xmath21 are said to define strong matching rules if any map of the physical space into @xmath22 , satisfying some mild `` sanity conditions '' ( e.g. to be everywhere transversal to the direction of @xmath12 ) is homotopy equivalent to a perfect cut .",
    "let us take a closer look at the obstacles @xmath21 in the case when they define strong matching rules .",
    "in what follows it will be convenient to associate with each face @xmath16 of the atomic surface a pair of unit vectors @xmath23 defined ( up to a sign ) as follows .",
    "consider a singular cut crossing the face @xmath16 .",
    "this cut intersects @xmath16 at an infinite number of points belonging to a hyperplane in @xmath8 .",
    "we define @xmath24 as a normal to this hyperplane and @xmath25 as a normal to the face @xmath16 .",
    "the set @xmath21 can be conveniently represented as @xmath26 where the set @xmath27 enumerates the faces of the atomic surface and @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 clearly , for any @xmath30 , the set of obstacles @xmath31 defines the same matching rules .",
    "thus , one can replace the euclidean norm used to define the @xmath32 in the parallel space by any equivalent one .",
    "it is convenient to define the norm of a vector @xmath33 as @xmath34 where the index @xmath35 enumerates the faces of the atomic surface .",
    "note that the expression ( [ norm ] ) may not define a norm if the vectors @xmath36 span a proper subspace of @xmath8 .",
    "if this is the case , we can turn ( [ norm ] ) into a norm by appending to @xmath36 the vectors of a basis of the orthogonal complement to this subspace .",
    "the advantage of the norm ( [ norm ] ) over the ordinary euclidean one is that the set @xmath37 defined with the former has an especially simple geometry . to see this ,",
    "consider the intersection of a singular cut with the set @xmath38 ( [ facewise ] ) .",
    "this intersection is a union of @xmath39 with centers belonging to an @xmath17 set on a hyperplane perpendicular to @xmath40 .",
    "note also that an @xmath41 defined with the norm ( [ norm ] ) is a convex polyhedron and two of its faces are perpendicular to @xmath42 .",
    "as is clear from the figure [ thickened_hplane ] , the union of such @xmath39 for @xmath43 big enough is a `` thickened '' hyperplane ( a set of points @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 for some @xmath46 ) . this can only be possible",
    "if the set @xmath38 takes the form of a `` thickened torus '' : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an affine subtorus of @xmath0 of codimension two orthogonal to both @xmath42 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 is a segment of length @xmath51 parallel to @xmath42 , and the sign ` + ' stands for the convolution ( see remark in the introduction ) . in what follows",
    "we will frequently use the notion of thickened affine torus , and it is convenient to give it a broader definition , which will include ( [ thickened_torus ] ) as a special case :    a thickened affine torus @xmath52 is a convolution of an affine torus @xmath53 with a compact convex subset @xmath54 of @xmath8 : @xmath55    thus , we have shown that for @xmath43 big enough , the obstacle @xmath37 is a finite union of thickened affine tori ( [ tt ] ) .",
    "note also that @xmath37 can be equipped with a whitney stratification @xcite in such a way that any thickened torus containing a point of a stratum contains the entire stratum .",
    "following @xcite , we define the continuous hull @xmath56 of the quasiperiodic pattern as a completion of set of punctured patterns in the metric of `` approximate match '' @xmath57 ( roughly speaking , two patterns are separated by the distance @xmath58 in the metric @xmath57 if within the ball of radius @xmath59 the hausdorff distance between them is smaller than @xmath60 ; for exact definition see @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we establish the equivalence of the cohomology ring of @xmath56 and that of a complement of @xmath0 to an arrangement of thickened affine subtori @xmath1 .",
    "we start the proof by constructing a sequence of topological spaces @xmath61 parameterized by a real @xmath43 , and show that @xmath56 is homeomorphic to the inverse limit of this sequence .",
    "then we show that in the case of quasiperiodic patterns admitting matching rules , in the homotopy category the limit is attained for a finite @xmath62 .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the space @xmath63 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath2 .",
    "note that the representation of the continuous hull of a quasiperiodic pattern as an inverse limit of topological spaces has already been used in the literature @xcite .",
    "unlike the above references , the present approach deals directly with the cut - and - project representation of the quasiperiodic patern , which allows for a more intuitive description of the limit space .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the role of the matching rules in convergence of the sequence of cohomology groups of approximating spaces has been conjectured in @xcite .    the set @xmath64 represents the origins of the cuts producing non - singular patterns at least within the @xmath65 centered at the origin .",
    "in order to include the singular patterns , one has to add some more points to this space , which could be done by considering a metric closure of @xmath66 .",
    "let us start with the metric on @xmath0 induced by the euclidean metric of @xmath67 after factoring it over @xmath68 in the standard position .",
    "it induces an inner metric on @xmath66 @xcite ( in this metric the distance between two points equals the infimum of the lengths of the paths in @xmath0 connecting them and avoiding @xmath37 ) .",
    "denote the completion of @xmath69 with respect to this metric by @xmath70 .",
    "consider now an unbounded monotonously increasing sequence @xmath71 and the inclusion maps @xmath72 . because @xmath73 do not increase the distance between points , these maps can be extended to @xmath70 :",
    "@xmath74 one can define the inverse limit of the maps ( [ x_maps ] ) : @xmath75 together with the corresponding projections @xmath76 .",
    "the space @xmath77 is homeomorphic to the _ continuous hull _",
    "@xmath56 defined in @xcite .",
    "recall that @xmath56 is defined as completion of the space of non - singular patterns with respect to the metric of `` approximate match '' @xmath57 of @xcite ( two patterns have a distance lesser than @xmath60 if the hausdorff distance between their patches of size @xmath59 does not exceed @xmath60 ) .",
    "first of all , remark that there exist continuous maps @xmath78 , satisfying @xmath79 : @xmath80^{\\iota_{n+1 } } & x_{r_{n+1 } } \\ar[r]^{\\iota_{n } } & x_{r_n } \\ar[r]^{\\iota_{n-1 } } &   \\dots \\ar[r]^{\\iota_0 } & x_{r_0}\\\\ & mp \\ar[u]^{\\xi_{n+1 } } \\ar[ur]^{\\xi_{n } } \\ar[urrr]^{\\xi_{0 } } } \\ ] ] to define the maps @xmath81 , consider a point @xmath82 .",
    "this point is a limit of a sequence of patterns obtained by nonsingular cuts , which is cauchy in the metric of `` approximate match '' .",
    "the origins of these cuts form a sequence of points @xmath83 , where @xmath84 . in the metric of @xmath0",
    "the sequence @xmath85 converges to a point @xmath86 ( which may belong to a singular cut ! ) .",
    "consider the cuts with the origins belonging to the @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is an open pl @xmath89 in @xmath12 .",
    "those of them , which cross @xmath15 at the distance less or equal to @xmath90 from the origin , divide @xmath88 in a finite number of open polyhedral pieces @xmath91 .",
    "there exist @xmath92 and @xmath93 such that for @xmath94 all points @xmath85 belong to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is an @xmath89 in @xmath8 .",
    "consider any two points @xmath97 and @xmath98 of the sequence for which @xmath99 . since @xmath100 does not intersect @xmath101 , the distance between them in the induced inner metric of @xmath102 is bounded by @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the sequence @xmath85 is cauchy in the latter metric in @xmath104 and converges to a point in @xmath105 , which we set as @xmath106 .",
    "the continuity of @xmath107 and commutativity of ( [ inclusions ] ) are obvious .",
    "consider now the continuous map @xmath108 , satisfying @xmath109 , which exists by virtue of the universal property of inverse limits .",
    "since @xmath110 separates any two points @xmath111 for which @xmath112 , the map @xmath113 is injective . to establish the surjectivity of @xmath113 ,",
    "consider a point @xmath114 . for each @xmath115 ,",
    "its image @xmath116 can be approximated by a sequence of points @xmath117 : @xmath118 the convergence here is defined in the metric of @xmath119 and without loss of generality can be assumed to be uniform in @xmath115 .",
    "the inclusions @xmath120 allows one to consider @xmath121 as a point in @xmath70 for any @xmath122 .",
    "then the diagonal sequence @xmath123 converges in each @xmath105 to @xmath116 ( this follows from the fact that the maps @xmath124 of ( [ x_maps ] ) do not increase distance between points ) .",
    "the patterns obtained by cuts with origins at the points @xmath125 form a cauchy sequence in the metric of `` approximate match '' .",
    "the limit of this sequence is a point in @xmath56 which we set as @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , the map @xmath113 is a continuous bijection of a compact hausdorff space @xmath56 @xcite , and hence a homeomorphism .",
    "the consideration in the section [ matching ] suggests that the homotopy type of @xmath64 stabilizes with increasing @xmath43 , and one would expect the same for @xmath61 .",
    "this is indeed the case , more precisely , for the polygonal atomic surfaces the following result holds ( the proof is given in the appendix ) :    there exists an arrangement @xmath1 of thickened affine subtori of @xmath0 and a finite positive @xmath43 , such that for any @xmath127 there is an inclusion @xmath128 and the following maps are homotopy equivalences :    1 .",
    "the natural inclusion @xmath129 .",
    "2 .   the inclusion of complements @xmath130 .",
    "3 .   the map @xmath131 from ( [ x_maps ] ) .",
    "an immediate consequence of the above corollary follows is that the homomorphisms of cohomology rings induced by ( [ x_maps ] ) @xmath132 are isomorphisms for @xmath133 .",
    "thus the cohomology ring of the space @xmath77 equals that of @xmath2 : @xmath134 combining ( [ cohomring ] ) with the corollary 1 we conclude that the cohomology ring of the continuous hull @xmath56 of a quasiperiodic pattern admitting matching rules is isomorphic to that of a complement of @xmath0 to a finite arrangement of thickened affine tori of codimension 2 .",
    "this implies in particular that the cohomologies of @xmath56 are finitely generated and can be explicitly calculated as discussed below .",
    "our goal is to find the cohomology groups of the complement of the @xmath9 torus to an arrangement of thickened affine tori @xmath1 .",
    "let us start with the exact cohomological sequence of pair @xmath136 @xmath137^{\\alpha^ * } & h^*(t^n ) \\ar[d]^{\\beta^*}\\\\ & h^*(t^n \\backslash a ) \\ar[lu]^{d^*}}\\ ] ] as a whitney stratified subspace of a torus , @xmath1 can be surrounded by an open mapping cylinder neighborhood @xmath138 @xcite .",

    "this is not yet sufficient to relate @xmath143 with @xmath144 in each dimension ( this would be the case if the homologies of the surrounding space vanished in several adjacent dimensions , as is the case for a sphere , yielding alexander duality ) .",
    "however , if the rank of the homomorphism @xmath145 is known , it is still possible to separate the dimensions in the sequence ( [ longseq ] ) .",
    "indeed , ( [ longseq ] ) could be split in five - term exact sequences : @xmath146 & { \\rm im}(\\beta^{n-1 } ) \\ar[r ] & h^{n-1}(t^n\\backslash a ) \\ar[r]^{d^{n } } & h_{n - n}(a ) \\ar[r]^{\\alpha^n } & h^n(t^n ) \\ar[r ] & { \\rm im}(\\beta^{n } ) \\ar[r ] & 0},\\ ] ] yielding the following equation on betti numbers : @xmath147 where @xmath148 stands for the rank of the map @xmath149 thus , the ranks of cohomology groups of @xmath2 are determined by that of the homology groups of @xmath1 and the ranks of the maps ( [ restriction ] ) . to obtain the latter remark that by exactness of ( [ fiveterm ] ) , the kernel of @xmath150 is isomorphic to the image of @xmath151 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath151 is by poincar duality equal to the map @xmath152 induced by inclusion @xmath153 .",
    "the space @xmath1 defined in corollary 2 is in general case an arrangement of _ thickened _ affine tori . however , as mentioned in appendix , in many cases this space can be collapsed to an arrangement of ordinary affine tori , which simplifies the computation significantly . in this section",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is already collapsed to such an arrangement .",
    "the homology groups of an arrangement of affine tori could be conveniently computed using the method of simplicial resolutions ( see e.g. @xcite , although we follow here a slightly modified version of the method ) . with this technique , instead of the arrangement @xmath1",

    "the explicit construction of @xmath154 is as follows .",

    "note that each nonempty intersection of affine tori is itself a disjoint union of affine tori ( we treat a point as a special case of zero - dimensional torus ) .",
    "consider an abstract simplex @xmath157 with vertices enumerated by maximal chains of @xmath155 . for each @xmath158 , the maximal chains containing @xmath159 define a face of @xmath157 , which we denote by @xmath160 .",
