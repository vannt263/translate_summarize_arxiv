    "<S> the excited states in @xmath0 are investigated by using an extended version of the so - called tohsaki - horiuchi- schuck - rpke ( thsr ) wave function , where both the @xmath1 condensate and @xmath2 cluster asymptotic configurations are included . </S>",
    "<S> a new method is also used to resolve spurious continuum coupling with physical states . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the structures of the `` hoyle band '' states , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 states , which are recently observed above the hoyle state and of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , which are also quite recently identified in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> their resonance parameters and decay properties are reasonably reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> all these states have gaslike configurations of the @xmath1 clusters with larger root mean square radii than that of the hoyle state . </S>",
    "<S> the hoyle band is not simply considered to be the @xmath7 rotation as suggested by previous cluster model calculations , nor to be a rotation of a rigid - body triangle - shaped object composed of the @xmath1 particles . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to the specificity of the hoyle state , which has the @xmath1 condensate structure and gives a rise to the @xmath5 state with a prominent @xmath8 structure as a result of very strong monopole excitation from the hoyle state .    </S>",
    "<S> nuclear clustering is one of the fundamental degrees of freedom in nuclear excitation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hoyle state , the second @xmath9 state at @xmath10 mev in @xmath0 , as a typical example of the cluster states , has a long history ever since it was predicted by f. hoyle  @xcite and subsequently observed by cook _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as a key state in a synthesis of @xmath0 in stellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic and semi - microscopic cluster models have clarified that the hoyle state has the structure of the @xmath11 particle loosely coupling in an @xmath12-wave with the @xmath13 core  @xcite , not like a linear - chain structure of the @xmath1 particles proposed by morinaga in 1950 s  @xcite . in the last decade , however , the aspect of the @xmath11 condensate , where the @xmath1 clusters occupy an identical @xmath12-orbit , has triggered a great interest , since the so - called tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ( thsr ) wave function  @xcite , which has the @xmath11 condensate character , was shown to be equivalent to the hoyle state wave function obtained by solving the equations of the full @xmath1 resonating group method ( rgm ) or generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it is proposed that this band is formed by a rotation of a rigid @xmath1 cluster structure with an equilateral triangle shape based on @xmath19 symmetry  @xcite , which is , however , not consistent with the picture of loosely coupled @xmath8 structure or the @xmath1 gaslike structure . besides the @xmath14 and @xmath16 states , </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath20 state at @xmath21 mev with a broad width , @xmath22 mev , has been known for a long time . however , quite recently itoh _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ decomposed the broad @xmath20 state into the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states at @xmath23 mev and @xmath24 mev , with the widths of @xmath25 mev and @xmath26 mev , respectively  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation of the two @xmath20 states is consistent with theoretical prediction done by using the orthogonality condition model ( ocm ) combined with the complex scaling method ( csm ) and the analytical continuation of coupling constant ( accc ) method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was later on confirmed by another theoretical calculation using the ocm and csm with higher numerical accuracy  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd )  @xcite , fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd )  @xcite , and gcm calculations  @xcite , the observed @xmath5 state seems to be missing . the @xmath5 state given by the amd and fmd , which may correspond to the observed @xmath6 state , </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by a linear - chain - like configuration of the @xmath1 clusters and is not inconsistent with the @xmath5 state obtained by the gcm calculation  @xcite , or with the @xmath6 state in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where @xmath27_0 $ ] configuration is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be mentioned that the authors in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite claimed that the @xmath5 state has an @xmath12-wave dominant structure with more dilute density than that of the hoyle state . </S>",
    "<S> these are also consistent with the observed decay properties of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states that the former only decays into the @xmath28_0 $ ] channel and the latter decays into the @xmath27_0 $ ] channel with a sizable partial @xmath11-decay width  @xcite . in this letter , we investigate the structures of the positive parity excited states above the @xmath1 threshold by using an extended version of the thsr wave function  @xcite so as to include @xmath29 asymptotic configurations with a treatment of resonances . in particular , we focus on the `` hoyle band '' ( the @xmath18 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 states state at @xmath17 mev as the @xmath4 state , for simplicity , though it is located lower than the @xmath16 state at @xmath30 mev which forms the ground state rotational band . ] ) , and the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , together with the corresponding experimental data , though we also obtained some other positive parity excited states .    the extended version of the thsr wave function is written as follows : @xmath31 , \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath32 is an intrinsic wave function of the @xmath11 particle , where the @xmath33 configuration of the four nucleons is assumed with the size parameter @xmath34 , which is kept fixed at @xmath35 fm as almost the same value as at free space . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 is the jacobi coordinates between the @xmath1 particles and @xmath37 , for @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a fully microscopic wave function and every nucleons are antisymmetrized by @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 is a usual angular - momentum - projection operator . </S>",
    "<S> this wave function is characterized by the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which correspond to the sizes of the @xmath43 core and the remaining @xmath11 particle center - of - mass ( c.o.m . ) </S>",
    "<S> motion , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in the subsequent calculations , the axial symmetric deformation is assumed , i.e. @xmath44 @xmath45 , for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that the case of @xmath46 results in the original thsr wave function , where the c.o.m . </S>",
    "<S> motions of the @xmath1 particles relative to the total c.o.m . position are condensed into a lowest energy @xmath47 orbit , reflecting the bosonic feature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus this new thsr wave function is a natural extension of the original version , so that taking @xmath48 allows for the @xmath2 cluster structure , deviating from the identical @xmath1-cluster motion for @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this new wave function still gives gaslike cluster structure , as the original thsr wave function does , not being featured by the relative distance parameter between the @xmath43 and @xmath11 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be mentioned that the thsr - type wave functions were recently shown to give the best description for various cluster states such as the @xmath49 inversion doublet band in @xmath50  @xcite , @xmath1- and @xmath51-linear - chain states  @xcite , and @xmath52 cluster states in @xmath53  @xcite , etc .    for the excited states above the @xmath1 threshold </S>",
    "<S> , it is well known that the application of the bound state approximation gives accidental mixing between spurious continuum states and resonances . by using the fact that the root mean square ( r.m.s . ) radii of spurious continuum states </S>",
    "<S> are calculated to be extremely large within the bound state approximation , we developed a new method to remove the spurious components  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first we diagonalize the operator of mean square radius as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total c.o.m . position . </S>",
    "<S> we then remove out of the present model space the eigenstates belonging to unphysically large eigenvalues . by taking the following bases , @xmath56 with @xmath57 satisfying @xmath58 , we diagonalize hamiltonian as follows : @xmath59 for hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt volkov no .  2 force  @xcite , with the strength parameters slightly modified  @xcite , as effective nucleon - nucleon interaction . the cutoff radius is now taken to be @xmath60 fm . for diagonalizing the operator of r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> radius in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : cutoff1 ] ) , we adopt @xmath61 mesh points for the four - parameter set , @xmath62 , up to around @xmath63 fm . </S>",
    "<S> since the present extended thsr wave function can include @xmath2 asymptotic form by taking the large values of the two width parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the @xmath2 continuum components , as well as the @xmath1 continuum components , can be successfully removed by imposing the cut off for the mean square radius @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the more details will be shown in a forthcoming full paper .    </S>",
    "<S> although we could not obtain the excited states except for the @xmath18 and @xmath3 states by using the original thsr wave function  @xcite , we can now obtain the other observed @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath4 states by using the present extended thsr wave function with a treatment of resonances . since all these states are resonance states above the @xmath1 threshold , we then calculate the partial widths of the @xmath11 particle decaying into @xmath64_j$ ] channel , which we simply denote as @xmath65_j$ ] , based on the @xmath66-matrix theory  @xcite , where we use the following relations , @xmath67_j}= 2p_l(ka ) \\gamma^2_{[i , l]_j } , \\ </S>",

    "<S> \\label{eq : sfact}\\ ] ] we can see that except for the @xmath6 state , all the states have the largest contribution from the @xmath78_j$ ] channel . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the idea of @xmath2 rotation for the hoyle band , where the @xmath43 core is in the @xmath20 ground state .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the hoyle state is considered to be the @xmath1 condensate state , where the @xmath1 clusters mutually move in an identical @xmath12-wave . since the ground state of @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> is composed of weakly interacting @xmath79 clusters coupled loosely in a relative @xmath12-wave , it is natural that the hoyle state , with the @xmath11 condensate structure , also has a large overlap with the @xmath8 structure . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , which has a large overlap with the @xmath81 structure .    however , the @xmath1 condensate structure in the hoyle state is not the same as the usual @xmath8 rotation , in which the remaining @xmath11 cluster orbits outside the @xmath43 core . </S>",
    "<S> namely in the hoyle state , the remaining @xmath11 cluster also orbits inside the @xmath43 core and the independent @xmath1-cluster motion in an identical @xmath47-orbit is realized . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the hoyle state gains an extra binding , and hence its energy position is considered to be made lower than the @xmath82 line , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . the same effect is also argued in the study of the @xmath51 condensate and @xmath81 rotational band  @xcite , where the @xmath51 condensate is mentioned as `` complete condensate '' and the @xmath81 state as `` local condensate '' . due to the existence of the `` complete condensate '' , a higher @xmath20 excited state , which has the prominent @xmath8 structure , with the remaining @xmath11 cluster orbiting outside the @xmath43 core , appears as a higher nodal state , that is the @xmath5 state . </S>",

    "<S> the calculated strength @xmath83 @xmath84 is much larger than the other transitions , in spite of the fact that the @xmath85 strength between the hoyle and ground states @xmath86 @xmath84 is still strong enough as to be comparable to the single nucleon strength  @xcite .    _ </S>",

    "<S> since the outmost nodal position corresponds to a radius of repulsive core between the core @xmath43 and the @xmath11 cluster , due to the effect of the pauli principle , the disappearance of the nodes for the hoyle state indicates a dissolution of the @xmath43 core , and hence formation of the @xmath1 condensate . on the other hand , </S>",
