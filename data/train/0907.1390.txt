    "already in the early stages of quantum mechanics , l. pauling introduced the so called resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theory of the chemical bond@xcite , starting from the simple consideration that a spin singlet can be formed between any two valence electrons belonging to neighboring atoms . in this scheme , the ground state wave function of a molecule , such as benzene , can lower the energy by allowing the resonance among all possible valence bond configurations that can be drawn by linking the positions of two atoms ( e.g. the kekul and dewar configurations in the benzene molecule ) .",
    "however , its application was limited , since the number of bonds were growing exponentially with the number of atoms . as a consequence , the powerful language of molecular orbitals ( mo s ) applied to hartree - fock ( hf ) and post hf methods became popular . nonetheless , quite recently",
    ", the interest in rvb wave functions has been strongly revived .",
    "indeed , soon after the discovery of the high - tc superconductors , p. w. anderson realized that a single determinant wave function combined with a suitable real space correlation term  henceforth referred to as the jastrow factor  could be used to represent a complex rvb state.@xcite in this new ansatz a crucial ingredient is the form of the determinantal part of the wave function , that is required to be a singlet state with total spin @xmath1 .",
    "this picture , aimed at explaining the high - tc superconductivity , represents also a very efficient numerical implementation of the original rvb idea , soon reconsidered in this form for lattice models@xcite , and then in realistic simulations of atoms and small molecules@xcite .",
    "though the anderson s rvb wave function has been originally defined just for singlet states , the same concept can be applied to electronic systems with arbitrary spin @xmath2 , with the inclusion of unpaired orbitals .",
    "this is a very important generalization in order to describe polarized compounds , like the transition element compounds which show high - spin configurations in their low - lying energy states . in the actual rvb description of realistic systems ,",
    "it is necessary to resort to standard quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods@xcite in order to compute the variational expectation values of the energy and correlation functions@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we propose an extension of the rvb picture that is based on a mo expansion of the singlet valence bond pairs defining the wave function .",
    "this ansatz yields a correlation consistent rvb representation by means of a constrained energy minimization which keeps the number of mo s fixed while stretching the bond . by setting this number to a value such that a jastrow correlated hf wave function is recovered in the atomization limit ,",
    "we obtain , with a single determinant , a remarkably accurate description of the bond , even when strong non - dynamical correlations are present in the system . in this paper",
    "we illustrate the method and test it on a set of dimers composed by first row atoms and on selected small molecules belonging to the so - called g1 set ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , often used to test new theoretical methods .",
    "the approach described in this work has also been applied to the study of the controversial ground state of the iron dimer@xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we describe the rvb wave function and our extension , and we show test results on various homonuclear and heteronuclear dimers ( , , , , , , , and ) . in appendix [ molorb ]",
    "we describe the constrained minimization of the molecular orbital expansion of the trial wave function . in appendix",
    "[ check_app ] , we present a systematic study of the variational energies obtained with the rvb wave function , as a function of the number of molecular orbitals ( appendix  [ c2molapp ] ) and the size of the atomic basis set used ( appendix  [ basisconvergence ] ) .",
    "the fundamental ingredient of our variational method is an n - electron rvb wave function , called jagp since it is the product of a jastrow factor j , and a determinantal part which is an antisymmetrized geminal power ( agp ) , previously introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "below we shall describe this wave function .    in the case of @xmath4 electrons with @xmath5 up spins ( @xmath6 down spins ) , where for simplicity we take @xmath7 , we can describe a pure spin state with total spin @xmath8 and maximum spin projection @xmath9 by means of the antisymmetrized product of @xmath6 singlet pairs and @xmath10 unpaired orbitals corresponding to the remaining spin - up electrons .",
    "hence the determinantal part reads @xmath11 with @xmath12 the antisymmetrization operator , @xmath13 the @xmath14-dimensional vector of coordinates , @xmath15 a symmetric orbital function describing the singlet pairs , and @xmath16 the unpaired orbitals .",
    "it can be shown that the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ agp ] ) can be rewritten in terms of a single determinant ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "similar constructions with definite spin can be done , by allowing also triplet pairing between the @xmath10 unpaired electrons .",
    "since this involves a bit more complicated algebra like the use of pfaffians@xcite , we do not consider it here .",
    "the jastrow factor takes into account the electronic correlation between two electrons and is conventionally split into a homogeneous interaction @xmath18 depending on the relative distance between two electrons ( i.e. a two - body term ) , and a non homogeneous contribution depending also on the electron - ion distance , included in the one - body @xmath19 , three - body @xmath20 and four - body @xmath21 terms .",
    "@xmath19 is a single particle function which is important to compensate the change in the one particle density induced by @xmath18 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as well as to satisfy the electron - ion cusp conditions .",
    "the one- and two - body terms @xmath19 and @xmath18 are defined by the following equations : @xmath22},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath23},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are indexes running over the electrons , and @xmath25 runs over different single particle orbitals @xmath26 centered on the atomic center @xmath27 . @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote electron - ion and electron - electron distances respectively .",
    "the corresponding cusp conditions are fixed by the function @xmath30/2 $ ] ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are optimizable variational parameters .",
    "the three- and four - body jastrow @xmath33 are given by : @xmath34 with @xmath35 , being a two - electron coordinate function that can be expanded into the same single - particle basis used for @xmath36 : @xmath37 with @xmath38 optimizable parameters .",
    "three - body ( electron ion electron ) correlations are described by the diagonal matrix elements @xmath39 , whereas four - body correlations ( electron ion electron ion ) are described by matrix elements with @xmath40 .",
    "the exhaustive and complete expression of the jastrow factor @xmath41 that we adopt in this work allows to take into account not only weak electron - electron interactions of the van der waals ( vdw ) type , but it is also extremely effective for suppressing higher energy configurations with overlapping valence bonds , which otherwise lead to a too large electron density around an atom .    as any functions of two coordinates , also the pairing function @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ agp ] ) can be expanded in terms of single particle orbitals .",
    "we can thus write @xmath43 where @xmath0 is large enough , and @xmath44 is an orthogonal single particle basis set , which reaches its complete basis set limit ( cbs ) for @xmath45 .",
    "notice that , in these notations , we assume that the @xmath10 unpaired orbitals @xmath46 of eq .",
    "( [ agp ] ) correspond to the indexes @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ pairing ] ) .    the single particle orbitals @xmath46 can be conveniently chosen as the mo s obtained with a conventional restricted hf ( rhf ) calculation .",
    "the mo basis allows us to write eq .",
    "( [ pairing ] ) in a diagonal form equivalent to a more involved matrix form when the mo s are developed in an atomic basis set @xcite of orbitals @xmath48 where @xmath27 indicates the atomic center and @xmath49 the type : @xmath50 . the coefficients @xmath51 , as well as the weights @xmath52 , can be used as variational parameters defining the geminal in eq .",
    "( [ pairing ] ) . by truncating the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ pairing ] ) to a number of mo s @xmath0 equal to the number of electron pairs plus the unpaired orbitals , namely @xmath53 , one recovers the usual rhf theory , because the antisymmetrization operator @xmath12 singles out only one slater determinant .",
    "moreover , the mo weights @xmath52 affect only an overall prefactor of this slater determinant , so that their actual values are irrelevant in this case .",
    "however , the pairing function is generally not limited to have only @xmath6 non vanishing eigenvalues @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the rvb wave function represents a clear extension of the rhf theory , not only for the presence of the jastrow factor , which considerably improves the dynamical correlations , but mainly because its determinantal part goes beyond rhf when @xmath54 , by including also non - dynamical correlations .",
    "quite generally , a gain in energy and a more accurate calculation are expected whenever @xmath55 .      the main property used in the following derivation relies on the fact that the atoms are well described by a jastrow correlated rhf ( jhf ) wave function .",
    "indeed , the application of the jastrow factor @xmath56 on a simple hf slater determinant provides at least @xmath57 of the correlation energy in all the atoms ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and table  [ tab_jhf_at ] ) . here",
    "we show that it is possible to extend and remarkably improve the correlated hf approximation for the chemical bond , by means of a rvb wave function with an _ appropriate _",
    "number @xmath0 of mo s appearing in eq .",
    "( [ pairing ] ) .",
    "these mo s are chosen to minimize the energy expectation value in presence of the jastrow factor , while an upper bound on the number @xmath0 is univocally determined by imposing that , when the atoms are at large distance , we can not obtain an energy below the sum of the jhf atomic energies .",
    "we further checked the effects of a larger three and four - body jastrow factor ( 34bj ) in the case of .",
    "we performed simulations at the experimental bond length with the jhf wave function and the jagp with @xmath58 molecular orbitals ( whose results agrees with the jagpn@xmath59 as shown in appendix  [ c2molapp ] ) with the @xmath60 jastrow used for all the other cases and for two larger basis sets ( namely @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ) .",
    "results are shown in table  [ c2_total_energies ] .",
    "as expected , effects on the molecular total energy of a larger three- and four - body jastrow are negligible in the lrdmc at least for the rvb wave function .",
    "for all the other cases , the largest jastrow basis provides an energy gain of at most 1 mh with respect to the smaller basis .",
    "we computed the binding energy of the all electron and pseudo- for a bond length of @xmath63 a.u . and found a lrmdc value of @xmath64 ev and @xmath65 ev respectively .",
    "the discrepancy between the two findings is @xmath66 mh and is within our accuracy limit .",
    "such poor description of the binding energy at experimental bond length occurs because the jagp for the molecule is not as accurate as the atomic jagp ( 99.2% and 99.7%@xcite of the correlation energy at the dmc level , respectively ) ."
