    "the contact interaction , or as sometimes called point or zero range interaction , plays an important role in nuclear physics .",
    "the short range nucleon - nucleon interaction is often simulated by a contact interaction in different models .",
    "an effective interaction of contact type ( skyrme - force ) has been very frequently and successfully used in mean - field descriptions of heavy nuclei including the hartree - fock or hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently contact interaction has been applied in three - body calculations of halo nuclei @xcite and in the study of the role of resonance states in pair correlations @xcite .",
    "another example is the constituent - quark model for the application of the contact interaction .",
    "several non - relativistic three - body calculations have calculated the spectra of the three quark system @xcite . despite the popularity of the contact force",
    "even its definition is problematic .",
    "the hamiltonian of a two - body system interacting via a contact interaction is written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the reduced mass , @xmath3 is the three dimensional laplacian , @xmath4 is the dirac delta - function and @xmath5 is the  strength \" of the contact interaction .",
    "the interpretation of the equation ( [ 2bdelta ] ) is not trivial due to the singular nature of the dirac delta - function . by using a complete set of states to diagonalize the above hamiltonian one gets infinite binding energy for the system . to get",
    "a more meaningful result one usually truncates the configuration space @xcite with some `` reguralization '' scheme .",
    "this truncation leads to a model dependence and results of different approaches can only be related and reproduced if one uses the same strategy to reguralize the interaction .",
    "due to this approach it is widely believed that the contact interaction is meaningful only in a truncated space .    in this paper",
    "we propose a different approach where the application of the contact interaction is based on mathematically rigorous theory @xcite .",
    "this proper contact interaction ( pci ) is free from the above mentioned problems .",
    "the pci gives finite energy and there is no dependence on basis truncations or extra parameters .",
    "this pci has zero range and it acts non - trivially only in the @xmath6 partial wave .",
    "these two properties are what physicists expect from a contact interaction .",
    "the contact force was introduced in nuclear physics by bethe and peierls @xcite and thomas @xcite in 1935 .",
    "the mathematically correct treatment of the operator ( [ 2bdelta ] ) dates back to the work of berezin and faddeev @xcite in 1961 .",
    "an english review of the early russian works on two and three - body problems with pci can be found in ref .",
    "mathematically rigorous treatment of the operator ( [ 2bdelta ] ) is given by different approaches .",
    "one of them is the coupling constant re - normalization procedure of berezin and faddeev @xcite .",
    "this technique was applied also in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "other approaches are the reguralization of the green - function @xcite , the dimensional reguralization @xcite , or the theory of the dirichlet forms @xcite .",
    "we will use the self - adjoint extension theory of the contact force which is described in great detail in the monograph @xcite .",
    "each of these approaches leads to the same spectrum of the two - body hamiltonian with pci .",
    "the mathematically correct formulation of the pci in two - body problem is completely solved .",
    "it gives the two - body t - matrix in analytical form .",
    "this t - matrix can be used in subsequent three - body calculations based on the faddeev equations . however ,",
    "if we want to solve the three - body schrdinger equation in coordinate space using some approximations then we need a local realization of the pci .",
    "the aim of the paper is to give a few explicit local potential realizations of the pci and apply it in three - body calculations .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii the two - body spectrum of the pci is discussed . in part",
    "iii the general theory of the local potential realization of the pci is reviewed and a few explicit realizations are given .",
    "in sections ii and iii.a those theorems of the monograph @xcite are reviewed which are relevant for our purpose . in section",
    "iv the numerical solution of the two - body problem with pci are shown . finally , at the section v we present three - body calculation with pci for the halo nuclei @xmath0li .",

    "one can understand this using the following arguments ( see e.g chapter 14.1 in ref .",

    "if the range of the potential @xmath32 tends to zero ( contact force ) then the boundary condition parameter becomes independent of the energy and in this way we can assign any value to it . thus continuously many zero range interactions can be defined .",

    "we will take the scaled pschl - teller and exponential realizations of the pci .",
    "a shallow neutron core interaction is taken in order to avoid the problem of the pauli projection .",
    "the explicit form of this potential is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in table",
    "iv two calculations with the pschl - teller realization of the pci are shown . in the first case the parameterization of the pci corresponds to the experimental value ( @xmath107 fm ) of the scattering length of the free neutron - neutron system .",
    "the second calculation corresponds to the case when the parameter of the pci is adjusted until the three - body energy reproduces the experimental value ( @xmath115 ) of the two - neutron separation energy of @xmath0li @xcite .",
    "this parameter of the pci leads to a @xmath116 fm scattering length for the dineutron . the mean square radius of the neutron - neutron and the core - dineutron system is also calculated in this case .",
    "from table iv we can conclude that the effective neutron - neutron interaction is not consistent with the free neutron - neutron scattering .",
    "we had to reduce the scattering length of the dineutron system in order to reproduce the experimental value of the two neutron separation energy .",

    "the results of table iv are very similar to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where the standard method ( restricted model space ) was used to handle the contact interaction . although the results are qualitatively similar there is a deep conceptual difference between the two calculations . in our calculations with pci we indeed used a zero range force whereas in the works",
    "@xcite , due to the restriction of the model space , the effective range is much larger than ours . in principle",
    "the pci has zero range , in practice we can reach 0.01 fm . in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite the effective range is roughly 2 fm and this explain the quantitative difference of the two calculations .",
    "we have repeated the three - body calculation , replacing the pschl - teller realization by the exponential realization of the pci .",
    "the results are shown in table v. of course , due to the different realization of the pci , the energy corresponding to a given @xmath39 are different in table v and in the second column of table iv .",
    "what is important is that the extrapolated values , which correspond to the pci , are very close to each other in both realizations .    because we use the local realization of the pci we have to carry out the limit @xmath44",
    "numerically in the three - body calculation and this requires great care . the stochastic variational method @xcite , which proved to be very accurate in few body problems , is used to solve the bound state three - body problem .",
    "it is clear from tables iv and v that convergence is reached in the order of a few tenth kev .",
    "this means that our proposed method for the correct handling of the contact interaction works for three - body problems .",
    "we have reviewed the mathematically , rigorously defined proper contact interaction and shown that it has the properties of the standard notion of the contact interaction .",
    "this proper contact interaction is free from the problem ( infinite binding energy ) of the standard treatment of the contact interaction .",
    "local potential realizations of the abstract proper contact interaction were given in terms of pschl - teller , exponential and square - well potentials .",
    "the calculation for @xmath0li revealed that the proper contact interaction with local realization can be incorporated into three - body calculations based on the coordinate space schrdinger equation provided this latter is solved accurately enough .",
