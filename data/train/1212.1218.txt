    "the numerical model that we use to study odd convection was described in detail in , so here we mention only its most relevant features .",

    "we solve the evolution equations for momentum , temperature , and composition in the boussinesq approximation , which are @xmath1 here @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are perturbations of pressure , density , temperature , and mean molecular weight respectively , and @xmath6 is the vertical component of the velocity @xmath7 ; all of these quantities are assumed to be periodic in all three cartesian directions .",
    "we use subscript  0 s to denote the unperturbed , background fields , which we assume are functions of @xmath8 alone .",
    "the background gradients of temperature , @xmath9 , and mean molecular weight , @xmath10 , are both negative in the situation considered here , as is the adiabatic temperature gradient , @xmath11 we consider a small volume within which the diffusivities of momentum , @xmath12 , temperature , @xmath13 , and composition , @xmath14 , can be treated as constant , and the density perturbations can be expressed as a linear function of the temperature and composition perturbations ,    & & & = - t , & [ eq : rho ] + & & = -()_p , & = ( ) _ p , t . &    both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are positive for any realistic equation of state .",
    "we approximate @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the other coefficients in equations  ( [ eq : mom - dim])([eq : mu - dim ] ) as constant within our small domain , and we suppose that the background temperature and molecular weight profiles are linear in @xmath8 , so that the total temperature and composition fields are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with @xmath9 , @xmath19 , and @xmath10 all constant .",
    "the schwarzschild and ledoux stability criteria are then    & & ( t_0z - t_0z^ad ) & > 0 & [ eq : schwarz ] + & & ( t_0z - t_0z^ad ) & > _ 0z & [ eq : ledoux ]    respectively .",
    "we are concerned here with regions which satisfy ( [ eq : ledoux ] ) but not ( [ eq : schwarz ] ) , i.e. ,  regions in which @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the `` inverse density ratio , '' @xmath22 from a linear stability analysis of equations  ( [ eq : mom - dim])([eq : mu - dim ] ) , it can be shown that such regions are unstable to double - diffusive instability if @xmath21 lies in the range @xmath23 @xcite where @xmath24 is the critical value @xmath25 here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the diffusivity ratios    & & & = /_t & + & & & = _ /_t . &",
    "in astrophysical objects , both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are typically of order @xmath28 or smaller , and so the instability window given by equation  ( [ eq : window ] ) is rather wide .",
    "the instability is oscillatory , and has a typical horizontal lengthscale @xmath29 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we are interested primarily in the fluxes of heat and composition through odd convection . as in we measure these fluxes in terms of nusselt numbers , defined as    & & _ t & = 1 - & [ eq : nut - dim ] + & & _ & = 1 - , & [ eq : nuc - dim ]    where the notation @xmath30 represents a volume average over the entire domain .",
    "the total vertical fluxes of heat , @xmath31 , and composition , @xmath32 , can be reconstructed from these as follows :    & & & = - _ tt_0z & + & & & = -_t_tt_0z + ( _ t-1)_tt_0z^ad & [ eq : flux_t ] + & & f_&= - _ _ 0z & + & & & = -___0z , & [ eq : flux_c ]    where @xmath33 is the specific heat .",
    "we note that , in general , the thermal nusselt number @xmath34 defined by equation  ( [ eq : nut - dim ] ) is _ not _ the ratio of the total heat flux to the diffusive ( i.e. ,  radiative plus conductive ) heat flux , unless the adiabatic temperature gradient @xmath19 is zero .",
    "however , as in , we can introduce the total `` potential temperature '' @xmath35 which has background gradient @xmath36 and perturbation @xmath37 , in order to write the thermal nusselt number as @xmath38 so we may regard @xmath34 as the ratio of the total and diffusive fluxes of potential temperature .",
    "since @xmath39 and @xmath4 are equal , in what follows we will refer to @xmath39 as simply `` the temperature perturbation '' .    in double - diffusive convection ,",
    "an important quantity is the `` buoyancy flux ratio '' @xmath40 , which we define as @xmath41 @xcite as the ratio of the _ total _ fluxes , rather than the turbulent fluxes .",
    "see for more detail . ] .",
    "this is closely related to the core erosion `` efficiency factor '' @xmath42 introduced by @xcite , which measures the fraction of a planet s luminosity that is used to erode the stable compositional stratification at the boundary with the core . in the limit where the transport of both heat and composition is dominated by convection ( i.e. ,  @xmath43 ) this fraction is precisely @xmath40 .",
    "the gravitational potential energy released from the thermal stratification must exceed the potential energy used to erode the compositional stratification , which implies that @xmath44 . as shown in",
    ", @xmath40 plays an important role in the formation of layers , and possibly also controls the evolution of layers after their formation @xcite .    for computational convenience , we work mainly with nondimensional quantities . as in we nondimensionalize equations  ( [ eq : mom - dim])([eq : rho ] ) using the lengthscale @xmath45 from equation  ( [ eq : d ] ) as well as the scales    & & [ t ] & = d^2/_t , & + & & [ ] & = d|t_0z - t_0z^ad| , & + & & [ ] & = d(/)|t_0z - t_0z^ad| , & + & & [ p ] & = _ 0 . &    the governing equations are then @xmath46 where all variables are now dimensionless . the definitions ( [ eq : nut - dim])([eq : nuc - dim ] ) of the nusselt numbers then become    & & _ t & = 1 + & [ eq : nut ] + & & _ & = 1 + . &",
    "[ eq : nuc ]    we will also make use of alternative definitions of the nusselt numbers ,    & & _ t & = 1 + & [ eq : mut ] + & & _ & = 1 + , & [ eq : muc ]    which are based on the rates of thermal and compositional dissipation , and are sometimes called `` cox numbers '' .",
    "we note that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are guaranteed to be positive at all times , whereas @xmath34 and @xmath49 are not .",
    "however , it can be readily verified , from equations  ( [ eq : divu])([eq : mu ] ) , that the definitions ( [ eq : nut])([eq : nuc ] ) and ( [ eq : mut])([eq : muc ] ) yield the same result after taking a time average in a statistically steady state @xcite .",
    "the advantage of retaining both forms is explained in section  [ sec : measure ] .",
    "in principle , any particular instance of odd convection is characterized by the three dimensionless parameters @xmath21 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . however , in it was shown that , within the instability window given by equation  ( [ eq : window ] ) , there is another critical value of @xmath21 , say @xmath50 , below which odd convection spontaneously transitions into layered convection . presented empirical scaling laws for @xmath50 , and for the transport of heat and composition prior to the development of layers .",

    "this result implies that there is a significant range of density ratios @xmath21 for which layers form spontaneously , and so the transport through layered convection must be considered in models of astrophysical objects .",

    "the local ledoux stability criterion can be expressed as @xmath62 ( cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ledoux ] ) ) , so this indicates that the layers are subject to overturning convection . within each layer , the total composition @xmath63 and the total potential temperature @xmath64 are both roughly uniform , and there are strong jumps in @xmath63 and @xmath64 across the interfaces between adjacent layers .",

    "the remaining columns show layered convection with 3 , 2 , and 1 layers respectively . because the perturbation is plotted in the top row , rather than the total composition",
    ", the layers appear as regions with a relatively weak vertical gradient , and the interfaces appear as regions with a strong vertical gradient of the opposite sign .",

    "* ) , but only for prandtl numbers @xmath67 @xcite . however , in fingering convection the initial height of the layers is typically much larger than the lengthscale of the linear double - diffusive instability , whereas here we find that layers initially form on a scale comparable to that of the linear instability . in the simulation shown in figure  [ fig : evolution ] , for example , the fastest growing linear mode has a wavelength of roughly @xmath68 , i.e. ,  @xmath69 of the domain size , and the initial layer height is @xmath70 of the domain size .",
    "figure  [ fig : interface ] shows more detail of the interface structure during the 2-layer phase .",
    "we find that the interfaces are highly dynamic and turbulent , exhibiting structure on scales that are much smaller than the wavelength of the fastest growing linear mode .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the flat , laminar interfaces found in simulations and laboratory experiments of odd convection at larger prandtl number ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* both of which have @xmath71 ) .",
    "the composition field exhibits structure on finer scales than the temperature field , as expected because of the smaller diffusivity of composition . on larger scales ,",
    "the temperature and composition fields display similar features , such that the temperature field resembles a coarse - grained version of the composition field .",
    "by contrast , the density field has even finer structure , since it depends on the difference between the composition and temperature fields .    , at @xmath72 .",

    "as mentioned earlier , the mean value of each flux increases significantly when layers first form , and increases still further when layers merge @xcite .",

    "the vertical lines indicate the two times shown in figure  [ fig : min_max ] . using @xmath74 rather than @xmath73 to measure the mean fluxes has the advantage of filtering out fluctuations in the fluxes on short timescales , while retaining the important long timescale information.,width=377 ]",
    "we note that the two definitions for the nusselt numbers both yield consistent results for the mean flux , although the definition based on the instantaneous fluxes exhibits larger fluctuations in the homogeneous , pre - layer phase of the simulation , during which the dynamics are dominated by wave - like , oscillatory motions @xcite .    between layer merger events the mean fluxes and kinetic energy oscillate quasi - periodically between high and low values , with relative departures from the mean flux of order unity .",
    "the oscillations occur as the flow in the simulation cycles between states that are highly turbulent and states that are more quiescent . in the quiescent state ,",
    "the interfaces are roughly horizontal , whereas in the turbulent state the interfaces have undulations on a horizontal scale comparable to the thickness of the layers . for illustration ,",
    "figure  [ fig : min_max ] shows the composition perturbation , and the horizontally - averaged total composition @xmath63 , at two times during the one - layer phase . at the first time , @xmath78 , the interface is in a quiescent state , and at the second , @xmath79 , the interface is in a more turbulent state .",
    "these two times correspond to minima and maxima in the nusselt numbers , as shown in figure  [ fig : nu ] .",
    "the quasi - periodic nature of the oscillations in the fluxes suggests that they are caused by large - scale gravity - wave motions of the interfaces .",
    "for an interfacial gravity wave of horizontal scale @xmath53 , the oscillation frequency is @xmath80 @xcite , where @xmath81 represents the jump in potential density across the interface . for a staircase of layers of thickness @xmath53",
    "we have @xmath82 , and so the characteristic gravity - wave frequency is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the buoyancy frequency associated with the mean stratification , which in dimensionless units is @xmath85 . in the simulation shown in figure  [ fig : nu ] this corresponds to a ( dimensionless ) oscillation period of @xmath86 , which is approximately half of the typical period of the observed flux oscillations .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the disturbances to the interfaces seen in figure  [ fig : min_max ] are far more complex in structure than linear gravity waves .",

    "the profiles show the horizontal average of the total composition @xmath63 , and the volume rendering shows the perturbation @xmath5 using the same color bar at both times.,height=188 ]    previous models of layered convection in astrophysical objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have assumed that the interfaces are horizontal , laminar , and diffusive . if that were the case , the fluxes though the interfaces could be determined simply by measuring the vertical gradients of the horizontally - averaged @xmath88 and @xmath63 profiles in the center of each interface .",
    "figures  [ fig : nu ] and [ fig : min_max ] show that this type of model can not be valid here , because the fluxes are maximal when these gradients are weakest .",
    "in fact , since the interfaces are not horizontal , the fluxes depend on the local gradients within the interfaces _ and _ on the effective surface area of the interfaces .",
    "figure  [ fig : min_max ] suggests that variations in the surface area are the main cause of the oscillations in the fluxes .",
    "the interface behavior seen here somewhat resembles that seen in the compressible , two - dimensional simulations of @xcite at low prandtl number .",
    "@xcite also attributed the transport across the interfaces to the breaking of interfacial gravity waves , although the interpretation was complicated by interactions with the boundaries of the domain .",
    "the disturbances to the interface in figure  [ fig : min_max ] have the same horizontal lengthscale as the width of the domain , @xmath89 , suggesting that , here also , the dynamics may be sensitive to the choice of domain size and the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , as described in appendix  [ sec : robust ] , similar behavior is seen in all of our layered simulations , and the results do not depend significantly on the size of the domain .",
    "our aim is to determine how the mean fluxes of heat and composition , measured in terms of dimensionless nusselt numbers , depend on the dimensionless parameters @xmath90 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the average ( dimensionless ) layer height , which we denote as @xmath53 . as described in the last section , during each layered phase the fluxes of heat and composition",
    "oscillate quasi - periodically about a mean value , and reliably calculating the mean fluxes requires time averaging over several of these oscillations .",
    "we measure the mean fluxes and estimate the errors in our measurements as follows :    1 .",
    "we first identify the number of layers during each phase of the simulation , by counting the number of `` steps '' in the vertical profiles of the horizontally averaged fields , and matching each merger event with the corresponding increase in the nusselt numbers .",
    "once we have identified the time interval corresponding to a particular layered phase , we then divide this interval into four equal subintervals , and calculate the average values of @xmath34 , @xmath49 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 during each subinterval using equations  ( [ eq : nut])([eq : muc ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain eight separate measurements of the thermal and compositional fluxes during each layered phase .",
    "we treat each of our eight measurements as independent , and calculate their mean and standard deviation , which yields estimates for the mean flux and the measurement error .",
    "( a similar method was used to estimate the measurement error in . )",

    "we have measured the mean fluxes of heat and composition in an extensive suite of numerical simulations of layered odd convection . in these simulations , layers develop spontaneously from an initially homogeneously turbulent state , and subsequently merge into a single layer spanning the entire height of the simulation domain .",
    "the formation and merging of layers is , to some extent , a stochastic process , but nevertheless occurs at a similar rate in simulations with different domain sizes and numerical resolutions .",
    "the development of layers leads to a significant increase in the mean fluxes , and the fluxes increase still further each time layers merge .",
    "we find that the mean fluxes are approximately proportional to the average thickness of the layers to the power @xmath55 , as predicted by @xcite .",

    "the structure of the interfaces , and their effective surface area , is highly time dependent , which produces order unity variations in the fluxes of heat and composition during each layered phase .",
    "previous models for the transport by odd convection have assumed that the interfaces remain flat and laminar , implying that the fluxes are limited by the vertical gradients of the horizontally averaged profiles within the interfaces .",
    "our numerical results demonstrate that transport at low prandtl number is more efficient than predicted by such quasi - one - dimensional models .",

    "recently , @xcite have proposed a model for the transport by odd convection in jupiter s interior .",
    "they use heuristic arguments to obtain upper and lower bounds for the height of layers in jupiter , and thereby derive bounds for the thermal and compositional transport . in all of our simulations , however , the layers eventually merge into a single layer with the same height as the computational domain , so our results make no prediction for the height of layers in real objects . whether simulations performed in taller domains would yield a saturation thickness for layers",
    "is unknown . for _ fingering _ convection , it has been argued by @xcite that there exists such a saturation thickness .",

    "layers of thickness @xmath165 therefore do not undergo further merging . in our simulations of _ odd _ convection , by contrast , @xmath40 appears to asymptote toward a limiting value as @xmath166 , so this argument does not apply .",

    "an alternative picture for layer merging has been proposed by @xcite , but their model also predicts that the merging of layers proceeds indefinitely .",
    "we note that the boussinesq approximation assumed in our numerical model breaks down once the layer thickness becomes comparable to the local pressure scale height of the planet or star . in practice",
    ", this may be what limits the size of layers in real astrophysical objects . at this point ,",
    "convection within the layers would be almost indistinguishable from `` normal '' overturning convection , allowing the usual mixing - length approximation for the transport to be applied .    an important issue that has not been explicitly addressed",
    "so far is the timescale for layer merging .",
    "our results suggest that this timescale is an increasing function of layer height , which is in accordance with the theory of layer mergers proposed by @xcite .",
    "if the timescale for merging in an astrophysical object eventually becomes comparable to the global evolution timescale , then the layers will never reach a saturation thickness , and the evolution of the layers must then be modeled as an explicitly time - dependent process in 1d structure and evolution models .",
    "future papers will study the dynamics of layer mergers in more detail , in order to determine what sets the merging timescale , and how it depends on layer height .",

    "in this appendix we investigate the influence of numerical resolution and domain size on the initial layer height , the timescale for layer formation and merging , the time - averaged fluxes , and the amplitude of oscillations in the fluxes .      because of the disparity between the diffusivities of temperature and composition",
    ", double - diffusive convection always features a wide range of dynamical length scales , making this a tough problem to model numerically .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in section  [ sec : typical ] , the emergence of layers is associated with an increase in the overall level of turbulence , and increased spectral energy at all scales in a given simulation @xcite . properly resolving the layered phase",
    "therefore requires even greater numerical resolution than resolving the homogenous phase . in order to check that the thermal and compositional fluxes in our simulations are not sensitive to the numerical resolution",

    "the simulation with the coarsest resolution ( @xmath168 ) only resolves structures on lengthscales @xmath172 , but even in this simulation the linear double - diffusive instability is well resolved ( recall that the fastest growing linear mode has wavelength @xmath173 at these parameters ) .",
    "each simulation undergoes a homogeneous phase , then forms three layers , which later merge into two layers , then one layer .",
    "the duration of each layered phase varies between the four simulations , suggesting that the merging of layers is , to some extent , a stochastic process .",

    "the lowest resolution simulation is clearly under - resolved , with significant features at the nyquist scale , whereas the highest resolution simulation displays no numerical artifacts .     from the @xmath168 resolution simulation at @xmath176 ( left ) and the @xmath171 resolution simulation at @xmath177 (",
    "both cases show cross - sections through the interface at the start of the one - layer phase , which is typically the least well - resolved stage in any simulation.,width=604 ]    nevertheless , the mean fluxes through these two simulations are approximately equal in the one - layer phase , which suggests that the transport of both heat and composition is dominated by scales @xmath172 in these simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig:4cases ] compares time series of the nusselt numbers from four simulations performed in domains of different heights and widths .",
    "each simulation has @xmath158 , @xmath100 , and the same numerical resolution , i.e. ,  the same ( dimensionless ) distance between neighboring grid points .",
    "these four simulations exhibit the following features , which we find to be typical :    * the cases with wider domains ( @xmath178 ) take longer to form layers than the cases with narrower domains ( @xmath89 ) . *",
    "the initial layer height is not very sensitive to the size of the domain , provided that the domain is sufficiently wide . in figure  [ fig:4cases ] , for example , the initial layer height is @xmath179 in all four cases .",
    "however , in other simulations ( not shown here , but see @xcite for instance ) it has been found that in very narrow domains layers form much earlier , and the initial layer height is smaller .",
    "this result indicates that the horizontally - periodic boundary conditions , which encourage horizontal coherence in the simulation , can artificially accelerate the formation of layers when the domain is sufficiently narrow .",
    "for this reason , we only use data from simulations that were performed in domains of width @xmath94 when calculating the mean fluxes in section  [ sec : measure ] . *",
    "the mean fluxes of heat and composition , for layers of a particular height , are consistent between runs with different domain sizes . * during each layered phase , the cases with wider domains exhibit smaller variations in the value of each flux about its mean value .",
    "this suggests that the variations in the fluxes are horizontally localized , and therefore have less effect on the mean flux in wider domains .",
    "similarly , the simulation in the tallest domain ( of height @xmath99 ) exhibits the smallest variations in the fluxes during each layered phase , because in this simulation the volumetric mean flux represents an average over a greater number of layers and interfaces .",
    "figure  [ fig:4cases ] also illustrates a practical difficulty that arises when comparing results from simulations performed in domains of different heights , which is that simulations in taller domains usually undergo more layered phases than simulations in shorter domains , and the length of each layered phase is correspondingly shorter .",
    "for example , the simulation with a domain height of @xmath99 passes through phases in which the average layer height is @xmath180 and @xmath181 ; these states can not be achieved in the simulations with a domain height of @xmath89 . as a result , the time series of the nusselt numbers in the taller simulation are less obviously step - like , and the mean flux during each layered phase is more difficult to measure accurately .",
    "this also makes it difficult to determine whether the domain height affects the rate at which layers merge .",
    "the full time series of both nusselt numbers from this simulation are shown in figure  [ fig : nu_tall_box]a .",
    "we find that the time between layer merger events increases as the number of layers decreases , which is in accordance with the model of layer merging proposed by @xcite .",
    "another difficulty associated with measuring fluxes in simulations with multiple layers is that the layers are not necessarily all of the same height . in that case ,",
    "a complete description of the state of the system would require ( at least ) measuring the height of each layer , and the jumps in temperature and composition across each interface , potentially introducing many new parameters on which the mean flux might depend . furthermore , in such cases we would not expect the system to be in statistical equilibrium , and so the mean flux might not be well defined . to avoid",
    "dealing with this additional complexity , in this study we assume that , in each layered phase , all the layers have approximately the same height , while recognizing that this assumption introduces an additional source of error into our flux measurements ."

    "<S> oscillatory double - diffusive convection is closely related to the phenomenon known as `` semi - convection , '' but the latter is often also associated with the effects of convective overshoot and the dependence of thermal diffusivity on composition , neither of which are included in this study . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we consider a localized region away from any radiative  convective boundary , in which the thermal and compositional diffusivities can be approximated as constant , and we study the instability and turbulence arising from the competition between thermal and compositional stratification . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we refer to convection in this situation as `` oscillatory double - diffusive ( odd ) convection . ''    </S>",
    "<S> the linear instability mechanism that leads to odd convection can be understood from physical arguments . in the absence of thermal and compositional diffusion , </S>",
    "<S> vertically displaced parcels of fluid oscillate adiabatically about their equilibrium position with a frequency determined by the total density stratification . </S>",
    "<S> but the presence of diffusive processes can amplify the oscillation , producing an instability that resembles an overstable internal gravity wave @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if the thermal diffusivity is sufficiently large in comparison with the compositional diffusivity , then a displaced parcel will acquire heat ( and therefore entropy ) while below its equilibrium position , and thus will be slightly more buoyant than its surroundings when it returns to its equilibrium position . </S>",
