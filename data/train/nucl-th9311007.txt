    "currently a large variety of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials exist . despite the fact that all these potentials were designed to more or less reproduce the deuteron properties and the low - energy nn scattering data",
    ", they are quite different in details . in particular",
    ", the deuteron @xmath3-state percentage given by different potentials ranges from 4.4% for bonn a @xcite to 7.0% for hamada - johnson @xcite .",
    "exact ( or nearly exact ) calculations for the @xmath4=3 and @xmath4=4 systems @xcite show that there is a strong correlation between the tensor strength of the one - boson - exchange nn potential and the binding energy .",
    "the nn potential which has a weaker tensor strength tends to yield a larger binding energy .    in ref.@xcite , however , it is found that when the nn potentials with different parametrizations are optimally fitted ( with @xmath5 per datum about 1 ) to the phase - shifts obtained in the `` new and comprehensive ( energy - dependent ) partial - wave analysis '' , they result in nearly identical triton properties .",
    "it is pointed out that the tensor force is tightly constrained by the mixing parameter @xmath6 , which can be determined very well in their multi - energy analysis .",
    "for example , three local nn potentials , nijmii , reid93 and av18 with parameters newly determined by their fit , have deuteron @xmath3-state percentages of 5.64% , 5.70% and 5.65% respectively .",
    "it is the main purpose of this work to find out whether or not the above observation made in the study of the @xmath4=3 system also holds for larger nuclei . to this end",
    ", we will perform nuclear shell - model ( sm ) calculations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 using effective interactions derived from the reid93 and nijmii potentials . to set a scale for the comparison",
    ", the same calculations will be performed using the hamada - johnson hard - core potential ( h - j ) @xcite and the original reid - soft - core potential ( rsc ) @xcite , both of which were widely used in nuclear - structure calculations in the past .",
    "we will adopt a no - core model space @xcite for which the effective interaction can reasonably be approximated by the brueckner g - matrix @xcite evaluated at appropriate starting energies .",
    "this avoids the difficulty encountered in doing the infinite summation over the core - polarization diagrams for the effective interaction in the presence of an inert core .",
    "of course , for each nucleus , the effective interactions will be calculated in exactly the same manner so the difference reflected in the nuclear sm results is solely due to the difference in the nn potentials .",
    "the brueckner g - matrix @xcite is calculated according to the following equation using the technique developed in ref.@xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the starting energy , @xmath9 is the nn potential , @xmath10 is the single - particle hamiltonian with the one - body mean field @xmath11 approximated by a shifted harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential @xmath12 : @xmath13 the parameter @xmath14 approximately represents the depth of the mean field @xmath11 in which the two nucleons in the ladder - scattering processes are moving .",
    "this parameter can be absorbed into the starting energy by writing the g - matrix equation ( [ g ] ) as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for the two - body g - matrix element @xmath18 , the shifted starting energy @xmath19 is taken as @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the ho single - particle energies : @xmath22 roughly speaking , the quantity @xmath23 represents the interaction energy of the two nucleons bound by the ho potential .",
    "it is negative and depends on the two - nucleon state . in this work",
    ", @xmath23 is regarded as an adjustable parameter whose value will be so chosen that we obtain a reasonable binding energy .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath23 will only be adjusted when we go from one nucleus to another ; its value is fixed when we consider the same nucleus but different nn potentials .",
    "we chose @xmath24 mev , @xmath25 mev for @xmath4=6 and @xmath26 mev , @xmath27 mev for @xmath4=14 .    in the no - core model space ,",
    "the starting - energy independent two - body effective interaction is simply the sum of ladder diagrams ( g - matrix ) plus the folded diagrams .",
    "when the starting energy for the g - matrix is properly chosen , the folded diagrams have a small contribution to the effective interaction , which can , therefore , be well approximated by the g - matrix alone .",
    "since we will be performing a @xmath2 calculation , the pauli operator @xmath28 is defined as ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the principal quantum numbers for the two single - particle orbitals of the intermediate states in the ladder diagrams ) : @xmath31 namely , in the ladder diagrams , the scattering into a two - particle state with @xmath32 is forbidden because these states will be included in the @xmath2 calculation .",
    "in addition , for @xmath0 , the scattering into a two - particle state with one particle in the @xmath33 orbit is also forbidden because the @xmath33 orbit is mostly occupied . for @xmath1 , the scattering into a two - particle state with one particle in the @xmath33 or @xmath34 orbits",
    "is not allowed for the same reason .",
    "this is also shown in fig.1 .",
    "notice that in fig.1 we have cut off the `` wings '' which extend out from the mostly occupied orbitals , at a large enough @xmath35 , so as to obtain a converged result .",
    "it should be pointed out that our treatment of the pauli operator @xmath28 is not exact ; a more accurate definition is possible .",
    "such a definition should be reasonable enough to allow us to do sensible calculations and meaningful comparisons . here",
    "a more important issue is that the effective interactions for different potentials are calculated in exactly the same way .",
    "once the g matrices are obtained , the hamiltonian for the sm calculation is written as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the center - of - mass ( cm ) kinetic energy and @xmath38 is the ho cm hamiltonian .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is taken to be large enough ( @xmath40 ) to force the cm motion into its lowest configuration for all the low - lying states .",
    "our calculations are performed using the oxbash sm code @xcite .",
    "the results for the ground - state energy , the low - lying positive - parity energy spectrum , and selected electromagnetic ( em ) static and transitional properties in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown in table i for the four nn potentials used in this work .",
    "the deuteron @xmath3-state percentage @xmath41 for each potential is also listed .",
    "before we proceed to discuss the results , it should be emphasized that our calculations involve some parameters , such as @xmath23 and @xmath42 .",
    "the calculated ground - state energy , which is quite sensitive to the choice of these parameters , should not be taken as an accurate result .",
    "nevertheless , since we perform exactly the same calculation for different potentials , the results are valid for the purpose of comparisons .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the reid93 and nijmii potentials have been shown to give almost the same results for the triton by solving the faddeev equation @xcite .",
    "it is evident from table i that the effective interactions calculated from these potentials also produce remarkably similar results for the more complex @xmath4=6 and 14 systems .",
    "this is more obvious when we compare the results for these two potentials with those for the h - j and rsc potentials .",
    "note that the similarity between the reid93 and nijmii results lies not only in the bulk properties , such as the binding energy , but also in more subtle observables , like excitation energies and em transition rates .",
    "the latter reflects the equivalence in the wave functions for these two interactions .",
    "it is then safe to conclude that the reid93 and nijmii potentials are not only equivalent in describing the @xmath4=2 and 3 systems as shown in ref.@xcite , they are also equivalent for the larger systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 studied in this work .    for the @xmath4=3 and @xmath4=4 systems , it has been found that there is a strong correlation between the nuclear binding energy and the strength of the tensor component in the nn potential , characterized by the deuteron @xmath3-state percentage @xmath41 @xcite",
    "apparently , the above correlation persists for the more complex nuclei @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a truncated - space sm calculation , as performed here .",
    "the calculated binding energies for the hj and rsc potentials , which have larger deuteron @xmath3-state percentages , are much smaller than those for the reid93 and nijmii potentials .    note , however , that not all nuclear - structure properties are sensitive to the details of the nn potential . by examining table i",
    ", one can see that the _ excitation _ energies for the low - lying states and some em observables for different nn potentials are actually quite similar .",
    "this makes it difficult to test the nn potential in a nucleus by studying nuclear structure .    on the other hand , besides the binding energy , there do exist a few observables which have a strong dependence on one or more particular components of the nn potential .",
    "two famous examples are the isospin splitting between the energies of the @xmath43 , @xmath44=0 and @xmath43 , @xmath44=1 states in @xmath45 and the gamow - teller strength @xmath46 between the ground state in @xmath47 and @xmath1 .",
    "the former is sensitive to the tensor component in the nn potential @xcite and the latter is sensitive to the spin - orbit and tensor components @xcite .",
    "these have been studied in great detail in @xcite . in table",
    "i , one does see a sizable change in the @xmath46 value from the ground state of @xmath47 , when going from one potential to the other .",
    "the @xmath48 value is closely related to the @xmath46 value and also shows some change .",
    "however , both the @xmath46 and @xmath48 values are not a monotonic function of @xmath41 , suggesting that besides the tensor force strength , other differences between the four nn potentials also play a role .    from table",
    "i , we see that the calculated quadrupole moment for the ground state of @xmath0 also experiences quite significant changes when the nn potential is altered . in our truncated - space sm calculation with bare operators [ i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , none of the nn potentials yields the experimental result . the smallness of the experimental quadrupole moment for @xmath0 and of the @xmath46 value from @xmath47 seems to indicate that in a truncated sm calculation",
    ", one needs a weaker tensor force .",
    "this is consistent with the observations made in ref.@xcite , where some other quantities which are sensitive to the tensor force were considered .",
    "in this work , we perform a no - core space @xmath2 sm calculation for the @xmath4=6 and 14 systems using effective interactions calculated from four different nn potentials .",
    "the reid93 and nijmii potentials , which were found to be equivalent in the description of the @xmath4=2 and @xmath4=3 systems , are shown to yield almost identical results , not only for the binding energy , but also for the energy spectrum and the em static and transitional properties for the larger nuclei considered in this work .",
    "it is verified that the nn potential with a weaker tensor component ( i.e. , smaller deuteron @xmath3-state percentage ) tends to give a larger nuclear binding energy , consistent with the observations made in the study of the smaller @xmath4=3 and 4 systems .",
    "many nuclear - structure properties are found to be rather insensitive to the details of a nn potential and similar results are obtained for them , when different nn potentials are used .    among the various observables",
    "considered , there are a few which are sensitive to the various components of a nn potential , in particular , the tensor force . in order to reproduce the experimental results for the gt transition strength from the ground state of @xmath47 and the quadrupole moment of @xmath0 in a truncated space sm calculation , a weaker tensor force is needed .",
