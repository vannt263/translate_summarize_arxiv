    "networks with at least one ring structure ( hamiltonian cycle ) are called loop networks . distributed loop networks are extensions of ring networks and are widely used in the design and implementation of local area networks and parallel processing architectures .",

    "an open problem considered in a survey @xmath17 on distributed loop networks is following : find hamiltonian networks , @xmath1-regular on @xmath0 vertices with a diameter of order @xmath18 .",
    "this problem is related to the famous @xmath19 problem in which we want to construct a graph of @xmath0 vertices with maximum degree @xmath1 such that the diameter @xmath13 is minimized , but hamiltonicity is not an issue .",

    "it is shown in @xmath26 that a cubic graph obtained by adding a random perfect matching to a cycle has a diameter of order @xmath2 . in the same paper ,",

    "we describe the linear algorithm and prove that it produces hamiltonian graphs of degree at most  @xmath1 and diameter at most @xmath36 . in section 3",
    "we deal with the case @xmath37 and improve the upper bound for the number of edges in the resulting graph to @xmath38 .",
    "the same approach may be applied for @xmath39 and this way we get a hamiltonian graph with the average degree asymptotically equal to @xmath40 . in the end , we show that the algorithm may be modified in such a way that it constructs a planar hamiltonian graph with degree at most @xmath1 and diameter at most @xmath4 and also point out some experimental results for diameter when @xmath37 .",
    "a complete binary tree is a tree with @xmath0 levels , where for each level @xmath41 , the number of the existing nodes at level @xmath42 equals @xmath43 .",
    "this means that all possible nodes exist at these levels .",
    "an additional requirement for a complete binary tree is that for the @xmath0-th level , while not all nodes have to exist , the nodes that do exist must fill the level from left to right ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "a complete binary tree is one of the most important architectures for interconnection networks @xcite .",
    "a generalization of binary trees are @xmath1-ary trees .",
    "namely , every vertex has at most @xmath44 children , and all vertices that are not in the last level have exactly @xmath44 children .",
    "all vertices in the last level must occupy the leftmost spots consecutively .",
    "we propose the following algorithm for constructing hamiltonian graphs of order @xmath0 , maximum degree @xmath1 and diameter @xmath45 .",
    "first we construct a complete @xmath1-ary tree with @xmath0 vertices , and for every vertex we store its degree , parent , and all children from left to right .",
    "a labeled @xmath1-ary tree contains labels @xmath16 through @xmath0 with root being @xmath16 , branches leading to nodes labeled @xmath46 , branches from these leading to @xmath47 , and so on .",
    "we also maintain a queue of all leaves .",
    "@xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 add edge @xmath51 @xmath52    we will traverse vertices in order to form a hamiltonian cycle .",
    "the starting vertex is the root of the tree .",
    "first we try to go up the tree through the parent of the current vertex - if the parent is already visited , we choose one of its children . in the case",
    "where all neighbors of the current vertex are marked , we pick an arbitrary unmarked leaf and add an edge connecting these two vertices .",
    "[ th-2.1 ] a graph constructed by the above algorithm is hamiltonian .    the basic idea of the algorithm is to traverse the hamiltonian path by adding edges when they are needed .",
    "in the end , we join the last visited vertex to the root of the binary tree",
    ". there can be at most one vertex other than the root with a degree greater than @xmath16 and less than @xmath1 in the tree - let this vertex have the label @xmath53 .",
    "all edges that we add during the execution of the algorithm connect either two leaves or a leaf and @xmath53 . by symmetry",
    ", we can eliminate the vertex @xmath53 by traversing from the root to @xmath53 in the first few steps of the algorithm .",
    "therefore , this algorithm does not increase the maximum degree @xmath1 in the graph .",
    "we can not visit any vertex twice , so we have to prove that all vertices are marked .",
    "assume that the vertex @xmath10 is not visited and the algorithm has finished .",
    "if any vertex in its subtree is visited , then we would have already visited  @xmath10 , because we first try to go upwards .",
    "therefore , all vertices in its subtree are unvisited",
    ". there is at least one leaf in the subtree , and we have to visit this leaf during the execution of the algorithm .",
    "this is a contradiction , so the constructed graph is hamiltonian .",
    "the diameter of this graph is less than or equal to twice the depth of the tree . @xmath54",
    "the number of leaves @xmath55 in a complete @xmath1-ary tree is @xmath56    we know that @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "whenever we properly add @xmath44 vertices to this tree , we always get exactly @xmath60 new leaves .",
    "this proves the recurrent relation for the number of leaves @xmath61    by mathematical induction , one can easily prove the explicit formula for  @xmath55 .",
    "the number of edges in the constructed graph is less than @xmath62 .",
    "there are @xmath63 edges in a @xmath1-regular graph .",
    "the internal nodes in a @xmath1-ary tree are nodes with degree greater than one . after running the algorithm , every leaf will have degree at most three and every internal node will have degree at most @xmath1 .",
    "this gives an upper bound for the number of edges in the hamiltonian graph constructed by the algorithm : @xmath64    this bound is less than @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and less than @xmath67 if @xmath68 and the depth of the tree is greater than  two .",
    "based on this fact , we give the following    time and memory complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear @xmath69 . @xmath70",
    "cubic graphs are of special interest in token ring topologies and because of their importance , in this section we improve the previous estimations for the number of edges added in the construction of a hamiltonian path for the case @xmath37 .",
    "first we examine graphs with @xmath72 vertices , where @xmath73 .",
    "a corresponding binary tree has complete last level and there are @xmath74 leaves in the tree .",
    "let @xmath75 be the number of additional edges added to this tree , when we start the execution of the algorithm in an arbitrary leaf and end it in another leaf .",
    "one can easily verify that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , we define @xmath78 . after traversing upwards to the root and",
    "then downwards to an arbitrary leaf , the graph induced by the unvisited vertices are disjoint complete binary trees of heights @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , we may write the recurrent formula : @xmath80    by strong induction we will prove that : @xmath81    assume that the formula holds for all numbers @xmath82 , and now we will prove it for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "f ( 2k ) & = 2 ( 2k - 1 ) + 2 _ i = 0^k - 1 f ( 2i ) + 2 _ i = 1^k - 1 f ( 2i - 1 ) = 4k - 2 + _ i = 0 ^ 2k - 2 2^i - ( 3k - 2 ) = ( 2 ^ 2k - 1 ) . + f ( 2k + 1 ) & = 2 ( 2k + 1 - 1 ) + 2 _ i = 0^k - 1 f ( 2i ) + 2 _ i = 1^k f ( 2i - 1 ) = 4k + _ i = 0 ^ 2k - 1 2^i - 3k = ( 2 ^ 2k + 1 - 2 ) .    to estimate the actual number of additional edges in the proposed algorithm we have to start from the root and add an additional edge connecting the last visited vertex and the root of the binary tree . after visiting the first leaf we have that the unvisited vertices form disjoint complete binary trees of heights @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "so , the total number of edges to be added equals : @xmath87    therefore , we proved the following result .",
    "the number of additional edges in the case of a complete binary tree with @xmath28 vertices does not depend on the choice of random leaves in the algorithm and this number equals @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath70    now assume that @xmath0 is not of the form @xmath89 .",
    "the main result in this section is the following theorem .    for every integer @xmath90",
    ", there exists a hamiltonian graph with diameter at most @xmath4 , maximum degree @xmath5 and at most @xmath91 edges .",
    "the number of leaves in a corresponding binary tree with @xmath0 vertices is @xmath92 .",
    "some leaves are on the last level , and some are on the level before last .",
    "consider the consecutive leaves in the last level starting from the left and group them into groups of size four .",
    "this way we get subtrees of height two and there can be at most three unpaired leaves .",
    "we will do the same thing for the leaves in the previous level , but starting from the right .",
    "therefore , the number of subtrees of height two is less than or equal to @xmath93 and greater than @xmath94 . according to the two cases in figure [ tree4 ]",
    ", there can be two or three leaves in each of these subtrees that will get and keep degree two until the algorithm finishes .",
    "thus , the number of edges we do not have to add equals half the number of vertices of degree two , and it is between @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the total number of edges in the constructed graph after running the algorithm will be between @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "after the hamiltonian cycle is constructed , we may insert additional edges into the graph to make it cubic , provided @xmath0 is even .    for the case @xmath39",
    ", one can construct a hamiltonian graph with at most @xmath99 edges .",
    "the same approach may be applied to complete binary subtrees of greater heights to obtain a slightly finer bound for the total number of edges .",
    "the proposed algorithm may be modified to construct a planar hamiltonian graph .      in order to prove the theorem",
    ", we will construct a hamiltonian path that starts at the leftmost leaf and ends in the nearest leaf ( neighboring leaf or leaf that is at distance three from it ) . for small values of @xmath0 , this can be easily verified . in the general case",
    "we first go upwards to the root and then to the rightmost leaf .",
    "now , the @xmath1-ary tree is partitioned into smaller trees , which will be traversed by induction from left to right .",
    "these binary trees do not have vertices in common , and we can independently add necessary edges which do not intersect the existing edges .",
    "we reduce our problem to the previous case by going to the leftmost leaf .",
    "now we have disjoint trees and we traverse them starting from the leaves . finally , we add the last edge without intersection problems ( as in figure  [ example ] ) .    for the case @xmath37 , in our implementation we always choose a leaf that is farthest from the current leaf .",
    "this heuristic is done by the breadth first search .",
    "we use only three arrays of length @xmath0 , so memory requirements are linear in @xmath0 .",
    "time complexity is @xmath100 , because the number of edges is @xmath101 .",
    "the diameters of the examples of cubic graphs constructed by this algorithm are shown in figure [ graphics ] , where the @xmath102-axis carries @xmath103 and @xmath0 is the number of nodes .",
    "it is obvious from this figure that the constant  @xmath104 from our bound is not the best possible .    instead of choosing the leaves at random",
    ", we can do it more sophisticatedly and further reduce the diameter of the graph .",
    "one possible way is to add a matching which connects only the leaves on the last level in the root s left and right subtree . this way we can still apply the algorithm , but if we have to choose a random leaf to continue ",
    "we first check whether the paired leaf in the matching is marked .",
    "this way we decrease the diameter by a constant , which is at least one .",
    "we leave for future study to see whether this approach may be used to construct @xmath16-edge hamiltonian graphs .",
