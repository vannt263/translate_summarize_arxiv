    "quantum hall states are remarkable physical systems because they are topologically ordered phases of matter .",
    "non - abelian topological phases , which possess quasiparticles whose exchange statistics are described by multi - dimensional representations of the braid group  @xcite , have recently attracted much attention due to their potential use as a naturally fault - tolerant medium for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "a number of non - abelian quantum hall states have been proposed as likely candidates for the second landau level platueaus  @xcite .",
    "the second landau level quantum hall states have been the focus of many recent experiments , including ones that have provided evidence in support of a non - abelian state at @xmath0  @xcite .    clearly , it is important to have experimental tests that can accurately identify and distinguish the topological order physically realized in a quantum hall system . a class of experiments proposed in refs",
    ".   for such purposes is the coulomb blockade experiments . in these experiments ,",
    "a region of the quantum hall liquid is effectively pinched off on two sides from the rest of the liquid , forming an isolated puddle .",
    "( such a configuration may unintentionally occur when attempting to implement a double point - contact interferometer , such as those used for interference experiments .",
    "however , this appears not to be the case in the experiments of ref .  .",
    ") in such a configuration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : blockage ] ) , most of the edge current will flow from one edge to the other at the pinched regions . however , some of the current can flow from one end of the hall bar to the other as a result of electrons tunneling to and from the puddle , across the pinched off regions where the hall liquid does not exist .",
    "generically , such electron tunneling will be energetically prohibited by the charging energy of the puddle .",
    "however , there will be tunneling resonances when the ground - state energies are degenerate for two different values of @xmath1 , the number of electrons in the pinched - off puddle . by varying the area of the puddle",
    ", one will pass through a series of such resonances , the spacing of which is determined by the properties of the particular quantum hall state .    .",
    "these resonance patterns will depend on the total topological charge of the quasiparticles ( red dots ) contained in the puddle . ]    in this paper , we study the signatures of quantum hall states in the coulomb blockade experiments , demonstrating through general arguments and specific examples that this class of experiments does not provide a very discerning probe of topological order .",
    "specifically , we write the general expression for the spacing between tunneling resonance peaks in a simple form which allows the predictions of this experimental signature to be obtained with only knowledge of the fusion rules and the conformal scaling dimensions of the edge modes of the candidate states . from this , we demonstrate that generally any quantum hall state can have a coulomb blockade doppelgnger  a dramatically different quantum hall state at the same filling fraction with identical coulomb blockade signatures .",
    "this was first noticed while examining @xmath0 candidates in ref .  , where it was shown that the abelian @xmath2 state  @xcite ( without spin / component symmetry breaking ) has the same coulomb blockade pattern as the non - abelian moore - read ( mr )  @xcite , anti - pfaffian ( @xmath3 )  @xcite , and su@xmath4 non - abelian fractional quantum hall ( naf )  @xcite states . in this paper , we examine all the strong candidate quantum hall states and find doppelgngers for most of them .",
    "furthermore , we show that nearly all of the viable candidates for the observed second landau level filling fractions are coulomb blockade doppelgngers of each other ( at a given filling ) .",
    "in the general setting , coulomb blockade experiments allow one to probe correlations in a strongly - interacting system by the means of single electron tunneling through a quantum dot via two tunnel junctions  @xcite .",
    "one then expects to see resonant tunneling peaks , as a function of some external parameters , whenever the energy of the isolated dot with @xmath5 and @xmath6 electrons is degenerate , @xmath7 . in the quantum hall regime",
    ", one can envision several experimental settings . in general",
    ", there may be several edge channels surrounding incompressible regions at different filling fractions .",
    "the aforementioned `` dot '' need not be fully isolated since not all edge channels are necessarily pinched off at the tunnel junctions .",
    "furthermore , the pinched - off region may itself contain compressible regions  @xcite .    to avoid ambiguity",
    ", we focus here on the case where the bulk of the sample is in the quantum hall state at a filling fraction @xmath8 . the entire edge structure",
    "then consists of @xmath9 outer integer quantum hall channels ( separated by the incompressible strips ) and the innermost fractional quantum hall edge corresponding to a @xmath10 state .",
    "we assume that only the innermost edge separating the incompressible regions with filling fractions of @xmath9 and @xmath8 is pinched off at the gated constrictions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : blockage ] . the integer quantum hall channels that propagate past these constrictions",
    "are not shown in the figure .",
    "we consider the case where the pinched off puddle region contains incompressible hall fluid .",
    "the puddle can contain a number of quasiparticle excitations , however the energy gap to their creation is assumed large comparing to the typical charging energies ( this is just a restatement of the incompressible nature of the puddle ) . for the purpose of this treatment , we envision the experimentally tunable external parameters are the uniform background magnetic field and the voltage applied to the side gate @xmath11 , which changes the equilibrium area of the puddle @xmath12 .",
    "the isolated nature of the puddle guarantees that it contains an integer number of electrons  this is a conventional coulomb blockade setting .",
    "we contrast this situation with the recently emerged notion of `` coulomb domination ''  @xcite whereby the coulomb energy of the puddle can be the dominant energy even when the puddle is far from being pinched off from the rest of the hall fluid . in the coulomb - dominated regime ,",
    "the number of electrons in the puddle is determined by the condition that they exactly neutralize the positively charged background , but need not be quantized .    to translate the resonant tunneling condition @xmath7 ( where the energy is predominantly coulombic ) to our setting",
    ", we notice that the electron number can only change by one whenever the gate voltage is increased by enough to allow one additional electron into or out of the puddle . at this point",
    ", there is a peak in the longitudinal conductance ( which are also peaks in the longitudinal resistance , since @xmath13 ) since it is only at this point ( or rather within @xmath14 of it ) that the charge on the puddle can fluctuate .",
    "since the density in the puddle is fixed , the spacing between peaks as a function of area is naively just the additional area required to allow one more electron into the puddle : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the charge density inside the dot .",
    "this consideration , however , is too simplistic as it misses the quantum mechanical nature of the edge .",
    "specifically , the edge modes need to satisfy certain boundary conditions that are consistent with their quantum numbers . in order to incorporate this physics into our treatment ,",
    "we follow ref .   and write the energy of a charged edge as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the puddle circumference and @xmath19 is the magnetic flux quantum . here @xmath20 is the chiral bosonic field describing the edge charge mode ; the corresponding linear charge density is given by @xmath21 .",
    "this description , however , does not capture the entire edge physics of systems which have more than just such a charge mode . for general quantum hall states , one also needs to account for a kinetic energy of neutral edge modes . to do so",
    ", we turn to a more formal description of excitations in the quantum hall systems of interest .",
    "anyonic quasiparticles carry conserved quantum numbers called topological charge , which obey the fusion rules @xmath22 corresponding to the topological order of the state , where the fusion coefficients @xmath23 specify the number of ways charge @xmath24 and @xmath25 can combine to produce charge @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are non - abelian charges , then @xmath27 .",
    "the bulk of the pinched - off puddle will have some definite total collective topological charge @xmath28 determined by @xmath1 together with the topological charge of an electron @xmath29 , and the total topological charge @xmath30 of the bulk quasiparticle excitations in the puddle .",
    "since electrons are abelian , @xmath31 is uniquely specified given a definite value of @xmath30 .",
    "if the bulk quasiparticles are all abelian , then @xmath32 is also uniquely specified , where @xmath33 indexes the bulk quasiparticles and @xmath34 is the topological charge of the @xmath35 bulk quasiparticle .",
    "when the bulk quasiparticles are non - abelian , there can be multiple fusion channels , and so we write @xmath36 to indicate that @xmath30 is one of the allowed fusion channels of the quasiparticles . in this case , @xmath30 will still have a definite value , since the puddle is isolated .",
    "the entire puddle must have trivial total topological charge @xmath37 , so , to compensate for the bulk topological charge @xmath31 , the edge of the puddle carries the conjugate topological charge @xmath38 .",
    "this topological charge determines which sectors of edge excitations are allowed to occur , and hence the energy spectrum of the edge excitations .",
    "thus , the pattern of tunneling resonance peaks is determined by the ground - state energy @xmath39 of the puddle  @xcite , which depends on the number of electrons @xmath1 in the puddle , the background magnetic field @xmath40 , the puddle area @xmath12 , and the collective topological charge @xmath31 of the bulk .",
    "the edge of a quantum hall fluid can be described using conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite . for a pure cft on a circle of length @xmath18 ,",
    "the energy of a @xmath41 level descendent of the primary field @xmath20 is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the velocity and @xmath44 is the conformal scaling dimension of @xmath20 . for a quantum hall system",
    ", there can be multiple edge modes , and the topological charge @xmath45 on the edge determines which primary field @xmath46 of the @xmath47 mode is present .",
    "for this analysis , we are interested in the ground - state energies , and can ignore descendents ( let @xmath48 ) . some of the edge modes may couple to other quantities that break their conformal symmetry . we can thus write the energy as the sum over effective energies from the edge modes @xmath49 where @xmath18 is the length of the puddle s perimeter , @xmath50 is the velocity of the @xmath47 mode , and @xmath51 is the effective scaling dimension of the @xmath47 edge mode .",
    "the effective scaling dimensions include any modification of these modes that arise when the cft couples to other quantities . when there is no modification of an edge mode , one simply has @xmath52 , the conformal scaling dimension of @xmath53 .",
    "for example , the charge sector s conformal dimension of an excitation with electric charge @xmath54 is given by @xmath55^{2}= \\frac{1 } { 2 \\tilde{\\nu } } \\left ( \\frac{e^{\\ast}}{e } \\right)^{2 } .\\ ] ] however , we include the electrostatic area dependence in the energy of the charge mode ( denoted @xmath26 ) by writing  @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the area of the puddle with just enough quasiholes fewer than the given configuration in order to have @xmath58 ( see refs .   for more clarifying details ) , and only the fractional part of the filling @xmath59 , enters the expression because the fully filled landau levels are treated as inert .    the expression in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : htilde_h],[eq : htilde_a ] ) can be written somewhat more transparently as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the quantized number of fluxes ascribed to the electrons ( which have @xmath62 flux per electron ) and bulk quasiparticles ( the @xmath35 quasiparticle having @xmath63 fluxes ) , @xmath64 is a finite ( not necessarily integer - valued ) shift , and @xmath65 is the actual number of magnetic fluxes through the puddle . in this form",
    ", the energy is seen to be due to the discrepancy between the actual number of fluxes through the puddle and the flux quantization condition .",
    "alternatively , we can translate flux to charge and think of this as the energy cost for violating charge neutrality . from this",
    ", we can see that without the inclusion of neutral modes the spacing between resonance peaks would simply be @xmath66 , the average area that a single electron occupies",
    ". however , the internal structures of a quantum hall state can give rise to deviations from this simple behavior through the neutral modes . in order to determine this deviant behavior",
    ", one must track how the topological charges of the neutral modes change as electrons are added to and removed from the puddle .",
    "the spacing between two tunneling resonance peaks , for example the resonance when @xmath67 and the resonance when @xmath7 , which has the corresponding sequence of total topological charge of the puddle : @xmath68 will be given by @xmath69 assuming that @xmath70 do not depend on @xmath12 for @xmath71 .",
    "( [ eq : da],[eq : delta2h ] ) are general , yet simple expressions which allow one to easily predict the coulomb blockade spacings for candidate quantum hall states . to compute the coulomb blockade resonance peak patters from these equations ,",
    "one only needs a cursory understanding of cft .",
    "specifically , one only needs to know the fusion rules , the conformal dimensions of the different topological sectors , and the topological charge carried by the electrons .",
    "when there is a single neutral sector , e.g. when there is only one neutral mode or when the neutral modes have equilibrated into a single sector with common velocity @xmath72 , this becomes @xmath73 in the following examples , we will always assume the simplest case where all the neutral modes of a state have equilibrated , and use these equations .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the neutral modes may not be fully equilibrated , in which case one would still have to use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : da],[eq : delta2h ] ) with multiple neutral velocities .",
    "we note that neutral mode velocities are typically expected to be small compared to the charge mode velocity .",
    "for example , the experimental studies of refs .   found @xmath74 for the @xmath0 state .",
    "clearly , this would make it experimentally challenging to resolve the deviations of the resonance peak spacings from the trivial spacing @xmath75 .",
    "when there are non - trivial electrically neutral excitations in a quantum hall state , there will generally be tunneling of such excitations between the edge and the bulk quasiparticles that will not change the bulk energy , but may lower the edge energy .",
    "if the area of the puddle is changed slowly compared to the tunneling rate of such neutral excitations ( which is governed by the distance of bulk quasiparticles from the edge ) , then the spacing between consecutive resonance peaks will be modified because the total topological charge on the edge ( and in the bulk ) will change as a result of the tunneling event .",
    "we emphasize that while such bulk - edge relaxation generally can occur for non - abelian quantum hall states , it can also occur for certain abelian states as well .    for the resulting spacing when bulk - edge relaxation occurs  @xcite , one replaces @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : da ] ) with @xmath77 where the primed topological charges are the ones that result after electron tunneling before relaxation has occurred , and the unprimed topological charges are the ones that result after relaxation has occurred while the puddle area is being increased , i.e. when the topological charge advances through the sequence of relaxation and electron tunneling @xmath78 ( @xmath79 and @xmath6 would be interchanged if the puddle area were being decreased ) . when the area of the puddle is changed quickly compared to the neutral excitation bulk - edge tunneling rate , the spacing will simply look like eq .",
    "( [ eq : da ] ) . for intermediate time scales ,",
    "the spacing between consecutive resonance peaks will be given by some smearing between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : delta2h ] ) and ( [ eq : delta2h ] ) . bulk - edge relaxation generally has the effect of decreasing the visibility of bunching in the resonance peak patterns .      in the above analysis",
    ", it was assumed that the quasiparticle content of the puddle remains fixed while the area of the puddle is changed .",
    "this , of course , need not be the case . for example , a quasiparticle could be pinned at an impurity site which passes from the inside to the outside of the puddle as its boundary is moved in the process of changing its area . when the quasiparticle content of the puddle is changed in the course of the experiment",
    ", the observed coulomb blockade resonance peak pattern will switch between patterns corresponding to different total topological charge @xmath30 of the quasiparticles contained in the puddle ( and hence of different total topological charge @xmath80 of the puddle ) .",
    "when there are multiple `` flavors '' of electrons ( e.g. in multi - layer or spin unpolarized systems ) , one generalizes the above discussion in the obvious way .",
    "specifically , each flavor of electron has a particular topological charge assigned to it , which generally differs from one another .",
    "consequently , the additional or removal of an electron of a particular flavor may be energetically preferred or disfavored for a given configuration of the system .",
    "such an energetic preference must be taken into account when determining the sequence of topological charge as electrons are added to or removed from the puddle , and hence of the spacing between resonance peaks .",
    "when there is non - uniform filling , e.g. for hierarchical states exhibiting a layered edge structure , one must treat each region of given filling fraction separately .",
    "consequently , one has a distinct copy of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : da],[eq : delta2h ] ) for each edge separating two regions of different filling , with @xmath59 now equal to the difference in filling fractions between these two regions",
    ". however , in such a scenario with multiple regions of different filling and multiple edges , there is _ a priori _ no relation between the areas of the different regions , since these are non - universal properties that will depend on system details .",
    "because of this , it is difficult to make meaningful predictions regarding the resulting tunneling resonance patterns that arise for states with non - uniform filling .",
    "at first , one might naively think that the spacing patterns of coulomb blockade tunneling resonance peaks should be rather distinctive signatures of the topological order of the system , since they are determined by the corresponding fusion rules and conformal scaling dimensions , which are in fact highly distinctive properties .",
    "however , a bit more thought reveals the fallacies of this reasoning : first of all , it is only a very restricted set of fusion rules that apply in this setting , i.e. repeated fusion with the abelian topological charge carried by electrons ; secondly , the conformal dimensions do not enter the expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : da ] ) in a simple way , but rather do so in the combinations given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : delta2h],[eq : delta2h ] ) . from this , it is clear that quantum hall states with dramatically different topological orders and braiding statistics ( or , more specifically , even with dramatically different fusion rules and conformal scaling dimensions ) can nonetheless give rise to coulomb blockade patterns that are identical .",
    "this complication goes beyond the experimental challenges which may make different states difficult to distinguishable via coulomb blockade experiments , such as insufficient resolution , the likely small values of @xmath81 , and the thermal smearing of resonance peaks .",
    "while these experimental obstacles may in principle be overcome , the indistinguishability of coulomb blockade doppelgngers is an inherent problem which can not be surmounted within this class of experiments .",
    "hence , in contrast to interference experiments , coulomb blockade lacks the ability to unambiguously identify even the presence of non - abelian statistics in a quantum hall state .",
    "having established simple methods which allow us to easily compute the coulomb blockade tunneling resonance peak patterns , we now turn to the important examples of candidate quantum hall states .",
    "if a quantum hall state includes an array of abelian u@xmath82 sectors with coupling @xmath83-matrix , it is useful to separate them into the charge and neutral modes .",
    "this can be done by directly diagonalizing the @xmath83-matrix , or alternatively at the level of the flux vector . in this manner , for an excitation with u@xmath84 flux vector @xmath85",

    "( note : these equations can also be used for electrons by treating them as excitations with @xmath89 , rather than their actual charge @xmath90 . ) the fusion rules of topological charges in such u@xmath82 sectors is given by addition of the flux vectors .",
    "this can apply to hierarchical / composite fermion type states , as considered in the next section , as well as multi - component ( `` component '' can mean layer , flavor , spin , etc . ) states  @xcite .",
    "the haldane - halperin ( hh ) states  @xcite are described by an array of u@xmath82s , and so can be analyzed using their corresponding @xmath83-matrices and charge vectors ( see , e.g. ref  ) , as previously explained ( for hierarchy states , one must remember to identify flux vectors under addition of the electrically neutral bosons in order to produce the smallest conformal dimension ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is cumbersome to apply in complete generality .",
    "however , the subset of these states at the prominent filling fractions @xmath91 , which also admits an equivalent composite fermion ( cf ) description  @xcite , possesses additional symmetry which allows the edge theories to be described by @xmath92 , where the @xmath93 is purely the charge sector and @xmath94 is the neutral sector  @xcite .",

    "we first note that @xmath133 satisfies the property @xmath134 and that permuting the components of a flux vector leaves its conformal dimension unchanged .",
    "this makes it clear that the flux vectors for an arbitrary energetically preferred tunneling sequence is related to the flux vectors @xmath132 through permutation of components and ( multiple ) addition / subtraction of @xmath135 .",

    "such flux vectors will reach ones that can be related to @xmath132 after a few electrons have tunneled .",
    "thus , we see that for an arbitrary configuration of bulk quasiparticles , electron tunneling will give a sequence of flux vectors that is equivalent ( in terms of @xmath133 values ) to @xmath136 and hence the coulomb blockade resonance peak spacing is determined by eq .",
