    "in this paper we consider that the elements from sr through ag in metal - poor stars represent the products of nucleosynthesis in neutrino - driven winds from forming neutron stars .",
    "this approach allows us to obtain information on the stellar sources that contributed to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the galaxy and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at early and recent times .",
    "we previously proposed a phenomenological two - component model ( @xcite ; hereafter qw07 ) to account for the abundances of heavy elements in metal - poor stars .",
    "that model focused on the elements commonly considered to be produced by the generic `` @xmath12-process '' .",
    "it specifically attributed all the elements from sr through ag in metal - poor stars to the charged - particle reactions ( cpr ) in the neutrino - driven winds from nascent neutron stars and used this as a diagnostic of the sources for these cpr elements .",
    "in contrast , the true @xmath12-process elements ( e.g. , ba and higher atomic numbers ) are produced by extensive rapid neutron capture .",
    "it was assumed in the two - component model that fe was only produced by normal supernovae ( sne ) from progenitors of @xmath5@xmath6 , which leave behind neutron stars , and that the heavy @xmath12-process elements ( @xmath12-elements ) with mass numbers @xmath18 were formed in low - mass sne from progenitors of @xmath3@xmath4 , which also leave behind neutron stars but produce no fe .",
    "thus the cpr elements would be produced by both low - mass and normal sne and the corresponding yields were estimated ( qw07 ) .",
    "it follows that if these sne were the only sources , then the presence of fe should always be associated with that of the cpr elements .",
    "a more extensive study of the available observational data shows that some low - metallicity stars have fe but essentially no sr .",
    "in particular , @xcite found a star with @xmath2}=\\log{\\rm ( fe / h)}-\\log{\\rm ( fe / h)}_\\odot=-2.88 $ ] and @xmath19 in the dwarf galaxy draco . from the two - component model",
    "we would have estimated @xmath20 for this star , which is far above the observational upper limit .",
    "these results clearly indicate that if the cpr elements are always produced during the formation of neutron stars , then there must be an additional stellar source contributing fe that does not leave behind neutron stars , or else the above model for the production of the cpr elements is in error .    utilizing a more extensive data base than qw07 and especially treating the data on stars very deficient in sr , y , and zr relative to fe at",
    "@xmath2}<-3 $ ] , the present paper will show that a third source in addition to the two sources ( low - mass and normal sne ) in the model of qw07 is required to account for the elemental abundances in metal - poor stars .",
    "it will be argued that the third source producing fe but no cpr elements is most likely associated with hypernovae ( hne ) from progenitors of @xmath8@xmath9 , which leave behind black holes instead of neutron stars .",
    "it is then shown that essentially all of the stellar data on elemental abundances at @xmath2}\\lesssim -1.5 $ ] can be decomposed in terms of three distinct types of sources .",
    "this decomposition also identifies a yield pattern for the elements from na through zn including fe that is attributable to hne .",
    "an important conclusion is that this hn yield pattern is almost indistinguishable from what is attributed to normal sne .",
    "further , the discovery of extremely energetic hne associated with gamma - ray bursters ( e.g. , @xcite ) in the present universe requires that contributions from this source must be considered both in early epochs and on to the present .",
    "this leads to a reassessment of the contributions from different sources to the galactic fe inventory , which shows that ongoing hne must play an important role and that the usual attribution of @xmath21 of the solar fe inventory to normal sne is not valid .",
    "we aim to present a phenomenological three - component ( low - mass and normal sne and hne ) model for the chemical evolution of the early galaxy that may provide a quantitative , self - consistent explanation for many of the results from stellar observations .",
    "we focus on three groups of elements : the low-@xmath13 elements from na through zn ( @xmath2270 ) , the cpr elements from sr through ag ( @xmath23110 ) , and the heavy @xmath12-elements ( @xmath24 , ba and higher atomic numbers ) . in  [ sec-2 cm ]",
    "we give a brief outline of the two - component model of qw07 with low - mass and normal sne represented by the @xmath25 and @xmath26 sources , respectively . in ",
    "[ sec - data ] we present the data on abundances of sr and ba as well as y and la for a large sample of metal - poor stars , and show that the two - component model fails at @xmath2}\\lesssim -3 $ ] and that an additional source producing fe but no sr or heavier elements is required to account for the data at such low metallicities .",
    "this source is identified with hne .",
    "it is then shown that the extended three - component model with hne , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 sources gives a good representation of nearly all the data on the cpr elements sr , y , and zr , but leads to the conclusion that the hn yield pattern is indistinguishable from that of the @xmath26 source for all the low-@xmath13 elements . considering that hne not only represent the first massive stars ( population iii stars ) but also must continue into the present epoch , we reinterpret the yields attributed to the hypothetical @xmath26 source as the combined contributions from normal sne , which we designate as the @xmath27 source , and hne . in  [ sec-3 cm ] we show that the three - component model with hne , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 sources gives a very good representation of essentially all the data on the cpr elements sr , y , and zr and further discuss the characteristics of these sources and their roles in the chemical evolution of the universe .",

    "it was directed toward identifying the stellar sources for the heavy @xmath12-elements .",
    "the following are the key assumptions and inferences of this model :    \\(1 ) the heavy @xmath12-elements must be produced by an @xmath25 source that contributes essentially none of the low-@xmath13 elements including fe . the @xmath25 source is most likely associated with low - mass sne from progenitors of @xmath3@xmath4 that undergo o - ne - mg core collapse .",
    "\\(2 ) the low-@xmath13 elements are produced by an @xmath26 source associated with normal sne from progentiors of @xmath5@xmath6 that undergo fe core collapse .",
    "( it was assumed that this source provided @xmath21 of the bulk solar fe inventory . )",
    "\\(3 ) the so - called light `` @xmath12''-elements from sr through ag , especially sr , y , and zr , in metal - poor stars must have been produced by cprs in the @xmath1-process @xcite that occurs as material expands away from a nascent neutron star in a neutrino - driven wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the cpr elements are not directly related to the @xmath12-process ( i.e. , they are not the true @xmath12-elements ) . instead , their production is a natural consequence of neutron star formation in low - mass and normal sne associated with the @xmath25 and @xmath26 sources , respectively , as proposed by qw07 .",

    "similarly , there were no significant contributions to sr and heavier elements in the ism of this early regime from the @xmath30-process in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "thus , it was considered in qw07 that for @xmath2}\\lesssim -1.5 $ ] , the @xmath25 source is solely responsible for the heavy @xmath12-elements such as eu and the @xmath26 source is solely responsible for the low-@xmath13 elements such as fe while both sources produce the cpr elements .",
    "the yield pattern for the prototypical @xmath25 source was taken from the data on a star ( cs  22892052 , @xcite ) with extremely high enrichment in the heavy @xmath12-elements relative to the low-@xmath13 elements .",
    "in contrast , the yield pattern for the prototypical @xmath26 source was taken from the data on a star ( hd  122563 , @xcite ) with very little enrichment in the heavy @xmath12-elements relative to the low-@xmath13 elements and the abundances of the latter elements in this star were attributed to the @xmath26 source only . for this two - component model , the ( number ) abundance of an element e in the ism at @xmath2}\\lesssim -1.5 $ ] can be calculated as @xmath31 where ( e / eu)@xmath32 and ( e / fe)@xmath33 are the ( number ) yield ratios of e to eu and fe for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 sources , respectively .",
    "given these yield ratios , the abundances of all the other elements ( relative to hydrogen ) in a star can be obtained from the above equation using only the observed abundances of eu and fe in that star .",
    "the results from the above model were in good agreement with the data on a large sample of metal - poor stars .",
    "we note that so long as there are no significant @xmath30-process contributions to the ism ( which is the case for @xmath2}\\lesssim -1.5 $ ] ) or the star has not undergone mass transfer from an agb companion in a binary , the element ba can also be used as a measure of the @xmath12-process contributions",
    ". the yield ratios ( e / eu)@xmath32 and ( e / fe)@xmath33 for the heavy @xmath12-elements and the cpr elements , as well as the yield ratios ( e / ba)@xmath32 for the cpr elements , are given in tables  [ tab - rhl ] and [ tab - yhl ] .",
    "we emphasize the phenomenological nature of the two - component model and its extension presented below .",
    "as discussed above , the yield patterns for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 sources were taken from the observed abundance patterns in two template stars .",
    "the validity of the model should be judged by its predictions for the abundances in other metal - poor stars .",
    "insofar as the predictions agree with the data , the model can be considered to have identified some key characteristics of nucleosynthesis in the relevant stellar sources .",
    "this approach can not replace the ab initio models of stellar nucleosynthesis , but is complimentary to the latter .",
    "we note that the production of the low-@xmath13 elements including fe in normal sne from progentiors of @xmath5@xmath6 ( @xmath26 source ) is demonstrated by extensive modeling of sn nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and so is the production of the cpr elements in the neutrino - driven wind associated with neutron star formation ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 sources ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the theoretical yields of the low-@xmath13 elements , especially the fe group , are subject to the many uncertainties in modeling the evolution and explosion of massive stars . in the absence of a solid understanding of the sn mechanism ,",
    "the explosion is artificially induced and the associated nucleosynthesis is parametrized by a `` mass cut '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) or constrained to fit the yields of @xmath34ni inferred from sn light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the cpr elements , no reliable quantitative yields are yet available .",
    "qw07 concluded that the neutrino - driven wind does not play a significant role in the production of the heavy @xmath12-elements and suggested that another environment with rapid expansion timescales inside low - mass ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) sne from o - ne - mg core collapse ( @xmath25 source ) is responsible for making these elements .",
    "subsequent work by @xcite showed that the propagation of a fast shock through the surface layers of an o - ne - mg core can provide the conditions leading to the production of the heavy @xmath12-elements .",
    "however , the required shock speed is not obtained in the current sn models @xcite based on the pre - sn structure of a @xmath35 core calculated by @xcite .",
    "clearly , more studies of the pre - sn evolution of o - ne - mg cores and their collapse are needed to test whether the heavy @xmath12-elements can indeed be produced in the shocked surface layers of such cores . in the following",
    "we assume that low - mass sne from o - ne - mg core collapse are the @xmath25 source solely responsible for producing the heavy @xmath12-elements and that the cpr elements are produced by both the @xmath25 and @xmath26 sources . at the present time",
    ", stellar models can not calculate the absolute yields from first principles for any of the sources discussed above and some ad hoc parametric treatment is required for modeling the nucleosynthesis of these sources .",

    "our analysis of the zr and ba data ( not presented in detail here ) is in full accord with the three - component model and leads to the same quantitative conclusion ( see  [ sec-3 cm ] and figure  [ fig - csrfe]d ) .",
    "we will now pursue the consequences of this approach .",
    "star formation in the early universe responsible for the enrichment of metal - poor stars is still not well understood .",
    "simulations indicate that the first stars were likely to be massive , ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 [ see @xcite for reviews of earlier works and @xcite for more recent studies ] .",
    "it is generally thought that stars form in the typical mass range of @xmath78@xmath9 subsequent to the epoch of the first stars .",
    "below we assume this simple scenario of star formation and focus on considerations of nucleosynthesis to identify the stellar types for the third source .",
    "the assumed third source produces the low-@xmath13 elements including fe but no cpr elements such as sr or heavier elements .",
    "as the cpr elements are here considered to be produced in the neutrino - driven wind from nascent neutron stars , there are two main candidates for the third source : ( 1 ) pair - instability sne ( pi - sne ) from very massive ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) stars ( vmss ) , in which the star is completely disrupted by the explosion and no neutron star is produced , and ( 2 ) massive sne with progenitors of @xmath8@xmath9 , in which a black hole forms either directly by the core collapse or through severe fallback onto the neutron star initially produced by the core collapse .",
    "there is observational evidence that massive sne have two branches : hne and faint sne with the latter thought to be much rarer . compared with normal sne ,",
    "hne have up to @xmath79 times higher explosion energies and @xmath80 times higher fe yields while faint sne have several times lower explosion energies and @xmath81 times lower fe yields [ see @xcite for interpretation of sn  1998bw as an hn , @xcite for the case of sn  1997d as a faint sn , and @xcite and references therein for other studies of hne and faint sne ] .",
    "it is important to note that hne are ongoing events in the present universe as evidenced by the occurrences of the associated gamma - ray bursts [ see e.g. , @xcite for the discovery of sn  1998bw , an hn associated with a gamma - ray burst ] .    in our assumed scenario of star formation , pi - sne can only occur at zero metallicity but hne and faint sne can occur at all epochs .",
    "in addition , these three types of events have very different yield patterns of the low-@xmath13 elements . compared with hne and faint sne , pi - sne have extremely low production of those low-@xmath13 elements with odd atomic numbers such as na , al , k , sc , v , mn , and co relative to their neighboring elements with even atomic numbers ( see figure  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is because unlike hne and faint sne that occur after all stages of core burning , pi - sne occur immediately following core c - burning and there is not sufficient time for weak interaction to provide the required neutron excess for significant production of the low-@xmath13 elements with odd atomic numbers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further , the production of the low-@xmath13 elements from na through mg relative to those from si through zn differs greatly between hne and faint sne .",
    "this is because the former elements are produced by hydrostatic burning during the pre - explosion evolution and the latter ones by explosive burning .",
    "the extremely weak explosion of faint sne would lead to very high yield ratios of the hydrostatic burning products relative to the explosive burning products .",
    "the decomposition of elemental abundances in terms of three components discussed in ",
    "[ sec - p ] and  [ sec - yla ] identifies those stars in which the fe is exclusively the product of the third source .",

    "we mean that for element e , the [ e / fe ] values for different stars are within @xmath83  dex of some mean value .",
    "it is also clear that there are no drastic variations in the [ e / fe ] values either between the elements with odd and even atomic numbers or between the hydrostatic and explosive burning products .",
    "we conclude that neither pi - sne nor faint sne can be the third source .",
    "this leaves hne as the third source .",
    "the abundance patterns of the low-@xmath13 elements in those stars that lie on the curve for @xmath47 in figure  [ fig - srfe ] should represent the yield pattern of these elements for the hypothecated @xmath26 source .",

    "it can be seen that the third source ( now taken to be hne ) and the @xmath26 source are indistinguishable in terms of their assigned contributions to the low-@xmath13 elements .",
    "this is also reflected by the fact that essentially all the stars in the region bounded by the curves for @xmath48 and 1 shown in figure  [ fig - srfe ] have the same quasi - uniform abundance patterns of the low-@xmath13 elements as established by the observations of @xcite ( see  [ sec - pan ] for discussion of the exceptional stars ) . as an example",

    "we are thus left with a most peculiar conundrum : the yield pattern of the low-@xmath13 elements attributed to the third source is the same as that attributed to the @xmath26 source .",
    "this is the same result that we @xcite found earlier in attempting to estimate the yield patterns of the stellar sources contributing in the regime of @xmath2}\\lesssim -3 $ ] using the data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the recent more extensive and precise data of @xcite lead to the same conclusion .",
    "we have associated the third source with hne and the @xmath26 source with normal sne . as hne and normal sne are concurrent in our assumed scenario of star formation and can not be distinguished based on their production of the low-@xmath13 elements , the contributions to these elements , especially fe , that we previously assigned to the @xmath26 source only may well be a combination of the contributions from both hne and normal sne . in this case ,",
    "the sr / fe ratio assigned to the @xmath26 source represents a mixture of sr contributions from normal sne and fe contributions from both hne and normal sne . in",

    ", we recognized that there must be a source producing fe and other low-@xmath13 elements but none of the @xmath12-elements @xcite .",
    "we therefore proposed a source that only occurred in very early epochs and did not occur later .",
    "this inference , in conjunction with the rather sharp break in the observed abundances of the heavy @xmath12-elements at @xmath2}\\sim-3 $ ] , led us to propose that pi - sne from vmss might be the source .",
    "it was argued that vmss were the first stars and that the very disruptive pi - sne associated with them provided a baseline of metals to the igm at a level of @xmath2}\\sim-3 $ ] .",
    "this apparent baseline was also found in damped lyman @xmath1 systems @xcite .",
    "however , in the framework of hierarchical structure formation , for halos that are not disrupted by explosions of massive stars ( see  [ sec - halo ] ) , the initial rate of growth in metallicity is so rapid that it would be very rare to find stars with @xmath2}<-3 $ ] @xcite .",
    "it is thus plausible that the rarity of ultra - metal - poor stars with @xmath2}<-3 $ ] results from the initial phase of rapid metal enrichment in all bound halos and is not due to a general `` prompt inventory '' in the igm .",

    "further , the search for ultra - metal - poor stars has shown that while stars with @xmath2}<-3 $ ] are rare , they do occur and show some evidence of elements heavier than the fe group in their spectra ( see @xcite for the discovery of the two most metal - poor stars with @xmath2}<-5 $ ] ) .",
    "thus , low - mass stars must be able to form from a medium with @xmath2}\\ll -3 $ ] . based on all the above considerations",

    "@xcite showed that even with photo - heating , to blow out all the gas from a halo of @xmath163 requires @xmath155  erg .",
    "consequently , after the debris from the first hne in halos of @xmath157 were collected into halos of @xmath160 , the debris from all subsequent stellar explosions in the larger halos would be bound to these halos and mixed therein . as estimated above , a single hn results in @xmath2}\\sim -3.3 $ ] to @xmath164 and a single normal sn results in @xmath2}\\sim -2.6 $ ] for bound halos .",

    "considerations of bound halos with gas infall and normal star formation rates show that a metallicity at the level of @xmath2}\\sim -3 $ ] is reached shortly after the onset of star formation in these halos @xcite .",

    "produce the low-@xmath13 elements including fe but no sr or heavier elements , this igm would have no sr or ba if none of the debris from the first low - mass and normal sne escaped from halos of @xmath157 .",
    "the very low values of @xmath7}\\sim -2.5 $ ] to @xmath166 and @xmath58}\\sim -2.5 $ ] to @xmath166 may indicate that @xmath7810% of the debris from the first low - mass and normal sne escaped from their hosting halos . alternatively , such low [ sr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] values could be explained by the mixing of the igm that fell into the halos forming at later times with small amounts of the debris from low - mass and normal sne therein .      the three - component model with hne , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 sources describes the available data on nearly all the stars very well . however , there are four exceptional stars that are identified as asterisks a , b , c , and d in figures  [ fig - esr ] , [ fig - srfe ] , [ fig - srba ] , and [ fig - csrfe]a",
    ". these stars are not anomalous in terms of sr and ba as shown by the above figures .",
    "however , figure  [ fig - pan ] shows that their abundance patterns of the low-@xmath13 elements differ greatly from those for hne and all the other stars ( see discussion of figure  [ fig - p ] in  [ sec - plowa ] ) . more specifically , while all stars have indistinguishable patterns of the explosive burning products from si through zn , these stars have extremely high abundances of the hydrostatic burning products na , mg , and al relative to the explosive burning products .",
    "such anomalous production patterns can be accounted for by faint sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which fall - back coupled with a weak explosion would hinder the ejection of the explosive burning products in the inner region much more than that of the hydrostatic burning products in the outer region . due to the weak explosion , the debris from faint sne would always be bound to their hosting halos .",
    "mixing with the debris from low - mass and normal sne to some small extent would preserve the anomalous patterns of the low-@xmath13 elements and add small amounts of sr and ba to the mixture .",
    "the stars that formed from this mixture would then appear as the exceptional stars discussed above . using @xmath167 and @xmath168  erg inferred from the light curve of sn  1997d and @xmath169 and @xmath170  erg for sn  1999br ( see figure 1 in @xcite and references therein ) , we find that for the corresponding mixing mass ( see equations  [ [ eq - mmix ] ] ) a single faint sn like these two would result in @xmath2}\\sim -3.5 $ ] ( sn  1997d ) and @xmath171 ( sn  1999br ) ( cf .",
    "equation  [ [ eq - fehn ] ] ) .",
    "these [ fe / h ] values are close to those of the exceptional stars b ( @xmath2}=-3.94 $ ] ) and c ( @xmath2}=-3.70 $ ] ) .",
    "this is compatible with a single faint sn giving rise to the anomalous abundance pattern of the low-@xmath13 elements in each exceptional star .",
    "the two - component model of qw07 with the @xmath25 and @xmath26 sources provided a good description of the elemental abundances in metal - poor stars of the galactic halo for @xmath172}\\lesssim -1.5 $ ] .",
    "a key ingredient of that model is the attribution of the elements from sr through ag in metal - poor stars to the charged - particle reactions in neutrino - driven winds from nascent neutron stars but not to the @xmath12-process .",
    "however , that model can not explain the great shortfall in the abundances of sr , y , and zr relative to fe for stars with @xmath2}\\lesssim -3 $ ] .",
    "the observations on these three cpr elements require that there be an early source producing fe but no sr or heavier elements .",
    "it is shown that if such a third source is assumed , then the data can be well explained by an extended three - component model . from considerations of the abundance patterns of the low-@xmath13 elements ( from na through zn ) , it is concluded that this third source is most likely associated with hne from massive stars of @xmath8@xmath9 that do not leave behind neutron stars .",
    "we here consider the third source to be hne .",
    "it is shown that the available data on the evolution of [ sr / fe ] with [ ba / fe ] , that of [ y / fe ] with [ la / fe ] , and that of [ zr / fe ] with [ ba / fe ] are well described by the extended model with hne , @xmath25 and @xmath26 sources , which also provides clear constraints on the abundance ratios that should be seen .",
    "it is further shown that the abundance patterns of the low-@xmath13 elements for hne and the @xmath26 sources are not distinguishable . considering that hne are observed to be ongoing events in the present universe ,",
    "we are forced to conclude that the @xmath26 source , which was assumed to have provided @xmath21 of the solar fe inventory ( the rest attributed to sne ia ) , is in fact a combination of normal sne ( from progenitors of @xmath5@xmath6 ) , which we define as the @xmath27 source , and hne .",
    "the net fe contributions from hne are found to be @xmath173 times larger than those from normal sne .    using the three - component model with hne , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 sources",
    ", we obtain a very good quantitative description of essentially all the available data . in particular , this model provides strong constraints on the evolution of [ sr / fe ] with [ ba / fe ] in terms of the allowed domain for these abundance ratios .",
    "it gives an equally good description of the data when any cpr element besides sr ( e.g. , y or zr ) or any heavy @xmath12-element besides ba ( e.g. , la ) is used .",
    "the model is also compatible with the non-@xmath30-process contributions to the solar abundances of all the cpr elements .",
    "the anomalous abundance patterns of the low-@xmath13 elements observed in a small number of stars appear to fit the description of faint sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which are a rarer type of events from the same progenitor mass range as hne but with even weaker explosion energies and smaller fe yields than normal sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the anomalous abundance patterns observed reflect the fact that faint sne produce very little of the fe group elements but an abundant amount of the elements from hydrostatic burning in their outer shells .",
    "this gives rise to the extremely high abundances of na , mg , and al relative to fe observed in the anomalous stars .",
    "the quasi - uniform abundance patterns of the elements from si through zn in all cases ( including the stars with anomalous abundances of na , mg , and al ) appear to reflect some robustness in the outcome of explosive burning that may arise from the limited range of conditions required for such nucleosynthesis .",
    "in this paper we used the elemental yield patterns for three prototypical model sources to calculate the abundances of an extensive set of elements ( relative to hydrogen ) for metal - poor stars with @xmath2}\\lesssim -1.5 $ ] .",
    "as the yield patterns adopted for the assumed prototypical sources are taken from the data on two template stars , they must represent the results of stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "the full version of the three - component model appears very successful in calculating the abundances of the elements ranging from na through pt in stars with @xmath2}\\lesssim -1.5 $ ] .",
    "in contrast to this phenomenological approach , there are extensive studies of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) that use the various theoretical results on the absolute yields of metals for different stellar types .",
    "these theoretical yields are not calculated from first principles , but are dependent on the parametrization used in the various stellar models . in those gce studies , the elemental abundances for an individual star are not predicted . instead ,",
    "general trends for the elemental abundances are calculated assuming different sources , the rates at which they contribute , and a model of mixing in the ism for different regions of the galaxy .",
    "these results give a good broad description for typical elemental abundances in the general stellar population at higher metallicities of @xmath2}>-1.5 $ ] .",
    "this is a regime in which the observational data are quite convergent with only limited variability .",
    "however , as anticipated by @xcite and supported by the considerable scatter in the abundances of heavy elements observed in stars with @xmath2}\\lesssim -1.5 $ ] , the chemical composition of the ism in the early galaxy was extremely inhomogeneous . for @xmath2}<-2",
    "$ ] there are gross discrepancies between the observations and the smoothed model of gce . in no case",
    "does that model give the elemental abundances for an individual star .",
    "it is our view that the simple phenomenological model used here permits a clearer distinction between the different stellar sources contributing to the ism and the igm at early times .",
    "this model also gives specific testable predictions , which can be used to further check its validity .    in conclusion , we consider that the general three - component model with hne , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 sources provides a quantitative and self - consistent description of nearly all the available data on elemental abundances in stars with @xmath2}\\lesssim -1.5 $ ] .",
    "further , hne may be not only explosions from the first massive stars ( i.e. , the population iii stars much sought after by many ) that provided a very early and variable inventory to the igm through ejection of enriched gas from small halos , but also are important ongoing contributors to the chemical evolution of the universe .",

    "<S> if we expand our previous phenomenological two - component model to include three components ( low - mass and normal sne and hne ) and use for example , the observed abundances of ba , sr , and fe to separate the contributions from these components , we find that essentially all of the data are very well described by the new model . </S>",
