    "strange nonchaotic attractors ( snas ) are considered as typical structures of quasiperiodically forced nonlinear systems .",
    "they are geometrically strange ( that is they are fractal in nature ) just like the chaotic attractors , while all their lyapunov exponents are either zero or negative which ensure that the underlying dynamics is nonchaotic .",
    "further , due to their fractal nature , the snas are characterized by aperiodic oscillations . following the pioneering work of grebogi et al .",
    "@xcite , snas have been extensively investigated theoretically in several dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "the existence of snas has also been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite in a few physically relevant situations . as a consequence ,",
    "several routes ( scenarios having distinct signatures ) to snas have been reported theoretically .",
    "these include heagy - hammel route  @xcite , gradual fractalization route  @xcite , various types of intermittency routes  @xcite , blowout bifurcation route  @xcite , etc .",
    "as all these bifurcation scenarios ( routes to snas ) have been well established in the literature , we summarize the different scenarios for the formation of snas along with their distinct signatures / mechanisms in table  i. reviews on snas can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , while extensive numerical studies on the birth of snas via different routes are available in the literature  @xcite , only a few experimental realizations of them exist  @xcite .",
    "in particular , these exotic attractors were confirmed by an experiment consisting of a quasiperiodically forced , buckled , magneto - elastic ribbon  @xcite .",
    "snas were also realized in analog simulations of a multistable potential  @xcite , and in a neon glow discharge experiment  @xcite .",
    "these attractors were also shown to be related to the anderson localization phenomenon in the schr@xmath0dinger equation with a quasiperiodic potential  @xcite .",
    "very recently snas have also been observed in an excitable chemical system , namely a three electrode electrochemical cell  @xcite . in this connection , from an experimental point of view , nonlinear electronic circuits with suitable quasiperiodic forces turn out to be especially useful dynamical systems for the identification and study of snas . for example",
    ", type - i intermittency route to sna was reported in a quasiperiodically forced murali - lakshmanan - chua circuit  @xcite .",
    "recently , three prominent routes , namely heagy - hammel , fractalization and type - iii intermittency routes to snas , have been identified and reported in a quasiperiodically forced negative conductance series lcr circuit with a diode  @xcite both experimentally and numerically by some of the present authors .    in almost all the above studies , as a general rule , the driving forces are assumed to be sinusoidal in nature .",
    "naturally the question arises as to what happens to the dynamics when one or both of the driving forces are nonsinusoidal but periodic .",
    "can new routes to the birth of snas emerge in such a scenario ? in order to answer these questions , we consider the quasiperiodically driven negative conductance series lcr circuit with a diode ( which was investigated in  @xcite ) and unravel the dynamics of the circuit with one of the forces taken as a square wave force ( nonsinusoidal ) for suitable parameter values .",
    "the main reason for choosing square wave as one of the driving forces is its bistable nature .",
    "bistability is responsible for hysteresis in many physical and technical systems  @xcite .",
    "further , the square wave has also been used for inducing chaos in certain dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "for example a 10 mhz square wave optical message was injected into a ring laser to produce high - dimensional chaotic light  @xcite .",
    "thus the study of the present circuit has considerable relevance in understanding sna transitions ."

    "<S> we identify a novel route to the birth of a strange nonchaotic attractor ( sna ) in a quasiperiodically forced electronic circuit with a nonsinusoidal ( square wave ) force as one of the quasiperiodic forces through numerical and experimental studies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that bubbles appear in the strands of the quasiperiodic attractor due to the instability induced by the additional square wave type force . </S>",
    "<S> the bubbles then enlarge and get increasingly wrinkled as a function of the control parameter . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the bubbles get extremely wrinkled ( while the remaining parts of the strands of the torus remain largely unaffected ) resulting in the birth of the sna which we term as the _ bubbling route to sna_. we characterize and confirm this birth from both experimental and numerical data by maximal lyapunov exponents and their variance , poincar maps , fourier amplitude spectra and spectral distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> we also strongly confirm the birth of sna via the bubbling route by the distribution of the finite - time lyapunov exponents . </S>"
