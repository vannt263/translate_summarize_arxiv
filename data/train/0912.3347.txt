    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are a major area of interest in solar physics , both because of their influence on the near - earth environment @xcite , and because of their role in the global magnetic field evolution @xcite .",
    "however , the physical mechanism or mechanisms responsible for their initiation remains an open question ; while there is agreement that the driving energy must originate in the magnetic field , the manner in which this free magnetic energy is built up and released is still under debate @xcite .",
    "the present study considers a particular model for cme initiation : the quasi - static build - up and sudden loss of equilibrium of coronal magnetic flux ropes , in response to the large - scale surface motions of differential rotation and meridional flow , and to flux cancellation .",
    "these motions generate electric currents in the corona and the resulting magnetic helicity becomes concentrated in twisted flux rope structures above polarity inversion lines in the photospheric field @xcite .",
    "this formation process takes place over timescales on the order of a month and is therefore an appealing mechanism for the formation of quiescent filaments @xcite .",
    "recent simulations of the global corona demonstrate that this mechanism can account for the observed hemispheric pattern of filament chirality @xcite , as well as leading to the ejection of flux ropes @xcite . on shorter timescales ( hours to days )",
    ", observations show that magnetic flux in active regions can emerge highly twisted , carrying substantial currents from beneath the photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although we include a net magnetic helicity in emerging active regions , our large - scale , quasi - static model can not follow the dynamic evolution of the flux emergence and its rapid reconfiguration on entering the corona .",
    "indeed , the model was originally designed to follow the large - scale dispersal of magnetic flux and helicity from active regions , so does not , at present , follow the detailed evolution on short timescales that is observed inside active regions . this paper aims to determine how the distribution of flux rope ejections in the model compares with that of observed cmes .",
    "we do this through a direct comparison between the simulation results of @xcite and cme observations over a 4.5-month period in 1999 using the solar & heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",
    "this is the first such comparison of cmes with long - term simulations representing observed magnetic configurations on the sun .",
    "a difficulty with such a direct observational comparison lies in the identification of cme source regions in the low corona .",
    "there are multiple low - coronal signatures that may indicate the cme source region , including : coronal dimming regions , a post - eruptive arcade , a filament eruption and/or a coronal wave .",
    "however , on occasion , cmes are detected which appear to have no low - coronal source region at all ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such cmes may originate from higher in the corona , and lack a low - coronal signature .",
    "even when a low - coronal signature is observed , confidently linking it with a particular cme requires a case - by - case study , and consideration of both spatial location and a plausible temporal association between the cme and its low coronal signature is required .",
    "part of our aim in this paper is therefore to consider how meaningful a comparison of simulations with observations can be , and what would be needed for a better comparison .",
    "the key feature of this work is that we simulate the global magnetic field in the solar corona , so that flux ropes form in a time - dependent manner at different locations on the sun , in response to emergence of active regions and large - scale surface motions .",
    "this is in contrast to previous studies which have typically modelled a single cme event in a simplified magnetic configuration , in order to consider the basic physical processes leading to loss of equilibrium .",
    "these studies indicate that the evolution of flux ropes , and whether sudden eruption will occur , depends both on the photospheric footpoint motions @xcite and on the overlying , background magnetic field @xcite . in the model used in this paper ,",
    "the footpoint motions are determined by the large - scale surface motions of differential rotation , meridional flow , and supergranular diffusion , while the overlying magnetic field at the location of each flux rope is determined self - consistently in the global magnetic configuration .",
    "this allows us to place constraints on the applicability of this cme initiation mechanism on the real sun . in this context",
    ", several recent studies have looked at the large - scale magnetic topology of observed cme source regions , focusing on whether the background field is bipolar or quadrupolar , because cme initiation models differ fundamentally in this respect @xcite .",
    "our model takes into account this topology automatically , because both the flux rope and its overlying field are part of the global magnetic configuration .",
    "the lack of any previous such global models may be explained by the need for coronal electric currents , required in order to store free magnetic energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these must be built up in a time - dependent manner , either rapidly through the emergence of pre - twisted structures , or over longer timescales by surface shearing , as in the simulations in this paper .",
    "global full - mhd models are too computationally demanding to model this time evolution over many weeks , although they have been successful in modelling both global equilibria @xcite and the evolution of individual cme events @xcite .",
    "instead , our model uses a quasi - static approximation to the magnetic field evolution in order to follow the formation of currents and the transport of magnetic helicity , albeit in a simplified manner .    in section [ sec : obs ]",
    "we describe the instrumentation and data reduction used to identify the source regions of observed cmes .",
    "the main features of the simulations are outlined in section [ sec : sims ] , before comparing the observed and simulated distributions of cme sources in section [ sec : comp ] .",
    "the relation between the two is discussed in section [ sec : discuss ] , and conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] , where we also make recommendations for future study .",
    "we began by compiling a list of cmes between 1999 may 13 and 1999 september 26 from the cdaw ( coordinated data analysis workshops ) catalog @xcite .",
    "this is the standard manually - compiled list of cmes observed by the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) experiment since 1996 @xcite .",
    "the c2 and c3 coronagraphs observe the white - light corona from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 to @xmath4 respectively . our comparison period is selected from the rising phase of the solar cycle , so as to include magnetic field structures representative of both solar maximum ( in the newly - emerged active regions ) and solar minimum ( in the remnant regions and polar fields at higher latitudes ) .",
    "this period has the further advantage that it was used in our previous simulations to investigate the parameter dependence of the model ( most recently with regard to the formation and ejection of flux ropes , * ? ? ?",
    "the start date of our comparison period is chosen to allow sufficient time for the simulation to evolve away from the initial condition on 1999 april 16 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the end date just precedes the break in soho / eit observations that occurred between 1999 september 27 and 1999 october 5 .",
    "in order to concentrate on well - observed cmes , we ignored all events labelled `` poor '' by the cdaw observers . after studying the lasco / c2 running difference movies of each remaining event ,",
    "a further 12 very weak events were removed , as were 19 events which we could not clearly identify to be independent from other events .",
    "in addition , our study of corresponding eit observations ( to be described below ) led us to split one event in the cdaw catalog  on 1999 august 18 at 05:54into two separate eruptions . a list of 330 cmes remained , including both halo and limb events .",
    "there are some well - known uncertainties in the cdaw observations .",
    "firstly , they are sensitive to projection effects , with cmes in the plane of the sky being better observed @xcite . however , since our data cover several solar rotations , there should be no systematic bias in the overall longitude distribution .",
    "secondly , the selection of events is subjective .",
    "recently , an automated cme catalog , cactus @xcite , has been developed to reduce subjectivity in the detection of cmes by detecting radial motion in height - time maps of lasco data . although many additional events are detected in cactus , they tend to be narrow events , background outflows , or multiple detections of the same cme @xcite .",
    "thus the manual cdaw catalog is sufficient for comparison with simulated flux rope ejections .",
    "the third main limitation of lasco observations is that they do not show the initiation locations of eruptions in the low corona , because cmes often move non - radially before they reach the c2 field of view ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this study we have used additional observations in extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) to determine , where possible , the cme source locations in the low corona .",
    "our unsuccessful attempt to use an alternative h@xmath0 data set is described in section [ sec : halpha ] .",

    "these include erupting filaments , flares , post - eruption arcades , and transient coronal dimmings , in addition to eit coronal waves @xcite .",
    "eit observations at up to 12-minute cadence were available in the @xmath5 filter for the hours leading up to and following 321 of the 330 cmes in our study period .",
    "each of these were studied manually , in conjunction with the lasco movie showing the cme .",
    "possible cme signatures were recorded .",
    "we were unable to use eit images in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 filters as images were available only on one or two days during each month .",
    "to minimize subjective bias , two of us ( ary and gdra ) carried out this analysis independently , before comparing results and compiling a final event list ( given in appendix [ sec : app ] ) .",
    "further , each cme was assigned to one of the following categories :    1 .",
    "clearly associated front - side source visible in eit .",
    "plausibly associated front - side source visible in eit .",
    "source becomes visible in eit above the limb , but originated behind limb .",
    "4 .   no plausibly - associated eit source evident .",
    "the first two categories give two degrees of certainty to our front - side source identifications .",
    "the third category describes cmes where the low coronal source of the cme becomes visible in eit above the limb , but its source on the solar disk lies behind the limb , so that a longitude position can not be determined . the locations of the possible sources in categories 1 and 2 were recorded manually by overlaying a latitude - longitude grid on the eit movies .",
    "identified source locations in category 1 are shown by asterisks in figure [ fig : obs ] .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] lists the number of cmes in each category . for the comparison with simulations in this paper",
    ", we use only the 98 source locations in category 1 , _",
    "i.e. _ , those clearly identified with cmes .",
    "this represents only 30% of the observed cmes , highlighting the difficulties associated with identifying cme source regions in the low corona .     in ( a ) ,",
    "@xmath9 in ( b ) , and @xmath10 days in ( c ) . ]",
    "latitude , longitude and time distributions of cme source regions identified in euv are shown by the filled gray histograms in figure [ fig : obshist ] .",
    "the bimodal latitude distribution of euv sources is consistent with those found over the same period by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 10b ) , who carried out a similar soho / eit analysis for a subset of `` structured '' cmes between 1996 and 2002 .",
    "although our analysis in this paper is restricted to the year 1999 , the results of @xcite indicate that the latitude distribution changes over the solar cycle , with an extension of the cme source distribution right down to the equator at solar maximum , in addition to a high latitude branch corresponding to polar crown filament eruptions .",
    "this cycle variation is supported by observations of the latitudes of disappearing filaments @xcite .",
    "the longitude distribution of cme sources is less structured , although from figure [ fig : obs](a ) we see a strong clustering into several activity complexes @xcite , such as at longitude @xmath11 in the southern hemisphere , or @xmath12 in the northern hemisphere .",
    "these active longitudes are also responsible for major fluctuations in the time distribution ( figure [ fig : obshist]c ) .    the dashed histograms in figures [ fig : obshist](a ) and ( c ) show the apparent latitude and time distributions of all 330 cmes from the cdaw catalogue .",
    "as expected , the distribution differs from those of the low coronal sources @xcite .",
    "the two main differences are ( 1 ) more events at the equator , consistent with the deflection of some events towards the equator as they propagate out @xcite , and ( 2 ) more events at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere .",
    "this north - south asymmetry in the latitude distribution of lasco cmes is a feature of the year 1999 , evident in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the solid black histograms in figure [ fig : obshist ] show the equivalent distributions of flux rope ejections in simulation run a4 .",
    "the simulations will be described in section [ sec : sims ] .      as an alternative to using euv images",
    ", we also tried identifying source locations of observed cmes using a database of h@xmath0 events assembled by @xcite .",
    "this database lists the locations of flares and disappearing filaments in solar geophysical data that may be associated with cmes in the cdaw catalogue .",
    "a surface event is associated with a particular cme if it occurred within @xmath13 hour of the cme onset time ( estimated assuming a constant outward speed ) , and if its latitude and longitude are in the same quadrant as any part of the angular span of the cme .",
    "it should be noted that , in this database , some cmes are associated with multiple possible surface events , and many with none .",
    "also , some surface events are listed with multiple cmes . in an attempt to select only those cmes with reasonably consistent locations given by the h@xmath0 events , we filter out cmes whose list of associated h@xmath0 events has standard deviations greater than @xmath14 in latitude or @xmath15 in longitude .",
    "this leaves 137 cmes with consistent locations in the h@xmath0 database , in the sense that the h@xmath0 events associated with each cme are reasonably close together spatially .",
    "these source locations are shown by diamonds in figure [ fig : obs ] .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : obs ] that , like the locations identified in euv , those identified in h@xmath0 data are not uniformly distributed , but rather are clustered into several major activity complexes .",
    "unfortunately , we find that the h@xmath0 source locations are not consistent with the euv source locations .",
    "firstly , it is evident from figure [ fig : obs ] that the h@xmath0 sources are even more strongly clustered into active regions , with no sources whatsoever observed at latitudes above about @xmath16 .",
    "the correlation coefficient between the euv and h@xmath0 spatial distributions is only @xmath17 ( when binned in @xmath15 latitude bins and @xmath18 longitude bins , following the method described in section [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy becomes even more serious when considering the source locations identified with particular cmes .",
    "there are 42 cmes with both a category 1 source location in euv and a location identified in h@xmath0 .",
    "however , the h@xmath0 location overlaps the euv location ( to within @xmath19 in latitude and @xmath20 in longitude ) in only 22 of these cases .",
    "we are inclined to favor the euv locations rather than the h@xmath0 locations ( at least for category 1 euv events ) because the euv data were examined in detail on a case - by - case basis , which differs from the approach used to compile the h@xmath0 listing .",
    "the less careful association of h@xmath0 events with individual cmes is exemplified by 23 events which were clearly seen to originate from behind the limb in euv , yet in the h@xmath0 database were associated with flares that happened to occur co - temporally on the solar disk .",
    "the h@xmath0 observations do have the potential advantage of a higher cadence than the euv images ( minutes rather than over @xmath21 minutes ) , so could in principle identify additional cme sources that were missed in euv .",
    "however , in this particular database , we have no clear way of selecting which of many possible h@xmath0 events are actually associated with each ( or any ) cme",
    ". therefore , we base the comparison with our simulations on the euv data only .",

    "this arises not only due to shearing by the large - scale surface motions , but also because the newly - emerging bipolar regions may be given a non - zero helicity , controlled by a `` twist '' parameter @xmath38 , described in detail by @xcite . as discussed in that paper ,",

    "flux ropes form above polarity inversion lines where axial fields build up after flux cancellation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the axial ( sheared ) components originate both from the emergence of twisted bipoles and from shearing by large - scale surface motions , so that the distribution of flux ropes in the simulations depends to some extent on the balance of these two contributions .    from the dashed line in figure [ fig : time ] , it is clear that the correlation disappears in simulation run an , where no new bipolar regions were inserted after the initial condition .",
    "this suggests that the correlation observed in the other simulation runs arises primarily from the magnetic field distribution on the solar surface .",
    "this is essentially captured by the surface flux transport component of the simulations .",
    "to investigate this idea further , we consider purely the distribution of @xmath41 on the solar surface @xmath42 , which is the same in all simulation runs except an .",

    "it is summarized in figure [ fig : br](a ) , which shows the latitude - longitude distribution of @xmath43 , where the average is taken over all 136 days in the comparison period .",
    "the magnetic field is clearly non - uniform over the solar surface , and is concentrated in several major activity complexes , corresponding well to the clusters of observed cme sources identified in euv ( shown by asterisks ) . for comparison ,",
    "the triangles show the locations of flux rope ejections in run a4 , which are more evenly spread over the solar surface than the observed source regions . in a similar vein ,",
    "figure [ fig : br](b ) shows a map of @xmath44 , the time - averaged horizontal gradient of @xmath41 on the solar surface .",
    "the distribution resembles that of @xmath43 , except that there is a greater concentration in the active region belts relative to higher latitudes .    ; ( b ) horizontal gradient in radial surface field @xmath45 ; ( c ) current helicity @xmath46 at height @xmath47 in run a4 . in each case",
    "asterisks show observed cme sources and triangles show locations of simulated ejections in run a4 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we may consider using these quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 themselves as predictors of cme source locations . for this purpose",
    "we use the same binning as before , calculating the mean values of these new quantities in each bin .",
    "table [ tab : br ] shows the resulting correlations with observed cme source locations , for various choices of time bin size .",
    "notably , both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are better correlated with observed cme sources than are the flux rope ejections in any of the simulation runs .",
    "for example , the spatial distribution ( 136-day bins ) of euv sources has a correlation coefficient of @xmath48 with @xmath43 and @xmath49 with @xmath44 , but only 0.49 with flux rope ejections in run a4 .",
    "from table [ tab : br ] , we see that the correlations are maintained for time bins as short as 17 days , and are consistently better than the simulated ejections ( table [ tab : spatial ] ) . table [ tab : br ] also shows that @xmath44 is better correlated with observed cme locations than is @xmath43 .",
    "this is presumably because the former is more concentrated in active regions , where the majority of observed cme sources are located .",
    "indeed , measures of active region complexity based on strong gradients of radial photospheric magnetic flux have been found to correlate with production from those regions both of large flares @xcite and of cmes @xcite .",
    "if vector magnetograms are available , alternative characterisations of the magnetic complexity are possible ; for example , @xcite find a correlation between magnetic twist and the locations of h@xmath0 flare signatures within active regions .",
    "of course , although @xmath44 is better correlated with the distribution of observed cmes , it could not be used to predict their time of occurrence , because the photospheric magnetic field does not change significantly between the pre - eruption and post - eruption state .",
    "therefore , time - dependent models of the 3d coronal magnetic field evolution must still be developed for this purpose .",
    "@xcite showed that the amount of helicity in emerging bipolar regions does alter the simulated flux rope ejections , but this would appear to have only a small effect on the correlation with observed cme sources .",
    "figure [ fig : br](c ) shows the time - averaged current helicity @xmath50 in simulation run a4 , at a height of @xmath51 in the low corona ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion of the distribution of @xmath0 ) . from the triangles in figure",
    "[ fig : br](c ) , we see that the ejections in run a4 always occur at locations of strong @xmath46 in the simulation .",
    "however , if we compute the correlation between the binned distribution of @xmath46 and the observed cme sources , we find a correlation coefficient of only @xmath52 , much lower than for @xmath43 or @xmath44 , and also lower than for the simulated ejections .",
    "this is because the observed cme sources are much more strongly concentrated in active regions than is the distribution of current helicity in the simulation .",
    "however , there are some euv sources observed at higher latitudes , mainly quiescent filament eruptions .",
    "so the clustering of observed cme sources at active latitudes does not preclude the presence of coronal currents at higher latitudes .",
    "it is possible that there are two essentially different subsets of cmes : those produced by quasi - static shearing and flux cancellation , not dissimilar to the distribution of flux rope ejections in our model , and a second set of events concentrated in active regions and resulting from more dynamic and/or smaller - scale processes not included in our model .",
    "indeed , observations over several decades suggest that cmes originating from active regions and associated with flares have different kinematic properties from those associated with prominence eruptions outside active regions .",
    "the former are faster , while the latter start more slowly and show gradual acceleration with height @xcite .",
    "however , it is still not certain whether cmes with different speeds are qualitatively different @xcite , and @xcite show how both could arise from flux ropes in different configurations .",
    "the euv observations in this paper do not generally allow us to directly establish the presence or absence of a flux rope morphology , except for well - observed filament eruptions .",
    "in this paper , magnetic flux rope ejections in a global model of the coronal magnetic field evolution have been compared directly with low - coronal cme source regions identified in euv , over a 136-day period in 1999 . despite limitations in identifying the source regions of observed cmes , which was unambiguously possible for only a third of events , we find some definite correlation between the distributions of simulated ejections and observed cme sources",
    ". however , there are also clear differences between the observed and simulated distributions ; the model produces fewer ejections overall , and much less clustering of ejections in active regions , even given the incomplete observations .",
    "the correlation that is present between simulated and observed ejections originates primarily in the large - scale distribution of magnetic field on the solar surface , the basic observational input driving the coronal simulations .",
    "the correlation is only significant when the ejections are binned in time bins of at least 34 days , which is approximately the frequency ( 27 days ) at which new observations of the surface magnetic field are are available as input to coronal simulations .",
    "there is a weak dependence of the correlation on the helicity in emerging active regions , but this is a secondary effect .",
    "interestingly , the choice of emerging helicity that performs best is simulation run a4 , which is also the run that most accurately reproduced the observed pattern of filament chirality @xcite .",
    "however , a better predictor of cmes than the locations of flux rope ejections is found to be simply the radial magnetic field on the solar surface , and in particular its horizontal gradient .",
    "this quantity is readily computed from surface flux transport simulations alone ( or , periodically , from observed line - of - sight magnetic maps ) .",
    "its good correlation with the observed cme source locations arises because the observed sources are clustered strongly into active regions , where the magnetic field is strong .",
    "by contrast , the simulated flux rope ejections are more evenly distributed over the solar surface , following the distribution of current helicity in the model .",
    "they do show some concentration towards active latitudes , reflecting the smaller scales of current helicity found in the more complex magnetic fields there , but the distribution is clearly different .",
    "our results allow us to place constraints on the possible initiation mechanisms of cmes , at least in the rising phase of the 11-year solar cycle .",
    "since flux ropes in the simulations are formed by gradual , quasi - static shearing of the magnetic field by large - scale motions , along with flux cancellation , we conclude that this mechanism can not be responsible for all cmes on the sun , although it is sufficient to produce a significant fraction @xcite .",
    "whether this fraction varies over the solar cycle is a question for future research .",
    "based on our results here , we propose that there are two subsets of cmes produced by essentially different mechanisms : those produced by large - scale , gradual transport of helicity ( which may originate either from active regions or shearing by surface motions ) , and a second population concentrated in active regions .",
    "the former occur on timescales of weeks or even months , and are simulated in our model .",
    "the latter must occur on much shorter timescales , connected with the dynamic emergence of magnetic fields in active regions and their energetic restructuring .",
    "since our model was originally developed to study the large - scale transport of magnetic helicity in the corona , it can not produce the second type of cme using the present form of input data ( synoptic magnetograms ) . to reproduce",
    "the frequent ejections observed from active regions will require , as a minimum , magnetogram data at much higher spatial and time resolution for input to the quasi - static simulations , at least within active regions themselves .",
    "however , given the dynamic nature of many events , it is likely that detailed , time - dependent mhd simulations of complex structures will need to be performed , based on observations of flux emergence such as those by _ hinode _ @xcite . at present , developing a detailed understanding of the initiation of such cmes that could possibly lead to predictive capability is far out of reach , although there have been recent advances in modelling flux emergence in simplified configurations @xcite .",
    "perhaps a more achievable goal in the short term is to understand the evolution leading to the initiation of the first type of cme , those produced by quasi - static shearing . above the active latitudes ,",
    "remnant magnetic fields from active regions do not retain most of the complexity of their originating regions , and shearing motions along with flux cancellation over longer time - scales become more important .",
    "our existing model provides a starting point to understand the net effect of these motions on flux rope development .",
    "however , the transport of helicity over the solar surface means that , at least at mid - latitudes , the formation of flux ropes is sensitive to the amount of magnetic helicity in individual emerging active regions , which is not yet routinely observed , despite recent improvements in techniques @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming launch of nasa s solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) should improve the situation , with full - disk vector magnetograms at high cadence and resolution .",
    "this should allow us to put better constraints on the amount of helicity in the solar corona , and to further validate our quasi - static model for flux rope formation .",
    "there is also an open question as to the origin of sheared fields at high latitudes . in our present simulations , where helicity emerges from the solar interior only in active regions , differential",
    "rotation is the dominant source of helicity at high latitudes , but produces the opposite sign of helicity there to that observed @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the observational identification of cme source regions is not straightforward . our attempt to use an alternative database of cme source regions in h@xmath0",
    "highlights the need for careful case - by - case investigation , preferably in multiple wavelengths . with a maximum cadence of 12 minutes in eit 195 data",
    ", we were able to confidently determine the cme source regions of only 98 events on - disk , with a further 55 originating from behind the limb , out of a total of 330 cmes .",
    "this is certainly incomplete .",
    "the situation should be improved in future , using higher - cadence observations at multiple euv wavelengths , for example from sdo . however ,",
    "if future aims are to identify the relative importance of different cme initiation mechanisms in the global context , then a comprehensive catalog of cme sources must be built up over a long period . only then can more definitive comparisons with theoretical models be made .",
    "again , sdo offers some promise in this respect : for example , automated feature - finding algorithms for detecting the low - coronal signatures of cmes in the anticipated sdo data are in preparation @xcite .",
