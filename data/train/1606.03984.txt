    "in classical propositional logic the propositional atoms , say @xmath2 , are given a truth value @xmath3 or @xmath4 by what is called a valuation and then any propositional formula @xmath0 can be associated with the set @xmath5 of valuations giving @xmath0 the value @xmath3 .",
    "this constitutes a perfect analysis of the circumstances under which @xmath0 is true .",
    "the formula @xmath0 can be presented in so - called disjunctive normal form based on taking the disjunction of descriptions of the valuations in @xmath5 .",
    "two fundamental results can be proved for classical propositional logic .",
    "the first says that _ every _ set of valuations of @xmath2 is equal to @xmath5 for some propositional formula @xmath0 .",
    "the second fundamental result says that there is a simple _ complete _ axiomatization of those @xmath0 that are valid in the sense that @xmath5 is the full set of all valuations on the propositional atoms occurring in @xmath0 .    in this paper , which continues @xcite",
    ", we consider a richer semantics called _ team semantics _ for propositional logic . in team semantics",
    "the truth of a propositional formula is evaluated in a _ set _ of valuations , called a _ team _ , rather than in an individual valuation .",
    "this offers the possibility of considering _ probabilities _ of formulas , as in @xcite , and the meaning of concepts such as _ dependence , independence _ and _ inclusion _ , as in @xcite .",
    "it is the latter possibility that is our focus in this paper .",
    "team semantics was introduced by the second author in @xcite on the basis of a new compositional semantics , due to hodges @xcite , for independence friendly logic @xcite .",
    "the monograph @xcite was written in the context of predicate logic and team semantics was used to give meaning to a variable being totally determined by a sequence of other variables . in the context of propositional and modal logic team semantics was introduced in @xcite . in propositional logic team semantics can be used to give meaning to a propositional variable being totally determined by a sequence of other variables .",
    "it took a few years before this idea was fully exploited in @xcite .",
    "meanwhile modal dependence logic , i.e. team semantics for modal logic , was investigated e.g. in @xcite .    when propositional formulas are evaluated in a team  i.e .",
    "a set  of valuations , a whole new landscape opens in front of us .",
    "the first observation is a numerical explosion : if we have @xmath6 propositional atoms , there are @xmath7 valuations , @xmath8 teams , and @xmath9 sets of teams . for @xmath10",
    "the third number is about @xmath11 .",
    "this emphasises the need for mathematical methods in team semantics .",
    "the truth table methods which list all possibilities is bad enough in ordinary propositional logic , but totally untenable in team semantics .    in classical propositional logic ,",
    "we associate with every formula @xmath0 based on propositional atoms @xmath12 the set @xmath5 of _ valuations _ that satisfy @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , in team semantics we associate with every formula @xmath0 based on propositional atoms @xmath12 the set @xmath1 of _ teams _ that satisfy ( in the sense defined below ) @xmath0 . by choosing our formulas",
    "carefully we can express _ every _ set of teams in the form @xmath1 for suitable @xmath0 , but this requires going beyond the logical operations of classical propositional logic .",
    "we can also axiomatize the propositional formulas that are _ valid _ i.e. satisfied by every team .",
    "the rich structure of teams gives rise to a plethora of new propositional connectives .",
    "most importantly , disjunction has several versions . to define",
    "when a team @xmath13 satisfies @xmath14 we can say that this happens if @xmath13 satisfies @xmath0 or it satisfies @xmath15 , or we can say that this happens if @xmath13 is the union of two sets @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that @xmath16 satisfies @xmath0 and @xmath17 satisfies @xmath15 , or , finally , we can also say that this happens if , assuming @xmath18 , the team @xmath13 is the union of two sets @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that @xmath16 satisfies @xmath0 and @xmath17 satisfies @xmath15 . if @xmath13 is a singleton , which corresponds to the classical case , the first two disjunctions are equivalent , but the third is equivalent to @xmath21 . but for non - singleton teams there is a big difference in every respect . these distinctions , leading to different variants of familiar logical operations ,",
    "reveal a hierarchy of logics between the smallest , viz .",
    "classical propositional logic , and the maximal one capable of defining every set of teams .",
    "we characterize these different logics in several ways : first syntactically by their logical operations , and then semantically by the kind of sets of teams they are capable of defining . in several important cases we are able to find complete axiomatizations for these logic .    in our previous paper @xcite we considered sets of teams that are _ downward closed _ in the sense that if a team is in the set , then every subteam is in the set , too . respectively , the logics studied in @xcite have the property that the sets of teams defined by their formulas are downward closed .",
    "we isolated five equivalent logics with this property , all based on some aspect of _",
    "dependence_. in these logics every downward closed set of teams is definable , and the logics have complete axiomatizations .",
    "the axiomatizations are by no means as simple as typical axiomatizations of classical propositional logic , but have still a certain degree of naturality .    in this paper",
    "we consider sets of teams , and related propositional logics , that are not downward closed . a property in a sense opposite to downward closure is closure under ( set - theoretical ) unions .",
    "in fact , a set of teams that is both closed downward and closed under unions is definable in classical propositional logic .",
    "so - called _ inclusion logic _ , to be defined below , is an example of a logic in which definable sets of teams are closed under unions .",
    "so - called _ independence logic _ , also to be defined below , is neither downward closed nor closed under unions .",
    "our methods do not seem to apply to independence logic , we can merely approximate it from below and from above with logics that we understand better .",
    "we do not rule out the possibility that a team is empty .",
    "accordingly we distinguish whether a set of teams contains the empty team as an element or not .",
    "the basic dependence , independence and inclusion logics have the empty team property i.e. every definable set of teams contains the empty team . however , many of our proofs depend on the ability to express the non - emptiness of a team . for this purpose",
    "we also consider a special atomic formula @xmath22 the only role of which is to say that the team is nonempty .",
    "this so - called non - emptiness @xmath22 was introduced in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we give examples which suggest that @xmath22 is not completely alien to common usage of language although it seems hopelessly abstract .",
    "the introduction of @xmath22 leads to two versions of each of our propositional logics : one without @xmath22 and one with @xmath22 .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ premin ]",
    "we define the basic concepts and make some preliminary observations .",
    "we also define the propositional team logics we study in the paper , including _ propositional dependence logic _ , _ propositional independence logic _ , _ propositional union closed logic _ , _ propositional inclusion logic _ and _ propositional team logic _ as well as the strong version of each . in section",
    "[ pisec : nf ] we establish basic normal forms and use them to obtain semantic characterizations of our logics , whether strong or not . in section [ sec : meta_prop ] we prove some metalogical properties of our logics , including compactness and the closure under classical substitutions of the logics . in section  [ axioma ]",
    "we establish complete axiomatizations of the strong versions of our logics .",
    "several open problems are listed in the concluding section  [ conc ] .",
    "our propositional team logic follows the pattern set forth on first - order level by _ dependence logic _",
    "@xcite , _ independence logic _ @xcite , as well as inclusion and exclusion logics @xcite .",
    "the concepts of dependence and independence were earlier introduced in database theory , starting with @xcite . however , in database theory the focus is on dependence and independence of attributes per se , while we take the dependence and independence as atomic formulas and use logical operations to build complex formulas .",
    "the benefit of considering complex formulas is that we can express very involved types of dependence and independence .",
    "a good example is the fact that first - order inclusion logic can express in finite models exactly all dependencies expressible in fixed point logic @xcite .",
    "we follow here the reasoning of wilfrid hodges @xcite to the effect that a set of valuations , rather than a single valuation , permits the delineation of dependence and independence .",
    "we call such sets _",
