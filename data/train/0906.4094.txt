    "in the present work , we investigate nonlinear localized modes resulting from configuration heterogeneity in granular crystals .",
    "this entails a confluence of three key research themes : intrinsic localization through nonlinearity , wave propagation in granular chains , and localization through extrinsic disorder .",
    "intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) , otherwise known as discrete breathers , have been a central theme for numerous theoretical and experimental studies over the past two decades @xcite .",
    "the original theoretical proposal of ilms in prototypical settings such as anharmonic nonlinear lattices @xcite and the rigorous proof of their existence under fairly general conditions @xcite motivated numerous studies of such modes in a diverse host of applications , including optical waveguides and photorefractive crystals @xcite , the denaturation of the dna double strand @xcite , micromechanical cantilever arrays @xcite , nanomechanical resonators @xcite , superconducting josephson junctions @xcite , as well as bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and electrical lattices @xcite , among many others .    one - dimensional ( 1d ) granular crystals , consisting of closely - packed chains of elastically interacting particles , have drawn considerable attention during the past few years .",
    "this broad interest has arisen from the wealth of available material types / sizes and the ability to tune their dynamic response to encompass linear , weakly nonlinear , and strongly nonlinear regimes @xcite .",
    "such flexibility makes them perfect candidates for many engineering applications , including shock and energy absorbing layers @xcite , actuating devices @xcite , and sound scramblers @xcite .",
    "because of these possibilities , it is crucial to investigate the effects of defects ( imhomogeneities , beads with different masses , etc . ) , allowing the observation of interesting physical responses such as fragmentation , anomalous reflections , and energy trapping @xcite .",
    "it is well - known from solid - state physics that localized vibrations in linear lattices can arise from extrinsic disorder that breaks the discrete translational invariance of a perfect crystal lattice @xcite .",
    "such `` disorder '' is also well known to introduce interesting wave - scattering effects @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology arises in a wide host of physical applications , including superconductors @xcite , electron - phonon interactions @xcite , light propagation in dielectric super - lattices with embedded defect layers @xcite , defect modes in photonic crystals @xcite , and optical waveguide arrays  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we aim to investigate the confluence of the preceding research themes by examining the interplay of `` disorder '' , which induces localized modes , and nonlinearity in granular crystals .",
    "we notice in passing that the interaction of impurities with solitary waves or a continuous oscillatory signal in non - loaded ( i.e. , without precompression ) monomer chains has been investigated numerically @xcite as well as experimentally in the recent work of @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "localized oscillations result from the presence of an impurity of lighter mass than the remaining chain particles , during the interaction of the impurity with either a solitary wave or a continuous oscillatory signal .",
    "however , these localized oscillations were all transient , fading away as soon as the wave left the vicinity of the impurity .    here , by contrast , we examine _ long - lived _ localized breathing oscillations , which form robust nonlinear localized modes ( nlms ) induced by the impurities , in strongly - compressed granular chains .",
    "we demonstrate that their frequency depends not only on experimental parameters such as the precompressive force and the constitution ( material and size ) of the impurity bead but also on the inherent nonlinearity of the system ( i.e. , the amplitude of the oscillations ) .",
    "we provide a detailed bifurcation and dynamical analysis of a monoatomic chain with a single lower - mass bead (  impurity \" ) and extend our considerations to monoatomic chains with a pair of lower - mass impurities .",
    "we show that the wave dynamics in the case of nearest neighbor `` impurities '' , which contains consecutive lower - mass beads without other intervening particles , differs substantially from that in the case of larger separations between impurities .",
    "we focus on the case of next - nearest - neighbor impurities , revealing its rich bifurcation structure in which strongly asymmetric branches of solutions emerge through symmetry - breaking .",
    "we monitor the dynamical manifestation of this bifurcation ( and associated instability ) and examine how it is affected by a potential initial asymmetry in the impurity masses .",
    "the remainder of our presentation is structured as follows .",
    "we start by discussing the general theoretical setup of the homogeneous ( no impurity ) model .",
    "we then perform linear and nonlinear analyses , first for monoatomic chains with a single impurity and then for monoatomic chains with a pair of impurities .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings and present some possible future directions .",
    "the interaction between two adjacent elastic spheres is well - known to be described by hertz s law @xcite .",
    "the relation between the force @xmath0 exerted on two identical spheres and the distance @xmath1 between their centers results from geometric effects and is given by the nonlinear relation @xmath2 where @xmath3 @xmath4 is the radius of the beads , @xmath5 is the material s elastic ( young s ) modulus , and @xmath6 is the poisson ratio of the bead material .",
    "the dynamics of a 1d chain composed of beads of a single type ( i.e. , a monoatomic chain ) is thus described by the following system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations @xcite : @xmath7_+^{3/2 } - a[\\delta_{0}+u_{i } - u_{i+1}]_+^{3/2 } \\ , , %    a & = \\frac{2e\\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^{1/2}}{3\\left(1-\\nu^2\\right)}\\ , ,    \\label{model}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the displacement of the @xmath9th bead from its equilibrium position in the initially - compressed chain , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the mass of the beads .",
    "the bracket @xmath12_+$ ] of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) takes the value @xmath13 if @xmath14 and the value @xmath15 if @xmath16 , which signifies that adjacent beads are not in contact .",
    "in contrast with ref .",
    "@xcite , which considered unloaded chains , we investigate strongly precompressed chains , in which @xmath17 takes large values . considering small amplitude displacements in comparison with the initial ones caused by the precompression force , namely @xmath18 one can taylor expand the forces in a power series , in which case keeping the displacement terms to fourth order leads to the approximate (  @xmath19 \" ) model form @xmath20 where @xmath21 the equations of motion ( [ k2k3k4 ] ) are an example of the celebrated fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) model @xcite .",
    "if we restrict our consideration to very small amplitudes and velocities , we can neglect all of the nonlinear terms from the equations of motion and keep only the harmonic ( @xmath22 ) term .",
    "the spectral band of the ensuing linear chain has an upper cutoff frequency of @xmath23 , which corresponds to the lattice vibration in which the neighboring particles oscillate out of phase .",
    "one of the remarkable features of gradually introducing nonlinearity is that its interplay with discreteness leads to the emergence of localized modes even in the absence of any inhomogeneity .",
    "such ilm solutions are generic features of a large class of hamiltonian lattices ( which includes the fpu model ) @xcite .",
    "ilms have been studied extensively in monoatomic fpu chains @xcite .",
    "one of the canonical mechanisms for the generation of these nonlinear localized modes , is the modulational instability ( mi ) of the band edge plane wave .",
    "a detailed analysis of this instability ( bifurcation ) has shown that the mi of the upper cutoff mode manifests itself when the following inequality holds ( see sec .",
    "@xmath24 of @xcite and references therein ) @xmath25 using eqs .",
    "( [ k2k3k4coef ] ) one can show that the above mentioned inequality does nt hold in our setting , which , in turn , indicates that small amplitude ilms bifurcating from the upper band mode do nt exist in monoatomic granular crystals .",
    "( the existence of dark discrete breathers or large amplitude dbs remains an interesting open question for future investigations ) .",
    "consider a 1d monoatomic chain of beads that contains an impurity at the @xmath26th site .",
    "suppose that the impurity ( the @xmath26th bead ) is made of the same material as the other particles but has a different radius .",
    "in particular , we choose the homogeneous host chain composed of spherical stainless steel beads of non - magnetic , 316 type ( which have elastic modulus @xmath27 gpa , poisson ratio @xmath28 , and density @xmath29 kg / m@xmath30 @xcite ) of radius @xmath31 mm and a spherical steel impurity bead with some other radius .",
    "we treat the radius of the impurity as a free parameter , though in most cases we will use the radius @xmath32 .",
    "we also suppose that the granular chain is compressed by an experimentally - accessible static force of @xmath33 n.    the presence of the impurity bead in the chain gives rise to a mass defect and leads to changes in the force constants that destroy the discrete translational symmetry of the crystal .",
    "recalling that the precompressive static force @xmath17 induces an initial displacement @xmath1 between neighboring spheres of the same diameter and defining @xmath34 to be the displacement that it induces between neighboring spheres of different diameter , equations of motion ( [ model ] ) at sites @xmath35 , @xmath26 , and @xmath36 become @xmath37_+^{3/2 } - a_2[\\delta_{1}+u_{k-1 } - u_{k}]_+^{3/2 } \\ , , \\notag \\\\",

    "this yields @xmath40    seeking stationary solutions with frequency @xmath41 , we substitute @xmath42 for all @xmath43 into eqs .",
    "( [ model2 ] ) and obtain the following eigenvalue problem : @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xmath46    the eigenvalue problem ( [ eval ] ) determines the spectrum of the extended phonon excitations and of the localized defect mode centered at the impurity site . in general , the presence of impurity beads can create two types of vibrational modes :    1 .   _ resonance modes _",
    ", when the mass of the impurity bead is larger than the mass of the rest ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "2 .   _ localized modes _ , in the opposite case ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "each resonance mode has a frequency within the range of frequencies that constitute the phonon band of the homogeneous host crystal and has a vibration amplitude that is larger in the vicinity of the impurity bead .",
    "each localized mode , on the other hand , has a frequency @xmath49 that lies above the band of the normal modes frequencies of the homogeneous host crystal and , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ 1defectlinear ] ) , has a vibration amplitude that is large at the impurity site but decreases very rapidly with increasing distance .",
    "reference @xcite used multiple - scale analysis to obtain the analytical approximation @xmath50 for @xmath49 .",
    "it is important to observe that our setting is very different from the one in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the experimental setup in @xcite has no precompression , so a travelling envelope moves over the defect site .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this pulse acts as a `` local precompression force '' as it travels , which makes the system weakly nonlinear locally and results in localized oscillations at the impurity site .",
    "by contrast , in the present setting , the chain is strongly compressed by a static force , which acts globally in a nonlinear fashion and allows localized modes to be maintained indefinitely without further external excitations after they are excited initially ( by , e.g. , an actuator or the impact of a striker particle ) .",
    "the above distinction between local and global forces is the key difference that leads to very long - lived localized oscillations around the impurity bead .",
    "such oscillations can last arbitrarily long in principle , but in laboratory experiments the presence of dissipative effects will eventually result in the attenuation of these localized modes @xcite .    as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "1defectlinear](b ) , we find excellent agreement between the analytical expression of eq .",
    "( [ job_prediction ] ) and the frequency of the localized mode obtained by the eigenvalue system ( [ eval ] ) up to radii ratios @xmath51 ( see also fig .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , for the material parameters and the precompressive force discussed above , an impurity bead of radius @xmath52 ( for which @xmath53 ) yields a localized mode with frequency @xmath54 khz , whereas eq .",
    "( [ job_prediction ] ) predicts @xmath55 khz . on the other hand , for @xmath32 ( implying that @xmath56 ) , the eigenvalue system ( [ eval ] ) gives @xmath57 khz and eq .",
    "( [ job_prediction ] ) predicts @xmath58 khz . to provide additional context , we remark that the upper cutoff frequency of the precompressed homogeneous host crystal is given by @xmath59 khz .",
    "it is clear that the analytical expression in eq .",
    "( [ job_prediction ] ) is expected to be a good approximation only for @xmath60 .",
    "otherwise , one has to use the numerically - obtained frequency @xmath49 .",
    "additionally , as the radius of the impurity bead becomes smaller , the difference between the frequency @xmath49 of the impurity - induced localized mode and the upper cutoff frequency becomes larger .",

    ", this will allow us to examine the interplay of nonlinearity and `` disorder '' .",
    "when a perfect nonlinear lattice supports ilms , the presence of impurities can drastically change the properties of such localized modes , resulting in interesting phenomena such as the presence of asymmetric impurity modes in nonlinear lattices with a light - mass defect @xcite , or the existence of stable , nonlinear , heavy - mass impurity modes @xcite . as we have mentioned , our nonlinear lattice does not support ilms [ see the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) ] , so the aforementioned phenomena are not expected to be present .",
    "however , the linear localization at the defect in conjunction with nonlinearity can result in the presence of robust nlms .    more specifically",
    ", it is important to consider whether the nonlinearity of the chain can support the existence of localized modes with frequencies @xmath65 . in the linear limit , the chain does not support vibrations with frequencies in this regime . to answer that question",

[ 1defectlinear](a ) ) , as this was obtained from the linear eigenvalue problem ( [ eval ] ) .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated the formation of localized modes due to the interplay of nonlinearity and disorder ( i.e. , the presence of defects ) in granular crystals .",
    "while previous research has been dedicated to the computational and experimental identification of such modes @xcite , we believe that the present work is the first one to identify such modes in a _ numerically exact _ form and offer a systematic analysis of their linear stability . we have argued that these localized modes are likely to be absent in monoatomic chains , and we have illustrated that the inclusion of even a single defect can produce a linear defect mode whose interplay with nonlinearity generates a full branch of such solutions .",
    "we have demonstrated that these waves are robust , and it should be straightforward to generate them in experiments for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "we extended our single - defect investigation to multi - defect settings , for which we examined the prototypical situation of crystals with two defect sites .",
    "we identified a much richer phenomenology in such situations , as we observed families of both near - symmetric and near - antisymmetric states .",
    "we subsequently demonstrated that the latter yields additional families of asymmetric solutions through pitchfork - like bifurcations , which we analyzed for defect pairs containing both identical and distinct impurities .",
    "although this paper presents some of the first steps towards a systematic understanding and classification of localized breathing modes in granular crystals , there are numerous interesting future directions that should be pursued .",
    "first , one can consider progressively larger numbers of defects .",
    "by analogy with nls settings @xcite , we expect this to reveal not only a wealth of additional phenomenology ( e.g. , new families of waves and more complicated bifurcation structures ) but also implications for how things progress toward the infinite defect limit .",
    "if all defects occur only as next - nearest - neighbors , we would obtain a perfect diatomic ( two species ) crystal in this limit .",
    "such a crystal is naturally expected to support intrinsic localized mode solutions in the band gap between its acoustic and optical bands .",
    "indeed , our preliminary results indicate that such gap breather solutions do indeed arise .",
    "the detailed examination of such modes , and their higher - dimensional generalizations ( including possibly gap vortex modes @xcite ) , are among our future goals .",
