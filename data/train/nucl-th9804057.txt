    "the present paper is part of a sequence discussing the general properties of three - body halos @xcite .",
    "these papers all deal with three - body systems , weakly bound and spatially extended compared to the energy and range of the two - body interactions @xcite .",
    "most of the detailed information about halo nuclei is obtained from reaction experiments @xcite .",
    "fragmentation reactions of three - body halo nuclei were studied in the sudden approximation for @xmath4li and @xmath10he with special emphasis on the effects of final state interactions , which in other words are the effects of the two - body continuum @xcite .",
    "borromean systems , where no binary subsystem is bound , are particularly interesting three - body halo candidates .",
    "they have by definition a relatively low binding energy .",
    "the established nuclear prototypes are @xmath10he ( n+n+@xmath2 ) and @xmath4li ( n+n+@xmath11li ) and other examples are expected further up along the neutron dripline .",
    "the structure of @xmath10he is fairly well understood whereas the structure of @xmath4li is still controversial .",
    "the reason is essentially the large amount of knowledge , respectively the lack of knowledge , about the two - body subsystems .",
    "the number of bound states for borromean systems is almost always limited to the ground state .",
    "the effective two - body interactions must be weak enough to exclude bound states and strong enough to bind the three - body system .",
    "therefore one or more two - body resonances must be present at low energy .",
    "then the low - lying continuum three - body spectrum would inevitably have rather complicated structure .",
    "this has strong implications for the analyses and the understanding of the data accumulating from experiments with nuclear halos and borromean nuclei @xcite .",
    "the three - body continuum problem has been the subject of numerous investigations and tremendous progress has been achieved in recent years @xcite .",
    "however , a number of problems still remain and unfortunately they include reliable computations of borromean continuum spectra @xcite .",
    "other difficult problems include the continuum three - body coulomb problem @xcite and scattering above threshold of one particle on a two - body bound structure as for example nucleon scattering on deuterons @xcite .",
    "the problems can crudely be divided into those dealing with the more technical aspects like the accuracies of the employed analytical and numerical methods , and physics issues addressing the behavior of the binary subsystems , especially knowledge of the effective two - body interactions .",
    "it is necessary , but not always easy , to distinguish between these difficulties .",
    "different treatments are usually needed for short - range and long - range interactions and for energies below or above possible two - body thresholds .",
    "the concepts and problems described above are to a large extent general and of interest in other subfields of physics @xcite .",
    "the general discussions of structure and break - up reactions of halo nuclei should be extended to the three - body continuum .",
    "specific investigations are available , but imprecise @xcite .",
    "the technical difficulties formulated in coordinate space are related to the necessary computation of the behavior of the effective potential at large - distance .",
    "fortunately , a method treating the large distances analytically and the short distances numerically has recently become available @xcite .",
    "the method is very powerful in structure calculations as demonstrated by the succesful investigation of the efimov effect @xcite .",
    "however , the implementation has so far essentially concentrated on bound structures , but generalization to applications in the three - body continuum is straightforward .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to ( i ) describe the details of a method to compute low - energy three - body continuum spectra for particles with or without intrinsic spin , ( ii ) derive asymptotic large - distance expressions allowing simple computations of the corresponding effective three - body potential for arbitrary angular momenta and arbitrary short - range two - body potentials , ( iii ) apply the method in detailed realistic numerical computations of the continuum structure and various observables for @xmath10he and @xmath4li .",
    "the paper generalizes first the analytic results obtained for @xmath0-waves and square well potentials @xcite .",
    "then the method is applied to detailed studies of the continuum structure for the borromean nuclei @xmath10he ( n+n+@xmath12he ) and @xmath4li ( n+n+@xmath5li ) .",
    "brief reports describing some numerical results are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "after the introduction we give in section 2 a general description of the method and then we concentrate on two cases of special interest . in section 3 and 4",
    "we compute in details the properties of @xmath10he and @xmath4li , respectively . in section 5",
    "we give a brief summary and the conclusions . a convenient general expression for the transformation between different sets of jacoby coordinates",
    "is derived in the appendix .",
    "we shall consider a system of three interacting inert `` particles '' .",
    "their intrinsic degrees of freedom are frozen and only the three - body ( halo ) degrees of freedom shall be treated here . in this section",
    "we first describe the general method of solving the faddeev equations using hyperspherical coordinates .",
    "in particular we specify the boundary conditions at large distances by introducing the @xmath9-matrix or equivalently the @xmath13-matrix .",
    "the angular equations at large distances are then treated essentially analytically .",
    "we then consider a system of two identical neutrons surrounding a core first with finite spin and then with spin zero . finally in this section we give the expressions for strength functions and coulomb dissociation cross sections .",

    "thus two - body polarization effects are already included via the effective two - body interaction .",
    "the remaining part must then involve all three particles simultaneously polarizing each other and therefore only effective at small @xmath23-values .",

    "the range of the three - body force is by its definition related to the hyperradius . for @xmath1he , @xmath23=2 fm and 3 fm correspond roughly to configurations where the neutrons respectively are at the surface of the @xmath235particle and outside the surface by an amount equal to their own radius .",

    "this is not needed , because we use the asymptotic solutions as soon as they are accurate enough .",
    "this improves both accuracy and speed of the computations .",
    "the finite size of the basis gives a too fast convergence to the hyperspherical spectrum . without an independent calculation it can therefore be difficult to assess the accuracy .",

    "for all six cases in fig .",
    "2 we find pockets which , except for the @xmath252 ground state , are unable to bind the system , but still responsible for several low - lying @xmath9-matrix poles as we shall see later .",
    "the pauli principle prohibits the core neutrons and the halo neutrons from occupying the same orbits .",
    "this has to be incorporated explicitly , since the three - body model only deals with particles without intrinsic degrees of freedom , except for their intrinsic spins . for a repulsive @xmath0-wave potential",
    "as described above , no bound state is present and no overlap has to be excluded .",
    "we also investigate another approximation where we use an attractive neutron - core potential with one bound @xmath0-state and the same scattering length and effective range .",
    "the lowest angular eigenvalue must then bend over and diverge parabolically towards @xmath253 .",
    "this corresponds at large distances to a configuration where a neutron is bound in the doubly degenerate lowest @xmath0-state , which is pauli forbidden for the halo neutrons . at smaller distances the probability , or the wave function , must be small , because otherwise a significant part of the halo wave function would be inside the core , the halo and core degrees of freedom would not separate and the three - body model would not be a good approximation .",
    "the effective potential at these small distances is then rather unimportant if the model is valid .",
