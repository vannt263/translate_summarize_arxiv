    "restitutive forces in an incompressible fluid give rise to the development of waves when the fluid is slightly perturbed from its state of rest .",
    "that is the case of inertial waves in rotating fluids , inertial gravity waves in stratified fluids , or alfvn waves in conducting fluids .",
    "however , when the perturbation is large , the system can develop far from equilibrium dynamics , with the waves coexisting with eddies in a fully developed turbulent flow .",
    "in such a case , and when the wave period is much faster than the turnover time of the waves , wave turbulence theories can be used to predict the scaling laws followed by the system @xcite .    in the case of rotating flows , the presence of background rotation breaks down isotropy , and a preferred direction arises along the axis of rotation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result of a selection of triadic interaction by resonant waves , energy is preferentially transferred towards modes in fourier space in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis @xcite .",
    "the transfer of energy , besides becoming anisotropic , is also slowed down , resulting in a steeper energy spectrum than in the isotropic and homogeneous case @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , wave turbulence theories can be separated into theories of weak and of strong turbulence . in the former case ,",
    "the assumption of weak nonlinearities results in decorrelation between the modes being governed by linear dispersion , and the equations can be closed to obtain exact spectral solutions . for rotating turbulence , the theory of weak turbulence predicts an axisymmetric energy spectrum @xmath6 @xcite , but this theory only applies to a subset of modes dominated by waves . moreover , as energy may be transfered outside this subset of modes at finite time , whether the turbulence can remain weak in rotating flows has been a matter of debate @xcite . in the latter case , theories of strong turbulence can describe modes with eddy turnover time of the order of the wave period ( although not the modes with zero frequency in the waves ) , and give a more complete description of the flow , but rely on phenomenological approximations to obtain energy spectra that are positive definite @xcite .    numerical simulations and experiments give results that in some cases are consistent with some of the predictions of wave turbulence theories @xcite , but the strength and relevance of the waves is hard to quantify . in this paper",
    "we quantify the strength of inertial waves and their impact on the turbulent dynamics of rotating flows in numerical simulations in periodic boxes by two means : ( 1 ) we compute wave number and frequency spectra , in which the dispersion relation of the waves can be directly observed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . using these spectra , the amount of energy in waves and in eddies can be discriminated .",
    "( 2 ) we compute time correlation functions of individual modes in fourier space , to identify the relevant decorrelation time depending on the scale .",
    "besides the analysis presented here to identify the role of the waves in setting the dominant timescale in a rotating flow , it is important to note that a proper understanding of decorrelation times in turbulence is relevant for many applications , as well as for other theoretical approaches to turbulence .",
    "a somewhat different approach to study turbulence in the presence of waves is that of rapid distortion theory ( rdt ) . in rdt ,",
    "the presence of a time scale in the fluid which is much shorter than the turnover time ( or the decorrelation time ) of the large scale eddies allows certain magnitudes in a turbulent flow to be computed using linear theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews , and @xcite for the specific case of rotating turbulence ) .",
    "time correlation functions and decorrelation times were computed before for rotating fluids , with the focus on their relevance to predict the acoustic emission produced by a turbulent flow , and on the effect of flow anisotropy in the decorrelation time @xcite . for magnetohydrodynamic flows , time correlation functions and decorrelation times",
    "were recently computed in @xcite . in isotropic and homogeneous turbulence , a proper understanding of the decorrelation time",
    "is needed to correctly obtain the frequency spectrum from the kolmogorov spectrum in terms of wavenumbers @xcite . in this latter case ,",
    "the dominant timescale for all modes is the sweeping time , associated with the interactions of the small - scale eddies with the large - scale energy containing eddies @xcite .",
    "finally , time correlation functions are also important in turbulence closure models , for the dynamics of lagrangian particles @xcite , and for the computation of turbulent diffusion of passive scalars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
