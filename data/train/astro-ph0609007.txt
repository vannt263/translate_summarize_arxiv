    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) mechanisms are often invoked to explain the launching , acceleration and collimation of jets from young stellar objects , x - ray binaries , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , microquasars , and quasars ( see , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "strongly magnetized jets , particularly those with a strong toroidal field encircling the collimated flow , are often referred to as `` current - carrying '' or `` poynting flux - dominated '' ( pfd ) jets .",
    "a large current flowing parallel to the jet flow is responsible for generating a strong , tightly wound helical magnetic field .",
    "the global picture of a current - carrying jet with a closed current system linking the magnetosphere of the central engine and the hot spots was introduced by @xcite and applied to agn double radio sources .",
    "this closed current system includes a pair of current circuits , each containing both a forward electric current path ( the jet flow itself , with its toroidal magnetic field , toward the lobe ) , and a return electric current path ( along some path back to the agn core ) .",
    "recent high resolution observations , in x - ray , optical and radio bands , show that many agn and quasar jets display wiggles / kinks , which may be associated with a helical motion of the underlying bulk flow , in wide spatial ranges from sub - parsec to kpc scales ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "many ideas have been proposed for these helical distortions : mhd instabilities such as the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) , the current - driven instability ( cdi ) , and the pressure - driven instability ( pdi ) , or the precession of the jet ejection axis due to the existence of a binary black hole @xcite , or an encounter with another galactic core .",
    "it is well known that a cylindrical plasma column with a helical magnetic configuration is subject to the @xmath1 ( sausage ) mode of pdi , the @xmath0 ( kink ) mode of cdi , and the other higher order modes , where @xmath2 is the azimuthal ( @xmath3 ) mode number ( see , _",

    "cdi is driven by parallel ( axial ) current flows and can exist even in a zero pressure , force - free plasma . on the other hand ,",
    "pdi is powered by perpendicular current flows and it is often known as the interchange ( internal ) modes .",
    "khi is considered to be very important at the shearing boundary between the flowing jet and the external medium , particularly in the kinetic flux - dominated ( kfd ) jets . in principle ,",
    "cdi and khi have both external ( surface ) and internal ( body ) modes .",
    "pfd jets should be especially susceptible to cdi rather than pdi and khi .",
    "this is because the strong axial electric current is present inside the pfd jets , which is responsible for the highly wound helical field configurations , and the lorentz force plays an important role in the jet dynamics .",
    "the investigation of the destructive influence of cdi on pfd jet flows is an important avenue of research in the study of astrophysical jets .",
    "much more attention on studies of stabilities ( disruption of the interior / exterior of astrophysical jets ) have given to khi than to cdi .",
    "this is because jets were believed to be super - alfvnic or super - fast magnetosonic kfd flows ( _ i.e. _ , kinetic energy was expected to greatly exceed the magnetic energy ) .",
    "however , it is not necessarily always the case ; a super - alfvnic or super - fast magnetosonic pfd flow can exist in both nonrelativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite mhd outflow solutions .",
    "analytic studies on the cdi as a possible explanation for jet disruption have been performed as well @xcite .",
    "linear analyses of nonrelativistic force - free jets , which are thermally confined by the external nonmagnetized medium , were performed in super - fast @xcite or trans - fast @xcite magnetosonic regimes .",
    "they found that the growth rate of cdi is always substantially smaller that those of khi in their specific treatment .",
    "only for quite small fast magnetosonic numbers , @xmath4 , both become comparable .",
    "linear analyses of the relativistic force - free jets , in case of constant - longitudinal field @xmath5 along the jet axis , were performed by @xcite .",
    "they concluded that such a jet is stable against cdi , while @xcite analyzed the relativistic force - free jets with @xmath5 decreasing outwards and found that they are unstable .",
    "nonlinear development of the cdi for cold super - fast magnetosonic jets has been studied by @xcite , based on the linear analysis @xcite .",
    "it was found that the current density is redistributed within the inner part of the jet radius on a characteristic time scale of the order of the alfvn crossing time in the jet frame .",
    "nothing in their numerical results indicated a possible disruption of the jet by the cdi sausage ( @xmath1 ) or kink ( @xmath0 ) modes ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in general , these linear / nonlinear considerations conclude that `` current - driven instabilities are unlikely to be dangerous for the integrity of astrophysical jets '' @xcite and",
    "this has been widely accepted in theoretical / observational communities . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", an interplay between khi and cdi can occur in the helically magnetized flow even with slightly super - fast magnetosonic speed @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this nonlinear interaction can contribute to jet survival , and the large - scale magnetic deformations associated with the cdi mode development can effectively saturate khi surface vortices and prevent jet disruption .    by contrast , the first attempt to investigate the nonlinear behavior of visible distortion in kfd jets along the large - scale magnetic field by the cdi kink mode was performed by @xcite to model herbig haro objects . in a similar study , @xcite examined the formation of wiggled structures by the @xmath0 mode in pfd jets to apply for agn jets .",
    "their numerical result is applicable for the systematic distribution of the observed rotation measure in 3c 449 @xcite , associated with the jet deformation @xcite .",
    "the rotating pfd / kfd jets can be potentially stabilized against the @xmath0 mode beyond the original kruskal - shafranov criterion , however , sudden destabilization of rotating jets due to the @xmath0 mode can occur via the angular momentum loss triggered by mhd shock waves @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss the stability properties of `` magnetic tower '' jets , which have not been studied in the past work .",
    "of particular interest here is the nonlinear growth of the cdi kink mode .",
    "the cdi kink mode in magnetic tower jets may be distinguished from that in the classical mhd jets along the large - scale magnetic field @xcite , while it should be comparable directly to `` non - disrupting '' models @xcite , in which the mhd jets are assumed to be in pressure equilibrium with an unmagnetized ambient medium .",
    "this is the third of our series of papers to examine the nonlinear magnetic tower jets .",

    "* hereafter paper ii ) investigated the global structure of magnetic tower jets in the gravitationally stratified atmosphere ( a more realistic astrophysical situation ) , in terms of the mhd waves structure , the radial force equilibrium , and the collimation .",
    "in the present paper , the third of our series , we investigate the stability properties of magnetic tower jets .",
    "we examine our numerical results in two cases ; one without initial perturbations and another with initial perturbations .",
    "the former exhibits the quasi - axisymmetric evolution without any growth of mhd instabilities , while the latter shows non - axisymmetric evolution by the cdi modes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we outline our numerical methods . in  3 , we describe our numerical results .",
    "discussion and conclusion are given in  4 and  5 .",
    "we solve the nonlinear system of time - dependent ideal mhd equations numerically in a 3-d cartesian coordinate system @xmath7 .",
    "the basic numerical treatments ( including the mhd numerical scheme ) is essentially the same as that in paper i and ii . we assume an initial hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitationally stratified medium , adopting an iso - thermal king model @xcite .",
    "the magnetic flux and the mass are steadily injected in a central small volume during a certain time period .",
    "since the injected magnetic fields are not force - free , they will evolve as a `` magnetic tower '' and interact with the ambient medium .      in this paper",

    "the injections of magnetic flux , mass and its associated energies are the same as those described in paper i. the ratio between the toroidal to poloidal fluxes of the injected fields is characterized by a parameter @xmath51 , which corresponds to @xmath52 times more toroidal flux than poloidal flux .",

[ [ eq : k - s_limit ] ] ) then becomes @xmath83 so that wavelengths greater than @xmath84 could be unstable to the cdi kink mode .      to better diagnose the non - axisymmetric distortion , we perform the power spectrum analysis of the magnitude of the current density @xmath85 . we analyze the modal structure of @xmath85 by performing the volume - averaged fourier transform : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the cylindrical volume that encloses @xmath89 @xmath90 we use the values @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 in the `` upper '' volume and use @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the `` lower '' volume .",

    "for the surface modes , we inspect the transverse distribution of the bulk flow speed @xmath171 , the density @xmath33 , and the magnetic field strength @xmath172 .",
    "two distinct velocity shears ( in both positive and negative @xmath11 regions ) are identified in the @xmath11 direction on @xmath170 ( _ upper - left _ ) ; an outer part @xmath173 and an inner part @xmath174 . at the outer part , @xmath175 and @xmath176 and at the inner part , @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , the inequality @xmath179 is satisfied .",
    "similarly , we can see many distinct velocity shears in the _ upper - right _ panel .",
    "however , even in these shears , we confirm that the inequality @xmath180 still holds everywhere .",
    "this indicates that the khi surface modes are completely stabilized , because there is no significant velocity shear exceeding the local surface alfvn speed in the transverse ( @xmath11 ) direction . for the body modes , we inspect the transverse distribution of the bulk flow speed @xmath171 , the alfvn speed , and the quantity @xmath181 . inside the magnetic tower ,",
    "the plasma @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) is always less than unity during the time evolution .",
    "therefore , the phase speed of the mhd fast mode wave is equal ( in the local magnetic field direction ) or larger ( in the oblique direction of the local magnetic field ) than the alfvn speed , @xmath184 . as seen in both _",
    "panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : khistable ] , the bulk flow speed is always extremely sub - alfvnic , and furthermore , the inequality @xmath185 is also satisfied in the `` body '' part of the magnetic tower jet .",
    "these indicate that the khi body modes are suppressed as well .",
    "we conclude that the khi modes play no role and the normal cdi modes create the non - axisymmetric structures in our results .      as examined in ",
    "[ sec : a ] , the unperturbed magnetic tower jet can be stabilized against the cdi kink mode beyond the k - s criterion .",
    "one of the certain mechanisms of the stabilizing effect , which we can identfy in our unperturbed case , is the dynamical relaxation of magnetic twists .",
    "however , this process may contribute the _ marginal stabilization _ under an ideal situation ( no perturbation except for the numerical noise is assumed as an initial condition ) . if the system is perturbed randomly with a finite amplitude ( a few percent of the local sound speed ) , then the non - axisymmetric ( @xmath186 ) internal / external cdi modes can grow .",
    "the disturbances in the system are reasonable ( especially when related to possible astrophysical situations ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic tower jet in our treatments , will eventually be subject to cdi . here",
    ", we give further discussions on the stabilities of magnetic tower jets .      in the solar coronal magnetic loops",
    ", it is well known that the line - tying effect at the foot points ( chromosphere ) can raise the original k - s stability threshold ( dense materials can prevent the radial motion of twisted magnetic fluxes ) .",
    "how about the case in the astrophysical jets ?",
    "anchored magnetic fluxes to the accretion disk and/or stellar / black hole surfaces may be considered as a semi ( one side ) line - tying boundary condition in a certain dynamical stage .",
    "an important clue to this can be derived from laboratory experiments of magnetic towers @xcite .",
    "their quasi `` force - free '' magnetic towers can exhibit the systematic @xmath0 distortion when the current - carrying system satisfies the original k - s limit .",
    "it might be unlikely that such a semi line - tying effect can stabilize the jet even in the astrophysical situation . in our global modeling of magnetic tower jets",
    ", we do not solve the evolution of the central region ( an accretion disk , etc . ) .",
    "therefore , we can not apply it directly to the agn central region .",
    "it is still an open issue whether a semi line - tying effect can work or not in the real astrophysical jets .      as discussed in paper ii , the `` forward ''",
    "current - carrying column @xmath154 never reaches a force - free equilibrium .",
    "instead , it will be supported by the outward - directed , local ( core of the magnetic towers ) pressure gradient force : @xmath187 during a dynamical evolution ( see fig . 10 in paper ii ) . in terms of minimization of the mhd energy integral @xcite , a finite gas pressure in the system ( plasma @xmath188 ) can contribute to the stabilization .",
    "however this can be effective when @xmath189 , i.e. , the gas pressure is more dominant than the magnetic pressure ( for @xmath0 kink mode , see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we may not expect a strong stabilization by the pressure in the magnetic tower ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "furthermore , the outward - directed gas pressure gradient itself ( @xmath191 ) actually destabilizes the tower through the pdi ( interchange and/or ballooning ) modes , which is driven by the perpendicular currents ( in contrast to the axial [ parallel ] currents , considered mainly in this paper ) .",
    "we , however , could not find any growth of the pdi modes , in both the unperturbed ( paper ii ) and the perturbed cases , implying no direct contribution of the pressure gradient to the destabilization by the pdi modes ( see next section for more details ) .",
    "also , we can not confirm any direct contributions of the internal thermal pressure effects ( @xmath192 and @xmath193 ) to the destabilization by the cdi internal / external modes .",
    "we next consider the magnetic field configuration in magnetic tower jets . in the context of magnetic controlled fusion systems ,",
    "the helical field configuration in the tower model can be identified as the reversed field pinch ( rfp ) profile as seen in fig .",
    "11 in paper ii .",
    "the axial component @xmath5 has a crucial shear ( its sign reverses from `` + '' to `` - '' ) in the radial direction ( rfp in the context of astrophysical jets , see also * ? ? ?",
    "several stabilization effects in rfp are summarized in @xcite ; ( i ) a hollow or very flat pressure profile ( @xmath194 ) are required near the central ( @xmath13 ) axis to suppress the pdi sausage ( interchange , internal ) mode ( @xmath1 ) , but ( ii ) it can be suppressed when @xmath195 .",
    "this may be the situation in the present paper . as already discussed in the previous section (  [ sec : ds_itp ] ) , a finite pressure gradient exists to contribute to the radial force equilibrium in the core part ( around the central axis ) and this might play a role in driving the pdi modes .",
    "however , the plasma @xmath182 is small ( @xmath196 ) , indicating that the destabilization by the pdi modes may be suppressed due to the small plamsa @xmath182 .",
    "also , ( iii ) the strong @xmath5 shear can prevent the destabilization by the cdi internal / external kink modes ( @xmath0 ) . in our results , this shear may provide the stabilization against the cdi external modes , while it does not affect the cdi internal modes at the lower latitude @xmath197 , as seen in figs . [",
    "fig : mode_power_b3 ] and [ fig : jz_evo ] .",
    "furthermore , the cdi external modes can grow at the higher latitude @xmath155 .",
    "this may be because the strong @xmath198 shear in the radial direction will be relaxed towards the jet axis due to the decreasing external pressure ( expanding the poloidal fluxes to the radial direction ) .",
    "the external gas itself also may affect the stabilization .",
    "the inward - directed , thermal pressure confinement and/or the gravitational contraction of the external unmagnetized gas , which surrounds the magnetic tower jets , may provide some stabilization at least against the growth of external cdi modes , although the internal cdi and pdi modes will not be affected ( for the internal pdi sausage @xmath1 mode , see * ? ? ?",
    "in our results , the external environment may have a similar stabilizing effect on the external cdi modes to the @xmath5 shear , as discussed in the previous section (  [ sec : ds_rfp ] ) , while the internal pdi mode may be suppressed by the low internal pressure . in the magnetic tower jets ,",
    "an external gas plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the cdi external modes . when an external gas pressure profile does not decrease ( constant ) , which is examined in paper i ( see fig .",
    "11 in paper i for a continuous injection case ) , the magnetic tower never expands radially and both the thermal confinement by the external gas and the strong @xmath198 shear will be kept throughout the magnetic tower `` body '' ( no formation of `` lobe '' ) .",
    "therefore , the cdi internal modes may occur , but the cdi external modes should be surpressed .",
    "these are consistent with the cdi `` non - disrupting '' model @xcite as well .",
    "we finally discuss the stabilization by the rotation . in our numerical treatment , we investigate almost `` non - spinning '' magnetic tower jet . from the theoretical point of view , any magnetically driven outflows ( magneto - centrifugal and/or magnetic pressure driven ) can have an azimuthal velocity component .",
    "they possess an angular momentum provided by the accretion disk or kerr black hole magnetosphere . in the classical model of nonrelativistic mhd winds ,",
    "the centrifugal force plays a minor role in the radial force equilibrium far from the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "however , this is only the case in the nonrelativistic treatment . in the relativistic mhd regime ,",
    "the situation will be modified ; semi - analytical solutions of relativistic mhd winds with self - similarity exhibit that the relativistic inertia and electrostatic forces play an important role in the radial force equilibrium at the cylindrical flow structure , extended to pc or larger scales @xcite . braided",
    "emission - line profiles and rotational velocity in ngc 4258 indicate a pure helical motion exists along the tightly wrapped strand even in kpc scales @xcite .",
    "the stabilizing effect of rotation against the cdi kink mode in the spinning nonrelativistic pfd / kfd jets has been investigated by numerical simulations @xcite . because of the centrifugal effect , these spinning jets can be stabilized against the @xmath0 mode beyond the point predicted by the k - s criterion .",
    "the linear stability analysis of the relativistically rotating force - free fields in kerr geometry @xcite has been performed by @xcite .",
    "they also show that the field - line rotation has a stabilizing effect against the kink modes satisfying the k - s criterion . in these cases ,",
    "the presence of an azimuthal velocity component can modify the radial force equilibrium , making the jet robust against the cdi kink mode .",
    "examinations of the stability property in a rotating magnetic tower jet are clearly desirable .",
    "the cdi of current - carrying jets for two types of return current distributions have been discussed : ( 1 ) the return current is assumed to flow within the jet itself ( the jets are thermally confined by the external medium ) @xcite , and ( 2 ) the return current is assumed to flow around the jet , such as in a magnetized cocoon @xcite . most of the theoretical / numerical works have been devoted to the former case , in which the forward current @xmath118 and the return current @xmath199 are concentrated at the interfaces between the jet and ism / igm , which is taken to be `` unmagnetized '' .",
    "in this situation , the growth of external cdi modes can be effectively suppressed , while the excitations of only internal cdi modes are allowed .",
    "there is no radial displacement at the edge of the current - carrying column by the internal cdi modes , and therefore , it may be difficult to explain the off - set axial distortion of observed jets by these internal modes . as described in  [ sec : int ] , this is one of the reasons why much less attention has been paid to the cdi than to the khi for the stability problems in astrophysical jets to explain the disrupted jet exterior .",
    "however , in the gravitationally stratified atmosphere , the effect of thermal confinement on the edge of the current - carrying column will get gradually weaker as the magnetic tower grows . as a result ,",
    "a separation of current flowing paths between @xmath154 and @xmath200 occurs , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : jz_evo ] .",
    "this implies that the edge of @xmath154 _ becomes a free boundary _ against the cdi external modes , even when it is embedded deeply inside the external , unmagnetized gas .",
    "furthermore , the region between the outside of @xmath154 and the inside of @xmath199 becomes nearly force - free @xmath201 .",
    "therefore , the cdi external modes can grow in a dynamical time scale to form the systematic wiggles .",
    "this is also true even in the spinning pfd / kfd jets under the large - scale magnetic field @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "even if the gas pressure in the external , unmagnetized gas is high enough to suppress the growth of the cdi external kink mode , then the cdi internal kink mode can grow to form the internal non - axisymmetric structure , as we exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : jz_evo ] .",
    "therefore , we believe that the external cdi modes are one of the possible mechanisms to explain the disruption of current - carrying mhd jets and it could be applied to the wiggling agn jets .",
    "stability properties of magnetic tower jets have been examined by performing 3-d mhd simulations .",
    "our numerical results show that the magnetic tower jets in the gravitationally stratified atmosphere could survive the current - driven kink instability beyond the kruskal - shafranov criterion even in the nonlinear regime .",
    "one of the potentially stabilizing effects on a traditionally unstable magnetic field may be due to the dynamical relaxation of magnetic twists in the propagating magnetic tower jets .",
    "this causes an increased threshold of the unstable critical wavelength .    however , the magnetic tower jets are eventually distorted by the non - axisymmetric perturbations with a few percent of the local sound speed in the system .",
    "the current - driven kink modes grow predominantly on time scales of the order of the local alfvn crossing time @xmath202 . in the gravitationally stratified atmosphere ,",
    "two types of kink modes appears : the internal and external modes . at a large distance away from the central region , the external kink mode grows , while only the internal kink mode exhibits near the central region .",
    "therefore , the exterior of magnetic tower jets will be deformed into a large - scale wiggled structure by the external kink mode",
    ".    possible mechanisms of stabilizing / destabilizing in the magnetic tower jets under the gravitationally stratified atmospheres are discussed .",
    "none of the growing surface / body modes of kelvin - helmholtz instability are identified due to the small velocity shear and slow bulk speed ( compared with the local alfvn speed ) .",
    "the pressure - driven instabilities are also inhibited due to the low plasma @xmath182 ( @xmath203 ) inside the magnetic towers .",
    "the `` reversed field pinch '' field configuration in the towers and the external unmagnetized gas may provide some stabilization effects on the current - driven external modes .",
    "non - axisymmetric current - driven instabilities ( @xmath186 ) are absolute instabilities , i.e. , they grow but do not propagate in the jet co - moving ( rest ) frame @xcite .",
    "if the dissipation timescale @xmath204 of the current associated with jets is much longer than the jet dynamical timescale @xmath205 , the patterns created by the cdi modes will persist for some time as the flow advances . and",
    "the bulk flow itself will appear to travel in a true 3-d helical pattern as it follows the magnetic backbone of the helix , as observationally expected in several radio sources as 3c 345 @xcite , 3c 120 @xcite , and 3c 449 @xcite .",
