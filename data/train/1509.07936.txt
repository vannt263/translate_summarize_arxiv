    "there has been a lot of effort both experimentally and theoretically to study the quantum dynamics of ultracold atoms in optical lattices , such as the celebrated bloch oscillations ( bos )  @xcite and the landau - zener ( lz ) tunneling  @xcite .",
    "these studies have focused on the lowest band as it is hard to load atoms to high bands and then control their quantum dynamics experimentally .",
    "recently , people are pushing the boundary and studying quantum dynamics involving more than one bands .",
    "the effort has resulted in the observation of the bloch - zener oscillations ( bzos )  @xcite , where the quantum oscillations are between two bloch bands and the crossing between these two bands is facilitated by the lz tunneling .    however , this kind of oscillations within two bloch bands are very difficult to observe in a simple single - well optical lattice . in this kind of simple lattices , the band gaps are always smaller for higher bands .",
    "if atoms can tunnel from the s - band to the p - band , they should also be able to tunnel from the p - band to the d band . as a result ,",
    "the oscillations would involve uncontrollably many bands  @xcite . to control oscillations within two bands ,",
    "one has to design lattices with more complex constructions , which include binary superlattice of optical waveguide arrays  @xcite , honeycomb lattice  @xcite , and mini - band structure  @xcite . here in this work",
    "we demonstrate experimentally that we can initiate and control quantum oscillations with two high excited bands in a simple single - well optical lattice .",
    "our trick is to use the variable external force from the harmonic trap instead of the usual linear external potential .    in this work the bose - einstein condensate ( bec )",
    "is initially loaded non - adiabatically into the g - band of a one - dimensional single - well optical lattice .",
    "it subsequently tunnels to the f - band and begins oscillations within the f and d bands , which are clearly observed in the momentum space .",
    "we can control the bragg reflection between momenta @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is at the fbz edge between the f and d bands , by tuning the optical lattice strength .",
    "@xmath2 is the wave vector of the laser forming the lattice . when the bragg reflection is weak , quantum oscillations crossing the f and d bands are observed .",
    "when the reflection is strong , quantum oscillations are observed in only the f - band .",
    "when the bragg reflection is at intermediate strength , we observe the superposition of these two types of quantum oscillations . in our results",
    ", the oscillations crossing the two excited bands can last up to 58ms , which is much longer than the bzos observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . during the oscillations ,",
    "the bec can be displaced up to @xmath3 m ( 470 lattice sites ) in space , which is bigger than the spatial displacement observed in super - bloch oscillations  @xcite .",
    "in our experiment , a pure bec of about @xmath4 @xmath5rb atoms is prepared in a hybrid trap which is formed by overlapping a single - beam optical dipole trap with wave length @xmath6 nm and a quadrapole magnetic trap .",
    "the resulting harmonic trapping frequencies are @xmath7hz . after preparing a bec in the harmonic trap , we use the non - adiabatic shortcut method  @xcite to load the bec in a one - dimensional optical lattice ( along the @xmath8 direction ) into the g - band at the quasi - momentum @xmath9 . the optical lattice @xmath10 is produced by a standing wave created by two counter - propagating laser beams with the lattice constant @xmath11 nm and @xmath12 being the lattice depth .",
    "this coherent loading method  @xcite includes a series of designed standing wave pulses shown in fig .",
    "[ shortcut_method](a ) .",
    "it allows us to non - adiabatically load a bec from the ground state of the harmonic trap @xmath13 directly into a target state @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the eigenstate of bloch bands , @xmath16 is the band index .",
    "the pulse sequence can be optimized so that the final state is nearly a bloch state ( the fidelity can be over 98% ) .",
    "this can be verified with the proportion of different momentum components or the fast oscillations of different momentum states . for the f and g bands , @xmath17 momenta have dominate population while @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the s - band , as indicated by the experimental results shown in fig .",
    "[ shortcut_method](b ) . due to the symmetry of parity , two series of pulses @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 are needed if we want to load directly a bec into the f - band . for convenience ,",
    "we load atoms into the g - band with @xmath20 pulses sequence in the experiment .",
    "our loading process is finished in tens of microseconds by applying a series of pulsed optical lattices , and this rapid generation of the quantum state in higher bands is different from other preparation methods  @xcite .",
    "our method allows us to explore rich physics in high bloch bands predicted theoretically  @xcite .",
    "after the bec in the g - band is prepared , we hold the lattice and harmonic trap for a period of time @xmath22 , and then switch off all potentials to take pictures after @xmath23ms time of flight ( tof ) .",
    "three series of experimental absorption images for the optical lattice depth @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are shown , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ experiment](a , b , c ) .",
    "@xmath27 is the recoil energy with @xmath28 being the atomic mass .",
    "the time separation between neighboring images in the @xmath29 series is @xmath30ms and @xmath31ms in the other two series .",
    "these series of images demonstrate clearly three different quantum oscillations ; we will explain and analyze them later . for convenience , an extended band structure",
    "is drawn in fig .",
    "[ experiment](d ) , where the energy gaps between different bands are marked with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the bec is initially loaded in the g - band , where the atoms mostly populate equally around two momenta @xmath17 . as atoms with these two momenta are at the center of the trapping potential at the beginning , the only possible motion for them is to move either to the left or the right .",
    "consequently , they lose their momenta while gaining harmonic potential energy .",
    "this corresponds to that the bec makes a quantum tunneling from the g - band to the f - band over the tiny band gap at @xmath34 and @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ experiment](d ) .",
    "it is impossible for the bec to move up along the g - band due to the conservation of energy .",
    "when the lattice depth is very high so that the energy gap at @xmath34 and @xmath35 is large , it is possible for the bec to stay in the g - band for a long time .",
    "we have observed atoms maintaining in the g - band for @xmath36ms when @xmath37 . for the lattice strength of interest in our experiment , the bec always tunnels from the g - band to the f - band as soon as the initial loading ends .",
    "once the bec is in the f - band , it continues to lose momentum while gaining harmonic potential energy .",
    "this corresponds to that the bec traverses dynamically along the f - band from @xmath34 , @xmath35 to @xmath38 , @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ experiment](d ) .",
    "once arriving at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the atoms face different ensuing dynamics depending on the lattice strength .",
    "if the lattice strength is small and the bragg reflection at @xmath38 and @xmath39 is weak , the bec will continue its dynamics into the d - band by crossing the band gap .",
    "after evolving dynamically along the entire d - band , the bec comes to the band gap between d and p bands at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this band gap is always large for the lattice strength in our experiments . as a result , the atoms at @xmath40 ( @xmath42 )",
    "will be bragg reflected completely to @xmath41 ( @xmath43 ) while the atoms at @xmath41 will be bragg reflected completely to @xmath40 .",
    "no tunneling to p - band occurs . afterwards",
    "the bec will reverse its dynamics by moving up in momentum from @xmath41 , @xmath40 to @xmath39 , @xmath38 .",
    "it eventually arrives at @xmath35 , @xmath34 , finishing half of an oscillating cycle .",
    "these oscillations crossing the two bloch bands ( f and d bands ) are driven under a variable force from the harmonic trap .",
    "they are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ experiment](a ) for lattice depth @xmath24 and their period is @xmath44ms .",
    "note that the bec moving up along the bands around @xmath41 , @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ experiment](d ) by gaining momenta is due to the fact that most of the atoms are away from the center of the trapping potential and feel an accelerating force .",
    "this is different from the initial stage when the bec is loaded into the g - band , where most of the atoms are at the center of the trap and feel very small force for the finite size of the bec .",
    "when the optical lattice is strong and the gap at @xmath38 , @xmath39 is large , the bragg reflection can dominate the dynamics , forbidding the atoms tunnel from the f - band to the d - band . instead , the atoms at @xmath38 ( @xmath1 ) will transfer completely to @xmath39 ( @xmath0 ) via bragg reflection while the atoms at @xmath39 will also transfer completely to @xmath38 . in this way",
    ", the quantum dynamics is confined within the f - band .",
    "these oscillations only within the f - band are observed in our experiment for @xmath45 and are shown fig .",
    "[ experiment](c ) with a period of @xmath46ms .",
    "when the lattice strength is intermediate , the bragg reflection at @xmath38 , @xmath39 will be partial : one part of the atoms will be reflected and undergo oscillations within the f - band ; the other part of the atoms will tunnel to the d - band and oscillate across both the f and d bands . as a result",
    ", we should be able to observe a superposition of the two kinds of oscillations : across both the f and d bands and only within the f - band , when the lattice is at an intermediate strength .",
    "this is indeed what we observed in experiment as shown in fig .",
    "[ experiment](b ) and simulated in theory as shown in fig .",
    "[ theory](c ) and ( d ) for @xmath47 , where the two kinds of oscillations are clearly seen , and the ratio of them can be tuned by the lattice strength .     while ( c ) and ( d ) are @xmath47 .",
    "the white circles in ( a ) are the result of the semi - classical model.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we have simulated the experiment with the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) . in the simulation ,",
    "the initial state is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the ground state of the bec in a harmonic trap and @xmath50 is the bloch wave function in the g - band at @xmath51 .",
    "we have plotted our numerical results in both the real space and the momentum space in fig .",
    "[ theory ] for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the results in the momentum space agree well with the experimental results in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] .",
    "we can infer from fig .",
    "[ theory](b ) that the bec can move away from the center of the trap by up to @xmath3 m for the oscillations in both the f and d bands . for oscillations in f - band ,",
    "our numerical results indicate that this displacement can be up to @xmath54 m , which is much larger than what was observed in super - bloch oscillations in ref .",
    "there is a small discrepancy between the theoretical results and the experimental results .",
    "for example , there is a slight off - set in the experimental oscillations around 6 - 7ms for @xmath52 ; this slight off - set is not seen in the corresponding theoretical results .",
    "the explanation for this small discrepancy becomes clear when we discuss brag reflection in the next section .",
    "it is difficult to observe oscillations in the real space in experiment . to do that",
    ", we need to keep the tof very short .",
    "within such a short tof , the atomic cloud is still very dense and the tof image is not proportional to the cloud density . at the same time , the tof image is obscured by the thermal cloud that has no time to disperse .    as the bec density profile varies smoothly over hundreds of lattice sites ,",
    "its dynamics can be well described by the semi - classical dynamics of bloch particles  @xcite , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath57th energy band and @xmath58 is the force acting on the bloch particle . for bloch electrons in traditional condensed matter physics",
    ", we usually have @xmath59 . in our case , @xmath60 with the harmonic trap frequency @xmath61 .    for simplicity",
    ", we describe the energy bands with a cosine function as @xmath62 , with @xmath63 representing the f and d bands , respectively , and @xmath64 the width of the energy bands . for this simplified case",
    ", we can solve eqs.([re],[qe ] ) analytically and find that the oscillation periods are : @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is the initial quasi - momentum considering the finite size of the bec , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind as @xmath72}^2}{u^{2n } } } } \\right\\}$ ] .",
    "it is obvious that the periods for the two kinds of oscillations are inversely proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "this inverse relation does not change even when we use the realistic bloch bands instead of the idealized cosine form .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical results with the semi - classical equations ( [ re],[qe ] ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ periods ] . since @xmath73hz in our experiment",
    ", we have @xmath74ms for @xmath45 and @xmath75ms for @xmath24 , which agree very well with the experimental results in fig .",

    "bragg reflection ( or scattering ) at the bloch band edge or center is a fundamental quantum process in periodic systems .",
    "as we have already seen , it plays a crucial role in the oscillations observed in our experiments .",

    "there are two fractions of atoms at @xmath43 : one fraction waits to be reflected to @xmath42 and the other consists of atoms just scattered from @xmath42 . as atoms at @xmath18 are located in different places , these two fractions at @xmath43 are separated in coordinate space . with a 28ms tof",

    "there are also two fractions for @xmath42 . as a result ,",
    "we observe four peaks during the period between 5.8ms and 6.1ms , instead of two peaks for other times .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ bragg_reflections](a ) , the reflection between @xmath80 occurs roughly from 3.4ms to 4.0ms , which is about twice longer than the reflection between @xmath18 .",

    "[ bragg_reflections](c ) is the simulation result with the gpe for @xmath29 which is consistent with our experimental result .",
