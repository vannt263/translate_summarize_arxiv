    "in this section we will discuss the effect of a term @xmath141 on @xmath88 .",
    "such a term describes the interaction between the out - of - plane components of the boundary spins @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and corresponds to a local four - body interaction in the language of the magnetic quasiparticles .",
    "the main question is whether such interaction terms give a contribution to the imaginary part of @xmath88 at small @xmath72 , possibly even in an order that is lower than the fourth order contribution we found in the main text .",
    "we will show explicitly that this is not the case .",

    "since @xmath143 contains an equal number of creation and annihilation operators ( both on the dot and in the reservoir ) , we need to consider also the odd orders in the expansion of eq .",
    "( 6 ) in the main text in powers of @xmath119 .",
    "the first order contribution to @xmath73 due to @xmath143 is given by @xmath145 it can immediately be seen that the contribution to @xmath88 due to this term evaluates to zero .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath146 operator does not change the number of magnetic quasiparticles @xmath147 on the dot , and we defined @xmath147 such that @xmath148 . from this reasoning",
    "it follows that all contributions that contain only @xmath143-operators vanish , regardless of the order .    the first nonzero contribution to @xmath73 that contains both @xmath143 and @xmath142 operators ( and hence",
    "can not be said to be zero a priori ) is third order in @xmath119 .",

    "we do find ( real - valued ) contributions to @xmath88 at @xmath151 .",

    "the system is equivalent to the electronic quantum capacitor ( with @xmath160 and @xmath161 ) that has been studied extensively in the literature@xcite . in particular ,",
    "it has been@xcite shown and observed experimentally@xcite that the charge relaxation resistance without interactions ( _ i.e. _ with @xmath162 is universal at zero temperature , as long as the spectrum in the dot remains discrete . when interactions are turned on in the dot",
    "this result remains valid for small dots ( with a discrete spectrum ) and leads to another universality class for large dots ( with a continuous spectrum ) thanks to the coulomb gap@xcite . here",
    ", universal means that the value of the charge relaxation resistance does not depend on any microscopic parameters , such as the coupling between the dot and the reservoir .",
    "instead , it is simply a combination of fundamental constants . in the af language",
    "the charge relaxation resistance becomes @xmath163 for a small dot and @xmath164 for a large dot . in the main text",
    "we derive these results in the weak - coupling limit , but the close resemblance between the af- and electronic systems allows us to extend them to the full range of parameters@xcite .    when interactions are also present in the reservoir , hamamato _ _ et al.__@xcite have shown , using the luttinger liquid framework@xcite , that the charge relaxation resistance is re - scaled by a factor @xmath112 , where @xmath165 is the luttinger interaction parameter .",
    "@xmath111 for non - interacting particles and @xmath166 for repulsive interactions .",
    "however , this result only holds for weak - enough interactions , depending of the strength of the tunneling coupling .",

    "the critical luttinger parameter is @xmath167 .",
    "interestingly , in the magnetic language , this corresponds to the opening of a gap in the spectrum of the infinite chain as the system goes from the conducting @xmath168 phase to the mott - insulating ising phase .",
    "indeed , the bethe - ansatz solution gives@xcite    @xmath169    therefore @xmath170 corresponds to @xmath171 , which is the boundary between the two phases mentioned above .",
    "ferromagnetic systems with spin @xmath172 are handled using the so - called holstein - primakoff transformation@xcite .",
    "this transformation allows us to describe the spin excitations as magnons : magnetic quasiparticles that are bosonic in nature .",
    "the bosonic operators @xmath173 in the dot are implicitly defined as @xmath174 and similar expressions hold for the operators in the reservoir . in the large-@xmath175 limit , we can expand the square roots in powers of @xmath176 . if we take only the lowest - order terms into account , we can diagonalize the hamiltonian in terms of free magnons .",
    "this transformation has to be applied to both parts of the system independently .",
    "we found in the main text that the resistance @xmath2 of our circuit is determined by the fourth order ( in @xmath119 ) contribution to @xmath88 .",
    "however , the nonlinear terms in the expressions for @xmath177 yield contributions to @xmath88 that superficially appear similar to the fourth order contributions .",
    "specifically , they contain the same amount of bosonic creation-/annihilation operators .",
    "therefore , we have checked explicitly that the non - linearities in ( [ hp_trans ] ) , when treated perturbatively , do not affect the physics of our magnetic quantum rc circuit qualitatively . in particular",
    ", they do not cause dissipation ( imaginary part of the response function ) to second order .",
    "instead , they only renormalize the correlators .",
    "to be more precise , we found that the sole effect of substituting @xmath178d_0 $ ] ( and the accompanying substitution for @xmath179 ) in the expression for @xmath73 given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) in the main text is to renormalize the final result for @xmath3 with a factor @xmath180 .",

    "<S> this leads to six unique terms that can not be excluded a priori and differ in the number of magnetic excitations in the intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the procedure followed to determine @xmath73 by focussing on the term for which the excess number of magnetic excitations on the dot varies as @xmath91 . after performing the integrations over time as well as a transformation to momentum - space </S>",
    "<S> we find the following contribution to @xmath92 $ ] at small @xmath72 to fourth order in @xmath93 due to this term : @xmath94 where it is understood that we need to take the continuum limit on the reservoir in order for the delta - function to be well - defined . </S>",
    "<S> the other terms that make up @xmath73 can be calculated analogously , and we will refrain from repeating the required steps here .    up to this point , </S>",
    "<S> our results for @xmath73 are identical for fm and af systems . </S>",
    "<S> the sole difference between the two arises now from the fact that @xmath95 and @xmath96 are different for af and fm systems .    </S>",

    "<S> we recover the fact that the spin resistance is universal in the sense that it does not depend on any microscopic parameters of the dot ; not even on the coupling between the loop and the chain . </S>",
    "<S> as we show in the appendix , this result is related to the fact that one can map the af spin-1/2 chain to one - dimensional fermions with interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been studied extensively in the past few years in the context of electronic rc circuits@xcite even beyond perturbation theory using for instance bosonization or monte - carlo calculations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this mapping allows us to extend our results to any value of the tunneling coupling . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the effect of electron - electron interactions in the reservoir and dot on the parameters of the rc circuit have been analyzed using a luttinger liquid description@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since these interactions translate to a @xmath108-term in the spin chains , these results allow us to extend eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rcaf1])-([eq : rcaf2 ] ) to finite values of @xmath109 . a finite value of @xmath110 corresponds to a deviation of the luttinger liquid parameter from the noninteracting value @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> this simply leads to an additional factor @xmath112 in the result for @xmath2 , so the resistance remains universal . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the capacitance @xmath3 is changed in a nontrivial manner@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ fm case_. the zero temperature limit is pathological for fm systems , since the bose - einstein distribution diverges at @xmath60 . </S>",

    "<S> the fact that the relaxation resistance is negative is not a fundamental issue but only means that the dynamical response of the spin capacitor is out of phase with the perturbation .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the universality of the relaxation resistance in electronic interacting systems was shown in ref . to be intimately related to the korringa - shiba relation@xcite ( see also garst et al.@xcite for an extended version of this relation ) which relates the imaginary part of the charge susceptibility to the square of its real part . </S>",
    "<S> such a relation applies at or near a fermi - liquid fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore not surprising to find a non - universal behavior for @xmath2 in the fm case , where low - energy excitations are bosonic . </S>",
    "<S> + we turn now to the possibility of using the setup displayed in fig . 1 as a source of magnetic quasiparticles . </S>",

    "<S> et al . _ have shown  @xcite experimentally that the electronic quantum rc circuit can be used as an on - demand single - electron source , by applying a square voltage pulse @xmath120 with a large amplitude to the dot , such that the system is taken beyond the linear response regime . </S>",
    "<S> the jordan - wigner transformation shows that the af system is equivalent to the electronic system , and hence we propose that the af system can be used as an on - demand single - spinon source , with the simple substitution @xmath121 . for fm systems , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is fundamentally different ; due to the fact that the ( bosonic ) thermal distribution of magnons allows for more than one magnon per momentum state , it is not possible to create a single - magnon source using the same mechanism </S>",
    "<S> . however , an on - demand few - magnon source appears feasible .    finally , we comment on the possibility of measuring the properties of the magnetic quantum rc circuit experimentally . the ultimate implementation uses parallel spin chains , such as depicted in fig . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , molecular magnets@xcite could be a good candidate to take the role of magnetic dot due to their beneficial properties , such as their increased size , chemical engineerability , and the possibility to control the spin state using electric- instead of magnetic fields@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , based on the magnitude of the spin currents and the involved time scales , the implementation of the magnetic rc circuit in the above systems appears challenging . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we propose an alternative system to test our predictions , namely ultracold atoms in optical lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown@xcite that ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices can be used to implement effective spin-1/2 heisenberg chains ( both af and fm ) with tunable anisotropy @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is now possible@xcite to measure the spin state in such systems dynamically , locally , and with single - spin precision .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the ( effective ) magnetic field @xmath123 has the form @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> validity of our results then requires @xmath125 . from eq . </S>",

    "<S> if we assume @xmath135 ( see the discussion below eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rcaf2 ] ) for the validity of this approximation ) and @xmath136 , it follows that a collection of @xmath137 parallel chains suffices to determine @xmath129 in repeated measurements . for the smallest magnetic dots , @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> a representative value@xcite for @xmath17 is @xmath139 khz , which leads to @xmath140 hz , smaller than the typical lifetime of excitations in such systems@xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion_. in conclusion , we have studied a model of a magnetic rc circuit and computed the effective capacitance and resistance from microscopic parameters . </S>",
