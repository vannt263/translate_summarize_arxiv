    "before the mid-1990s it was believed that young neutron stars are all fast - spinning objects with high surface magnetic field strengths of @xmath4 g , emitting radio pulses .",
    "however , recent discoveries of new populations of neutron stars , including central compact objects ( ccos ) , magnetars , and x - ray dim isolated neutron stars , have challenged this simple picture ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ccos are the most enigmatic class .",
    "they are found at the center of supernova remnants ( snrs ) and can not be as easily classified as other types of objects .",
    "there are nine confirmed ccos sharing the following properties : ( 1 ) they are located near the centers of young snrs ; ( 2 ) they show no radio or optical counterparts ; ( 3 ) they have no detectable pulsar wind nebulae ; and ( 4 ) they exhibit a thermal spectrum in the soft x - ray band with high luminosity @xmath5ergs@xmath2  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "since ccos are generally associated with very young snrs , their nature and evolution are highly relevant to the neutron star production rate and the physics underlying the branching ratios of core collapse @xcite . however , the active lifetime and evolution of ccos are poorly understood due to the small sample .",
    "it is also unclear if these neutron stars are intrinsically radio - quiet , or if they are radio pulsars beamed away from us ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "only three ccos have x - ray pulsations firmly detected .",
    "they show periods of @xmath60.4s and long - term timing revealed small period derivatives of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "their spin parameters are plotted in the  diagram in figure  [ fig : ppdot ] .",
    "these suggest spin - down luminosities of @xmath8@xmath9ergs@xmath2 , where @xmath10 is the neutron star moment of inertia .",
    "these values are nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the cco s x - ray luminosities , implying that the sources can not be entirely powered by rotation .",
    "the characteristic age @xmath11 of the three ccos is over @xmath12years , much older than their true ages of a few thousand years , estimated from their associated snrs .",
    "the inferred surface dipole field strengths @xmath13 g are of the order of @xmath14 g .",
    "these are much lower than those of young pulsars but still lie well above the radio pulsar `` death line '' ( e.g. , @xmath15gs@xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is the ( uncertain ) theoretical limit for producing radio emission .",
    "indeed , radio pulsars have been detected in the cco range of @xmath17 and  ( see figure  [ fig : ppdot ] ) , hence with comparable dipole field strengths .",
    "this raises a fundamental question : are ccos and radio pulsars the same class of objects or do they belong to disjointed sets of neutron stars ?",
    "if ccos are ordinary radio pulsars born with weak magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their small @xmath18 values imply very slow spin evolution , such that they take a long time to reach the death line .",
    "the detection of nine young ccos implies that there should be over @xmath19 older ones in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the small number of known radio pulsars with low @xmath20 g as shown in the  diagram in figure  [ fig : ppdot ] , given that there is no observational bias against these pulsars in radio surveys ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the discrepancy could be reconciled if ccos are strong - field objects but appear to have weak surface fields at a young age .",
    "this is supported by modeling of ccos x - ray light curves , which suggest a strong crustal field @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that the @xmath21-fields of ccos could be buried by supernova fallback @xcite , and hence the radio emission is suppressed ( as in the case of accreting millisecond pulsars in quiescence ; see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after accretion stops , the @xmath21-field is expected to diffuse back to the surface with a timescale depending sensitively on the amount of accreted mass and ranging from @xmath22years to over @xmath19years ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radio emission would then presumably switch on @xcite .",
    "this picture predicts that young ccos should be radio - quiet and aged ones could become ordinary radio pulsars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "no radio emission has yet been observed from any cco ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , but given the small number of known pulsating ccos and the possibility of small beaming fractions , the result is inconclusive and a more systematic study is needed .",
    "in addition to deeper radio observations , we can turn the search around to look for cco - like x - ray emission from selected weak - field radio pulsars . indeed ,",
    "if ccos manifest as radio pulsars , this could be a more efficient way to detect them , especially after their natal snrs fade away in @xmath23years .",
    "any detection of x - ray emission from the radio - selected sample will confirm ccos as a subset of radio pulsars , providing direct evidence to rule out the scenario of ongoing accretion .",
    "there were previous attempts to identify ccos from radio pulsars positionally coincident with snrs @xcite and aged ccos with parent snrs that have dissipated ( so - called orphaned ccos ) from disrupted recycled pulsars @xcite .",
    "however , no new ccos have been found . to complete the study , here",
    "we present an x - ray census of all isolated weak - field radio pulsars near the galactic plane to search for cco - like emission .",
    "the sample selection and data analysis are described in section  [ sect : data ] and we report the detection limits and discuss the implications in section  [ sect : discuss ] .",
    "we select weak - field radio pulsars from the atnf catalog @xcite with similar spin parameters as those of the known ccos , according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "weak surface dipole @xmath21-fields of @xmath24 g inferred from spin - down ; 2 .   isolated and having periods",
    "@xmath25s to avoid recycled pulsars ; and 3 .   located @xmath26pc from the galactic plane to exclude old objects .",
    "the pulsar height from the plane is calculated from the source s galactic latitude and estimated distance .",
    "neutron stars are born at an average distance of 50pc from the plane with a mean space velocity of @xmath27kms@xmath2@xcite . at this velocity",
    ", a pulsar travels only 36pc in @xmath28years , which is well below the cut even in the rare case that a pulsar moves exactly perpendicular to the plane .",

    "as mentioned , the characteristic age is not a good indicator of the true age of a pulsar .",
    "we therefore attempt to constrain the age by comparing the luminosity limits above with standard neutron star cooling curves .",
    "we employed a cooling code based on @xcite with some modifications as described in @xcite .",
    "the temperature evolution of an isolated neutron star is determined by the relativistic equations of energy balance and heat flux ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "two important factors affecting the evolution are the composition of the outer layer ( i.e. , the envelope ) and whether the stellar interior is superfluid and/or superconducting . for the former , the envelope serves as a heat blanket @xcite . if it is composed of light elements , which have higher thermal conductivity , it would be more heat transparent @xcite . however , the exact composition of the envelope is uncertain .",

    "on the other hand , emission due to the cooper pairing of nucleons would be enhanced when the temperature decreases just below the critical value ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "here we consider a @xmath62 and 11.6 km radius ( corresponding to an observed radius @xmath56 km ) star built with the akmal - pandharipande - ravenhall ( apr ) equation of state ( eos ) @xcite and the standard ( also known as minimal ) cooling scenario , in which neutrino emission by fast direct urca processes does not take place ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we show in figure  [ fig : cooling ] two shaded regions , one for a maximally thick @xmath63 hydrogen envelope and one for an iron envelope .",
    "the upper boundary of each region is determined by a cooling model with only superconducting protons ( gap model ccdk ) and the lower boundary accounts for superfluid neutrons as well ( singlet gap model sfb and triplet gap model ttoa ) , which induce more rapid cooling ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . to illustrate the effect of different masses , we plot in the figure inset cooling curves of @xmath64 and @xmath62 stars for models with only superconducting protons .",
    "the model cooling curves are compared with the candidates luminosity limits in figure  [ fig : cooling ] to constrain the source age .",
    "the result slightly depends on the neutron star mass in the model , but the main uncertainty comes from the whether or not neutrons in the core become superfluid .",
    "the inferred age lower limits are listed in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the results are not very constraining . for nearby objects that have good luminosity limits",
    ", we deduce age limits of @xmath65years , but no useful limits are obtained for the rest , and deeper x - ray observations are needed for further investigation . unlike the cco candidates in our previous study @xcite , none of the sources here coincide with known snrs , and we do not find evidence of remnant emission from the x - ray data .",
    "this indeed gives a hint that the sources are likely older than @xmath23years , such that the snrs have already dissipated in the interstellar environment .",
    "the non - detection of x - ray emission from our sample of weak - field radio pulsars seems to support the idea that the two are not evolutionary connected classes of neutron stars , similar to what previous studies have suggested ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it was proposed that the magnetic fields of ccos could be buried by accretion from supernova materials at birth @xcite , resulting in the suppression of radio emission .",
    "as the field diffuses back to the surface , the radio emission would subsequently turn on so that a cco becomes a radio pulsar . to investigate the effect of magnetic field diffusion on the neutron star spin evolution",
    ", we applied a model described in @xcite to solve the induction equation .",
    "we assumed that the @xmath21-field is confined in the crust and is initially buried at a high density of @xmath66g@xmath67 , which corresponds to a depth of @xmath68 m or an accreted mass of @xmath69 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we consider different initial surface @xmath21-field strengths from @xmath70 g to @xmath71 g and the resulting spin evolution is overplotted in the  diagram in figure  [ fig : ppdot ] .",
    "we found that even at this large burial depth , the field emerges with a relatively short timescale of a few @xmath72years , resulting in a vertically upward track in the diagram .",
    "more importantly , a cco with an emerging surface field is expected to pass through the  parameter space of our candidates ( i.e. , @xmath73@xmath74 g ) at a young age of the order of @xmath75yr , such that it should remain hot and luminous , with the parent snr probably still visible .",
    "if this model is true , our candidates are likely to just be old ordinary pulsars rather than orphaned ccos .",
    "moreover , we expect that when an aged cco turns on as a radio pulsar , it will have a stronger @xmath21-field than those of our candidates .    for further study ,",
    "identifying cco descendants would require x - ray observations of more radio pulsars to search for thermal emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , it would be useful to extend the survey to include sources with @xmath76 g . on the other hand",
    ", it is more difficult to detect an orphan cco if the radio emission never turns on ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this is best done with all - sky surveys in x - rays , such as the upcoming _ erosita _ mission @xcite . finally , pulsar braking index measurements from long - term timing could reveal a growing dipole field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could indicate @xmath21-field diffusion to the surface ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we present an x - ray study of all isolated radio pulsars within 100pc of the galactic plane , which has spin - down - inferred @xmath21-fields weaker than @xmath74 g , with the aim of searching for cco - like thermal x - ray emission .",
    "none of our 12 candidates were detected in the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations and we obtained bolometric luminosity limits of @xmath9@xmath77ergs@xmath2 .",
    "the limits were compared with a standard neutron star cooling model to constrain the source ages .",
    "together with the lack of known associated snrs , we conclude that all candidates are unlikely to be young ccos .",
    "this result supports the idea that young ccos and currently known weak - field radio pulsars are not connected through evolution .",
    "this could be a consequence of field burial by supernova materials .",
    "we model the pulsar spin evolution in this scenario and show that the surface @xmath21-field could reemerge rapidly with a timescale shorter than 100kyr .",
    "it could therefore be fruitful to include radio pulsars with slightly stronger fields ( @xmath78 g ) in future searches for cco descendants .",
