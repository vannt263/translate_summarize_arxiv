    "the search for new particles , predicted in supersymmetric models , is one of the most important tasks of the experiments at the lhc .",
    "the detailed determination of particle masses and couplings will be crucial for the discrimination between various manifestations of supersymmetry ( susy ) and alternative models , even more so if one wants to distinguish between the different variants of supersymmetric models , to identify the origin of breaking of supersymmetry and to measure the model parameters .",
    "one of the susy signals will be events with missing energy or missing transverse momentum , resulting from cascade decays of squarks and gluinos into the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which escapes detection .",
    "the existence of squarks , gluinos and the lsp is definitely a key prediction of supersymmetry .",
    "depending on details of the models , in particular the mass of the lsp , gluinos and squarks with masses up to 3 tev @xcite could be detected .",
    "the decay rates of gluinos and squarks depend strongly on the ratio of squark and gluino masses .",
    "if the gluino is heavier ( @xmath9 ) , the two - body decay of the gluino into a squark and an antiquark ( or its charge conjugate ) is possible with the squark decaying into a quark plus a chargino or neutralino . in the opposite case ( @xmath10 )",
    "the two - body decay of the gluino is kinematically forbidden and the now dominant three - body decay into quark , antiquark and neutralino or chargino , mediated by the virtual squark , leads to a small decay rate for the gluino while the squark decays into the gluino plus a quark .",
    "the importance of squark and gluino searches has motivated a series of detailed studies of hadroproduction cross sections for squarks and gluinos .",
    "the lowest order has been evaluated long time ago @xcite .",
    "subsequently nlo susy - qcd corrections were calculated @xcite , more recently the effect of soft - gluon resummation @xcite was included .",
    "the present paper will be concerned with gluino - squark - pair production close to threshold , which exhibits a number of peculiar features .",
    "the sum of gluino and squark single decay width is expected to be much larger than the annihilation decay width of the squark - gluino system . in this case the bound state decay proceeds through the decay of the constituents and for decay rates of several gev no well defined bound states exist .",
    "nevertheless , final state interaction will lead to a significant lowering of the effective production threshold , to an enhancement of the cross section and a strong distortion of the differential cross section , in particular of the distribution in the invariant mass of the gluino - squark pair , with details depending on the masses and single decay widths of gluinos and squarks .",
    "this scenario has many similarities with hadronic top quark- @xcite and gluino - pair production @xcite ( with @xmath11 close to @xmath12 ) close to threshold .",
    "( it differs , however , from gluino pair production in the case of large squark masses , where annihilation decays of @xmath13 bound states into two gluon jets could still dominate above constituent decays @xcite . ) in particular the distribution in the invariant mass of the gluino - squark pair can be calculated with similar methods .",
    "a gluino - squark pair can be combined into bound states transforming under three irreducible representations , two of them attractive and one repulsive . as in refs .",
    "@xcite the nlo result for the hard corrections is approximated by including the logarithmically enhanced terms from initial- and final - state radiation .",
    "the green s function is evaluated in nlo approximation .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows : for a self - contained treatment we recall in section[sec : quantum ] the quantum numbers of the bound states , discuss various susy scenarios and present the qualitative features of threshold production for the case of interest , i.e. for gluino - squark bound states with decay rates comparable to the level spacing of the would - be bound states .    in section[subsec :",
    "green ] we will present the threshold enhancement ( or suppression ) for the various colour configurations using green s functions in nlo approximation . these will be evaluated similar to those of the @xmath14 system discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite or the @xmath15 system studied in @xcite .",
    "( for earlier investigations of squark and gluino bound state production at hadron colliders see @xcite . )",
    "the important difference is the non - degeneracy of the constituent masses , namely the gluino and squark mass . in section[subsec : short ] the effect of initial- and final - state radiation is investigated .",
    "only @xmath0 waves will be considered .",
    "the choice of the proper value of the strong coupling @xmath16 is discussed .    using this input ,",
    "the hadronic production cross section can be evaluated in a straightforward way in section[sec : num ] .",
    "we limit the discussion to proton - proton collisions at @xmath17 and @xmath18 tev and give results for several of the susy scenarios discussed in section[sec : quantum ] and compare the results to those obtained without final - state corrections .",
    "section[sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "let us briefly recall the quantum numbers of gluino - squark pairs in the threshold region , classified according to their colour configurations @xcite . while the combination of a spin @xmath19 and a spin @xmath20 particle is trivial , a colour - octet and a colour - triplet state can be combined into irreducible representations as follows ( see also appendix  [ app:3times8 ] . ) : @xmath21 while the same equation with a conjugate triplet on the left - hand side ( representing an antisquark ) results in @xmath22 the interaction can be either attractive or repulsive . in lowest order the coefficient of the qcd potential which governs the final state interaction",
    "is given by the expectation value of the product of the colour generators of the fundamental and the adjoint representation @xmath23 .",
    "this product , in turn , can be expressed by the eigenvalues of the quadratic casimir operator of the constituents , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and of the boundstate in representation @xmath26 , @xmath27 : @xmath28=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_r - c_f - c_a\\right )    \\ , .",
