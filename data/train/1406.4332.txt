    "it is a fundamental problem to understand properties of baryonic many - body systems such as nuclei , hypernuclei and neutron stars on the basis of underlying baryon - baryon ( bb ) interactions .",
    "the basic property of nuclear systems composed of nucleons is the saturation property of density and energy per particle . though important roles for this property are played by repulsive cores and tensor components included in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) interactions , it is insufficient quantitatively : we need to take into account the three - nucleon interaction composed of the attractive part ( tna ) and the repulsive part ( tnr ) .",
    "while the tna contributes moderately as function of density , the tnr contribution increases rapidly in the high - density region and leads to high values of the nuclear incompressibility .",
    "it is well known that the latter is indispensable for the stiff equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - star matter needed to reproduce large maximum masses of neutron stars .",
    "the neutron stars j1614 - 2230  @xcite and j0348 - 0432  @xcite have brought great impacts on the maximum - mass problem , observed masses of which are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "these large masses give a severe condition for the stiffness of eos of neutron - star matter , suggesting the existence of strong tnr .    on the other hand , the hyperon ( @xmath6 ) mixing in neutron - star matter is known to bring about the remarkable softening of the eos , which cancels the tnr effect for the maximum mass  @xcite .",
    "one of ideas to avoid this serious problem is to consider that the tnr - like repulsions work universally for @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath9 as well as for @xmath10 @xcite . in this work",
    "we adopt this idea : universal repulsions among three baryons are called here as the three - baryon repulsion ( tbr ) .",
    "the main subject in this paper is to investigate whether or not the maximum mass of @xmath2 can be obtained from the eos for hyperon - mixed neutron - star matter , when tbr is taken into account .    in order to treat hyperon - mixed nuclear matter realistically ,",
    "it is indispensable to use a reliable interaction model for baryon - baryon ( @xmath11 ) channels including not only @xmath12 but also @xmath13 and @xmath14 : we adopt here the extended soft core ( esc ) model developed by two of authors ( t.r . and y.y . ) and m.m .",
    "nagels  @xcite . in this model",
    "two - meson and meson - pair exchanges are taken into account explicitly and no effective boson is included differently from the usual one - boson exchange models .",
    "the latest version of esc model is named as esc08c  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , esc means this version .",
    "the tbr is taken into account by the multi - pomeron exchange potential ( mpp ) within the esc modeling .",
    "some many - body theory is needed to treat many - body systems with a realistic @xmath11 interaction model : the g - matrix theory is a good tool for such a purpose , where the correlations induced by short - range and tensor components are renormalized into g - matrix interactions .",
    "similarly baryonic coupling terms such as @xmath15-@xmath16 ones are included this way into single - channel g - matrices such as @xmath15-@xmath15 ones . in the case of nucleon matter",
    ", the lowest - order g - matrix calculations with the continuous ( con ) choice for intermediate single particle potentials were shown to simulate well the results including higher hole - line contributions up to about 4 times of normal density @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "on the basis of this recognition , we study properties of baryonic matter including not only nucleons but also hyperons with use of the lowest - order g - matrix theory with the con choice .",
    "the methodology in our works is to use the @xmath11 interaction model determined on the basis of terrestrial experiments , namely to introduce no ad hoc parameter to stiffen the eos .",
    "the most important is how to determine the strength of the tnr being an essential quantity for the stiffness of eos .",
    "many attempts have been made to extract some information on the incompressibility @xmath18 of high - density matter formed in high - energy central heavy - ion collisions . in many cases ,",
    "however , the results for the eos still remain inconclusive . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown clearly in ref.@xcite that the tnr effect appeared in angular distributions of @xmath19o+@xmath19o elastic scattering ( @xmath20=70 mev ) , @xmath21 .",
    "such a scattering phenomenon can be analyzed quite successfully with the complex g - matrix folding potentials derived from free - space @xmath12 interactions .",
    "then , the g - matrix folding potentials including mpp contributions are used to analyze the @xmath19o+@xmath19o scattering , and the strengths of mpp are adjusted so as to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "the determined mpp interactions are included in constructing the eos of neutron - star matter , being expected to result in a stiff eos enough to give the observed neutron - star mass  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our mpp is defined so as to work universally not only in @xmath10 states but also @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath22 states .",
    "corresponding to the determined mpp , the tna is added phenomenologically to reproduce the nuclear saturation property precisely .",
    "thus , our @xmath11 interaction is composed of esc , mpp and tna .",
    "esc gives potentials in @xmath23 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) channels .",
    "mpp is universal in these channels .",
    "because tna is given in @xmath12 channels phenomenologically , there is no theoretical correspondence in @xmath28 channels .",
    "however , we can confirm the validity of esc+mpp+tna model in these channels by applying this interaction to hypernuclear calculations , and then tna is considered as a three - baryon attraction ( tba ) .    the final step in this work is to study properties of neutron stars with hyperon mixing on the basis of our @xmath11 interaction model .",
    "the eos of @xmath29-stable neutron - star matter composed of neutrons ( @xmath30 ) , protons ( @xmath31 ) , electrons ( @xmath32 ) , muons ( @xmath33 ) and hyperons ( @xmath1 and @xmath34 ) is derived from the g - matrix calculation with use of the esc+mpp+tba model . using the eos of hyperonic neuron - star matter",
    ", we solve the tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation for the hydrostatic structure , and obtain mass - radius relations of neutron stars .",
    "for a massive neutron star including hyprons , there are the works based on the relativistic mean field models @xcite . in comparison with these works ,",
    "the feature of our approach is to start from the well - established @xmath11 interaction model , and to use no adjustable parameter except those in the additional many - body interactions determined in terrestrial experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect.ii , @xmath11 interaction models are introduced .",
    "it is explained how to determine mpp and tba parts . in sect.iii",

    ", we derive the eos of hyperonic nuclear matter . by solving the tov equation ,",
    "the mass - radius relations are obtained .",
    "the conclusion of this paper is given in sect.v .",
    "in nijmegen esc - potentials , all available @xmath12- , @xmath13- , and @xmath14-data are fitted simultaneously with single sets of meson parameters . in the most recently developed esc - model ( esc08c ) the dynamics",
    "consists of the following ingredients :    1 .",
    "obe potentials from pseudo - scalar ( @xmath35 ) , vector ( @xmath36 ) , scalar ( @xmath37 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath38 ) are treated with the most general vertices .",
    "besides these , also included are the axial - vector mesons with @xmath39 .",
    "two - meson - exchange ( tme ) potentials in esc are restricted to two - pseudoscalar - exchange ( ps - ps ) potentials , where the full pseudoscalar nonets are exchanged .",
    "2 .   meson - pair exchange ( mpe ) .",
    "the two - meson - baryon - baryon vertices are the low energy approximations of ( a ) the heavy - meson and their two - meson decays , and ( b ) contributions from baryon - resonance @xmath40 etc . and negative - energy states .",
    "the mpe - interactions have been extended to all @xmath41 bb - channels by using su@xmath42(3)-symmetry .",
    "for example the tomozawa - weinberg pair - interaction potential is included in esc .",
    "diffractive contributions to the soft - core potential .",
    "the pomeron is thought of being related to an even number of gluon - exchanges .",
    "next to the pomeron - exchange ( even number of gluons ) also odderon - exchange ( odd number of gluons ) is included in the obe - part of the interactions .",
    "also , room is made for quark - core effects supplying extra repulsion , which may be required in some @xmath43-channels such as @xmath44- and @xmath45-channels .",
    "we describe this structural effect phenomenologically by gaussian repulsions , similar to the pomeron . in esc",
    "the strength of this repulsion is taken proportional to the weights of the su(6)-forbidden @xmath46$]-configuration in the various @xmath11-channels .    as a model of universal tbr",
    ", we introduce the multi - pomeron exchange potential ( mpp ) @xcite , consistently with the esc modeling , assuming that the dominant mechanism is triple and quartic pomeron exchange .",
    "the three- and four - body local potentials are derived from the triple- and quartic - pomeron vertexes .",
    "the density(@xmath47)-dependent two - body potentials in a baryonic medium are obtained by integrating over coordinates of third ( and fourth ) particles in the three - body ( and four - body ) potentials as follows : @xmath48 here , the values of the two - body pomeron strength @xmath49 and the pomeron mass @xmath50 are the same as those in esc .",
    "a scale mass @xmath51 is taken as a proton mass .      in the same way as @xcite ,",
    "the analyses for the @xmath19o@xmath52o elastic scattering at an incident energy per nucleon @xmath53 mev are performed so that the mpp strengths @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determined to reproduce the experimental data with the use of the g - matrix folding potential derived from esc including mpp .    because the nuclear saturation property can not be reproduced only by adding mpp to esc , we introduce also an attractive part phenomenologically as a density - dependent two - body interaction @xmath56 @xmath57 being a space - exchange operator . here , because the functional form is not determined within our analysis , it is fixed to be similar to the tna part given in @xcite .",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 are treated as adjustable parameters .",
    "@xmath60 works only in even states due to a @xmath61 factor .",
    "this assumption is needed to reproduce the @xmath19o@xmath52o potential at @xmath62 mev and nuclear - matter energy consistently @xcite .",
    "on the basis of g - matrix calculations , strengths of the mpp part ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) and the attractive part ( @xmath63 and @xmath59 ) are determined so as to reproduce the @xmath19o@xmath52o angular distribution at @xmath53 mev , and to reproduce the saturation properties of nucleon matter .",

    "the repulsions among neutrons make single particle potentials shallower , which allows more easily conversions of neutrons into hyperons .",
