    "type  ii - p supernovae ( sniip ) result from the core - collapse of supergiant stars with significant hydrogen envelopes .",
    "stars exceeding about eight times the mass of the sun evolve to produce an iron core which can not be supported against gravity and the resulting collapse drives a shock wave that disrupts the star .",
    "details of how the gravitational energy is converted to an explosion driven by an outward propagating shock is not completely understood , and may require core accretion instabilities @xcite or additional energy deposition by neutrinos @xcite .",
    "however , there is clear observational evidence from archival studies of nearby sniip that their progenitors are supergiant stars with radii several hundred times that of the sun ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "when the shock generated by the core - collapse reaches the surface of the star , a bright flash of hard radiation is expected @xcite .",
    "the time - scale for shock breakout is roughly the time it takes light to traverse the stellar radius @xcite . for typical supergiants",
    "this timescale is less than an hour , meaning shock breakouts are very difficult to observe directly .",
    "strong indirect evidence for a hard radiation from a breakout in a sniip comes from the ionized circumstellar rings around sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "fortuitously , shock breakouts in two sniip have recently been directly detected using the ultraviolet capabilities of the galex satellite @xcite . both of these uv observed shock breakouts lasted significantly longer than an hour implying either the supergiant has an extremely large radius or the presence of circumstellar material prolonged the uv emission @xcite .",
    "after shock breakout the bulk of the exploded star expands and the effective temperature drops .",
    "the competition between the increasing size of the photosphere and the falling temperature determines the early light curve on the time - scale of a few days . for simple assumptions of a fixed density profile and constant opacity dominated by electron scattering ,",
    "the photospheric radius and temperature can be parameterized by the progenitor mass , radius and explosion energy @xcite .",
    "approaching maximum light these simple assumptions break down , and detailed modeling is required to account for opacity variations with depth and wavelength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "so observations of the early light curve are important in constraining progenitor properties while relying on a minimum of assumptions .",
    "a recent study of the rise time of sniip has suggested that their progenitors are typically smaller than supergiants cataloged in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "some of this discrepancy could be due to selection bias in the catalogs since larger stars at a given temperature are easier to detect than their smaller cousins .",
    "still , it may be that progenitors of sniip are more compact than thought , or circumstellar interaction makes the rise time appear shorter than expected .    here",
    ", we present kepler space telescope observations of two sniip candidates .",
    "the light curves begin before explosion and were obtained with unprecedented 30-minute cadence and good photometric precision . while these kepler observations have several advantages over other studies of sniip , the red - sensitive kepler bandpass is not ideal for detecting shock breakout radiation .",
    "further , the way kepler data was taken made it difficult to study transient events in `` real time '' , so little is known about these supernovae other than their exquisite light curves which are analyzed in their entirety by @xcite .",
    "while the primary goal of the kepler mission @xcite was to find and study extra - solar planets , it also provided nearly continuous observations of many galaxies .",
    "several kepler guest observer projects monitored about 500 galaxies at 30-min cadence to look for brightness variations in their centers indicative of an active galactic nucleus or to specifically search for supernovae .",
    "targets were selected from the 2mass extended source catalog ( nasa / ipac irsa ) and the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "typically , galaxies were monitored for two to three years leading to the discovery of three type  ia supernovae @xcite , one probable type  iin event @xcite , and the supernovae presented here .",
    "unfortunately the timescale for release of kepler data meant that follow - up of the events was not possible from ground - based observatories .",
    "we did obtain spectra of the host galaxies which provide redshifts of the supernovae and information on the environment around the progenitors @xcite .    on a timescale of minutes to hours",
    ", kepler provides photometric precision of a few parts in a million for bright sources .",
    "however , on longer timescales , various systematic effects considerably reduce the precision of the standard kepler products .",
    "for example , the kepler observations were organized in three - month segments labeled quarters q0 to q16 .",
    "each quarter the spacecraft rotated to keep the sun on the solar panels resulting in the targets shifting to different detectors .",
    "about once per month , the spacecraft goes through a pointing maneuver to downlink the data to earth .",
    "significant sensitivity variations in the pipeline light curves after re - pointing maneuvers are removed through special processing",
    ". details of our kepler reduction procedures can be found in @xcite .",
    "ksn  2011a  was discovered in the galaxy kic8480662 which is a bright 2mass galaxy at a redshift of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the kepler light curve shows a fast rise , a broad maximum followed by a long plateau ( see fig .",
    "[ full ] ) .",
    "finally there is a rapid decay followed by an exponential decline .",
    "the light curve is characteristic of sniip .",
    "ksn  2011d  was discovered in the galaxy kic10649106 which is also a 2mass cataloged galaxy at a redshift of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "its light curve also shows a fast rise , a broad maximum and then a slow decay before falling off the `` plateau '' after 130 days .",
    "ksn2011d appears to fade faster on the plateau than ksn2011a , but part of that can be attributed to the higher redshift which means the bandpass contains bluer light that fades more quickly in sniip .",
    "a detailed analysis of the full light curves can be found in @xcite .",
    "these kepler supernovae light curves are very similar to several well - observed sniip events such as sn1999em ( suntzeff , private com . ) , sn1999gi @xcite and sn2012aw @xcite .",
    "the kepler supernovae are at significantly higher redshifts than these local events , so k - corrections are important , but there is no color information for the kepler events",
    ". therefore , we use the @xmath8 magnitudes of the nearby supernovae to correct them to the kepler observed frame .",
    "for the nearby supernovae we create a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for each epoch observed in multiple filters .",
    "missing filters are interpolated from adjacent epochs .",
    "the seds are corrected for milky way extinction using @xcite .",
    "the sed is corrected to the redshift of the kepler events , convolved with the kepler bandpass and the result is integrated to give the total photon flux .",
    "the result is also reddened to match the milky way extinction in the direction of the kepler supernova .",
    "kepler magnitudes are in the ab system , so the kepler bandpass is convolved with a spectrum with constant @xmath9  jy and integrated to determine the magnitude zeropoint .",
    "for comparison , figure  [ full ] displays the light curve of the well - observed local event sn  1999gi after correction to the redshifts of the kepler supernovae .",
    "sn  1999gi was a slightly fainter than typical sniip @xcite , and ignoring unknown host extinction , it is over a magnitude fainter than these two kepler supernovae .",
    "still , the shape of the light curve and length on the plateau make the sniip classification of ksn2011a and ksn2011d very solid .",
    "the rapid cadence of the kepler observations provide a unique window on the early rise of supernovae .",
    "in particular , sniip have rise times on the order of a week and are difficult to capture in typical ground - based surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in figure",
    "[ rise ] , we show the kepler light curves beginning several days before explosion and ending soon after maximum light",
    ". there are approximately 500 individual photometric measurements between the initial brightening and maximum light .",
    "but these events are at significant distance , so we have combined the kepler cadence into 6-hour median bins to improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the light curves .",
    "to fit the pre - maximum rise of the kepler events , we calculated a grid of light curves using the @xcite red supergiant ( rsg ) model .",
    "the rsg model assumes a power - law density structure with an index @xmath10 .",
    "we vary the progenitor radius and explosion energy keeping the stellar mass at 15  m@xmath2 which is typical for core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "we assume fully ionized hydrogen envelopes ( @xmath11 @xmath12  g@xmath5 ) and the set the normalization of the ejecta density to @xmath13 , although the results are not sensitive to this parameter .",
    "the @xcite model allows us to calculate the temperature and radius of the expanding photosphere as a function of time . for each epoch",
    "we construct a blackbody corrected to the redshift and distance of the kepler supernova and multiply the spectrum by the kepler sensitivity function .",
    "we then integrate and normalize the resulting flux using the zeropoint calculated in the ab magnitude system .",
    "for each pair of initial radius and explosion energy we have a light curve from which we derive a rise time and peak magnitude .",
    "the observed rise time ( and uncertainty ) defines a band in the radius versus energy plane that is nearly horizontal while the observed magnitude ( and error ) defines a band that cuts diagonally across the parameters of interest .",
    "the results for the two kepler supernovae are presented in fig .",
    "[ models ] .",
    "the intersection of the two bands is a consistent fit to the rise time and peak brightness ( corrected for milky way extinction ) and tightly constrains the derived quantities of progenitor radius and explosion energy .",
    "we also created model grids for progenitor masses of 10 and 20 m@xmath2 , but the resulting parameters did not differ significantly from the 15  m@xmath2 calculations .    the model light curves that best match the observed rise time and peak magnitude are then fit to the actual light curves by minimizing the residuals between the model and data . from this a new time of explosion",
    "is estimated and an improved rise time is calculated .",
    "this iterative method converges quickly and the resulting fits are shown in fig .",
    ".    for ksn2011d , the @xcite model with a progenitor radius of 490  r@xmath2 and explosion energy of 2@xmath14  b erg ] not only matches the rise time and peak magnitude , but the @xcite model predicts the overall shape of the rise very well .",
    "the @xmath15 parameter of the best fit model is 1532 for 1142 free parameters or a reduced @xmath16 .",
    "the best fit rise time for ksn2011a is 280@xmath1  r@xmath2 and the explosion energy is also 2@xmath14  b. @xcite found that only a few nearby sniip events had energies larger than 1.5  b , so finding two kepler supernovae with explosion energies of 2  b is surprising .",
    "but the kepler supernova search is likely biased toward discovering luminous events near the limiting magnitude of the survey and these will tend to have higher explosion energies than supernovae found in volume limited searches of nearby events .",
    "no correction has been made for possible host extinction because colors are not measured for these events .",
    "the explosion energy will be the parameter most affected by our uncertainty in host reddening and in our analysis we are actually estimating its lower limit .",
    "@xcite estimated the color excess for forty sniip events and from that sample we infer a median visual extinction of 0.80  mag .",
    "we note that this sample of relatively nearby sniip may not be representative of the magnitude - limited kepler discoveries , but it does suggest significant extinction is not unusual for sniip .",
    "the shape of the ksn2011a light curve is not as well fit by the @xcite prediction ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ rise ] ) even when the time to maximum and peak magnitude are well matched . in the first five days",
    "the ksn2011a light curve rises significantly faster than the model even though the same physics resulted in an excellent fit to the ksn2011d light curve . assuming a smaller progenitor radius does make the model rise faster , but that model will then peak much earlier than the observed 10.5 days .",
    "smaller assumed radii also produce a poor fit near maximum light for blue supergiant ( bsg ) models which differ from rsg in their density profile .",
    "the rapid rise in ksn2011a and the `` extra light '' above the @xcite model photosphere suggests the supernova shock continued to propagate into circumstellar material allowing it to convert more kinetic energy into luminosity and diffuse the shock breakout over a longer time .",
    "strong circumstellar interaction has been successful in explaining very luminous events @xcite , but progenitors with low mass loss rates may also see their early light curves enhanced with a weak shock interaction @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculations show that mass loss rates of order @xmath4 m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 will cause the early light curve to rise faster than a bare rsg , while not strongly affecting the optical peak luminosity or the light curve during the plateau .",
    "mass - loss rates less than @xmath4 m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 mean that the circumstellar medium near the progenitor radius is too low density to become optically thick when the shock hits it , so the presence of the wind would have no significant impact on the light curve even during the early rise .",
    "we therefore expect that the mild interaction seen in ksn2011a is due to a mass - loss rate just above the @xmath4 m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 threshold .",
    "the fast cadence and continuous coverage of kepler should , in principle , allow us to see the shock breakouts in these sniip . in the case of ksn2011a where we suspect circumstellar interaction ,",
    "the shock breakout was likely reprocessed over the diffusion time in the optically thick wind .",
    "the shock continued into the wind and converted additional kinetic energy into luminosity that we see as excess flux during the photospheric rise .",
    "the peak absolute kepler magnitude from the circumstellar interaction is @xmath17 mag , but much of the total energy is likely emitted at shorter wavelengths .      in the ksn2011d light curve ( fig .",
    "[ rise ] ) , there is a single 6-hour median flux point that deviates from the light curve model by 4 standard deviations ( @xmath18 ) at the time expected for shock breakout .",
    "a close - up of this time period is shown in fig .",
    "[ zoom ] using a binning width of 3.5 hours . extrapolating the @xcite photospheric model to zero flux predicts shock breakout at @xmath19  bjd which corresponds to the time of the largest deviation from the model .",
    "lccccccc ksn 2011a & 08480662 & iip & 0.051 & 0.194 & 19.66@xmath20 & 934.15@xmath21 & 10.5@xmath0 + ksn 2011d & 10649106 & iip & 0.087 & 0.243 & 20.23@xmath22 & 1040.75@xmath21 & 13.3@xmath0    when we subtract the best fit photosphere model for ksn2011d there remains seven kepler photometric observations within five hours of @xmath23 that are 3@xmath18 or more above zero ( lower panel in fig .",
    "[ zoom ] ) . to avoid bias that might come from dividing the data into bins",
    ", we have smoothed the light curve residuals using a gaussian with a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 3 hours .",
    "there is a clear 6@xmath18 peak at the time expected for breakout and we conclude that this is , indeed , the shock breakout from ksn2011d .",
    "the shock breakout flux is 12%  of the peak flux of the supernova , corresponding to a kepler magnitude of 22.3@xmath24 after correcting for milky way extinction .    in the @xcite shock breakout model ,",
    "the initial rise is the result of diffusion of the shock emission before the shock reaches the stellar surface and is only of order five minutes .",
    "this is too short a time for even the kepler cadence , so the rise to shock breakout is unresolved .",
    "after shock breakout the flux decay follows a @xmath25 power - law in time until the expanding photosphere dominates the luminosity .",
    "this decay is relatively slow and allows the breakout to remain detectable for several hours . from the @xcite formulation",
    ", we can estimate the ratio between the peak flux from the shock breakout , @xmath26 , and the maximum photospheric flux , @xmath27 , which we approximate as the brightness 10  days after explosion .",
    "using the ratio between the shock peak and photosphere maximum is particularly useful since it eliminates the uncertainty caused by distance and dust extinction . in the rest - frame",
    "optical ( 5500 ) the flux ratio is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the progenitor mass in units of 15  m@xmath2 , @xmath30 is the progenitor radius in units of 500  @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath33  erg .",
    "so we expect the shock breakout in a typical rsg to peak at about 25%  of visual brightness of the supernova at maximum .",
    "applying the @xcite model to ksn2011d ( radius of 490  r@xmath2 , energy of 2  b and a progenitor mass of 15  m@xmath2 ) , predicts a breakout temperature of 2@xmath34  @xmath35k , and equation  [ eq1 ] gives @xmath36 , meaning the shock should be 2  mag fainter in the optical than the supernova at maximum .",
    "the kepler 30  minute cadence will smooth the sharp peak of the breakout and lower the maximum by 20% so we expect the ratio to be @xmath37 .",
    "the excess flux seen in fig .",
    "[ zoom ] peaks at a relative flux of 0.12@xmath24 and is consistent with the @xcite prediction .",
    "we use a blackbody spectrum to extrapolate the shock breakout flux down to the optical and this is likely a poor approximation .",
    "so it is surprising that the semi - analytic model of @xcite works so well in matching the observed breakout .",
    "@xcite calculated realistic spectra at breakout for a variety of rsg models . while color temperatures and integrated luminosities varied greatly , the peak optical flux at breakout was fairly consistent : between @xmath38 to 1@xmath39 erg  s@xmath5  @xmath5 , corresponding to absolute magnitudes between @xmath40 and @xmath41 mag . the @xcite model for a 15  m@xmath2 , 1  b and 500  r@xmath2 rsg predicts a peak at m@xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are sdss magnitudes ( kepler calibration webpage ) ] mag .",
    "doubling the explosion energy would brighten the breakout by about 0.2  mag , yielding a luminosity of m@xmath45 mag .",
    "the observed shock breakout from ksn2011d is m@xmath46 mag ( after correction for milky way extinction ; assuming h@xmath47=70 km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 ) .",
    "overall , the models do an excellent job in predicting the optical brightness of the shock breakout in ksn2011d .",
    "we have simulated the light curve of ksn2011d using the statistical properties of the kepler photometry based on 100 days prior to the supernova detection ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ zoom ] ) .",
    "the photospheric rise of the light curve uses the @xcite model and the shock breakout uses the @xcite model with our best fit parameters .",
    "assuming gaussian statistics , we created a monte carlo simulation of the models sampled at the kepler cadence .",
    "the simulation matches the observed light curve extremely well and we again conclude that we have detected the shock breakout in ksn2011d .      in the 12 hours _ before _",
    "shock breakout there are only two of the 24 kepler observations that fall below the median pre - supernova flux .",
    "that is , the light curve of ksn2011d shows a possible slow rise in brightness starting 0.5  days before breakout .",
    "this is intriguing as core - collapse likely occurred nearly a day before shock breakout @xcite .",
    "the shock travels more slowly than photons diffuse through the rsg envelope , allowing evidence for the shock to reach the surface before breakout .",
    "however , @xcite predicts the shock energy would leak out through diffusion on a time - scale of only five minutes for a rsg .",
    "in contrast @xcite suggests a `` radiative precursor '' due to photon diffusion could begin hours before shock breakout and there is some evidence for a precursor seen in the galex detection of a sniip five hours before the peak breakout emission .",
    "while it is tantalizing to claim precursor emission in ksn2011d , the smoothed flux remains at 3@xmath18 or less from median value , so this detection is not definitive .",
    "more observations of sniip with extremely fast cadence are needed to determine the diffusion time - scale before shock breakout .",
    "we discovered two transient events in the kepler field with light curves that strongly suggest they are sniip events . from the fast cadence of the kepler observations",
    "we determine the time the supernova shock reached the surface of the progenitor with a precision of better than 0.1  days .",
    "we find the rise time to maximum was 10.5@xmath0 rest - frame days for ksn2011a and 13.3@xmath0 days for ksn2011d . from the rise times combined with their peak luminosities ( not corrected for host extinction ) , we estimate the progenitor radius of ksn2011a ( 280  r@xmath2 ) to be significantly smaller than that for ksn2011d ( 490  r@xmath2 ) but both have similar explosion energies of 2  b.    our directly measured rise - times for both kepler events are many standard deviations larger than the median rise - time of sniip estimated from an ensemble of light curves by @xcite .",
    "this difference results from the variation of rise - time with effective wavelength .",
    "@xcite referenced their rise - time to the sdss-@xmath43 band while light curves peak several days later in the redder kepler bandpass .",
    "the median radius of the progenitors estimated by @xcite is 320  r@xmath2 which is comparable to the radii we infer from the kepler data . as with the @xcite estimates ,",
    "radii measured from sniip light curves tend to be at the low end of the distribution of radii estimated for rsg directly observed in the milky way @xcite .",
    "some of this discrepancy may be due to the idealized analytic models failing to account for opacity changes near maximum light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the rising light curve of ksn2011d is an excellent match to that predicted by the @xcite models for rsg .",
    "however , the @xcite models underestimate the brightness of ksn2011a during the first five days and we suggest that the additional flux is due to the supernova shock moving into a pre - existing wind or mass - loss from the rsg . @xcite has shown that a mass loss rate of @xmath4 m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 will steepen the light curve while not strongly impacting the flux at maximum light or the shape of the post - maximum light curve .    no fast shock breakout emission is seen in ksn2011a , but this is likely due to the circumstellar interaction suspected in the early light curve",
