    "the wasa - at - cosy collaboration has presented recently striking evidence for a @xmath10 nonstrange dibaryon resonance some 8090 mev below @xmath11  gev , with a relatively small width of @xmath12  mev , by observing a distinct resonance in @xmath13 reactions @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , left panel .",
    "isospin @xmath14 is uniquely fixed in this particular @xmath15 production reaction and the spin - parity @xmath16 assignment follows from the measured deuteron and pions angular distributions , assuming @xmath17-wave @xmath2 decaying pair .",
    "the shape of the @xmath18 distribution on the right panel supports @xmath2 assignment and its peak at @xmath19  gev , almost at the @xmath20 @xmath5 dibaryon location ( see below ) , might suggest a possible role for @xmath21 in forming the @xmath2 dibaryon @xmath22 .         further evidence supporting the @xmath3 dibaryon assignment comes from very recent measurements of @xmath23 elastic scattering as a function of energy , taking sufficiently small steps around @xmath24  mev @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : newdata]left for the argand diagram of the @xmath25 partial wave , and in the right panel for the speed plot of the @xmath25 partial wave , within a new said partial wave analysis incorporating these measurements .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath2 @xmath17-wave dibaryon resonances @xmath26 with isospin @xmath27 and spin @xmath28 were proposed by dyson and xuong @xcite as early as 1964 , when quarks were still perceived as merely mathematical entities .",
    "they focused on the lowest - dimension su(6 ) multiplet in the @xmath29 product that contains the su(3 ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 multiplets in which the deuteron @xmath32 and @xmath33 virtual state @xmath34 are classified .",
    "this yields two dibaryon candidates , @xmath21 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath2 ) as listed in table  [ tab : dyson ] . identifying the constant @xmath35 in the resulting mass formula @xmath36 $ ] with the @xmath33 threshold mass 1878  mev , a value @xmath37  mev was reached by assigning @xmath21 to the @xmath38 resonance at @xmath39  mev ( near the @xmath5 threshold ) which was observed already during the 1950 s . this led to the prediction @xmath40=2350  mev .",
    "the @xmath22 dibaryon has been the subject of several quark - based model calculations since 1980 , see ref .",

    "the coupled faddeev equations give rise then to an effective @xmath5 lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation for the three - body @xmath28-matrix pole , with energy - dependent kernels that incorporate spectator - hadron propagators , as shown diagrammatically in fig .",

    "the two dibaryons are found to be degenerate to within less than 20  mev , close to the @xmath5 threshold at @xmath582.17  gev with a width similar to that of the @xmath52 baryon . in particular , the mass values calculated for @xmath21 are reasonably close to the values @xmath59  mev @xcite and @xmath60  mev @xcite derived in @xmath61@xmath62@xmath63 coupled - channel phenomenological analyses .",
