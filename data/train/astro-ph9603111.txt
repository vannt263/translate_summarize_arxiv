    "multifrequency radio observations of nearby , face - on galaxies present a unique way to study the cosmic ray ( cr ) propagation within their disks .",
    "these studies provide constraints on the main parameters of this propagation , i.e. the value and energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient and the form of the electron energy distribution immediately after acceleration . furthermore , because of the relatively long radiative life - time of cr electrons ( which is in normal , non - starburst galaxies up to several @xmath1 years ) such observations also provide information about the temporal evolution of the sources of the cr s on the same time scale ; in turn , since the sites of acceleration are supernova remnants the data are probing the history of star formation on time scales up to of order @xmath2 years .",
    "to date , the parameters describing cr propagation have only been derived for our galaxy ; radio observations are the only way of obtaining information for external galaxies . in this paper",
    "we analyse high - sensitivity multi - frequency radio data for the nearby galaxy ngc  2146 .",
    "our data have sufficient frequency coverage that we can include in our model fits both a thermal and diffuse synchrotron component for the radio emission .",
    "ngc  2146 is a very luminous radio source ( @xmath3  w / hz ) at a distance of 21.8 mpc ( benvenuti , capacioli & dodorico 1975 , adjusted to @xmath4=50 km s@xmath5 mpc ) .",
    "most of its radio luminosity is due to a compact starburst in its centre .",
    "the extent of the radio emission ( 1.5 arcmin @xmath6 9.6 kpc ) is much less than the extent of the optical emission ( @xmath6 6 arcmin ) .",
    "this suggests that active star formation ( both current and in the recent past ) is confined to this central region of ngc  2146 . in this paper",
    "we are only discussing this inner region of the galaxy ( @xmath6 1.5 arcmin @xmath7 0.7 arcmin ) that is characterized by the strong radio emission .",
    "optical images of ngc  2146 show it to be a peculiar spiral galaxy ( e.g. benvenuti et al . 1975 ) .",
    "hutchings et al .",
    "( 1990 ) have presented a detailed study of ngc  2146 in several wavebands and proposed that the galaxy is in the late stages of a merger which has given rise to an intense burst of star formation in the nucleus .",
    "ngc  2146 was observed with the vla at 8.4 ghz and 327  mhz , and with the cambridge 5-km ryle telescope ( rt ) at 5 and 15 ghz .",
    "additionally , existing vla data at 1.5  ghz ( condon 1983 ) were available . when the observations of ngc  2146 were made , the rt was operated with a band - width of 280  mhz split into 28 10-mhz frequency channels ; together with the minimum baseline of 18  m this provides excellent temperature sensitivity at both 5 and 15  ghz .    for the rt observations a total of five telescope configurations at each observing frequency",
    "were employed giving a nearly fully filled aperture out to the maximum baseline .",
    "a minimum of two 12-hour runs in each configuration were obtained ; any data of poor quality were rejected .",
    "this gave a resolution approximately @xmath8  arcsec@xmath9 at 15 ghz and @xmath10  arcsec@xmath9 at 5 ghz . at 5  ghz observations of phase - calibrators",
    "were made at the beginning and end of each run , while at 15  ghz calibration observations were interleaved with those of ngc  2146 .",
    "3c  286 and 3c  48 were observed regularly as flux calibrators .",
    "calibration and data - editing ( principally to remove narrow - band and time - varying interference ) was performed in the mrao package _ postmortem _ , with subsequent reduction in aips and the mrao package _",
    "the 8.4-ghz vla observations were in the b , c and d arrays with the 327  mhz observations in a array only ; the observations were performed during 1990/91 .",
    "reduction of the data followed standard vla procedures with calibration , editing and imaging performed in aips .",
    "a number of maps were made at each frequency by tapering the aperture - plane to highlight structure on different angular scales .",
    "for the spectral comparison we used only the four highest frequencies and all the maps were made with very similar aperture plane coverage , cleaned and restored ( or convolved in the case of the 1.49  ghz image ) to a common resolution of @xmath11  arcsec@xmath9 .",
    "all maps have been corrected for the primary beam response of the telescope used to make the observations .",
    "this set of four images is shown in fig . 1 , together with a high - resolution image at 15  ghz in fig . 2 and the 327  mhz image in fig .",
    "3 . in fig .",
    "4 a map of the spectral index between 1.5 and 8.4 ghz is shown .",
    "most of the radio emission of ngc  2146 lies along an elongated , bar - like structure in position angle @xmath12 coincident with the optical major axis ( 143@xmath13 , benvenuti et al .",
    "this elongated shape could be a disk viewed from a high inclination or it could be due to a real bar - like shape of the sources of the cr s . from the radio data at one frequency alone it is not possible to distinguish between these two cases .",
    "however , as will be shown in the following , the variations of the radio spectral index together with a model for the cr propagtion allow to draw conclusions about the shape of the cr sources . in the high resolution image ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the sources at 15 ghz show a distinctive * s * shape that had already been noticed in earlier observations by kronberg @xmath14 biermann ( 1981 ) .",
    "the central region is shown in our highest resolution images to contain a number of luminous unresolved sources superimposed on the general background emission .    at higher frequencies",
    "ngc  2146 appears more compact and shows relatively little emission away from the major axis of the radio emission while at lower frequencies the emission has an irregular appearance and several extensions perpendicular to the major axis which are prominent particularly in the 1.5  ghz and the 327  mhz images .",
    "our aim in this work is to explain the multi - frequency radio data by a combination of thermal emission and non - thermal synchrotron radiation from cr electrons which have propagated away from the sites where they have been accelerated .",
    "the thermal component arises in hii regions , whereas supernova remnants ( snrs ) are believed to be , at least from energetic considerations , the most likely source of crs ( e.g. berezinsky et al .",
    "1990 , vlk 1992 ) .",
    "the propagation of the cr electrons is described by a standard three dimensional diffusion model ( e.g. ginzburg & syrovatskii 1964 ) .",
    "other modes of propagation , such as convection , may also be important especially in the halo ( e.g. hummel @xmath14 dettmar 1990 ) at large distances from the galactic plane , but for the sake of simplicity we do not take this into account explicitly .",
    "our approach , therefore , is to determine to what extent we can explain the observations using a simple diffusion model alone .    the diffusion equation describing the evolution of the electron distribution function @xmath15 is as follows :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient , assumed to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is assumed to depend on the energy as @xmath18 which is in agreement with observations of crs in our galaxy ( see e.g. berezinsky et al .",
    "1990 ) . in the energy range relevant to our radio observations ( @xmath19  gev ) ,",
    "the energy losses of the electrons are mainly synchrotron and inverse compton @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the thompson scattering cross section , @xmath22 the speed of light , @xmath23 the energy density of the magnetic field and @xmath24 the energy density of the radiation field below the klein - nishima limit ( e.g. longair 1992 ) .    for the source function @xmath25 we make the following assumptions :    1",
    ".   the total source distribution can be separated and expressed as the sum of individual sources i.e. @xmath26 2 .",
    "crs are produced only by snrs from massive stars ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the source spectrum is assumed to be a power - law in energy and to be identical for all sources @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the sn rate and @xmath30 is the number of relativistic electrons produced on average per energy interval by a snr .",
    "the spatial distribution of a source is approximated by an ellipsoid , gaussian distribution @xmath31 \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with ( @xmath32 ) indicating the site of the centre of the source and @xmath33 the axes of the ellipsoid . in the following",
    ", we will identify the major axes of ngc  2146 with the x - axis , the direction within the galactic plane perpendicular to the major axis with the y- and the direction perpendicular to the plane with the z - axis .",
    "eq.(1 ) can be solved for an infinite space following the analysis of syrovatskii ( 1959 ) . in a steady - state situation ( i.e. for constant sources",
    ") the electron distribution function is given by : @xmath34\\right\\ } \\over ( 4\\lambda+{r_{x , i}}^2)^{1\\over 2 } ( 4\\lambda+{r_{y , i}}^2)^{1\\over 2 } ( 4\\lambda+ { r_{z , i}}^2)^{1\\over 2 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 are the upper and lower end of the range of electron injection energies and @xmath36 is given by : @xmath37    if temporal changes are important , a similar solution for @xmath15 can be derived .",
    "the synchrotron emission @xmath38 is derived from @xmath15 with the simplifying assumption that each electron emits its synchrotron radiation at the maximum frequency of the synchrotron spectrum . @xmath39 with the emitting frequency being @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gyrofrequency .",
    "the thermal emission is also described as arising from ellipsoidal sources , that are not necessarily the same as the cr sources @xmath42 both , @xmath43 and @xmath44 have to be integrated through the halo along the line of sight , taking into account the inclination angle of the galaxy , and convolved with the beam . the total radio emission , @xmath45 , is finally obtained as the sum of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in order to keep the diffusion model as simple as possible we shall assume a steady state , i.e. we attempt to fit a model in which the star formation rate and hence the sources of thermal and non - thermal emission do not show any temporal variations . in ngc  2146",
    "the estimated life - time of cr electrons is , due to the high radiation losses ( see below ) , extremely short ( less than @xmath46 years ) . on these short time",
    "scales the assumption of a steady state seems reasonable .",
    "furthermore we will assume as the simplest case that hii regions and supernova remnants are co - spatial ( at least at the resolution of our radio images ) .",
    "this will be a good approximation if the sites of star formation have not changed during the past @xmath47 years , i.e. the life - time of supernova progenitors ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "if there has been significant propagation of the star formation process through the galaxy then this assumption must be modified .",
    "additionally we can constrain some of the parameters directly from observational data .",
    "\\1 ) the inclination of ncg  2146 is @xmath49 ( benvenuti et al . 1975 ) .",
    "due to the disturbed appearance of ngc  2146 the inclination angle is unlikely to be precisely determined ; we shall adopt this value and discuss this point more fully in section 6.1 .",
    "the radius of the cr sources perpendicular to the disk is taken to be @xmath50pc , which is a typical scale height of the molecular gas disk ( e.g. unsld & baschek 1991 ) in which we expect massive star formation to be located .",
    "\\2 ) we estimate the magnetic field @xmath51 by applying a minimum energy calculation .",
    "we adopt standard values for most parameters : a frequency range of @xmath52 ghz ; radio spectral index 0.7 ( here and in the following we define the spectral index @xmath53 as @xmath54 ) ; ratio of total energy of cr s to total energy of electrons @xmath55 . for measured quantities",
    "we use the emission at 1.5  ghz .",
    "we obtain the volume of the emitting region at this frequency by assuming that it can be approximated by a cylinder with a height 1  kpc and a radius of 45  arcsec ( @xmath56 5kpc ) which corresponds to the lowest contour of the 1.5  ghz image . with these assumptions",
    "we obtain @xmath57 .",
    "the energy density of the radiation field , @xmath24 , can be calculated from the bolometric luminosity : @xmath58.\\ ] ] for ngc  2146 the greatest part of its luminosity is emitted in the far - infrared ( fir ) ; we therefore approximate the bolometric luminosity @xmath59 by the far - infrared luminosity @xmath60 . for the radius @xmath61",
    "we take the radius derived from our radio data ( @xmath62 kpc ) as this will correspond to the region in which most star formation is currently occurring . with these assumptions",

    ", the fitting of the diffusion model now proceeds by fitting to slices extracted from our multi - frequency radio images along both the major and minor axis of ngc  2146 . in figs . 5 and 6 we show the observational data and the corresponding model fits .    in constraining the parameters for the model we note some general features of the data",
    "\\i ) the spectral index between 1.5 and 8.4 ghz is approximately constant along the major axis ( fig .",
    "8a ) ; this suggests that the cr source is itself extended in this direction unless the diffusion coefficient had a strong energy dependence with @xmath65 .",
    "( in this latter case @xmath36 ( eq . 8) would be largely independent of the electron energy and hence the spatial distribution of the electrons would also be energy independent ( see eq .",
    "\\ii ) the steepening of the spectrum away from the major axis ( fig .",
    "8) indicates that @xmath66 is considerably less than one and that the electrons must have suffered from energy losses .",
    "\\iii ) the radio flux decreases away from the centre of the galaxy both along the major and minor axis ( figs . 5 and 6 ) .    taken together , these observations suggest that the model should have the following general characteristics :    * the source distribution is extended along the major axis but not along the minor axis , i.e. it has the shape of a bar . * the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath66 , must be considerably less than unity , and is constrained by the data along the minor axis of ngc  2146 .",
    "the fitting of the model to the observational data now proceeds by a straightforward search of parameter space for model parameters which lead to the best fit of the multi - frequency radio data .",
    "the model most strongly constrains the spatial distribution and strength of the thermal and non - thermal emission regions , and also the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "our results and conclusions for the simplest form of the model without temporal variations are shown in fig .",
    "5 and can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 ) the source structure can not be adequately represented by a single ellipsoidal emission region .",
    "two sources , both centred at the maximum of the radio emission , are necessary to account for the data .",
    "our best fit parameters for these two sources are :    - : :    source 1 : @xmath67 kpc , @xmath68    kpc , relative intensity 1 - : :    source 2 : @xmath69 kpc , @xmath70    kpc , relative intensity 0.3    we interpret this result as suggesting that the distribution of cr sources and hence star formation activity is in the form of a bar .",
    "the parameters describing source 1 are relatively well constrained by the shape of the radio emission ( for a fixed value of the galaxy inclination ) .",
    "the parameters of source 2 are less well constrained , however this has a relatively minor effect on the other model parameters .",
    "\\2 ) the injection index of the electron population is @xmath71 and we infer a low thermal fraction of @xmath72 per cent at 15 ghz .",
    "the thermal fraction is constrained by the radio spectrum at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "\\3 ) it is clear from fig .",
    "5 that we are not able , with the simplest form of the model , to get good fits to the data over the whole frequency range : at 5 , 8.4 and 15  ghz the model predictions for the peak radio emission are either slightly too low or too high .",
    "the discrepancies however never exceed 10 @xmath73 and it should furthermore be noted that the _ shape _ of the radio emission can be reproduced well at all frequencies .",
    "the results obtained by allowing for temporal variations in the star formation rate , while keeping the source distribution constant are shown in fig .",
    "6 . in this case , an injection index of @xmath74 is used and the temporal variations are assumed to have a simple form with injection of cr electrons having stopped @xmath75 years ago .",
    "the predicted thermal contribution is now much greater than in the steady - state model . at 15",
    "ghz the emission is almost completely thermal and at 1.5 ghz the thermal fraction is still @xmath76 per cent .",
    "the time - dependent solution produces an improved model fit as it permits an aged electron population to develop . in general , for both the steady - state and time - dependent cases , the fits along the major axis are worse than those along the minor axis  this is because of the structure of @xmath45 which reflects the complicated intrinsic source structure ( see fig .",
    "2 ) which we have not taken into account . however , this does not significantly effect are conclusions concerning propagation of cr to be discussed below .",
    "\\4 ) the value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 , and its energy dependence , is strongly constrained by the data perpendicular to the inferred bar within ngc  2146 along the minor axis .",
    "furthermore , the results are very similar for both the steady - state and a time - dependent models . in fig .",
    "7 we show the results for the steady - state case  the best fit for the diffusion coefficient is @xmath77@xmath78s@xmath5 , with @xmath79 .",
    "the shape of the spectral index distribution along the minor axis depends sensitively on @xmath66 , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "our best estimate for @xmath66 is in the range @xmath80 with a firm upper limit of @xmath81 .",
    "as illustrated in fig . 5 - 8 the model describes the data well and allows us to constrain important parameters such as the diffusion coefficient and its energy dependence and",
    "infer the existence of a central bar .",
    "the error in the determination of these parameters depends however not only on the quality of the model fit , but also on a number of parameters that were determined independently such as @xmath82 , the inclination angle and distance of the ngc  2146 . in order to fit the spectral data a model that produces a break in the synchrotron spectrum",
    "is required  this is evident from the data since the spectrum at the centre of ngc  2146 steepens between 5 and 8.4 ghz before flattening towards 15 ghz which we attribute to thermal emission .",
    "the simplest way to achieve such a break is to assume some temporal dependence of the cr injection and hence of the star - formation rate .",
    "the time - scale of the changes implied by the data is rather short , less than @xmath83 years , however there is a strong dependence on @xmath51 and @xmath24 : @xmath84 . whereas our estimate for @xmath24 does not suffer from large uncertainties ,",
    "@xmath51 is very uncertain and an improved estimate would require an independent determination of the magnetic field .",
    "the main sources of error for the diffusion coefficient , @xmath0 , are the uncertainty in @xmath24 , @xmath51 , the distance to ngc  2146 and the assumed structure of the emitting region . in principle",
    "it could be possible to increase / decrease the size of the cr source along the minor axis ( @xmath85 ) and try to fit the data by decreasing / increasing @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath86 is very small , even with a large value of @xmath0 the model can not produce the observed shape of @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "a larger assumed source size would make it impossible to fit the spectral variations unless we assumed that either the injection index of the cr population varied within the disc of the galaxy , and/or that different regions of the galaxy had undergone very different star - formation histories . within the range of acceptable @xmath85 the estimated values for @xmath0 all lie within our quoted error bounds .",
    "the uncertainty in the inclination angle of ngc  2146 does not affect our estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath66 greatly and it most strongly affects the assumed source size .",
    "our conclusion regarding the bar - like shape of the star forming region depends therefore sensitively on the assumed inclination angle .",
    "however , only for a severe underestimate of the true inclination angle of ngc  2146 ( i.e. if @xmath87 ) this conclusion can not be maintained . in this case",
    "the radio emission along the minor axis would be almost entirely from the halo .",
    "the diffusion model is a good fit to the radio data for ngc  2146 along the major axis of the galaxy and along the minor axis for distances less than 10 arcsec ( 2.6  kpc ) from the major axis .",
    "this suggests that diffusion is the dominant mode of propagation in this region which corresponds to the inner , most actively star forming disc of ngc  2146 .    at distances greater than 10 arcsec from the centre of the galaxy along the minor axis",
    "the model is no longer an adequate fit to the data ( figs . 5 and 6 ) . the shape of the 1.5  ghz emissivity is very flat suggesting that transport of cr electrons is more efficient than would be expected from diffusion alone .",
    "furthermore , the spectral index flattens which indicates that ( i ) the energy losses have decreased rapidly , or ( ii ) the diffusion coefficient increases , or ( iii ) a much faster process than diffusion is responsible for the transport of the cr electrons . upon examination of the radio emission in the region where the diffusion model begins to fail",
    "we note that the radio images ( figs .",
    "1 and 3 ) show filamentary structure .",
    "the most likely reason for this behaviour is that away from the centre of the galaxy a large fraction of the radio emission is from a halo which is seen in projection .",
    "the propagation of cr electrons in the halo might be more complicated than we have considered for the propagation within the disc .",
    "evidence for this comes from observations of the edge - on galaxies ngc  891 and ngc  4631 where extended radio continuum emission in the halo with a rather flat spectral index has been observed ( hummel 1991 ) .",
    "breitschwerdt ( 1994 ) has explained this flat spectral index in a galactic wind model including diffusive and convective transport of cr s .",
    "siemieniec and cesarsky ( 1991 ) modelled the spectral index in the halo of ngc 891 by a diffusion model with an outwardly increasing diffusion coefficient .",
    "both galaxies show that in the halo the propagation of cr electrons is faster than that predicted by steady - state diffusion alone",
    ".    due to the strong star formation activity in ngc  2146 , an outflow from the disc triggered by correlated sn explosions may be present , a mechanism which is variously described as a `` galactic fountain '' ( shapiro & field 1976 ) or `` chimney '' model ( ikeuchi 1988 , norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) . such an outflow would transport cr s and magnetic field into the halo and could therefore account for a higher radio emission in the halo than expected from a pure diffusion model . the analysis of x - ray and optical data of ngc  2146 ( armus et al .",
    "1995 ) has shown that there are indeed indications of the existence of such a starburst - driven superwind .",
    "hutchings et al .",
    "( 1990 ) proposed that ngc  2146 is in the late stage of a merger .",
    "the merger must have begun @xmath88 years ago as the rotation curve does not appear to be disrupted in the outer regions of the galaxy ( young et al .",
    "1988a , show the inner regions of the galaxy to have non - circular motions of the order of 100 km s@xmath5 ) . in this scenario material has collapsed into the centre of the galaxy and a starburst has commenced in the nucleus .",
    "the data and model presented in this paper further emphasize that active star formation is confined only to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the radio images show that the star formation activity is located in a peculiar spiral * s * shape around the peak of the radio emission .",
    "the merger may have triggered the formation of a bar which feeds the nuclear starburst with material and is responsible for the unusual structure of the radio emission .",
    "star formation is proceeding all along the central bar , and the nucleus is not prominent in the high - resolution radio images .",
    "young et al .",
    "( 1988a ) suggest that if the galaxy is in the late stage of a merger the nucleus of the merging companion could be obscured by the dust lane .",
    "the images of the radio emission presented here argue against this as we do not find two spatially distinct peaks of radio emission which could be identified as the nuclei of the merging systems .",
    "instead , the star formation is distributed throughout the bar - like central region .",
    "the unresolved sources seen on our highest resolution images have sizes of less than 100  pc and may represented isolated pockets of star formation or could be individual high - luminosity supernovae as seen in m82 ( muxlow _ et al .",
    "the presence of dynamical features such as the arm in the h@xmath53 emission ( young , kleinmann & allen 1988b ) and the bar in the radio emission suggest that this starburst is dynamically driven , i.e. due to a merger or an interaction .",

    "<S> we present high - sensitivity multi - frequency radio continuum observations of the starburst galaxy ngc  2146 . </S>",
    "<S> we have fitted these data with a three - dimensional diffusion model . </S>",
    "<S> the model can describe the radio emission from the inner disk of ngc  2146 well , indicating that diffusion is the dominant mode of propagation in this region . </S>",
    "<S> our results are indicating that ngc  2146 has recently undergone a starburst , the star forming activity being located in a central bar . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial variation of the radio emission and of the spectral index yield tight constraints on the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 and the energy dependence of the diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> away from the central bar of the galaxy the radio emission becomes filamentary and the diffusion model was found to be a poor fit to the data in these regions ; we attribute this to different transport processes being important in the halo of the galaxy .    </S>",
