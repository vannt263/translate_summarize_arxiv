    "although the study of phase transitions is one of the main subjects of mathematical statistical mechanics , examples of models exhibiting phase transition are mainly restricted to lattice systems . in the continuous setting results",
    "are much harder to obtain , e.g. , the proof of a liquid - vapor phase transition in @xcite , or the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in two dimensions for a delaunay hard - equilaterality like interaction @xcite .",
    "these phase transitions manifest themselves in breaking of a continuous symmetry",
    ". there is another specific model for which a phase transition is known to occur : the model of widom and rowlinson @xcite .",
    "this is a multi - type particle system in @xmath0 , with hard - core exclusion between particles of different type , and no interaction between particles of the same type .",
    "the phase transition in this model was stablished by ruelle @xcite . lebowitz and lieb @xcite extended his result by replacing the hard - core exclusion by a soft - core repulsion between unlike particles .",
    "finally , phase transition results for a general class of continuum potts models in @xmath0 , have been derived in @xcite .",
    "the repulsive interaction between particles of different type in @xcite is of finite range and a type - independent background potential has been added .",
    "the phase transitions for large activities in all these systems reveal themselves in breaking of the symmetry in the type - distribution .",
    "the results in @xcite are based an a random - cluster representation analogous to the fortuin - kasteleyn representation of lattice potts models , see @xcite",
    ". in @xcite the soft repulsion in @xcite between unlike particles has been replaced by another kind of soft repulsion based on the structure of some graph .",
    "more precisely , the finite range repulsion between particles of different type acts only on a nearest neighbour subgraph of the delaunay graph in @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we establish the existence of phase transitions for two different classes of continuum delaunay potts models in @xmath2 including the widom - rowlinson model . the repulsive interaction between unlike particles in all models",
    "is of infinite range , and it depends in one class on the geometry of the delaunay triangle ( minimal angle ) and in another class on the delaunay edge when the interaction decays with the length of the edge .",
    "all our models come with a hard - core background interaction which is independent of the type of the particles .",
    "we believe that one can extend our results by removing this hard - core constraint , see remark  [ softcore ] below .",
    "our results extend @xcite and @xcite in two ways by having an infinite range repulsion and a geometry - dependency of the type interaction .",
    "gibbs models on delaunay structures have been studied in @xcite , and our results rely on the existence of gibbs measures for geometry - dependent interactions established in @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on a delaunay random - cluster representation similar to @xcite and @xcite , the difference being that we replace edge percolation by an adaptation of lattice hyperedge percolation @xcite to our continuum setting .",
    "a phase transition for our delaunay potts models follows if we can show that the corresponding percolation process contains an infinite cluster .",
    "a similar program was carried out by chayes et al . in @xcite for the hard - core widom - rowlinson model . in that case",
    ", the existence of infinite clusters follows from a stochastic comparison with the poisson boolean model of continuum percolation , while our framework uses a coarse graining method to derive a stochastic comparison with site percolation on @xmath3 .",
    "this idea actually goes back to @xcite in which percolation for the poisson voronoi model has been established .",
    "we note that our random - cluster representation requires the symmetry of the type interaction . in the non - symmetric widom - rowlinson models ,",
    "the existence of a phase transition has been established by bricmont et al .",
    "@xcite , and recently by suhov et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we conclude with some remarks on the particular features models defined on the delaunay hypergraph structure show . the most simple delaunay potts model would be one with no more interaction than constant delaunay edge interaction as then the percolation would be independent of the activity parameter .",
    "our triangle model is a step towards understanding this system .",
    "we draw attention to some differences between geometric models on the delaunay hypergraph structure and that of classical models such as the widom - rowlinson model and its soft - core variant of lebowitz and lieb @xcite .",
    "the first is that edges and triangles in the delaunay hypergraph are each proportional in number to the number of particles in the configuration .",
    "however , in the case of the complete hypergraph the number of edges is proportional to the number of particles squared and the number of triangles is proportional to the number of particles cubed .",
    "secondly , in the complete graph of the classical models , the neighbourhood of a given point depends only on the distance between points and so the number of neighbours increases with the activity parameter @xmath4 of the underlying point process .",
    "this means that the system will become strongly connected for high values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is not the case for the delaunay hypergraphs which exhibit a self - similar property .",
    "essentially , as the activity parameter @xmath5 increases , the expected number of neighbours to a given point in the delaunay hypergraph remains the same , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to keep a strong connectivity in our geometric models on delaunay hypergraphs , we use a type interaction between particles of a hyperedge with a non - constant mark .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , is the question of additivity .",
    "namely , suppose we have an existing particle configuration @xmath6 and we want to add a new particle @xmath7 to it .",
    "in the case of classical many - body interactions , this addition will introduce new interactions that occur between @xmath7 and the existing configuration @xmath6 .",
    "however , the interactions between particles of @xmath8 remain unaffected , and so classical many - body interactions are additive . on the other hand , in the delaunay framework , the introduction of a new particle to an existing configuration not only creates new edges and triangles , but destroys some too .",
    "the delaunay interactions are therefore not additive , and for this reason , attractive and repulsive interactions are indistinct . in the case of a hard exclusion interaction ,",
    "we arrive at the possibility that a configuration @xmath9 is excluded , but for some @xmath7 , @xmath10 is not .",
    "this is called the non - hereditary property @xcite , which seems to rule out using techniques such as stochastic comparisons of point processes @xcite .",
    "we consider configurations of points in @xmath2 with internal degrees of freedom , or marks .",
    "let @xmath11 , be the finite set of different marks .",
    "that is , each marked point is represented by a position @xmath12 and a mark @xmath13 , and each marked configuration @xmath14 is a countable subset of @xmath15 having a locally finite projection onto @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the set of all marked configurations with locally finite projection onto @xmath2",
    ". we will sometimes identify @xmath14 with a vector @xmath17 of pairwise disjoint locally finite sets @xmath18 in @xmath2 ( we write @xmath19 for the set of all locally finite configurations in @xmath2 ) .",
    "any @xmath14 is uniquely determined by the pair @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the set of all occupied positions , and where the mark function @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 if @xmath24 . for each measurable set @xmath25 in @xmath15",
    "the counting variable @xmath26 on @xmath16 gives the number of marked particles such that the pair ( position , mark ) belongs to @xmath25 .",

    "we describe this in terms of hypergraph structures .",

    "@xmath60 ) .",
    "we outline the definitions for the unmarked configurations first with obvious adaptations to the case of marked point configurations .",

    "it is possible that @xmath71 consists of four or more points on a sphere with no points inside .",

    "more precisely , this means that no four points lie on the boundary of a circle and every half - plane contains at least one point .",

    "the set in is uniquely determined and defines a triangulation of the convex hull of @xmath9 whenever @xmath9 is in general position ( @xcite ) . in a similar way one can define the marked delaunay hyperedges , i.e. , @xmath77 and @xmath78 as measurable sets in @xmath60 where the delaunay property refers to the spatial component only .    given a configuration @xmath79 ( or @xmath14 ) we write @xmath80 ( resp .",

    "we obtain the existence of gibbs measures for large enough activity only .",
    "this is mainly due to the techniques used in @xcite for the existence of gibbs measures ( @xcite ) .",
    "the restriction originates from the need to obtain an upper bound for the hamiltonian for some chosen configurations , namely , the so - called pseudo - periodic configurations ( see appendix  [ pseudoperiodic ] or @xcite ) .",

    "the edge model is an infinite range type - interaction while keeping a hard - core background potential as in @xcite , where it is used on one hand to obtain a bound on the number of connected components in the hypergraph @xmath144 once a point is inserted into a configuration , and on the other hand , to bound the number of points in a coarse graining scheme .",
    "we have replaced the bound on the number of connected components by a bound of the expectation under the edge drawing measure using the hard - core background potential and an sufficient decay of the type interaction .",

    "our triangle models have an infinite range type interaction .",
    "we obtain phase transitions for sufficiently large activity and parameter @xmath138 for two models with infinite range type interactions .",
    "the idea for the triangle model i is that tiles ( triangles ) whose minimal angles exceed a given threshold @xmath145 gain in probability when their vertices are of the same type .",
    "the energy of a triangle with minimal angle is given by the constant value of the type potential @xmath146 . in our second triangle model ii , however , this incentive is not constant as it grows with the minimal angle and it decays with shrinking minimal angle .",
    "[ thm - main ] the following holds for the triangle models .    *",

    "i note that our proof techniques require the minimal angle threshold @xmath145 to be sufficiently small , see lemma  [ lemtmi ] .",
    "in contrast to this , the triangle model ii allows the smallest angles to take any value as smaller values experience vanishing preference for type alignment in a triangle .",
    "[ softcore ] in all our models we add a hard - core background potential between pairs of particles .",
    "this is for technical reasons only , and we believe that it is possible to replace it by some triangle potential excluding minimal angles below a given threshold ( see @xcite ) , or by the hard - equilaterality model ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "these triangle background potentials are of infinite range in terms of delaunay edges ( pairs of particles ) .",
    "they allow to bound easily the number of connected components in the delaunay random - cluster model once a new point is inserted . on the other hand inserting a point in an empty cell",
    "now depends on all the points in neighbouring cells .",
    "an adaptation of our coarse graining method in section  [ tileperc ] and restricting to certain admissible boundary conditions for the cells allows to estimate the probability of injecting a single particle .",
    "another possibility is to replace the hard - core background pair potential by a superstable pair potential ( soft - core background ) as in @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this allows to control the number of particles in cells and to estimate the probability of insertion of single points , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , for the final percolation argument it seems an additional multi scale approach is needed , which is based in our coarse graining technique in section  [ tileperc ] .",
    "suppose that in each of the sub cells ( paralleloptopes ) there is a region with a finite number of points .",
    "then , due to the chosen partition of @xmath1 , there will be delaunay triangles connecting these regions in the different cells .",
    "these triangles have then a minimal angle and will thus be open with high probability .",
    "thus all the regions in the different cells are connected with open triangles leaving the questions whether within these regions all triangle are open as well .",
    "we think that this can be achieved by some kind a renormalisation approach with a combined bond - site percolation as in @xcite .",
    "we hope to approach this idea using delaunay potentials studied in @xcite replacing the standard pair potential in the future ( @xcite ) .",
    "one may wonder if the phase transitions manifest itself thermodynamically by a non - differentiability ( `` discontinuity '' ) of the free energy ( pressure ) . using the techniques from @xcite and @xcite , it should be possible to obtain a variational representation of the free energy , see also @xcite for free energy representations for marked configurations .",
    "then a discontinuity of the free energy can be established using our results above . for continuum potts models",
    "this has been established in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  4.3 ) . for a class of bounded triangle potential",
    "@xcite shows that the gibbs measures are minimisers of the free energy .",
    "the free energy is the level-3 large deviation rate functional for empirical processes , see @xcite .    to establish uniqueness of the gibbs measure in our delaunay potts models one can use the delaunay random - cluster measure @xmath149 , to be defined in below . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  6.10 ) uniqueness is established once the probability of an open connection of the origin to infinity is vanishing for the limiting lattice version of the random - cluster measure , that is , for some set @xmath150 containing the origin , @xmath151 for a sequence of boxes @xmath152 with @xmath153 as @xmath154 .",
    "one way to achieve this , is to obtain an stochastic domination of the delaunay random - cluster measure by the so - called random delaunay edge model of hard - core particles . using @xcite we know that the critical probabilities for both , the site and bond percolation on the delaunay graph , are bounded from below . extension to our tile ( hyperedge )",
    "percolation using @xcite can provide a corresponding lower bound as well .",
    "thus , if our parameter @xmath138 is chosen sufficiently small , then there is no percolation in our delaunay random - cluster measures and therefore uniqueness of the gibbs measure .",
    "it goes without saying that the results addressed here are merely a first step towards a closer study of phase transitions with geometry - dependent interactions .",
    "the study for widom - rowlinson or potts models with geometry - dependent interaction is by far not complete , one may wish to extend the single tile ( edge or triangle ) interaction to mutual adjacent voronoi cell interaction .",
    "the common feature of all these ferromagnetic systems is that phase transitions are due to breaking the symmetry of the type distribution .",
    "breaking of continuous symmetries is a much harder business , see e.g. @xcite , which shows a breaking of rotational symmetry in two dimensions , and which can be seen as a model of oriented particles in @xmath2 with a delaunay hard - equilaterality interaction .",
    "models studied in @xcite may be natural candidates for the existence of a crystallisation transition .",
    "a recent ground state study ( zero temperature ) @xcite for multi - body interactions of wasserstein types shows optimality of the triangular lattice .",
    "it seems to be promising to analyse this model for non - zero temperature in terms of crystallisation transition .",
    "we will investigate this further .",
    "another direction for the class of ferromagnetic models with geometry - dependent interaction is to analyse closer the percolation phenomena , and in particular to study the conformal invariance of crossing probabilities as done for the voronoi percolation ( @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "last but not least it is interesting to study the higher dimensional cases in @xmath155 , as well ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that our results still hold for these cases but there are some technical issues related to the general quadratic position such that we defer that analysis for future study .    the rest of the paper is organised a follows . in section  [ delcluster ]",
