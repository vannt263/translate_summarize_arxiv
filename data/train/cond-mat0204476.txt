    "in a couple of last years , there has been an increasing activity in the study of the structure and the time evolution of complex random networks @xcite .",
    "real data have been analyzed and at the same time many simplified models have been formulated and investigated .",
    "the applications in different contexts are ranging from evolution of www and internet , over evolution of metabolic networks to the structure of social networks , or linguistic networks .",
    "detailed mechanisms of evolution differ from one problem to another , nevertheless , some common features have been already identified .",
    "for example , it was revealed that many networks are _ scale free _ , i.e. , the distribution of the connectivity of nodes ( vertices ) is a power - law .",
    "it was shown that the scale free structure can be reproduced in the case of growing systems by models with the preferential attachment for adding new nodes @xcite .",
    "the challenging open problem is to clarify what are the universal feature of network dynamics , if any .",
    "the concept of scale free networks does not provide a classification into universality classes .",
    "a wide range of exponents was found by analysis of the real data , and the exponents in models with preferential attachment can take an arbitrary value larger than two @xcite . moreover , this concept deals with the internal structure of the networks rather than with possible types of dynamics .",
    "it is of interest to explore the time dependence of global characteristics of networks .",
    "two such global quantities are the size of the network @xmath0 and the mean connectivity @xmath1 .",
    "the size of the network is the total number of nodes and the mean connectivity is defined as the average of the degrees of nodes ( the local connectivities ) over all nodes in the network .",
    "different types of the network evolution can be encountered . in some cases ,",
    "one observe a rapid increase of the network size , the typical example being the internet .",
    "another systems , e.g. linguistic networks , seem to be in a stationary state with an approximately constant size . similarly the mean connectivity can also increase or saturate .",
    "the situation clearly depends on the time scale considered .",
    "a network which is rapidly growing in a certain time interval may after some transient reach a stationary state .",
    "a system which looks to be stationary or only slowly varying in a limited time interval may exhibit strong fluctuations on a long time scale .",
    "the network size and the mean connectivity are expected to fluctuate in real systems .",
    "the fluctuation and/or shortage of reliable real data in a sufficiently long time interval can result in difficulty or even impossibility of tracing the general trends .",
    "however , the fluctuations can be reduced by averaging over many independent realizations when the evolution is explored by the simulations of simplified models .",
    "then the information about the time behaviour can be extracted , and bias or saturation can be revealed .",
    "one can ask what are the time dependences of the global quantities , whether there are generic scenarios of the network evolution etc .    in this letter ,",
    "we study the time evolution of global characteristics in the model which has been recently introduced by us in the context of study of the biological evolution @xcite . we found that the averaged network size and the averaged mean connectivity initially increase as power - laws and later saturate .",
    "we show that these quantities exhibit dynamical scaling analogous to the scaling revealed previously in the study of surface growth @xcite .",
    "the existence of scaling invariance suggests the possible universal behaviour .",
    "therefore , we check the sensitivity to modifications of the model .",
    "to fix ideas , we briefly describe our model . the model is based on extremal dynamics @xcite with particular rules for adding and removing a node .",
    "the system is composed of @xmath2 nodes , connected by links .",
    "the state of each node is described by a single dynamical variable @xmath3 , called barrier . in each step , the following dynamical rules @xcite are applied :    _ ( i ) _ the node with minimum @xmath4 is found and mutated .",
    "the barrier of the mutated node is replaced by a new random value @xmath5 .    _",
    "( ii ) _ the barriers of all nodes linked to the selected unit are also replaced by new random numbers . if @xmath5 is larger than barriers of all its linked neighbours , the node gives birth to a new node ( speciation ) .",
    "if @xmath5 is lower than barriers of all linked neighbours , the node dies out ( extinction ) . in remaining cases ,",
    "the number of nodes remains unchanged .",
    "the motivation of these rules is the following .",
    "well - adapted nodes proliferate more rapidly and chance for speciation is higher",
    ". however , if the local diversity , measured by connectivity of the node , is bigger , there are fewer available possibilities for the change and the probability of speciation is lower . on the other hand ,",
    "poorly adapted nodes are more vulnerable to extinction , but at the same time larger diversity ( larger connectivity ) may favour the survival .    _",
    "( iii ) _ speciation means , that a new node is added into the system , with a random barrier .    _",
    "( iv ) _ the links are established between the new node and the neighbours of the mutated node : each link of the `` mother '' node is inherited with the probability @xmath6 by the `` daughter '' node . the rule _",
    "( iv ) _ reflects the fact that the new node is to a certain extent a copy of the original , so the relations to the environment will be initially similar to the ones the old node has",
    ". moreover , if a node which speciates has only one neighbour , a link between `` mother '' and `` daughter '' is also established .",
    "similar models with the duplication of the local geometry were recently used for modeling of protein interaction network @xcite .    _",
    "( v ) _ when the node is extinct it means , that the node is removed without any substitution and all links it has , are broken .",
    "as a boundary condition , we use the following exception : if the network consists of a single isolated node only , it never dies out . we suppose that a node completely isolated from the rest of the system has lower chance to survive .",
    "this leads to the following rule .    _",
    "( vi ) _ if a node dies out , all its neighbours which are not connected to any other node die out with the probability @xmath7 .",
    "we call this kind of extinctions _",
    "singular extinctions_.    we previously showed that the model is self - organized critical @xcite . here , we focus on scaling with time . in all simulations below , the evolution starts with a single node .",
    "in this part , we restrict ourself to the situation @xmath8 ( all isolated nodes will die out ) , but we consider different values of the parametr @xmath6 .",
    "the size @xmath2 as well as the connectivity @xmath9 averaged over all nodes strongly fluctuate during the evolution ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 in @xcite ) , and no clear tendency can be deduced .",
    "however , two different regimes are identified after averaging over many independent runs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n - c - evol ] ) .",
    "a crossover time @xmath10 between two regimes depends on the parameter @xmath6 . in the initial stage @xmath11 , both averaged quantities increase as power - laws @xmath12 with the exponents @xmath13 and @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is a statistical average , and the bar denotes an average over nodes . in the second regime , the averaged number of nodes @xmath16 and therefore also the averaged mean connectivity @xmath17 saturate after times @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the crossover times @xmath18 and @xmath19 are different ( @xmath19 being smaller that @xmath18 ) .",
    "the saturated values @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the times of saturation @xmath18 and @xmath19 increase with @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 controls correlations between the structure of the neighbourhood of the `` mother '' node and the `` daughter '' node .",
    "we define @xmath22 as an analog of the correlation length .",
    "we have found that the saturated values @xmath20 , @xmath21 depend on @xmath23 as powers ( insets in figs .",
    "[ fig : n - collapse ] and [ fig : c - collapse ] ) @xmath24 with the exponents @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the exponents @xmath27 and @xmath28 approximately agree with the exponents obtained in @xcite by the calculation of the mean values using the stationary distribution @xmath29 . both crossover times",
    "also fulfil power - law @xmath30 the exponents are @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( insets in figs .",
    "[ fig : n - collapse ] and [ fig : c - collapse ] ) .",
    "the behaviour for @xmath33 is different .",
    "there is no saturation for @xmath33 on the scale of our simulations and the model is critical @xcite .",
    "this scaling behaviour is similar to the well known dynamic scaling for kinetic roughening during surface growth @xcite .",
    "data for @xmath34 as well as for @xmath35 can be rescaled to a single curve ( figs .",
    "[ fig : n - collapse ] and [ fig : c - collapse ] ) .",
    "hence , both @xmath16 and @xmath17 fulfil the following scaling relations @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two different scaling functions with properties : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath40 , @xmath44 , @xmath42 .",
    "exponents @xmath45 , @xmath27 , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 , @xmath28 , @xmath48 ) are not independent but obey the relation @xmath45@xmath49@xmath50 ( @xmath47@xmath49@xmath51 ) ( for reviews on kinetic roughening see @xcite ) .",
    "the relations between exponents are well satisfied for the above obtained values .",
    "if @xmath52 then more and more isolated nodes will be generated .",
    "the above rules do not allow to connect an isolated node to any other node .",
    "it will remain isolated forever",
    ". this may be the unrealistic situation .",
    "one rather expects that isolated nodes can be with a certain probability reconnected . in this case",
    "an additional rule for reconnection would be needed , e.g. , based on the list of links of extinct nodes .",
    "this would imply the need of complicated book - keeping . in order to assess the effect of singular extinctions , we use a different variant of the model which allows to avoid the above unrealistic situation .",
    "we suppose that nodes are now living on a regular lattice .",
    "it means that only some sites of the given lattice are occupied by nodes at the given time .",
    "the occupation may change during evolution .",
    "the lattice sites can represent the different positions in the euclidean space or in some abstract space .",
    "the extremal dynamic is again emploied , nodes are added or removed using the rule _ ( ii)_. however , a node can speciate only if there is an unoccupied site in the neighbourhood of the selected extremal node .",
    "a new `` daughter '' node is placed on a randomly selected unoccupied site within the neighbourhood .",
    "the structure of links of the `` daughter '' node is now not inherited but it is automatically given by existing nodes in her neighbourhood .",
    "the links are established from a given node to all neighbouring nodes ( occupied sites within a given neighbourhood ) .",
    "hence , the above rule _",
    "( iv ) _ does not apply and is replaced be automatic connection within the given neighbourhood .",
    "the network is formed by clusters of connected nodes on the lattice .",
    "all links of an extinct node are broken .",
    "we apply the rule _ ( vi ) _ for singular extinction with @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , isolated nodes can be created and can be reconnected .",
    "the rules also allow reconnection of previously disconnected clusters .",
    "the lattice variant of the model has similar self - organization properties as the above described off - lattice variant .",
    "in particular , it exhibits power - law in the distribution of forward avalanches @xcite .",
    "we consider for simplicity in the following the simple square lattice of the size @xmath54 with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the size @xmath55 has been chosen so large that the finite size effects have no influence ( @xmath55 = 40160 depending on @xmath7 ) .",
    "we performed simulations for two definition of the neighbourhood .",
    "the neighbourhood composed of 4 nearest neighbours ( 4n - model ) and 4 nearest neighbours plus 4 next nearest neighbours ( 8n - model ) .",
    "we found that the time behaviour of the network size and the averaged mean connectivity is qualitatively the same as in the off - lattice model .",
    "both quantities are fluctuating , however , after averaging ( over 1000 or more independent runs ) two regimes can be clearly seen : the initial power - law increase and the saturation at the late times .",
    "the time evolution of network size for two modifications with 4 and 8 neighbours is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nevollat ] . the initial power - law increase @xmath56 with exponent @xmath57 is observed in both cases . @xmath58",
    "increases with decreasing @xmath7 .",
    "saturated values are substantially lower for 4n - model than for 8n - model .",
    "the dependence of saturated values and times of saturation on @xmath7 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : nsatlat ] .",
    "there are again power - laws with more or less the same exponents for both considered neighbourhoods .",
    "similarly as above , we define an analog of the correlation length @xmath59 then we have @xmath60 with the exponents @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the relation @xmath45@xmath49@xmath50 is well satisfied .",
    "we show the corresponding data collapse supporting the scaling relation @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n - collapse2 ] .",
    "when @xmath64 the network grows until the evolution will be affected by the given finite lattice size .",
    "due to low maximal possible value , the connectivity saturates very soon and good scaling of connectivity with @xmath7 has not been obtained .",
    "therefore , data for time evolution of connectivity are not presented . in order to study carefully scaling of connectivity in the lattice model",
    ", one should consider a larger size of neighbourhood - include also more distant sites or consider model on the hypercube .    an external condition limiting the size of the network or the connectivity will lead trivially to the saturation of these quantities .",
    "one expects that there will be scaling with the limiting value .",
    "we verified that indeed there is dynamic scaling of the form @xmath65 with the time and the external parameter @xmath55 . here",
    ", @xmath66 is again scaling function with the properties : @xmath67 for @xmath40 @xmath66@xmath68@xmath69 for @xmath70@xmath71@xmath72 . in the case of 4n - model , we measured the exponents @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 fulfilling well the relation @xmath45@xmath49@xmath50 .",
    "we have studied the time dependence of global characteristics of evolving random networks .",
    "we used the network model with the extremal dynamics and with the variable rules for evolution of the local geometry .",
    "we have found that the averaged network size and the averaged mean connectivity exhibit dynamic scaling with time and with the parameter controlling the form of dynamical rules which in turn affects spreading of the correlations during evolution .",
    "we considered two different variant of the model : the off - lattice variant with the varying reproduction of the local topology and the lattice variant with the variable amount of removal of isolated nodes .",
    "we have found that dynamic scaling is fulfiled in both variants of the model . however , the measured exponents are different .",
    "we attribute this variance to the difference in mechanisms of evolution . on the other hand",
    ", we verified that there are universal features .",
    "the exponents in the lattice variant are robust to the change of the size of neighbourhood .",
    "we expect that dynamic scaling can be observed also in other models of evolving networks with the tunable internal dynamics .",
    "in general , dynamic scaling of evolving networks can be characterized by four independent exponents , two for the time dependence of the averaged size , and two for the evolution of the averaged mean connectivity .",
    "the exponents for evolution of the network size may be trivial or not defined in models in which the number of nodes is only and permanently increasing .",
    "nevertheless , the connectivity may saturate and exhibit nontrivial scaling .",
    "varying the external parameters like the maximal size leads to a qualitatively different scaling .",
    "we believe that the study of dynamic scaling of evolving networks might provide a clue to identification of universal features of network evolution .",
    "it is an open question if dynamic scaling will allow the classification of types of network evolution into different universal classes as in the case of the surface growth , or if evolution of global characteristics turns to be unique for each individual network as it has been found for exponents describing the distribution of connectivities in scale free networks ."
