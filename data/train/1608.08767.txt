    "a narrow - linewidth distributed feedback ( dfb ) laser at 1550 nm is divided into two arms - data and write@xmath10read arm - where the data pulse is frequency up - shifted by the brillouin frequency shift @xmath6 via a single - sideband modulator .",
    "the pulses are imprinted by two intensity modulators connected to a short - pulse generator .",
    "the write@xmath10read pulses are amplified by an erbium doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) . the amplified write and read pulses",
    "pass through a nonlinear fiber loop .",
    "the loop has two effects : firstly it allows only the pulses to be transmitted and efficiently suppresses any noise or coherent background present from the laser or amplifier respectively .",
    "secondly , it improves the pulse shape by smoothing the edges of the pulses .",
    "after the loop a second edfa amplifies the pulses again to reach the necessary peak power of several watts .",
    "bandpass filters ( bandwidth 0.5 nm ) are used in both arms to minimize the white noise from the edfas . both paths",
    "lead to opposite sides of the photonic chip .",
    "the original and retrieved data pulses are observed by a 12ghz photodiode connected to the oscilloscope . before the photodiode",
    "a tunable narrowband filter is used to assure that only the data pulses reach the photodetector .      for the detection of different optical phases we use a homodyne detection scheme . a local oscillator ( continuous wave ) at the wavelength of the data pulses interferes at a 50:50 coupler with the original and retrieved data pulses .",
    "the beat signal is sent to a polarization beam splitter both output signals of which are connected to a balanced photodetector . the polarization of the local oscillator and the data pulses are controlled such that the difference signal of both photodiodes of the balanced photodetector is maximized in order to distinguish the two phases , shifted by @xmath4 .      as a storage medium",
    "we use a photonic chip made out of the chalcogenide glass @xmath3 .",
    "we use a rib waveguide structure with a cross - section of 2.2 @xmath11 m by 800 nm and a total length of 46 cm . for details on the fabrication methods of the chip",
    "we refer to reference @xcite . lensed fiber tips are used to couple light in and out of the waveguides .",
    "the chalcogenide glass is sandwiched between a silica substrate and a silica over cladding .",
    "this not only provides guidance of the optical mode due to a contrast in the refractive index but importantly provides also an acoustic impedance mismatch between the soft chalcogenide glass ( @xmath12=2600 m/s ) and the stiff silica @xmath12=5996 m/s .",
    "this leads to guidance of the optical and the acoustic wave in the chalcogenide glass and hence provides a large opto - acoustic overlap .",
    "ultra - high brillouin gain of up to 50db amplification of a small cw seed for a moderate cw pump power of 300mw was achieved .",

    "a continuous wave ( cw ) narrow - linewidth distributed feedback ( dfb ) laser at 1550 nm is divided into a data and write@xmath10read arm by a 50/50 fiber coupler .",
    "the data pulses are frequency up - shifted by the brillouin frequency shift @xmath13  ghz via a single - sideband modulator .",
    "the cw laser signal is carved into pulses by two intensity modulators connected to a short - pulse generator , allowing the generation of pulses with different amplitude levels and phase states .",
    "the pulses are amplified using erbium doped fiber amplifiers ( edfa ) and sub - sequentially filtered by narrow bandwidth ( 0.5 nm ) bandpass filters to reduce the effect of broadband white noise introduced by the amplification step . additionally to the passive bandpass filter a nonlinear fiber loop",
    "is implemented in the write and read arm .",
    "the loop consists of 1 km standard single mode fiber , a polarization controller and a 50/50 coupler to introduce some asymmetry in the two paths .",
    "this fiber loop is used for two reasons : firstly it allows only the pulses to be transmitted and efficiently suppresses any noise or coherent background present from the laser or amplifier respectively .",

    "a second edfa amplifies the pulses again to reach the necessary peak power of several watts . both paths",
    "lead to opposite sides of the photonic chip and are coupled to the waveguide using lensed fibers .",
    "two different detection schemes are used to detect the transmitted and retrieved data pulses : direct detection with a single photodiode is used for the amplitude retrieval whereas a homodyne detection scheme is used for the phase measurements . for the direct detection scheme a 12ghz photodiode connected to the oscilloscope is used . for the homodyne detection scheme a local oscillator ( continuous wave ) at the wavelength of the data pulses",
    "interferes at a 50:50 coupler with the original and retrieved data pulses .",
    "the beat signal is sent to a polarization beam splitter both output signals of which are connected to a balanced photodetector . the polarization of the local oscillator and the data pulses are controlled such that the difference signal of both photodiodes of the balanced photodetector is maximized in order to distinguish the two phases , shifted by @xmath4 . in both detection schemes a tunable narrow - band filter ( @xmath14  ghz )",
    "is used to assure that only the data pulses reach the photodetector .",
    "we analyzed the storage time of the phonon memory and compared it with a standard pump probe measurement of the brillouin linewidth .",
    "figure [ dec]a ) shows different readout pulses for different storage times up to 10.5ns .",
    "for increasing storage times the readout efficiency decreases due to the decaying amplitude of the acoustic wave .",
    "the area of the retrieved pulses is integrated to determine the acoustic decay time ( figure [ dec]b ) .",
    "the exponential decrease of the pulse areas are plotted in figure [ dec]c ) and an exponential fit @xmath15 reveals an acoustic decay time of 10.2ns .",
    "we confirm the acoustic decay time by measuring the linewidth of the brillouin gain response ( figure [ dec]c ) .",
    "a modified version of the set - up in figure [ set ] is used to execute the cw pump probe measurements .",
    "the intensity modulators were removed and the ssb modulator is frequency swept by the rf output of a vector network analyzer ( vna ) to generate a seed signal .",
    "the transmitted seed signal is detected by a photodiode connected to the vna and the brillouin response for different pump powers is measured .",
    "the brillouin gain linewidth @xmath16 relates to the acoustic decay time @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "the fit in figure [ dec]c ) shows a linewidth of 30mhz for 21dbm pump power , which agrees perfectly with the 10.2ns decay time measured in the storage experiment .",
    "as expected the linewidth of the gain peak decreases above the brillouin threshold ( inset figure [ dec]d ) .",
    "+ the great agreement of the two measurement techniques not only confirms the consistency of the light storage measurements , but also suggests itself for using the storage technique to _ locally _ access material and structure specific acoustic decay times . whereas cw based pump probe schemes only provide an average of the acoustic decay time over the whole length of the waveguide , the pulsed measurement determines the acoustic decay time at the point of the waveguide where the pulses overlap .",
    "the overlap can be scanned along the waveguide providing spatial information about the waveguide .",
    "+      the readout efficiency could be increased to 32% after 3.5ns storage time as shown in figure [ rec ] .",
    "it is known from numerical studies that the amplitude of the retrieved pulses can be enhanced by using chirped pulses @xcite .",
    "this can greatly enhance the performance of the phononic buffer for simple on - off data streams , where one is only interested in retrieving the amplitude . in this case",
    "it also could increase the maximum retrieval time of the buffer by lifting the retrieved amplitude above the noise floor .",
    "the 32% readout depicted in figure [ rec ] is achieved by increasing the input power into the nonlinear loop ( see set - up figure [ set ] ) .",
    "higher input power increases the nonlinear process known as self phase modulation , chirping the pulses @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear loop in the set - up therefore not only reduces the noise , but also allows for a more efficient readout amplitude through compression of the retrieved pulse",
    ". however the pulse shape is not maintained in this case .",
    "besides using chirped pulses to improve the maximum retrieval amplitude , it was also shown theoretically that small amounts of chirp help to more efficiently excite the acoustic wave @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by drawing an analogy to the mccall and hahn area theorem for atomic two - level system @xcite .",
    "analogues to the @xmath4 pulse in atomic resonances , a normalized `` pulse area '' of the write pulses can be defined and is given by @xcite @xmath19 , with the brillouin gain coefficient @xmath20 , the speed of light @xmath21 , the effective mode area @xmath22 , the acoustic decay time @xmath23 , the refractive index @xmath24 and the time integral over the pulse envelope @xmath25 .",
    "the maximum efficiency for exciting the acoustic wave is achieved when @xmath26 with @xmath27 being an integer number .",
    "however the data pulse can not be transferred to the acoustic wave if the `` pulse area '' is an integer multiple of @xmath4 .",
    "if the pulse area is a multiple of @xmath4 the first half of the pulse will write the acoustic wave , while the second half retrieves it again . however , for a linear chirped pulse the beginning of the pulse has a different frequency as the end of the pulse .",
    "therefore , only a certain part of the pulse resonantly excites the acoustic wave and importantly does not de - excite the acoustic wave ."

    "<S> coherent phonons , however , can also be directly excited by optical photons through strong acousto - optic coupling in integrated circuits that guide photons as well as phonons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these hypersound phonons have similar wavelength as the exciting optical field but travel at a 5-orders of magnitude lower velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the realization of a coherent optical buffer , a long time desired yet elusive device for on - chip optical signal processing . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a coherent on - chip memory storing the entire coherent information carried by light , phase and amplitude , as acoustic phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the photonic - phononic memory provides ghz - bandwidth enabled by the ultra - strong opto - acoustic interaction of the photonic chip and operates at all wavelengths in the transparency window of the glass medium .    an all - optical memory or buffer is an important building block for next generation signal processing and computing architectures allowing for the replacement of the electrical interconnects with photonic links between multiple processors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> photonic links have great advantages concerning energy consumption and capacity , however the fast speed of photons also imposes challenges when it comes to manipulating , synchronizing and routing optical signals on chip length - scales . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a flexible dynamic optical buffer is required , that takes full advantage of photonics , which means it provides large bandwidth , is compatible with wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) , preserves the coherence of the optical signal and requires low energy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore chip integration is required to be compatible with electrical microchips , which are scalable , low cost to manufacture and exhibit an overall small footprint . </S>",
    "<S> being such a paramount device , significant research efforts were undertaken to realize optical buffers based on different approaches , such as optical resonators @xcite , photonic crystal cavities @xcite , quantum wells @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , slow lights systems @xcite , nanomechanical resonators @xcite or phase - change materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although impressive results have been obtained , none of the demonstrations so far fulfilled all the above criteria . </S>",
    "<S> some approaches suffer from a narrow bandwidth and fixed storage times @xcite , others do not preserve the phase of the optical signal @xcite , still others add distortion @xcite while some are difficult to implement at room temperature into an integrated device @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach is to harness acoustic phonons to coherently transfer the information of the optical signal to the acoustic domain @xcite where it travels 5 orders of magnitude slower than in the optical domain and does not suffer from effects of optical dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> therefore our approach is fundamentally different from sbs based slow light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> transferring the signal back to the optical domain leads to a delay of the optical signal by approximately the time the signal was encoded as acoustic wave . </S>",
    "<S> we use stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) - one of the strongest nonlinear effects - to coherently couple two optical waves and an acoustic wave . </S>",
    "<S> the optical data signal is transferred to the acoustic wave by a strong counter - propagating optical write signal . using this nonlinear effect as a memory </S>",
    "<S> was first proposed in highly nonlinear fiber @xcite , however , so far solely the storage of one amplitude level of several nano - second long pulses was shown @xcite , which represents only a fraction of the capability this memory concept can offer . </S>",
    "<S> acoustic storage relies on the coherent transfer of the optical information to the acoustic wave and vice - versa and therefore phase and amplitude do not suffer from distortion . </S>",
    "<S> a recent paradigm shift in sbs research from long lengths of optical fiber to chip - scale devices , enables tailoring and enhancing the optoacoustic interaction strength by several orders of magnitude @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we exploit this ultra - strong local interaction in a highly nonlinear waveguide to demonstrate for the first time storage of several bits with sub - ns pulse - width corresponding to a broad ghz bandwidth , retrieval of the phase and amplitude information and multi - wavelength operation . given the long acoustic lifetime compared to the short optical data pulses , this memory concept allows continuously adjustable storage time over several pulse widths . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated optoacoustic waveguides can be interfaced with other on - chip components and furthermore greatly reduces the required peak power to excite the coherent acoustic phonons .    </S>",
    "<S> the method to write and retrieve the optical data pulses as acoustic phonons is schematically shown in figure [ princ]a ) and [ princ]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a strong write pulse @xmath0 , offset by the acoustic resonance frequency of the optical waveguide material , counter - propagates the optical data pulse @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> when the two pulses encounter each other , the beat pattern between the two compresses the material periodically through a process known as electrostriction , exciting resonantly and locally a coherent acoustic phonon @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the required power depends on the local brillouin gain , which is orders of magnitude higher in chalcogenide @xmath3 rib waveguides than , for example , in standard silica fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the optical as well as the acoustic mode are guided in the rib waveguide structure through a contrast in the refractive index and the acoustic impedance between the chalcogenide glass and the silica surrounding , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> after being transferred to the acoustic wave the optical data pulses can be retrieved after a storage time of several nanoseconds corresponding to several tens of pulse widths of the data pulse . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ result]a ) shows the depletion of the optical data pulse with increasing counter - propagating write pulse power ( storing process ) . due to the ultra strong brillouin gain in chalcogenide waveguides , </S>",
    "<S> the depletion reaches over 90% with 20-fold </S>",
    "<S> lower write pulse peak power than in highly nonlinear fiber approaches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the storage and subsequent retrieval of the optical data pulses is demonstrated in figure [ result]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the storage time can be continuously adjusted by simply controlling the time difference between the read and the write pulses and a readout efficiency of 15% to 32% after 3.5ns can be achieved ( see supplementary ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of figure [ result]b ) shows a zoomed - in version of 4 examples of retrieved data pulses after different storage times . from the exponential decrease of the retrieval efficiency an acoustic decay time of 10.5ns </S>",
    "<S> is measured using an exponential fit and is confirmed by a pump - probe measurement of the brillouin gain linewidth ( see supplementary material ) . in order to study the retrieval of the pulse shape , we superimpose the normalized original data pulse with two normalized retrieved data pulses , displayed in figure [ result]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the shape of the optical data pulse is maintained during the storage process indicating that the bandwidth of the photonic - phononic memory is large enough to resolve even small features , such as the peak at the beginning of the optical data pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic brillouin linewidth is only in the range of tens of mhz , however due to the strong opto - acoustic coupling in the photonic - phononic waveguides the brillouin response can be broadened to several ghz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the capacity of the memory can be even further increased by encoding different amplitude levels , different wavelengths and importantly also the phase of the optical signal . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the here demonstrated optical buffer fully compatible with advanced optical communication schemes . </S>",
    "<S> the retrieval of the amplitude and phase information for two short optical pulses with 500ps pulse width after 3.5ns is shown in [ result2]a and b. the pulse width corresponds to a broad bandwidth of more than 1.5ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we encoded 6 different amplitude levels in pulse 1 , while maintaining the amplitude level of a 2nd data pulse constant as a reference . </S>",

    "<S> was theoretically predicted @xcite . to distinguish the phase we replace the direct detection scheme ( single photodiode ) with an interferometric homodyne detection scheme . here , the phase encoded signal interferes with a local oscillator and is detected by a balanced detector measuring the difference signal of two equal photodiodes .        </S>",
    "<S> two pulses are encoded with two different phases , either 0 and @xmath4 ( blue ) or @xmath4 and 0 ( red ) , respectively ( [ result2]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> after being stored 3.5ns , these same values can be read out ( light blue and orange ) and are clearly distinguishable . for a better understanding , </S>",
    "<S> the states in the phase space ( i - q diagram ) are related to the optical pulses . for phase 0 , the local oscillator and the data pulses interfere constructively , resulting in a positive value , for @xmath4 they interfere destructively which results in a negative pulse on the balanced detector . </S>",
    "<S> the phase retrieval is possible due to the coherence of the brillouin process and proves its potential as a coherent buffer . </S>",
    "<S> note , that this feature can be implemented for any phase in the entire phase space and not only 0 and @xmath4 . to demonstrate the wavelength multiplexing capacity </S>",
    "<S> , we adjusted the operation laser wavelength to 3 different values in the tuning range of our laser . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen from figure [ result2]c ) that the same efficiency is achieved for all wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the store and read - out process is strictly bound to specific wavelength conditions , such that the process is operational at different wavelengths at the same time . </S>",
