    "consider next the @xmath62 anomaly , equation  . from the index theorem",
    ", it vanishes if @xmath63 the sum ` @xmath64 ' indicates a plain summation over all fermions .    in summary , we see that the continuous symmetries are non - anomalous if and only if the jacobian   is trivial for arbitrary @xmath27 .      now consider a discrete symmetry , i.e.  @xmath43 where , by convention , @xmath66 takes only the discrete values @xmath67 and the eigenvalues of @xmath41 are integer .",
    "like before , we demand that @xmath50 be trivial .",
    "it is now important to note that the jacobian can also be trivial for non - zero arguments of the exponential .",
    "let us specify the conditions for this to happen .",
    "consider first the abelian case , i.e.  a @xmath11 symmetry with @xmath68 . from the gauge and gravitational parts of the anomaly function , equations   and  , and the index theorems  , we see that the jacobian is trivial if    @xmath69    the factor 2 in front of the dynkin index in is due to our conventions ( @xmath46=\\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ab}$ ] ) .",
    "this means that the constraints for a @xmath11 symmetry to be anomaly - free are    [ eq : znconditions ] @xmath70    if @xmath14 is odd , we can always make the @xmath11 charges even by shifting them by integer multiples of @xmath14 .",
    "this explains why the sums in and can always be made integer .",
    "hence in the case of an odd @xmath14 one can replace @xmath71 by @xmath14 after a suitable shift of the charges . the constraints and coincide with the ones of the literature @xcite . we would like to emphasize that , in our derivation , we did not invoke the contributions from heavy majorana fermions .",

    "their contribution to the sum is @xmath71 , on the other hand the majorana mass term @xmath73 is allowed by the discrete symmetry .",
    "since @xmath34 can be arbitrarily large , @xmath72 can be ` removed from the theory ' . while the argument leads to the correct result",
    ", one might nevertheless wonder if the anomaly conditions change if one considers more constrained settings ( such as string - derived theories ) where extra degrees of freedom can not be introduced at will .",
    "our derivation shows that the anomaly conditions remain unchanged . ]",
    "rather , the anomaly constraints ( including the condition mod@xmath74 ) are a consequence of the index theorems and follow from demanding that the jacobian be trivial .",
    "we also note that in our approach one immediately sees that there are no cubic anomaly constraints for discrete symmetries , which is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we now turn to non - abelian discrete symmetries @xmath75 .",
    "consider a specific transformation @xmath76 . since we are considering a discrete symmetry",
    ", there is a positive integer @xmath14 such that @xmath77 , i.e.  @xmath76 is generating a @xmath11 symmetry ; we take @xmath14 to be the smallest such integer .",
    "denote the ( discrete ) representations of @xmath75 by @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , an element @xmath79 in a representation @xmath78 is given by @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 having integer eigenvalues . in the evaluation of the anomaly functions , equations   and",

    "we find that demanding that the jacobian be trivial amounts to requiring    [ eq : nonabeliandiscreteanomalyconstraints1 ] @xmath87    where the sum ` @xmath88 ' indicates that only over representations is summed which are non - trivial w.r.t.both @xmath45 and @xmath75 ; the symbol ` @xmath89 ' in means that the sum extends over all non - trivial representations @xmath78 .",
    "these constraints have to be fulfilled for each discrete transformation @xmath76 separately .",

    "it is then obvious that this implies that for both elements @xmath92 and @xmath93 equations hold as well .",

    "[ app : d4 ] , we discuss @xmath1 anomalies as an example for non - abelian discrete anomalies . in appendix [ app : grimuslavoura ]",
    "we present a sample calculation .",
    "the anomaly constraints for discrete symmetries can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "anomalies of @xmath11 symmetries + [ eq : znanomalyconstraints ] @xmath94 2 .",
    "anomalies of non - abelian discrete symmetries @xmath75 : one has to verify that for all generators of @xmath75 the following two equations hold + [ eq : nonabeliananomalyconstraints ] @xmath95 + here , the sum @xmath89 extends over all non - trivial representations of @xmath75 , @xmath84 is defined in equation , and @xmath14 denotes the order of the generator .",
    "now we turn to study the implications of an anomalous discrete symmetry .",
    "one might envisage several scenarios in which such a symmetry appears .",
    "in what follows , we focus on a particular one : we start with a so - called ` anomalous ' 1 and break it to a discrete subgroup . later , in section",
    "[ sec : orbifoldanomalies ] , where we investigate string - derived models , we will attempt to realize different situations .    in a fundamental theory ,",
    "anomalies of a continuous symmetry are not acceptable",
    ". however , there is the well - understood situation in which a 1 factor appears ` anomalous ' , i.e.  the usual anomaly conditions seem not to be satisfied .",
    "this is the case when the anomaly is canceled by the green - schwarz ( gs ) mechanism @xcite . to discuss this scenario ,",
    "consider a supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "under the ( ` anomalous ' ) @xmath96 transformation , the chiral superfields @xmath97 containing the chiral fermions @xmath98 and the vector superfield @xmath99 transform as @xmath100 the anomaly is canceled by the transformation of the dilaton @xmath101 ( or possibly a different chiral field ) , which gets shifted under the @xmath96 transformation as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is proportional to the trace of the generator of @xmath96 , @xmath104 , ( see below ) .",
    "the tree - level khler potential for the dilaton is @xmath105 as usual , the kinetic terms for the scalar components of @xmath101 arise from the corresponding @xmath75-term , @xmath106_d$ ] , i.e. @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "consider now the axionic shift , @xmath110 the kinetic term is invariant under this shift when @xmath111 is constant .",
    "however , as the parameter @xmath111 depends on @xmath112 for @xmath96 transformations , the kinetic term   is not invariant under @xmath96 . to make it invariant",
    ", we have to introduce the terms , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , in the stckelberg form .",
    "that implies the @xmath96-invariant khler potential for the dilaton is @xmath115 which also includes the @xmath116-dependent fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) d - term .",
    "it is convenient to define a normalized @xmath96 generator @xmath117 , whose charges @xmath118 fulfill the consistency conditions ( cf.@xcite ) @xmath119 our conventions are such that @xmath103 is positive .",
    "( as before , @xmath64 means plain summation . ) the mixed @xmath120 anomaly coefficients , as defined in , have to satisfy the consistency conditions @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the ka - moody level of @xmath45 .",
    "for the green - schwarz mechanism to work , this relation has to hold for all gauge group factors .",
    "the first question is whether @xmath96 can be used to forbid couplings . to answer this question ,",
    "consider a product of fields , @xmath123 , with @xmath124 . in the case of a usual 1 symmetry",
    ", @xmath123 can not denote an allowed coupling .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath96 , this conclusion does not apply ; instead one finds that the non - perturbative coupling @xmath125 with an appropriate @xmath126 can be induced ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "the field @xmath127 transforms under the 1 with a charge that is opposite to @xmath128 .",
    "that means that @xmath96 does not forbid products of fields with @xmath124 .",
    "what can one say about products of fields @xmath123 with @xmath129 ? here the answer is that an anomalous 1 implies the existence of a fi @xmath75-term ( cf . equation  ) . to obtain a supersymmetric vacuum",
    ", the fi term has to be canceled .",
    "that is , certain fields with net negative anomalous charge have to attain a vev in the vacuum .",
    "multiplication of @xmath123 by such fields can lead to allowed couplings , hence in supersymmetric vacua couplings of the type @xmath123 will generically be allowed .",
    "given these considerations , it is also clear what happens if one breaks @xmath96 to a discrete , anomalous subgroup .",
    "since @xmath96 is violated by terms of the form , also the discrete subgroup is expected not to be exact .",
    "gets broken to a @xmath11 subgroup which , however , is non - anomalous by the criteria . here , either the terms appear nevertheless , or there is a subclass of terms , which are forbidden by the non - anomalous @xmath11 , and where the coefficient happens to be zero .",
    "that is , if the second possibility is true , non - perturbative effects break @xmath96 to an non - anomalous @xmath11 subgroup . to find out which situation is realized would be , by itself , an interesting question , which is , however , beyond the scope of this study . ]",
    "an anomaly of an abelian discrete symmetry does not necessarily signal an inconsistency of the model .",
    "symmetries might just be accidental or approximate , and , therefore , need not to be gauged .",
    "further , if the anomalies are universal , they can be canceled by a green - schwarz mechanism . in practice",
    ", this means that they are broken by the vevs of certain fields ; in addition there are non - perturbatively induced terms with hierarchically small coefficients , as in .",
    "these small corrections might turn out to be a virtue rather than a problem in concrete models .",
    "we conclude this section by commenting on supersymmetric texture zeros @xcite , which go sometimes also under the term ` susy zero mechanism ' .",
    "it is stated that , due to holomorphicity of the superpotential , an anomalous 1 symmetry can enforce absence of certain couplings even though the symmetry is broken in supersymmetric vacua , where the fi @xmath75-term is canceled .",
    "let us briefly review the argument : cancellation of the fi term requires certain field with certain , say negative , sign of ` anomalous ' charge to attain a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "now one might envisage a situation in which only fields with non - positive charges get a vev .",
    "consider then a combination of some other fields , @xmath123 , which has total negative anomalous charge . to be neutral w.r.t .  the @xmath96 symmetry",
    ", this combination needs to be multiplied by fields with positive @xmath96 charge .",
    "however , so the argument goes , those fields do not attain vevs , and hence @xmath123 can not denote an allowed coupling .",
    "that is , couplings of the type @xmath123 appear to be absent . on the other hand , in many applications of the ` susy zero mechanism ' it is not possible to specify a symmetry that forbids those couplings .",
    "with what we have discussed above , we are able to resolve the puzzle : @xmath127 carries positive charge and hence couplings of the form @xmath130 can arise .",
    "the induced effective coupling is suppressed ( so that , as far as textures are concerned , a ` zero ' can be a good approximation ) , however , in contrast to what is often assumed , in general it is not related to the scale of supersymmetry breakdown .",
    "an interesting question is whether discrete anomalies occur in top - down constructions , in particular in string compactifications @xcite . since string theory",
    "is believed to be uv complete , one would expect that there are no ( uncanceled ) anomalies in this framework . while this has been extensively checked for continuous gauge symmetries , the case of discrete symmetries",
    "is somewhat more subtle .",
    "construction of string models exhibiting discrete anomalies would lead to a playground in which the ` quantum gravity effects ' , which are commonly believed to spoil the discrete conservation laws , can be specified in somewhat more detail than usual .",
    "specifically , we study anomalies of discrete symmetries in heterotic orbifold models . in our presentation",
    ", we mainly focus on the 6-ii orbifold , yet in our computations we also considered different orbifolds , so that our results are more generally valid .",
    "we start with a very brief review on orbifolds , summarize the essentials of ( discrete ) string selection rules , continue by relating the so - called ` anomalous 1 ' to a discrete transformation in compact space , which we refer to as the ` anomalous space group element @xmath131 ' , and conclude by relating anomalies in discrete symmetries to the anomaly in the discrete transformation @xmath131 .",
    "a heterotic orbifold emerges by dividing a six - dimensional torus @xmath132 by one of its symmetries @xmath111 @xcite ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "@xmath132 can be parametrized by three complex coordinates @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "then we denote @xmath135 .",
    "for example , in 6-ii orbifolds one has @xmath136 .",
    "a model is defined by the compactification lattice , the twist vector @xmath137 , the shift @xmath99 and the wilson lines @xmath138 . given these data , the massless spectrum ( at the orbifold point ) is completely determined ( for recent explicit examples see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a rather common feature of these constructions is the occurrence of a so - called ` anomalous 1 ' , @xmath96 ,  @xcite ( cf.section  [ sec : discreteanomalies ] ) , which implies that , at one - loop , a fi @xmath75-term is induced  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the ` anomalous ' 1 plays a prominent role in the discussion of discrete anomalies .",
    "couplings on heterotic orbifolds are governed by certain selection rules @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , some of which can be interpreted as discrete symmetries of the effective field theory emerging as ` low - energy ' limit in these constructions .",

    "in contrast , cancellation of non - universal @xmath167-duality anomalies requires additionally threshold corrections . according to  @xcite , in orbifold models the anomaly associated to the modulus @xmath168 is non - universal only if any of the orbifold twists acts trivially on the corresponding @xmath159 complex plane of the underlying six - torus .",
    "this means in particular , that for 6-ii orbifolds the anomalies of @xmath171 and @xmath172 are non - universal and therefore the associated moduli appear in the threshold corrections .",
    "further , since the orbifold twist acts non - trivially on the first complex plane , the @xmath170-anomaly must be universal to be completely canceled by the green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "we have conducted a scan over @xmath167-anomaly in 6-ii orbifold models , and confirm that only the @xmath170-anomalies are universal ( for our conventions for labeling the two - tori see  @xcite ) . however , this does not imply that there are uncanceled @xmath167-anomalies in the other tori .",

    "note that a superpotential term @xmath207 has to transform trivially both for the anomalous @xmath96 and anomalous discrete symmetries .",
    "furthermore , anomaly cancellation by the green - schwarz mechanism requires that discrete anomalies be universal for different gauge group up to modulo the structure .",
    "we will examine the universality conditions for discrete anomalies in section [ sec : survey ] .",

    "at first sight , one might think that the @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 rules in 6-ii orbifolds entail @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 symmetries , respectively . however , it is obvious that , once the @xmath122-rule is satisfied , the discrete @xmath139 symmetries boil down to @xmath219 discrete symmetries .",

    "in other words , there are no ` anomalous - looking ' unbroken 1 factors .",
    "the requirement of keeping the @xmath75-terms of the other symmetries zero leads typically to a situation in which more than one field attains a vev and in which the various vevs are related .",

    "one may wonder if one could break @xmath96 by canceling the fi term as usual while leaving the anomalous flavor symmetries intact .",
    "we have tried to do this in a large set of models with ` anomalous ' 1 ( including the models presented in @xcite ) , i.e.  we searched for gauge invariant monomials with net negative charge under @xmath96 whose constituents transform trivially under the anomalous discrete symmetries . in most models",
    "it is hard , if not impossible , to find such a monomial . in other words , according to what we find , the requirement of keeping supersymmetry unbroken forces one not only to break the ` anomalous ' 1 , as is well known , but generically also implies that ` anomalous ' discrete symmetries get broken ( which is somewhat surprising because they do of course not have a @xmath75-term ) .",
    "however , in a couple of models we did find a monomial whose constituents transform trivially under some of the anomalous discrete symmetries . in these models ,",
    "an anomalous @xmath272 subgroup of the original @xmath222 remains unbroken .",
    "we posted the details of the model at a web site @xcite .",

    "we have used the path integral approach to derive anomaly constraints for non - abelian discrete symmetries ; the constraints are given in equation .",
    "in the second part of the study , we have explored discrete anomalies in string - derived models , focusing on heterotic orbifolds .",
    "we find that discrete anomalies can only occur if there is an ` anomalous ' 1 .",

    "all other anomalies , such as @xmath232-anomalies and @xmath167-duality anomalies , derive from these basic anomalies .",
    "the coefficients of the basic anomalies are connected to an anomalous space group element , whose gauge embedding arises from the generator of the anomalous 1. we find that the basic anomalies are always universal , such that they might be canceled by the same green - schwarz mechanism that cancels the 1 anomaly .",
    "we have also searched for models where the ` anomalous ' 1 symmetry can be broken ( i.e.  the fi term can be canceled ) without breaking the ` anomalous ' discrete symmetries .",
    "while it is hard to find a model with these properties , we could find a few examples in which an anomalous @xmath272 symmetry survives .",
    "the implication of these anomalous @xmath272 symmetries will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "of course , discrete and continuous symmetries that are broken by a suppressed vev , as is the case in the ` anomalous ' 1 , are known to be a useful tool in model building .",
    "indeed , our results indicate that in string models discrete cousins of ` anomalous ' 1 symmetries are frequently present , whereby , according to what we find , cancellation of the fi term triggers symmetry breakdown .",
