    "different telescopes have observed very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - rays coming from the galactic center ( gc ) , such as cangaroo @xcite , veritas @xcite , magic @xcite or fermi - lat @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will pay attention to the data collected by the hess collaboration from the j1745 - 290 source during the years 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 @xcite .",
    "the variability of the ir and x - ray observations @xcite indicates a different emission mechanism for this part of the spectrum .",
    "in addition , one of the most characteristic features of the hess j1745 - 290 data consists in a cut - off at several tens of tevs .",
    "these spectral properties can be explained naturally by the photons produced by the annihilation or decay of dark matter ( dm ) particles .",
    "this interpretation was discussed from the very early days of the publication of the hess data @xcite but it was concluded that the dm origin was disfavored @xcite . however , a recent study has shown that the observed data are well fitted as dm signal complemented by a diffuse background @xcite . indeed , this background has a good motivation since vhe photons are also expected from radiative processes generated by particle acceleration in the neighborhood of the supermassive black hole sgr a and the sgr a east supernova .",
    "the analysis shows good agreement with dm annihilation or decay into @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark - antiquark channels and @xmath0 and @xmath7 boson channels .",
    "leptonic and other quark - antiquark channels were excluded with @xmath8 confidence level .",
    "the background provided by the analysis is also compatible with the fermi - lat data from the ifgl j1745.6 - 2900 source observed during 25 months @xcite , which is spatially consistent with the hess j1745 - 290 source @xcite .    in any case",
    ", the fundamental nature of this gamma - ray flux is still unclear .",
    "the entire vhe spectrum may be produced by particle propagation @xcite in the vicinity of the commented supernova remnant and black hole , both located at the central region of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "in addition , the emission region is quite compact since the signal is limited to a region of few tenths of degree @xcite .",
    "this feature is not consistent with dark halos simulated with non - baryonic cold dm , such as the standard nfw profile @xcite .",
    "it needs to be more compact as the ones produced when baryonic effects are taken into account .",
    "it has been argued that the baryonic gas falls to the inner part of the halo , modifying the gravitational potential and increasing the dm density in the center @xcite .",
    "this scenario is not completely accepted ( read @xcite for example ) , but if it is correct , it has two important consequences .",
    "first , the sensitivity of indirect dm searches is reduced to a more compressed region ; and second , the dm annihilating fluxes are enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude with respect to the standard nfw profile @xcite .",
    "the hess observations are in good agreement with these types of compressed dark halos .    the dm particle that originate this spectrum needs to have a mass between @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this makes highly challenging to observe these particles in direct detection experiments or particle accelerators @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "complementary cosmic rays analysis @xcite from the gc and from other astrophysical objects are the most promising way to cross check the commented dm hypotheses . in particular , the analysis of neutrino fluxes from the same region can be determining .",
    "if dm annihilates or decays into standard model ( sm ) particles producing vhe gamma - rays photons , it has to produce also vhe neutrinos . indeed , if the dark halo properties are adjusted to explain the hess j1745 - 290 data , the neutrino flux is completely determined if one concrete annihilation or decay channel is assumed .",
    "this work is organised as follows : in section ii , we study the expected neutrino fluxes as indirect products of annihilating dm in the direction of the gc .",
    "section iii is devoted to discuss the flavor oscillation effects in this signal . in section iv",
    ", we model the background of our analysis by taking into account the atmospheric neutrino flux observed by the icecube experiment and we study the best configuration that may allow the detection of the corresponding neutrino signal associated with the hess j@xmath10-@xmath11 gc gamma - rays source .",
    "finally , we summarize our main conclusions in section v.",
    "the differential flux of neutrinos of a given flavor @xmath12 observed on the earth in a particular direction can be computed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the elements of the symmetric @xmath15 matrix which takes into account the neutrino oscillation effects from the produced neutrino flavor ( @xmath16 ) generated by the dm from galactic sources to the observed neutrino flavor ( @xmath12 ) on the earth .",
    "we shall discuss these effects in detail in the next section .",
    "@xmath17 is the mass of the dm particle .",
    "the case @xmath18 accounts for neutrinos coming from dm annihilation with @xmath19 the thermal averaged annihilation cross - section of two dm particles ( assumed to be their own antiparticles ) into sm particles ( also labeled by the subindex i ) . if dm is meta - stable , neutrinos can be produced also by its decay . in such a case the contribution with @xmath20 is activated with @xmath21 the decay width into sm particles ( labeled by the same subindex @xmath22 ) .",
    "the number of neutrinos of flavor @xmath16 produced in each annihilating or decaying channel @xmath23 , involves decays and/or hadronization of unstable products such as quarks and leptons .",
    "because of the non - perturbative qcd effects , this requires monte carlo events generators @xcite or fitting or interpolation functions @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will use the results reported in @xcite .",
    "they refer to pythia 8.135 monte carlo events generator software @xcite and reproduce the differential number of neutrinos produced by dm of different masses . in this work",
    ", we will focus on neutrino fluxes coming from fragmentation and decays of sm particle - antiparticle pairs produced by dm annihilation .",
    "we shall ignore dm decays , the possible production of mono energetic neutrinos , n - body annihilations ( with @xmath24 ) , or neutrinos produced from electroweak bremsstrahlung . in particular , we will consider dm annihilation into single channels of sm particle - antiparticle pairs that are consistent with the origin of the hess j@xmath10-@xmath11 gamma - ray observations as we have explained .",
    "the dm spatial distribution is encoded in the astrophysical factors @xmath25 , that depend on the @xmath26 angle , determined by the line of observation with respect to the direction of the gc , and the total angular field of view @xmath27 : @xmath28 dl(\\psi)\\ , , \\label{astrofactor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the distance from the sun to a particular point of the dm halo , that is related to the radial distance @xmath30 , computed respect to the gc , through the equation : @xmath31 .",
    "the distance between the sun and the center of the galaxy is denoted by @xmath32 kpc , and the maximum distance between the sun and the edge of the halo in a given direction @xmath26 is @xmath33 .",
    "the differential astrophysical factor is proportional to @xmath34 when it accounts for dm annihilation and proportional to @xmath35 when it computes a dm decay .",
    "as we have commented , the neutrino fluxes have to be averaged over the field of view of the detector , that we shall parameterize with the angle @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "the hess cherenkov telescopes array can be characterized typically by @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "this angular resolution angle is not precise enough to resolve the j@xmath10-@xmath11 gamma - ray morphology , which can be approximated by a point - like source .",
    "therefore , the integration along the line of sight can be approximated by a constant value for @xmath40 and the astrophysical factor given by eq .",
    "( [ astrofactor ] ) is fixed by fitting the hess data :        @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the astrophysical factor which reproduces the j@xmath10-@xmath11 gamma - ray flux , and it depends on the particular annihilating or decaying dm channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a neutrino telescope with @xmath43 the total astrophysical factor ( @xmath44 ) is constant , whereas the average ( @xmath25 ) decreases with @xmath45 inversely . in particular , we will focus on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 annihilation channels with the standard thermal value @xmath46 . by taking into account the results of @xcite : @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "after simulating the neutrino fluxes produced at the source , one has to take into account different aspects in order to estimate the expected flux as observed on the earth , such as neutrino oscillations and detector sensitivity to neutrino flavors . on the other hand , we shall assume that our detector is not able to discriminate between neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "due to neutrino oscillations , the ratio of neutrino flavor changes during the way from the source to the observer @xcite .",
    "by considering the standard three - flavor neutrino oscillation , the probability matrix @xmath49 for astrophysical neutrinos traversing a vast distance is given by : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "for example , for the simplified case of the oscillation between only two flavors at distance @xmath52 by the source , the probability can be written as : @xmath53            it depends by the mixing angle @xmath54 , and the oscillation length @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the energy and @xmath57 is the squared mass difference between the two mass eigenstates . by taking into account",
    "that @xmath58 , and @xmath59 @xcite , we can assume that the oscillation length @xmath60 is small compared to the linear dimension of the source , so that the source is flavor coherent and the oscillations will be averaged out both over dimension and energy . in any case , due to the large distance of the gc with respect to the dimensions of the detector , this fact does not affect the computation @xcite .",
    "for a point - like source localized in the gc , we can assume that the totally averaged oscillations among the three flavors is given by a symmetric matrix of the form :    @xmath61    the elements @xmath62 depend on the three mixing angles @xmath63 and the cp phase @xmath64 ( read , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there are important uncertainties associated to these values , but a good and simple approximation is given by assuming @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( the present experimental observations constraint these angles as @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite ) . in such a case ,",
    "@xmath62 depends only on the @xmath69 angle in the following way : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we shall not consider the probability to detect a neutrino due to closeness of its production to the detector .",
    "there is also an attenuation effect associated with neutrinos interactions within the earth s volume @xcite .",
    "it only affects to up coming neutrinos and it shall be also neglected in our estimations . by fixing the exposition time ( @xmath73 years in figures [ tfixris ] and [ utfixris ] ) , we can determine the minimum energy @xmath74 that gives a certain number of neutrino events for each observation time ( in the same figures : @xmath75 , which are approximately associated with @xmath76 or @xmath77 if the background events are negligible ) .",
    "on the contrary to the neutrino flux from dm , the events corresponding to the atmospheric background depend on the resolution angle of the telescope . for a given energy cut @xmath74",
    ", we can find the maximum value for the angular field of view @xmath36 necessary to detect a negligible background ( we have allowed @xmath78 event of background for the reported values in figures [ tfixris ] and [ utfixris ] ) .",
    "we have developed this analysis for two channels qualitatively different : @xmath0 boson and @xmath1 quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "following @xcite , dm annihilating into the @xmath0 channel requests a dm mass of around @xmath2 tev to fit the hess gamma - ray spectra of the j@xmath10-@xmath11 source . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ wfigris ] , no neutrino signal produced by such kind of dm is expected with an angle of @xmath79 . in the same figure",
    ", it is shown that the dm flux can be observable for @xmath80 or smaller ( we are assuming a typical resolution energy of @xmath81 ) .",
    "on the other hand , figures [ thetaw ] and [ atw ] are plotted without any constraint in the number of background events .",
    "the minimum energy thresholds for the @xmath0 channel , are reported in tables [ enmin1 ] and [ enmin2 ] for different effective areas and exposition times .",
    "we have studied the variation of the angular field of view and the energy cut .",
    "larger sensitivities require very accurate angular resolutions .",
    "an analysis of energies larger than @xmath82 gev and an effective area of @xmath83 m@xmath84 with an exposition time of @xmath85 yr can provide @xmath86 detection signal for angular resolutions of @xmath87 .",
    "larger angular analyses of the order @xmath88 can provide first evidences of these signatures with less statistical significance . in this case",
    ", the energy cut needs to be larger ( @xmath89 tev ) in order to reduce the atmospheric background . in fig .",
    "[ thetaw ] , we show the resolution angle @xmath36 as function of the minimum energy cut @xmath90 for different statistical significances and exposition times @xmath91 .",
    "similar information about the factor @xmath92 is given in figure [ atw ] .",
    "the j@xmath10-@xmath11 gamma - rays spectrum observed by hess can be also well fitted by dm annihilating in hadronic modes . as an example , we have analyzed the @xmath1 quark - antiquark channel , which requires a mass close to @xmath3 tev @xcite . under this assumption , we have repeated the study developed for the @xmath0 channel . in fig .",
    "[ ufigris ] , we show the expected flux for different angular analyses .",
    "estimations of the minimum energy cut and resolution angles depending on the exposition time and the statistical significance with negligible background are reported in fig .",
    "[ utfixris ] . in table [ uemin ] and fig .",
    "[ usigma ] , we present the results of the analysis for the same hadronic channel without constraining the number of background events , but fixing the effective area and exposition time combination ( @xmath93 in the upper pannel ) or the resolution angle ( @xmath94 in the lower panel ) .",
    "the operation of the icecube neutrino telescope at the south pole , together with several counterparts at the nothern hemisphere , such as antares and nt200 presently , or the future km3net and gvd , are opening a new window in our knowledge of neutrino astronomy .            indeed",
    ", the construction of km3net will imply a new substantial improvement in sensitivity corresponding to a km@xmath95 sized detector . on the other hand ,",
    "radio and airshower detectors , such as anita and the pierre auger observatory are sensitive to neutrinos with even higher energies .",
    "the development of neutrino detectors have increased the interest for analysing the dm nature through the production of astrophysical neutrinos as its primary source .",
    "we have studied the prospective neutrino fluxes that should be originated by dm annihilating in the gc , in the case that the j1745 - 290 hess high energy gamma - rays have this origin @xcite .",
    "the photon spectra is well fitted by different electroweak and hadronic channels .",
    "we have done a explicit analysis for @xmath2 tev dm annihilating in @xmath0 and @xmath3 tev dm annihilating into @xmath1 channel . in these cases ,",
    "the neutrino fluxes are completely determined by assuming that the dm region is localized as it is imposed by the gamma - rays analysis .",
    "we have estimated the best combinations of energy cuts , observation times and angular resolutions of a general high energy neutrino telescope .",
    "for this purpose , we have used icecube atmospheric neutrino observations as background .",
    "in particular , the data collected with exposition time of @xmath96 days and @xmath97 days for the muon and electron neutrinos , respectively @xcite . we have found that for dm annihilating into the @xmath0 boson channel , we need a resolution angle @xmath98 and low energy cut - off @xmath99 gev to get a signal between @xmath100 and @xmath77 with a minimum of 2 years of exposition time and a maximum of five years for a @xmath101 of detector effective area .",
    "the mass associated with the @xmath1 annihilation channel is significantly smaller .",
    "it implies that the neutrino flux produced in this case is less energetic , and more difficult to discriminate from the background .",
    "it demands a higher angular resolution ( @xmath102 ) and the energy cuts need to be smaller ( @xmath103 gev ) in order to accumulate enough events .",
    "we have considered only track signal data by rejecting the muon background and taking into account the total number of events . for a binned analysis with a non - zero background and with a combined analysis of track and shower signatures",
    ", it could be possible to find better experimental configurations that should allow to detect neutrinos produced by heavy dm from the gc with worst resolution angle , smaller effective area or less exposition time .",
    "recently , the icecube collaboration have reported the observation of 28 high energy neutrinos over the range @xmath104 tev @xmath105 pev at @xmath106 of confidence level , and @xmath107 @xmath108 . of these events ,",
    "5 are likely originated from the gc @xcite .",
    "these neutrinos seem to have an astrophysical origin , but the spectrum and direction are not compatible with the signal studied in this work ( the angular resolution in the muon track events is of @xmath109 ) . the dm signal analyzed in this work may only account for a small part of the events",
    ", that will be more likely associated with an electroweak channel , as the @xmath0 annihilating dm model .",
