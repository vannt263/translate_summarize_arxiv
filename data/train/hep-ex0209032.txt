    "the macro detector was located in the gran sasso underground laboratory  @xcite .",
    "thanks to its large area , fine tracking granularity and up - down symmetry , it was a proper tool for the study of upward - travelling muons and neutrino interactions in the apparatus .",
    "the different kinds of neutrino events detected by macro are shown in fig .",
    "[ topo]a  : ( 1 )  upward - throughgoing muons , ( 2 )  semicontained upgoing muons , ( 3 )  upgoing stopping and ( 4 )  semicontained downgoing tracks . the sample ( 1 )",
    "is due to more energetic neutrinos ( @xmath1 ) producing muons also at long distances from the detector .",
    "the other samples are due to neutrinos of lower energy ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the samples ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are indistinguishable and therefore they are studied together ( 3 + 4 ) .    in fig.s",
    "[ topo]b and  [ low ] the angular measurements are shown for samples ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 + 4 ) , respectively .",
    "all distributions are so far from the expectation assuming no oscillation . assuming @xmath3 oscillation the measurements become compatible with expectation  @xcite .",
    "the best fit parameters result @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the measurement of the multiple coulomb scattering  @xcite permits to estimate the energy of muons in sample ( 1 ) .",
    "neutrino energies are inferred by means of monte carlo methods . in fig .",
    "[ mcs]a the data / expectation ratio as a function of estimated @xmath6 is shown .",
    "the last point is due to sample ( 2 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ mcs]b the 90% c.l . allowed regions assuming @xmath3 oscillation are shown .",
    "the smaller area is estimated by normalization and angular distribution of sample ( 1 ) .",
    "the medium area is due to @xmath7-energy estimate for the same sample .",
    "the larger area is deduced by ( 2 ) and ( 3 + 4 ) low energy samples .",
    "a sample of 1356 upward - travelling muons ( @xmath8 ) has been studied to look for astrophysical signals  @xcite .",
    "the data do not show @xmath9-excess from selected pointlike sources .",
    "neutrino - induced muon - flux limits have been established at the level of @xmath10 .",
    "recently the microquasar gx339 - 4 has been proposed as a source of tev neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "we note that macro detected 7 events in the direction of gx339 - 4 , while 2.3 atmospheric neutrinos were expected  @xcite .",
    "another analysis searched for high - energy upward - travelling muons due to astrophysical high - energy diffuse neutrinos .",
    "no statistically significant signal has been found and an upper limit has been set on diffuse neutrino flux assuming @xmath11 as power law spectrum  @xcite .",
