    "in september 2015 , the advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory(aligo ) directly detected , for the first time ever , gravitational waves ( gws )  @xcite and the network of observatories will be joined shortly by advanced virgo  @xcite and kagra  @xcite .",
    "the most likely gw sources for these detectors are mergers of binaries consisting of neutron stars ( nss ) or black holes ( bhs )  @xcite .",
    "if both objects in the binary are nss ( bns ) , or if one is a ns and the other is a bh ( a bhns binary ) , then the tidal deformability of the ns will alter the gw signal in a way that is dependent upon the ns equation of state ( eos ) , allowing these observatories to constrain the eos  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of key importance to understand and model the influence of tidal effects on bns and bhns waveforms .",
    "we show here that a binary black hole ( bbh ) waveform can be augmented with pn tidal effects to accurately model a bns system during the inspiral portion of the binary evolution . in principle",
    ", this method should also be applicable to bhns systems .",
    "bns waveforms are typically computed using post - newtonian ( pn ) methods , which are perturbative expansions in the invariant velocity @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the total mass of the system and @xmath5 is the orbital phase ( here we assume @xmath6 ) . for binaries consisting of nonspinning point particles",
    ", the expansion is known through 3.5pn order  @xcite .",
    "the static ns tidal effects first enter at 5pn order and depend upon the tidal deformability @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 measures how much each ns @xmath8 deforms in the presence of a tidal field , and depends on the ns mass and eos implicitly through its dimensionless love number @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 : @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath12 increases throughout the inspiral , the missing 4pn , 4.5pn , and 5pn point - particle terms can result in the late portion of the pn waveform becoming inaccurate before the static tidal terms are large enough to contribute . for estimating the ns tidal deformability by using pn waveforms , the error introduced by neglecting the higher order pn terms can be as large as the statistical errors due to noise in the measured signals  @xcite .",
    "effective - one - body ( eob ) models that include tidal effects  @xcite also include the merger , and provide better accuracy than pn by tuning higher - order vacuum terms to numerical relativity ( nr ) bbh waveforms .",
    "although eob has accurately reproduced waveforms from nr bns simulations  @xcite , here we discuss a new and different approach that holds considerable promise for modeling tidal interactions during the inspiral .",
    "the most accurate method of computing waveforms is carrying out full nr simulations for bns and bhns binaries ; see  @xcite for recent work .",
    "however , bns and bhns simulations are computationally challenging , since they require solving not only the full einstein equations but also relativistic hydrodynamics with a realistic eos .",
    "it is unfeasible to use nr hydrodynamic simulations alone to cover the parameter space given the wide range of theoretically possible eos and ns masses .",
    "in contrast , bbh systems are easier to simulate with higher accuracy . several large catalogs of bbh simulations and resulting waveforms have been compiled  @xcite .",
    "we introduce here a method we call `` pn tidal splicing '' , which generates bns inspiral waveforms from nr bbh waveforms by adding tidal interactions derived in the pn formalism , effectively replacing the point - particle pn terms by the numerical bbh evolution .",
    "we compare pn tidal splicing to nr using two simulations generated by spec  @xcite , a code developed to evolve einstein s equations and general relativistic hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the first is a new equal - mass bns simulation with @xmath13 orbits before merger  @xcite , and the neutron stars were initialized with gravitational masses @xmath14 and a polytropic eos with @xmath15 , leading to a tidal deformability of @xmath16 .",
    "the other is an equal - mass , nonspinning bbh simulation  @xcite tagged sxs : bbh:0180 in the public simulation catalog of the simulating extreme spacetimes collaboration  @xcite . using tidal splicing , we add tidal terms to the bbh waveform in an attempt to reproduce the bns waveform . as a test , we also subtract tidal terms from the bns waveform in an attempt to reproduce the bbh waveform .",
    "figure  [ fig : nsns_bbh_phase_diff ] shows that the gw phase difference , @xmath17 , between the ` bbh+tidal ' waveform and the bns waveform is the same as the difference between the ` bns@xmath18tidal ' waveform and the bbh waveform , and both are a factor of @xmath19 smaller than the difference between the bns and bbh waveforms throughout the inspiral .",
    "thus we can mimic the inspiral of a full bns simulation to within a few tenths of a radian at a fraction of the cost .",
    "for the bbh waveform , the phase error is estimated by the phase difference between the highest two resolutions .",
    "the bns simulation is a combination of spectral and finite - volume methods with complicated convergence properties ; it is unclear how to construct an accurate error measure  @xcite .",
    "we choose the simple prescription of plotting the phase difference between the highest two resolutions as a crude error estimate . while the bbh error estimate is small , the error estimate in the bns simulation is as large as the tidal effects themselves .",
    "therefore , we can not yet fully verify the accuracy of tidal splicing until more accurate bns simulations are available .",
    "below ( cf .",
    "[ fig : phaseerrorvslambda ] ) we will estimate the phase accuracy required of future bns simulations for such verification .",
    "for nonprecessing binaries , the pn equations for quasicircular orbits read @xmath20 where @xmath21 is",
    "the ratio of two functions , each known to finite pn order in @xmath12 , and also depends on the binary s intrinsic parameters  @xcite .",
    "different ways of evaluating these equations result in different pn approximants that agree to the same pn order in @xmath12 , but diverge at higher orders .",
    "we present methods for tidal splicing using two different approximants .    _",
    "taylort4 . _",
    "if @xmath21 is expanded as a series in @xmath12 and then truncated to the appropriate pn order , then the solution is known as the taylort4 approximant  @xcite . for taylort4 , the tidal effects manifest as additional terms in the power series for @xmath21 . equation  ( [ eq : pneq1 ] ) can be written @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the point - particle terms , and where the additional static tidal terms @xmath24 are known to 6pn order  @xcite .    for inspiraling pn bbhs ,",

    "( [ eq : pneq1_tidal ] ) we write a differential equation for @xmath33 : @xmath34 integrating this expression and inverting yields the function @xmath35 corresponding to the spliced waveform .",

    "( [ eq : pneq2 ] ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the start of the numerical waveform .    in taylort4 ,",
    "the amplitude of the waveform is a function of @xmath12 only , with no explicit time dependence  @xcite .",
    "so here we assume that the amplitude of the original nr waveform @xmath39 is likewise a function of @xmath12 only , so that we can write @xmath40 .",
    "we then use @xmath35 to express this amplitude in terms of @xmath33 . in other words ,",
    "the amplitude of the resulting waveform is @xmath41 .",
    "we generate a bbh waveform from a bns waveform by the same method , except we subtract instead of add @xmath24 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffeq_splicing ] ) .",
    "we require @xmath31 to be monotonic so that @xmath21 is single valued .",
    "to remove high - frequency numerical noise , the derivative in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vfromphi ] ) is computed with a third order savitzky - golay filter  @xcite with a window size of @xmath42 .",
    "this is sufficient when adding tidal terms to the bbh waveform considered here .",
    "however , when testing our method by subtracting tidal terms from a bns waveform , the phase of the bns waveform considered here  @xcite has large enough oscillations in @xmath31 that stronger smoothing is needed .",
    "we proceed by first subtracting the phase of the taylort4 waveform from that of the bns waveform , expanding this difference in chebyshev polynomials , truncating the chebyshev expansion to @xmath43 , and adding back the phase of the taylort4 waveform .",
    "we find that the difference between the smoothed and unsmoothed phase of the bns waveform is less than @xmath44 radians .",
    "as discussed above , figure  [ fig : nsns_bbh_phase_diff ] displays the phase differences between nr and tidally spliced taylort4 waveforms .",
    "we now examine how well _ pure _ pn waveforms agree with nr waveforms . the magenta solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsns_bbh_phase_diff ] show phase differences between taylort4 and bns or bbh waveforms .",
    "the point - particle taylort4 waveform does an excellent job of reproducing the phase evolution of the bbh waveform , about at the level of the bbh numerical error .",
    "however , while taylort4 is surprisingly accurate in the inspiral for equal - mass , nonspinning systems  @xcite , this does not hold true in general  @xcite .",
    "tidal splicing should be applicable to an arbitrary bns / bhns system with spins and/or unequal masses , where there may not be an accurate pn approximant .",

    "_ if eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pneq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : pneq2 ] ) are instead converted to the frequency domain ( fd ) using the stationary phase approximation before expanding the series , the approximant is called taylorf2  @xcite .",

    "the early portion of the waveform is windowed using a planck taper  @xcite while the merger and ringdown provide a natural windowing for the late portion .",

    "differences are shown between a bns and a bbh waveform ( black ) , between a bbh+tidal and a bns waveform ( blue ) , and between a bns@xmath18tidal waveform and a bbh waveform ( red ) at the 6pn ( solid ) and 7.5pn ( dot - dashed ) orders . only the time after the windowing function is shown here , resulting in a shorter time axis here than in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsns_bbh_phase_diff ] .",

    "we roll off the effect of @xmath51 from @xmath58 to @xmath60 with a cosine window .",
    "while this will contaminate the higher frequency content , this should allow the lower frequencies of the inspiral to be mostly unaffected .",

    "it is not clear why the 6pn terms approximate the tidal effects better than the 7.5pn terms ; it may be because we zero the unknown constants in the 7.5pn expression .    .",
    "for our bns simulation , @xmath64 .",
    "contours show selected values of the phase difference .",

    "we have shown that pn tidal splicing of bbh waveforms can produce inspiral waveforms for nonspinning bns systems .",
    "this method should easily generalize to objects with spins and to bhns systems . once a bbh waveform is generated for a particular mass ratio and spin configuration",
    ", it should be easy to produce bns / bhns waveforms via pn tidal splicing for any eos simply by adjusting the tidal parameters @xmath7 , allowing the entire tidal parameter space for inspiral waveforms to be spanned .",
    "the accuracy of this method is limited by that of the pn tidal terms .",
    "in particular , additional finite size effects not captured by the current static tidal pn terms can influence waveform amplitude and phase , and dynamical tidal effects can also contribute to the phase evolution  @xcite , especially as the nss approach merger .",
    "this method in principle can be improved with better pn tidal terms .",
    "unfortunately , it is currently difficult to fully measure the accuracy of tidal splicing until higher - accuracy many - orbit bns simulations are available for multiple masses and eos .",

    "we assume @xmath66 ( corresponding to a prototypical ns mass of @xmath67 ) and an upper frequency cutoff of @xmath68 .    an alternative to computing tidal terms to a higher pn order is to resum them in some way , as is done in  @xcite in the context of eob .",
    "it is not clear how to do this with tidal splicing .",
    "additionally , the merger / ringdown can not be modeled with splicing alone , especially for bns mergers and bhns systems that undergo tidal disruption .",
    "one possibility is to combine an analytic waveform in the very early inspiral with a spliced bbh waveform in the mid to late inspiral and then with a waveform from a full hydrodynamical simulation for the merger and ringdown , to create a `` tribridized '' waveform .",
    "this might reduce the need for expensive hydrodynamical simulations lasting many orbits . if necessary , surrogate models  @xcite that cover the parameter space including the eos can be forged from spliced bbh waveforms .",
