    "the addition of noise in mathematical models of population dynamics can be useful to describe the observed phenomenology in a realistic and relatively simple form .",

    "examples of noise induced phenomena are stochastic resonance , noise delayed extinction , temporal oscillations and noise - induced pattern formation @xcite .",
    "biological complex systems can be modelled as open systems in which interactions between the components are nonlinear and a noisy interaction with the environment is present @xcite .",
    "recently it has been found that nonlinear interaction and the presence of multiplicative noise can give rise to pattern formation in population dynamics of spatially extended systems @xcite .",
    "the real noise sources are correlated and their effects on spatially extended systems have been investigated in refs .",

    "we study the spatio - temporal evolution of an ecosystem of three interacting species : two competing preys and one predator , in the presence of a colored multiplicative noise . we find a nonmonotonic behavior of the average size of the patterns as a function of the noise intensity .",
    "the effects induced by the colored noise , in comparison with the white noise case @xcite , are : ( i ) pattern formation with a greater dimension of the average area , ( ii ) a shift of the maximum of the area of the patterns towards higher values of the multiplicative noise intensity .",

    "@xmath15 are ornstein - uhlenbeck processes with the statistical properties    @xmath16    and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the correlation time of the process , @xmath19 is the noise intensity , and @xmath20 represents the three continuous stochastic variables ( @xmath15 ) , taken at time step @xmath8 .",
    "the boundary conditions are such that no interaction is present out of lattice . because of the environment temperature",
    ", the interaction parameter @xmath21 between the two preys can be modelled as a periodical function of time    @xmath22    here @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath21 oscillates around the critical value @xmath26 in such a way that the dynamical regime of lotka - volterra model for two competing species changes from coexistence of the two preys ( @xmath27 ) to exclusion of one of them ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the parameters used in our simulations are the same of @xcite , in order to compare the results with the white noise case .",
    "specifically they are : @xmath29 ; @xmath30 ; @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the noise intensity @xmath19 varies between @xmath34 and @xmath35 . with this choice of parameters the intraspecies competition among the two prey populations",
    "is stronger compared to the interspecies interaction preys - predator ( @xmath36 ) , and both prey populations can therefore stably coexist in the presence of the predator @xcite . to evaluate the species correlation over the grid we consider the correlation coefficient @xmath37 between a couple of them at the step @xmath8 as    @xmath38^{1/2 } } , \\label{r}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the number of sites in the grid ( @xmath40 ) , the symbols @xmath41 represent one of the three species concentration @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the mean values of the same quantities in all the lattice at the time step @xmath8 . from the definition ( [ r ] ) it follows that @xmath44 .",
    "we quantify our analysis by considering the maximum patterns , defined as the ensemble of adjoining sites in the lattice for which the density of the species belongs to the interval @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 is the absolute maximum of density in the specific grid .",
    "the various quantities , such as pattern area and correlation parameter , have been averaged over 50 realizations , obtaining the mean values below reported .",
    "we evaluated for each spatial distribution , in a temporal step and for a given noise intensity value , the following quantities referring to the maximum pattern ( mp ) : mean area of the various mps found in the lattice and correlation @xmath47 between two preys , and between preys and predator .    from the deterministic analysis we observe : ( i ) for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) a coexistence regime of the two preys , characterized in the lattice by a strong correlation between them and the predator lightly anti - correlated with the two preys ; ( ii ) for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) wide exclusion zones in the lattice , characterized by a strong anti - correlation between preys .",
    "because of the periodic variation of the interaction parameter @xmath21 , an interesting activation phenomenon for @xmath48 takes place : the two preys , after an initial transient , remain strongly correlated for all the time , in spite of the fact that the parameter @xmath21 takes values greater than @xmath52 during the periodical evolution .",
    "we focus on this dynamical regime to analyze the effect of the noise .",
    "we found that the noise acts as a trigger of the oscillating behavior of the species correlation @xmath47 giving rise to periodical alternation of coexistence and exclusion regime .",
    "even a very small amount of noise is able to destroy the coexistence regime periodically in time .",
    "this gives rise to a periodical time behavior of the correlation parameter @xmath47 , with the same periodicity of the interaction parameter @xmath21 ( see eq.([betat ] ) ) , which turns out almost independent of the noise intensity and of the correlation time @xmath18 ( see fig.[cor](a ) ) .",
    "this periodicity reflects the periodical time behavior of the mean area of the patterns .",
    "a nonmonotonic behavior of the pattern area as a function of time is observed for all values of noise intensity investigated .",
    "this behavior becomes periodically in time for lower values of noise intensity , when higher values of correlation time @xmath18 are considered . in figs.[cor](b - d ) we show the time evolution of the mean area of the maximum patterns , for @xmath53 and for three values of correlation time , namely @xmath54 .",
    "the periodicity of the nonmonotonic behavior of the area of mps is clearly observed .",
    "-0.5 cm   and for @xmath55 .",
    "the correlation plot ( a ) is quite the same for all the @xmath18 investigated.,title=\"fig:\",height=302 ] -0.3 cm    -0.5 cm [ cor ]    to analyze the noise induced pattern formation we focus on the correlation regime between preys @xmath56 , where pattern formation appears .",
    "in fact when the preys are highly anticorrelated with species correlation parameter @xmath57 , a big clusterization of preys is observed , with large patches of preys enlarging to all the available space of the lattice .",
    "this scenario , observed also in the white noise case @xcite , is confirmed by the analysis of the time series of the species .",
    "these large patches appear , in the anticorrelation regime corresponding to the exclusion regime of the two preys , with smooth contours and low intensity of species density for lower noise intensities and higher correlation time values .",
    "the study of the area of the pattern formation as a function of noise intensity with colored noise shows two main effects : 1 ) the increase of the pattern dimension and 2 ) a shift of the maximum toward higher values of the noise intensity .",
    "as expected , for low values of the correlation time we observe the same results than in the white noise case .",
    "these effects are well visible in fig .",

    "the interaction step here considered is 1400 , which correspond to the biggest pattern area found in our calculations .",
    "the first curve ( @xmath58 ) is quite the same found in the white noise case .",
    "the value of maximum in the third curve ( @xmath59 ) is not so different from the previous one ( @xmath60 ) , because its value is approaching the maximum possible value of 10.000 into the used grid",
