    "the discovery of the fascinating properties of graphene  @xcite initiates the fountain of experimental and theoretical works devoted to studies of its electronic and structural properties . in most cases",
    "a graphene layer in these works is in contact with the supporting substrate : insulating , semiconducting or metallic .",
    "the latter supports are considered as the most interesting from technological and fundamental - science points of view and several recent reviews have pointed out the importance of these graphene / metal systems  @xcite .",
    "firstly , the preparation of graphene on metals is presently considered as a cheapest way to produce large graphene layers of different thickness that can be transferred onto the polymer or insulating support and then used for preparation of different devices  @xcite .",
    "another interesting , more fundamental , aspect of the graphene - metal interface is the nature of interaction at the interface  @xcite . here",
    ", the intuitive description divides the whole set of the graphene - metal interfaces on two large subclasses of the _ weakly _ and _ strongly _ interacting graphene with metal . as a measure of interaction strength one can consider the bonding energy per carbon atom between graphene and metal , the doping level of graphene , or / and the state and position of the dirac cone in the electronic structure of the system .",
    "interesting to note that this `` graphene - metal interaction '' puzzle is valid for a graphene layer adsorbed on metal as well as for the metal layers deposited on graphene ( free - standing or substrate - supported ) .    among the graphene / metal interfaces , the graphene layers on the lattice - mismatched close - packed surfaces [ rh(111 ) , ru(0001 ) , ir(111 ) , pt(111 ) ]",
    "are under intent attention  @xcite .",
    "the interaction between graphene and metal is abruptly changed from strong to weak interaction when going from rh or ru to ir or pt . moreover , these systems are interesting from the perspective that metal atoms deposited on top of such graphene / metal systems will form an ordered arrays of clusters due to the moir structure of the graphene layer on the lattice - mismatched surfaces . in such moir structures the geometry of the system ( buckling of a graphene layer ) as well as the space variation of the charge ( potential ) will define the structure and the electronic properties of the metal - clusters / graphene / metal systems .    here",
    "we performed the studies of the crystallographic and electronic structure of the strongly - corrugated graphene layer on rh(111 ) via combination of scanning probe techniques ( stm and afm ) and density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "these results show that a graphene layer in this system is strongly corrugated and electron density is strongly localised at the graphene / rh(111 ) interface in places where graphene is strongly bonded to the substrate .",
    "our results give also an information on the role of dispersive forces ( van der waals ) in the bonding mechanism in this system and help to understand the clustering mechanism on top of strongly corrugated graphene layer .",
    "the electronic and structural properties of the graphene / rh(111 ) system are obtained using generalised gradient approximation as parameterized by perdew  _ et al . _ ( pbe )  @xcite to the exchange correlation potential . for solving the resulting kohn - sham equation we use the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite with the projector augmented wave basis sets  @xcite .",
    "the long - range van der waals interactions were accounted for by means of a dft - d2 approach proposed by grimme  @xcite .",
    "this method relies on corrections added to the dft total energy and forces , based on a damped atom - pairwise potential @xmath0 ( @xmath1 represents the dispersion coefficient for a given atom pair and @xmath2 is the distance between the atoms ) .",
    "the studied system is modelled using supercell , which has an @xmath3 lateral periodicity and contains one layer of @xmath4 graphene on four - layer slab of metal atoms .",
    "metallic slab replicas are separated by ca .",
    "18  in the surface normal direction , leading to an effective vacuum region of about 15 . to avoid interactions between periodic images of the slab ,",
    "a dipole correction is applied  @xcite . due to the large lateral periodicity",
    "the surface brillouin zone is sampled with a single @xmath5-point at @xmath6 for structure optimisation ( the positions of the carbon atoms as well as those of the top three layers of rh are optimised ) and set to @xmath7 mesh in the total energy calculations .",
    "the rh - rh spacings in the bottom layer are fixed at the optimised bulk value .",
    "the stm images are calculated using the tersoff - hamann formalism  @xcite , which states that the tunnelling current in an stm experiment is proportional to the local density of states ( ldos ) integrated from the fermi level to the bias . in the visualisation software hive",
    "@xcite it is implemented in its most basic formulation , approximating the stm tip by an infinitely small point source .",
    "the integrated ldos is calculated as @xmath8 with @xmath9 the fermi energy .",
    "an stm in constant current @xmath10 mode follows a surface of constant current , which translates into a surface of constant integrated [ @xmath11 with @xmath12 a real constant ] . for each @xmath12",
    ", this construction returns a height @xmath13 as a function of the position @xmath14 .",
    "this height map is then mapped linearly onto a corresponding colour scale . in afm images simulations ,",
    "the tip - sample force is expressed as a function of the potential @xmath15 on the tip due to the sample : @xmath16 $ ] and transferred to the frequency shift of the oscillating sensor via formalism described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the graphene / rh(111 ) system was prepared in ultra - high vacuum station for stm / afm studies via cracking of propylene gas ( c@xmath17h@xmath18 ) according to the recipe described in details in refs .",
    "prior to the graphene preparation the rh(111 ) was cleaned via cycles of ar@xmath19-sputtering and high - temperature annealing until the clean atomically - resolved images were acquired in stm .",
    "further , the quality and homogeneity of the graphene / rh(111 ) samples were verified by means of low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and stm .",
    "the stm / afm images were collected with aarhus spm 150 equipped with kolibrisensorfrom specs  @xcite with nanonis control system . in all measurements",
    "the sharp w - tip was used which was cleaned _ in situ _ via ar@xmath19-sputtering . in presented stm images the tunnelling bias voltage , @xmath20 ,",
    "is referenced to the sample and the tunnelling current , @xmath21 , is collected by the tip , which is virtually grounded . during the afm measurements the sensor was oscillating with the resonance frequency of @xmath22hz and the quality factor of @xmath23 , and the frequency shift was used as an input signal in a feedback loop for the topography measurements .",
    "the oscillation amplitude was set to @xmath24pm .",
    "the system base pressure was better than @xmath25 mbar during all experiments .",

    "the highest position for carbon atoms is lying at @xmath43 .",
    "this is due to the fact that standard gga calculations give a reasonable result when describing the _ strong _ interaction between graphene and metal , whereas the dispersion forces , neglected by the standard procedure , are important for the description of the _ weakly _ interacting graphene / metal interfaces .",
    "the latter fact was shown to be valid when describing the _ weakly _ adsorbed graphene layer on ir(111 ) , where bonding was explained by the existence of attractive van der waals forces between graphene and ir that modulated by weak bonding interactions at the @xmath30 and @xmath28 places and anti - bonding interaction around @xmath26 positions  @xcite .",

    "this effect is also reflected in the shift of the corresponding carbon - atom - projected density of states in the electronic structure of graphene / rh(111 ) : the graphene - derived states are shifted by @xmath47ev to the larger binding energies compared to the free - standing graphene ( fig .

    "additionally the sublattice symmetry for two carbon atoms in the graphene layer is broken at all places .",
