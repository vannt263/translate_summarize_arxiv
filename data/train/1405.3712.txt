    "there is no immersed closed minimal surface in the euclidean space @xmath0 .",
    "this fact illustrates the existence of simple geometric conditions creating obstructions for a riemannian manifold to admit closed minimal surfaces . in the euclidean space",
    ", we can see the obstruction coming in the following way : by the jordan - brouwer separation theorem every connected smooth closed surface @xmath1 divides @xmath0 in two components , one of them bounded , which we denote @xmath2 .",
    "start contracting a large euclidean ball containing @xmath2 until it touches @xmath3 the first time .",
    "let @xmath4 be a first contact point , then the maximum principle says that the mean curvature vector of @xmath3 at @xmath5 is non - zero and points inside @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 is not minimal .    in this work",
    "we consider two natural and purely geometric properties that imply that a complete non - compact riemannian manifold @xmath7 admits a smooth closed embedded minimal hypersurface . in order to state the result",
    ", we introduce the following notation : we say that @xmath7 has the _ @xmath8-condition _ if there exists @xmath9 and @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 for every @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote , respectively , the maximum sectional curvature for @xmath16-planes contained in the tangent space @xmath17 and the injectivity radius of @xmath7 at @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath7 has bounded geometry then the @xmath8-condition holds for every positive @xmath19 .",
    "our main result is :      . in this case ,",
    "theorem a could be applied.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in the recent paper @xcite , collin , hauswirth , mazet and rosenberg prove that any complete non - compact hyperbolic three - dimensional manifold of finite volume admits a closed embedded minimal surface .",
    "these manifolds have a different behavior at infinity than those considered in theorem a.    in our arguments , the geometric behavior of the ends of @xmath20 involving the @xmath8-condition is used together with the monotonicity formula to provide a lower bound for the @xmath21-dimensional volume of minimal hypersurfaces in @xmath20 that , simultaneously , intersect @xmath2 and contain points very far from it .",
    "the hypothesis involving the mean - concave bounded domain @xmath2 comes from the theory of closed geodesics in non - compact surfaces . in @xmath22 , bangert proved the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics in a complete riemannian surface @xmath20 of finite area and homeomorphic to either the plane , or the cylinder or the mbius band , see @xcite . the first step in his argument is to prove that the finite area assumption implies the existence of locally convex neighborhoods of the ends of @xmath20 .",
    "as a motivation for our approach , we briefly discuss how bangert uses the lusternik - schnirelmann s theory in the case that @xmath20 is homeomorphic to the plane .",
    "if @xmath23 is a locally convex neighborhood of the infinity of @xmath20 whose boundary @xmath24 is not totally geodesic , he proves that @xmath20 contains infinitely many closed geodesics intersecting @xmath25 . to obtain one such curve ,",

    "define the width of @xmath26 with respect to @xmath2 to be @xmath43    more precisely , our min - max technique is inspired by the discrete setting of almgren and pitts .",
    "the original method was introduced in @xcite and @xcite between the 1960 s and 1980 s , and has been used recently by marques and neves to answer deep questions in geometry , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the method consists of applications of variational techniques for the area functional .",
    "it is a powerful tool in the production of unstable minimal surfaces in closed manifolds .",
    "for instance , marques and neves , in the proof of the willmore conjecture , proved that the clifford torus in the three - sphere is a min - max minimal surface .",
    "the min - max technique for the area functional appear also in a different setting , as introduced by simon and smith , in the unpublished work @xcite , or colding and de lellis , in the survey paper @xcite .",
    "other recent developments on this theory can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the almgren and pitts discrete setting , @xmath26 is a homotopy class in @xmath44 .",
    "we define the width of @xmath26 with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath45 , following the same principle as in the above discussion .",
    "then , we prove :      _ let @xmath39 be a closed riemannian manifold , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 be a non - trivial homotopy class .",
    "suppose that @xmath20 contains an open subset @xmath2 , such that @xmath48 is a manifold with smooth and strictly mean - concave boundary .",
    "there exists a stationary integral varifold @xmath3 whose support is a smooth embedded closed minimal hypersurface intersecting @xmath2 and with @xmath49 . _    consider the unit three - sphere @xmath50 and let @xmath2 be a mean - concave subset of @xmath51 .",

    "the intersecting condition in theorem b is optimal in the sense that it is possible that the support of @xmath3 is not entirely in @xmath48 .",
    "we illustrate this with two examples of mean - concave subsets of the unit three - sphere @xmath50 containing no great sphere .",
    "the first example is the complement of three spherical geodesic balls , which can be seen in figure [ figure2 ] .     for which @xmath59 given by theorem b is not entirely inside @xmath2.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in order to introduce the second example ,",
    "observe that @xmath60 can be foliated by constant mean - curvature tori @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "each such surface divides @xmath51 in two components @xmath63 we claim that neither @xmath64 nor @xmath65 contain great spheres . in the case of @xmath64",
    ", we only observe that the great sphere @xmath66 contains no great circle inside @xmath64 .",
    "but any two great spheres in @xmath51 have a great circle in common , at least .",
    "the case of @xmath65 is analogous .",
    "a simple calculation yields that @xmath67 has mean - curvature vector given by @xmath68 in particular , if @xmath69 the torus @xmath70 is a minimal surface , known as the clifford torus .",
    "moreover , @xmath71 points inside @xmath65 , if @xmath72 , and points inside @xmath64 , if @xmath73 .",

    "a @xmath21-varifold @xmath91 in @xmath20 is a radon measure on the grassmannian of unoriented @xmath21-subspaces on @xmath20 .",

    "the second condition above is trivial in the classical case @xmath120 , because the measure of all slices are accounted on the width . to assure that it is possible to achieve the width keeping controlled the @xmath42-measure of all slices , we develop a deformation process for boundaries of open sets in compact manifolds with boundary .",
