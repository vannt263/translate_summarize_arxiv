    "very robust evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations has recently been achieved from solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments .",
    "thanks to this exciting progress in neutrino physics , we are now convinced that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed",
    ". the phenomenon of lepton flavor mixing can be described by a @xmath5 unitary matrix @xmath6 , the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix @xcite , which contains three mixing angles ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and three cp - violating phases ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "four of these six parameters ( i.e. , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , together with two neutrino mass - squared differences ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , can be extracted from the measurements of neutrino oscillations .",
    "a global analysis of current experimental data yields @xcite @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the @xmath17 confidence level , but the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath10 is entirely unrestricted at present . more accurate",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments are going to determine the size of @xmath9 , the sign of @xmath18 and the magnitude of @xmath10 .",
    "the proposed precision experiments for the tritium beta decay @xcite and the neutrinoless double - beta decay @xcite will help to probe the absolute mass scale of three light neutrinos and to constrain the majorana cp - violating phases @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    towards much better understanding of the neutrino mass spectrum and the neutrino mixing pattern indicated by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , many phenomenological ans@xmath19tze of lepton mass matrices have recently been considered and discussed @xcite . among them",
    ", a particularly simple example @xcite is to assume that both the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath20 and the neutrino mass matrix @xmath21 are of the well - known fritzsch texture @xcite . incorporating the fritzsch texture in the canonical seesaw mechanism @xcite with three degenerate right - handed majorana neutrinos , fukugita , tanimoto and yanagida ( fty ) @xcite have proposed an interesting ansatz to account for current neutrino oscillation data . to be explicit ,",
    "the fty ansatz includes two assumptions : ( 1 ) both the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath20 and the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath22 take the fritzsch texture ; and ( 2 ) the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath23 takes the form @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the @xmath5 unity matrix ( i.e. , @xmath26 for @xmath27 , 2 and 3 ) .",
    "then the effective ( left - handed ) neutrino mass matrix @xmath21 in the fty ansatz is given by @xmath28 unless a special assumption is further made @xcite , the texture of @xmath21 is no more of the fritzsch form",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that the fty ansatz is compatible very well with current experimental data on solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to go beyond the fty ansatz by relaxing its second assumption ; namely , the masses of three right - handed majorana neutrinos are allowed to be partially non - degenerate .",
    "we consider three different cases : ( a ) @xmath29 , ( b ) @xmath30 , and ( c ) @xmath3 . indeed , the non - degeneracy or partial non - degeneracy of @xmath0 ( for @xmath31 ) is a necessary condition to get the successful thermal leptogenesis @xcite in order to account for the cosmological baryon - antibaryon asymmetry .",
    "@xcite for an explicit example which illustrates the correlation between the mass splitting of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos and the leptogenesis in the minimal seesaw model . here",
    "we focus on the low - energy phenomenology of the generalized fty ansatz  in particular , we are going to examine how the neutrino masses , flavor mixing angles and cp - violating phases are sensitive to the mass splitting parameters in cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , which deviate from the original @xmath4 case in different ways .",
    "we shall discuss the possibilities to further extend the fty ansatz to accommodate leptogenesis somewhere else .",
    "the remaining part of our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we make some reasonable analytical approximations to calculate the neutrino mass matrix @xmath21 , in which the mass splitting of any two heavy majorana neutrinos has been taken into account . the neutrino mass spectrum and the mns matrix can then be derived for each of the three cases .",
    "section iii is devoted to a detailed numerical analysis of the allowed parameter space in each case , and to the determination of three neutrino masses , three mixing angles and three cp - violating phases .",
    "we also obtain the predictions for the jarlskog invariant of cp violation and the effective masses of the tritium beta decay and the neutrinoless double - beta decay .",
    "finally , a brief summary of our main results is given in section iv .",
    "let us assume that the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath20 and the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath22 are both symmetric and of the fritzsch texture : @xmath32 in which only @xmath33 is real and positive .",
    "@xmath34 can be decomposed as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 } , e^{i \\phi^{}_{l(\\rm d ) } } , 1\\}$ ] with @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] , and @xmath39 we diagonalize @xmath40 by using the orthogonal transformation @xmath41 or @xmath42 , where @xmath43 ( for @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( for @xmath46 ) denote the masses of charged leptons and the eigenvalues of @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the elements of @xmath47 can be given in terms of two parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the elements of @xmath50 can similarly be given in terms of two parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "omitting the subscripts of @xmath53 and those of @xmath54 , we have @xcite @xmath55^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ o^{}_{12 } & = & -i \\left [ \\frac{x(1+xy)}{(1+x)(1+y)(1-y+xy ) } \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ o^{}_{13 } & = & + \\left [ \\frac{xy^3 ( 1-x)}{(1-xy)(1+y)(1-y+xy ) } \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ o^{}_{21 } & = & + \\left [ \\frac{x(1-y)}{(1+x)(1-xy ) } \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ o^{}_{22 } & = & + i \\left [ \\frac{1+xy}{(1+x)(1+y ) } \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ o^{}_{23 } & = & + \\left [ \\frac{y(1-x)}{(1-xy)(1+y ) } \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ o^{}_{31 } & = & - \\left [ \\frac{xy(1-x)(1+xy)}{(1+x)(1-xy)(1-y+xy ) } \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ o^{}_{32 } & = & -i \\left [ \\frac{y(1-x)(1-y)}{(1+x)(1+y)(1-y+xy ) } \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ o^{}_{33 } & = & + \\left [ \\frac{(1-y)(1+xy)}{(1-xy)(1+y)(1-y+xy ) } \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\ ; . \\ ] ] note that @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are imaginary , because the determinant of @xmath59 is negative . the mass matrix @xmath60 is therefore diagonalized by the unitary matrix @xmath61 . in the fty ansatz , @xmath24 is taken and @xmath22 is assumed to be real ( i.e. , @xmath62 or @xmath63 , or equivalently @xmath64 ) .",
    "such an assumption implies that one may diagonalize @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) just by using the orthogonal transformation @xmath65 with @xmath66 : @xmath67 ^ 2}{m^{}_0 } \\ ; = \\ ; \\frac{1}{m^{}_0}\\left ( \\matrix { d^2_1 & 0 & 0 \\cr 0 & d^2_2 & 0 \\cr 0 & 0 & d^2_3 \\cr } \\right ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] from which the neutrino masses @xmath68 can be obtained .",
    "the mns matrix @xmath69 turns out to be @xmath70 .",
    "next we go beyond the fty ansatz by allowing the masses of three heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos ( i.e. , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) to be partially non - degenerate . for simplicity",
    ", we keep the assumption of @xmath74 ( i.e. , @xmath22 is real and @xmath62 holds ) and consider three different patterns of @xmath0 : ( a ) @xmath29 , ( b ) @xmath30 and ( c ) @xmath3 .",
    "we also assume @xmath23 to be diagonal , real and positive in the flavor basis chosen above . given @xmath75 with @xmath76 as we have already discussed ,",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath21 can now be expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 it is easy to check that eq .",
    "( 7 ) can simply be reproduced from eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) by taking @xmath24 .",
    "if the masses of two right - handed majorana neutrinos are not exactly degenerate , their small difference will enter the expression of @xmath80 . to be more transparent , we specify cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) as @xmath81 and then define a single mass splitting parameter @xmath82 for each case .",
    "we obtain @xmath83 to the leading order of @xmath84 , and list the explicit expressions of @xmath85 for three different cases in table i. @xmath86 can be diagonalized by the real orthogonal transformation @xmath87 , where @xmath88 ( for @xmath89 ) denote the neutrino masses and @xmath90 is the product of three canonical euler rotation matrices .",
    "thus it is the unitary matrix @xmath91 that diagonalizes the neutrino mass matrix @xmath21 .",
    "the mass eigenvalues of @xmath86 and the rotation angles of @xmath92 are given in table ii , in which the sub - leading terms of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 have been neglected by assuming @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( i.e. , @xmath100 ) as well as @xmath101 .",
    "one may use the experimental values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 to constrain the parameter space of @xmath104 and @xmath105 . defining the ratio @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108",
    ", we can numerically verify that only @xmath109 is allowed as a consequence of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "taking into account the mass splitting effect , we now express the mns matrix @xmath112 as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is taken to be @xmath115 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "given the value of @xmath84 , one is able to constrain the ranges of @xmath124 and @xmath125 by using current experimental data on @xmath126 and @xmath127 . to be specific ,",
    "here we make use of the following parametrization of @xmath6 @xcite : @xmath128 where @xmath129 , @xmath130 ( for @xmath131 ) , @xmath10 denotes the dirac cp - violating phase , @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for the majorana cp - violating phases . then @xmath132 the leptonic jarlskog invariant of cp violation @xcite reads @xmath133 , which only depends on the dirac phase @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective masses of the tritium beta decay @xmath134 and the neutrinoless double - beta decay @xmath135 are given by @xmath136 and @xmath137 one can see that the dirac phase @xmath10 does not appear in @xmath138 , as guaranteed by the phase convention of @xmath6 in eq . ( 13 ) .",
    "the present experimental upper bounds on @xmath134 and @xmath135 are @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , at the @xmath17 confidence level @xcite .",

    "the neutrinoless double - beta decay may reach the sensitivity @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "we proceed to do a numerical analysis of the generalized fty ansatz with non - vanishing @xmath84 .",
    "the neutrino mass spectrum and the mns matrix depend on seven free parameters : @xmath143 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath144 and @xmath84 .",
    "these parameters may more or less get constrained from the experimental data given in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . in the @xmath145 case , which corresponds to the original fty ansatz , an updated numerical analysis yields @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "these results allow us to make the following predictions : @xmath151 note that the absolute scales of @xmath143 and @xmath71 can not separately be determined from our analysis .",
    "1 shows the allowed regions of @xmath152 vs @xmath153 , @xmath154 vs @xmath155 and @xmath10 vs @xmath156 in the @xmath145 case . to get a ball - park feeling of the effect of non - vanishing @xmath84 on neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing",
    ", we may carry out a general numerical calculation by allowing @xmath84 to vary between @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "then we obtain the generous constraints on @xmath84 and @xmath159 as follows : @xmath160 we have found that the parameter space in the @xmath161 case is essentially distinguishable from that in the @xmath145 case , provided @xmath162 is of @xmath163 or larger .",
    "however , it seems more interesting to consider a small mass splitting between two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos in model building ; i.e. , @xmath164 .",
    "thus we shall fix @xmath165 as a typical input in our subsequent numerical calculations .",
    "such a choice of @xmath162 implies that the analytical approximations made in eq . ( 11 ) and table ii are valid .",
    "table iii shows the allowed ranges of model parameters in cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) with @xmath166 .",
    "note that cases ( a@xmath167 ) , ( b@xmath167 ) or ( c@xmath167 ) correspond to the positive and negative values of @xmath84 in this table , where the predictions for a number of observables are also listed .",
    "some comments are in order .    *",
    "the model parameters @xmath159 and @xmath105 are restricted to the relatively narrow ranges .",
    "the allowed region of @xmath104 is somehow larger than that of @xmath105 in all cases , implying that the flavor mixing angle @xmath7 is less constrained than @xmath8 in the generalized fty ansatz .",
    "there is little limitation to the phase parameter @xmath120 , although @xmath168 has been ruled out in cases ( a@xmath169 ) , ( b@xmath170 ) and ( c@xmath170 ) . in comparison",
    ", the phase parameter @xmath121 always takes values around @xmath171 to guarantee @xmath172 . *",
    "the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing ( i.e. , @xmath173 or @xmath174 ) can only be achieved in cases ( b@xmath175 ) and ( c@xmath175 ) . in all cases",
    ", @xmath176 is not well restricted .",
    "but the smallest neutrino mixing angle @xmath9 has an lower bound in each case : @xmath177 ( a@xmath175 ) , @xmath178 ( a@xmath170 ) , @xmath179 ( b@xmath175 ) , @xmath180 ( b@xmath170 ) , @xmath181 ( c@xmath175 ) and @xmath182 ( c@xmath170 ) . if a reactor neutrino oscillation experiment can reach the sensitivity @xmath183 ( or equivalently @xmath184 ) , it will be able to test our prediction for @xmath9 . *",
    "the ranges of three cp - violating phases are not very restrictive . in particular , the cp - conserving case ( i.e. , @xmath185 )",
    "can not be ruled out at present .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath186 is roughly the same in all six cases .",
    "it is in principle possible to detect @xmath187 in the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments . *",
    "just as we have expected , the neutrino mass spectrum has a normal hierarchy with @xmath188 ev .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath189 is therefore strongly suppressed , at most of @xmath190 ev , which can not be probed by the proposed katrin experiment . in comparison ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath191 is at the level of a few mev , which might be measured in the future neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments .    to see how the parameter space changes from the @xmath192 case to the @xmath193 cases , we plot the allowed regions of @xmath194 vs @xmath195 , @xmath196 vs @xmath197 and @xmath10 vs @xmath135 in figs .",
    "14 . the points in the scatter plots for different parameters",
    "may more or less correlate , because they all depend on the model parameters @xmath84 , @xmath159 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "one can easily see from table ii that the magnitude of @xmath198 is suppressed by the smallness of @xmath199 in case ( a ) , hence the enhancement or suppression effect of @xmath200 on @xmath8 is not obvious at all in fig .",
    "similar arguments hold for @xmath7 in case ( b ) and @xmath9 in case ( a ) .",
    "note that the deviation of @xmath201 from @xmath159 in case ( c ) is also suppressed by the smallness of @xmath105 .",
    "these analytical features are consistent with the numerical results shown in figs",
    "we find that case ( c ) in fig .",
    "4 is most sensitive to the effect induced by @xmath200 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our results , similar to those obtained from the fty ansatz , are essentially stable against radiative corrections from the seesaw scale to the electroweak scale or vice versa .",
    "the reason is simply that @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath201 have a clear normal hierarchy ( or equivalently , @xmath204 and @xmath109 in table iii ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have omitted the insignificant renormalization - group running effects on three light neutrino masses , three flavor mixing angles and three cp - violating phases in our calculations . note",
    "that the structural hierarchy of @xmath21 is not strong , nor is that of @xmath205 . to see this point more clearly",
    ", we have evaluated the ratios of @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 to @xmath143 and listed them in table iii .",
    "taking case ( b@xmath175 ) for example , we have @xmath209 where the absolute value of @xmath143 is unrestricted ( note that only @xmath210 gets constrained from current experimental data , as shown in table iii ) . comparing @xmath205 with the fritzsch - type up - quark mass matrix @xcite @xmath211 where @xmath212 and @xmath213 are typically input , one can observe that the hierarchy of @xmath22 is much weaker than that of @xmath214 . as @xmath20 is strongly hierarchical",
    "@xcite and @xmath23 is close to the unity matrix in our scenario , the weak hierarchy of @xmath22 is the main source of large flavor mixing in the lepton sector .",
    "finally , we stress that our work will make much more sense , if some tension or disagreement appears between the original fty ansatz and more accurate neutrino oscillation data in the near future .",
    "one may also generalize the fty ansatz by abandoning the exact mass degeneracy of three right - handed majorana neutrinos and allowing for @xmath215 .",
    "this case , which involves two small mass splitting parameters , can be regarded as a further extension of cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) discussed in the present paper .",
    "we have generalized the interesting fty ansatz by allowing the masses of three heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos to be partially non - degenerate , and then investigated the phenomenological consequences of this mass splitting on the neutrino mass spectrum , flavor mixing angles and cp - violating phases .",
    "three simple but typical cases have been considered in our analysis : ( a ) @xmath1 , ( b ) @xmath216 and ( c ) @xmath3 .",
    "the analytical approximations and numerical results show that there is the parameter space in every case and the mass splitting effect may play an important role in fitting the experimental data .",
    "we have also obtained the numerical predictions for the jarlskog invariant of cp violation and the effective masses of the tritium beta decay and the neutrinoless double - beta decay .",
    "some of our results can be experimentally tested in the near future .    in our discussions ,",
    "we have taken both the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath22 and the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath23 to be real .",
    "hence there is no leptogenesis even though the mass degeneracy of three right - handed neutrinos is partially broken .",
    "it is of course interesting to introduce non - trivial complex phases into @xmath22 and ( or ) @xmath217 , such that cp violation may appear in the lepton - number - violating and out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos .",
    "we shall elaborate this idea elsewhere , so as to accommodate baryogenesis via leptogenesis in a new extension of the fty ansatz .",
