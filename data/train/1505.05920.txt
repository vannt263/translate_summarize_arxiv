    "for many interesting problems , in particular in general relativity , spherical topologies @xmath4or @xmath5play an important role . in the context of cosmological models the spherical friedman - robertson - walker models , the bianchi ix or the kantowski - sachs models are particularly important examples .",
    "the main difficulty for the numerical ( and analytical ) treatment of spherical manifolds is the fact that these manifolds can not be covered globally by a single regular coordinate patch , and therefore the coordinate description of any smooth tensorial quantity inevitably breaks down somewhere . in the literature",
    "this problem is often referred to as the _ pole problem _ since in standard polar coordinates for the @xmath0-sphere @xmath4these issues appear at the poles .",
    "many approaches have been tried to deal with this issue , see for instance @xcite and references therein . in earlier work @xcite ,",
    "we have presented a numerical framework which applies to situations which involve the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "the main idea of this approach is to implement and extend the algorithm introduced by huffenberger and wandelt ( hwt ) in @xcite to compute a transform for functions of given _ spin - weight _",
    "@xmath6 on the @xmath0-sphere in terms of _ spin - weighted spherical harmonics_. the concepts of the spin - weight , the so - called _ eth_-operators and of spin - weighted spherical harmonics were introduced originally in @xcite and shall be reviewed in section  [ sec : swsh ] below . as a consequence of this formalism ,",
    "our code is ( pseudo-)spectral in space ; time evolutions are performed with the method of lines and standard ode integrators ( see below ) .",
    "we also point the reader to alternative implementations of this and similar formalisms in @xcite .    in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we have studied simple evolution problems , like the @xmath7-maxwell and @xmath7-dirac equation , on fixed @xmath8-backgrounds as test applications for our numerical infrastructure .",
    "the main motivation for this paper now is to apply the same formalism and numerical infrastructure to the much more complicated situation of the full einstein equations . in this context , @xmath0-spheres arise in a very natural way . in the asymptotically flat setting for example",
    "the spatial manifold @xmath9 is often considered which allows to address the spherical character of the far zone of the radiation field . in the cosmological",
    "setting , which we are interested in here , we can find @xmath4-topologies as a consequence of geroch s symmetry reduction @xcite ( see section  [ sec : gerochreduction ] ) when the original spatial manifold has a symmetry .",
    "for example this was the basis for the work by moncrief in @xcite and for subsequent papers , and for the work in @xcite which shall play a particularly important role in section  [ sec : application_test ] . here",
    "the spacetimes of interest have spatial @xmath5-topologies and the metrics have a certain spacelike symmetry such that geroch s reduction yields the spatial manifold @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath10-vacuum einstein equations thereby become @xmath7-coupled einstein - scalar field equations .",
    "all of this is explained in section  [ sec : gerochreduction ] .",
    "notice that geroch s symmetry reduction has also been used to obtain axially symmetric reductions of einstein s equations in the asymptotically flat case ; see for example @xcite .",
    "the extraction of suitable evolution and constraint equations from einstein s equations is essentially the same problem , both in the original @xmath10 and in the reduced @xmath7-case .",
    "we use the _ generalized wave map formalism _ @xcite ( also called generalized harmonic map formalism or simply wave / harmonic map formalism ) which can be understood as a covariant version of the more familiar _ generalized wave / harmonic formalism _ ; the latter was first introduced in @xcite in order to generalize the original harmonic / wave gauge considered in @xcite .",
    "we summarize the wave map formalism in section  [ sec : hyperbolicreduction ] .",
    "it turns out that in combination with the spin - weight formalism all singular terms caused by the singular polar coordinate chart of the @xmath0-sphere can be completely eliminated .",
    "this had already been observed for the simpler equations considered in @xcite .",
    "notice that generalized wave gauges have been used extensively in the literature in various contexts , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the numerical results in this paper are obtained using the spin - weighted spherical harmonics transform in @xcite .",
    "the underlying fourier transform is @xmath0-dimensional as it applies to functions defined on the @xmath0-dimensional manifold @xmath8 .",
    "sometimes however it is interesting to restrict to special classes of functions on @xmath8 and therefore to derive a specialized , but more efficient version of this transform . in our context",
    "we shall be interested in functions on @xmath4which are invariant under rotations around an axis ( in @xmath11 ) , i.e. , functions which do not depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath12 in standard polar coordinates .",
    "for such functions , the @xmath0-dimensional transform is inefficient . in this paper ,",
    "we therefore also present an efficient implementation of a @xmath13-dimensional variant of this transform which applies to such axially symmetric functions on @xmath4 .",
    "the complexity @xmath14 of the @xmath0-dimensional transform is thereby reduced to the complexity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the band limit of the functions on @xmath4 in terms of the spin weight spherical harmonics .",
    "we call this transform the _ axially symmetric spin - weighted transform_. it will be discussed in detail in section  [ sec : numerical_implementation ]",
    ".    finally , section  [ sec : application_test ] is devoted to a test application of our numerical approach .",
    "we discuss different error sources and how they arise in our implementation .",
    "we also study the evolution using the areal gauge and the generalized wave map gauge .",
    "in this section , we give a quick overview of geroch s symmetry reduction @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be a globally hyperbolic @xmath18-dimensional spacetime endowed with a metric @xmath19 of signature ( @xmath20 ) and a global smooth time function @xmath21 whose level sets are cauchy surfaces homeomorphic to @xmath22 .",

    "the operator @xmath31 is the covariant derivative compatible with the metric @xmath19 .",
    "notice that by the frobenius theorem , the field @xmath27 is hypersurface orthogonal if and only if @xmath32 .",
    "we also define @xmath33 it turns out that for vacuum spacetimes @xmath34 with any cosmological constant @xmath35 the @xmath13-form @xmath36 is closed .",
    "this fact allows us to introduce a local twist potential @xmath37 so that @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , @xmath37 is a _",
    "potential if @xmath28 is simply connected as we shall always assume .",
    "let @xmath39 be the set of orbits of @xmath27 on @xmath28 and consider the map @xmath40 where @xmath41 maps every @xmath42 to the uniquely determined integral curve of @xmath27 through @xmath43 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath41 is a smooth map induces a differentiable structure on @xmath39 , and hence it can be considered as a smooth manifold . since @xmath44 , there is a unique smooth lorentzian metric on @xmath39 which pulls back to @xmath45 along @xmath41 .",
    "we write this metric on @xmath39 as @xmath46 . for the same reason , there are also unique functions @xmath47 , @xmath48 on @xmath39 which pull back to @xmath49 and @xmath37 .",
    "it turns out that einstein s field equations with cosmological constant @xmath35 for @xmath50 imply the following set of equations for @xmath51 where @xmath52 we call this system _ the geroch - einstein system _ ( ges ) to denote the covariant derivative operator associated with @xmath53 .",
    "indices are lowered and raised by @xmath53 . ] and it reads @xmath54 with @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the ricci tensor associated with @xmath53 . in fact , the equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 imply that @xmath57 is divergence free .",
    "it thus plays the role of the energy momentum tensor associated with the two scalar fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the @xmath7-dimensional spacetime @xmath39 with metric @xmath53 . as a result",
    ", the ges can be interpreted as the equations of 2 + 1-gravity coupled to two scalar fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 governed by wave - map equations .",
    "suppose for a moment that @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath58 are known and that they satisfy eq .  .",
    "then we can reconstruct a solution @xmath34 of the @xmath10-dimensional einstein vacuum equation with cosmological constant @xmath35 as follows .",

    "alternatively , we use coordinates @xmath80 ( which are also referred to as euler coordinates ) with @xmath81 as above and @xmath82 clearly , both sets of euler coordinates break down at @xmath83 and @xmath41 .",
    "the vector fields @xmath84 and @xmath85 are smooth and non - vanishing vector fields on @xmath5which become parallel at the poles @xmath86 .",

    "now , @xmath1 is a principal fiber bundle over @xmath8 with structure group @xmath92 whose bundle map is the hopf map .",
    "in fact , if @xmath93 and @xmath94 is assumed to be a killing vector ( as we will do ) then @xmath95 is the space of orbits and @xmath41 the corresponding map in geroch s symmetry reduction .    in this paper",
    ", we shall employ this relationship between @xmath5and @xmath4for our studies of @xmath96-symmetric fields . just as a side remark we also mention the case @xmath97 which is a trivial bundle over @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath27 agrees with a vector field tangent to the @xmath98-factor and we introduce appropriate coordinates , then the bundle map @xmath99 takes the same coordinate form as eq .  .",
    "in particular , geroch s symmetry reduction also yields the space of orbits @xmath95 .",
    "hence , almost all techniques which we introduce in this paper , can also be applied to that case .",

    "these terms by themselves are not tensorial and hence give rise to singular terms ( terms proportional to @xmath194 ) and terms which do not have well - defined spin - weights when the frame derivatives are replaced by eth - operators as described before .",
    "the second terms on the left hand sides cancel these problematic terms completely , and consequently , the left hand sides are tensorial .",
    "the right hand sides are tensorial already . as a result of this fully tensorial character of all these equations , the system of evolution equations eq .",

    "as explained earlier , we wish to implement a spectral method based on spin - weighted spherical harmonics to approximate spatial derivatives . a basic introduction to spectral methods",
    "can be found in books like @xcite and references therein .",
    "for the temporal discretization we mainly used the runge - kutta - fehlberg method except for convergence tests for which the explicit 4th - order runge - kutta method is used .",
    "we start this section by describing briefly the algorithm of complexity @xmath14 , where @xmath16 is the band limit of the functions on @xmath4 in terms of the spin - weighted spherical harmonics , to compute the spin - weighted spherical harmonic transforms ( forward and backward ) introduced by huffenberger and wandelt in @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath246 is chosen to be @xmath247 periodic , hence it can be written as a @xmath13-dimensional fourier sum . however , before doing so we need to define the number of sampling points in @xmath244 .",

    "clearly , the subtraction by @xmath0 in the lower half of the circumference comes from the extraction of the poles to avoid oversampling . therefore , to sample a function on @xmath244 we proceed as follows . if the desired number of samples for a function @xmath228 on @xmath4 is @xmath252 , then the number of samples for the extended function @xmath246 on @xmath244 should be @xmath253 and the spatial sampling interval will be @xmath254 .",
    "therefore , the extended function can be written as a @xmath13-dimensional fourier sum by @xmath255 the substitution of this equation into eq .",
    "yields @xmath256 where @xmath257 is a function @xmath258 defined by @xmath259 by comparison with eq .",
    "we note that the latter is proportional to a discrete convolution in the spectral space .",
    "therefore , it can be evaluated as a multiplication in the real space such that @xmath260 is the @xmath13-dimensional forward fourier transform of @xmath261 as follows @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the real - valued quadrature weight in @xmath244 given by @xmath264 finally , we want to emphasize that even though this way of sampling functions on @xmath244 allows to include the value of the extended function at the poles , it yields an even number of modes in spectral space .",
    "hence , we will not have the same number of positive and negative modes after application of asft .",
    "indeed , for the mode @xmath265 ( see eq .  ) , the vector @xmath266 can not be calculated since the term @xmath267 is not given by the @xmath13-dimensional forward fourier .",
    "we avoid this issue by calculating the set of @xmath268 terms up to @xmath269 .",
    "note that setting @xmath265 to zero does not constitute a loss of information due to the exponential decay of the spectral coefficients of the fourier transform .",
    "in fact , this extra mode is in general numerically negligible and hence , it will not affect the accuracy of the asft .",

    "we set @xmath278 because in the implementation of the asft we chose @xmath279 .",

    "this function satisfies the symmetry properties in eq .   where @xmath228 represents the function @xmath280 on @xmath281 .",
    "thus , @xmath280 corresponds to the extension of the function @xmath228 on @xmath244 .",
    "so far the forward and backward spin - weighted spherical harmonic transforms have been simplified for axially symmetric functions by the implementation of a @xmath13-dimensional fourier transform instead of a @xmath0-dimensional one as required in the algorithm hwt .",
    "in fact , we can simplify the computation of the @xmath219 terms even further .",
    "this has a significant effect on the efficiency of both asft and asbt , given that such a task takes around half of the execution time in practical situations .",
    "we therefore devote this section to discuss this issue .",
    "before we explain how the @xmath219 terms are computed , we bring up a relevant fact for both asft and asbt . by examination of eq .   and",
    "eq .  , we realize that we do not really need to calculate the complete set of @xmath219 terms and @xmath216 take integer values from @xmath217 to @xmath218 . ] to perform the transform . instead , we just need to compute up to the @xmath282 term , where @xmath6 is the spin - weight of the function that is supposed to be transformed .",
    "this yields a remarkable speed - up of the algorithm since in most cases @xmath283 .",
    "now , based on this , we proceed to compute the @xmath282 terms implementing the recursive algorithm introduced by trapani and navaza in @xcite .",
    "the recursive relations are given by the following equations @xmath284 where the letters `` @xmath285 '' , `` @xmath286 '' and `` @xmath287 '' denote the sequence in which they should be used .",
    "we note that terms with a combination of indices outside of the correct range are set to @xmath185 .",
    "one way to visualize the above algorithm is by means of the pyramidal representation of the @xmath282 terms in fig .",
    "[ piramide ] .",
    "the volume of the complete pyramid represents the complete set of the @xmath219 terms . setting the top peak of the pyramid as @xmath288 , we start moving down both in the vertical direction using rule @xmath285 , and in the diagonal direction by @xmath286 .",
    "thus , one can find the @xmath282 terms in the right - hand side in the front face of the pyramid .",
    "then , using rule @xmath287 repeatedly , one can find the terms behind the front face in order to calculate the right - hand side of the pyramid volume .",
    "if we need to compute the full set of @xmath219 terms , we would need to repeat this algorithm in order to obtain the complete right - hand side of the pyramid volume .",
    "however , we just need to repeat step @xmath286 until we reach the row corresponding to @xmath289 ( for the given @xmath218-level ) because we are just interested in computing the first @xmath282 terms .",
    "moreover , since only the @xmath282 terms with positive values of @xmath215 are needed to compute both asft and asbt ( see eqs .   and ( [ eq : bwdfsh ] ) ) , we apply rule @xmath287 until we reach the column @xmath290 .",

    "we have presented both the forward and backward spin - weighted spherical harmonic transform for the axi - symmetric case by implementing simplifications of the general algorithm hwts in order to optimize them for axially symmetric functions in @xmath4 .",
    "the first main simplification is the replacement of the @xmath0-dimensional by a @xmath13-dimensional fourier transform for both the forward and backward transforms .",
    "this reduces the number of computations to @xmath294 .",
    "the second simplification lies in the fact that both the forward and backward transforms do not need the full set of @xmath219 terms in the axial case .",
    "therefore , the resulting algorithm requires @xmath15 operations for each transform .",
    "however , if we precompute the wigner coefficients @xmath236 then the transform is only requires @xmath295 operations .",
    "these transform have been implemented in a python 2.7 module .",
    "furthermore , the module allows to define objects that represent spin weighted functions for which an algebra can be defined .",
    "hence , it can be seen not only as a set of functions , but as a python environment for working with axi - symmetric swsh .",
    "because the axially symmetric transforms are based on the fourier transform , we expect that spectral coefficients decay exponentially to zero when the band limit tends to infinity .",
    "theoretically speaking , a function is described in spectral space by an infinite number of spectral coefficients .",
    "on the other hand , because of the machine rounding error which corresponds to standard `` double precision '' . ] , any sufficiently smooth function is described by a finite set of spectral coefficients that contribute numerically to the spectral decomposition . in other words ,",
    "the spectral coefficients with order lower than @xmath296 are negligible numerically , and thus are not necessary for an accurate description of functions in the spectral space .",
    "hereafter , we call the @xmath218-order of the last mode above order @xmath296 as the _ optimal band limit_. consequently , in virtue of eq .",
    "the optimal band limit defines the _ optimal number of grid points_. taking a larger number of grid points than the optimal one will add unnecessary computations in the transform and consequently the accuracy is reduced instead of enhanced .",
    "we refer to this as the sampling error .",
    "in our implementation we control this error by keeping the number of grid points as close as possible to the optimal case . to this end , we proceed as follows .",
    "initially , we sample the initial data in a large grid . in our case",
    "we have chosen @xmath297 .",
    "then , we apply the asft to each function of the initial data and identify the highest mode which is just above the threshold @xmath296 . in other words ,",
    "we identify the optimal band limit for each function of the system . from all these modes we set the order of the highest mode as the optimal band limit for the initial data .",
    "henceforth we will refer to this as _ the global optimal band limit_. using eq .",
    "we obtain the optimal number of grid points required to sample the functions of the system . finally , we begin the numerical solution of the system by interpolating the initial data in the optimal grid .",
    "now , we discuss how we keep the optimal grid size during the evolution . for each time step , we check the last mode of each field in order to observe whether they are smaller than some given tolerance . for this implementation",
    "this has been set to @xmath298 .",
    "then , if some of those modes do not satisfy the mentioned condition , it implies that the number of grid points is not enough for sampling some of the functions of the system .",
    "therefore , we need to interpolate all the functions to a bigger grid .",
    "we point out that the new grid should not differ too much from the previous one because , as we mentioned before , it could lead to too many unnecessary grid points and hence to larger errors . in this implementation",
    ", we decided to increase the grid by four points each time this is required . using this small increment",
    ", we expect to stay close enough to the optimal grid and as a consequence keep a good accuracy .    to finalize this section we point out that due to non - linearities in our evolution equations , some kind of filtering process is required in order to avoid the so - called aliasing effect .",
    "for this we use the well known 2/3-rule . for details and justification of this rule , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is well known that solutions of einstein s field equations are uniquely determined ( up to isometries and questions of extendibility ) by the cauchy data on a cauchy surface . however , there exist cases for which the uniquely determined maximal globally hyperbolic development @xcite of the data can be extended in several inequivalent ways .",
    "these extensions are not globally hyperbolic and hence there are _ cauchy horizons _ whose topology and smoothness may in general be complicated .",
    "furthermore , there can exist closed causal curves in the extended regions which violate basic causality conditions .",

    "we shall do this for two sets of gauge source functions .",
    "before we go into the details in sections  [ sec : numareal ] and [ sec : numharmonic ] , however , let us discuss possible numerical error sources which we shall refer to in our discussion of our numerical results below .    clearly the time and spatial discretization",
    "gives rise to numerical errors .",
    "in general it is expected that time discretization errors are larger than spatial ones thanks to the rapid ( exponential ) convergence of the latter . in order to investigate the presumably more significant time discretization errors we shall use two different time discretization schemes , the ( non - adaptive ) 4th - order runge - kutta scheme and the ( adaptive ) runge - kutta - fehlberg ( rkf ) scheme .",
    "see @xcite for details about adaptive runge - kutta methods .",
    "spatial discretizations shall always be based on our adaptive framework discussed in section  [ sec : choosing_grid ] . for runs using the adaptive rkf scheme",
    ", we can therefore expect that all discretization errors can be made sufficiently small by choosing suitable tolerance parameters .    in our numerical experiments we identify further error sources which turn out to be particularly severe .",
    "recall from section  [ sec : choosing_grid ] that we choose the same band limit for _ all _ unknowns .",
    "however , in most of our practical examples , _ only few _ of the unknowns actually require high spatial resolutions . as a consequence ,",
    "many unknowns are _ oversampled _ , which is not only inefficient numerically , but also generates undesired numerical noise .",
    "the origin of this noise is that the `` unnecessary '' modes associated with too large band limits are in general not zero numerically .",
    "in fact , while they are typically of the order of the machine precision initially , they may grow during the evolution in particular due nonlinear coupling of modes .",
    "typically , the larger the difference between the optimal band limit for any particular unknown and the global band limit is , the larger is this noise .",
    "this error is difficult to control in practice and it is quite common that once this noise has started to grow during the evolution it continues to grow increasingly fast . we measure this error by looking at the evolution of the highest modes of certain representative unknowns during the evolution",
    ". the only conceivable cure of this problem would be to work with higher machine precisions , which would , however , significantly slow down the numerical runs .",
    "our numerical infrastructure is completely based on `` double precision '' .",
    "we have not attempted to work with higher machine precisions such as `` quad precision '' yet .",
    "further comments on this in the context of a different numerical infrastructure can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "another severe , but not fully independent numerical error is associated with the violation of the constraints . recall that due to eq .",
    ", the condition @xmath334 is identically satisfied during the evolution if ( i ) the evolution equations hold exactly and ( ii ) the constraints eqs .   and are satisfied initially . for our numerical calculations , however , both of these conditions are violated .",
    "let us for the sake of this argument imagine that the constraints are violated at the initial time , but that the evolution equations hold identically ( i.e. , we pretend that the numerical evolutions are done with an infinite resolution in space and time and with infinite machine precision ) . then eq",
    ".   describes the ( exact ) evolution of the in general non - zero constraint violation quantities @xmath335 .",
    "since the initial data for these quantities are now assumed to be non - zero , their evolution is in general also non - zero .",
    "depending on the particular properties of the evolution system and hence of eq .  , these quantities may in fact grow rapidly during the evolution .",
    "if this is the case , the constraint violation error can become large very quickly even if it is small at the initial time , and the resulting numerical solutions of einstein s equations therefore become useless quickly .",
    "this situation can not be improved by increasing the numerical resolution . in fact , this error is a consequence of the structure of the _ continuum _ evolution equations .",
    "various ways to reconcile this problem have been proposed in the literature .",
    "one of the most promising ideas @xcite is to introduce constraint damping terms , i.e. , to add terms to the evolution equations ( i ) which are proportional to the constraint violation quantities ( hence the solutions of the evolution equations for the actual case of interest @xmath334 are unchanged ) and ( ii ) which , however , turn the surface @xmath334 into a future attractor for eq .  .",
    "this technique has proved to be quite useful to produce stable calculations for asymptotically flat spacetimes ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the analytic derivation of suitable constraint damping terms is in general difficult and is usually done based on approximations which may only hold in certain regimes of the evolution ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper here",
    "we work without constraint damping terms .",
    "nevertheless , we remark that thanks to the close relationship of our formulation of einstein s equations with the ones used in the above references , similar choices of constraint damping terms are expected to be useful in reducing the constraint violation errors in our applications .",
    "indeed we have already gathered some promising experience with constraint damping terms of the type used in @xcite which we shall report on in a future article .      in this section now , we shall fix the gauge freedom for the evolution equations by identifying the gauge source functions @xmath336 with the contracted christoffel symbols given by eqs .

    "hence it is not necessary to introduce terms in eq .   which account for the first time derivative of @xmath318 at @xmath353 .",
    "we apply this idea to calculate the same spacetimes as before , but now we choose the _ wave gauge _ as the target gauge , which is defined by the condition @xmath354 . for our numerical tests",
    "we choose @xmath355 in eq .  .",
    "before we present our numerical results we notice that it is straightforward to derive the formula @xmath356 which for our spacetimes relates the time coordinate @xmath21 in areal gauge ( used in section  [ sec : numareal ] ) and the time coordinate @xmath357 in wave map gauge .",
    "this formula holds identically even though eq .",
    "is strictly speaking not the exact wave map gauge .",
    "however as a consequence of @xmath358 which follows from eq .  , the target gauge source function @xmath359 agrees identically with @xmath360 .",
    ".   is then obtained by solving the exactly homogeneous wave map equation for the wave map time coordinate function with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "eq .   allows us to make direct comparisons between our results here and the results in the previous section .",
    "in particular , it reveals that the wave time slices @xmath361 are the same as the areal time slices @xmath362 ( for different constants ) , and , the `` singularities '' at @xmath363 are shifted to infinity , in particular , @xmath364 for @xmath365 .",
    "we point out however that it is not possible to derive a formula which relates the spatial coordinates in both gauges . this is true even if @xmath351 in eq .",
    "was so large that we could consider our gauge as the exact wave map gauge .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the homogeneity of the wave equations for the spatial wave map coordinates is destroyed by terms given by the reference metric eq .  .",
    "in fact we shall demonstrate below that the spatial coordinates on each time slice are different in areal and wave map coordinates .    in order to obtain a more geometric and detailed comparison of the two gauges , we consider the eikonal equation following  @xcite @xmath366 let @xmath367 be a smooth solution of the initial value problem of the eikonal equation with smooth initial data @xmath368 prescribed freely on any smooth cauchy surface @xmath369 in any smooth globally hyperbolic spacetime .",
    "the method of characteristics applied to this pde allows to prove that such a solution indeed always exists at least sufficiently close to the initial hypersurface @xmath369 . for definiteness",
    "now we restrict to the case of zero initial data @xmath370 for all of what follows .",
    "fix any point @xmath43 in the timelike future of @xmath369 in the spacetime and consider any timelike geodesic through @xmath43 ( with unit tangent vector ) .",
    "any such geodesic must intersect @xmath369 at some point @xmath371 in the past of @xmath43 .",
    "there is precisely one such timelike geodesic through @xmath43 with unit tangent vector which intersects @xmath369 perpendicularly in @xmath371 and hence the point @xmath371 is uniquely determined .",
    "the value @xmath372 of the solution @xmath367 of the eikonal equation with zero initial data then represents the proper time along this timelike geodesic from @xmath371 to @xmath43 .",
    "the quantity @xmath367 is therefore a meaningful geometric scalar quantity which can be used to compare our numerical spacetimes , in particular when the same spacetime is calculated in different coordinate gauges .",
    "we proceed as follows . for initial data parameters @xmath322 , @xmath321 and @xmath373 ( see section  [ sec : exactsol ] ) :    1 .",
    "we calculate the corresponding solution of einstein s evolution equations in areal gauge ( in the same way as in section  [ sec : numareal ] ) and of the eikonal equation eq .",
    "( with zero initial data ) up to @xmath374 .",
    "the value of the resulting @xmath367 function on the @xmath374-surface expressed with respect to spatial areal coordinates yields the dashed curve in fig .",
    "eq .   implies that @xmath374 corresponds to @xmath375 .",
    "for the same initial data parameters as in the first step , we calculate the corresponding solution of einstein s evolution equations in wave gauge numerically ( using the gauge driver condition eq .   with @xmath355 ) and of the eikonal equation eq .",
    "( with zero initial data ) up to @xmath375 .",
    "the value of the resulting @xmath367 function on the @xmath375-surface expressed with respect to spatial wave map coordinates yields the continuous curve in fig .",
    "[ f9n ] .",
    "since the @xmath374-surface and the @xmath375-surface represent the same geometric surface in our spacetime and since @xmath367 is a geometric scalar quantity , the value of the solution of the eikonal equation on this surface should be the same function in both steps above .",
    "however , since this function is expressed in terms of different spatial coordinates , namely areal coordinates in the first step and wave map coordinates in the second step , the two curves in fig .",
    "[ f9n ] are slightly different .",
    "hence fig .",
    "[ f9n ] can be understood as a representation of the difference of these two sets of spatial coordinates .",
    "this difference is emphasized in fig .",
    "[ f10n ] where the two curves in fig .",
    "[ f9n ] are subtracted directly .",
    "intuitively , these two sets of spatial coordinates should agree at geometrically distinct points , namely , at the poles and also at the equator as a consequence of a reflection symmetry which is inherent to our particular class of exact solutions . indeed the difference curve in fig .",
    "[ f10n ] is zero at the poles @xmath376 and the equator @xmath377 .",
    "next , we present plots of the constraint violations in both gauges ; see fig .",
    "the dashed curve has been calculated in areal gauge ( in the first step above ) .",
    "the continuous curve has been calculated in wave map gauge ( in the second step above ) , but has then been expressed in terms of the areal time function by means of eq .  .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the constraint violations are significantly smaller in wave map gauge than they are in areal gauge towards the end of the numerical evolution .",
    "finally we comment on the fact that in wave map gauge the shift quantity @xmath378 in eq .",
    "is a non - trivial non - zero function in contrast to areal gauge ; see eq .  .",
    "when @xmath378 can not be assumed to be zero identically , the algebraic complexity of the evolution equations is increased dramatically .",
    "it is surprising that irrespective of this it appears that we get better numerical results in wave map than in areal gauge .",
    "the purpose of our work here was to introduce a numerical approach to solve the cauchy problem for spacetimes which involve the manifold @xmath4 .",
    "we employ a fully regular representation of the einstein equations based on the spin - weighted spherical transform and the generalized wave map formalism .",
    "this allows us to account for all singular terms explicitly which usually arise as a consequence of the coordinate singularities of polar coordinates at the poles of the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "our numerical infrastructure is based on the spin - weight formalism and corresponding transforms introduced in @xcite .",
    "we have extended this infrastructure so that it now provides an efficient treatment of axially symmetric functions on the @xmath0-sphere , reducing the complexity @xmath14 of the full transform to the complexity @xmath15 .",
    "we therefore expect this method to be useful also for other applications in future work .",
    "we have also demonstrated the consistency and feasibility of our approach by means of numerical studies of certain inhomogeneous cosmological solutions of the einstein s equations .    as another application of this method we are currently studying the critical behavior of perturbations of the nariai spacetime @xcite . in particular it is suggested that larger amplitudes of the perturbations , which had not been studied before , could lead to the formation of cosmological black holes .",
    "it would be of great interest to explore the threshold solutions and the expected cosmological black hole solutions as well as consequences for the longstanding cosmic no - hair and cosmic censorship conjectures .",
    "other conceivable interesting applications where our numerical infrastructure can be applied directly are robinson - trautman solutions @xcite and ricci flow @xcite .",
    "whether we want to solve the cauchy problem for the @xmath10-einstein vacuum equations @xmath379 or for the @xmath7 equations , the first task is always to extract hyperbolic evolution equations and constraint equations with well - understood propagation properties from the equation for the ricci tensor of the unknown metric .",
    "we shall now briefly discuss the `` generalized wave map formalism '' .",
    "in most of the literature , the related ( but not covariant ) generalized wave / harmonic formalism is used . while this is sufficient for many applications , it is a drawback for us .",
    "in fact , for applications with spatial @xmath8-topologies covered by a single singular polar coordinate system , it is far more convenient to work with actual covariant quantities ( i.e. , smooth tensor fields ) .",
    "the reason is that frame components of smooth tensor fields on @xmath8 have well - defined spin - weights ( despite of the fact that the frame itself is singular at the poles ) so that they are expandable in spin - weighted spherical harmonics , which are globally defined regular ` functions ' on the @xmath0-sphere ( even though their coordinate representation may be singular ) .",
    "it turns out that expressing everything with respect to these bases , renders the equations manifestly regular .    to this end",
    ", we discuss the geometric formulation of the wave map gauge @xcite .",
    "we consider a map @xmath380 between two general smooth 4-dimensional manifolds @xmath28 and @xmath381 ( or open subsets thereof ) equipped with lorentzian metrics and @xmath381 are @xmath215-dimensional manifolds for some arbitrary positive integer @xmath215 and if @xmath163 is a general smooth pseudo - riemannian ( not necessary lorentzian ) metric . ]",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath163 .",
    "the map @xmath382 is called a wave map if it extremizes the functional @xmath383 = \\int_m \\mathrm{tr}_h ( \\phi^*\\bar h)\\,\\mathrm{vol}_h.\\ ] ] in coordinate charts @xmath384 on @xmath28 and @xmath385 on @xmath381 we obtain the euler - lagrange equations for the coordinate representation @xmath386 of @xmath382 @xmath387 here , @xmath388 are the christoffel symbols for the metric @xmath163 in the coordinate basis on @xmath381 , and @xmath389 is the wave operator for scalar functions defined by @xmath53 .",
    "this equation is called the _ wave - map equation_. more details can be found in @xcite . if the manifolds were riemannian then the analogous equation would characterize a harmonic map between @xmath28 and @xmath381 .",
    "let us point out that the left hand side of the equation defines a geometric object , namely a section in the pull - back bundle @xmath390 .",
    "this is not immediately obvious due to the appearance of the christoffel symbols in the second term .",
    "however , the tensorial character of that term under change of coordinates in @xmath381 is compensated for by the first term which , by itself , is also non - tensorial under such coordinate transformations .",
    "the _ generalized wave - map _ equation is the equation   with a non - vanishing , arbitrary right hand side , a section in @xmath391 with coordinate representation @xmath392 @xmath393 the minus sign on the right - hand side is a matter of conventions .",
    "suppose now that @xmath394 and @xmath395 .",
    "then @xmath384 and @xmath385 are two coordinate charts for @xmath28 and   can be read as an equation determining the coordinate system @xmath385 for @xmath28 by imposing a geometrical gauge condition .",
    "this equation is a semi - linear wave equation of @xmath28 which has solutions near any cauchy surface so that such a coordinate gauge always exists locally .",
    "choosing the coordinates according to this gauge , i.e. , putting @xmath396 and expressing the wave operator in these coordinates yields the equation @xmath397 where @xmath398 are the christoffel symbols of the metric @xmath399 on @xmath28 . in this equation",
    "the tensorial character becomes manifest since the left hand side involves the difference of two connection coefficients so it gives the components of a vector field in the coordinate basis of the @xmath384 .",
    "therefore , this equation holds in any basis on @xmath28 as long as we interpret the christoffel symbols as the connection coefficients with respect to the chosen basis .",
    "note also that this implies that imposing the equation   _ does not _",
    "constitute a condition on the coordinate system @xmath400 but a condition _ on the metric components _ in their dependence on the coordinates .",
    "we define the vector field @xmath157 in terms of its components @xmath401",
    "so , @xmath402 when is imposed .",
    "a metric @xmath53 which is restricted by @xmath402 is said to be in wave map gauge ( with respect to @xmath403 ) ; in eq .",
    "we fix a particular metric @xmath403 .",
    "we point out that the wave map gauge reduces to the widely used generalized wave / harmonic gauge characterized by @xmath404 on space - times with topology @xmath405 when the minkowski metric in cartesian coordinates @xmath406 is used as a reference metric  @xmath403 ."
