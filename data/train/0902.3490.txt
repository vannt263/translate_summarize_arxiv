    "application of the algebra of biquaternions to equations of electromagnetism has been subject of an important number of research articles and books ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite  and many others ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to present some recent results in the field concerning the usage of algebraic advantages of biquaternions for analytic and numerical solution of maxwell s system for chiral media as well as for inhomogeneous media .",
    "compared to a considerable number of publications dealing with biquaternionic reformulations of maxwell s equations for a vacuum or for a homogeneous isotropic medium , application of biquaternions to electromagnetic models corresponding to more complicated media ( a much more challenging object for studying ) was discussed in relatively few sources ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile the possibility of representation of maxwell s system for a vacuum in the form of a single biquaternionic equation is known since 1919 @xcite , only recently it became clear how this result can be generalized for inhomogeneous media @xcite , @xcite and for chiral media @xcite .",
    "an appropriate quaternionic or biquaternionic reformulation of a first order system of mathematical physics opens the way for applying different methods which in many aspects preserve the algebraic power of complex analysis .",
    "for example , it is not easy to arrive at the cauchy integral formula for holomorphic functions using two - component vector formalism or even more difficult task to develop using this formalism a holomorphic function into a taylor series",
    ". no mathematician  would consider such way of presenting complex function theory helpful or appropriate .",
    "however , this is precisely what is happening in the study of three or four - dimensional models of mathematical physics .",
    "compare , e.g. , the stratton - chu integrals written in their standard form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with their biquaternionic representation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite which is in fact a convolution of a biquaternionic fundamental solution of the maxwell operator with the electromagnetic field and it is quite evident that the latter is natural and elucidating .",
    "the meaning of the stratton - chu formulas as a cauchy integral formula for the electromagnetic field becomes transparent and no doubt in their biquaternionic form the stratton - chu formulas could be included in a moderately advanced course of electromagnetic theory which is not the usual case up to now in spite of their central role in electrical engineering applications .",
    "the results presented in this work are essentially quaternionic  in the sense that it is not clear how they could be obtained with other techniques . in the first part",
    "( sections 2 - 5 ) we explain a numerical method for solving electromagnetic scattering problems with an unusual for three - dimensional models precision by the aid of biquaternionic fundamental solutions which to the difference of the usually utilized matrix fundamental solutions for the maxwell equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) enjoy some advantageous properties .",
    "first of all they are not matrices but vectors ( of four components ) .",
    "second , they have a clear physical meaning of fields generated by point sources .",
    "third , their singularity is lower than that of fundamental solutions based on a matrix approach .",
    "the main idea of this work is to explain how our approach works and how it can be used .",
    "we only formulate some necessary results like those about the completeness of our systems of quaternionic fundamental solutions in appropriate functional spaces referring the interested reader to some previous publications , in particular @xcite where the corresponding proofs can be found .    in sections 6 - 8",
    "we consider the time - dependent maxwell system for chiral media , rewrite it in a biquaternionic form as a single equation and then construct explicitly a corresponding green function .",
    "section 9 is dedicated to the time - dependent maxwell equations for inhomogeneous media .",
    "we show that these equations can also be written as a single biquaternionic equation . in a static case",
    "the corresponding quaternionic operator factorizes the stationary schrdinger operator .",
    "we study relationship between solutions of these important physical equations .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the set of complex quaternions (= biquaternions ) . each element @xmath1 of @xmath0 is represented in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the unit and @xmath5 are the quaternionic imaginary units : @xmath6 @xmath7 we denote the imaginary unit in @xmath8 by @xmath9 as usual . by definition",

    "complex quaternions of the form @xmath19 are called purely vectorial and can be identified with vectors from @xmath20 . the operator of quaternionic conjugation we denote by @xmath21 : @xmath22 .",
    "let us introduce the operator @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , whose action on quaternion valued functions can be represented in a vector form as follows @xmath25 that is , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
