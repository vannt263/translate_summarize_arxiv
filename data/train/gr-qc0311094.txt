    "a candidate for the spin foam model of lorentzian gravity was proposed by barrett and crane @xcite .",
    "this model was constructed based on harmonic analysis on the homogenous space @xmath3 which is the upper sheet of the two - sheet hyperboloid in four dimensional minkowski space - time .",

    "but , perez and rovelli @xcite also proposed an alternative spin foam model based on the homogenous space @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that there must be a model which contains both these models .",
    "we call this model the general model while we call the rovelli - perez and the barrett - crane model the partial models .    to construct a lorentzian spin foam model both barrett - crane and rovelli - perez proceed by analogy with the construction of the riemmanian spin foam model . to explain our method for construction of the general model ,",
    "let us discuss first the construction of the spin foam model of riemannian gravity model . the first step is to do the path integral quantization of the @xmath6 bf  theory @xcite using its discrete action to get its  spin foam model @xcite .",
    "then the next step is to impose the barrett - crane constraints at the quantum level .",
    "this is supposed to result in the spin foam model of the riemannian gravity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , .",
    "the third step is to rewrite the simplex amplitude in terms of certain propagators in the homogenous space  @xmath7 . to construct a lorentzian spin foam model both barrett - crane and rovelli - perez proceed by analogy with the third step .",
    "but the problem with this approach is , that there are three possible subgroups for @xmath0 , which could be used for a barrett - crane type construction namely @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . because of this",
    ", the analogy can not suggest a unique lorentzian spin foam model .",
    "we here construct the lorentzian spin foam model starting from the first step using the gelfand - namark representation theory of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the assumption is that this method would yield a general spin foam model that contain the spin foams relating to all the subgroups.we believe it is important to do this for two reasons .",
    "first , it is good to relate a model to an action second , its good to have all the three subgroups @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 of @xmath0 play a role . because these groups are physically related to particles which are massive , massless and tachyonic . even though the third one is not physical , we donot know what role this type of contribution would play in quantum gravity in future .",
    "if the tachyonic part of our theory is not physical , we want our theory itself predict that , instead of our artificially excluding it . at this point",
    "it is also not clear what role the @xmath9 will play in the theory .",
    "we believe the study of the asymptotic limit @xcite , @xcite , the continuum limit and the inclusion of matter will shed light on this . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the construction of spin foam models only .    in section two",
