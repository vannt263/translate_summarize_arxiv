    "over the past few years _ model order reduction _ has become an indispensable constituent of large scale design or optimization problems . in particular , the _ reduced basis method _ ( rbm ) is perhaps by now one of the most important paradigms for highly complex _",
    "frequent query problems _ involving parameter dependent pdes , see e.g. @xcite . among other things , at least under certain circumstances , modeling errors",
    "are rigorously controlled and can be upgraded if necessary .",
    "while the development of rbms has been a very active area with impressive success stories in by now a variety of important application fields , it is fair to say that a theoretical underpinning of what one might call `` near - optimal performance '' - in a sense to be made precise later - is still confined to a relatively narrow problem class .",
    "the central purpose of this paper is therefore to extend the scope of problems for which rbms can be developed and rigorously proven to perform in that near optimal sense .",
    "the focus of the present work is on performance in terms of the _ accuracy _ offered by the reduced model , roughly speaking , centering around the question how to ensure any certified target tolerance of the reduced model by a possibly small number of reduced basis functions , of course , always insisting on the standard _ offline - online _ division of the overall computational work .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 , @xmath2 , is a family of ( linear ) operators from a hilbert space @xmath3 onto the dual @xmath4 of another hilbert space @xmath5 , depending on parameters @xmath6 from a compact set @xmath7 .",
    "under appropriate conditions on @xmath8 the solution set @xmath9 for the family of operator equations @xmath10 is a compact subset of @xmath3 . in the context of frequent query problems , like steering a functional @xmath11 of the solution towards a target value ,",
    "rbms try to exploit the fact that @xmath12 may be a very thin subset of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , compactness of @xmath12 means that the _ kolmogorov @xmath0-widths _ @xmath13 tend to zero as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is taken from the set of _ all _ @xmath0-dimensional subspaces of @xmath3 and @xmath16 the objective is then to construct ( problem dependent ) subspaces @xmath17 of possibly small dimension @xmath0 such that for a given _ target accuracy _ @xmath18 , say , @xmath19 is _ guaranteed _ to hold .",
    "in particular , this implies that for any @xmath20 and any bounded linear functional @xmath21 , a trivial estimate immediately gives @xmath22 ( which could even be improved by duality arguments , see e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath23 is the @xmath3-orthogonal projection onto @xmath24 .",
    "of course , a key question is how to practically construct spaces @xmath24 warranting for possibly small @xmath0 . a common strategy of essentially all rbms is the following . given @xmath24 , find a _ surrogate _ @xmath25 , @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 holds for some constant @xmath28 independent of @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "here it is crucial that the evaluation of @xmath25 is sufficiently efficient so that the maximization of @xmath25 over @xmath26 is computationally feasible",
    ". then perform the _ greedy algorithm _ * ga * based on this surrogate , as described in algorithm [ alg : greedy ]    set @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31    we have ignored for the moment the fact that the snapshots @xmath32 can , of course , not be computed exactly but only approximately within some sufficiently large but finite dimensional `` truth space '' .    to see whether such a greedy space search produces good reduced models",
    "one can compare them with the `` best possible '' spaces .",
    "clearly , the @xmath0-width @xmath33 from is a _ lower bound _ for the accuracy attainable by any rbm , i.e. , @xmath34 unfortunately , in general it seems to be impossible to compute the precise _ optimal _",
    "subspaces for which the @xmath0-width is attained .",
    "nevertheless , the closer @xmath35 is to @xmath33 the better the choice of @xmath24 .    to see what can be achieved in this regard , recall from @xcite that even when @xmath36 is the _ ideal _ surrogate , in a direct comparison @xmath37 the constant @xmath38 can be as large as @xmath39",
    "nevertheless , the following more favorable results in terms of _ convergence rates _",
    "hold for surrogates that are _ tight _ , i.e. , if in addition to the upper bound it uniformly sandwiches the exact distance .",
    "[ def : tightsurr ] we call the surrogate @xmath25 , _ tight _ if there exist positive constants @xmath40 such that @xmath41 uniformly in @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , we call @xmath42 the _ condition _ of the surrogate @xmath43 .",
    "[ remweakgreedy ] as already observed in @xcite whenever the surrogate is tight , i.e. ) holds , then the snapshots @xmath44 from satisfy the _ weak greedy condition _",
    "@xmath45 where @xmath46 is given by .",
    "the following statements are then readily derived from the results in @xcite .    [ thrates ]",
    "assume that the spaces @xmath24 are obtained through a greedy algorithm * ga * , based on tight surrogates .",
    "then , if @xmath47 , for some @xmath48 or if @xmath49 , for some @xmath50 , one has @xmath51 respectively , where the constants depend on @xmath52 , and @xmath46 with exact specification given in @xcite . moreover , these bounds remain valid up to the tolerance @xmath53 when all computations are carried out within this accuracy .",
    "we call an rbm _ rate - optimal _ if the generated spaces @xmath24 satisfy `` kolmogorov optimal '' bounds of the type .",
    "there are two important points to be drawn from these results that guide the subsequent developments .",
    "the first one is : although dispensing with the ( infeasible ) ideal surrogate @xmath36 , a tight surrogate still ensures that the accuracy provided by the reduced bases is in terms of rates still essentially as good as that of the `` kolmogorov - best '' subspaces .",
    "the second point is _ quantitative_. it is absolutely vital to make sure that the condition @xmath46 stays as small as possible .",
    "in fact , a look at the dependence of the constants in on @xmath46 ( see @xcite ) reveals that the closer @xmath46 is kept to one , the better is the accuracy of the reduced spaces , in comparison with the best spaces , already for a _ small reduced dimension _ , which is at the heart of model reduction .",
    "hence , the central objective of this paper is to develop a rigorous conceptual framework to obtain practically feasible tight surrogates whose _ condition _",
    "@xmath54 is as close to one as possible , in particular , for problem classes for which this is currently not known .      to provide an orientation for subsequent developments the corresponding _ ideal scenario _ and the corresponding basic mechanisms",
    "are briefly recalled in section [ sect1.2 ] .",
    "it is by and large confined to problems that are uniformly elliptic with respect to the parameters .",
    "the perhaps next best understood case is the reduction of a parabolic problem to a sequence of elliptic problems @xcite , where however , the lower bound in - and hence tightness - seems to be missing .",
    "this has been recently significantly improved in @xcite using a space - time variational formulation . moreover ,",
    "important progress has been made in @xcite developing rbms for specific saddle point - hence indefinite - problems such as the stokes system .",
    "in particular , in the present terminology    stability and , as a consequence , tight surrogates are obtained by enriching the velocity spaces by _",
    "supremizers_. more precisely , there are two approaches . for standard affine parameter dependence of the involved bilinear forms",
    "one can determine _ a priori _ an enrichment , depending on the number of terms in the bilinear forms , that ensures that the infinite dimensional inf - sup - constant is preserved , see in @xcite .",
    "since the number of these supremizers is possibly quite large , as an alternative , it is proposed in @xcite to _ adaptively _ add supremizers until a desired inf - sup - stability is reached .",
    "it is observed experimentally that in the tested examples this adaptive enrichment results in an overall much smaller number of stabilizing functions although the actual guaranteed termination of such a procedure has apparently not been discussed .",
    "although termination in the context treated in @xcite is apparent , we shall encounter situations where this is no longer the case .",
    "nevertheless , relating also the stabilizing enrichments to greedy approximations allows us to treat this case as well , see section [ sec : term ] .",
    "although the present paper addresses a rather different problem class the treatment of saddle point problems turns out to be an important point of contact .",
    "in fact , the stabilizing enrichment of the reduced velocity spaces by adding supremizers can be viewed as a special instance of the interior loop of what we call here _ double greedy schemes _ , presented first at a workshop in paris , 2011 @xcite .",
    "the central objective of this paper is in fact to develop rate - optimal rbms - viz .",
    "identify well - conditioned tight surrogates - for a much wider scope of problems , in particular , to those that are at present notoriously not covered by current rbm theory , namely _ transport dominated _ problems .",
    "two model problems are formulated in sections [ ssect : con - diff ] , [ ssect : transport ] , exhibiting increasing levels of obstructions .",
    "we emphasize though that the general methodology presented below is not restricted to those problems at all . a key role in this context",
    "is played by deriving _",
    "stable variational formulations _ for such problems that are necessarily of _ petrov - galerkin _ type .",
    "the main features of this approach , being valid for a wide range of problems including indefinite , unsymmetric and singularly perturbed problems , are shown in section [ sect : stabvar ] .",
    "they can be summarized as follows :    * tight a - posteriori bounds for the truth spaces as well as reduced spaces warrant certification .",
    "in particular , truth and reduced spaces can be upgraded without discarding prior computations , see the robustness results in @xcite . *",
    "while remaining feasible in the sense of an online / offline decomposition through a built in stabilization loop , the scheme automatically gives rise to stability constants that can , in principle , be made arbitrarily close to one , see also and section [ sect : appl ] . *",
    "viewing time as an additional `` spatial '' variable , the results can be applied to time dependent problems through corresponding space - time discretizations , which is one reason to focus on transport problems , see @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the particular variational formulations presented in section [ sect : stabvar ] combined with certain stabilization techniques optimally inherits the analytic structure of the underlying infinite dimensional problem to the reduced model .",
    "section [ sec : dg ] is then devoted to the algorithmic development and analysis of a _",
    "double greedy _ scheme giving rise to rate - optimal rbms .",
    "the theoretical findings are then applied in section [ sect : appl ] to the two model problems concerning convection - diffusion and pure transport equations .",
    "first numerical experiments quantify the results and highlight several particular obstructions .",
    "in section [ sectsaddle ] we apply the ( slightly modified ) scheme to other types of saddle point problems not necessarily stemming from the generation of well - conditioned variational formulations . as a simple consequence we obtain rate - optimality also for the problems considered in @xcite .    to simplify the exposition we write @xmath55 to express that @xmath56",
    "is bounded by some constant multiple of @xmath57 independent on any parameters @xmath58 may depend on .",
    "likewise @xmath59 means @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in all subsequent developments we will be dealing exclusively with _ affine _ parameter dependence , see e.g. @xcite . under this assumption",
    "we insist on the usual division of the computational work into an _",
    "offline _ and _ online _ mode . solving a problem in the full space @xmath3 , which is typically computationally very intense , happens only in offline mode where it is understood that actual computations take place in some sufficiently large but finite dimensional subspace @xmath62 of @xmath3 which",
    "is commonly referred to as the `` truth space '' .",
    "typically @xmath62 is chosen so as to guarantee @xmath63 for some tolerance @xmath53 that is sufficiently small for the application at hand .",
    "the subscript @xmath64 is sometimes supressed when there is no risk of confusion .",
    "the greedy search for the reduced basis functions falls therefore into the offline mode .",
    "this requires evaluating the surrogate for a sufficiently large _ training set _ of parameters which for simplicity we also denote by @xmath65 . in",
    "what follows , we call the surrogate _ feasible _ if each evaluation of the surrogate requires solving only a problem in the small current reduced space @xmath24 .",
    "we sometimes say then that the offline mode is ( computationally offline ) feasible .",
    "likewise , the _ online evaluation _ is called _ feasible _ if each reduced basis approximation of some @xmath66 requires solving only a `` small '' problem of dimension @xmath0 in the reduced space @xmath24 . in this mode solving a `` large '' problem in @xmath62 is prohibited .    note that a feasible surrogate is not allowed to explicitly contain the true solution @xmath66 ( in the truth space ) .",
    "this is why one is essentially forced to resort to _ residuals _ to estimate the true error , which in turn requires a tight _ error - residual _ relation .",
    "the following `` ideal setting '' reveals the basic mechanisms leading to _ residual based _ tight surrogates .    to this end , let @xmath67 be a symmetric uniformly @xmath3-elliptic bilinear form and @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath68 holds uniformly in @xmath2",
    ". for compact @xmath65 one obtains a compact solution set @xmath69 for : given @xmath21 , find @xmath70 such that @xmath71 there are two key properties that ensure rate - optimality in this setting : + * ( mp ) mapping property : * the operator @xmath72 , defined by @xmath73 , @xmath74 , is for each @xmath26 an isomorphism from @xmath3 onto @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 in other words , errors measured in the `` energy norm '' @xmath77 are equivalent to residuals in the dual norm @xmath78 .",
    "+ * ( bap ) best approximation property : * the galerkin projection to the current reduced space , which can be done in online mode , produces , up to constants , a best approximation with respect to the @xmath3-norm .    in fact , denoting by @xmath79 the galerkin - projector onto @xmath24 defined by @xmath80 combining cea s lemma with * mp * provides for @xmath81 @xmath82 thus , * mp * and * bap * imply that the residual based surrogate , defined by , is tight , while the computation of @xmath66 is completely avoided but traded against the cheap computation of the galerkin projection in @xmath24 .",
    "however , the condition @xmath83 of the surrogate ( see ) depends on the _ condition number _ @xmath84 ( see ) of the operator @xmath72 , which should therefore be of moderate size .",
    "finally , feasibility of the surrogate in is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) to be ensured when the parameter dependence of @xmath85 is _ affine _ , see below .",
    "as soon as one leaves the elliptic setting * mp * , * bap * , tightness of residual based surrogates , are no longer for free . in particular , so far _ well - conditioned _ tight surrogates do _ not _ seem to be available yet for many unsymmetric pdes like convection dominated or pure transport problems .",
    "we shall discuss two model problems that bring out several principal obstructions .",
    "the first example concerns convection - diffusion equations for which , in principle , classical variational formulations are available .",
    "the second example concerns pure transport for which a `` natural '' variational formulation is less obvious and for which the parameter dependence of the solutions turns out to be less regular .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the two examples represent two different scenarios regarding the _ spaces _ associated with the bilinear form @xmath85 , an issue that has apparently not been addressed in the rbm context .      as a first example we consider the linear _ convection - diffusion _",
    "equation @xmath86 where for simplicity we assume for now that only the convection @xmath87 depends on a parameter @xmath6 while @xmath88 could be _ arbitrarily small_. we could as well include the viscosity and the reaction term varying in suitable regimes .",
    "its classical weak formulation is @xmath89 it is well known that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 implies _ well - posedness _ of in the sense that the induced operator @xmath93 is an isomorphism , i.e. , there exists for each @xmath2 a unique solution @xmath66 to in @xmath94 .",
    "however , although is still valid , the condition number @xmath95 behaves like the pclet number @xmath96 and hence is inacceptably large for strongly dominating convection . as a consequence , in this case the condition @xmath46 of the corresponding surrogate based on the @xmath97-residual grows with the pclet number .",
    "hence , although such a surrogate is theoretically tight , as long as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is fixed , the condition @xmath46 ( see ) is so large , that , due to the constants in , one can expect essentially no control of the quality of the reduced spaces for very small @xmath100 and moderate @xmath0 .    therefore , we are mainly interested here in a robust treatment of _ arbitrarily _ large pclet numbers @xmath96 which to our knowledge is currently not well covered by rbm methodology .",
    "unfortunately , an easy cure based on the standard ( mesh - dependent ) stabilization methods such as supg ( see e.g. @xcite for a survey ) does not give rise to an error - residual relation that stays independent of the pclet number @xmath101 either .",
    "instead we pursue here a different line based on stabilizing the problem on the _ infinite dimensional _ level which , in particular , involves _ unsymmetric _ variational formulations , i.e. , @xmath85 is viewed as a bilinear form on a pair of ( possibly ) _ different _ and _ parameter dependent _ hilbert spaces @xmath102 , @xmath2 .      in some sense",
    "the situation is even aggrivated when the diffusion vanishes completely as in pure _ parametric transport equations _ forming the core ingredient of boltzmann equations and related kinetic models as well as kinetic formulations of conservation laws .",
    "already the simplest version of a ( stationary ) linear transport equation @xmath103^d,\\quad      p   = p_b , \\quad \\text{on } \\gamma_-(\\mu ) ,    \\label{eq : transport}\\ ] ] will be seen to represent the `` worst scenario '' from the rbm perspective , where , denoting by @xmath104 the outward normal at the point @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the inflow boundary for the given convection vector @xmath6 .",
    "an example of a parameter domain would be the sphere @xmath107 appearing in radiative transfer models , see @xcite .",
    "it will be seen that the two examples differ in a subtle but essential way , in particular , regarding smoothness of the dependence of the solutions on the parameter .",
    "a possible variational formulation of can be found in @xcite . in order to eventually apply the @xmath0-width benchmark",
    ", it is preferable to measure all parameter dependent solutions in a single reference norm .",
    "therefore we employ here a slightly different variational formulation from @xcite : multiplying by a test function and integrating by parts , yields @xmath108 if we now take test functions @xmath109 that vanish on @xmath110 the boundary integral on the left hand side is zero .",
    "furthermore , we may replace the function @xmath111 in the boundary integral on the right hand side by the boundary condition @xmath112",
    "so that we obtain @xmath113 for this variational formulation it is natural to define the function spaces @xmath114 endowed with the norms @xmath115 it is shown in @xcite that the operator @xmath72 induced by @xmath85 , is an isomorphism @xmath116 so that indeed defines a norm .",
    "[ remydiffer ] notice that the spaces @xmath117 differ even as sets for different @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the previous example we must have @xmath118 here .",
    "in the following , we consider general bilinear forms @xmath119 for possibly parameter dependent hilbert spaces @xmath120 and @xmath117 giving rise to what one may call an infinite dimensional _ petrov - galerkin _ formulation where the _ trial space _",
    "@xmath120 generally differs from the _ test space _ @xmath117 .",
    "thus , the operator @xmath72 given by @xmath121 is now viewed as a mapping from @xmath120 to @xmath122 . in accordance with the preceding examples , we shall assume that this operator is actually an _ isomorphism _",
    ", i.e. , the operator equation @xmath123 has for any @xmath124 a unique solution in @xmath120 .",
    "however , @xmath72 may possibly have an unacceptably large @xmath6-dependent condition which can be quantified with the aid of babuska s theorem : if there exist constants @xmath125 such that @xmath126 and for every @xmath127 there exists a @xmath128 such that @xmath129 , then one has @xmath130 .",
    "as in the case of convection dominated convection - diffusion equations @xmath131 could be very large , severely degrading a greedy selection of snapshots in a rbm .",
    "the goal of this subsection is to describe how to `` stabilize '' the problem on the _ infinite dimensional _ level which could be viewed as preconditioning .",
    "the underlying basic principle has been used before in several works for different purposes , see e.g. @xcite . here",
    "our main orientation is taken from @xcite .",
    "we briefly rehash the essential facts in order to bring in an additional _ new _ element , namely the interrelation of _ petrov - galerin _ schemes and _ associated saddle point problems _ , which plays an essential role for eventually constructing well - conditioned tight surrogates .",
    "we begin with collecting a few useful preliminaries .",

    "in essence , in case the finite element truth space does not resolve boundary layers this scheme behaves like a solver of the corresponding transport problem for @xmath661 which is , however , ill - posed when insisting on zero boundary conditions on all of @xmath662 .",

    ", @xmath668 has a nontrivial kernel so that the optimization problem is not uniquely solvable .",
    "one simple remedy is to add the outflow boundary condition as a penalty term : @xmath669 where @xmath670 is a norm for @xmath671 and @xmath672 , see @xcite . practically , this weak enforcement of the outflow boundary condition applied to a subspace @xmath673 has the following effect : typically boundary layers are found at the outflow boundary which are too narrow to be resolved at affordable cost . if @xmath674 is chosen small , then the enforcement of the outflow boundary condition has little weight so that it is almost ignored which , in turn , removes layer artifacts .",
    "if , however , @xmath185 is sufficiently rich so as to resolve layers , @xmath675 becomes so small that the boundary penalty becomes important and the boundary conditions are approximately satisfied , see figure [ fig : condiff-1 ] .",
    "the rationale is that as long as the layer is not resolved the error with respect to conventional norms ( including the supg - norm ) is mostly concentrated in the layer region , which therefore stays , roughly speaking , as large as not realizing the boundary conditions at the outflow boundary at all . putting a small weight on this error contribution actually increases accuracy away from the outflow boundary , see @xcite . putting it in a slightly different way , by allowing more freedom in the outflow boundary layer ,",
    "the @xmath120-norm is changed in such a manner that the error in the boundary layer has very small weight .",
    "this in turn allows one to better control the error away form the layer .    to apply the theory of section [ sec : recipe ] , we define the test space @xmath676    \\|[v , g]\\|_{{\\bar{y}_\\mu}}^2 & : = &   \\|v\\|_{{y_\\mu}}^2 + \\omega \\|g\\|_{{{h_b}}(\\mu)'}^2 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] and the operator @xmath677.\\ ] ] according to the definition of the graph - norm , this yields the norm @xmath678 for the trial space @xmath665 .",

    "a practical stopping criterion would be , for instance , that @xmath738 , or @xmath739 .    an alternative strategy is to apply the double greedy scheme to the defect problem @xmath740 and form @xmath741 as the sum of @xmath742 and",
    "the largest reduced space for the defect problem .",
    "since the relative accuracy to be achieved for the defect problem only needs to meet the constant @xmath743 in one expects that a few steps suffice . since @xmath741 now contains `` complementary '' information @xmath742",
    "is enlarged more effectively than in the first method .",
    "the upshot of these comments is that investing additional computational offline effort is guaranteed to tighten the surrogates and thereby improves the choice of the reduced spaces .",
    "this is in contrast to greedy strategies based on surrogates that are not based on well - conditioned variational formulations and therefore most likely fail to detect the most effective snapshots .",
    "these issues will be addressed in forthcoming work .",
    "since the basis function @xmath744 can now be orthonormalized in @xmath745 and @xmath746 , theorem [ thm - m ] applies and yields the following result .",
    "[ cor - transport ] if @xmath610 from is based on iterative tightening with @xmath747 satisfying for sufficiently small @xmath743 , then the scheme dg-1 using update - inf - sup is rate - optimal for @xmath263 .",
    "we could also reverse the roles of the spaces @xmath748 , choosing @xmath745 as the test space , see @xcite . in this case",
    "the trial spaces would essentially depend on the parameter @xmath6 so that the understanding of the solution set @xmath12 is less clear . on the other hand",
    ", this choice would correspond to the limit of the formulation for vanishing viscosity .",
    "since does not hold we can not apply proposition [ propmb ] to predict a strict a priori bound on the number of stabilization steps in update-@xmath200 or update - inf - sup .",
    "adhering to the notation in section [ sec : greedy ] , we have here @xmath749 , see .",
    "since in the present case @xmath750 is the identity , as pointed out there , the enrichments of the test spaces @xmath213 are are linear combinations of elements of the form @xmath751 where @xmath752 are different most of the time , due to the greedy selection . as a consequence , when @xmath753 , this means that indeed @xmath754 . of course",
    ", the @xmath755-norm may deteriorate when @xmath752 get closer , which however may be offset to some extent by the expectation that these snapshots are most relevant for the stabilization of solutions with nearby parameters .",
    "it is also clear that higher regularity of @xmath560 would indeed ensure sufficient regularity of the @xmath553 ( or @xmath554 ) , independently of @xmath752 and hence allows one to control the constants @xmath756 ( or @xmath562 ) .",
    "this effect is reflected to some extent by the experiments below .",
    "we consider the analog of the convection - diffusion problem with zero diffusion @xmath661 and corresponding boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath757 we employ a truth trial space with mesh size @xmath758 , using discontinuous piecewise bilinear finite elements with proper boundary conditions . to ensure stable truth discretizations ,",
    "the test truth space is comprised of globally continuous piecewise bilinear finite elements , therefore being contained in @xmath759 , on a finer mesh with mesh size @xmath697 to ensure @xmath200-proximality .",
    "recall that the spaces @xmath117 now differ even as sets .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab : transport-1 ] and a reduced basis solution for the angle @xmath760 is given in figure [ fig : transport ] .",
    "specifically , in addition to the dimensions of the trial and test spaces in columns ( 1 ) `` trial '' , ( 2 ) `` test '' , it records the values of the surrogates in column ( 4 ) `` surr '' , the error between the reduced basis solution and the best @xmath178-approximation of the exact solution in the truth space in column ( 6 ) `` rb l2 '' , the error between the reduced basis solution and the truth solution in column ( 5 ) `` rb truth '' , and finally in column ( 7 ) `` surr / err '' the ratio between the computed surrogate and the error in `` rb l2 '' .",
    "all values reflect the worst case over the parameter range .    as pointed out above , unlike the convection - diffusion problem",
    ", the surrogate for the transport problem is not necessarily well - conditioned from the start .",
    "therefore , table [ tab : transport-1 ] contains one column which shows the ratio of the surrogate compared to the true error of the reduced basis approximation , maximized over a sample of the angles with the largest values of the surrogate .",
    "although this is at this point not founded rigorously , we see that this ratio stays uniformly bounded with respect to the size of the reduced basis .",
    "hence it already does reflect the accuracy of the reduced model .",
    "however , the ratio ist not close to one yet , as it would be for a well - conditioned surrogate given by the truth - exact evaluation of the residual corresponding to a well - conditioned variational formulation . to further improve this ratio by approximating the residual more accurately , we resort to iterative tightening as described above .",
    "the results for a single iteration are recorded in table [ tab : transport-2 ] .",
    "it is seen that already after a single run the ratio of the surrogate and the true error between the reduced basis approximation and true solution has become much closer to one .    in agreement with the discussion in section [ sec : greedy ]",
    "the experiments show that a slightly larger number of test basis functions than for the convection - diffusion problem is needed here .",
    "in particular , unlike in the elliptic case non - smooth data ( right hand side , boundary shape , and boundary conditions ) affect the smoothness of the dependence of the solutions on the parameter . in our examples at most a low order polynomial decay of the @xmath0-widths can be expected . according to summary [ greed - summ ] in section [ sec : greedy ] , since the right hand side is actually smooth , we expect that @xmath450 , defined in , that controls the termination of the inner stabilization loop drops below the desired @xmath761 after an acceptable bounded number of steps independent of the dimension of the truth space .",
    "in fact , one observes that the growth of the test basis stays surprisingly moderate .",
    ".numerical results for the transport problem [ eq : ex2 ] , maximal error truth l2 0.000109832 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table[x = dim_trial , y = m_res ] pictures / all - cases-11 ;       table[x = dim_trial , y = m_res ] pictures / all - cases-12 ;",
    "the crucial role of saddle point problems for the generation of well - conditioned variational formulations is apparent from the preceding discussion .",
    "on the other hand , the concepts developed in this context have an immediate bearing on more general saddle point problems of `` classical type '' . by this",
    "we mean ( parameter dependent ) variational formulations e.g. of the stokes system or those arising in mixed formulations and constrained optimization problems . to see this , it is useful to point out the main distinctions between the two settings when considering the following general formulation for parameter dependent bilinear forms @xmath762 , @xmath763 such that for @xmath2 @xmath764 for classical problems the following conditions @xmath765 as well as @xmath766 where @xmath767 are usually met .    in comparison , the specific structure of the `` stabilizing '' saddle point problem is the following .",
    "[ remellip ] @xmath72 is an isomorphism and for @xmath768 one has @xmath769 and condition holds with @xmath770 even on @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , when using the norm @xmath144 on @xmath120 , holds with @xmath146 .",
    "however , on the downside , one may encounter failure of either or .    for the classical problems considered in @xcite one can state the following .",
    "[ remclassical ] the conditions , are both satisfied so that a single reference norm @xmath771 can be used .",
    "hence , that renormation is not necessary for achieving tightness of residual based surrogates which now involve both component spaces @xmath772 which can be evaluated by the standard offline - online decomposition , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that , given and , the validity of the mapping property * mp * and the best approximation property * bap * hinges again on the inf - sup condition @xmath773 for classical problems it is known for @xmath774 , has to be ensured for the truth spaces @xmath775 , @xmath210 through suitably chosen finite element spaces , say , and again need to be ensured by stabilizing strategies for the reduced spaces @xmath633 , @xmath212 .    in view of remark [ remclassical ] ,",
    "both schemes update-@xmath200 and update - inf - sup can be applied . since the spaces",
    "@xmath213 no longer just serve as stabilizers but need to contribute to the target approximation accuracy of the full solution manifold @xmath776:\\,\\,\\mbox{solves}\\,\\ , \\eqref{varprob } , \\",
    ", \\mu\\in\\mathcal{p}\\ } = : \\mathcal{m}_{{y}}\\times \\mathcal{m}_{{x}},\\ ] ] the only changes that need to be incorporated in a slightly modified version * dg-2 * of * dg-1 * are :    * in * algorithm * replace step 5 by : + set @xmath777 i.e. , both component spaces are updated in the outer greedy step . * in * algorithm * step 5 is replaced by + @xmath778 * replace the surrogate by @xmath779 see @xcite .",
    "clearly , under the given assumptions , , @xmath12 is compact . denoting again by @xmath780 the solution components produced by the scheme * dg-2 * and",
    "comparing the greedy errors @xmath781 with the @xmath0-widths @xmath782 and keeping proposition [ propmb ] in mind , we extend the results in @xcite as follows .",
    "the scheme * dg-2 * applied to is under the above assumptions rate - optimal .",
    "the generation of well - conditioned variational formulations for non - coercive or indefinite problems has been proposed as the central ingredient of a general strategy for constructing tight surrogates for rbms also for such problem classes .",
    "in contrast to previous work , well - conditioned tight surrogates are obtained in a feasible way in all settings warranting a near - optimal performance of the corresponding rbm , which does not seem to be achievable with the aid of previously known concepts .",
    "we emphasize that these concepts apply as well to space - time discretizations of unsteady problems ( see @xcite ) offering interesting perspectives with regard to robustly capturing long - term dynamics .",
    "the presented application to two simple model problems is to be viewed as a first proof of concept .",
    "the two examples are to bring out some essential obstructions and raise issues that have so far not been addressed in this context .",
