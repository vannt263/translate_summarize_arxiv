    "solar coronal jets are frequent magnetically channeled narrow eruptions observed in the solar corona @xcite .",

    "x - ray jets are well - studied and imaged by _ yohkoh _  and _",
    "hinode_. most x - ray jets have a lifetime of about 10 minutes , velocities of around 200 km  s@xmath0  and lengths of @xmath1 5 @xmath2 10@xmath3 km  s@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that x - ray jets show a bright point ( also known as jet bright point , jbp ) at an edge of the base during the eruption @xcite .",
    "properties ( e.g. velocities , lifetimes and a jbp ) similar to x - ray jet properties have been seen in euv coronal jets @xcite .",
    "a possible driving mechanism for jet eruptions is explosive magnetic reconnection .",
    "however , the triggering and driving mechanisms are still not fully understood .",
    "some workers have suggested that flux emergence may lead to the jet eruption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "analyzed 20 random coronal jets in polar coronal holes using soft x - ray and euv images and found that those x - ray jets are driven by small - scale filament eruptions .",
    "their study included only near - limb events that therefore lacked adequate magnetic field data , and so the question of what leads to these _ minifilament _ eruptions remained open .    in this letter , we investigate the eruption mechanism of ten random jets in on - disk quiet regions .",

    "figure [ fig2]b shows the minifilament as it was rising slowly .",
    "the jbp starts to brighten at 04:23 ut ( movie2 ) and later the spire becomes visible ( figure [ fig2]c ) .",
    "figures [ fig2](c ) and ( f ) show that the jbp sits at the pre - eruption location of the minifilament .",
    "we do not observe any precursor brightenings at the location of the jbp in aia 1600 and 1700   images .",
    "in all ten events , the jbp brightening appears at the same time in the aia euv images and in the aia 1600   images .",
    "similarly , the other eight jets resulted from eruption of minifilaments .",
    "specifically , each of the jets resulted from the eruption of a minifilament from the site of the jbp .",
    "all the jet - producing eruptions and jbps studied here are similar to typical solar flare eruptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which a flare arcade ( analogous to the jbp ) grows over the neutral line in the wake of the filament eruption .",
    "the minifilaments show a slow - rise , followed by a fast - rise as they erupt ( movie1 and movie2 ) , analogous to many longer - scale filament eruptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we measured the length of the minifilaments , the jet - base widths , the jet speeds and jet durations ( between the start and the maximum extent of the spire ) from the aia 171   images .",
    "all of the measured parameters are given in table [ tab : list ] .",
    "we measured the plane - of - sky speeds of the jets by constructing a height - time plot for each of them .",
    "for the uncertainties , we considered different fits to the height - time trajectories , and estimated the error in the speeds from the measured slopes .",
    "so for our two events above , we observed that j7 moves with a speed of 135 @xmath5 30 km  s@xmath0  over about 12 minutes whereas j9 erupts outward with a speed of 55 @xmath5 5 km  s@xmath0  over about 9 minutes .",
    "figures [ fig1](g - i ) show line - of - sight magnetograms before , during and after the eruption onset of jet j7 .",
    "figure [ fig1]d shows that the minifilament initially resides along a neutral line in the quiet - region magnetic network .",
    "this is a region where positive flux is in the majority and the minifilament runs along the neutral line between majority and minority flux clumps ( shown with yellow arrows in figure [ fig1]g ) .",
    "we followed these positive and negative flux clumps before eruption and observed that they converged ( see figure [ fig1](g - i ) and movie3 ) .",
    "the yellow arrows in figure [ fig1](g ) point to positive and negative clumps that converge , merge and mostly cancel leading up to the minifilament eruption .    to examine the evolution of the magnetic flux",
    "quantitatively we measured the negative flux of the jet region ( j7 ) , bounded by the white box of figure [ fig1]h .",
    "we measured only the negative flux because it is easy to isolate the patch of negative polarity .",
    "we carefully checked that there were no negative - flux flows across the boundary of the box .",
    "figure [ fig3]a shows the negative flux values , integrated over the selected region ( white box of figure [ fig1]h ) , as a function of time .",
    "the negative flux continuously decreases with time , which is clear evidence of flux cancellation at the neutral line of the minifilament . the dashed line in figure [ fig3]a marks the eruption time , i.e. when we observe brightening in the euv images ( see movie1 ) and the minifilament starts to lift off .",
    "to further display the flux convergence and cancellation , we created an hmi time - distance image ( @xmath1 18 hours , figure [ fig3]b ) along the red dashed line of figure [ fig1]h .",
    "one can clearly see that both polarities approach the neutral line , and eventually cancel with each other just before the eruption ( at 03:27 ut , red line in figure [ fig3]b ) .",
    "the cancellation of the two clumps continues on even after the jet eruption ( movie3 ) .",
    "figure [ fig2](g - i ) shows the magnetic flux arrangement for jet j9 .",
    "the minifilament initially resides along the neutral line that runs between a clump of majority black flux and a clump of minority white flux at one end . both clumps ( shown with the yellow arrows in figure [ fig2]g ) merged and mostly cancelled with each other ( see movie4 ) . for this jet",
    "we mainly focus on the changes in the positive ( white ) flux , which is the minority flux for this case , because it is more isolated : its evolution is easy to follow and measure .",
    "the plot in figure [ fig3]c shows the evolution of the positive flux for @xmath1 6 hours .",
    "the flux continuously decreased through the time ( @xmath1 04:23 ut ) of the appearance of the jbp at the pre - eruption site of the minifilament .",
    "this is clear evidence of flux cancellation at the location of minifilament leading to the eruption .",
    "the minifilament starts to lift off before the jet - spire onset .",
    "the time - distance image in figure [ fig3]d shows the convergence and cancellation of the jet - base polarities ( figure [ fig1]h ) for @xmath1 12 hours . as the negative flux cancels and disappears , the jet eruption is triggered at 03:50 ut .",
    "similarly , we tracked the evolution of magnetic flux in all eight other jet regions , and compared that evolution with the minifilament eruption onset time and find flux cancellation in each case .",
    "we estimated the percentage flux reduction from well before to after each of the ten events by calculating the flux content of the minority polarity flux clumps 5 - 6 hours before and immediately ( 0 - 1 hours ) after the jet eruption ( table [ tab : list ] ) .",
    "we estimated the ( 1@xmath7 ) uncertainty in flux decrease using images of the 5-min cadence flux values over the 1 hour windows ( 5 - 6 hours before and 0 - 1 hours after the eruption ) .",
    "these uncertainties are listed in table [ tab : list ] .",
    "we find that the triggering mechanism for all ten jet eruptions is evidently flux cancellation in the manner of our two example jets .",
    "this is consistent with the idea of other workers , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , that flux convergence and cancellation plays an important role in small - scale filament eruptions . in those listed studies , the small - scale filaments are smaller than typical solar filaments but larger than our minifilaments",
    "we have examined in detail ten randomly - found on - disk quiet region jets observed by _",
    "sdo_/aia and _ sdo_/hmi .",
    "they appear to be typical coronal jets , and have these properties : ( a ) in each pre - jet jet base there was cool transition region material , a minifilament , consistent with recent findings of @xcite ; ( b ) the jets shoot out from the solar surface with an average speed of 100 @xmath5 20 km  s@xmath0 ; ( c ) the average duration of the studied jets is 12 minutes ; ( d ) the average jet - base width is 17000 @xmath5 600 km ; ( e ) the average length of the minifilament is 18 @xmath2 10@xmath8 km , which is comparable to the jet - base width . in all cases",
    ", we observed a jbp at the neutral line from which the minifilament erupted .",
    "the jet - spire widths grew to about the width of the jet base ; this is similar to what @xcite found for their blowout jets , based on x - ray observations .",
    "the observed jet speeds and durations are somewhat slower and shorter than those obtained for quiet region x - ray jets by @xcite ( @xmath1 125 km  s@xmath0 , 65 minutes ) .",
    "our jet durations are nearly the same as the average lifetime ( @xmath1 20 minutes ) of euv jets reported by @xcite , and similar to that of the x - ray coronal hole jets of @xcite ( @xmath1 10 minutes ) .",
    "our minifilament lengths are @xmath1 2 times longer than those of @xcite ( @xmath1 8 @xmath2 10@xmath8 km ) ; we measured the total curvilinear length along the minifilament body for our quiet region minifilaments before eruption , while they measured the projected length of polar coronal hole minifilaments during eruption .",
    "the minifilament eruptions are similar to many large filament eruptions , in showing slow - rise followed by fast - rise .",
    "the minifilaments initially lie on the magnetic neutral lines between the majority and minority flux and they erupt during flux cancellation at the neutral line .",
    "magnetic flux cancellation is evidently the triggering mechanism in the studied jet eruptions ( and evidently works in the way proposed by @xcite for larger filament eruptions ) .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows a schematic sketch based on our jet observations . in figure",
    "[ fig4]a , a smaller ( explosive ) bipole ( on right hand side ) is next a larger bipole ( left hand side ) , where the smaller bipole contains a sheared and twisted field that holds a minifilament .",
    "the minifilament ( blue ) initially sits between the patches of majority positive flux and minority negative flux .",
    "the field immediately above ( black loops in ( a ) ) is an overlying pre - eruption arcade .",
    "initially , the smaller bipole s footpoints are well separated from each other . in ( b ) and ( c ) , we show that both polarities are approaching ( and canceling ) each other ( see figures [ fig3]b , d ) .",
    "the resulting highly - sheared filament field eventually becomes unstable due to flux cancellation at the neutral line and erupts outward , resulting in internal reconnection in the erupting field ( lower star in ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "the jbp is the lower product of the internal reconnection , and is shown as low - lying ( red ) flare loop in ( b ) at the pre - eruption location of the minifilament . as it erupts , the outer envelope of the erupting minifilament field reconnects ( known as external / interchange reconnection ) with the surrounding far - reaching coronal field above the large bipole ( upper star in b and c ; from aia images we know that the surrounding - coronal field is often a far - reaching loop rather than truly open ) .",
    "the external reconnection results in two new connections : the red closed loop in ( c ) over the large bipole and the red open field line , which guides along it the minifilament plasma that appears as part of the jet spire . we observe brightenings in euv images ( figures [ fig1]e and [ fig2]e ) from the external reconnection at the far ends of the red closed loops that are newly formed from the reconnection ( see figures [ fig1]b , [ fig2]b and [ fig4]c ) .",
    "in summary , we report observations of ten random on - disk solar quiet region jets .",
    "we address the magnetic cause of the driving eruptions .",
    "our observations show that in each case a minifilament initially resides at a neutral line inside the jet - base region , and flux cancellation at that neutral line triggers the jet - driving minifilament eruption .",
