    "= 15 cm    ignoring the for our rules irrelevant column immediately to the left of the particle , the configuration of figure  [ ts2](e ) is essentially the same as that of figure  [ ts](b ) . to further move the particle we can thus refer to the rules given in figure  [ ts2 ]",
    "that is , if the column immediately to the right of the white column of height @xmath260 has height @xmath261 ( corresponding to the configuration of figure  [ ts2](a ) with @xmath262 ) the particle can not move any further . similarly , if the column immediately to the right of the white column of height @xmath260 has height @xmath263 ( corresponding to the configuration of figure  [ ts2](b ) with @xmath264 and @xmath262 ) the particle can not move any further .",

    "having introduced all necessary moves we come to the main propositions of this section    [ prm ] each non - minimal configuration can be obtained from one and only one minimal configuration by letting the particles carry out elementary moves in the following order :    * particle @xmath253 moves prior to @xmath267 if @xmath268 . * particle @xmath269 moves prior to @xmath253 if @xmath270 .    to prove this let us assume that we have completed the motion of all particles of charge less than @xmath250 and all particles @xmath269 with @xmath270 , and that we are currently moving the particle @xmath253 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath271 , the lattice path still corresponds to the minimal path .    now note that in moving the particle @xmath253 , we never create a local configuration in which the sum of the height of two consecutive columns is greater than @xmath250 , see the free motion and the figures  [ ts](a)(b ) and [ ts2](c)(e ) . since we have not moved any of the particles of charge greater than @xmath250 , this means that to the right of @xmath272 no two consecutive columns have summed heights greater than @xmath250 . , the configurations of figure  [ ts](d ) and figure  [ ts2](b ) in fact never arise . ] also note that as soon as @xmath253 meets two columns immediately to its right whose summed heights equal @xmath250 , @xmath253 can not move any further , see figures  [ ts](c ) and  [ ts2](a ) .",

    "we either have the mirror image of figure  [ ts](c ) ( in case @xmath274 ) or ( d ) ( in case @xmath275 ) .",
    "neither of these configurations allows for further reversed moves .",
    "the above , however , gives a general procedure for reducing each non - minimal path to a minimal one by simply reversing the rules of motion in the proposition .",
    "that is , we first scan the path for all particles of charge @xmath54 , by locating all occurrence of two consecutive columns of summed heights @xmath54 . from left",
    "to right these label the particles @xmath276 to @xmath277 . applying the previous reasoning with @xmath278 , we can first move @xmath276 back using reversed moves , than @xmath279 , et cetera , until all particles of charge @xmath54 have taken their `` minimal position '' .",
    "repeating this for the particles of charge @xmath280 , then the particles of charge @xmath281 , et cetera , each non - minimal path reduces to a unique minimal path .    as an example to the above , for the path of figure  [ latpath ] the shaded regions mark the ( two ) particles with largest charge ( = 8) . moving them back using the reversed motion ,",
    "the leftmost particle being moved first , we end up with the path shown in figure  [ redpath ] , in which now the ( three ) particles with next - largest charge have been marked .",
    "we leave it to the reader to further reduce the path to obtain the minimal path of content @xmath282 .",
    "= 13 cm    the elementary moves and the reversed moves are clearly reversible . if a particle of charge @xmath250 has made an elementary move changing a path from @xmath102 to @xmath283 , we can always carry a reversed move going from @xmath283 back to @xmath102 .",
    "since each path can be reduced to a unique minimal path using the reversed moves by carrying out the rules of motion of proposition  [ prm ] in reversed order , we have thus established that using the rules of motion we can generate each non - minimal path uniquely from a minimal path . hence the proposition is proven .",

    "it is in fact interesting to note that unlike our proof for the character identities of the unitary minimal models  @xcite , the general case here does not require the introduction of additional `` boundary particles '' .",
    "first let us consider the general @xmath196 case , with @xmath145 .",
    "this implies that the height @xmath305 of the last column of the lattice paths is no longer free to take any of the values @xmath306 , but is bound by @xmath307 . for the particles of charge less or equal to @xmath308 this does not impose any new restrictions on the maximal number of moves @xmath292 can make . for @xmath309 however , @xmath291 in ( [ mt2 ] ) has to be decreased by @xmath310 .",

    "now we use the induction assumption on the term within the curly braces , and the second symmetry relation of ( [ qs ] ) on the first term of the right - hand side .",
    "this yields @xmath406 expanding the sum , all but two terms on the left - hand side cancel , yielding the right - hand side .",
    "finally we have to show equation  ( [ qrec ] ) of proposition  [ pqr2 ] to be true .",
    "we approach this problem indirectly and will in fact show that the right - hand side of ( [ qrec ] ) can be transformed into the right - hand side of ( [ frec ] ) by multiple application of the tautologies  ( [ taut ] ) and the symmetries ( [ qs ] ) . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the case @xmath54 and @xmath102 even , and replace @xmath16 in ( [ frec ] ) and ( [ qrec ] ) by @xmath216 .",
    "the other choices for the parity of @xmath54 and @xmath102 follow in analogous manner , and the details will be omitted .      the proof that this equals the right - hand side of ( [ frec ] ) ( with @xmath16 replaced by @xmath216 and @xmath102 by @xmath407 ) breaks up into two independent steps ,",
    "both of which will be given as a lemma .",
    "first , we have                the proof of this is simple .",
    "first we apply the tautology ( [ taut ] ) to the term within the curly braces , yielding @xmath413 after separating the @xmath414 term in the first and the @xmath415 term in the second term within the curly braces , we change the summation variable @xmath416 in the sum over the second term within the braces .",
    "this results in @xmath417 & & \\hspace{3.5 cm } +   \\left .",
    "q^l \\mult{l}{kl - a-\\case{1}{2}(m - m+\\ell+1)-1}{m+1}{k } \\right\\ } =   f_{\\ell+1}(m , a).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the proof of the lemmas  [ p1 ] and [ p2 ] readily follows from lemma  [ p3 ] . to prove lemma  [ p1 ] , note that the top - line of ( [ eq1 ] ) is nothing but @xmath418 .",
    "since this is equal to @xmath419 , we get @xmath420 applying equation ( [ t2 ] ) with @xmath400 replaced by @xmath421 , to the the second sum , we simplify to equation ( [ ep1 ] ) thus proving our lemma .",
    "to prove lemma  [ p2 ] , we apply the first symmetry relation of ( [ qs ] ) to all @xmath5-multinomials in the bottom - two lines of ( [ eq1 ] ) . after changing @xmath422 in the second line and @xmath423 in the third line ,",
    "the last two lines of ( [ eq1 ] ) combine to @xmath424 with @xmath425 .",
    "this we recognize as @xmath426 replacing the first term by @xmath427 , gives @xmath428 applying equation ( [ t2 ] ) with @xmath400 replaced by @xmath429 and @xmath163 by @xmath430 , to the first sum , this simplifies to @xmath431 finally using the symmetry ( [ qs ] ) , recalling the definition of @xmath432 and changing @xmath422 , we get equation ( [ ep2 ] ) .",
