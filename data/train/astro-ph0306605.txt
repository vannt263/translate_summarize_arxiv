    "acquisition of a stable atmosphere is a prerequisite for the emergence and expansion of life on terrestrial planets , within the solar system and beyond .",

    "noble gases convey important clues for deciphering the origin of the major volatile elements involved in life . indeed",
    ", they span a large range of atomic masses , are chemically inert , and have many isotopes ( ozima and podosek 1983 ) .",
    "to understand the origin of the terrestrial atmosphere one must understand which processes and which sources contributed to its formation . despite its close proximity , the origin of the terrestrial atmosphere is one of the most puzzling enigmas in the planetary sciences ( hunten 1993 , marty and dauphas 2002 ) .",
    "atmospheric noble gases ( ozima and podosek 1983 ) are depleted relative to solar composition ( pepin 1991 , table 1 and fig .",
    "this depletion depends in first approximation on the mass , the light gases being more depleted and isotopically fractionated than the heavy ones .",
    "such a trend is observed in meteorites ( mazor _ et al .",
    "_ 1970 , table 1 and fig . 1 ) and it seems that the terrestrial atmosphere was derived from solar composition by some form of mass fractionation .",
    "however , this simple picture can not explain the abundance and isotopic composition of atmospheric xenon .",
    "if the simple mass fractionation model was valid , we would expect that heavy noble gases be less depleted and less fractionated than light ones .",
    "xenon ( atomic weight 131.30 ) should be less depleted and less fractionated than krypton ( atomic weight 83.80 ) . actually , the opposite is observed .",
    "xenon is depleted in the terrestrial atmosphere by a factor of @xmath0 relative to solar composition while krypton is only depleted by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "likewise , xenon isotopes are fractionated by 38.0 @xmath2 relative to solar while krypton isotopes are only fractionated by 7.6 @xmath2 . despite being heavier , xenon is more depleted and isotopically fractionated than krypton .",
    "this is known as the `` missing xenon '' paradox ( pepin 1991 , tolstikhin and onions 1994 ) .",
    "the earth is not the only terrestrial planet having a `` missing xenon '' problem . on mars , xenon is also more depleted and more fractionated than what is expected ( owen _ et al .",
    "_ 1977 , swindle _",
    "_ 1986 , pepin 1991 ) .",
    "it is important to note that martian xenon was apparently derived from the solar wind component sw - xe ( swindle and jones 1997 , mathew _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , while terrestrial xenon was derived from a hypothetical nebular component u - xe ( pepin and phinney 1978 , pepin 1991 , pepin 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , the apparent similarity between the terrestrial and martian atmosphere should not be regarded as evidence for similarity of sources but rather as evidence for similarity of processes .",
    "two categories of models have been envisioned for fractionating xenon isotopes .",
    "one assumes that the earth accreted from porous planetesimals ( ozima and nakazawa 1980 , zahnle _ et al .",
    "_ 1990a , ozima and zahnle 1993 ) . in these planetesimals ,",
    "gravitational separation of adsorbed nebular gases would have resulted in mass fractionation of trapped volatiles .",
    "this model fails to explain why light and heavy noble gases in the mantle are less fractionated than their atmospheric counterpart ( honda _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , caffee _ et al .",
    "it also fails to explain why xenon in the martian atmosphere is fractionated from sw - xe while terrestrial xenon is fractionated from u - xe ( pepin 2000 ) and why unfractionated solar xenon is present in the martian mantle ( mathew and marti 2001 ) .",
    "finally , it can not reproduce the observed abundance and isotopic composition of light noble gases in the terrestrial atmosphere ( ozima and zahnle 1993 ) .",
    "the second category of models assumes that a massive gas envelope was lost to space on earth or planetesimals ( zahnle and kasting 1986 , sasaki and nakazawa 1988 , hunten _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 , zahnle _ et al .",
    "_ 1990b , pepin 1991 , 1992 , 1997 , hunten 1993 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the rapid escape of a light gas would have exerted an aerodynamic drag on heavier gases .",
    "the balance between the upward aerodynamic drag and the downward gravitational attraction resulted in a mass - dependent loss of noble gases .",
    "a massive hydrogen atmosphere could have been acquired by capture of nebular gases or could have resulted from the reduction or photodissociation of water .",
    "the appropriate energy could have been deposited in the atmosphere as extreme ultraviolet radiation from the young evolving sun or as gravitational energy released during impacts .    for explaining the missing xenon paradox",
    ", both models require that the fractionated gases be mixed with a source having low xe / kr ratio and unfractionated isotopic ratios .",
    "the two possible sources are the mantle and comets .",
    "the xe / kr ratio and xenon isotopic composition of the upper mantle are very close to those of the atmosphere ( moreira _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , table 1 and fig . 5 ) and it is unclear whether volatiles degassed from the earth could have had the low xe / kr ratio and unfractionated isotopic ratios required by some models ( pepin 1991 , 1992 , 1997 , tolstikhin and onions 1994 ) . the noble gas composition of comets can be inferred from laboratory experiments ( laufer _ et al .",

    "an attractive feature revealed by experiments is that noble gases trapped in amorphous water ice exhibit a clear depletion in xe relative to kr ( owen _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , bar - nun and owen 1998 ) . in other words ,",
    "the xe / kr ratio is lower than the solar ratio ( note that this would not be true if noble gases were trapped in crystalline ice as clathrate hydrates , iro _ et al .",
    "this important observation prompted owen and bar - nun ( 1992 ) and zahnle _ et al . _",
    "( 1990a ) to suggest that the atmospheres of the terrestrial planets represented the mixture of an internal component trapped in rocks and an external component delivered by icy planetesimals .",
    "condensation of noble gases at low temperature in the protosolar nebula is not expected to create large isotopic fractionation ( pepin 1992 ) .",
    "laboratory experiments seem to support the view that if any , the fractionation is small for heavy noble gases ( notesco _ et al .",
    "it is assumed here that the noble gas isotopic composition of comets is solar .    as discussed previously , any mass fractionation on the early earth",
    "would have resulted in a high xe / kr ratio and highly fractionated ratios in the residual atmosphere .",
    "an appealing possibility is that this residual atmosphere was mixed with cometary material having a low xe / kr ratio and unfractionated isotopic ratios ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the resulting atmosphere would have a near solar xe / kr ratio , almost unfractionated krypton , and highly fractionated xenon ( fig .",
    "this is exactly what is observed on earth and forms the `` missing xenon '' paradox .",
    "the idea that the terrestrial atmosphere has a dual origin ( dauphas 2003 ) , being a mixture between a fractionated atmosphere and cometary material , is the basis of this work .",
    "note that the results presented in this contribution critically depend on the experimentally observed depletion of xenon relative to krypton when trapped in amorphous water ice .",
    "ascribing a realistic environment to the fractionation episode ( stage 1 ) is difficult .",
    "a few observations can be made that shed some light on this stage .",
    "the first observation is that , contrary to the earth and mars , asteroids lack the large isotopic fractionation observed for xenon ( mazor _ et al .",
    "this indicates that this fractionation must be closely related to the formation of terrestrial planets .",
    "second , the mantle stable isotopic composition is distinct from , yet very close to , the atmospheric composition ( moreira _ et al . _ 1998 ) .",
    "this suggests that active exchange occurred between the mantle and the atmosphere through degassing or recycling .",
    "third , some radiogenic nuclides produced in the mantle are present in the atmosphere ( ozima and podosek 1983 ) , implying that part of the atmosphere was degassed from the mantle .",
    "fourth , the xenon isotopic composition of the martian atmosphere is severely fractionated while that of the martian mantle is not ( mathew and marti 2001 ) , supporting the view that fractionation occurred at the end of planetary accretion .",
    "fifth , martian xenon was derived from sw - xe while terrestrial xenon was derived from u - xe ( swindle and jones 1997 , mathew _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , pepin 2000 ) .",
    "this suggests that fractionation of xenon isotopes did not occur on planetesimals or comets .",
    "the most likely scenario is blowoff of a transient atmosphere at the end of planetary growth . because of modeling uncertainties , it is difficult to know what is the appropriate fractionation law to apply . instead , one may use a phenomenological model such as the generalized power law ( marchal _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) which is written , @xmath3 where r is the fractionated ratio of the nuclides @xmath4 and @xmath5 , r is the initial ratio , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are free parameters .",
    "an equivalent formulation of this law is @xmath8 , with @xmath9 an arbitrary constant .",
    "it is assumed that , prior to mass fractionation , noble gases were present in solar proportions ( @xmath10 , with @xmath11 a constant ) .",
    "the concentration @xmath12 of @xmath4 at the end of stage 1 can thus be related to the solar concentration @xmath13 through , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an arbitrary constant ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the concentration of @xmath4 at the end of stage 1 in the phenomenological model is governed by three parameters , @xmath15 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "after or during this fractionation episode , the earth may have received contributions from comets ( stage 2 ) .",
    "accretion of icy planetesimals by the earth may have occurred in the main stage of planetary growth or might have been part of the late veneer .",
    "the late veneer refers to the material accreted by the earth after formation of the moon and segregation of the terrestrial core .",
    "as illustrated by the lunar cratering record , the bombardment intensity of the earth was higher in the past than it is at present ( chyba 1990 , 1991 ) . the high and unfractionated abundances of noble metals in the terrestrial mantle ( kimura _ et al .",
    "_ 1974 , jagoutz _ et al .",
    "_ 1979 ) are best explained if these elements were delivered to the mantle after metal / silicate segregation .",
    "it is thus estimated that the earth accreted @xmath17 kg of asteroids and comets after differentiation of the core ( dauphas and marty 2002 ) , which is known to have occurred while the short - lived nuclide @xmath18hf ( @xmath19 ma ) was still alive , within approximately 30 ma of solar system formation ( dauphas _ et al .",

    "the contribution of cometary material is then , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a scaling factor defined as @xmath24 , m@xmath25 being the mass of comets accreted by the earth .",
    "the terrestrial atmosphere ( @xmath26 ) is the superposition of the fractionation episode ( stage 1 ) and the cometary accretion ( stage 2 ) , @xmath27 the five parameters of the model are @xmath15 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath23 , and t@xmath25 .",

    "indeed , he is continuously lost to space and rn isotopes are radiogenic and radioactive with short half - lives . in addition , only two isotopes of each element provide independent information on the mass fractionation .",

    "can be seen as reproducing the positions ( @xmath32 ) and derivatives ( @xmath31 ) of the `` noble gas curve '' for neon , argon , krypton , and xenon in the abundance versus mass space .    at present",
    ", the dominant fraction of neon , argon , krypton , and xenon resides in the atmosphere ( dauphas and marty 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the composition of the atmosphere ( ozima and podosek 1983 ) approximates the composition of the earth as a whole .",
    "magmas formed at mid - ocean ridges bear important information on the composition of the shallow mantle .",
    "the @xmath33 concentration of the mantle can be calculated ( dauphas and marty 2002 , marty and dauphas 2003 ) using the observed degassing @xmath34 flux ( 1000 mol a@xmath35 ) , the rate of oceanic crust formation ( 20 km@xmath36 a@xmath35 ) , and the degree of partial melting ( 10 % ) . the mantle @xmath37he concentration is thus estimated to be @xmath38 mol g@xmath35 .",
    "note that this calculation depends on the assumption that the present @xmath37he flux represents a reliable estimate of the time averaged flux .",
    "the abundances of the other noble gases can then be computed using elemental ratios normalized to helium ( moreira _ et al .",
    "because of limited precision and large air contamination , the isotopic compositions of mantle noble gases are not yet firmly established . within uncertainties ,",

    "_ 1998 , moreira _",

    "the neon isotopic composition of the mantle is important as it serves as a fiducial value for deriving the composition for other noble gases ( moreira _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . following moreira _",
    "( 1998 ) and trieloff _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) , it is assumed that the @xmath39 ratio of the shallow mantle is 12.5 .",
    "the actual value might be higher , up to 13.8 , the solar ratio ( ballentine _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , yokochi and marty 2003 ) .",
    "the xenon isotopic composition can be derived from the @xmath40 correlation measured in co@xmath41 well gases ( caffee _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) and the inferred @xmath42 excess of the mantle ( moreira _ et al .",
    "the mantle @xmath43 ratio is thus estimated to be 0.476 .",
    "if solar composition was known with great accuracy , the abundances of every isotope could be used to constrain the curvature of the mass fractionation law .",
    "this idea was applied to xenon isotopes ( hunten _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) but it relies on the debatable assumption that u - xe represents the initial nebular composition ( pepin and phinney 1978 , pepin 1991 , 2000 ) .",
    "the enigmatic u - xe is a nebular component distinct from the present solar composition .",
    "it has been first derived theoretically by pepin and phinney ( 1978 ) and it is used here as the initial atmospheric composition prior to fractionation .",
    "a recent search for its presence in achondrites was inconclusive ( busemann and eugster 2002 ) .",
    "as stated previously , it is assumed here that the isotopic composition of noble gases in comets is that of the ambient nebula .",
    "laboratory experiments indicate that at 30 k , the normalized abundance of neon is depleted by a factor of @xmath44 relative to its initial value , and that at 50 k , it is depleted by more than a factor of @xmath45 ( laufer _ et al .",
    "the amount of argon trapped in ice follows a power dependence on the trapping temperature ( bar - nun _",
    "_ 1988 , bar - nun and owen 1998 , owen and bar - nun 1995a ) . using experimental data ( bar - nun and owen 1998 ) , the solar ar / o ratio ( anders and grevesse 1989 ) , and the oxygen concentration in cometary ice ( delsemme 1988 , marty and dauphas 2002 ) , it is straightforward to calculate the approximate argon concentration in comets , @xmath46 mol g@xmath35 , with t@xmath25 in k. using the calculated argon concentration and the measured enrichment factors for heavy noble gases ( owen _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , bar - nun and owen 1998 ) , it is then possible to estimate the composition of comets for kr and xe .",
    "the enrichment factors were measured for a finite set of trapping temperatures and they have been interpolated between measurements assuming a power dependence on t@xmath25 . the calculated composition of comets is given for a variety of trapping temperatures in table 1 .",
    "recent trapping experiments indicate that the deposition rate affects the amount of gas trapped in amorphous water ice ( notesco _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) , strengthening the need for measurements of noble gas concentrations in real comets .",

    ", comets comprise a significant fraction of earth s impacting population , at least on the order of a few percent ( shoemaker _ et al .",
    "the integrated mass fraction is much lower , implying that the dynamics of asteroids and comets changed with time . knowing the mass of comets accreted by the earth and their composition , it is then straightforward to compute their contribution to major terrestrial volatiles . as illustrated in table 5 , the cometary contribution to the terrestrial inventory of hydrogen , carbon , and nitrogen must have been negligibly small .",
    "if the atmosphere was derived from mantle degassing , this implies that comets were not delivered as a late veneer but were accreted during the main stage of planetary accretion . note that cometary accretion could have been contemporaneous with fractionation of a transient atmosphere ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "following different lines of evidence , owen _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) estimated that the formation temperature of the comets that impacted the earth must have been around 50 k , very close to the value previously derived .",
    "this is not unexpected because the `` missing xenon '' paradox requires a source with a low xe / kr ratio , and the cometary xe / kr ratio is subsolar for a narrow range of trapping temperatures centered around 50 k ( owen _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , bar - nun and owen 1998 ) .",
    "simulation of cometary trajectories in the early solar system indicates that the comets that impacted the earth must have originated beyond the orbit of uranus ( morbidelli _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , in a region of the nebula where the temperature was probably lower than 70 k ( yamamoto 1985 ) .",
    "this upper - limit is consistent with the value advocated in the present contribution .    as discussed in section 3 ,",
    "trapping conditions such as the deposition rate affect the amount of gas trapped in amorphous water ice ( notesco _ et al .",
    "the mass and temperature of comets derived here using high deposition rates ( owen _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , bar - nun and owen 1998 ) probably represent upper - limits .",
    "the contribution of comets formed below 55 k to the terrestrial inventory of major volatiles must have been negligibly small ( table 5 ) .",
    "this result agrees with the marked difference between the deuterium to protium ratio of the earth and that of comets ( balsiger _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , eberhardt _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , meier _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , bockele - morvan _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , dauphas _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) , and the noble gas and noble metal concentrations of the earth ( dauphas and marty 2002 ) .",
    "if comets did not deliver major volatiles , how did the earth acquire its oceans ?",
    "water could have been delivered by a late asteroidal veneer ( dauphas _ et al .",
    "some meteorite groups contain large amounts of water with the appropriate d / h ratio ( kerridge 1985 ) .",
    "primitive carbonaceous chondrites contain 5 - 10 % water .",
    "the mass of the late veneer accreted after core formation is @xmath17 kg .",
    "hence , accretion of asteroidal material could have delivered @xmath105 kg of water .",
    "this range encompasses the mass of terrestrial oceans , @xmath106 kg .",
    "although appealing , this idea has difficulties .",
    "first , the osmium isotopic composition of the mantle is different from that of carbonaceous chondrites ( meisel _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , 2001 , walker _",
    "if noble metals in the terrestrial mantle were entirely delivered by the late veneer , this would imply that carbonaceous asteroids did not impact the earth in a late accretionary stage .",
    "note however that the osmium isotopic composition of the mantle is reconcilable with a late carbonaceous veneer , if noble metals delivered to the mantle were mixed with the fractionated residue left over after core formation ( dauphas _ et al . _",
    "the recent finding in meteorites of ruthenium isotope anomalies ( chen _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) , an element which was essentially all delivered to the earth after core formation , may ultimately help to solve the question of the nature of the late veneer . a second difficulty arises with noble gases",
    ". indeed , accretion by the earth of water from a late carbonaceous veneer would have probably delivered too much xenon of inappropriate isotopic composition ( owen and bar - nun 1995a , dauphas _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) .    owen and bar - nun ( 1995a ,",
    "b ) and delsemme ( 1999 ) suggested that comets formed in the jupiter region of the nebula delivered major volatiles .",
    "these comets would have formed at comparatively high temperature ( 100 k ) . as a consequence",
    ", they would have trapped less noble gases and would exhibit a lower d / h ratio due to exchange with protosolar hydrogen .",
    "xenon would certainly be depleted in such comets but it seems unlikely that this depletion attained the required level for delivering water without disturbing noble gases .",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) modeled comet trajectories in the nascent solar system .",
    "they concluded that the contribution of cometesimals from the jupiter zone to the terrestrial water inventory was negligible .",
    "unless one calls on hypothetical impactors having high h@xmath41o / xe ratios , late accretion by the earth of asteroidal and cometary material does not provide a straightforward explanation to the origin of the terrestrial oceans .",
    "this may indicate that major volatiles and noble gases were decoupled at some stage of planetary formation .",
    "hydrogen , carbon , and nitrogen form reactive compounds that can interact with the geosphere . during or at the end of planetary growth , major volatiles could have been trapped in the earth ( matsui and abe 1986 , morbidelli _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , abe _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) while inert noble gases would have accumulated in a transient atmosphere .",
    "this transient atmosphere would have been lost to space as a result of impact erosion and continuous escape .",
    "differential retention of gases during planetary growth therefore provides an elegant solution to the observed decoupling between inert and reactive gases , and explains why the terrestrial h@xmath41o / xe ratio is so high .",
    "when and where did the fractionation and accretion stages occur ?",
    "although debated , the composition of the mantle bears important information on this issue .",
    "the following discussion relies on an incomplete and uncertain description of the mantle composition and noble gas behavior .",
    "it is therefore highly speculative and should be regarded as such .",
    "the silicate earth can be divided into two reservoirs ( allgre _ et al .",
    "_ 1986/87 , marty and dauphas 2002 ) .",
    "one was severely outgassed , resulting in highly radiogenic isotopic ratios .",
    "this reservoir is sampled at mid - ocean ridges and represents the shallow part of the mantle .",
    "the other was much less outgassed and is sampled by ascending mantle plumes from the deep earth .",
    "the composition of the shallow mantle is well documented while that of the deep earth is to a large extent unknown .",
    "the shallow mantle apparently exhibits the same `` missing xenon '' paradox as the atmosphere ( section 3 , table 1 ) .",
    "this is best explained if the atmosphere was derived in part from mantle degassing or if atmospheric volatiles were recycled in the mantle .",
    "the view that part of the atmosphere was degassed from the mantle is supported by the presence in the atmosphere of radiogenic nuclides that are produced in the silicate earth , @xmath107he , @xmath108ne , @xmath109ar , @xmath49xe , and @xmath50xe .",
    "conversely , there is growing evidence that heavy noble gases are efficiently recycled in the mantle .",
    "( 1999 ) observed a correlation between the argon and lead isotopic compositions in mid - atlantic ridge basalts .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation is that ar is recycled at subduction zones ( see burnard 1999 for a different explanation ) .",
    "an additional piece of evidence is given by matsumoto _",
    "( 2001 ) who observed a correlation in xenoliths between the abundances of mantle derived @xmath37he and atmospheric @xmath110ar .",
    "if argon is indeed recycled , then this must be true for heavier noble gases , krypton and xenon .",
    "although very similar , the composition of the shallow mantle is not identical to the composition of the atmosphere .",
    "the most striking difference is the neon isotopic composition of the mantle ( honda _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , trieloff _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , which is very close to solar composition .",
    "this observation , together with the fact that the ne / he ratio of the shallow mantle is close to that of the sun ( honda _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 , moreira _",
    "_ 1998 , moreira and allgre 1998 ) , requires the presence of an unfractionated solar component in the earth .",
    "the second important difference is the xenon stable isotopic composition , which is apparently less fractionated in the mantle than it is in the atmosphere ( caffee _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "the model advocated for the formation of the terrestrial atmosphere postulates that it is derived from solar composition .",
    "if atmospheric volatiles were recycled in the mantle and mixed with solar gases trapped in the silicate earth , this would naturally explain the fact that light noble gases share affinities with the sun while heavy noble gases share affinities with the atmosphere ( fig .",
    "4 ) . a complication arises with xenon , which appears to have distinct isotopic compositions in the mantle and in the atmosphere .",
    "if confirmed , this observation would require the presence of a meteoritic component in the mantle .",
    "note that fractionation of noble gases during recycling can not explain the xenon isotopic composition of the mantle because recycled xe is expected to be enriched in the heavy isotopes , not depleted .",
    "if atmospheric noble gases were recycled in the mantle , the fractionation episode introduced in section 2 could have occurred on a fully accreted planet and cometary material could have been delivered as a late veneer .",
    "it is assumed here that recycled atmospheric volatiles were mixed with solar and possibly meteoritic gases trapped in the mantle , @xmath111 where @xmath112 represents the atmospheric composition fractionated in subduction zones ( for simplicity , it is assumed here that there is no fractionation ) , @xmath113 represents the meteoritic component ( required for explaining the xenon isotopic composition of the mantle ) , and @xmath15 , @xmath23 , and @xmath114 are scaling factors .",
    "the set of parameters that minimizes the @xmath28 merit function is @xmath115 ( table 6 ) . as illustrated in fig . 5",
    ", a good agreement is obtained between the observed and the modeled mantle composition",
    ". a better fit would be obtained if noble gases were fractionated during recycling , the heavy ones being preferentially recycled relative to the light ones ( fig .",
    "4 and 5 ) .",
    "such a fractionation is very likely to occur .",
    "as far as radiogenic isotopes are concerned , a formalism similar to that developed by porcelli and wasserburg ( 1995a , b ) would probably apply .",
    "note that if recycling of noble gases does not occur , then the atmosphere could have been derived from degassing of the upper part of a stratified mantle , and the distinct solar signature of the present silicate earth could have been acquired by subsequent homogenization of the initial layered mantle .",
    "if so , then eq .",
    "15 would still apply .",
    "the origin of the terrestrial atmosphere is one of the most puzzling enigmas of the planetary sciences .",
    "one of the most difficult features to understand is the `` missing xenon '' paradox .",
    "being heavier , xenon should be less depleted and less fractionated than krypton . actually , the opposite is observed .",
    "any fractionation event on the early earth would have resulted in high xe / kr and highly fractionated isotopic ratios .",
    "interestingly , noble gases trapped in cometary ice around 50 k exhibit a clear depletion in xe relative to kr ( owen _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , bar - nun and owen 1998 ) .",
    "an appealing possibilty is that the terrestrial atmosphere has a dual origin , being a mixture between a fractionated atmosphere and cometary material .",
    "the resulting atmosphere would have near solar xe / kr , almost unfractionated krypton delivered by comets , and fractionated xenon inherited from the fractionation episode .",
    "it is demonstrated that such a model ( fig .",
    "6 ) can account for the observed elemental and isotopic compositions of all noble gases in the terrestrial atmosphere .",
    "the appropriate concave downward curvature of the fractionation law can be obtained under realistic blowoff conditions for the early earth ( hunten _ et al .",
    "the trapping temperature of noble gases is estimated to be lower than @xmath116 k , which is consistent with simulation indicating that the comets accreted by the earth formed beyond the orbit of uranus ( morbidelli _ et al .",
    "the mass of comets accreted by the earth ( @xmath117 kg ) represents a tiny fraction ( @xmath118 ) of the late veneer accreted after differentiation of the core ( dauphas and marty 2002 ) .",
    "the model relies on experiments for deriving the composition of noble gases trapped in cometary ice .",
    "the processes , timescales , and location of cometary formation are still unknown .",
    "measurement of the noble gas composition of real comets will therefore provide key information on the origin of the terrestrial atmosphere .",
