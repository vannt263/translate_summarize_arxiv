    "one of the most intriguing mysteries in the history of modern physics is trying to describe and understand nuclear forces in terms of a basic , elementary theory of strong interactions . despite more than fifty years of intense research in this area only in the last decade",
    "such a connection could be established , between what is believed to be the theory of strong interactions , qcd , and the rich phenomenology of low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "chiral symmetry plays an essencial role in this game .",
    "weinberg @xcite first pointed out that it can be used to obtain not only the same predictions of current algebra @xcite , but also corrections to them .",
    "later these ideas were systematically elaborated by gasser and leutwyler @xcite , evolving to what is known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "it relies on the fact that the qcd lagrangian exhibits chiral @xmath6 symmetry , @xmath7 being the number of light quarks ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and , eventually , @xmath10 quarks ) , in the limit where their masses , @xmath11 , go to zero .",
    "this underlying theory is then described effectively including the relevant degrees of freedom ( pions and nucleons for the case we are interested in , @xmath12 ) in the most generic way constrained only by the allowed symmetries , and caracterized by an expansion parameter @xmath13 representing either the momenta involved or the symmetry breaking terms @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the goldstone boson ( pion ) mass .",
    "the effective theory is then evaluated by means of feynman diagrams , strictly obeying a given power counting scheme .",
    "these ideas were successfuly applied to many processes in the mesonic sector , forming a compelling evidence that chpt indeed represents qcd in the low - energy regime @xcite .",
    "the power counting is an essential ingredient in chpt , allowing us to evaluate corrections in a consistent and controlled way . in the mesonic sector",
    "it follows naturally , once loop contributions are regularized using dimensional regularization . on the other hand , with baryons an additional energy scale ( the baryon mass )",
    "is introduced , which does not vanish in the chiral limit and makes the theory much more complicated , with chiral loops ( using dimensional regularization ) spoiling the power counting @xcite . for many years",
    "it was believed that a relativistic treatment of baryons in chpt was not consistent with power counting .",
    "the first and widely used formalism which restores the latter consists in applying a sort of non - relativistic expansion at the level of the lagrangian , around the limit of infinitely heavy baryon ( hbchpt ) , proposed by jenkins and manohar in the early 90s @xcite .",
    "almost ten years later , becher and leutwyler @xcite showed that it is possible to formulate baryonic chpt preserving explicit lorentz invariance and power counting ( rbchpt ) .",
    "based on previous works of ellis and tang @xcite , the so called infrared regularization allows one to not only remove the power counting violating terms from loop integrals , but also recover the results from hbchpt when subjected to an expansion in powers of the inverse of the baryon mass . from the latter , becher and leutwyler showed that the heavy baryon approach fails to preserve the correct analytic structure of the theory in a specific low energy domain . in @xmath3 scattering",
    ", this region corresponds to the mandelstam variable @xmath16 close to @xmath17 .",
    "this motivated further studies inside the covariant framework @xcite .    in recent works",
    "@xcite we brought the issue of hbchpt and rbchpt to the two - pion exchange nucleon - nucleon potential ( tpep ) , showing that its long distance properties are governed by the same low energy region where the hbchpt has convergence problems .",
    "in @xcite we also performed an expansion of our results in powers of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being the nucleon mass ) and compared with the hb expressions from entem and machleidt @xcite , where we found a small number of differences .",
    "these works triggered the importance to assess quantitatively the differences between the hb- and rb - chpt @xmath1 potentials in asymptotic phase shifts , and if they are comparable to the uncertainties in the parameters of the potential , the so called low energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "the discrepancies found between our _ expanded _ @xcite and",
    "the hb @xcite expressions also needs to be understood as they should , in principle , coincide .",
    "it is the main goal of this work to address both issues .",
    "the determination of the lecs is of much current interest , as they describe the dynamics of qcd at low energies . at the order we are working on",
    ", it requires the knowledge of the dimension two ( @xmath20 ) and three ( @xmath21 ) lecs , present at the order @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and order @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) pion - nucleon chiral lagrangians , respectively .",
    "obviously , it seems more natural trying to obtain their values from @xmath3 processes . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was performed through a fit to threshold and subthreshold parameters , and a physical interpretation for their values was given , similar to what has been done in the pure mesonic sector @xcite .",
    "for instance , assuming that the lec @xmath26 is entirely saturated by a scalar meson exchange , a perfect agreement for their mass and coupling constant with the ones used by the bonn one boson exchange model @xcite emerges .",
    "the other dimension two lecs @xmath27 , @xmath4 , and @xmath28 where also estimated to be dominated by the delta resonance , with relevant contributions from rho ( @xmath28 ) and sigma ( @xmath4 ) mesons , and marginal contributions from the roper resonance @xmath29(1440 ) . however , description of @xmath3 phase shifts , albeit consistent , was not satisfactory , the same happening with the values from moji @xcite .",
    "it was improved in subsequent papers @xcite , but the central values for the lecs still vary considerably @xcite .",
    "moreover , the most reasonable results were obtained using the experimental analyses from the karlsruhe group @xcite , which show disagreements with most recent @xmath3 database . as an alternative to @xmath3 processes , recently the nijmegen group proposed the extraction of the dimension two lecs @xmath26 , @xmath4 , and @xmath28 using @xmath1 partial wave analyses @xcite , where they obtained values with ( statistical ) uncertainties much smaller than obtained from @xmath3 processes .",
    "their values were disputed by entem and machleidt @xcite , and in this work we also try to investigate this question .",
    "an important point here is that we do not try to address details of the non - perturbative aspect of the @xmath1 interaction ; instead , we deal only with the two - nucleon irreducible diagrams up to order @xmath5 , which should be identified with the irreducible kernel in a bethe - salpeter equation , or the potential in a lippmann - schwinger equation . as suggested by weinberg @xcite , the usual power counting of chpt should be applied to it .",
    "the reducible diagrams are afflicted with infrared divergences ( or , in the language of old - fashioned time - ordered perturbation theory , small energy denominators ) and , depending on the power counting adopted , a resumation of certain classes of diagrams have to be performed to all orders .",
    "the non - perturbative problem is dealt in the more generic framework of effective field theory ( eft , for reviews see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and , despite of the progress it has achieved in the last years @xcite there are still controversies about power counting schemes @xcite .",
    "this work follows the same spirit as the ones from kaiser _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , entem and machleidt @xcite , and ballot , rocha , and robilotta @xcite , in the sense that we look only at peripheral waves ( @xmath30 ) where the born approximation is expected to be valid @xcite . with this procedure",
    "we try to investigate how far we are from the dream of establish , as in the case of the one - pion exchange ( ope ) in the mid-60s , a mathematical structure for the two - pion exchange ( tpe ) which can be called ",
    "unique \" , dictaded by chiral symmetry ( by unique here we do not consider ambiguities arising from off - shell effects @xcite or choices of field variables @xcite , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we present the motivation of our previous works with some detail , showing the contrast between rb and hb calculations for the tpep . there",
    "we also address the differences we found when comparing our _ expanding _ results with the hb expressions , and their origin are better ( but still not completely ) understood .",
    "an interesting outcome of this work is a quantitative measure of how different ranges of the potential contributes to the phase shifts , and this was made possible by the use of the phase function ( or variable phase ) method , described in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] .",
    "this study , as well as the dependence of the phase shifts with some of the existing values for the lecs , is shown in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] , where we found some restrictions in order to achieve consistency with the experimental data .",
    "we close this work with our conclusions and remarks in sec .",
    "in our recent works @xcite we argued that the problem of convergence that appears in the hb formulation manifests itself in the tpep at large distances .",
    "this was ilustrated by comparing our basic loop functions with their @xmath18 expansion , the latter not being able to reproduce the correct asymptotic behavior . in the end of this section",
    "we show that the same occurs to the tpep decomposed in peripheral partial waves ( @xmath31 ) . before that",
    ", we present a discussion about the differences we found between our _ expanded _ results and the ones obtained in the hb framework @xcite .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that they must in principle coincide , therefore , such discrepancies should not exist . to investigate them we revised some of our calculations , and",
    "updated results are presented in secs .",
    "[ secii2l ] and [ seciihbexp ] . in order to fix the notation and",
    "help understanding the origin of these discrepancies we outline the main steps on the derivation of our tpep . for further details , we direct the reader to our previous works @xcite . for numerical evaluations , in this section",
    "we use the same values for the lecs used by entem and machleidt @xcite ( last column of table [ tab3 ] ) .      the tpe contribution to the @xmath1 interaction",
    "can be parametrized in terms of @xmath3 scattering sub - amplitudes , as ilustrated by the first graph on the right hand side of fig .",

    "the reason is that they are channels with total isospin @xmath114 , leading to cancelations between isoscalar and isovector components . as an example , for total spin @xmath115 states the tensor and spin - orbit components do nt contribute and the potential is given by    @xmath116= v_c^++(4t-3)\\,v_c^--3\\big[v_{ss}^++(4t-3)\\,v_{ss}^-\\big]= v_c^+-3\\,v_c^--3\\,\\big[v_{ss}^+-3\\,v_{ss}^-\\big]\\,.\\ ] ]    at @xmath117fm one has , for the rb and hb cases ,    @xmath118_{rb}= \\big[-150.0 - 3(-78.7)\\big]-3\\big[30.1 - 3(4.28)\\big ] \\approx86.1 - 51.8\\approx34.3 \\label{eq : singrb } \\\\[1 mm ] v\\left[{}^1l_j\\right]_{hb}= \\big[-150.7 - 3(-88.8)\\big]-3\\big[30.4 - 3(3.78)\\big ] \\approx115.7 - 57.2\\approx58.5 \\label{eq : singhb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( in units of @xmath119mev ) . from eqs.([eq : singrb ] ) and ( [ eq : singhb ] ) one can understand the mechanism that leads to a deviation of roughly 70% in the final result : it comes first from the structure [ ( isoscalar)-3(isovector ) ] ( which generates more than 30% of deviation from the central component ) , and is further increased by the sum of central and spin - spin contributions .

    "as mentioned in sec .  [ seciicomp ] , the calculation of phase shifts requires the regularization of the potential near the origin and , as a consequence , makes our calculation dependent on the value of the regulator .",
    "this procedure is analogous to , in momentum space , introduce a cutoff in the dynamical equation , and seems to be unavoidable when dealing with two or more nucleon systems .",
    "there are , though , attempts to reformulate the problem using dimensional regularization @xcite or variants @xcite in the literature .",
    "one should emphasize that even if the chiral potential is finite in momentum space , its representation in configuration space shows a divergence at the origin of the type @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is some integer .",
    "it simply maps the fact that a chiral potential has a limited region of applicability , increasing as a polinomial in @xmath13 ( in contrast , for instance , with phenomenological one - boson exchange potentials ) .",
    "the advantage to work in configuration space is that statements about ranges and nucleon sizes can be made more transparently , and also it is more suitable to be extended to few body calculations for nuclei up to @xmath122 , _",
    "e.g. _ , by means of the variational or green function monte carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "we introduced a regulator given by eq.([eq : regul ] ) , with @xmath105@xmath106 , in our calculations . in principle",
    "there is not a real compelling justification to use such a value . with higher values",
    ", however , the phase shifts using the lecs from fettes _ et.al._ , or from moji , become even more unrealistic . for lower values the situation interchanges , as ilustrated in fig .",
    "[ figreg3f4 ] , but at the expense of large modifications in the strength of the potential .",
    "for example , using @xmath123 one has a reduction of almost half of the  bare \" value of the potential at @xmath124fm . with @xmath125 at the same point , it reduces roughly 8% . from the same figure",
    "we see that , even with this regulator , the sets with larger absolute values of @xmath4 are still far from pwa results ( figs .",
    "[ prepsf][prepsh ] ) .",
    "there might be two explanations for this to happen .",
    "one , that @xmath94 waves are not peripheric enough to avoid the dependence on short distances of the potential , but we check that similar behavior holds for @xmath126 wave as well . also , one can rule out this option by calculating the phase shifts in born approximation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figborn ] , where there is no need to regulate the potential near the origin .",
    "the other possible explanation rely on eft ideas to deal with divergences in the dynamical equation , implemented by the introduction of a cutoff . to be consistent ,",
    "the same cutoff should also regularize loop integrals for the irreducible two - nucleon diagrams that constitute the kernel ( or the potential ) of the dynamical equation .",
    "this procedure can weaken the contribution of pion loops at short and intermediate distances , enough to allow larger absolute values for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we do not address this alternative in the present work , as we keep the possibility of renormalize the dynamical equation by other means , as the ones mentioned before .",
    "a further remark on the regulator is that our calculations , using the same lecs from entem and machleidt , are not very sensitive to its variations in the range @xmath127 , except for @xmath128 and @xmath129 waves . using @xmath130 , we have all of our results very close to theirs  @xcite .",
    "one comment on figs .",
    "[ prepsf][prepsh ] is in order .",
    "we can see that using the lecs from the nijmegen group on the expressions of the @xmath0 tpep does not give a good description of results from pwa , but this procedure does not make sense , as these lecs were determined using a potential to @xmath131 @xcite . it is well known that the lecs pinned down by any particular process depend on",
    "the order one is working on .",
    "formally the difference between using an @xmath131 and @xmath0 tpep should be of higher order , but in practice it is sizeable ( see , for instance , the @xmath3 scattering analysis from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we can check that the too strong attraction , which arises if one uses the lecs from the nijmegen group in the @xmath0 potential ( nij@xmath132 ) , is actually not that attractive if one considers it up to @xmath131 ( nij@xmath133 ) , bringing their phase shifts closer to the ones from pwa .",
    "[ compotf3 ] ilustrates this point for @xmath107 wave .",
    "the thick - solid curve is the potential using the lecs from entem and machleidt , while the dashed and solid curves are the nij@xmath133 and nij@xmath132 potentials , respectively . for comparison purposes",
    ", we also include the opep ( light , dotted curve ) and the phenomenological reid 93 potential @xcite ( dot - dashed curve ) .    from this figure and",
    "what we discussed above one can say that the argument given by entem and machleidt @xcite , that the lec @xmath4 from the nijmegen group leads to a much stronger potential as a result of a cutoff in the potential at 1.4fm or 1.6fm ( and set to zero until the origin ) could have some meaning _ only if _",
    "such a value were extracted from an @xmath0 tpep .",
    "evidently this is not the case , primarily because the energy - dependent boundary conditions of nijmegen pwa at @xmath134fm does not mean that the potential is zero inside this range . besides that",
    ", the nij@xmath133 potential shows a repulsion beyond @xmath135fm , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ compotf3 ] .",
    "the ( now , not too large ) disagreement of nij@xmath133 must have other explanations . from our point of view , the reason is that the lecs are parameters in the tpep beyond 1.6fm which are determined when the fit to scattering data gives the best @xmath136 with a minimum number of boundary conditions .",
    "this involves sums also over lower partial waves , where the nonperturbative aspect of the nucleon - nucleon interaction is more pronounced .",
    "therefore , the way short distances are parametrized can contaminate the actual value of these lecs , contributing as a systematic error .",
    "moreover , contact terms can start contributing at @xmath137 or @xmath138 to @xmath94 waves , which can change the the behavior of phase shifts even at not so large energies @xcite .",
    "when fitting to data , these terms are inherently taken into account .",
    "to summarize , in this work we address the discrepancies we found when comparing our @xmath18 _ expanded _ results with the expressions from the hb formalism .",
    "it forced us to revise not only our @xmath18 expansions , but also our two loop diagrams , and now we have a better understanding about the origin of the remaining discrepant terms .",
    "there are , however , two terms in the central isovector component , originated from two loop calculations , which could not be understood",
    ". it will be necessary to solve them if claims for higher order calculations of the chiral @xmath1 potential becomes imminent . in a second stage",
    "we calculate the phase shifts for peripheral waves ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ) , where short distances are supposed to play a minor role .",
    "this was shown in figs .",
    "[ figpf - f][figpf - h ] , where the ranges relevant to phase shifts where determined using the method of the phase function .",
    "our results for phase shifts reveals that , due to the overwhelming contribution of the opep , any difference between the rb- and hb- tpep is barely noticed .",
    "it is possible that these differences might be relevant in processes where the opep is cancelled , and the dominant tail of the interaction , given by the tpep , for instance , in low - energy peripheral scattering of nucleons off isoscalar targets @xcite",
    ". a more relevant question , there are large variations of the phase shifts with the existing values of lecs , predominantly due to @xmath4 , which dictates the strength of the attraction of the potential . consistency with pwa favors smaller values , in magnitude , than the existent ones in the literature .",
    "there are , however , conceptual details mentioned before which prevent , at the moment , to constrain these lecs with a satisfactory precision .",
    "they should be well understood and quantified if one aims to extract values with good precision from @xmath1 scattering .",
