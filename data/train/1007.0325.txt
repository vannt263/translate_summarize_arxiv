    "in geometric accounts to routh reduction  @xcite it is custom to first consider the restriction of the dynamics associated to a lagrangian system with symmetry to the level set of the momentum map @xmath2 and then reduce to the quotient manifold under the action of the isotropy group @xmath3 . because this procedure is very similar to symplectic or marsden - weinstein reduction ,",
    "one often states that _ routh reduction is the lagrangian analogue of cotangent bundle reduction _ ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another essential ingredient in the work on routh reduction is the existence of a regularity condition on the momentum map",
    "@xmath1 : it guarantees that the manifold @xmath4 is diffeomorphic to @xmath5 .",
    "roughly said , this condition provides the manifold @xmath4 with a tangent bundle structure , an essential feature to reinterpret the reduced dynamics as being euler - lagrange equations .",
    "we say that lagrangians satisfying this regularity condition are @xmath6-regular .",
    "for example , the classical @xmath7 lagrangians fit in this context .",
    "unfortunately , there are many lagrangians where this procedure can not be carried out .",
    "this is the case for singular lagrangians , though there are also instances of regular lagrangians where it is impossible to perform routhian reduction in this sense .",
    "a simple one is the lagrangian @xmath8 defined in @xmath9 and symmetric with respect to the action of the group @xmath10 of translations along the @xmath11 coordinate ( using the old language in mechanics , @xmath11 is a cyclic coordinate ) .",
    "the momentum map is @xmath12 . for a frozen value @xmath13 of @xmath1 ,",
    "the quotient @xmath4 can not be identified with @xmath14 as the coordinates of the quotient space @xmath4 are precisely @xmath15 whereas the coordinates of @xmath16 are @xmath17 .",
    "see  [ suy ] below .",
    "the main result of this paper is the generalization of routh reduction to a reduction technique that holds for arbitrary lagrangians with the only requirement of @xmath18 being a regular value of @xmath1 .",
    "the price paid for that is that the reduction process will be carried out in the entire space @xmath19 and not only on @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that the reduction takes place in the whole space does not mean that we loose control of the momentum , at the contrary , the reduction process will keep track of the value of @xmath1 in the same spirit of the classical routh reduction .    in order to relate the presented reduction technique to existing results on geometric routh reduction , we first mention that the correspondence between routh reduction and marsden - weinstein reduction holds at a much more fundamental level : routh - reduction is marsden - weinstein reduction applied to the poincar - cartan symplectic structure on the tangent bundle ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this correspondence was then used to generalize routh reduction to lagrangians that are quasi - invariant ( up to a total time derivative ) .    here",
    "we wish to generalize routh reduction from a different point of view . in classical treatments on routh reduction of a lagrangian system with cyclic coordinates ,",
    "the reduced system is again a lagrangian system with a new lagrangian which is called the routhian .",
    "it is this observation what we take as a starting point in this paper : routh reduction is a reduction technique that preserves the euler - lagrange nature of the original system .",
    "the different steps in the proposed reduction are best illustrated by means of the schematic diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] . for that purpose",
    ", we shall denote for now a lagrangian system as a couple @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the configuration manifold and @xmath0 a function on @xmath19 called the lagrangian .",
    "the first step is to consider an _",
    "equivalent _ lagrangian system on @xmath22 , with lagrangian @xmath23 .",
    "this new lagrangian has the property that solutions of the euler - lagrange equations of @xmath21 with momentum @xmath18 are solutions to @xmath24 with _ momentum _ 0 .",
    "for the sake of completeness we mention here that @xmath24 is _ not conservative _ and additional force terms should be taken into account ; and that the function @xmath23 is only @xmath3 invariant but , as will become clear , we can make sense to a momentum map of @xmath23 taking values in @xmath25 , the dual of the lie - algebra of @xmath6 .",
    "this step is not new and was carried out , for instance , in  @xcite .",
    "the routh reduction technique described in  @xcite is schematically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] by the arrows @xmath26 and @xmath27 , followed in this order .",
    "we shall follow a different path : in our approach the second step is to perform a reduction on the system @xmath24 that is similar to lagrange - poincar reduction , i.e. we reduce the system to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the quotient of @xmath23 ( represented by arrow @xmath30 in the above diagram ) .",
    "we show that this step , in contrast to general lagrange - poincar reduction , preserves the euler - lagrange nature of the original system .",
    "to explain this statement in more detail , we mention here that @xmath31 can be identified with the fibred product of three bundles over @xmath32 : @xmath16 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( the latter being the bundle associated to @xmath35 ) .",
    "roughly said , the routhian @xmath29 depends on velocities @xmath36 in @xmath16 and on points @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the fibres of @xmath33 and @xmath34 above @xmath39 respectively . when we say that @xmath40 is a lagrangian , we understand that the variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 are to be interpreted as _ configuration _ coordinates .",
    "this might be surprising , since @xmath38 is the projection of the vertical part of a velocity upstairs , i.e. a tangent vector in @xmath19 .",
    "it is immediately clear now that the lagrangian @xmath29 is _ singular _ ,",
    "i.e. it does not depend on the velocities of the variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this is another price we pay for keeping the euler - lagrange nature of the system : we have to work with singular lagrangians .",
    "but the _ singularity _ of these systems is of a specific type , which we call throughout this paper _ intrinsically constrained lagrangian systems_. they are studied in detail in section  [ sec : lagsyst ] .",
    "it is well known that singular lagrangians contain _ constraints _ on the solutions to the associated euler - lagrange equations .",
    "it is shown that one of these intrinsic constraints embedded in the system @xmath41 is a reduced version of the _ fixed momentum condition _ @xmath42 . as a result of this lagrangian interpretation of the reduced system @xmath41",
    ", we shall define a presymplectic formulation and , in the most general case , one can apply the presymplectic constraint algorithm  @xcite to find solutions to the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "depending on the nature of these constraints we describe in more detail two distinct cases where this reduced singular lagrangian system is equivalent to a variational problem on the space @xmath43 ; the first case leads to standard routh reduction and the second case is new and , for instance , is applicable to geodesics in general relativity where the metric is invariant under a lightlike vector field .    finally , we wish to mention that besides the importance of routh reduction for mechanical systems by itself , the special features of this process may shed light to other situations .",
    "in particular , this might be the case for field theories .",
    "the covariant reduction of these lagrangian systems under the action of a group of symmetries has been developed in recent years ( see for example @xcite ) , though the hamiltonian counterpart is much less explored .",
    "a generalization of routh techniques to this setting could be of much interest to tackle some of the difficulties encountered in this context ( for instance , the lack of meaning of the notion of fixing the value of the momentum map ) .    throughout this paper manifolds",
    "are always assumed to be smooth finite dimensional ( hausdorff , second countable , @xmath44 ) and smooth always means of class @xmath44 .",
    "we will often consider the pull - back of a bundle , a function , a one- or two - form along a map @xmath45 between two manifolds . to reduce the notational complexity in this paper",
    ", we sometimes denote the pull - backed object with the same symbol as the object itself",
    ". it should be clear from the context what is meant .",
    "given two bundles @xmath46 and @xmath47 over a manifold @xmath48 , then we often consider the fibred product bundle @xmath49 , or simply @xmath50 when no confusion is possible .",
    "elements in such a fibred product are denoted as a couple @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that @xmath54 .",
    "finally , velocities at a point @xmath55 are typically denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "when we consider the tangent vector to a curve @xmath57 at a time @xmath58 , we shall write @xmath59 for the corresponding curve in @xmath60 .",
    "we start with recalling some standard concepts in lagrangian mechanics .",

    "a lagrangian system is a triple @xmath62 with @xmath0 a function on @xmath60 and @xmath63 a co - vector valued function @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath64 , fibred over the identity .",
    "the map @xmath63 is called the force term of the lagrangian system . a lagrangian system @xmath62 is said to be conservative if @xmath65 .",
    "in the above notion of conservative systems we assume that conservative forces are always taken into account by means of their potential energy in the lagrangian function @xmath0 .",

    "we now focus on the euler - lagrange equations for the lagrangian system @xmath91 associated to the intrinsically constrained system @xmath89 ( from now on , we denote @xmath0 and @xmath93 by the same symbol ) . for that purpose ,",

    "becomes : @xmath108 and if @xmath103 is regular , it should be clear that this constraint can be brought into the form @xmath109    an interesting property of intrinsically constrained lagrangian systems with a gyroscopic force term is that they admit a presymplectic formulation on the manifold @xmath110 . to show this , we introduce the following maps :    1 .

    "the routhian on @xmath33 assumes the form @xmath757      we consider a constant magnetic field along the @xmath703-axis in the inertia frame .",
    "the lagrangian of a charged rigid body with a fixed point is invariant under the left action of rotations about the @xmath703-axis ( i.e. when @xmath758 is a coordinate chart determined by the euler - angles , then @xmath759 is ( locally ) cyclic ) .",
