    "to model hard interactions of particles with matter constituents by means of an appropriate binary theory are well established : in this approach collisions are treated as binary processes , that is , either the target electrons are treated as free and at rest , or the influence of binding is accounted for only in an approximated way .",
    "general - purpose monte carlo codes , like egs @xcite , fluka @xcite , geant4 and mcnp @xcite , operate in this context .",
    "their calculations of energy deposit distributions are based on condensed - random - walk schemes of particle transport ; this approach is adequate as long as the discrete energy loss events treated are of magnitudes larger than electronic binding energies .",
    "various specialized monte carlo codes , usually known as `` track structure codes '' , have been developed for microdosimetry and nanodosimetry calculations .",
    "they handle particle interactions with matter as discrete processes : all collisions are explicitly simulated as single - scattering interactions .",
    "this approach is suitable to studies where the precise structure of the energy deposit and of the secondary particle production associated with a track is essential ; nevertheless , the detailed treatment of collisions down to very low energy results in a high computational demand .    there is increasing evidence that the pattern of radiation interaction on the nanometer level is critical for the biological effects of ionizing radiation ; in addition , radiation effects at the nano - scale are important for the protection of electronic devices operating in various radiation environments .    in realistic use cases such small - scale systems",
    "are often embedded in larger scale ones : for instance , a component may operate within a hep experiment or on a satellite in space , cellular and sub - cellular aggregates in real biological systems exist in complex body structures etc .",
    "so far , simulation based on condensed - random - walk schemes and track structure generation have been treated as distinct computational domains .",
    "the separation of the two simulation domains is due to the conceptual and technical difficulty of handling the two schemes in the same simulation environment .",
    "achieving a conceptual approach and an architectural design where the two schemes can co - work would represent a significant progress in monte carlo simulation .",
    "recently , a set of specialized processes for track structure simulation in liquid water has been designed and implemented in geant4 @xcite ; like their equivalent in dedicated monte carlo codes , they operate in the rgime of discrete interactions only . as a further step to provide the experimental community with tools for geant4-based simulations at the nano - scale ,",
    "the physics capabilities of a monte carlo code for nanodosimetry simulation @xcite are being re - engineered for use with geant4 kernel .",
    "this extension of geant4 capabilities is part of a larger scale r&d project for multi - scale simulation , which investigates the concept of adaptable , co - working condensed and discrete transport schemes @xcite .",
    "nanodosimetric quantities , like size distributions of clustered ionization , are important in understanding the radiation - induced damage in biological targets of nanometric size ( such as dna segments ) @xcite .",
    "these quantities , however , are not directly measurable in biological targets and their actual knowledge is mostly based on theoretical models . a practice to overcome",
    "this problem is to measure cluster - size distributions using a nanodosimeter , which consists basically of a gas - filled counter operating at low pressure .    a typical nanodosimeter , as developed in several institutions in the past few years @xcite , consists of a low - pressure interaction chamber , an electrode system to extract ions or low - energy electrons from the interaction chamber , an evacuated drift column which includes at its end a single - particle counter , and a primary - particle detector .",
    "when charged particles enter the interaction chamber , they penetrate through or pass aside a wall - less target volume of definite shape and size , and finally reach a trigger detector at the opposite end of the chamber .",
    "ions or low energy electrons produced within the target volume are extracted from the interaction chamber and guided into an evacuated drift chamber where they are detected by a single - particle counter .",
    "if such measurements are performed for a large number of primary particles of radiation quality q , the final result is the probability distribution @xmath0 of ionization cluster size _",
    "n_.    these nanodosimeters were developed aided by the important contribution of particle - track monte carlo simulations .",
    "these simulations require an accurate , complete and consistent set of scattering cross sections in the gas of interest .    in order to take advantage of the geometrical modeling capabilities and the features for the description of larger scale environments available in multi - purpose monte carlo codes ,",
    "it is desirable to integrate their capabilities with an appropriate particle - track code , capable of accurate transport of electrons with kinetic energies below 1 kev , down to the ionization threshold .",
    "the project in progress aims at reengineering the physics modeling capabilities of a track - structure code developed in the past years for nanodosimetry applications @xcite into a set of simulation tools compatible with geant4 kernel .",
    "the corresponding software process is based on the unified process @xcite : it adopts an iterative and incremental life - cycle , providing concrete deliverables at each iteration .",
    "the original `` track structure '' code was developed according to a procedural programming paradigm and is written in fortran .",
    "the availability of its functionality for operation in an open source , general purpose simulation environment would provide experimentalists more powerful modeling capabilities for nanodosimetric studies than the original code : researchers would be able to exploit the rich functionality of other geant4 domains , like geometry , navigation , visualization and other features , along with the specialized physics available in the original standalone fortran code .",
    "once reengineered for use compatible with geant4 kernel , the functionality corresponding to `` track structure '' simulation , i.e. pertinent to a discrete transport scheme , would provide a valuable playground for the ongoing research on co - working condensed and discrete schemes , which is the object of the nano5 @xcite r&d process .",
    "the introduction of equivalent physics capabilities in an object oriented simulation environment is directly based on the literature documenting the physics models implemented in the original track structure system , rather than on the fortran code itself .",
    "the largely different software technology adopted by the two systems prevents the reuse of the existing procedural code : a sound solution requires rethinking the software design supporting the physics capabilities in terms of an object oriented paradigm .",
    "therefore the whole reengineering process is performed on the ground of the pertinent physics literature : the problem domain analysis , the software design and the implementation .",
    "this process ensures the optimization of the software quality through the adoption of established best practices , and the effective investment of the limited available resources .",
    "the reengineering process is currently going through the inception phase .",
    "requirements are captured from the pertinent literature and analyzed ; their impact on geant4 simulation kernel is evaluated in depth . at this stage the analysis and design process explores the capability of policy - based design @xcite of supporting the physics functionality of a large scale track structure code in an object oriented environment .",
    "the agility of the design , discussed in @xcite , facilitates testing physics functionality thoroughly along with the implementation process : the test process can easily encompass both the verification of the correctness of the implementation and the validation against experimental data ( if available ) at the level of unit testing .",
    "ionization produced by slow ( kinetic energy smaller than few kev ) electrons is one of the main processes which should be simulated in nanodosimetry .",
    "the mean free path of electrons due to the ionization process is defined by the total ionization cross section . here",
    "we show some preliminary results concerning the implementation of the binary encounter bethe ( beb ) model for the total ionization cross section of slow electrons with atoms and molecules .",
    "the model has been implemented in a policy - based class design similar to the approach adopted in @xcite to model photon interactions .      according to the binary encounter bethe model @xcite ,",

    "the @xmath13 value relates to the atomic oscillator strength distribution , @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the kinetic energy of the ejected ( ionization ) electron .    in the cases ,",
    "when the distribution @xmath14 is unknown , one can set @xmath17  @xcite",
    ". then equation ( [ beb ] ) can be simplified : @xmath18 the total ionization cross section is defined by the summation of equation ( [ sbeb ] ) over all involved atomic shells .",
