    "the advent of high  resolution x - ray spectroscopy with the  x - ray observatory and xmm  newton , as well as far  ultraviolet spectroscopy with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph on hst , has shed a great deal of light on the local warm  hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations predict that this tenuous web of @xmath4k gas should contain about half of the baryons in the nearby universe @xcite , appearing as a forest of highly ionized metal absorption lines in high signal  to  noise x - ray spectra of background sources @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent  grating observations of this `` x - ray forest '' toward bright blazars have confirmed these predictions ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * nicastro et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition to the intervening absorption systems , similar metal absorption lines ( primarily ) are observed at redshifts consistent with zero toward several background quasars , such as mrk  421 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter w05 ) , pks  2155 - 304 ( * ? ? ?",

    "this nearby absorption presents a unique puzzle : since no morphological or distance information is known about the x - ray absorption ( other than limited spatial data along the very few quasar pencil beams where it has been detected ) , it is still unknown whether this warm  hot gas originates within the galactic halo or rather is part of the local group whim , or a combination of the two .",
    "while some  absorption has been detected within 50kpc of the galaxy @xcite , this is unlikely to be uniformly distributed .",
    "additionally , constrained simulations of the local supercluster predict high column densities of  and  in some directions @xcite .",
    "it is thus likely that galactic and extragalactic phenomena both contribute to the local x - ray absorption , but the question of which sightlines are dominated by which phenomena is , by and large , unanswered .    further complicating the issue is the presence of other gaseous components of unknown origin . high ",
    "velocity clouds ( hvcs ) have a velocity distribution inconsistent with the galactic rotation and therefore are thought to be either neutral gas high in the galactic halo ( perhaps from tidally stripped dwarf galaxies ) or cooling , infalling gas from the surrounding igm . along many lines of sight studied with fuse ,",
    "velocity  absorption lines ( ) at velocities coincident with the hvcs are seen , while in some other directions  is present even in the absence of any significant 21-cm emission at the same velocity @xcite .",
    "the question of whether these isolated  hvcs arise in an extended , hot galactic corona or at local group scales  and their relation to the @xmath1 x - ray absorption lines  is a subject of continuing debate .",
    "there is some evidence for such a galactic corona ( discussed in detail by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; indeed , a significant fraction of hvcs appear to exhibit low  ionization absorption lines ( such as cii  iv and siii  iv ) , unlikely to arise in a low  density , warm  hot photoionized medium @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the velocity distribution of these unassociated  clouds is minimized in the local group rest frame , indicating that their origin is extragalactic .",
    "additionally , w05 found that the  toward mrk 421 can not be associated with the  along that sightline ( assuming a single temperature / density phase ) .",
    "however , the links between the , hvcs , and local /  absorption in the context of the galactic corona and local whim are to a large degree unknown . determining the origin of these components , and the relations between them , is a crucial step in our understanding of the ongoing process of galaxy formation    the nearby ( @xmath2 ) , x - ray bright seyfert galaxy mrk  279 lies in the direction of the hvc complex c , thus providing a particularly valuable background source that can be used to study these gaseous components . here",
    "we report on our analysis of deep  and fuse spectra of this object , the detected uv and x - ray absorption , and the implications for gas in the galaxy and local group .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    seven observations of mrk 279 taken with the  high resolution camera spectroscopic array ( hrc - s ) and low energy transmission grating ( letg ) , all taken in may 2003 and totaling 340 ks of exposure time , were available in the  archive .",
    "each of these data sets was processed , and instrument response files built , using the standard data reduction threads for hrc - s / letg with version 3.3 of the  _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) _ software and  calibration database version 3.2.0 .",
    "since the hrc - s does not have sufficient energy resolution to distinguish letg spectral orders , higher orders can increase the apparent flux at long wavelengths .",
    "this effect was mitigated by including response files for orders @xmath5 through @xmath6 in our analysis ; the inclusion of orders beyond these had an insignificant effect on the computed instrumental response .",
    "the seven observations were coadded for a final ( unbinned , with @xmath7 ) signal  to  noise ratio of @xmath8 near 22 .",
    "we used the spectral fitting program _",
    "sherpa _ to fit a power law and foreground galactic absorption to the spectrum over @xmath9    band ( excluding the @xmath10    and @xmath11    chip gap regions ) .",
    "the relative galactic abundances of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and neon were left as free parameters in order to produce a better fit around the absorption edges . a power ",
    "law slope of @xmath12 and equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath13  @xmath14 is derived , agreeing reasonably well with the @xcite value of @xmath15  @xmath14 near this sightline .",
    "fit abundances of n and ne were approximately zero , oxygen equal to the solar value , and carbon 0.15 solar , though we re  emphasize that these do not reflect actual galactic abundances but rather provide a better fit near absorption edges where the calibration is uncertain .",
    "a few weak , broad residuals remained afterward , probably due to calibration uncertainties or source variability ; these were corrected by including four broad gaussians in the source model ( analogous to the technique described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    once the continuum was established , we visually searched the spectrum in @xmath16    windows for narrow ( unresolved ) absorption lines , fitting each one with a gaussian .",
    "although several strong lines such as , , and   are apparent at the agn redshift ( @xmath2 ) , at @xmath1 ( @xmath17 ) only  k@xmath0 @xmath18 is unambiguously detected at @xmath19  ( @xmath20 ) with an equivalent width of @xmath21  m .",
    "upper limits were measured for the  k@xmath22 line as well as several other ionic species of interest ; these measurements are listed in table  [ tab_lines ] .",
    "although they are included in the model to improve consistency , the absorption intrinsic to mrk  279 and the galactic interstellar lines are not the focus of this work and will not be discussed further . the resulting fit and residuals",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig_chandraspec ] ; with a reduced @xmath23 value of 0.89 , the model appears to fit the data quite well .",
    "the  hrc - s / letg wavelength scale is uncertain for several reasons , primarily because of non  linearities resulting from bad amplifiers on the hrc - s detector .",
    "while the newly  released ciao 3.3 software includes a routine to correct these non  linearities and has reduced the dispersion in wavelength errors to @xmath24m  at short wavelengths in calibration spectra , this routine is in the early stages of development and wavelengths of individual emission and absorption lines may still be systematically skewed .",
    "however , any systematic wavelength errors should not vary between observations as long as the telescope pointing is nominal .",
    "furthermore , while serious wavelength errors are known to occur around 18 , no bad amplifiers are expected to significantly affect the dispersion relation near 21.6   ( j.  j.  drake and n.  brickhouse , private communication ) .    to check the absolute wavelength scale near the  line",
    ", we retrieved the nearest hrc ",
    "s / letg calibration observation of the x - ray bright star capella ( observation 3675 , taken on 2003 september 28 ) from the  archive and reprocessed the data in exactly the same manner as the mrk 279 data .",
    "the wavelength of the strong  emission line was found to be @xmath25  or @xmath26 , which is consistent with the @xmath27  radial velocity of capella as listed in the simbad database . as a separate check",
    ", we reduced the mrk  279  data both with and without the wavelength correction routine ; the difference in the measured  wavelength between the two was only 4m , much lower than the statistical error on the line position .",
    "thus , although the possibility of systematic wavelength errors must be kept in mind , it appears as though such effects are insignificant compared to the statistical error on the measured  wavelength .",
    "mrk  279 was observed four times with fuse between december 1999 and may 2003 with a total exposure time of 224  ks ; all calibrated data from these observations were obtained through the multimission archive at stsci website . to account for small shifts in the  wavelength scale during the observations , each of the constituent exposures was cross  correlated over the @xmath28  range and the relative positions of strong absorption lines were checked by eye .",
    "the data from 18 may 2002 were not of sufficient quality to reliably perform this wavelength calibration and were thus excluded .",
    "the coadded , wavelength - shifted spectra from each observation were then cross  correlated with each other , scaled so that their continuum intensities matched , combined and rebinned by five pixels ( @xmath29 ) to produce a final spectrum with @xmath30 near 1032  and an effective exposure time of 177  ks .    to account for possible systematic offsets ,",
    "the absolute wavelength scale of the final spectrum was corrected following the method employed by w05 : the galactic @xmath31 and @xmath32 absorption profiles were fit with multiple gaussian components and the column density  weighted average velocities calculated .",
    "these were found to be @xmath33  and @xmath34  respectively , while the average velocity of the @xcite multi  component fit to the galactic toward the mrk  279 sightline is @xmath35 . since these low  ionization lines are expected to co -",
    "exist with the , a @xmath27  shift was applied to the wavelength scale of the fuse spectrum .",
    "the final combined and calibrated fuse spectrum shows strong   absorption from the galactic thick disk at @xmath36 and a weaker  high velocity component ( ) at @xmath37(figure  [ fig_velplot ] ) .",
    "each of these features was initially modeled with a single gaussian ; however , this provided a poor fit for the thick  disk absorption due to an asymmetric blue wing on the line profile ; thus , the galactic  was instead fit with a broad and a narrow gaussian component ( hereafter denoted  and   respectively ) .",
    "measured line parameters are also listed in table  [ tab_lines ] ; note that the velocity of the  is tightly constrained by this fit as @xmath38 , which is inconsistent at the @xmath39 level with the  velocity of @xmath40   ( assuming the hrc - s / letg wavelength scale is correct ) , indicating that these two components almost certainly are not related .",
    "the total equivalent widths of the  galactic and high  velocity components are @xmath41  m  and @xmath42  m   respectively , in agreement within the estimated systematic errors of the @xcite measurements of @xmath43  m  and @xmath44  m  ( where the first and second error values are statistical and systematic , respectively ) . as was the case for the mrk  421 sightline ( w05 ) , our fitted galactic@xmath45hvc  equivalent width agrees quite well with the @xcite direct  integration value but our measurement of the  strength is somewhat lower and galactic absorption higher ; this is most likely because our method better accounts for blending between the galactic and high ",
    "velocity  in cases where distinct absorption components are evident ( as discussed in more detail in w05 ) .",
    "in order to derive physical properties of the observed absorption , it is necessary to first convert the measured equivalent widths into ionic column densities @xmath46 .",
    "this requires knowledge of the doppler parameter @xmath47 , since at a fixed column density @xmath48 decreases for lower values of @xmath47 .",
    "however , the nominal letg resolution of @xmath49  ( @xmath50  at 21 ) precludes direct measurement of the  line width . a method similar to that employed in w05",
    "is thus used to place limits on the  doppler parameter using the measured equivalent width of the  k@xmath0 line and the upper limit on  k@xmath22 .",
    "equivalent widths and fwhm values for each transition were calculated ( assuming a voigt absorption profile ) over a grid of @xmath51 and @xmath47 , and the tracks in the @xmath52 plane consistent with each measured @xmath53 equivalent width limit are plotted in figure  [ fig_nhb_ovii ] .",
    "determining the ranges of @xmath51 and @xmath47 for which the measured column densities are consistent with each other ( i.e. the area over which the k@xmath0 and k@xmath22 tracks `` overlap '' ) is more complicated . in the mrk",
    "421 data the first three lines in the  k  series were individually detected at @xmath54 confidence . in that case , the differences between pairs of predicted @xmath51 values ( and the joint errors on the differences ) were calculable , allowing easy determination of the region over which the three transitions predicted consistent @xmath51 and @xmath47 values . in the case of mrk  279 , however , this same method can not be used because while the  k@xmath0 line has been detected , only an upper limit is available for the k@xmath22 line .    however , since the absorption line properties for various column densities and doppler parameters are known , limits on these quantities can be determined using the  spectrum itself .",
    "for each point in the @xmath52 plane ,  k@xmath0 and k@xmath22 absorption lines with the calculated @xmath48 and fwhm values were added to the best ",
    "fit continuum model , and the @xmath23 statistic calculated using the `` goodness '' command in sherpa . over the calculated parameter ranges , the minimum @xmath23 point was on the @xmath55  boundary . since the k@xmath22 line was completely undetected ( with a best ",
    "fit amplitude near zero ) , the @xmath23 value asymptotically approaches a minimum as @xmath47 increases .",
    "we thus assumed a minimum @xmath23 value from a fit with a fixed unsaturated line ratio ( @xmath56 ) and calculated @xmath57 for every point .",
    "the 95% confidence interval ( @xmath58 ) determined with this method is shown in figure  [ fig_nhb_ovii ] ; at this confidence level all doppler parameters between @xmath59  are ruled out .",
    "although these curve  of  growth diagnostics can in principle also be applied to the uv   @xmath60 absorption doublet , it is typically more difficult because few galactic  sightlines are sufficiently saturated to significantly affect the doublet line ratio ; additionally , the close proximity of the 1037  line to other galactic absorption features makes deblending difficult ( w05 ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , since the  @xmath61 line is fully resolved in the fuse spectrum , the measured line width is highly sensitive to @xmath47 while the equivalent width traces @xmath62 . while @xmath48 decreases for a saturated line of a fixed column density , the observed fwhm increases from the unsaturated value of @xmath63 . to account for these saturation effects",
    ", we computed  @xmath61 equivalent widths and fwhm values over a grid of @xmath62 and @xmath47 .",
    "regions for which the fwhm and @xmath48 measurements are consistent with predicted values are shown for both  and  in figure  [ fig_nhb_ovi ] ; since the fwhm and @xmath48 regions overlap nearly orthogonally , strong constraints are placed on the column density and velocity dispersion of the bearing gas .",
    "none of the  broad , narrow , or high  velocity components are significantly saturated , with derived doppler parameters of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66  ( @xmath67 errors ) respectively .",
    "all  component doppler parameters are inconsistent with the upper allowed range ( @xmath68 ) determined from the  ratios , and only the  is marginally consistent with the lower   range ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this indicates that the majority of the @xmath36  can not originate in the same phase as the observed  absorption .",
    "although at first glance it appears possible for the and  to coexist , the velocity separation of the  and   ( as discussed in  [ sec_meas_fuse ] ) makes this interpretation unlikely ; additionally , the large /  column density ratio ( @xmath70 ; figure  [ fig_nhb_ovii ] ) requires high temperatures which are in turn ruled out by the low @xmath47 value ( discussed further in the following section ) .",
    "it is also possible that the thick  disk  consists of only one component with a non  gaussian shape , in which case the actual velocity dispersion could be larger .",
    "approximating the low  velocity with a single gaussian component yields @xmath71 barely consistent with the 95% lower limit on the  doppler parameter .",
    "we thus conclude that the  most likely does not coexist with any of the measured  components .",
    "the derived ionic column density ratios ( and upper limits thereupon ) can be used to determine the physical state of the absorbing medium .",
    "since the extent , and hence the density , of the absorber is unknown , we can not assume a priori whether or not photoionization from the galactic or extragalactic background plays a significant role in the ionization balance of the medium .",
    "specifically , in a higher  density , hot medium ( such as a galactic corona ) , collisional ionization would be the dominant process by far , while in a low  density whim scenario photoionization is expected to play a significant role . including the effects of photoionization along with collisional ionization is crucial in order to most accurately determine the state of the gas ( cf .",
    "* w05 ) .",
    "we used version 05.07 of the ionization balance code cloudy @xcite to calculate ionic abundances for all measured elements over a grid of @xmath72k and ionization parameters @xmath73  to  @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the ratio of the number densities of ionizing photons and electrons in the plasma ) , with a step size of 0.1 dex in both @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the @xcite fit to the metagalactic radiation field was assumed ; this is based on the observed background from infrared to x - rays ( except for the unobservable radiation near the lyman limit , which is taken from the theoretical model of @xcite ) .",
    "the normalization of this background corresponds to electron densities of @xmath78@xmath79 over the calculated @xmath80 range  i.e. , @xmath81 .    as equivalent widths of different transitions from the same ion",
    "can be used to place limits on the absorber s velocity dispersion and column density (  [ sec_cog ] ) , any measured column density _ ratio _ defines a track in the @xmath82 plane .",
    "the overlap between two or more such tracks ( derived from different ion ratios ) can then be used to place constraints on the gas temperature and density .",
    "although in principle the ratio between any two ionic species can be employed , column density ratios between different ions of the same atomic species are metallicity  independent and hence produce the strongest diagnostics . since only  is strongly detected at @xmath1 in the mrk  279 spectrum and , , and  together provide strong temperature and density constraints @xcite , we focus primarily on these ions .    a limit on @xmath83 can be easily determined from the  equivalent width upper limit and assuming the  doppler parameter ; however , including the  column density is less straightforward due to the presence of multiple components .",
    "since the  doppler parameter is inconsistent with both of the broad @xmath36  components , there are two likely possibilities : ( 1 ) the  doppler parameter is actually in the lower range ( @xmath84 ) and the  is associated with the , or ( 2 ) the  absorption produced by the bearing gas is too weak to be detected in our fuse spectrum , so only an upper limit on @xmath85 can be used in this analysis .",
    "the former case is highly unlikely  not only is the centroid of the  line inconsistent with the velocity of the , but such a low doppler parameter requires extremely high  column densities ( @xmath86@xmath14 ) .",
    "this in turn produces an extremely large @xmath87 ratio which requires high temperatures ( @xmath88k , the upper limit of our calculation ) .",
    "since the  doppler parameter implies a maximum temperature of @xmath89k , such an association appears impossible .",
    "if , instead , the associated  absorption is too weak to be detected , then this absorption most likely takes the form of a broad ( @xmath90 , from the  @xmath47 limit ) absorption line superposed on the @xmath36 .",
    "such a line was included in the fuse spectrum fit and @xmath53 upper limits calculated for a velocity dispersions of 100 and 200 .",
    "the temperatures and densities consistent with the /  and /  upper limits for both values of @xmath47 are shown in figure  [ fig_temp_dens ] .",
    "the /  ratio sets an upper limit of @xmath91 and a minimum density of @xmath92@xmath79 in both cases . for @xmath93  the limits set by @xmath94 are inconsistent with the @xmath95 ratio , but for @xmath55  the contours begin to overlap with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "thus , if the  is associated with a broad undetected  component , a large doppler parameter is required to reconcile the oxygen ion ratios .",
    "this , along with the inferred temperature and density limits , are both consistent with expectations for the local whim , though the large velocity dispersion compared to the upper temperature limit derived from the /  ratio indicates that the line broadening is primarily nonthermal .",
    "although a similar analysis can be performed with the /  and /  ratios , the derived limits are in all cases weaker than those set by the /  upper limit and have been excluded from figure  [ fig_temp_dens ] for the sake of clarity .",
    "the  spectrum of mrk  279 shows strong , , , and  absorption at a redshift consistent with the agn ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is thus possible that the  absorption line at @xmath1 is contaminated , either by  outflowing from mrk  279 or from another absorption line at @xmath2 .",
    "the former scenario is probably not the case since this would require both an unlikely coincidence of the outflow velocity with the agn redshift ( @xmath98 ) . to check the latter case",
    ", we used the phase model ( described by * ? ? ? * ) to fit the intrinsic absorption in a self  consistent manner . with this fit we found that the redshifted k@xmath22 line falls at 21.5 , near the  k@xmath0 rest wavelength",
    "but well outside the line profile , and is weak enough that its effect on the  @xmath99 equivalent width measurement is most likely negligible .",
    "no other warm  absorber lines are expected near 21.6for outflow velocities between zero and 9000 ; thus , the @xmath1  measurement is unlikely to be contaminated by any lines from the warm absorber .",
    "the details of the warm absorber model are the subject of a forthcoming paper ( d.  l.  fields et al . , in preparation ) and will not be discussed further here .",
    "although the quality of the mrk  279  spectrum is far lower than that of mrk  421 ( w05 ) , the differences between the local absorption seen along the two lines of sight are striking .",
    "while the velocity of the mrk  421   absorption is near zero and thus can not be distinguished from the low and high ",
    "velocity  seen in the spectrum , the mrk  279 and  velocities are significantly different .",
    "furthermore , the derived doppler parameters of the  absorption along these sightlines  @xmath100  and @xmath68  for mrk  421 and mrk  279 respectively  differ substantially . in both cases association of the  with any  component",
    "is ruled out and the derived temperature , density , and column density limits are consistent with each other ( though with large errors ) .",
    "however , the strong discrepancy between the velocity dispersions of the two absorbers suggests that their origins may differ .",
    "such a difference in origin may not be surprising , given the large ( @xmath101 ) separation between the two sightlines .",
    "the unique properties of the absorption components along the mrk  279 sightline provide some tantalizing clues as to the origin of the local host gas . taking all components into account ,",
    "this sightline exhibits high negative  velocity emission ( complex c ) ,  absorption at a similar velocity , and broad , possibly redshifted  absorption .",
    "if complex c is indeed nearby whim gas that has cooled and is falling onto the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then its presence could indicate the presence of a large  scale whim filament in the same direction . in this interpretation ,",
    "the large nonthermal doppler parameter of the  absorption could be a result of velocity shear , due either to the hubble expansion over a scale of @xmath16mpc ( with a corresponding density of @xmath102@xmath79 , assuming @xmath55 , pure hubble broadening and a metallicity of @xmath103 solar ) or the natural velocity distribution expected from infalling gas , or a combination of both",
    ". the negative  velocity would then be gas that has `` broken off '' from the filament and is now falling onto the galaxy , with the  at the same velocity representing the cooling component of the gas .",
    "the velocity of the local standard of rest is approximately perpendicular to the cmb rest frame in this direction , so no significant additional velocity shifts are expected in an igm scenario .",
    "such a picture is consistent with the general picture of galaxy formation and accretion of gas onto galaxies from the igm , and the temperatures and densities inferred from the x - ray absorption are consistent with those expected from the whim . however , unlike the mrk  421 sightline , the simulations of @xcite do not predict high column densities of  in this direction ( though this may be due to the limited resolution of the simulations ) .",
    "furthermore , aside from complex c there are no known structures in this direction that might indicate the presence of a local filament  @xcite note that the canes venatici galaxy grouping is centered on this sightline at @xmath104 , but this is far higher than the velocity of the  absorption .    given these caveats and the large uncertainties on the x - ray measurements (",
    "indeed , only one @xmath1 absorption line has been strongly detected ) , the absorption could also originate locally in hot galactic halo or coronal gas . as discussed previously",
    ", such an origin would require the  to be a completely separate component from any of the other observed components ( , low and high  velocity ) along this line of sight .",
    "of course , there is also the possibility that the   absorption actually consists of multiple unresolved components , in which case a multiphase solution may reconcile the discrepancy with the   absorption .",
    "all line ratio calculations were performed under the assumption of ionization equilibrium , so nonequilibrium scenarios could provide substantively different predictions as well .",
    "more detailed modeling and simulations of both the galactic and igm gas distributions will be necessary to determine which scenario is most likely , and most consistent with the data .",
    "long  duration  grating observations of the bright agn mrk  279 reveal the presence of strong  k@xmath0 absorption at a redshift consistent with zero .",
    "a fuse spectrum of the same source shows several additional  components at velocities near zero . through kinematic , curve  of  growth , and ionization balance modeling ,",
    "we conclude the following :    1 .",
    "a direct @xmath23 analysis of the  spectrum coupled with absorption line models constrains the doppler parameter of the  absorption to be @xmath68  and @xmath69 .",
    "this latter range is unlikely due to the extremely high  column densities required to produce the strong absorption feature .",
    "2 .   the  doppler parameter limits are inconsistent with the measured @xmath47 values for any of the @xmath36  absorption components .",
    "additionally , the centroid of the  k@xmath0 line is inconsistent ( at the @xmath105 level ) with that of the , indicating that the  is not associated with _ any _ local  component .",
    "3 .   if the  absorption is associated with a broad , undetected  absorption line , then a large doppler parameter ( @xmath106 ) is required to provide a single  phase solution for the , , and  column densities .",
    "this large value of @xmath47 could be a result of either microturbulence , velocity shear from infalling gas , or broadening due to the hubble expansion over a path length of a few mpc . if the line is purely hubble  broadened , at @xmath55  a pathlength of 3mpc and density of @xmath107 is implied ( assuming an oxygen abundance of 0.3 times solar ) .",
    "4 .   the large velocity dispersion , possible redshift , and lack of association with any galactic absorption components ( as well as the proximity of hvc complex c ) indicates that this x - ray absorption may be from a large  scale nearby whim filament ; however , a galactic corona origin can not be ruled out with the current data .",

    "<S> we present an improved method for placing limits on the doppler parameter and column density of a medium when only one unresolved line can be measured ; this method is applied to the  absorption seen here , indicating that the  doppler parameter is inconsistent with that of any low  velocity ( galactic thick disk ) or high  velocity  ( ) component . </S>",
    "<S> direct association of the  with the  is further ruled out by the high temperatures required to produce the observed /  ratio and the significant velocity difference between the  and  lines . </S>",
    "<S> if the  absorption is associated with a very broad , undetected  component , then the absorption must be broadened by primarily nonthermal processes . </S>",
    "<S> the large velocity dispersion and possible slight redshift of the  absorption ( as well as limits on the absorber s temperature and density ) may be indicative of a local intergalactic medium origin , though absorption from a hot , low  density galactic corona can not be ruled out . </S>"
