    "absorption spectra of qsos sample the distribution and physical state of intervening gaseous material in the early universe . damped ly@xmath7 systems ( log @xmath8@xmath9 20.3 @xmath10 ) are particularly important since they are believed to originate within young galaxies or galaxy building blocks .",
    "the simple ionization state and high column densities within these systems enable the determination of accurate abundances for many species .",
    "metallicities are commonly based on zn ii and s ii measurements , while fe - peak elements , eg .",
    "cr ii , fe ii , and ni ii , are used to infer depletion estimates of dust grain formation .",
    "abundances of @xmath7-process elements , eg .",
    "si ii , mn ii , and ti ii , may reflect the importance of high - mass stars to the enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) within the absorbers .",
    "the excitation of c i fine - structure levels depends upon the gas pressure .",
    "also , redshifted cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) photons excite c i more efficiently than the present - day cmbr due to the predicted temperature dependence on redshift , @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , measurements of c i excitation in damped ly@xmath7 systems can yield sensitive upper - limits on the temperature of the cmbr in the past , testing the fundmental prediction of simple big bang cosmologies that the universe cools as it expands .",
    "neutral species like c i are associated in the milky way ism primarily with dense , molecule - rich lines of sight . only three high - redshift c i absorbers are known ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , consistent with the apparent lack of molecules in many damped ly@xmath7 systems . in this letter",
    "we report the unexpected detection of c i absorption at @xmath12 toward the qso pks 1756@xmath2237 .",
    "pks 1756@xmath2237 ( @xmath13 ) was observed may 30 and 31 , 1997 using the w. m. keck observatory i 10-m high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires , @xcite ) for two hours .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio varies from @xmath14 5 at the blue end to @xmath9 25 at longer wavelengths .",
    "two slightly offset grating tilt angles yielded complete spectral coverage from 3190  5055   with a resolution of 35,000 ( fwhm @xmath15 8.5 km s@xmath16 ) .",
    "full details of the spectra extraction and reduction procedures , along with a complete analysis of all the observed spectral features , will be presented in our companion paper ( @xcite ) . among the surprises found in the @xmath12 absorption system",
    "are several ni ii lines , fe ii @xmath01611 , and c i @xmath171657,1560 .",
    "none of these were expected to be present because of the low h i column density in this absorber , log @xmath8  @xmath14 19.5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows these lines plotted versus heliocentric corrected rest vacuum velocity along with c ii * @xmath18 and si ii @xmath01527 .",
    "we have examined the entire spectrum for other absorption systems which may confuse individual features in the @xmath12 absorber .",
    "the only possibility is a system @xmath19 , probably associated with the qso , which could be contaminating our c i @xmath01560 line profile with si ii @xmath01527 absorption .",
    "however , we discount it as insignificant because this absorber has a high ionization state and the corresponding c ii @xmath01335 line , expected to be much stronger than si ii @xmath01527 , is quite weak ( @xmath20 20 m ) .    in this letter",
    "we largely restrict our analysis to the weak features in figure [ fig1 ] which trace the highest column density neutral cloud harboring c i. equivalent widths ( @xmath21 ) are measured by direct integration across the line profiles .",
    "statistical @xmath21 errors are estimated from the signal - to - noise ratio in the adjacent continuum ( @xcite ) . to account for continuum placement uncertainties",
    "we inflate the errors @xmath22 to equal 150% of the formal statistical values . the resulting rest equivalent width measurements and column densities resulting from a linear curve - of - growth ( @xmath23 )",
    "are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the good @xmath24 agreement among different absorption lines from the same species suggests that most of these weak features are unsaturated",
    ". therefore our column density measurements will be largely insensitive to the adopted model line profile .",
    "our three - component voigt profile absorption model is given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "we have convolved this model with a gaussian instrumental @xmath25-value of 5.1 km s@xmath16 to produce the superimposed profiles presented in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the total model column density in all three velocity components is given in the last column of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "note that the c i absorption , which presumably arises from the densest material , is present only in the central narrow velocity component .",
    "fe ii , ni ii , and si ii are dominant ionization stages in neutral h i material and thus measure gas - phase abundances .",
    "fe and ni are both fe - peak elements and deplete readily onto dust grains in the milky way ism .",
    "si is formed via the @xmath7-process and is much less susceptible to dust , but its abundance relative to fe and ni may depend on star formation history . for these reasons ,",
    "the interpretation of relative abundance ratios is complicated ( eg .  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmic abundances for si , fe and ni have relative values of @xmath26 ( @xcite ) while our observed relative abundances ( table [ tab1 ] ) are @xmath27 .",
    "the observed @xmath28 enhancement of fe over si is probably not significant since the si ii @xmath01808 feature is 75% deep and therefore possibly saturated .",
    "however , the observed deficit of ni with respect to fe is more likely to be real .",
    "the fe abundance arises from the very weak fe ii @xmath01611 feature which is unaffected by saturation .",
    "therefore the fe ii column density uncertainty is simply the 14% equivalent width measurement error .",
    "we estimate the ni ii column density @xmath29 uncertainty to be @xmath30 3.6% from a weighted average of the six linear curve - of - growth @xmath29 values .",
    "this leads to an observed ni / fe abundance ratio of @xmath31 , significantly below the cosmic ni / fe value of 0.055 .",
    "since both fe and ni are fe - peak elements , this observed deviation in the relative gas - phase abundances from the cosmic value is likely due to depletion onto grains .",
    "diffuse clouds in the milky way ism come in roughly three categories with different physical conditions and dust depletion properties . in order of increasing temperature and decreasing density ,",
    "these are cool disk clouds , warm disk clouds and halo clouds with gas - phase ni / fe values of 0.012  0.035 , 0.028  0.035 , and 0.026  0.046 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "our measured ni / fe abundance ratio is completely consistent with galactic dust depletion , perhaps suggestive of warm disk gas .",
    "unfortunately , our data do not extend to long enough wavelengths to cover zn ii and cr ii .",
    "these lines should be easily detectable , and the relative abundance ratios ni / zn , fe / zn or cr / zn show a more pronounced variation with ism environment because zn is observed to deplete very little , if at all , onto dust grains ( eg .  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we report the very surprising detection of c i ground - state absorption in the @xmath12 gas cloud ( figure [ fig2 ] , table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "since the lines are somewhat saturated , we have applied a @xmath32 km / s gaussian curve - of - growth to our equivalent width measurement errors to estimate the uncertainty in our model column density value ( table [ tab2 ] ) , yielding @xmath33 @xmath10 .",
    "we do not detect any c i * excited - state lines . while in the galactic ism",
    "the dominant c i excitation mechanism is neutral particle collisions , at high redshift the cmbr will make a non - negligible contribution to the population of the @xmath6 level . the amount of pumping is given by the boltzmann equation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the frequency of the energy separation between the ground and first - excited states , @xmath36 k ( @xcite ) , and the present - day cmbr temperature @xmath37 k ( @xcite ) . replacing the number density ratio @xmath38 by the observable quantity @xmath39 in equation [ eqn1 ] , we predict an excited - state column density of @xmath40 @xmath10 . on figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we superimpose the predicted c i * absorption profiles . as can be seen , the detection limit of our data is just above the c i * line strengths produced by the redshifted @xmath41 k cmbr .    to improve our c i * detection limit ,",
    "we have shifted the observed data points to a common velocity scale for each of the four excited - state features ( for the c i * @xmath42 doublet we use an @xmath43-value weighted average line center ) .",
    "this average c i * spectrum is shown in the inset to figure [ fig2 ] , where we have superimposed the predicted c i * profile produced using the same stacking method .",
    "the rms error of the inset stacked spectral region ( s / n @xmath15 45 ) corresponds to an equivalent width error over nine pixels of 0.75 m .",
    "we inflate this @xmath44 by 50% for the same reason as before and adopt a @xmath29 uncertainty in the stacked c i * equivalent width of 1.1 m .",
    "the stacked c i * profile has an equivalent width of 2.1 m , which is consistent with no local excitation of the c i fine - structure levels above cmbr pumping at the @xmath28 level .",
    "however , since inspection of the stacked c i * spectrum suggests that some absorption might be present , although at somewhat less than our @xmath28 level , we have elected to adopt a 3@xmath3 detection upper - limit for this stacked c i * feature of @xmath45 m , which implies a 3@xmath3 c i * column density upper - limit of @xmath46 @xmath10 .",
    "this leads to a 3@xmath3 upper - limit on the c i excitation temperature in the @xmath12 absorber toward pks 1756@xmath2237 of @xmath4 k. the stacked profile for this @xmath47 detection limit is shown by the dashed line in the inset to figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "in addition to measuring the cmbr temperature , our c i fine - structure population measurement allows us to determine the physical conditions within the absorbing gas cloud . for collisional excitation by hydrogen atoms , we employ the rate coefficients reported by @xcite . for uv pumping ,",
    "we solve the detailed balance population equations for the 200 strongest c i uv lines ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and measure the uv field in units of the wj1 average interstellar radiation field ( @xcite [ table 9 ] , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the absence of cmbr pumping and collisional excitation",
    ", we find a 3@xmath3 upper - limit on the uv field within the @xmath12 absorber of @xmath48 times the galactic uv radiation field . alternatively , if collisions alone populate the @xmath6 level and the gas kinetic temperature is 10 k , typical of cool disk clouds , the hydrogen atom density is ( 3@xmath3 upper - limit ) @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "the c i collisional excitation rate is very sensitive at low temperatures .",
    "for example , at a slightly higher temperature ( 15 k ) the density limits are reduced significantly ( @xmath51 @xmath50 ) . at kinetic temperatures similar to less dense clouds or halo clouds ( 100 or 1000 k )",
    "the upper - limits are further decreased to @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath50 .",
    "these limits become more interesting when one includes the considerable contribution to c i * excitation by the high redshift cmbr . as a result , observations of c i fine - structure lines in qso absorbers can yield far more sensitive probes of the physical conditions within distant gas clouds than similar observations within the milky way can provide . for example , if we assume the cmbr temperature at @xmath12 is given by the predicted big bang value of 7.291 k , we find that our uv field and hydrogen atom density upper - limits are substantially lower .",
    "with cmbr pumping , the ambient uv field must be less than ( 3@xmath3 ) @xmath54 galactic fields , @xmath55 @xmath50 , @xmath56 @xmath50 , @xmath57 @xmath50 , and @xmath58 @xmath50 .    in a survey of 27 galactic stars using the _ copernicus _ satellite ,",
    "@xcite did not report an excitation temperature lower than 40 k and excited - state lines were detected in 23 lines of sight .",
    "however , excitation temperatures were not determinable for nearly 25% of their sample , and all four of the sightlines lacking c i * absorption had @xmath59 values that were comparable to or below that found in the @xmath12 absorber .",
    "because of the redshifted cmbr , our limits on the physical conditions within the @xmath12 absorber are 23 times lower than the values in these four milky way sightlines .",
    "it is perhaps too early to tell whether high - redshift c i absorbers are similar to milky way low column density sightlines , or if there is a deficit of high column density c i absorbers toward qsos .",
    "the discovery of more high - redshift c i qso systems will eventually answer the latter question , while higher quality c i spectra of the milky way ism are required to address the former .",
    "the presence of weak , singly - ionized metal lines and c i argue strongly that the @xmath12 absorber toward pks 1756@xmath2237 has been erroneously classified as a moderately low column density system and we have assumed it is in fact damped .",
    "our spectral data extend far enough into the blue to cover the h i absorption feature , and we have attempted to verify the validity of this claim .",
    "the ly@xmath7 line , smoothed and rebinned to 20% the resolution , is presented in figure [ fig3 ] with model voigt profiles for the originally reported @xmath60 ( @xcite ) and a damped ly@xmath7 absorber superimposed .",
    "the data are noisy , the ly@xmath7 absorption is located near the blue wing of the qso ly@xmath7 emission ( @xmath61 ) , and it extends across two echelle orders , all of which complicate the continuum placement . for these reasons , we do not claim a conclusive h i column density measurement .",
    "however , we believe there is sufficient evidence to reclassify this system as a damped ly@xmath7 absorber with @xmath20 610 times more neutral material than previously reported .    the authors wish to thank the staff at wmko for their excellent technical assistance in executing the observations .",
