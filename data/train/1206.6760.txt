    "the coexistence of different fundamental orders in solids and their mutual interaction have attracted attention of physicists and chemists for more than a century .",
    "magnetoelectricity and the coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity have inspired experimentalists and theorists because of many novel physica phenomena that arise from the complex cross correlations between magnetic and electric orders as well as the potential of these multiferroic materials for future applications in form of magnetoelectric sensors or new memory elements @xcite .    with",
    "the discovery of ferroelectricity induced as a secondary order parameter by an inversion symmetry breaking magnetic order in tbmno@xmath11 @xcite , the interest in multiferroic magnetoelectric compounds has been revived and the research in the field has made significant progress since then .",
    "the transverse helical spin structure is one of the candidates to induce ferroelectricity whenever the spin lattice coupling is strong enough to cause the cooperative ionic displacements resulting in a macroscopic electrical polarization .",
    "some typical examples of spin - helical multiferroics are tbmno@xmath11 @xcite ,",
    "ni@xmath11v@xmath12o@xmath13 @xcite , and mnwo@xmath2 @xcite . the important role of helical magnetic orders in inducing ferroelectricity in multiferroics has been theoretically studied within the ginzburg - landau model @xcite or microscopic theories @xcite .",
    "the origin of helical magnetic orders is frequently found in magnetic frustration , either due to geometric constraints ( for example antiferromagnetic interactions on a triangular lattice ) or because of competing exchange interactions . in frustrated systems , there are several magnetically ordered phases that are very close in energy and they compete for the ground state .",
    "small perturbations can therefore control the magnetic phases and stabilize one or the other of the competing orders .",
    "this results in an extreme sensitivity of most multiferroic materials with respect to magnetic or electric fields @xcite , external pressure @xcite , and ionic substitutions @xcite . while the magnetic field couples to the ordered moments affecting their orientation and changing the magnetic structure , the application of external pressure compresses the lattice and tunes the microscopic exchange interactions and anisotropy parameters . whereas the control of microscopic interactions via the application of pressure is indirect and limited by the lattice compressibility , the substitution of the magnetic ions by other ions with different spins , exchange couplings , and anisotropy constants allows for a more targeted control of the magnetic interactions .",
    "the ideal multiferroic compound for investigating the effects of substitutions is mnwo@xmath2 .",
    "also known as the mineral hbnerite , mnwo@xmath2 crystallizes in a monoclinic structure ( space group p 2/c ) . at low temperature , several magnetic phase transitions and multiferroic properties",
    "have been reported @xcite .",
    "the spins of the only magnetic ion , mn@xmath14 , form different frustrated orders upon decreasing temperature because of competing magnetic exchange interactions . a sinusoidal magnetic order with an incommensurate modulation defined by the vector @xmath15 sets in at t@xmath16=13.5 k @xcite .",
    "the mn - spins of this af3 phase are collinear and they are confined to the @xmath6 plane at an angle of 34@xmath17 with the @xmath9axis . at t@xmath18=12.6 k , the spins form a non - collinear order by tilting partially toward the @xmath5axis . the magnetic order in this af2 phase",
    "is described by a spin - helix with the same propagation vector , @xmath19=@xmath20 . since the helical order breaks the spatial inversion symmetry , the af2 phase is also ferroelectric with a polarization vector pointing along the @xmath21-axis , in perfect agreement with the spin - current model @xcite and the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite . only at lower temperature , at t@xmath22=7.5 k ,",
    "the magnetic order locks into a commensurate structure described by the vector @xmath23 .",
    "the order in this af1 phase shows the highly frustrated @xmath24 spin sequence which preserves the spatial inversion symmetry .",
    "therefore , the af1 phase is paraelectric .    the complex phase sequence is a direct consequence of a high degree of frustration in the magnetic subsystem .",
    "the frustration originates from competing exchange interactions @xcite and results in several magnetic states having almost the same energy and competing for the ground state .",
    "recent neutron scattering experiments have revealed the long - range character of the magnetic interactions involving up to 11 different exchange coupling constants and the spin anisotropy to explain the low - energy magnetic excitations @xcite . replacing the magnetic mn ion by other transition metal ions with different spin ,",
    "exchange coupling , and anisotropy parameters will tune the various magnetic and multiferroic phases and , possibly , reveal new physical phenomena in frustrated systems .",

    "the substitution of fe@xmath14 ( spin 2 ) for mn@xmath14 ( spin 5/2 ) has shown an interesting magnetic phase diagram @xcite with coexisting phases at some critical fe concentrations @xcite .",
    "the multiferroic properties of mn@xmath0fe@xmath25wo@xmath2 have been investigated earlier @xcite and it was shown that the substitution of more than 4 % fe suppresses the multiferroic af2 phase . on the contrary , the replacement of nonmagnetic zn@xmath14 in mn@xmath0zn@xmath25wo@xmath2 did stabilize the af2 phase as the ground state and the commensurate ( @xmath24 ) af1 phase was completely suppressed @xcite .",
    "a similar effect was also observed in the co substituted compound , mn@xmath0co@xmath25wo@xmath2 , based on magnetic and neutron scattering experiments of polycrystalline samples @xcite .",

    "these seemingly conflicting results indicate an extreme complexity of the multiferroic phase diagram of mn@xmath0co@xmath25wo@xmath2 and warrant further exploration of single crystals of various co concentrations .    in order to study the multiferroic and magnetic states and the polarization rotations between @xmath5 and @xmath9axes of mn@xmath0co@xmath25wo@xmath2 in more detail",
    ", we have investigated the full doping range of mn@xmath0co@xmath25wo@xmath2 between x=0 and x=0.3 through magnetic , dielectric ( polarization ) , and heat capacity measurements .",

    "a large number of single crystals of mn@xmath0co@xmath25wo@xmath2 with fourteen different compositions x between 0 and 0.3 have been grown in a floating zone optical furnace .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction was used to check the phase purity of the polycrystalline feed rod before the crystal growth .",
    "no impurity phases could be detected within the resolution of the spectra .",
    "the chemical composition and the co content of the single crystals were verified by energy - dispersive x - ray ( edx ) measurements testing up to 15 different spots of a single crystal .",
    "for the 2 % co sample the actual co content was 2.6 % , slightly higher than the nominal substitution level .",
    "for all other samples the co content was close to the nominal composition within the error limits of the edx data . in the following sections , we will use the nominal composition to distinguish between different substitution levels .",

    "single crystal laue diffraction was employed to determine and confirm the crystalline orientations .    for dielectric and ferroelectric polarization measurements ,",
    "small plate - like samples were cleaved or cut from the bigger single crystal .",
    "silver paint was used for electrical contacts .",
    "the contact area was about 10 to 15 mm@xmath31 and the sample thickness was typically less than 0.5 mm .",
    "the sample was mounted on a home - made probe inserted into the physical property measurement system ( quantum design ) for precise control of temperature and the speed of temperature change .",
    "the spontaneous polarization was measured through the pyroelectric current method using the k6517a electrometer ( keithley ) .",
    "the experimental protocol was chosen to diminish any artificial contributions to the current as follows : the sample was cooled from 30 k ( above t@xmath16 ) in an electric field of about 3 kv / cm to low temperature while measuring the current . after releasing the applied voltage and shortening the contacts for several minutes at the lowest temperature , the pyroelectric current was measured upon increasing temperature .",
    "the rate of temperature change was 1 k / min in all experiments .",
    "the polarization is than calculated by integrating the current from high temperature ( in the paraelectric state ) to low temperatures .",
    "the cooling data for the polarization have been found consistent with the ( zero electric field ) warming data , but they reveal large thermal hysteresis effects in some part of the phase diagram .",
    "the bias electric field during cooling ( 3 kv / cm ) has to be high enough to ensure the alignment of the fe domains .",
    "this was verified by measuring the fe polarization after cooling in a reduced electric field of 2 kv / cm resulting in the same magnitude of the fe polarization .",
    "some experiments had been conducted in cooling in a negative ( sign - reversed ) electric field and the obtained polarization was of equal magnitude but of opposite sign , as expected in a fe state .",

    "the @xmath5axis magnetic susceptibilities in this range of co substitutions are shown in fig .",
    "the relatively sharp decrease of @xmath32 below t@xmath18 disappears above x=0.075 and it changes into a plateau - like feature that dominates the low - temperature behavior of the susceptibility .",
    "the low - t plateau exhibits additional anomalies in form of small step - like changes of @xmath32(t ) for x@xmath360.12 suggesting additional transitions or changes of the magnetic orders and a more complex magnetic phase diagram in this doping range ( details are discussed below ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that the angular dependence of both components is exactly the same implying a similar temperature or magnetic field dependence with different magnitudes of the polarization values ( according to the different prefactors in equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) ) .",

    "this unusual behavior may indicate a temperature dependent tilt of the helical plane below 8 k away from the optimal orientation .",
    "the @xmath8axis component exactly mimics the temperature dependence of p@xmath46 at a smaller scale , as is expected from equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . due to this low - temperature tilt",
    ", the maximum polarization can not be obtained for x=0.075 in zero magnetic field .",

    "if @xmath75 , @xmath76 systematically decrease with x , both equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are expected to also give rise to a significant component p@xmath47 , which was not experimentally observed .",
    "the question of whether the two contributions to p@xmath47 accidentally may cancel each other has yet to be explored .",
    "another possibility for the decrease of @xmath3(x ) in this section of the phase diagram could be an increase of the ellipticity ( @xmath99 ) of the spin helix with x , reducing the prefactor in equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "if @xmath100=0 , the magnetic order is collinear and no polarization is allowed .",
    "the true nature of the magnetic order in the af5 phase can only be revealed by detailed neutron scattering experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the decrease of p@xmath46 and p@xmath50 again diminish the stabilizing energy of the multiferroic state arising from the magnetoelectric coupling term in the free energy expansion .",
    "therefore , another instability causes the polarization to flop back toward the @xmath5axis ( for x@xmath360.15 ) .",
    "a sizable value of the ferroelectric polarization along the @xmath5axis is recovered and the multiferroic state is stabilized with regard to the nearly paraelectric state close to x=0.135 .",
    "the further decrease of p@xmath47 is driven by the competition with the commensurate and paraelectric af4 magnetic structure that extends to lower temperatures and coexists with the helical phase below t@xmath18 .",
    "the phase boundary is right at x=0.15 , as previous neutron scattering data of mn@xmath101co@xmath102wo@xmath2 @xcite have revealed the coexistence of a sizable amount of af5 phase with the arising af2 phase ( with @xmath5axis polarization ) . from the above discussion",
    "it is now obvious that the af5 phase at x=0.15 ( which was shown to be the major phase at low temperatures ) does not generate any significant polarization , but it reduces the af2 phase to a minor phase .",
    "this explains the small value of p@xmath47 ( shown in fig .",
    "3c ) as compared to the values for x@xmath360.17 .",

    "the multiferroic state ceases to exist and the only magnetically ordered state is the commensurate and collinear af4 phase , the same phase as in cowo@xmath2 .",
    "the change of magnitude and orientation of the ferroelectric polarization as function of x is explained by the rotation of the spin helix driven by the anisotropy of the magnetic ions ( co@xmath14 vs. mn@xmath14 ) .",
