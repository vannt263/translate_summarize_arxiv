    "we show that in most cases , the set of biaccessible external angles has hausdorff dimension strictly between @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we will use the term _ biaccessibility dimension _ for the hausdorff dimension of biaccessible angles .",
    "an external angle @xmath13 is biaccessible ( in parameter space ) if there is another angle @xmath14 such that the parameter rays of @xmath13 and @xmath14 land at the same point .",

    "we show that the hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles in parameter space is @xmath2 , but give upper bounds away from @xmath2 for all sets in parameter space that avoid a neighborhood of @xmath15 .",
    "biaccessibility is of interest from various points of view .",
    "the topology of julia sets , and of the mandelbrot set , can be described by the knowledge which rays land together ( at least under the assumption of local connectivity ) .",
    "further applications of biaccessibility of external angles ( and rays ) are in mating constructions @xcite .",
    "biaccessible angles have been studied in terms of lebesgue measure on @xmath16 , in particular by smirnov @xcite and zdunik @xcite : for any polynomial julia set that is not an interval , the set of biaccessible angles on @xmath16 has @xmath2-dimensional lebesgue measure zero . in other words ,",

    "recently , thurston studied the concept of _ core entropy _ of polynomial julia sets , and this is closely related to our biaccessibility dimension .",
    "thurston and hubbard asked whether core entropy , or equivalently our biaccessibility dimension , depended continuously on the polynomial ( this became a $ 100-dollar - bet between them ) .",
    "this question was to some extent answered by penrose in his phd .",
    "thesis @xcite .",
    "we take this a step by showing that the biaccessibility dimension depends in a certain hlder continuous fashion on the external angle defining a quadratic polynomial ; in independent work with dudko and tiozzo , we also show continuity with respect to the complex parameter @xmath17 of @xmath18 ( in preparation ) .    in this paper , we will focus on the hausdorff dimension of the set of external angles in @xmath16 , both for the dynamical and the parameter space .",
