    "the argo - ybj experiment , promoted and funded by the italian institute for nuclear physics ( infn ) and by the chinese academy of sciences ( cas ) in the framework of the italy  china scientific cooperation , has operated at the yangbajing cosmic ray laboratory ( tibet , pr china , 4300 m a.s.l . , 606 g / cm@xmath0 ) from november 2007 till february 2013 . as typical of an air shower array apparatus , it has benefited from a large field of view ( @xmath1 2 sr ) and a high duty cycle ( @xmath3 ) , that allowed a continuous monitoring of the sky in the declination band from -10@xmath4 to 70@xmath4 .",
    "the two key features , namely the dense sampling active area and the operation at high altitude , allowed the study of the cosmic radiation at an energy threshold of a few hundred gev .",
    "argo - ybj has been proposed as an experiment capable of investigating a wide range of fundamental issues in cosmic ray and astroparticle physics at a relatively low energy threshold : high energy @xmath5-ray astronomy , at an energy threshold of a few hundred gev ; search for emission of @xmath5-ray bursts in the full gev - tev energy range ; cosmic ray ( cr ) physics ( energy spectrum , chemical composition , @xmath6 ratio measurement , shower space - time structure , multicore events , p - air and pp cross section measurement ) starting from tev energies ; sun and heliosphere physics above 1 gev .",
    "the detector could measure in different energy ranges , according to the way of operation , which essentially means the minimum measurable spatial density of particles . in scaler mode , in order to lower the energy threshold down to 1 gev @xcite , the total counts on sub - units of 44 m@xmath0 are measured every 0.5 s , with limited information on both space distribution and arrival direction of the detected particles . in shower mode , position and arrival time of the charged particles are measured , then the arrival direction of the primary particle is determined by a fast timing technique @xcite .    in shower mode argo - ybj",
    "can determine the number of particles in the shower either by counting the number of fired pick - up strips ( digital readout ) or measuring the total charge induced by the particles passing through the detector ( analog readout ) .",
    "the maximum particle density which can be measured is different for the two cases , simply depending on geometry in the first case ( 23 strips / m@xmath0 ) or on electronics in the second case ( up to many 10@xmath7 /m@xmath0 ) , corresponding to a maximum detectable energy of a few hundred tev in the first case and to many pev in the second case .    from 2007 to the end of operation",
    "argo - ybj has been operated in scaler mode and in shower mode . at december 2009",
    "the analog readout was made operational so increasing the maximum achievable energy up to many pev . due to the dimension of the detector ,",
    "the gamma astronomy studies are limited to energies @xmath8 20 tev @xcite , well addressed by the digital readout ( see @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we will consider the major results obtained so far by argo - ybj on the cr physics and the new opportunities offered by the analog mode of detector operation .",
    "* using the strip multiplicity spectrum measured by argo - ybj the light - component ( proton and helium ) spectrum of the primary cr in the energy region 5 - 200 tev has been evaluated by using a bayesian approach @xcite , so bridging for the first time direct and indirect measurements below 100 tev , region not accessible by other eas experiments .",
    "the argo - ybj data agree remarkably well ( within about 15@xmath9 ) with the values obtained by adding up the proton and helium fluxes measured by cream , both concerning the total intensities and the spectrum slope , so confirming the cream finding that the proton and helium spectra , from 2.5 to 250 tev , are both flatter compared with the lower energy measurements . later on the energy spectrum of proton and helium",
    "has been measured below the so - called `` knee '' , from 100 to 700 tev , by using a hybrid experiment@xcite made of a wide field - of - view cherenkov telescope @xcite and the argo - ybj carpet .",
    "the light component has been well separated from other cr components by using a multi - parameter technique where the analog information has been used for the first time .",
    "a highly uniform energy resolution of about 25@xmath9 was achieved throughout the whole energy range ( 100 - 700 tev ) .",
    "the measured spectrum agrees in both spectral index and absolute flux with the spectrum obtained by argo - ybj alone in the lower energy range from 5 tev to 200 tev .",
    "since proton and helium nuclei are the bulk of the cr at energies below the knee ( 3@xmath10 10@xmath11 ev ) , the study of their spectrum in this energy region is of primary importance . * basing on the cr flux attenuation for different atmospheric depths , i.e. zenith angles , and exploiting the high detector accuracy in reconstructing the shower properties at ground , argo - ybj has measured the production cross section between 1 - 100 tev cr protons and air nuclei @xcite .",
    "the analysis results have been also used to estimate the total proton - proton cross section at center - of - mass energies between 70 and 500 gev .",
    "the total proton - proton cross section has then been inferred from the measured proton - air production cross section by using the glauber theory .",
    "the result is consistent with the general trend of experimental data , favoring an asymptotic ln@xmath0(s ) rise of the cross section . *",
    "argo - ybj has reported @xcite the observation of anisotropic structures on a medium angular scale as wide as @xmath1 10@xmath4 - 45@xmath4 , in the energy range 10@xmath12 - 10@xmath13 ev .",
    "the intensity spans from 10@xmath14 to 10@xmath15 , depending on the selected energy interval and sky region . for the first time",
    ", the observation of new msa structures throughout the right ascension region 195@xmath4 - 290@xmath4 has been observed with a statistical significance above 5 s.d .. at higher energies both the eas - top @xcite and icecube @xcite experiments observed significant anisotropy around 400 tev . at this energy ,",
    "the signal looks quite different from the modulation observed up to 50 tev , both in amplitude and phase ; it suggests that the global anisotropy may be the superposition of different contributions from phenomena at different distances from the earth . * in the argo - ybj experiment , for the first time , the geomagnetic field ( geomf ) lateral stretching is observed @xcite at small distances from the shower core .",
    "this effect has been suggest by cocconi @xcite who supposed that the lateral displacement induced by the earth s magnetic field is not negligible with respect to the coulomb scattering when the shower is young .",
    "the non - uniformity in the azimuthal distribution has been deeply studied by argo - ybj concluding that it is well described by two harmonics : the first one of about 1.5@xmath9 and the second one of about @xmath16 .",
    "the first harmonic is due to the geomf ; the second one is the sum of the magnetic and detector effects .",
    "the phase of the first harmonic can be used as a marker of the absolute pointing of an eas array and , if any , can be used to apply a simple correction to the absolute pointing .",
    "the argo - ybj experimental results represent the first evidence of the charge density reduction near the eas axis due to the geomf",
    ".    with the analog readout in operation on 5800 m@xmath0 argo - ybj can extend its cr physics results at higher energies ( @xmath17 tev ) , so reaching the knee region of the cr spectrum , and cope with new physics items .",
    "the energy spectrum of all cr primaries , the all - particle spectrum , will be measured up to the knee region and the evolution of the different components will be investigated too with special attention to the light component . in this respect",
    "we notice the methodological difference with respect to the sampling apparatus , in fact argo - ybj will use only information provided by the very near region of the core , that essentially means truncated size , local age and particle density at the core position .",
    "improvements are expected on the p - air cross section measurement , that is the extension to center - of - mass energies in the tev region .",
    "the possibility of performing this measurement actually strongly relies on the knowledge of the chemical composition around the knee , specifically of the light component , which is still matter of debate and investigations .",
    "so the light component and the p - air cross section measurements look as intimately correlated and will represent a key item in the argo - ybj investigations . considering the geometry of the detector , the core region",
    "is measured with unprecedented detail and the very forward region of the interaction can be studied .",
    "it will be interesting to see how well the different models will describe the data at higher energies .",
    "in this context it is worthwhile to note that the proton - air inelastic cross section measured by the argo - ybj experiment in the energy range 1 - 100 tev has been found in good agreement with the values set in the corsika / qgsjet code , and that , according to the results shown in@xcite , the qgsjet and sybill models provide the same description of the longitudinal development of the shower below a few hundred tev .    due to the size of the detector , then to the statistics of collected data , it will be almost impossible to detect the cr anisotropy signal at high energies especially considering the level of 10@xmath14 reported @xcite , even using not perfectly internal events .",
    "the study of the geomf effect on the shower development are expected to be performed at higher energies , in fact an azimuthal modulation was already observed not only at the yakutsk array for eas with energies above 50 pev @xcite and at the alborz observatory for energies above 100 tev @xcite , but also in radio experiments @xcite .",
    "shower events with multiple core structure , or multicore events , have been observed and investigated by many experiments with different techniques , namely emulsion chambers @xcite and hadronic calorimeter @xcite .",
    "those events are typically explained within the framework of jet production , which is essentially provided by the leading particle interaction with the air target nuclei , the separation between the cores being related to the @xmath18 of the leading particle .",
    "the argo - ybj carpet with its huge surface ( @xmath19 ) allows the measurement of events with cores separated up to 100 m , so providing a good opportunity to measure very high @xmath18 events @xcite .",
    "events at high @xmath18 are a perfect tool to investigate hadronic interaction models or even new physics . in this respect also",
    "the study of double front showers , at high energy , would be a check for some exotic physics @xcite .",
    "measuring the shower core region will allow the study of local clustering phenomena of particles in the shower that could have a strong correlation with the mass of the primary hadron ; in fact this phenomena should be enhanced around the core region @xcite . in this paper",
    "the detector layout is described in @xmath202 while the main features of the analog signal from the rpc are discussed in @xmath203 .",
    "the @xmath204 copes with the question of the intrinsic linearity of the rpc detector and results are reported on a specific test - beam .",
    "then in @xmath205 the trigger of the experiment and the related electronics are introduced .",
    "the architecture of the charge readout system and the local trigger that enables the charge readout on the single cluster are discussed in @xmath206 , while in @xmath207 the logic operations of the charge readout system are presented focusing on synchronization , data collection and data packing .",
    "the main operations of the daq control system concerning the analog readout ( managing , calibration and monitoring ) are described in @xmath208 .",
    "then , in @xmath209 , the calibration chain of the analog information is presented and the stability of the detector is discussed .",
    "checks of consistency and the final performance of the analog readout of the detector are shown in @xmath2010 .",
    "a summary of the experimental results is given in @xmath2011 while the conclusions are drawn in @xmath2012 .",
    "the argo - ybj detector @xcite , hosted in a building at the yangbajing cosmic ray observatory , consists of a central carpet @xmath21 78@xmath2274 m@xmath23 , made of a single layer of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) with @xmath2193@xmath9 active coverage , enclosed by a guard ring partially instrumented ( @xmath2120@xmath9 ) up to @xmath21110@xmath22100 m@xmath23 .",
    "the apparatus has a modular structure , the basic data acquisition unit being a cluster ( 7.6@xmath22 5.7 m@xmath23 ) , made of 12 rpcs ( 1.25 @xmath222.80 m@xmath23 each ) .",
    "the full detector has 153 clusters ( 130 in the central carpet , 23 in the guard ring ) with a total active surface of about 6700 m@xmath23 , as shown in fig[lay - out - argo ] .",
    "each rpc is read out by means of 80 pick - up strips ( 61.8@xmath226.75 cm@xmath23 , the spatial pixels ) facing one side of the gas volume .",
    "the fast - or signal of 8 contiguous strips defines the logical pad ( 61.8 @xmath22 55.6 cm @xmath23 , the time pixel ) which is used for timing and triggering purposes .",
    "any manifold coincidence of fired pads of the central carpet ( @xmath25 ) above a given multiplicity threshold ( @xmath26 ) , namely @xmath27 in a time window of 420 ns , implements the inclusive trigger that starts the event data acquisition .",
    "the apparatus , in its full configuration of 153 clusters , has been in smooth and stable data taking since november 2007 till february 2013 with a duty cycle @xmath28 .",
    "the trigger threshold is @xmath29 ( @xmath30 gev for primary photons ( protons ) ) and the corresponding trigger rate is @xmath21 3.5 khz .",
    "the high granularity of the detector and its time resolution provide a detailed three - dimensional reconstruction of the shower front .",
    "the digital pick - up of the rpc , which has a density of 23 strips / m@xmath23 , can be used to study the primary spectrum up to energies of a few hundred tev ; above these energies its response saturates @xcite . in order to extend the measurable energy range and fully investigate pev energies , where particle densities at the core position are larger than 10@xmath31/m@xmath23 ,",
    "each rpc has also been equipped with two large size electrodes of dimensions 1.23 @xmath22 1.39 m@xmath23 .",
    "these pick - up electrodes , called big pads ( bp ) , face the other side of the rpc gas volume ( see fig.[rpclayout ] ) and provide a signal whose amplitude is expected to be proportional to the number of charged particles impinging on the detector . + the bp and the 40 corresponding strips see the same signals provided by particles impinging on the rpc and detected by it .",
    "the rpcs are operated in streamer mode , with a gas mixture of argon ( 15@xmath9 ) , isobutane ( 10@xmath9 ) and tetraflouroethane ( 75@xmath9 ) .",
    "the operating voltage is 7.2 kv .",

    "it can be seen that in case of no foam there is a much faster increase of the measured amplitude , which is higher by a factor 2@xmath453 in the efficiency plateau ; the foam instead stabilizes the signal and makes the plateau extension more evident .",
    "similar behavior has been observed for some parameters like strip multiplicity and pulse height of the strips with respect to the thickness of the foam layer @xcite .",
    "in order to check the intrinsic linearity of the rpc response up to particle densities of a few 10@xmath7/m@xmath0 , which is the density at the core of showers induced by primary cosmic rays of pev energies , a test - beam on small rpcs has been performed in october 2009 at the beam test facility ( btf)@xcite , part of the dafne - factory complex ( infn national laboratory of frascati , italy ) .",

    "the energy was in the range 450 - 500 mev .",
    "the rpcs were operated with the same mixture used in the argo - ybj experiment and a check of their performance was done before the test beam by stacking the 4 rpcs in a vertical telescope , then measuring the efficiency and the operation voltage with cosmic muons crossing the telescope . above the knee voltage , @xmath1 9.2 kv , in the plateau region , the efficiency was @xmath50 95@xmath9 .",

    "the voltage of operation during the test , the measured amplitude of the pad signal for a single particle crossing the detector was 3.7 @xmath51 0.1 mv .",
    "a small lead glass calorimeter , located just beyond the rpcs ( see fig.[btf_assonometria ] ) and aligned with its major axis along the beam direction , was used to measure the particles exiting the rpcs .",
    "the lead glass block is from the former opal experiment @xcite and has the shape of a truncated prism of schott sf57 lead glass ; the block length is 37 cm , corresponding to 24 radiation lengths , with a base of @xmath52 cm@xmath0 .",
    "the light signal is read by a hamamatsu r2238 photomultiplier .",
    "the data acquisition was performed by a custom system managed by a motorola 6100 cpu and housed in a vme crate .",

    "up to 30 particles on 15 cm@xmath0 there is no evidence of deviation from linearity behavior of the rpc , which means linearity response up to density of about @xmath54 .",
    "of course this value is conservative because the particle density of the beam spot is not properly uniform .",
    "the trigger of the experiment is generated by the digital signals sent by the front - end boards mounted on the rpcs .",

    "the analog detector is able to operate at different energy ranges , owing to the flexibility of the readout electronics . at the most sensitive scale , the digital readout and the analog readout perfectly overlap so providing a powerful instrument of calibration .",
    "the calibration procedure is described in all details ; it is self consistent because relies on two independent measurements of the same quantity , being the rpc signals independently readout by the strips and by the analog pickup electrode ( bp ) .",
    "no additional information is needed .",
    "the error on the measurement of the number of particles ( n ) crossing the bp is essentially determined by the intrinsic fluctuation of the rpc signal , which is about 20@xmath9 for a single streamer at the operational conditions of the experiment , while decreases as @xmath59 .",
    "the contribution to the error of the electronic calibration is less than 0.5@xmath9 , while the electronics itself shows a quite good stability , or a seasonal variation of the response which is less than 1@xmath9 .",
    "the mean signal of the single particle , the gain , is determined with an uncertainty of about @xmath60 on the single run base , or a few hours ; its mean time derivative is @xmath61 which also represents the detector stability .",
    "more than 95@xmath9 of the 3120 bp in the central carpet of argo - ybj have been calibrated with the described procedure .",

    "the spectrum of this variable , as obtained by data analysis of showers with core in a fiducial area of the argo - ybj carpet , has shown no systematic effects related to the use of different scales , that is a perfect matching in the overlapping regions of this distribution .",

    "the analog readout of the argo - ybj rpc detector , put in operation on december 2009 , allows for a very detailed and precise measurement of the number of charged particles around the core of air showers induced by @xmath32 100 tev primaries .",
    "this imaging is achieved by means of an array of 3120 pixels ( called bigpad ) of 1.7 m@xmath0 each , densely distributed over a 93@xmath9 active area of about 5770 m@xmath0 .",
    "the most important features of this device can be summarized as :    * each pixel is instrumented to count the number n of charged particles with a resolution 20@xmath62 + 4.4@xmath9 where the first term is related to the fluctuation of the streamer formation in the gas gap of the rpc , while the second term accounts for the uncertainty in the absolute calibration functions and control of the environmental parameters . as far the long - term stability of the detector , the m.i.p .",
    "signal shows a mean variation of of + 4.3@xmath9/year ; * the dynamic range of each pixel extends as far as particle densities of 2@xmath63 and more , allowing to measure the number of charged particles around the core of air shower from pev primaries with an accuracy @xmath64 ; * the performance of this device does not depends on the air shower incidence angle at least up to 50 degrees .    in consequence ,",
    "since the position of the detector at high altitude makes possible to sample ground particles near the shower maximum , thus reducing significantly the effects of fluctuations , one can reasonably predict accurate measurements around the knee of the primary cosmic ray spectrum with unprecedented resolution .",
    "preliminary results presented at icrc 2013 @xcite as well as the study of the pmax distribution discussed in this paper confirm the excellent performance of the detector and of its analog readout .",
