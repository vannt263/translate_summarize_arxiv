    "<S> _ phase coherence and superfluidity are two characteristic and most intriguing features of quantum fluids . </S>",
    "<S> both phenomena are marked by a complex - valued order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the order parameter is different in superconductors , helium superfluids or ultracold gases , but the most important common feature is a rigid ( due to inter - particle interactions ) local phase ( arising from macroscopic coherence ) whose gradient is proportional to the superfluid velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this describes a class of universal phenomena such as the quantization of vortices or the stability of persistent currents .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important and counterintuitive consequences of a non - vanishing order parameter with a non - linear dynamics is the josephson effect between two superfluid bulks . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> bosonic josephson junctions ( bjjs ) created with two weakly linked , dilute bose - einstein condensates , are characterized by a rich class of dynamical regimes @xcite . in the  plasma \" oscillations , both the relative population and the relative phase between the two bulks oscillate sinusoidally at a frequency decreasing with the height of the tunneling barrier renormalized by the strength of the interatomic interaction . in the  </S>",
    "<S> ac \" josephson regime , the relative phase increases in time due to an external force ( induced for instance by a linear potential superimposed to a symmetric double - well ) . in the  macroscopic quantum self - trapping \" regime ( mqst ) , the relative phase increases in time driven by a difference in internal energy between the two bulk regions of the weakly linked system . </S>",
    "<S> the internal energy difference is induced by a self - sustained relative population imbalance due to the intrinsic non - linearity of the system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath0 modes with a relative phase oscillating around an average value @xmath0 are also possible . </S>",
    "<S> most of these effects have been recently experimentally observed with bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in double - well  @xcite and optical lattice potentials  @xcite , in the internal bec dynamics between two hyperfine levels  @xcite as well as in different physical systems like two weakly coupled polariton condensates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the  ac \" and the  mqst \" regimes are both characterized by a  running \" relative phase monotonically increasing with time . </S>",
    "<S> the phase is of course single valued . in particular , when it is calculated in a closed loop around a zero - density region of the order parameter the phase can return to its original value @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the concept of phase slippage induced by the creation of a singly quantized vortex crossing the barrier or the bridge weakly linking two superfluid bulks , introduced to explain the  ac \" josephson effects of superfluid helium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an experimental signature of phase - slips during josephson oscillations has been found as jumps of the macroscopic current between two weakly linked superfluid helium reservoirs driven by an external induced pressure difference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this behavior was observed only far outside the josephson tunneling regime , whereas in the latter the current shows smooth sinusoidal oscillations .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamics of phase - slippage in the macroscopic quantum self - trapping regime of two weakly linked bose - einstein condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a 3d case and show that the topological excitation responsible for the phase slippage is a vortex ring crossing the junction by radially shrinking ( expanding ) to ( from ) a point at the center . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe a non - trivial vortex dynamics just before the onset of mqst , where the large amplitude population oscillations are driven by vortices floating in the low density barrier region . </S>",
    "<S> the creation of topological excitations and their dynamics are both very fast compared to the relative phase and population dynamics among the two bulk regions . </S>",
    "<S> this justifies the use of a two - mode approximation ( tma ) , where the dynamics is described only in terms of collective variables . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the full numerical solution , in the tma the phase slippage takes place through the creation of a dark soliton - like structure which creates a zero - density surface across the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> tma also , somehow surprisingly , reproduces well the sudden jump in the value of the local superfluid velocity inside the barrier induced by a phase - slip . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account a correction factor that renormalizes the interaction term  @xcite , we show that the predictions of the tma are also quantitative .    </S>",

    "<S> these peaks are caused by vortex rings entering the junction region but not crossing it completely , thus not giving rise to a @xmath38 phase - slip . </S>",

    "<S> taking again the pendulum analogy , this corresponds to a situation where the pendulum no longer oscillates but it keeps going about in circles with the pendulum angle ( the relative phase ) steadily increasing with time . in this case , the velocity is maximum at the equilibrium position ( minimum population imbalance ) .    the linear growth of the phase difference can be understood in terms of phase slips , which are reflected in sharp decreases of the local velocity when the imbalance has a minimum , as seen in the left panels of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> these sharp decreases are caused by vortex rings that have now enough energy to completely cross the junction , leaving the @xmath38 phase - slips behind . </S>",

    "<S> an example of vortex passage is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figst ] , for initial condition @xmath41 , where the three phase snapshots show a vortex ( which results from the projection of the vorticity line of the @xmath40 part of the ring vortex on the plane @xmath14 ) crossing the junction from inside to outside . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the junction does not lie exactly in the @xmath39 plane , but it is slightly shifted . </S>",
    "<S> this is an effect of the imbalance combined with the nonlinear interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> when the vortex ring is created within the barrier ( process ( i ) above ) it has to expand outwards to produce the phase slip . in this process </S>",

    "<S> however , in the tma the sharp decrease is not caused by a vortex ring but by a ( dark ) soliton - like structure occurring when the relative bulk phase reaches @xmath58 , since the modes @xmath59 and @xmath60 are static and do not evolve in time .    </S>",
    "<S> the linear increase in the local velocity with a sudden switch of sign at @xmath58 requires a precise interplay between the dynamics of the current and the density . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , while both decrease when approaching the critical point , the density decreases at a faster speed so as to provide a linear increase of the local superfluid velocity @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this process continues up to the point where the density vanishes and the phase slip takes place . </S>",
    "<S> it is somehow surprising that such a delicate interplay can be captured by the two - mode approximation , where the spatial wave - functions have a frozen profile and the dynamics is expressed only in terms of collective variables .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion and conclusions_. we have studied the relation between phase slips and topological excitations in a bjj undergoing josephson oscillations . in our 3d configuration , the dynamical regimes of the junction can be related to different dynamics of vortex rings . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the nature of the topological excitations depends on the effective dimensionality of the system , being a soliton in 1d and a couple vortex - antivortex in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> this zoology exists because , depending on the dimensionality , it can be energetically favorable to create a phase slip with an instantaneous cut between the two bulks through a dark soliton rather than with a shrinking ring vortex . </S>",
    "<S> the net effect , in all cases , is the @xmath38 phase slip . in mqst regime of the junction </S>",
    "<S> , the speed of the vortex crossing the barrier is quite higher than the collective population / phase dynamics and can be considered instantaneous in the tunneling time scale . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as far as the collective variable dynamics is concerned , the details of the topological excitations are not important and the tma can provide a good approximate description of the system also in higher dimensions .    compared to superfluid helium , the advantage of studying the phase slippage mechanism in becs is that their microscopic dynamics is quantitatively well described by the the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamical analysis has allowed us to clarify that the phase slippage is the net effect of the annihilation of a ( ring)vortex and an anti(ring)vortex or of a shrinking ring - vortex , and not a single topological excitation crossing the barrier region as previously suggested in the literature . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , a bec junction might allow the experimental observation of such topological excitations in the josephson regime . </S>",
    "<S> our results can also clarify the role of topological excitations in the experimental observation of mqst in polariton systems @xcite . to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we notice that we have focused our analysis at the onset of the self - trapping regime but it will be interesting to investigate the phase slip dynamics of the `` ac '' regime as well as of the @xmath0-oscillations .    </S>",
