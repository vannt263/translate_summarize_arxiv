    "soon after the first large hadron collider ( lhc ) heavy ion results were launched , it became evident that the hydrodynamic picture of the collision processes , confirmed at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , , is clearly seen also at much higher energy .",
    "this conclusion is based on two classes of observables .",
    "the first one is related to the azimuthal anisotropy of particle spectra expressed basically through its second harmonics , or @xmath0 coefficients .",
    "the obtained lhc results for the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath1 at a given centrality bin were found to be similar to the ones at rhic , except for the higher momentum range at lhc @xcite .",
    "this is the evidence of the same hydrodynamic mechanism of the anisotropy formation as at rhic .",
    "the second type of observables deals with the direct measurements of the space - time structure of nucleus - nucleus collisions by means of the correlation femtoscopy .",
    "the femtoscopic spatiotemporal scales of the systems are typically represented in terms of the interferometry radii .",
    "the hydrodynamic predictions @xcite for @xmath2 behavior of the radii at the lhc energies were confirmed by the alice experiment @xcite . the most impressive hydrodynamic prediction @xcite , that the ratio of the two transverse interferometry radii , _ out _ to _ side _ , will drop in the whole @xmath2- interval with increasing collision energy and reaches a value close to unity at the lhc , has been discovered experimentally @xcite .",
    "now the hydrodynamic - based approach to ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions becomes the `` standard model '' for these processes .",
    "note , however , that the details of this approach did undergo essential modifications during the last decade and even now they are different in different models . the first attempts to describe successfully @xmath0 coefficients @xcite at rhic",
    "were based on the perfect hydrodynamics with an equation of state ( eos ) corresponding to a first order phase transition",
    ". however , a simultaneous description of @xmath0 , particle spectra and femtoscopy scales within the unified initial conditions collided with an invincible problem . only in recent years",
    "have the main factors that make it possible to describe simultaneously the spectra and femtoscopic scales become clear .",
    "they are @xcite : a relatively hard eos because of a crossover transition ( instead of the 1st order one ) between quark - gluon and hadron phases , the presence of the prethermal anisotropic transverse flow developed to thermalization time , an `` additional portion '' of the transverse flow caused by the shear viscosity effect and fluctuations of the initial conditions .",
    "an account of these factors gives the possibility to describe well the pion and kaon spectra together with the femtoscopy rhic data within a realistic freeze - out picture with a gradual decay of the fluid into observed particles @xcite .",
    "in fact , at the moment there is no real unique model of heavy ion collisions .",
    "different hydrodynamic - based approaches use different initial conditions as well as different final state treatments for the matter evolution , different eos , etc . in this paper",
    "we make the next step towards converging to the `` standard model '' .",
    "we analyze a possibility for a uniform description of the soft observables in the hydrokinetic model of a+a collisions at rhic and lhc , namely , a simultaneous description of the hadronic yield ; pion , kaon , and proton transverse momentum spectra at different centralities ; @xmath1 coefficients ; and femtoscopy scales in a+a collisions at rhic and lhc . for this aim",
    "we use the hydrokinetic model ( hkm ) @xcite in its hybrid version ( hhkm ) @xcite , which allows one to apply hydrodynamics also at the late non - equilibrated stage of gradual system decay .",
    "it gives the possibility to switch correctly to the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) cascade at any spacelike hypersurface , in particular , at an isochronic one .",
    "we can compare the results also with a pure hybrid model where the hydrodynamics and hadronic cascade are matching just at a non - space - like hypersurface of the chemical freeze - out or on the isochronic hypersurface .",
    "the goal of this paper is to fix the hkm by applying it to describe the known experimental data at rhic and lhc and based on this to predict still unmeasured observables .",
    "the results presented here are correlated with similar studies performed in other hydro based models , different from hhkm in various aspects @xcite .",
    "all the results presented in this work are calculated for the midrapidity region with the approximation of longitudinal boost - invariance .",
    "the hydrokinetic code @xcite is developed now to simulate the full 3 + 1d matter evolution and it allows one to analyze the central , noncentral , and peripheral heavy ion collisions .",
    "the formation of the flow anisotropy depends on the initial eccentricity @xmath3 which is defined by the centrality of collisions . even at the maximal centrality the event - by - event fluctuations of the initial conditions ( ic )",
    "lead to some nonzero effective eccentricity .",
    "these fluctuations appear due to chaotic distribution of nucleons ( or local color charges ) in colliding nucleus and , as the result , the nucleon scattering positions fluctuate from event to event . in the hydrodynamic picture",
    "such initial eccentricity of the ( mean ) energy density profile transforms into a flow anisotropy even at zero impact parameter .",
    "the effect persists for non - central heavy ion collisions , where it leads to some systematic increase of mean initial eccentricity .    in this work",
    ", we employ the monte - carlo glauber ( mc - glauber ) ics .",
    "the mean transverse density of nucleons in nuclei is defined as @xmath4 + 1 } dx_l,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the atomic number ; for au+au collisions one uses @xmath6 , then @xmath7fm , @xmath8 fm .",
    "constant @xmath9 is defined by the normalization condition .",
    "in the so - called glauber model the multiplicity ( or entropy ) produced in collisions of two nucleus is defined , roughly , by the number of participating nucleons contained in the overlapping distributions ( [ t ] ) for each nuclei shifted by the value of the impact parameter . in the mc - glauber approach , instead of utilization of the mean participant density ( [ t ] ) ,",
    "one starts the monte - carlo procedure with eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) as the distribution function of the random variable - nucleon number at point @xmath10 .",
    "the finite size of the nucleon can also be taken into account ; this slightly modifies the average nucleon distribution compared to eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) . the collision criterion for a pair of nucleons in each event",
    "is based on the value of nucleon - nucleon cross section @xmath11 at the corresponding collision energy .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon collisions result in deposition of a certain amount of multiplicity ( entropy ) to different cells in a transverse plane .",
    "the contributions to multiplicity ( entropy ) from the `` hard '' elementary collisions and from the `` soft '' ones are different : the former are proportional to the number of binary collisions while the later are associated with the number of wounded nucleons , or participant number @xcite .",
    "the glissando code @xcite allows one to calculate the @xmath10 distribution of both numbers utilizing the mc - glauber procedure .",
    "we use this generator and suppose that the initial entropy profile in the transverse plane at midrapidity is proportional to a linear combination of the density of wounded nucleons and that of binary collisions : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the normalization constant , @xmath14 for top rhic energy and @xmath15 for 2.76 tev lhc energy are fixed from the description of centrality dependence of multiplicity of all charged hadrons at midrapidity @xmath16 in a hydro+cascade model @xcite .",
    "the mc - glauber model requires the ( inelastic ) nucleon - nucleon cross section @xmath17 and the number of the nucleons @xmath18 in the colliding nuclei as input .",
    "we fix this to ( @xmath19 mbarn , @xmath20 ) for au - au collisions for top rhic energy , and ( @xmath21 mb , @xmath22 ) for the lhc case .",
    "different centrality classes are defined via the corresponding cuts on the number of participants , as shown in table [ table - cuts ] .",
    "the other choice is to introduce cuts on impact parameter instead ( which is associated with a cut on average number of participants ) ; however , we found that it does not lead to visually different profiles .",
    ".cuts on the number of participating nucleons from mc - glauber model , corresponding to different centrality classes for au - au and pb - pb collisions at top rhic and 2.76 tev lhc energies , respectively . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     thus , one can conclude that annihilation processes in urqmd are essential for successful reproduction of the @xmath23 ratio at the lhc energy .",
    "when going to noncentral collisions , the @xmath23 ratio slightly increases up to @xmath24 for 20 - 30% centrality ( consistently with alice data ) , which should be the result of fewer inelastic processes owing to decreased effective volume at the hadronization hypersurface . because charged hadron density at midrapidity for 20 - 30% central pbpb collisions at 2.76 tev is close to the one for most central collisions at top rhic energy , one can also conclude that inelastic processes in the cascade play a similar role also at rhic , modifying particle number ratios and , in particular , decreasing the @xmath23 ratio .",
    "it is worth noting that the value of the effect depends on the dynamics of the fireball that defines a duration of the afterburn stage and so can differ at rhic and lhc energies .        ,",
    "@xmath25 and ( anti)protons at top 2.76 tev lhc energy and centrality c=30 - 40% , calculated in the hhkm model with the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig - lhc ] and compared to alice data @xcite , scaledwidth=50.0% ]      in fig .",
    "[ fig - lhc ] we show the comparison model / experiment for 2.76 tev lhc energy .",
    "the experimental data are related to elliptic flow coefficients from the four - particle cumulant method , @xmath26 @xcite and interferometry radii to the most central events measured by the alice collaboration @xcite .",
    "in addition , as for the rhic case , in fig . [ fig - v2ident - lhc ] we compare the elliptic flow @xmath27 of charged pions , kaons and antiprotons for the centrality 10 - 20% , measured by alice @xcite . on the last plot ,",
    "the experimental points are somewhat above the hhkm calculations , and the probable source of the difference is the two - particle cumulant method , which give systematically bigger elliptic flow than the four - particle cumulant method used for the analysis of the elliptic flow of all charged hadrons . to compare with the experimental antiproton spectrum from alice , we exclude all feed - downs from weak decays , except for @xmath28 . as a result , we observe some difference compared to alice for the mass dependence of the effective temperature ( inverse slope ) of the transverse momentum spectrum : the resulting antiproton and kaon spectra are too flat in the model , while the pion spectrum is reproduced much better in a wide @xmath2 region .",
    "the reason for such a mismatch could be that the imitation of the viscous effects by the initial transverse flow is not so effective at lhc than at rhic because of a more protracted ( viscous ) hydrodynamics stage .",
    "concerning interferometry results , in hhkm we get systematically lower @xmath29 and @xmath30 radii than the alice data for larger @xmath2 ; however , they are within the experimental error bars almost in all @xmath2 regions .",
    "note that the rise of interferometry volume observed by the alice collaboration is well reproduced in hhkm ( see also ref .",
    "because we keep untouched the main model parameters when passing from rhic to lhc energies , except for a general normalization for increased @xmath31 , contribution from binary collisions , and the baryonic chemical potentials at freeze - out , one can conclude that the soft physics at rhic and lhc is similar .",
    "the above results are presented for perfect fluid dynamics of quark - gluon plasma and nonequilibrium evolution of hadronic gas after the chemical freeze - out .",
    "as it is known , quantum theory gives the limitation on the shear viscosity coefficient @xmath32 , more exactly , on the minimal ratio @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is entropy density .",
    "the inclusion of the shear viscosity in the boost - invariant hydrodynamic models affects the final hydrodynamic flow in the following way : it increases the radial and decreases elliptic flows .    in this work",
    "we do not utilize viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "however in this section we try to demonstrate the influence of the above - mentioned effects on observed transverse spectra , elliptic flows , and hbt .",
    "of course , the conservation laws have to be taken into account to see reliable correlation in modifications of different kinds of observables . for this aim",
    "we use our model with modified ics that affect the final flow in the above - mentioned way .",
    "we found that the artificial addition of a small initial transverse velocity with profile ( [ iflow ] ) can serve for this aim . in this case",
    "the pressure gradient will drop faster in all directions and this reduces an efficiency of the transformation of the anisotropy of initial pressure gradient into the final flow anisotropy @xcite .",
    "formally , when @xmath35 , the anisotropy parameter @xmath36 drops .",
    "from the comparison with the lhc experimental data in fig.[fig - lhc - iflow ] one can see some improvement of the behavior for all the observables , when small initial flow is included with the average value being @xmath37=0.014  0.018 .",
    "namely , the effective temperature of the single - particle transverse spectra at large @xmath2 increases , while the @xmath0-coefficient decreases and @xmath38 ratio becomes lower .",
    "these `` viscous - like '' corrections bring the hope that the good description of the rhic and lhc experiments can be reached within the hkm based on viscous hydrodynamics",
    ". this will be the next step in our study .",
    "we present a consistent description of the transverse momentum spectra for the most abundant hadrons ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , elliptic flow coefficients , and interferometry radii for central and noncentral collisions at the top rhic and lhc energies in the hybrid hydrokinetic model ( hhkm ) .",
    "the latter provides the correct matching of decaying hadron matter evolution with hadronic urqmd cascade at isochronic ( or space - like in general ) hypersurface .",
    "the results are compared with ones obtained at the different matching procedures in hybrid models with the same initial conditions .",
    "it is found that the matching of hydrodynamics with cascade at the chemical freeze - out hypersurface gives the close results to hhkm , while the results are essentially different from both of these models and from experimental data when the matching of thermally and chemically equilibrated hydrodynamic systems with urqmd happens at the isochronic hypersurface .",
    "the initial conditions allowing simultaneous description of the soft observables in ultrarelativistic a+a collisions are associated with the mc - glauber initial entropy density distribution with mixed contributions from wounded nucleon density and density of binary scatterings .",
    "one can see the satisfactory description of the rhic and lhc data within perfect hydrodynamics for the qgp phase , except for some overestimation of @xmath0 coefficients and @xmath42 ratios caused , probably , by neglect of the shear viscosity . as it is known",
    "the latter increases the final transverse flow and damps the elliptic flows .",
    "qualitatively , similar effects can be reached by artificial inclusion of small but non - zero initial transverse flow .",
    "we demonstrate that such an imitation of the shear viscosity indeed improves the @xmath0 coefficients and @xmath42 ratios .",
    "the hadron yields and particle number ratios for most abundant hadrons measured by alice are also well described and explained in the model .",
    "the contributions of different processes at the hadronic cascade stage to the final hadron yields are found .",
    "note that the most of the parameters fixed from agreement with rhic data are applied also for the description of 2.76 tev pb+pb lhc collisions with different centrality classes .",
    "in fact , the only changes are the normalization of initial entropy density distribution , contribution from binary collisions and baryonic chemical potentials at chemical freeze - out , which become zero",
    ". then pion , kaon and ( anti ) proton spectra , @xmath2-differential elliptic flow coefficients , and hbt radii are reproduced well also at lhc .",
    "it is the evidence of the similarity of the soft physics at the rhic and lhc energies .    as the next step it is planned to include some missing features of the hydrokinetics into future versions of the model , namely the prethermal dynamics and viscosity .",
