    "the primary goal of colliding heavy - ions at ultra - relativistic energies is to study nuclear matter under extreme conditions , in which hadronic matter is expected to undergo a phase transition to a new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions , suggests that at high temperatures and energy densities , nuclear matter melts down to this new phase of deconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "recent lattice qcd calculations  @xcite indicate that transition from hadronic matter to qgp occurs at a critical temperature of @xmath2 mev and critical energy density of @xmath3  gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the qgp research programs at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern are on a quest to unearth the physics of deconfinement and vacuum , and to understand how matter behaved within a few microseconds after the birth of our universe . with the first phase of the beam energy scan program at rhic during 2010 and 2011 , data for au+au collisions at a nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) centre - of - mass energy ( @xmath1 )  from 7.7  gev to 200  gev",

    "the lhc has collided pb+pb beams at @xmath1  =  2.76  tev during the first phase of its operation ( 2010 and 2011 ) . during the first year of the second phase of lhc operation in 2015 ,",
    "data for pb+pb collisions at @xmath1  =  5.02  tev are collected .",
    "thus with the combination of rhic and lhc , high quality data for heavy - ion collisions have now been available over quite a broad energy range . at the same time a large number of models have emerged which attempt to analyze and explain the data and extract physical parameters @xcite .",
    "global observables such as charged particle multiplicity distributions , pseudorapidity ( @xmath0 ) distributions , momentum spectra , particle ratios , size of the fireball , and azimuthal anisotropy provide majority of the valuable information for thermal and chemical analysis of the freeze - out conditions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-distribution of charged particles is one of the most basic and most important observables to characterize the colliding system and to understand the phase transition .",
    "all the observables in heavy - ion collisions scale with the number of particles .",
    "so the knowledge of the particle density is essential for validating any measurement .",
    "the pseudorapidity particle density at mid - rapidity , along with transverse energy per particle provides the energy density of the fireball using the bjorken estimation  @xcite .",
    "the pseudorapidity distributions are intimately connected to the energy density of the emitting source and provide an important test - bed for validating theoretical models , which attempt to describe the conditions in the early phases of the collision .",
    "experimental data for @xmath0-distributions have been reported for all the collider energies at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we make a compilation of some of the available data in terms of the variation of pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles with beam energy and collision centrality .",
    "we make a similar study using the string melting mode of the a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model and make a comparison with the available data . in this model ,",
    "different values of parton cross sections are used to explain the data at lhc .",
    "the pseudorapidity distributions , both from data and the ampt model , of charged particles from @xmath1  = 7.7  gev to 2.76  tev are fitted by a double gaussian function .",
    "these parameters show interesting trends as a function of beam energy . extrapolating the parameters to higher energies",

    "it is observed that the pseudorapidity density at mid - rapidity matches well with the recently reported data from alice  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we extract the value of initial energy density for collisions at @xmath1  =  5.02  tev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  ii ,",
    "we discuss the ampt model which is used to compare the data results . in section  iii ,",
    "we present the compilation of pseudorapidity distributions for data and ampt . in section",
    "iv , we make an analysis of the shapes of the pseudorapidity distributions and present the results of the fit parameters .",

    "the ampt model  @xcite provides a framework to study relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it incorporates essential stages of heavy ion collisions from the initial condition to final observables on an event - by - event basis , including the parton cascade , hadronization and the hadron cascade  @xcite .",
    "the model can generate events in two different modes : ( a ) default , and ( b ) string melting ( sm ) .",
    "initial conditions for both the modes are taken from hijing  @xcite , where two wood - saxon type radial density profile are taken for colliding nuclei .",
    "the multiple scattering among the nucleons of two heavy ion nuclei are governed by the eikonal formalism .",
    "the particle production has two distinct sources , from hard and soft processes , depending on the momentum transfer among partons . in the default mode ,",
    "energetic partons cascade through zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) before the strings and partons are recombined and the strings are fragmented via the lund string fragmentation function , @xmath5 where a and b are the lund string fragmentation function parameters , taken to be 0.2 and 2.2 .",
    "art ( a relativistic transport model for hadrons )  @xcite is used to describe how the produced hadrons will interact . in the string melting mode",
    ", the strings produced from hijing are decomposed into partons which are fed into the parton cascade along with the minijet partons .",
    "the partonic matter is then turned into hadrons through the coalescence model  @xcite and the hadronic interactions are subsequently modeled using art .",
    "the default mode describes the evolution of collision in terms of strings and minijets followed by string fragmentation , and the string melting mode includes a fully partonic qgp phase that hadronizes through quark coalescence .    in both the modes of ampt",
    ", boltzmann equations are solved using zpc with total parton elastic scattering cross section , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath8 are the mandelstam variables and @xmath9 is the debye screening mass . here ,",

    "we have carried out a comparison study for different observables by varying @xmath11 and @xmath9 corresponding to 1.5  mb , 3  mb , 6  mb and 10  mb cross sections .",
    "the model therefore provides a convenient way to investigate expectations for a variety of observables with and without a qgp phase .",

    "the magnitude of the dip depends on the particle composition of the charged particles as the dip is more prominent for heavier particles like protons and anti - protons compared to pions .    in the present study",
