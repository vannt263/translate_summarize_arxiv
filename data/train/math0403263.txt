    "it is a long - standing open problem in geometry and number theory to find the densest lattice in @xmath4 .",

    "let @xmath8 denote the covolume of @xmath7 , i.e. , the volume of a fundamental parallelotope or the absolute value of the determinant of a basis of @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath9 is the minimal vector length of @xmath7 , then spheres of radius @xmath10 centered at the points of @xmath7 do not overlap except tangentially .",
    "this construction yields a sphere packing of density @xmath11 since the volume of a unit ball in @xmath4 is @xmath12 , where for odd @xmath6 we define @xmath13 .",
    "the densest lattice in @xmath4 is the lattice for which this quantity is maximized",
    ".    there might be several distinct densest lattices in the same dimension .",
    "for example , the greatest density known in @xmath14 is achieved by at least @xmath15 distinct lattices , although they are not known to be optimal .",
    "( see pages xix and  178 of @xcite for the details . )",
    "we will speak of `` the densest lattice '' because it sounds more natural .",
    "the problem of finding the densest lattice is a special case of the sphere packing problem , but there is no reason to believe that the densest sphere packing should come from a lattice .",
    "in particular , in @xmath16 the densest packing known is the best packing @xmath17 , which is not a lattice packing ( see @xcite ) , and it is conjectured that lattices are suboptimal in all sufficiently high dimensions .",
    "however , many of the most interesting packings in low dimensions are lattice packings , and lattices have strong connections with other fields such as number theory . for example",
    ", the hermite constant @xmath18 is defined to be the smallest constant such that for every positive - definite quadratic form @xmath19 of determinant @xmath20 , there is a nonzero vector @xmath21 such that @xmath22 . finding the maximum density of a lattice packing in @xmath4 is equivalent to computing @xmath18 .",
    "the densest lattice in @xmath4 is known for @xmath23 : the answers are the root lattices @xmath24",
    ", @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath2 . for @xmath31",
    "this is due to gauss @xcite , for @xmath32 to korkine and zolotareff @xcite , and for @xmath33 to blichfeldt @xcite .",
    "however , before the present paper no further cases had been solved since 1935 . in 1946",
    "chaundy claimed to have dealt with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , but his paper @xcite implicitly assumes that a densest lattice in @xmath4 must contain one in @xmath36 as a cross section .",
    "that is known to be false ( see @xcite ) , so the paper appears irreparably flawed .    in each of the solved cases ,",
    "the optimal lattice is furthermore known to be unique , up to scaling and isometries .",
    "this was proved simultaneously with the optimality for @xmath37 , for @xmath38 it was proved by barnes @xcite , and for @xmath33 it was proved by vetinkin @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we deal with @xmath39 ( the theorem numbering is as it will appear later in the paper ) :    the leech lattice is the unique densest lattice in @xmath0 , up to scaling and isometries of @xmath0 .    in terms of the hermite constant , @xmath40 .",
    "we also give a new proof for @xmath2 :    the @xmath2 root lattice is the unique densest lattice in @xmath41 , up to scaling and isometries of @xmath41 .",
    "our work is motivated by the paper @xcite by cohn and elkies ( see also @xcite ) , which proves upper bounds for the sphere packing density .",
    "in particular , the main theorem in @xcite is an analogue for sphere packing of the linear programming bounds for error - correcting codes : given a function satisfying certain linear inequalities one can deduce a density bound .",
    "it is not known how to choose the function to optimize the bound , but in @xmath3 and @xmath0 one can come exceedingly close to the densities of @xmath2 and the leech lattice , respectively .",
    "this observation , together with analogies with error - correcting codes and spherical codes , led cohn and elkies to conjecture that their bound is sharp in @xmath3 and @xmath0 , which would solve the sphere packing problem in those dimensions .",
    "while we can not yet fully carry out that program , in this paper we show how to combine the methods of @xcite with results on lattices and combinatorics to deal with the special case of lattice packings .",
    "we will deal primarily with the leech lattice , because that case is new and more difficult , but in section  [ section : e8 ] we will discuss @xmath2 .",
    "one might hope to use a relatively simple method .",
    "section  8 of @xcite shows how to prove that the leech lattice is the unique densest periodic packing ( i.e. , union of finitely many translates of a lattice ) in @xmath0 , if a function from @xmath0 to @xmath42 with certain properties exists . using a computer",
    ", one can find functions that very nearly have those properties , and the techniques from section  8 of @xcite can then be used straightforwardly to prove an approximate version of the uniqueness result : every lattice that is at least as dense as the leech lattice must be close to it .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that the leech lattice is a strict local optimum for density , among lattices .",
    "thus , if one can show that every denser lattice is sufficiently close , then it proves that the leech lattice is the unique densest lattice in @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , this approach seems completely infeasible if carried out in the most straightforward way .",
    "when one naively imitates the techniques from section  8 of @xcite in an approximate setting , one loses a tremendous factor in the bounds , and that puts the required computer searches far beyond what we are capable of . in this paper",
    "we salvage the approach by using more sophisticated arguments that take advantage of special properties of the leech lattice .",
    "in particular , we make use of three beautiful facts about the leech lattice : its automorphism group acts transitively on pairs of minimal vectors with the same inner product , its minimal vectors form an association scheme when pairs are grouped according to their inner products , and its minimal vectors form a spherical @xmath43-design .",
    "( note that the second property follows from the first , but our work uses another proof of it , from @xcite . )",
    "our proof depends on computer calculations in some places , but they can be carried out relatively quickly , in less than one hour using a personal computer .",
    "the calculations are all done using exact arithmetic and are thus rigorous .",
    "we have fully documented all of our calculations and made available commented code for use in checking the results or carrying out further investigations .",
    "see appendix  [ appendix : computer ] for details .",
    "appendix  [ appendix : background ] contains very brief introductions to several topics : the leech lattice , linear programming bounds , spherical designs , and association schemes . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "the expository article @xcite also provides useful background and context , although it does not include everything we need .",
    "we wish to show that the leech lattice , henceforth denoted by @xmath44 , is the unique densest sphere packing among all lattices in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath7 be any lattice in @xmath0 that is at least as dense as @xmath44 .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath7 has covolume @xmath45 . then the restriction on its density simply means its minimal vectors have length at least @xmath46 .",
    "we first show , using linear programming bounds , that @xmath7 has exactly @xmath47 vectors of length approximately @xmath46 ( called nearly minimal vectors ) , and that the next smallest vector length is approximately @xmath48 .",
    "we rescale those @xmath47 nearly minimal vectors to lie on the unit sphere .",
    "then they form a spherical code with minimal angle at least @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is very near to ( and greater than or equal to ) @xmath51 .",
    "note that in @xmath52 there is a unique spherical code of this size with minimal angle @xmath53 , and it is the kissing arrangement of @xmath44 ; the spherical code derived from @xmath7 should be a small perturbation of this configuration .",
    "using linear programming bounds , we show that the inner products of the unit vectors are approximately @xmath54 .",
    "we prove that if pairs of vectors are grouped according to their inner products , then they form an association scheme with the same valencies and intersection numbers as in the case of @xmath44 , and that it must therefore be the same association scheme .",
    "this isomorphism gives us a correspondence between minimal vectors of @xmath44 and nearly minimal vectors of @xmath7 , such that corresponding inner products are approximately equal .    using this correspondence",
    ", we find a basis of @xmath7 whose gram matrix is close to the gram matrix of a basis of @xmath44 .",
    "finally , from the strict local optimality of the leech lattice we conclude that @xmath7 must in fact be the leech lattice .",

    "we normalize the fourier transform by @xmath67 note also that with this normalization of the fourier transform , the poisson summation formula states that @xmath68 if @xmath69 is a schwartz function , @xmath5 is a lattice , and @xmath70 is its dual lattice .",

    "the calculations required for and are dealt with in ` verifygram.txt ` .",
    "finally , the file ` verifyrest.txt ` verifies all remaining calculations in the paper for the leech lattice case .",
    "many of the calculations in this file could be checked by hand , but that would be unpleasant and error - prone . instead of pari code , this file contains maple code .",
    "maple is less efficient but more flexible , and it seemed easiest to use it for these calculations .",
    "our computer calculations are completely rigorous , in the sense that they are carried out using exact arithmetic and thus avoid traps such as round - off error .",
    "nevertheless , we can not eliminate the possibility of a hardware error or a bug in software beyond our control , such as the operating system or computer algebra program . under these circumstances , even assuming our programs are correctly written they may return incorrect results .",
    "this possibility appears quite unlikely , and we do not consider it a serious worry .",
    "however , we have addressed it by asking dimitar jetchev to translate our programs into the magma computer algebra system .",
    "his translation is contained in the file ` magmacode.txt ` . using it",
    ", we have independently checked our calculations on a different type of processor , a different computer algebra system , and a different operating system .",
    "we have also documented our calculations for the @xmath2 proof .",
    "the details can be found in the files ` e8verifyf.txt ` and ` e8rest.txt ` .",
    "we include fewer comments in these files than in the others , because their structure is parallel to the leech lattice case .",
    "the file ` e8seventh.txt ` contains a proof that @xmath876 works in the @xmath2 case , although we do not require that for the proof of theorem  [ theorem : main2 ] .",
    "in this appendix we collect brief definitions and descriptions of a few of the principal objects and techniques used in this paper .    an _ even unimodular lattice _",
    "@xmath5 is a lattice such that @xmath84 , @xmath877 for all @xmath878 , and @xmath879 for all @xmath880 .",
    "such lattices exist only when @xmath6 is a multiple of @xmath272 . up to isometries of @xmath4 , the unique example when @xmath83 is @xmath2 , and there are @xmath428 examples in @xmath0 , among which the leech lattice is the unique one containing no vectors of length @xmath768 .",
    "see @xcite for more information .",
    "a _ spherical code _ of minimal angle @xmath49 in the unit sphere @xmath78 is a collection @xmath881 of points such that @xmath882 for all @xmath883 with @xmath884 . in other words , no two distinct points of @xmath233 form an angle smaller than @xmath49 centered at the origin .",
    "spherical codes are to @xmath78 as binary error - correcting codes are to @xmath885 , or as sphere packings are to @xmath4 .",
    "the most important approach to bounding the size of spherical codes is _ linear programming bounds _ ( due to delsarte @xcite ; see chapter  9 of @xcite for an exposition ) .",
    "these bounds rely on the following property of the ultraspherical polynomials , which follows from lemma  [ lemma : nonneg ] : if @xmath77 , then for each finite subset @xmath881 , @xmath886 suppose @xmath887 , and that @xmath888 satisfies @xmath889 for @xmath890 $ ] .",
    "then every spherical code @xmath233 in @xmath78 with minimal angle @xmath49 has size bounded by @xmath891 ( assuming @xmath892 ) .",
    "the proof is simple : @xmath893    the most dramatic application of the linear programming bounds for spherical codes is the solution of the _ kissing problem _ in @xmath3 and @xmath0 : how many unit balls can be placed tangent to a central unit ball so that their interiors do not overlap ?",
    "this condition amounts to saying that the points of tangency form a spherical code with minimal angle @xmath894 . in @xmath3",
    "the answer is @xmath767 , and in @xmath0 the answer is @xmath47 . the codes are formed from the minimal vectors in @xmath2 and the leech lattice , respectively ( of course the radius of the sphere involved differs in the two examples ) .",
    "optimality follows from the linear programming bounds by taking @xmath895 in @xmath3 and @xmath896 in @xmath0 .",
    "this most remarkable fact was discovered independently by levenshtein @xcite and by odlyzko and sloane @xcite .    a _",
    "spherical @xmath99-design _ in @xmath78 is a non - empty finite subset @xmath897 of @xmath78 such that for every polynomial @xmath69 of total degree at most @xmath99 , @xmath898 in other words , the average of @xmath103 over @xmath897 equals its average over the entire sphere .",
    "the minimal vectors of the leech lattice form a spherical @xmath43-design , and those of @xmath2 form a spherical @xmath787-design .",
    "a _ @xmath569-class association scheme _ is a set @xmath417 together with a partition @xmath899 such that @xmath900 , @xmath901 iff @xmath902 , and the following property holds .",

    "( that is , @xmath908 depends only on @xmath903 , @xmath904 , and @xmath6 , and not on @xmath270 and @xmath268 . )",
