    "the identified hadron ratios have been measured with all lhc detectors and results were compared with high - energy event generators available in the market@xcite .",
    "the comparison , in general , is not very satisfactory .    in the present paper we would like to use data from the alice experiment performed with @xmath0 interaction of @xmath1 7 tev available energy @xcite to test the particle creation description based on thermodynamical approach .",
    "the standard statistical picture is known to work well in the soft , low @xmath2 , sector of the particle creation process , where the exponential fall of the transverse momentum distribution is observed .",
    "the hard inelastic scattering leads to the quark jet fragmentation with the power - law transverse momentum ( transverse mass ) distributions .",
    "detail studies of the measured charged particle transverse momentum ( transverse mass ) distributions suggested already some time ago that the very good agreement of the invariant differential cross section in the whole transverse momentum range can be obtained with `` an empirical formula inspired by qcd '' from @xcite @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for further discussion and references ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that not only the fit of the simple form of eq.([qcdinpired ] ) works well but the whole theoretical model of particle creation which stands behind it could be successfully applied to the highest available energy data on charged particle transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "the model parameters found in @xcite define the occupation of phase space for given charged particle transverse momentum .",
    "if the picture is self - consistent , the same set of parameters should give correct yields of different kinds of created particles .",
    "it is known that the multiplicities of new created heavy particles are described to some extent by the boltzmann statistical model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the tsallis modification undoubtedly increases the high @xmath2s , and , obviously , the high transverse mass particle abundances .",
    "this should lead to the overabundance of heavy particles .",
    "we would like to look for the possibility to suppress this effect in a consistent way and to see if satisfactory results could be obtained .",
    "the thermodynamical picture of particle creation process in hadronic collisions was the first and quite successful attempt to describe it .",
    "the elaborated and complete theory was presented in series of papers by hagedorn ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the idea of the fireball together with the proposition that `` all fireballs are equal '' gives considerable predictions concerning produced particle spectra .",
    "one of the predictions was that the temperature of the `` hadronic soup '' ( precisely defined ) could not exceed a universal constant @xmath4 of order of 160 mev .",
    "this value comes not as a result of the procedure of parameter adjusting using multiparticle production ( e.g. , transverse momenta ) data , but from examination of elementary particle mass spectrum .",
    "the hagedorn theory were abundant for some time , when more sophisticated , jet or qcd based ideas appeared @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons was the failure of the high - transverse momenta description .",
    "the temperature of the fireball is defined as the parameter in the classical boltzmann exponential term of the probability weights for phase space average occupation numbers .",
    "this gives the ( asymptotic ) form of the distribution of transverse momentum of particles created from decaying fireballs .",
    "it was found that at high and very high interaction energies the predicted exponential fall do not agree with the observed high @xmath5 behaviour .",
    "successes of qcd based description of the hard processes gave deep insight into the nature of physics involved , and belief that this is just the right theory of strong interactions , makes the thermodynamical approach very approximate , simple and naive tool of limited applicability and thus of limited significance .",
    "but on the other hand , the simplicity of the theory and notorious constant lack of the effective qcd theory of soft hadronization processes give a hope that the fireball idea can be enriched , modified and can become important again .",
    "the hagedorn idea was used again to describe the identified particle multiplicities in hadronization both , in @xmath6 annihilation and hadronic collisions .",
    "the _ grand canonical _ formalism of hagedorn was replaced in the serial of papers by becattini and co - workers @xcite by the _ canonical _ one , much relevant for studies of small systems like primary created fireballs for which the requirement of exact conservation of some quantum numbers seems important .",
    "in general , thermodynamics of the system is determined by the partition function which can be written as @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the classical boltzmann factor and @xmath9 and @xmath10 enumerate particle types and momentum cells , @xmath11 is the initial fireball quantum number vector and @xmath12 is the respective vector of the particular state , and @xmath13 is the occupation number .",
    "introducing fourier transform of @xmath14 ( and reducing vector @xmath12 to 3-dimensional : charge , baryon number and strangeness ) eq.([z0 ] ) becomes @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the quantum number vector of the particle @xmath9 and @xmath17 is the weight factor associated with the particle of the type @xmath9 .",
    "the first guess is that it should be equal to @xmath18 and counts spin states .",
    "however , this does not seem to be so simple ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) and other solutions introducing factors responsible for some wave - function normalization , which should disfavour heavier states were found to be preferable by measurements .",
    "we will discuss this point later on .    with the eq.([zq0 ] ) we are ready for detailed numerical calculations .      with the known partition function",

    "the lower is for bosons .",
    "because the @xmath21 factor is expected to be small ( for all particles except pions ) then @xmath22    the conventional boltzmann - gibbs description shown above could be , in principle , modified to allow the description of the systems of not - completely - free particles : the correlation `` strength '' , however defined , was introduced with the help of the new _ non - extensivity _ parameter and the new statistics , which in such case has to be also _ non - extensive_. in the limit of the absence of correlations the new description approaches the boltzmann form",
    ".    there could be infinitely many `` generalized '' statistics which fulfill such requirements .",
    "we choose the one which is simple and has well defined theoretical background . in the present paper",
    "we test the possibility , proposed by tsallis @xcite , based on the modification of the classical entropy definition @xmath23 by the new one @xmath24 with the new parameter @xmath25 called the non - extensivity parameter .",

    "however , the effect of volume @xmath39 have to be taken with care , because the spacial and temporal history of the hadronization process is not exactly known .",
    "it is expected that the canonical picture should take into account the multichain idea ( e.g. , @xcite ) of decomposition of the hadronic soup to chains of independently hadronized objects / fireballs . for the boltzmann statistics , by the definition of extensivity , the sum of many hadron sources is equivalent to one big source @xcite .",
    "this is , in general , not the case of tsallis non - extensive statistics .",
    "but we can say that the strength of the non - extensivity is still not big and the effect of subdivision of the hadronization volume does not change much the conclusion about the identified particles ratios .",
    "another important point , to be mentioned here , is connected to the effect of the canonical treatment of small fireballs which relates to the suppression of strange quark ( and diquark , or strange diquark ) production what was mentioned already in @xcite .",
    "additionally the importance of reaction volume in hadronic collisions in the canonical picture , specially for multistrange particles , like @xmath52 , is discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "we have to say that the changes of the hadronization volume do not act strong on the total multiplicities . the possible small changes which we can study do not effect the particle ratios in a significant way .",
    "detailed studies , however , are needed to answer all questions here .",
    "we can say , that the thermodynamical model predictions are , in a sense , very robust .",
    "they can not be adjusted to the measured ratios , at least with reasonable possible changes of the hadronization parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath25 .",

    "thermodynamical parameter values ( @xmath38 and @xmath25 ) were taken from the literature , and adjusted ( @xmath39 ) to reproduce roughly the charged particle multiplicities .",
    "we have applied there the simply counting of spin states to calculate the weight factor @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and strangeness suppression factor value of @xmath57 acting of strange quark particle contents .",

    "the general statement is that the strange phase space is not fully available for particle production what can be realized by multiplying the partition function by the special factor for each strange valence quark in the particle in question .",

    "if there is enough energy left , further breaks may occur and eventually only on - mass - shell hadrons remains .",
    "the creation of new quark - antiquark pair in the lund model is a kind of the quantum tunneling process , so it is expected that the heavy quark creation is suppressed .",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath83 @xcite additionally , @xmath17 weight factor is related with the spin states of newly created hadrons : for mesons : pseudoscalar and vector states .",
    "the suppression here is not defined in the lund fragmentation model .",
    "counting the spin states gives @xmath84 ratio , but in the jetset model this ratio is eventually close to @xmath85 , according to the tunnelling normalisation.    the situation with baryon creation in the lund model is much more complicated .",
    "the tunneling mechanism is also adopted here .",
    "we have here the probability of string breakup via diquark mode and further combination of quark and diquark .",
    "if we take into account the pop - corn mechanism of diquark breakups and lack of general rules , we can have the number of parameters to be adjusted to the data comparable with the number of measured ratios to be used for this adjustment .",
    "the number of parameters describing the production of baryons measured with good accuracy in the experiments at lhc is at the moment higher then the number of such baryons itself @xcite .",
    "the lund model and particular jetset hadronization generator is used also by the phojet @xcite program package for the recent theoretical examination of the lhc data description and comparison .",
    "some parameters in phojet are different than the default lund model values .",
    "we first discuss the possibility of introducing the strangeness suppression factor @xmath86 for @xmath87 the @xmath88 is the degree of strangeness which is , in fact , not defined , yet .",

    "the alice collaboration published data showing also particle ratios as a function of particle transverse momentum .",
    "taking into account that the modification of the statistics of the multiparticle production process was developed primarily for the transverse momentum description this kind of data could be valuable to verify the model .",

    "this is of course the effect of adding two new parameters and adjusting the model to match the points , but the question if similar modification of the standard boltzmann picture will give similar result is still open .",
    "the modified thermodynamical model parameters found analyzing the transverse momentum distributions measured at 7 tev without any re - adjustment with the standard strangeness suppression factor @xmath99 of about 2/3 and additional suppressions of diquark and strange diquark production were used for the calculations of identified particle multiplicities .",
