    "the wavelength corresponding to @xmath166 might then correspond to the size of the largest non - contacting regions , leading to an increase in @xmath166 as the area fraction increases .",

    "although the relation between area @xmath182 and local load @xmath183 for any individual contact is non - linear in these theories , @xmath184 , the number of contacts of each area rises linearly with load . as the total load increases ,",
    "a contact that already exists will have an increased local load and grow in size .",
    "however , new contacts will form under increasing @xmath6 so that there is a supply of new contact patches with small local loads . under certain favorable conditions ,",

    "these imply that @xmath116 decays more rapidly with wavevector @xmath65 than @xmath113 , but that the change in their ratio is only about a factor of two , no matter how large the system . as a result ,",

    "the new approach can be interpreted as an expansion , in which the perturbation parameter is a screening length which describes the exponential repulsion between two surfaces .",
    "a zero screening length corresponds to hard wall interactions . in this limit",
    "the leading order term of the expansion reduces to persson s theory .",
