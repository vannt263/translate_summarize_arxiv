    "nonresonant light scattering from an ultracold gas can occur in two ways .",
    "the first involves the diffraction of light due to the nonuniform density of the gas , which leaves the gas unchanged , while the second involves the creation of excitations in the gas where the light transfers momentum and/or energy to the gas . in the following",
    "we see how these processes occur when laser light is scattered from atoms in first - order perturbation theory .",
    "we consider light - matter interactions where the atom can be treated as a two - level system , as may be the case because of angular momentum considerations in the dipole approximation .",
    "for example , in @xmath7rb , the transition @xmath8 that is excited by @xmath9-polarized light is a cycling transition , where , because of the polarization of the input light , only one excited state can take part , which in turn can only decay to the initial ground state .",
    "further simplification can be made when the light incident on the atoms is off - resonant , with detuning @xmath10 between the atomic resonant frequency @xmath11 and the input laser frequency @xmath12 . in which case the excited atomic state",
    "can be adiabatically eliminated , giving , in the rotating wave approximation , the following interaction hamiltonian , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the lifetime of the excited state . the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the ground - state atomic - field operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the positive and negative frequency components of the electric field , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    in the interaction picture",
    "we have @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the hamiltonian of the noninteracting light - matter system , and the time evolution operator is given by the integral equation @xmath22 @xcite . for a weak perturbation the evolution of the state",
    "is given approximately by expanding this integral equation to first order , giving @xmath23    we take the initial state of the system to be an atomic eigenstate @xmath24 and a laser represented by the classical field @xmath25 .",
    "the first - order coupling then leads to photons being scattered from the laser into other modes @xmath26 with wave vector @xmath0 , frequency @xmath27 and polarization @xmath28 , resulting in a momentum change @xmath29 and energy change @xmath30 .",
    "the probability at time @xmath31 of the system being in a new atomic eigenstate @xmath32 with an additional photon in the mode @xmath26 is then @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the coupling constant between the electromagnetic field modes and @xmath35 is the unperturbed energy of the state @xmath36 .",
    "the function @xmath37 approaches the dirac delta function @xmath38 as the interaction time @xmath31 approaches infinity , enforcing energy conservation .    for @xmath9-polarized input laser light we can sum over polarizations in the coupling to get @xmath39 .",
    "the total rate of scattering photons with wave vector @xmath0 and frequency @xmath27 of either polarization is then @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dynamic structure factor @xcite .",
    "for a finite - temperature system , in the canonical ensemble with partition function @xmath42 , the dynamic structure factor is @xcite @xmath43 the structure factor can be divided up into two parts , the first with @xmath44 describes classical diffraction , which results in no energy or momentum transfer to the gas , that is , the light scattering is _ elastic_. the second part , where @xmath45 , describes _ inelastic _",
    "light scattering that results in excitations of the gas .    for nonresonant light scattering the frequency change @xmath46 is determined by the difference in energies between the initial and final atom many - body states . for scattering from ultracold atoms",
    "these energy differences are all many orders of magnitude less than the frequency of the input light . to a very good approximation",

    "the static structure factor applies in the perturbative regime , where it has been used successfully to describe neutron scattering from liquid helium @xcite and to calculate the spectrum of light scattered from ultracold gases @xcite , along with the response of ultracold gases to bragg excitation @xcite . in this paper",

    "see how different correlations in different many - body states affect the angular distribution of the scattered light .",
    "for spin - polarized fermions of the same species , @xmath62-wave scattering is prohibited , and for low temperatures the fermionic atoms are approximately noninteracting .",

    "this means that filtering out interband photons before collection ( as may be possible due to their separation in energy by at least the band gap from the other scattered photons ) does not increase the measurement efficiency greatly . in the mott case",
    "above , if we filtered out the interband photons before photon detection the number of repetitions required would be reduced to around 24000 .",
    "similarly for the fermion and superfluid cases above the increase in efficiency is 5% or less .",
    "we have shown how correlations between atoms in optical lattices are reflected in the way these systems scatter light . for the fermi - dirac gas",
    "we have seen that pauli blocking leads to angular dependence of the inelastic light scattering , while for a bosonic superfluid a different angular dependence occurs as a result of interference and enhancement between scattering channels . in the bosonic mott insulating state inelastic scattering",
    "is strongly suppressed by correlations between the atoms in momentum space . we have demonstrated that interband scattering , which has been neglected in other treatments , can significantly change the scattering patterns in a way that is largely independent of correlations within the lattice and temperature .",
    "we have used our theory to test whether light scattering can be used as a thermometer for ultracold atoms , and have shown that interband scattering reduces the efficiency of temperature measurements based on light scattering , particularly in the mott insulator case .",
    "our results suggest that using light scattering to measure the temperature of the mott insulator state will be ineffective , while for the fermi - dirac gas and the superfluid this remains a feasible method .",
    "we thank janne ruostekoski for valuable comments on this work .",

    "<S> we find that light scattering that excites atoms out of the lowest band leads to an increase in light scattering away from the classical diffraction peaks and is largely temperature independent . </S>",
    "<S> this additional light scattering leads to lower efficiency of temperature measurements based on photon counting .    </S>",
    "<S> ultracold atoms in optical lattices exhibit a remarkable range of behavior and have become an indispensable tool for investigating many - body phenomena @xcite . as the gamut of many - body states achieved in experiments with optical lattices expands , </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to consider how to detect and reveal more information about these states . with this goal in mind , many authors have considered the scattering of light by these ultracold gases as a potential way of extracting information .    </S>",
    "<S> bragg scattering , where light scattering from the sample is stimulated by a pair of lasers , is a prominent method that has been investigated as a probe of bosons in optical lattices @xcite , and experiments using bragg scattering have detected signatures of the superfluid and mott insulator states of the bose - hubbard model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another suggested scheme involves light scattering into a cavity , where the strong light - matter coupling encodes information about the many - body state into the distribution of photons transmitted by the cavity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of finite temperature on light scattering has been investigated as a potential probe of temperature for the superfluid and mott cases @xcite and also for the noninteracting fermi - dirac gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently the far field diffraction pattern of a mott insulator was imaged in an experiment where the diffraction peaks were used to detect the spin distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> detection of spin distributions in optical lattices using light - matter interactions has also been considered theoretically @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider what light scattering , which is not stimulated by another laser or by a cavity , tells us about the many - body state . </S>",
    "<S> the aim being to reveal information about the atoms while they remain _ in situ _ with a relatively simple experimental implementation , only requiring a laser to be shone on the atoms , as depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this would remove the need for a cavity or the need to destructively image the atomic sample , which is usually required with bragg scattering ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a recent exception ) . </S>",
    "<S> when scattering is not stimulated there is less restriction on the final energy state of the scattered photons and the full band structure of the optical lattice must be taken into account , something which has been neglected in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a treatment of light scattering from ultracold atoms in optical lattices that includes both the band structure and the effects of nonzero temperature .    </S>",
