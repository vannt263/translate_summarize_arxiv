    "in heavy - ion (  ) as well as in proton - proton ( ) collisions , the measurements related to strange hadrons constitute unique tools to study the physics of the strong interaction . in this respect ,",
    "given their strangeness content , the charged multi - strange baryons ",
    "( @xmath3 ) , ( @xmath4 ) , ( @xmath5 ) , ( @xmath6 )  are of certain importance . the interest in strangeness and specifically in and can be explained mainly by two reasons :    * the initial system formed by the projectiles is free from strange valence quarks , thus the strange quarks that compose the strange hadrons of the final state have to be produced during the process of the collisions ; * due to the identification via weak - decay topology reconstruction , the multi - strange baryons can be studied over a large momentum range , typically from @xmath7  @xmath8 up to @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting @xmath7 spectra then cover the region dominated by the soft processes and reach the energy scale where hard scattering mechanisms may prevail .",
    "a significant part of the investigation in  physics depends on our understanding of the production mechanisms ( soft and hard ) in the system , meaning as they occur in the benchmark system .",
    "the measurement of multi - strange particle spectra in collisions is the topic of this report .",
    "the data presented here are from a minimum bias ( mb ) sample of collisions at @xmath0 = 7 , collected at the lhc @xcite with the alice experiment @xcite during summer 2010 .",
    "the entire statistics presently analysed stands for about @xmath10 mb interactions .",
    "the study makes use of the two alice main tracking detectors placed at mid - rapidity , covering the full azimuth : the inner tracking system , composed of 6 cylindrical layers of high - resolution silicon detectors  @xcite , and the cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite .",
    "the multi - strange hadron identification is performed using a combination of displaced - vertex finding , invariant mass analysis and particle identification ( pid ) method at the single track level ( in this analysis , compatibility selection based on the energy loss measurements from the tpc ) .",
    "the reconstruction of the , , , particles hinges on their respective charged weak decays , the so - called _ cascade _ structures . for each species of interest ,",
    "the main characteristics and utilized decay channels are listed in table [ tab : maire - cascdecaychannel ] .",
    "the anti - baryons are similarly reconstructed via the decay channel involving the charge conjugates .",

    "the protocol to extract the signal counts per @xmath7 interval ( bin ) is also presented in @xcite .",
    "due to the large statistics available for the 7  data sample , and but also and can be studied distinctively . at central rapidity ( ) , the overall raw signal amounts to about @xmath26 counts for , as well as for , and about @xmath27 counts for as well as for its anti - particle .",
    "the upper part of the figure [ fig : maire - fig1-correctedspectra ] shows the four corrected spectra .",
    "they are normalised to the number of inelastic events ( inel ) .",
    "both spectra range from @xmath7 = 0.6 to 8.5 , while the spectra are measured between 0.8 and 5.0 . in order to extract the integrated yields ,",
    "the data points are fitted with a tsallis function @xcite .",
    "the fits result in a good description of data ( @xmath28 close to unity ) and are further used to extrapolate the spectra in the non - measured low @xmath7 region ( @xmath29 of the total @xmath30 for or , @xmath31 for or ) .     as a function of transverse momentum , for , , , measured at central rapidity ( @xmath32 ) in inelastic events at @xmath0 = 7 .",
    "the upper panel shows the corrected spectra for the four different species together with their fits by a tsallis function .",
    "the lower panel presents the ratio between the measured data and the predictions returned by the tune perugia 2011 ( p2011 ) of pythia . ]    note that , provided the difference in the normalisation scheme chosen by alice ( inel ) and cms ( non - single diffractive , nsd ) @xcite , the ( ) spectra by both experiments are found to be in agreement within the limit of uncertainties .",
    "a significant part of our understanding of collisions is based on description by the monte carlo models ( mc ) .",
    "this is especially the case in the _ soft _ regime ( @xmath7@xmath33 2 - 3 ) .",
    "the confrontation with experimental measurements is necessary , as it spurs further improvements of such phenomenological approaches .",
    "the lower part of the figure [ fig : maire - fig1-correctedspectra ] shows the ratio between data and mc predictions .",
    "the data are here compared to the tune perugia 2011 ( tune s350 @xcite ) of the pythia model @xcite .",
    "although this specific tune provides an improved description of data with respect to earlier tunes ( tunes z2 and perugia 0 ) @xcite , it can still be seen that mc underestimates the measured spectra , up to a factor @xmath34 2 for the charged , @xmath34 5 for the",
    ". however it should be noted for ( ) that there is an agreement between mc and data at @xmath7 @xmath35 6 , where the fragmentation regime may already be reached .",

    "it computes the ratio of ( ) to ( ) as a function of @xmath7 . as before ,",
    "it can be noted the model tends to underpredict the particle ratio , by a factor @xmath342 . regarding the data ratio itself",
    ", it turns out the ratio first rises with @xmath7 , before seemingly saturating at a value of 0.15 , which could suggest that the hierarchy between and production becomes constant at high @xmath7 .     between ( + ) and ( + ) as a function of transverse momentum , for collisions at @xmath0 = 7 .",
    "the ratio is given for alice data as well as pythia perugia 2011 ( p2011 ) .",

    "these values are compared to the isr parametrisation ( performed from the @xmath37 , k , p species in collisions at ) and star measurements in central @xmath38 collisions at @xcite . ]      the figure [ fig : maire - fig3-alicemeanpt - ppcollisions ] presents the alice preliminary values obtained for the mean @xmath7 ( @xmath36 ) of various identified particles , as measured in collisions at 7 . for comparison , the data are plotted together with results published by alice for data at @xmath0 = 0.9 @xcite as well as by star for the central @xmath38 collisions at @xmath39 = 0.2 @xcite . for a given particle studied in collisions",
