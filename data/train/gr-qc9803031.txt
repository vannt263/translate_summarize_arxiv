    "the detection of gravitational waves by kilometric - size laser - interferometer systems such as ligo in the us and virgo in europe will initiate a new era in astronomy .",
    "one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves is the inspiralling compact binary , a binary system made of neutron stars or black holes whose orbit decays under gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "the observation of these systems will provide important astrophysical information , e.g. masses of neutron stars , and direct distance measurements up to hundreds of mpc @xcite .",
    "it is also said that detecting gravitational waves from inspiralling binaries should provide rich tests of the law of relativistic gravity in situations comprising strong - field regions ( like near a neutron star or a black hole ) . however , present binary - pulsar experiments already provide us with deep and accurate tests of strong - field gravity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare and contrast the probing power of present ( and foreseeable ) pulsar tests with that of future gravity - wave observations .",
    "a convenient quantitative way of doing this comparison is to work within a multi - parameter family of physically motivated ( and physically consistent ) theories of gravity which differ from einstein s theory in their radiative and strong - field predictions .",
    "the most natural framework of this type is the general class of tensor - scalar theories in which gravity is mediated both by a tensor field @xmath0 ( `` einstein metric '' ) and by a scalar field @xmath1 .",

    "we wish , however , to emphasize that this seemingly pessimistic conclusion is mainly due to having restricted one s attention to the special , one - parameter jordan - fierz - brans - dicke theory .",
    "indeed , in this theory the strength of the coupling of the scalar field @xmath1 to matter is given by the constant quantity @xmath5 independently of the state of condensation of the gravitational source .",
    "as a consequence , the predictions of the theory differ from those of einstein s theory by a fraction of order @xmath9 in all situations : weak - field ones or strong - field ones , alike .",
