    "the traditional investigation of stability of shear flows is cast as a linear initial - value perturbation problem . in principle , save for the additional complexity of necessitating three space dimensions as well as time , this is done by means of a laplace transform in time . once the boundary conditions have been satisfied , the stability or non stability is found .",
    "further , depending upon the mean shear flow that is being investigated , the causes are determined .",
    "no attention is given to any specific input or the effect of various physics . moreover ,",
    "little attention was given to early period dynamics , see for example grosch and salwen @xcite , salwen and grosch @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that there can be early time growth of a perturbation even if there is damping for long time .",
    "in short , a branch cut can be present as well as any pole when inverting the laplace transform .",
    "next , from the laboratory , interest turned to spatial growth or decay after an input at an initial location rather than the temporal behavior .",
    "this construction creates new difficulties but they are not insurmountable @xcite , @xcite .",
    "still , just as in the temporal problem , no specific initial input has been examined .",
    "regardless of the framework , it has been known since the first results of stability theory , that the value of the wavenumber that comes into the analytical framework ( due to fourier decomposition in the variables in the plane that is perpendicular to the mean flow ) is small in the regions where there is instability . in short , long waves .",
    "such a result provides a sound means for the analysis and examination of a specific initial input .",
    "this is true whether posed as a temporal or spatial initial - value problem .",
    "it further provides a means to investigate interaction , the early period and a way to suppress any growth at the early period or location . in 1962",
    "a study about the instability to long waves of unbounded parallel inviscid flow was given by drazin and howard @xcite .",
    "using the normal mode analysis , they found that there is a finite number of different modes unstable to long waves , essentially one for each relative maximum or minimum of the velocity profile .",
    "healey @xcite considered long waves for investigating spatial instability of the rotating - disc boundary layer , and by means of an analytic theory in the inviscid long wave limit , he obtained an explicit expression for the growth rate in terms of basic flow parameters .",
    "large or long waves have now been used in full nonlinear simulations .",
    "for example , ryzkov and shevtsova @xcite focused on convective instability in multicomponent fluids , showing by means of both linear stability analysis and nonlinear numerical calculations that the instability is caused by the interplay between the basic flow and the concentration waves which have a long scale in a vertical direction . and barros and choi @xcite considered the inhibition of the shear instability that can be induced by large amplitude internal solitary waves travelling in a two - layer flow with a top free surface . for large eddy simulations in turbulence see @xcite or @xcite among many others .",
    "the analysis in the present work is based on large scale waves and expansions using multi scales and multi times for the partial differential equations .",
    "the multiscale is based on an approach where the small parameter is linked to the perturbation property independently from the flow control parameter .",
    "in fact , the perturbation scheme is based on the introduction of a small parameter which is the wavenumber @xmath0 in the limit @xmath1 , and is analytically determined to the second order .",
    "the perturbative equations used follow the formulation given by criminale and drazin @xcite that describes the system in terms of perturbation vorticity and velocity .",
    "numerically , the complete linear system has also been integrated for the non parallel base flow . what results is an extension of a previous work based on a locally near parallel assumption @xcite",
    "the formulation of the linear perturbation initial - value problem is presented in section 2 .",

    "as expected , for smaller values of the polar wavenumber the agreement between multiscale @xmath91 and full problem is improving ( the multiscale @xmath91 solution practically coincides with that of the full problem for @xmath173 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note in the interval between zero and forty base flow time scales , the presence of a temporal oscillation characterized by a period of about 10 time scales .",
    "the transient thus presents a further time scale beyond its proper global one which , in this case , is lasting 100 units .",
    "the limit for a zero spatial decay , i.e. @xmath174 , was considered in different situations , see fig .",

    "[ dt_multiscale_gr4 ] , the thick curves represent the full problem solution with @xmath79 , while the thin curves are the multiscale @xmath91 results with @xmath74 values going to zero .",
    "the right limit of the multiscale @xmath91 solution for @xmath174 is finite , and is closely reaching the full problem solution .",
    "as can be observed , the curves with smaller spatial decay rates are approaching the thick curve from above .",
    "this behavior holds in the early transient and in the asymptotic state .",
    "it should be noted that , in this particular case ( @xmath144 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , asymmetric initial condition , @xmath161 ) , the complete problem at @xmath175 has a temporal growth rate close to zero , and thus is in a near state of marginal stability .",
    "but , as previously remarked ( cf .",
    "section ii ) , this is not a general behavior for the complete problem .",
    "however , it is true that the limiting behaviors for @xmath176 of the multiscaling and of the complete problem are very close . and , as the case shown in fig.6 confirms that , if a difference exists , this will be located just at @xmath175",
    "this means that the right limit of the multiscaling for @xmath79 correctly approximates the complete problem , but this limit value it is not always equal to the value at @xmath79 ( where the multiscaling yields marginal stability , i.e. @xmath177 ) .",
    "it can be concluded that , in any case , the true limit of the complete problem can be obtained by extrapolating the multiscaling results .",
    "it is noted that , in fig .",
    "[ dt_multiscale_gr4 ] , for asymmetric and transversal initial conditions with a non vanishing spatial decay , a discontinuity in the temporal growth rate can again be observed at @xmath178 , see also fig.3 .",
    "the comparison between the long waves temporal asymptotics of the full problem and its multiscaling version is shown in fig .",
    "[ ivp_comparison_nmt_ivp_kfixed ] . to consider a situation where the multiscaling applies the polar wavenumber @xmath0",
    "is fixed to the value @xmath179 , while the decay in space @xmath74 of the longitudinal wave is in the range @xmath180 $ ] .",
    "multiscale to @xmath91 results ( squares and dots ) are in excellent agreement , for symmetric and asymmetric initial inputs , with full problem data ( circles and triangles ) .",
    "note that the agrement improves for increasing values of @xmath74 .",
    "a minimum of the perturbation energy ( in terms of @xmath136 ) is found around @xmath181 and a similar behavior is shown by the angular frequency @xmath139 .",
    "different transient configurations have been observed by changing the spatial damping rate , the symmetry of the perturbation and its polar wavenumber ( the magnitude , in order to check the method accuracy , and the angle of obliquity ) .",
    "since the results relevant to the complete problem are in very good agreement with the results of the first order analysis , in the present work attention was focused on the resolution of the multiscaling at order @xmath91 only .",
    "two main results can be noted .",
    "first , the perturbation symmetry influences the transient .",
    "in particular , asymmetric transversal perturbations show a different kind of transient which includes an initial decay ( first few time scales ) and then a growth that abruptly changes its time derivative after about @xmath23 time scales .",
    "a sequence of such a kind of discontinuities can be envisaged up to where the growth rate of the corresponding symmetric perturbation is met .",
    "second , the spatial decay substantially affects the transient . for example , in the case of asymmetric perturbations , it is observed that high spatial damping makes the initial temporal decay interval shorter and , at the same time , greatly increases the temporal growth rate .",
    "multiscale data have been compared with full problem results in the asymptotic temporal limit .",
    "as far as small wavenumbers are concerned , the agreement is very good for both symmetric and asymmetric initial conditions as arbitrarily expressed in terms of elements of the trigonometrical schauder basis for the @xmath86 space .",
    "lastly , it is noted that the amplification factor of transversal perturbations never presents the trend  a growth followed by a long damping - usually observed in waves with wavenumber of order one or less .",
    "asymptotically unstable configurations in time have always been observed here in the limit of long waves .",
    "here we detail the coefficients , @xmath40 and @xmath42 , of the asymptotic expansion representing the intermediate and far base flow .",
