    "the key reason preventing a correct inclusion of the einstein theory of gravitation in the interactions unification is that gravity is identified with space - time curvature .",
    "it is also a cause of such unsolved problems of the theory as an operational definition of the observable variables , the energy - momentum tensor problem and gravity quantization . in the present paper starting from @xcite ,",
    "@xcite we consider a likely reason of gravity geometrization .",
    "we argue that the gravitation properties are not absolute with respect to the used frame of reference . in inertial frames of reference gravitation",
    "can be considered as a field in flat space - time , while in so called proper frames of reference it manifests itself as space - time curvature .",
    "the author s gravitation equations which realize this idea are considered in details .",
    "they do not contradict available experimental data .",
    "the physical consequences resulting from the equations differ very little from the ones in general relativity if the distances from the attracting mass are much larger than the schwarzschild radius @xmath0 . however , they are completely different at the distances equal to @xmath0 or less than that .",
    "a number of new physical consequences follow from the equations .",
    "the geometrical properties of space - time can be described only by means of measuring instruments . at the same time",
    ", the description of the properties of measuring instruments , strictly speaking , requires knowledge of space - time geometry .",
    "one of the implications of it is that geometrical properties of space and time have no experimentally verifiable significance by themselves but only within the aggregate ",
    "geometry + measuring instruments  .",
    "we got aware of it owing to poincar @xcite .",
    "it is a development of the idea by berkley - leibnitz - mach about relativity of space - time properties which is an alternative to the well known newtonian approach .",
    "if we proceed from the conception of relativity of space - time , we assume that there is no way of quantitative description of physical phenomena other than attributing them to a certain frame of reference which in itself is a physical device for space and time measurements .",
    "but then the relativity of the geometrical properties of space and time mentioned above is nothing else but relativity of space - time geometry with respect to the frame of reference being used ..    thus , it should be assumed that the concept of the reference frame as a physical object , whose properties are given and are independent of the properties of space and time , is approximate , and only the aggregate  frame of reference + space - time geometry  has a sense .",
    "the einstein theory of gravitation demonstrates relativity of space - time with respect to distribution of matter . however , space - time relativity with respect to measurement instruments hitherto has not been realized in physical theory .",
    "an attempt to show that there is also space - time relativity to the used reference frames for the first time has been undertaken in @xcite , @xcite .    at present",
    "we do not know how the space - time geometry in inertial frames of reference ( ifrs ) is connected with the frames properties . under the circumstances , we simply postulate ( according to special relativity ) that space - time in ifrs is pseudo - euclidean .",
    "next , we find a space - time metric differential form in noninertial frames of reference ( nifrs ) from the viewpoint of an observer in the nifr who proceeds from the relativity of space and time in the berkley - leibnitz - mach - poincar ( blmp ) sense . it is shown that there are reasons to believe that side by side with generally accepted viewpoint on motion in noninertial frames of reference as a relative motion there can also be another point of view . according to this viewpoint the metric differential form @xmath1 in the nifr",
    "is completely conditioned by the properties of the frame being used as is to be expected according to the idea of relativity of space and time in the blmp sense .",
    "by a noninertial frame of reference we mean the frame , whose body of reference is fo/-rm/-ed by the point masses moving in the ifr under the effect of a given force field .    it would be a mistake to identify `` a priori '' a transition from the ifr to the nifr with the transformation of coordinates related to the frames .",
    "if we act in such a way , we already assume that the properties of the space - time in both frames are identical . however , for an observer in the nifr , who proceeds from the relativity of space and time in the blmp sense , space - time geometry is not given `` a priori '' and must be ascertained from the analysis of experimental data .",
    "we shall suppose that the reference body ( rb ) of the ifr or nifr is formed by the identical point masses @xmath2 .",
    "if the observer is at rest in one of the frames , his world line will coincide with the world line of some point of the reference body .",
    "it is obvious to the observer in the ifr that the accelerations of the point masses forming the reference body are equal to zero .",
    "of course , this fact occurs in relativistic sense too .",
    "that is , if the differential metric form of space - time in the ifr is denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the 4- velocity vector of the point masses forming the reference body , then the absolute derivative of the vector @xmath5 is equal to zero , i.e .",
    "@xmath6 ( we mean that an arbitrary coordinate system is used )",
    ".    does this fact occur for an observer in the nifr ?",
    "that is , if the differential metric form of space - time in the nifr is denoted by @xmath1 , does the 4-velocity vector @xmath7 of the point masses forming the reference body of this nifr obey the equation @xmath8    ?",
    "the answer depends on whether space and time are absolute in newtonian sense or they are relative in the blmp sense .",
    "if space and time are absolute , the point masses of the nifr reference body for an observer in this nifr are at relative rest . a notion of relative acceleration can be determined in a covariant way @xcite .",
    "this value is equal to zero .",
    "however , eqs.([vr_3/2 ] ) , strictly speaking , are not satisfied .",
    "if space and time are relative in the blmp sense , then for observers in the ifr and nifr the motion of the point masses forming the reference body , which are kinematically equivalent , must be dynamically equivalent too ( both in the nonrelativistic and relativistic sense ) .",
    "that is , if from the viewpoint of the observer in the ifr , the point masses forming the nifr rb are at rest ( are not subject to the influence of forces ) , then from the viewpoint of the observer in the nifr the point masses forming the rb of his frame are at rest too ( are not subject to the influence of forces either ) . in other words , if for the observer in the ifr the world lines of the ifr rb points are , according to eq .",
    "( [ vr_3/1 ] ) , the geodesic lines , then for the observer in the nifr the world lines of the nifr rb points are also the geodesic lines in his space - time , which can be expressed by eq .",
    "( [ vr_3/2 ] ) .",
    "the differential equations of these world lines at the same time are the lagrange equations of motion of the nifr rb points .",
    "the lagrange equations , describing the motion of the identical rb point masses in the ifr , can be obtained from the lagrange action @xmath9 by the principle of least action .",
    "therefore , the equations of the geodesic lines can be obtained from the differential metric form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the constant , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the lagrange function .",
    "the constant @xmath14 , as it follows from the analysis of the case when the frame of reference is inertial .",
    "it is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "thus , if we proceed from relativity of space and time in the blmp sense , then the differential metric form of space - time in the nifr can be expected to have the following form @xmath16 in this equation @xmath9 is the lagrangian action describing ( in an ifr ) the motion of the identical point masses @xmath2 , forming the nifr reference body .",
    "so , the properties of space - time in the nifr are entirely determined by the properties of the used frame in accordance with the idea of relativity of space and time in the blmp sense .",
    "consider two examples of the nifr .",
    "1.the reference body is formed by noninteracting electric charges moving in a constant homogeneous electric field @xmath17 .",
    "the motion of the charges is described in cartesian coordinates by the lagrangian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the speed of the charges .    according to eq .",

    "@xmath38 is a homogeneous function of the first degree in @xmath39 .",

    "the phase shift in the interference of two coherent light beams on a rotating frame was observed by sagnac @xcite . for a relativistic explanation of the effect",

    "it must have some  internal  physical explanation .",
    "a rigid disk rotating in the plane @xmath29 with angular velocity @xmath91 around the axis @xmath24 is approximately identical to the nifr described in example 2 of sec.3 .",
