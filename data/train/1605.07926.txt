    "despite decades of intensive research  @xcite , the mechanics leading to strain localization in soils are not well identified . for geo - mechanicians ,",
    "strain localization is the result of mechanical instabilities  @xcite .",
    "when the stress exceeds a threshold ( i.e. given by mohr - coulomb criterium for the stress component ratio ) , the material fails . before such failure , soils flow plastically  @xcite , but the link between this plastic flow and failure is quite unclear  @xcite .",
    "recent approaches to describe the rheology of granular materials propose non - local constitutive relations inspired by models coming from soft glassy materials  @xcite and introducing a new variable to describe the local state of the material ( the fluidity ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of this fluidity is still unclear and debated  @xcite    metallic glasses are another example of materials where plastic flow occurs before strain localization .",
    "it has been suggested that for these amorphous materials  @xcite , the macroscopic plasticity is the result of numerous elementary plastic events .",
    "an elementary event may be viewed as a small and local reorganization at the molecular scale .",
    "such events have been found in numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "this description in term of elementary plastic events seems also relevant for soft glassy materials ( such as dense emulsions or foams ) or compressed granular materials  @xcite .",
    "such elementary events have been indeed reported in some experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "a very important consequence of those elementary plastic events is that they are able to interact mechanically . indeed , when they occur , they redistribute stress in the material  @xcite . for an elastic material ,",
    "this redistribution is long - ranged and anisotropic , so that it may trigger other rearrangements further in the material along preferential directions .",
    "this coupling between plastic events is believed to be at the origin of formation of spatial heterogeneities  @xcite ( such as shear band ) at the macroscopic scale .",
    "consequently a good understanding of the stress redistribution around a single event is needed .",
    "it is a subject that has been already deeply studied , especially numerically  @xcite , while experimental proofs of this redistribution are scarce  @xcite .",
    "those studies show that the stress redistribution around a local event may be well described using a computation done by eshelby  @xcite where an inclusion embedded in an elastic matrix spontaneously changes shape .",
    "the analytical solutions obtained from such a calculation provide a good description of the stress field measured numerically around plastic events , i.e. a quadrupolar stress redistribution . using this theoretical representation of plastic events as eshelby inclusions and considering the coupling between several events , predictions of the yield strain",
    "can be obtained  @xcite , as well as of the inclination of shear bands  @xcite .",
    "active rearrangements have also been studied numerically in order to investigate the dynamics of the response of the material to a local rearrangement  @xcite as well as the correlation between this elastic response and the subsequent plastic events  @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that most of the numerical studies discussed above have been done in lennard - jones glasses for which a domain of truly elastic response exists .",
    "so , an elastic response of the matrix surrounding a small plastic event is not a surprise . for materials which do not behave as perfectly elastically ,",
    "the pertinency of eshelby s calculation can be questioned .",
    "wu  _ et al .",
    "_ show that the stress relaxation in liquid at times shorter than the maxwell relaxation time may be described accordingly to eshelby s stress tensors  @xcite .",
    "the fourfold pattern characteristic of eshelby s stress tensors has observed in recent numerical studies of granular flows at constant volume  @xcite .",
    "also , fluctuations of strains are observed experimentally  @xcite with inclinations related to the maximum of the deviatoric part of eshelby s stress tensors .",
    "similar oriented patterns were observed in numerical studies of compressed granular material  @xcite , although the author does not link them to the eshelby s tensors .",
    "the aim of this study is to show that the stress redistribution due to a local reorganization in a granular material may be unambiguously described using the eshelby formalism . for this , we focus on a realistic situation , where the granular material evolves at fixed pressure , allowing compaction or dilatation .",
    "we implement in a discrete element numerical model of a bidimensional frictional granular assembly an active inclusion with a new procedure very close to the spirit of the demonstration of eshelby .",
    "we show that the observed response of the granular assembly corresponds to the one expected for an elastic material  @xcite .",
    "we study specifically the role of two parameters on the response of the system : the value of the friction coefficient , which governs the prevalency of sliding contacts in the system , and the loading state of the sample , i.e. its proximity to failure .",
    "this study is organized in the following way :    in section  [ sec : prep ] we explain the mode of loading of the material , which consists in a biaxial test , and we describe the preparation of the numerical experiments .",
    "we also describe the typical response obtained during the loading of the material . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we give an overview of the principle of the calculation of eshelby and we discuss our method of generating an eshelby - type inclusion in our simulations . in section  [ sec : results ] , we describe the stress field observed around an active inclusion at different stages of the loading and for different values of the friction coefficient . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we measure the angular distribution of the anisotropic response and we present the results of the evolution of the inclination of the maximum of the stress distribution as a function of the volumetric strain .",
    "we discuss the modification of the response of the system when the amount of plasticity in the granular matrix increases , either because of decreasing friction or because the system is closer to failure .",
    "in this section , we present the discrete element numerical simulations and explain the method of preparation of the samples .",
    "we consider a bidimensional sample submitted to a biaxial test .",
    "this classical configuration  @xcite consists in submitting a granular sample to well - controlled stress conditions without control of the volume .",
    "experimentally , a uniaxial compression is exerted along one direction while a confining pressure is imposed on the lateral side of the granular sample .",
    "those kind of tests are classically used in soil mechanics to study the strain - stress properties of granular materials  @xcite . for large enough initial volume fraction , localization of the deformation",
    "is observed above a threshold  @xcite , with the formation of shear bands .",
    "concerning the volumetric strain , still for initial volume fraction larger than a critical value , some compaction is observed at the beginning of the loading , followed by dilatancy at larger strain .",
    "those kinds of test are unusual for physicists who prefer to work at constant volume and uncontrolled pressure , in order to study the behavior of a sample at a given volume fraction  @xcite . yet , confining pressure controlled set - ups are the most natural configurations when trying to understand real life granular mechanical behavior . because we are interested in this kind of configuration",
    ", we will give special care to local change of volume in the following .",
    "as a matter of fact dilatancy and plastic deformation are closely linked in granular materials .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] and  [ sec : procedure ] , we discuss the numerical setup and test procedure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tests ] we describe general properties of our biaxial tests .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of a two - dimensional biaxial test .",
    "the boundary conditions are sketched in fig .",

    "@xmath0 grains of total mass @xmath1 are confined by four perpendicular walls .",
    "the left and bottom walls are fixed and motionless .",
    "the top wall moves downward with a constant velocity .",
    "these three walls can be considered to be of infinite mass , for their positions are not modified by the forces exerted by the grains . the right wall , however , is mobile , with a mass of @xmath2 .",
    "it is kept in place by a constant pressure @xmath3 .",
    "grains are contained within four walls : the bottom and left walls are fixed , the upper wall moves downward with constant velocity .",
    "the right wall is mobile , and subjected to a constant pressure @xmath3 . throughout the paper , the coordinate axes @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 are oriented as shown . ]",
    "the grains are polydisperse disks ( @xmath6 ) of uniform ( two - dimensional ) mass density @xmath7 .",
    "the quantities @xmath1 , @xmath7 , and @xmath3 establish the system of units .",
    "thus length is measured in units of @xmath8 , time in units of @xmath9 , and velocity in units of @xmath10 .",
    "the grains interact via traditional linear , damped springs in the normal and tangential directions ( normal spring constant @xmath11 , tangential spring constant @xmath12 ) .",
    "weak linear damping is also included in these interactions .",
    "the grains also have a ( microscopic ) friction ratio @xmath13 : the tangential force may not exceed @xmath13 times the normal force .",
    "a weak rolling resistance is added so that all vibration modes will be damped .",
    "finally , a weak gravitational force is added to gently push `` rattlers '' against the granular skeleton .",
    "all four walls are frictionless , exerting only normal forces .",
    "the mobile wall has the same stiffness as the grains , but the three walls of infinite mass are soft ( spring constant @xmath14 ) and dissipative .",
    "this novel boundary conditions efficiently removes vibrational energy from the system without resorting to global damping @xcite .",
    "the simulations presented below are done with @xmath15 grains .",
    "the initial state is formed by compressing a granular gas without friction ( i.e. we set @xmath16 ) , yielding a relatively high density .",
    "then , at the beginning of the test , friction is turned on ( i.e. we set @xmath13 to its final value ) , and the velocity of the top wall is set to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the initial height of the system .",
    "we checked that decreasing further the velocity do not change the results of the simulation .",
    "as the simulation proceeds , the entire state of the system ( particle positions and velocities , contact forces ) are recorded at strain increments of @xmath19 , where the deformation @xmath20 is defined in [ sec : tests ]          in fig .",
    "[ fig : stress - strain ] , we show the stress - strain curve for the simulations studied in this paper .",
    "the stress is deduced from the force exerted by the grains on the upper ( constant velocity ) wall .",
    "the strain is usually deduced in simulations from the position of this wall , but that does not work in this situation due to the softness of the wall .",
    "indeed , more than half of the apparent deformation can occur at the wall , and not within the packing .",
    "instead , we return to the definition of strain : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the @xmath5-component of the displacement of a material point relative to a reference state .",
    "we therefore calculate the displacement of each grain , and accumulate @xmath0 pairs @xmath23 , and then do a linear regression and take the slope of as @xmath24 , the deformation from the reference state . at the beginning of the simulation",
    ", the initial condition is the reference state , but each time the deformation increases by @xmath25 , the reference state is updated .",
    "the total deformation , averaged over the full sample , is @xmath20 in fig .",

    ", we obtain results similar to those obtained experimentally or in other numerical experiments . when @xmath28 , the peak stress exceeds @xmath29 times the confining pressure .",
    "this quite high value do not correspond to experimental values of grain - grain friction coefficients .",
    "however , it is an interesting limit case for theoretical reasons .     for the tests studied in this paper .",

    "( the strain component @xmath31 is determined in the same way as @xmath20 strain component . )",
    "this result is in agreement with the experimental observations in biaxial and triaxial tests : the loading curve presents a maximum and the volumetric strain first decreases before continuously increasing .",
    "in this part we present our method for implementing an active inclusion in a granular material .",
    "active inclusions in numerical simulation have been considered recently  @xcite in two - dimensional lennard - jones glasses by imposing displacements on the particles forming the inclusion .",
    "this approach amounts to imposing a strain on the inclusion .",
    "here we propose a new procedure to implement an active inclusion where a stress is imposed .",
    "we do this for two reasons .",
    "first of all , we are dealing with granular materials , where changes of volume are very important .",
    "thus we want to leave the inclusion free to choose the volume it wants .",
    "second , the stress we impose appears at the beginning of the eshelby s calculation  @xcite .",
    "we will explain this more precisely below .",
    "eshelby gave a general method based on the linear superposition of small deformation elasticity to solve a class of problems implicating an inclusion in an elastic matrix .",
    "he also gives analytical solutions of several typical problems . in the following",
    ", we will use the solution of this problem : consider a small part of an infinite elastic matrix which we will call the inclusion . suppose that this inclusion has a spontaneous change of shape .",
    "the eshelby solution of interest for us gives the stress field distribution in the matrix due to that local event when the unconstrained spontaneous change of shape of the inclusion is known .",
    "the coordinate system used in the following is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . for the vector positions , we use the polar coodinates @xmath32 .",
    "the origin is taken at the center of the inclusion .",
    "in all the considered cases , the imposed stress at the boundaries corresponds to biaxial stress - imposed configuration : @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "+ in this theoretical section , we first recall the general principle of eshelby s calculation . in the second part",
    ", we give the general form of the analytical solution far from the inclusion . in the last part our method of generating eshelby - type inclusion in the numerical simulation is described .",
    "consider an inclusion , within an infinite elastic matrix , which undergoes a spontaneous change of shape .",
    "if it had not been inside a matrix , this change of shape would correspond to the homogeneous strain tensor @xmath36 .",
    "the elastic stress field associated to this strain tensor is @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the lam coefficients  @xcite .",
    "as the inclusion is in a matrix , its change of shape will interact with the elastic surrounding medium , leading to a displacement field @xmath40 in the matrix , generated by the rearrangement and given in 2d by : @xmath41 where the integral covers the inclusion contour @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the bidimensional green function giving the displacement response awaited at @xmath44 from a ponctual unitary force exerted in @xmath45 belonging to the contour on an element @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the following part discusses the far - field redistributed deviatoric stress for @xmath36 coaxial with the loading @xmath47 .",
    "complete solutions ( with near - field terms ) of the previous equations in the case of an elliptical inclusion can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the displacement field in the matrix far from the inclusion can be approximated by ( see appendix  [ sec : ap_2d ] ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the area of the inclusion .",
    "the function @xmath50 depends only on the direction @xmath51 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dep2d_a2 ] ) .",
    "the explicit determination of the solution depends on the expression of @xmath52 . in the present study ,",
    "we restrict to the case of strain tensors characterizing the plastic rearrangement coaxial to the uniform imposed stress tensor @xmath53 , i.e. : @xmath54 the geometry of the loading motivates this hypothesis .",
    "furthermore , dasgupta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that this orientation minimizes the energy of interaction between the external strain field and the inclusion at high enough strain .",
    "the components of the strain tensor @xmath55 induced by the rearrangement in the surrounding matrix can then be computed explicitly ( see appendix  [ sec : ap_2d ] ) .    in a biaxial experiment , the crucial quantity which characterizes the shear and which governs the response of the material is the deviatoric stress @xmath56 .",
    "the significant component of the stress redistribution to determine is thus the redistributed deviatoric stress @xmath57 , which will add to the imposed stress field and will thus modify locally the total deviatoric stress . here",

    "( [ eq : ugreen2d ] ) , shows that the stress redistribution due to the inclusion is obtained by integrating green function for stress over the boundary of the inclusion . in the simulations , therefore , we will define a small inclusion , and then modify the stress at the boundary .",
    "but since the simulation is discrete , we must apply this stress in a discrete way .",
    "we specify a perturbing stress @xmath69 , and not a perturbing strain @xmath70 because in eshelby s calculation , it is the stress that is propagated into the material [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ugreen2d ] ) ] .",
    "the perturbing stress is obtained from the perturbing strain , using the elastic coefficients . in our case , the elastic coefficients are not known , so that a more direct comparison can be obtained by directly imposing a stress .",

    "( [ eq : love - grains ] ) thus vanishes , leaving only those contacts that cross the boundary : @xmath100 this equation tells us that the stress inside a region is determined just by the contacts that span the boundary .    up to now ,",
    "we have been considering these equations from a diagnostic point of view , that is , the contact forces and grain positions are extracted from numerical data , and then the stress tensor is calculated in view of passing over to a continuum description .",
    "now we will take a different perspective : the stress tensor on the left hand side is a perturbing stress that we want to apply inside @xmath71 , while the forces on the right hand side are modifications of the contact forces that we will introduce in order to apply that stress .",

    "we first perform a compression of the granular material as described in  [ sec : setup ] up to a given deformation .",

    "futhermore , the response is proportional to the perturbing stress , so we divide by @xmath149 yielding a function @xmath62 of order unity .",
    "we want to identify the position of the maxima of @xmath62 .",
    "to this end , we consider the grains with @xmath150 , and sort them into classes according to their angle @xmath141 , and calculate the average change in stress in each class to obtain an estimate of @xmath62 .",

    "the maxima of this fourier series are identified as the angle of the diagonal bands of the eshelby .",

    "[ fig : eshelby - angles ] , we show the angle found in this way for the three biaxial tests of figs .",
    "[ fig : stress - strain ] and  [ fig : volume - strain ] . for each strain value , there are four angles , one for each of the diagonal bands giving its angle relative to the horizontal .",
    "these angles are averaged together to obtain a point on the graph .",
    "the error bars estimate the scatter of the points ; they show the uncertainty of the mean .",
    "we observe that at the beginning of the loading all the angles are close to @xmath137 but with some fluctuations around this value .",
    "when the loading increase , the departure from @xmath137 becomes important .",
    "we will further discuss this figure in the next section .    to conclude , the mental construction of eshelby underlying his computation can be implemented in a numerical simulation of dry frictional disks . in spite of the discrete nature of the material ,",
    "the continuum mechanics solutions are clearly relevant as the observed response is very similar to the one predicted analytically .",
    "this picture is modified when the granular material if further loaded and the friction coefficient decreased .",
    "in this part we discuss the departure from the quadrupolar response observed in figure  [ fig : eshelby - example ] either due to the value of the friction coefficient or to the loading of the material .",
    "as shown in the previous part , for an isotropically slightly pre - compressed granular material ( initial preparation ) , the response of the material to a localized shear event is compatible with an elastic response ( first column of fig .",
    "[ fig : eshelby - example ] ) .",
    "this picture is modified in two different ways when the material is submitted to an increasing deviatoric stress depending on the value of the friction coefficient .",
    "we discuss the different kind of departures from this ideal response in the following .",
    "as can be seen on the first column of figure  [ fig : eshelby - example ] , at the very beginning of the loading the response is very close to the theoretical prediction recalled in section  [ subsec:2d ] and in figure  [ fig : polaire2d ] .",
    "quantitatively , as discussed in the preceding section , the radial response is in @xmath144 and the angular response is dominated by a quadrupolar dependence ( figure  [ fig : eshelby - r ] ) , with a maximum stress redistribution close to @xmath137 .",
    "the direct observation of the stress fields shown in figure  [ fig : eshelby - example ] shows nevertheless some differences with the response of a continuous material : we can observe that a filamentary pattern underly the smooth response .",
    "consequently , the observed stress redistribution is also compatible with a description of the granular material in term of force chains .",
    "the observed striations could indeed indicate that stress is concentrated on grains in force chains . nevertheless , on a large scale , a smooth quadrupolar response is observed .    as the loading increases , two different behaviors are observed . for @xmath28 ( top row ) ,",
    "the texture of the patterns remains the same , but the angles depart significantly from @xmath137 . for @xmath27 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the angles remain close to @xmath137 , but the texture changes significantly .",
    "we now discuss these changes .",
    "when the friction coefficient is artificially high to prevent sliding contacts ( upper line of figure  [ fig : eshelby - example ] ) , we observe a clear modification of the angles characterizing the stress resdistribution .",
    "meanwhile , the increase in the fluctuations is much smaller than for the smaller friction coefficients .",
    "a change of inclination can still be interpreted in an eshelby picture and we will discuss two possible origins in the following : the effect of the volumetric strain and the effect of anisotropical elasticity .      as discussed in section  [ subsec:2d ] , the quadrupolar response due to the shear part of the rearrangement",
    "is modified by the volumetric contribution . to make explicit this dependence , we study the polar function @xmath62 of eq .",
    "[ eq : f_2d ] .",
    "the minima of the function are obtained for @xmath153 $ ] and the maxima for @xmath154 for the isovolumic case ( @xmath155 ) , we obtain @xmath156 $ ] .",
    "our active inclusions correspond to an imposed traceless stress tensor @xmath157 .",
    "if the inclusion is made of an isotropic elastic material , the associated strain tensor will also be traceless .",
    "but the loading process introduces anisotropy into the contact network and thus into the elastic constants , as will be discussed in the next section . in such cases ,",
    "@xmath158 may be non - zero .",
    "if we suppose that the inclusion changes its volume , a reasonable hypothesis is that @xmath159 and @xmath160 , i.e. that the local deformation follows the overall macroscopic deformation .",
    "we then obtain for the range of possible values @xmath161 $ ] , i.e. @xmath162 $ ] .",
    "the values greater than @xmath67 correspond to @xmath163 , i.e. to dilating plastic events , while the values lesser than @xmath67 correspond to contracting plastic events . those two cases are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : polaire2d ] : the angle of the positive part of the deviatoric stress redistribution is indeed smaller than @xmath67 in the case of a contracting event ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polaire2d](a ) ) and larger in the case of a dilating one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polaire2d](b ) ) .",
    "the range of possible angles found here correspond to the direction of the maximum of the redistributed deviatoric stress from a single eshelby inclusion .",
    "it differs from the range obtained in  @xcite , where the range of directions of coupled eshelby inclusion is determined by minimizing the elastic energy of interaction between the inclusions .",
    "the result of this calculation is that only small departure from @xmath67 can be explained by non - isovolumic transformation .",
    "it could for example explain the fluctuations measured in figure  [ fig : eshelby - angles ] for @xmath164 and @xmath165 but not the large increase observed in the @xmath166 case .      .",

    "( a ) @xmath166 , ( b ) @xmath165 and ( c ) @xmath167.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this part , we will neglect possible change of volume of the inclusion ( @xmath168 ) but we will consider the eshelby problem in the case of anisotropic elasticity .",
    "indeed , the loading process may induce some anisotropy of the elasticity of the material  @xcite .",
    "the computation of the green s function in an anisotropic material is done in appendix  [ sec : ap_aniso ] .",
    "equation  [ eq : aniso ] shows that in the case of an orthorhombic bidimensional material with a small anisotropy , terms in @xmath169 and @xmath170 appear . on the contrary , change of volume of the inclusion do not generate @xmath170 terms .",
    "so the presence of @xmath170 terms in @xmath62 may be viewed as an indication of anisotropic elasticity .",
    "this can be checked by the fourier analysis done in section  [ subsec : angles ] ( fit of the measured response by equation  [ eq : fit ] ) . the different components of the fit are shown in figure  [ fig : harmonic ] . we observe that indeed the @xmath170 component is the second most important harmonic in the case of @xmath28 .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that the observed modification of the angle is due to the effect of material anisotropy , and not to volume change of the inclusion .",
    "this effect is less clear for @xmath165 and @xmath164 where the second dominant harmonic is @xmath169 which can originate both from volumetric effects and anisotropical effects .",
    "in fact , for those values of @xmath13 , the principal effect of the loading is not modification of the angles ( that fluctuate close to @xmath67 - see figure  [ fig : eshelby - angles ] ) but rather the increase of fluctuations ( see figure  [ fig : eshelby - example ] ) as will be discussed in the next part .      for @xmath165 and @xmath164 at intermediate and large values of the strain ( lower right four panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : eshelby - example ] ) the filamentary striations visible in the other panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : eshelby - example ] ) are replaced by a grainy strongly fluctuating texture . in spite of this , the response at large scales remains quadrupolar , with angles close to @xmath137 .",
    "this change in texture can not be described in the eshelby formalism , which supposes that the material is continuous .",
    "we do not think that this difference of texture is due to the disorder of the contacts between grains , but likely due to sliding contacts .",
    "indeed , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 , there are many sliding contacts ( up to @xmath171 and @xmath172 of all contacts , respectively ) but at @xmath28 , sliding contacts remain relatively rare ( less than @xmath173 of all contacts ) .",
    "the permanence of the quadrupolar structure at large scale shows than an elastic description of a granular material can co - exist with different mesoscopic behaviors : either force chains ( @xmath139 or @xmath28 ) or sliding contacts ( large @xmath20 and @xmath174 ) .",
    "when many contacts are sliding , the granular matrix does not behave as an elastic material .",
    "we then expect a stress redistribution which differs from the elastic eshelby response .",
    "however , at large scales , we still see in fig .",
    "[ fig : eshelby - example ] the eshelby structure which is a characteristic of the material elasticity .",
    "it is unclear if it is possible to quantify objectively such a separation of scales .",
    "in this paper , we considered the effect of a local transformation on the mechanical stress distribution .",
    "for this , we applied the theoretical construction proposed by eshelby to numerical simulations where extra forces are applied on some grains inside a granular material . in response to this",
    "local applied stress , the material relaxes stress at large distance .",
    "this stress relaxation may be , at least in some cases , successfully described by a theory where the granular material is treated as a continuous and elastic material .",
    "the presence of disorder of contact forces ( such as the so called force - chains ) does not disrupt this elastic response , at least at the macroscopic scale . if sliding contacts are supressed , we show that the material remains elastic at the macroscopic scale , even close to failure , but the elastic coefficients become anisotropic .",
    "our numerical simulations are performed with beads of finite stiffness .",
    "the ratio @xmath175 between the confining pressure and the contact stiffness , is the typical value of the relative deformations of the beads .",
    "it is interesting to compare it to a real 3d experiment .",
    "if we consider glass beads following hertz law which are confined under a pressure @xmath176 , we may estimate a relative deformation of the beads of @xmath177 .",
    "so the value of the relative deformation is of the same order of magnitude as many biaxial compression experiments , such as experiments where stress relaxations along preferential directions are observed  @xcite .",
    "some departures from the elastic behavior are clearly visible in our simulations .",
    "they may be linked to the occurrence of sliding contacts .",
    "the departure from an elastic response of the matrix is an interesting , but very challenging , problem .",
    "we may expect that the granular skeleton behaves elastically for deformations of the inclusion which are smaller than some plasticity threshold @xmath178 .",
    "the variation of @xmath178 with the microscopic friction coefficient @xmath13 , with the reduced stiffness of the beads @xmath179 , and with the proximity of the material failure are still unknown .",
