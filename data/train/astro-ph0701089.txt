    "while the first - year results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment @xcite overall clearly supported the currently popular inflationary cosmological model , describing a flat , isotropic and homogeneous universe seeded by gaussian and adiabatic fluctuations , a disturbing number of unexpected anomalies on large scales were reported shortly after the public data release .",
    "perhaps the three most important ones were : 1 ) alignments and symmetry features among low @xmath3 multipoles @xcite , 2 ) an apparent asymmetry in the distribution of fluctuation power in two opposing hemispheres @xcite , and 3 ) a peculiar cold spot in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "all of these features were subsequently studied extensively by independent groups , and all remain unresolved to the present day .    in march 2006",
    "the three - year wmap results were released , prompting researchers to revisit the anomalies detected in the first - year data @xcite .",
    "of course , considering that already the first - year data were strongly signal - dominated on the scales of interest , it should come as no surprise that most of these analyses concluded with similar results as for the previous data , although different foreground handling could affect some results .",
    "the wmap team paid particular attention to the question of large - scale power asymmetry in their analyses @xcite .",
    "specifically , in an early version of their paper , @xcite approached the problem from a semi - bayesian point of view , by defining a parametric model consisting of an isotropic and gaussian cmb field modulated by a large - scale function .",
    "the power asymmetry anomaly was then addressed by a dipolar modulation field , and the low-@xmath3 alignment anomalies were studied with a quadrupole modulation field . however , due to several issues with this early analysis , several of which were first addressed by the present paper , the authors decided to remove the corresponding section from the final version of their paper @xcite .",
    "one example is simple marginalization over non - cosmological monopoles and dipoles components , which was first done by @xcite in an otherwise identical analysis .",
    "a second example was the limited harmonic range considered by @xcite .",
    "thus , we present in this letter the first complete modulation analysis that covers the full range of angular scales presented by @xcite , and that takes into account all known sources of systematics , such as monopole / dipole and foreground marginalization",
    ". we also present the first proper computation of the bayesian evidence for the modulated model .",
    "following the first report of the power asymmetry , much effort has been spent by theorists on providing possible physical explanations .",
    "examples range from those questioning the very fundamentals of physics and cosmology ( e.g. , introducing intrinsically inhomogeneous cosmologies ",
    "moffat 2005 and jaffe et al .",
    "2005 ; violation of lorenz invariance  kanno & soda 2006 ; or violation of rotational invariance in the very early universe  ackermann , carroll & wise 2007 ) to those essentially considering special cases of established physics ( e.g. , second - order gravitational effects from local inhomogeneities ",
    "tomita 2005 ; the presence of local voids  inoue & silk 2006 ; spontaneous isotropy breaking from non - linear response to long - wavelength density fluctuations  gordon et al.2005 ) .",
    "we now outline the methods used for the analyses presented in the following sections .",
    "we model the cmb temperature sky maps as @xmath4    + \\mathbf{n}(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a statistically isotropic and gaussian random field with power spectrum @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a dipole modulation field with amplitude less than unity , and @xmath8 is instrumental noise .",
    "thus , the modulated signal component is an anisotropic , but still gaussian , random field , and therefore has a covariance matrix given by @xmath9 \\mathbf{s}(\\hat{\\mathbf{n } } , \\hat{\\mathbf{m}})[1+f(\\hat{\\mathbf{m}})],\\ ] ] where @xmath10    taking into account instrumental noise and possible foreground contamination , the full covariance matrix is @xmath11 the noise and foreground covariance matrices depend on the data processing , and will be described in greater detail in  [ sec : data ] . with these definitions",
    "ready at hand , the log - likelihood is given by @xmath12 up to an irrelevant constant .",
    "the posterior distribution @xmath13 is a primary goal of any bayesian analysis , @xmath14 being the set of all free parameters in the model . for the model defined above",
    ", the free parameters can be divided into two groups , namely those describing the isotropic cmb covariance matrix or @xmath6 , and those describing the modulation field .",
    "both may be parametrized in a number of different ways , and these choices may affect the outcome of the analysis through different prior definitions .",
    "first , for the isotropic cmb component , we choose to parametrize the power spectrum in terms of a simple two - parameter model with free amplitude @xmath15 and tilt @xmath16 , @xmath17 here @xmath18 is a pivot multipole and @xmath19 is a fiducial model , in the following chosen to be the best - fit power law spectrum of @xcite .",
    "second , the modulation field @xmath20 is parametrized in terms of a direction @xmath21 and an overall amplitude @xmath22 , @xmath23    we use flat priors on all parameters in this paper ; the modulation axis is uniform over the sphere , and the amplitude is restricted to @xmath24 .",
    "the power spectrum parameters are restricted to @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these choices are sufficiently generous to include all non - zero parts of the likelihood .",
    "the posterior distribution , @xmath27 is then mapped out using a standard markov chain monte carlo technique .",
    "we use a gaussian proposal density for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath22 , and an euler - matrix based , uniform proposal density for @xmath21 .      in a bayesian analysis",
    ", one is not only interested in the set of best - fit parameter values , but also in the relative probability of competing models .",
    "the most direct way of measuring this is through the bayesian evidence , @xmath28 which is simply the average likelihood over the prior volume . typically , one computes this quantity for two competing models , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and considers the difference @xmath31 . if @xmath32 , the evidence for @xmath30 is considered substantial ; if @xmath33 , it is considered strong .",
    "traditionally , computation of evidences has been a computational challenge .",
    "however , @xcite introduced a method called `` nested sampling '' , proposed by @xcite , to the cosmological community that allows for accurate estimation of the evidence through monte carlo sampling .",
    "we implemented this for the priors and likelihood described above , and found that it works very well for the problem under consideration .",
    "we also perform a standard frequentist maximum - likelihood analysis by computing the maximum - likelihood modulation parameters for isotropic monte carlo simulations . for these computations",
    ", we use a modified version of the evidence code , which we find to be considerably more robust than a simple non - linear search ; while the non - linear search algorithms often get trapped in local minima , the nested sampling algorithm always find the correct solution , but of course , at a considerably higher computational expense .",
    "we analyze two versions of the three - year wmap sky maps in the following ; the template - corrected @xmath34- , @xmath35- , and @xmath36-band maps , and the `` foreground cleaned '' internal linear combination ( ilc ) map @xcite .",
    "all maps are processed as described by @xcite : they are first downgraded to healpix resolution @xmath37 , by additional smoothing to a @xmath38 fwhm gaussian beam and appropriate pixel window .",
    "second , uniform gaussian noise of @xmath39 is added to each pixel in order to regularize the pixel - pixel covariance matrix .",
    "this combination of smoothing and noise level results in a signal - to - noise ratio of unity at @xmath40 , and strong noise domination at the nyquist multipole of @xmath41 .",
    "we use two different sky cuts for our analyses .",
    "first , given that the galactic plane is clearly visible in the single frequency data , our first mask is conservatively defined .",
    "this cut is created by expanding the kp2 mask @xcite by @xmath38 in all directions , and then manually removing all near - galactic pixels for which any difference map between two channels are clearly larger than noise . in total ,",
    "36.3% of all pixels are rejected by this cut ( see figure [ fig : modulation_maps ] ) .",
    "second , we also adopt the directly downgraded kp2 cut used by the wmap team that removes 12.8% of all pixels .",
    "we use this mask for the ilc map only .",
    "the noise covariance matrix is given by the uniform noise only , @xmath42 .",
    "for completeness , we have also computed the noise covariance from the smoothed instrumental noise for the @xmath35-band data , but we find that this has no effect on the final results , since its amplitude is far below the cmb signal .",
    "it is therefore omitted in the following .",
    "lccccc ilc & ( @xmath43 ) & @xmath44 & 6.1 & @xmath45 & 0.991 + ilc & ( @xmath46 ) & @xmath47 & 6.0 & @xmath45 & 0.991 + @xmath34-band & ( @xmath48 ) & @xmath49 & 5.5 & @xmath50 & 0.987 + @xmath35-band & ( @xmath51 ) & @xmath52 & 5.6 & @xmath50 & 0.990 + @xmath36-band & ( @xmath53 ) & @xmath54 & 5.2 & @xmath55 & @xmath560.985    as an additional hedge against foreground contamination , we marginalize over a set of fixed spatial templates , @xmath57 , through the covariance matrix @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "monopole and dipole terms are always included , and one or more foreground templates .",
    "for the @xmath35-band and ilc maps , we follow @xcite and adopt @xmath35ilc as our foreground template . for the @xmath34-band data , we marginalize over a synchrotron @xcite , a free - free @xcite , and a dust @xcite template individually .",
    "finally , for the @xmath36-band data , we use the @xmath36ilc difference map . however , we have tried various combinations for all maps , and there is virtually no sensitivity to the particular choice , or indeed , to the template at all , due to the conservative sky cut used .",
    "the results from the analysis outlined above are summarized in table [ tab : results ] . for each map , we report the best - fit dipole axis and amplitude , as well as the maximum log - likelihood difference and bayesian evidence difference for the modulated versus the isotropic model .",
    "the errors on the evidence are estimated by performing eight independent analyses for each case , and computing the standard deviation @xcite .",
    "we also compute the probability of obtaining a smaller modulation amplitude than the observed one by analyzing 1000 isotropic monte carlo simulations .    starting with the first case in table [ tab : results ] ,",
    "the ilc map cut by a 12.8% mask , we see that the best - fit modulation axis points toward @xmath60 , and the corresponding modulation amplitude is 0.114 . the raw likelihood improvement is @xmath61 .",
    "the probability of finding such a high modulation amplitude in intrinsically isotropic simulations is @xmath2% , and , finally , the improvement in bayesian evidence is @xmath62 .",
    "further , these results are not sensitive to data set or sky coverage : even the q - band map , which presumably is the least reliable with respect to residual foregrounds , yields a modulation amplitude which is high at the 98.7% ( frequentist ) confidence level , and a bayesian log - evidence improvement of 1.5 .",
    "this frequency independence is further illustrated in figure [ fig : amplitude ] , where we show the marginalized posterior distributions for the modulation amplitudes for each data set .",
    "the agreement among data sets is very good .    in figure",
    "[ fig : modulation_maps ] we show the dipole axis posterior distribution for the ilc map and 36.3% sky cut . superimposed on this",
    ", we have also marked the first - year asymmetry axis reported by @xcite [ @xmath63 in yellow , and also the other axes listed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "all agree well within @xmath64 , and this is another testimony to the excellent stability of the effect with respect to statistical method , data set and overall procedure .    finally , we note that this model may also partially explain the anomalous cold spot reported by @xcite and @xcite : by demodulation the spot would increase its temperature by about 10% , and although still very cold , it would be significantly less extreme .",
    "similar arguments could possibly also be made for the bianchi vii@xmath65 correlation found by @xcite .",
    "these issues will be considered further in future work .",
    "a notable power asymmetry between two opposing hemispheres in the first - year wmap sky maps was reported by @xcite .",
    "this feature may be observed as strong fluctuations in the southern ecliptic hemisphere , but virtually no large - scale structure in the northern ecliptic hemisphere ( e.g. , hinshaw et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we have revisited this issue in the three - year wmap data , adopting the statistical framework introduced and applied by @xcite . with these tools , we find that the evidence for power asymmetry in the wmap data is very consistent with that initially reported for the first - year maps by @xcite , and the wmap data clearly suggest a dipolar distribution of power on the sky : the best - fit modulation amplitude is roughly 12% in real space , or about 20% in terms of power spectra .",
    "the corresponding dipole direction is @xmath66 .",
    "all results are independent of data set choices , i.e. , frequency channel or sky cut .",
    "however , the statistical evidence for this effect is still only tentative . in frequentist language",
    ", the significance is about 99% , while in bayesian terms , the log - evidence difference is @xmath67 to 1.8 , corresponding to odds of one to five or six .",
    "this is quite comparable to the evidence for @xmath68 after the three - year wmap data release , for which the odds are about one to eight in the highest case ( parkinson et al .",
    "thus , there is still a chance that the effect may be a fluke , and most likely , this will remain the situation until planck provides new data in some five years . with additional frequency coverage ,",
    "a better job can be done on foreground treatment , and more sky coverage can be reliably included in the analysis .",
    "second , full - sky and high - sensitivity polarization data should provide valuable insights on the origin of the effect .",
