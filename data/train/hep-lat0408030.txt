    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental theory of hadron physics .",
    "it specifies elementary interactions at the level of quarks and gluons , which serve as building - blocks to construct complicated interactions among hadrons . at high energy , the qcd coupling constant diminishes due to asymptotic freedom , and perturbative qcd works well . at low energy , however , with the growth of the qcd coupling constant , perturbation theory breaks down , and the system is dominated by non - perturbative effects .",
    "one of the most important features of non - perturbative qcd is color confinement , i.e. , all hadrons are formed as color singlet combinations of quarks and gluons . in the conventional picture , mesons consist of a quark and an antiquark , while baryons are made of three quarks .",
    "qcd , however , allows more general hadrons , often called exotic hadrons , which contain extra pairs of quark and antiquark , or gluons .",
    "possible candidates include multiquark hadrons , glueballs , and hybrid hadrons .",
    "experimental searches found no manifestly exotic hadrons before the year 2002 .",
    "therefore , the discovery of the manifestly exotic narrow resonance @xmath8 by leps group at spring-8 was an epoch making event in the hadron physics @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 is confirmed to have baryon number @xmath11 , charge @xmath12 and strangeness @xmath13 .",
    "it has to contain at least one anti - strange quark and its simplest configuration is @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 is a manifestly exotic penta - quark state .",
    "the experimental search @xcite of @xmath10 was motivated by a theoretical prediction given in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is noted that @xmath10 had been considered several times in the history @xcite .",
    "the discovered peak in the @xmath15 invariant mass is centered at @xmath16 gev with a width smaller than 25 mev .",
    "a number of groups @xcite confirmed the leps discovery , among which ref.@xcite claims that @xmath10 must be isoscalar , since no @xmath17 is observed in the @xmath18 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "numerous theoretical studies of penta - quark baryons have appeared since its discovery @xcite .",
    "one of the important issues is the spin and parity of @xmath10 .",
    "although @xmath19 is suggested in the original work of ref.@xcite based on the chiral soliton model , there is no direct experimental information available on spin and parity @xcite .",
    "an educated guess for the spin is @xmath6 , since the color - magnetic interaction favors smaller spin states in general .",
    "there is , however , no consensus on parity at all .",
    "experimental determination of the parity of @xmath10 happens to be quite challenging @xcite , while opinions are divided in theory@xcite .",
    "positive parity is supported by various model calculations , i.e. , soliton models @xcite , chiral bag model @xcite , the jaffe - wilczek s diquark model @xcite , the karliner - lipkin s diquark - triquark model @xcite , some quark model calculations @xcite , and other model calculations @xcite .",
    "negative parity is supported by some other quark model calculations @xcite , and qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "there are several lattice qcd studies of penta - quarks available @xcite , but they have not reached a consensus yet . except for ref.@xcite , all these calculations support that negative parity states are lighter than the positive parity ones and that positive - parity penta - quarks may appear at the mass above 2 gev .",
    "refs.@xcite claimed existence of a bound negative - parity penta quark , whereas ref.@xcite has observed no evidence for narrow resonances .",
    "naively , the negative result by ref.@xcite may be understood as a natural consequence of their choice of the nk - type interpolating field , since it is expected to couple strongly to the nk continuum state .",
    "therefore , under these circumstances , it is important to use various interpolating fields and accumulate more data to give a precise prediction .    the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "( i ) we provide a high - precision data on the penta - quark baryon @xmath10 by using the anisotropic lattice qcd .",
    "( ii ) we propose a new method , which enables us to distinguish compact penta - quarks from nk scattering states and apply it to the negative - parity @xmath10 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ section.interpolating.field ] , we discuss our choice of the interpolating field for the penta - quark @xmath10 , and introduce the parity projection .",
    "we adopt the standard wilson gauge action at @xmath1 on the @xmath20 lattice with the renormalized anisotropy @xmath21 .",
    "the use of the anisotropic lattice is known to serve as a powerful tool for high - precision measurements of temporal correlators @xcite . for quark action",
    ", we adopt @xmath2-improved wilson ( clover ) action with four values of the hopping parameter as @xmath22 .",
    "we also employ a smeared operator to enhance the low - lying spectra .    in sect .",
    "[ section.numerical.result.i ] , we present our numerical results for both positive and negative parity channels . for both cases ,",
    "we observe a rather stable plateau in the effective mass plot . for the positive parity case ,",
    "we obtain , after the chiral extrapolation , @xmath7 gev , which is much heavier than the observed @xmath8 . for the negative parity case ,",
    "we obtain @xmath9 gev , which is rather close to the empirical value .",
    "our data thus suggest that the negative - parity state is the ground state of the penta - quark spectrum .",
    "to clarify whether this negative parity state is really a localized resonance or not , we propose a new general method with a new `` _ hybrid boundary condition ( hbc ) _ '' for the quark fields .",
    "[ section.hybrid.boundary.condition ] is devoted to description of the hbc method . in the hbc method , the spatial boundary condition on the quark fields",
    "are artificially taken so that n and k must have non - vanishing spatial momenta , while it does not affect localized penta - quark states .",
    "as a consequence , the hbc raises the s - wave nk threshold by a few hundred mev without changing the mass of a compact resonance state , @xmath10 .    by applying the hbc method , we investigate the negative - parity state further .",
    "particularly , we examine difference of the spectra between the two boundary conditions .",
    "we find that , in the effective mass plots , the plateau is raised by about the same amount as the shift of the nk - thresholds .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no localized resonance state below @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "thus the state observed under the standard boundary condition turns out to be an nk scattering state . in sect .",
    "[ section.summary.and.discussion ] , a summary is given and possible implications of our results are presented .",
    "we consider a non - nk type interpolating field for the penta - quark @xmath10 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the dirac index , and @xmath27 are color indices .",
    "@xmath28 denotes charge conjugation matrix . the quantum number of eq .",
    "( [ sasaki - op ] ) is spin @xmath6 and isospin @xmath5 .",
    "it has an advantage that it can not be decomposed into a product of n and k in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "hence , we may expect that its coupling to nk scattering states is rather weak .",
    "this is the crucial difference between our calculation and that of ref.@xcite , who adopted the nk type interpolating field , which is expected to couple to nk scattering states strongly",
    ". the nk type interpolating field would not be an appropriate choice in studying the narrow penta - quark resonance in this sense .",
    "we present fierz rearrangements of eq .",
    "( [ sasaki - op ] ) in appendix .",
    "[ appendix ] .",
    "we can explicitly see that the nk component in the correlation function is suppressed by a factor 1/16 compared to that from the nk - type operator .",
    "this non - nk type interpolating field eq .",
    "( [ sasaki - op ] ) was adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite .    under the spatial reflection ,",
    "the quark fields transform as @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ sasaki - op ] ) transforms as @xmath30 this means that the intrinsic parity of eq .",
    "( [ sasaki - op ] ) is positive . although the intrinsic parity of eq .",
    "( [ sasaki - op ] ) is positive , it couples to negative parity states as well @xcite . in the dirac representation",
    ", one sees that the upper ( lower ) component creates positive ( negative ) parity states .",
    "in addition , in lattice formulation with limited temporal extension , it may create backwardly - propagating state with opposite parity . since the parity projection of baryon is thus involved , we explain our strategy of parity projection .",
    "we consider the asymptotic behavior of the zero - momentum projected correlator as @xmath31 in large @xmath32 and large @xmath33 region .",
    "( @xmath34 and @xmath35 refer to the spatial volume and the temporal size of the lattice , respectively . ) in this region , the correlator is assumed to be dominated by the lowest - lying states of each parity , and is decomposed into two parts in the following manner @xcite : @xmath36 where the choice of `` @xmath37 '' depends on the boundary condition of quark fields in imaginary time , i.e. , `` @xmath38 '' for anti - periodic boundary condition and `` @xmath39 '' for periodic boundary condition . @xmath40 and @xmath41 refer to the energies of lowest - lying states in positive and negative parity channels , respectively .",
    "@xmath42 work as projection matrices onto the `` upper '' and the `` lower '' dirac subspaces , respectively .",
    "we consider the first term in eq .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) . in the region",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 is expected to dominate the correlator , whereas , in the region @xmath45 , @xmath46 is expected to dominate the correlator . in the intermediate region ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath47 , the contributions from the both terms can not be negligible . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) behaves in a similar manner . in this way , by confining ourselves to the region @xmath48 , and by applying the projection matrices @xmath49 to @xmath50 , we can pick up the positive and negative parity states separately .",
    "one may point out that the exact parity projection can be achieved by summing up @xmath51 and @xmath52 , because the backwardly - propagating contributions cancel .",
    "this is often used to project parity for ordinary `` three - quark '' baryons at quenched level .",
    "however , in the case of penta - quark , this may not work even in quenched level , because the five - quark system can decompose into n and k so that n may propagate forward whereas k may propagate backward or vice versa @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]       +    before presenting the results for @xmath10 , we have to convince ourselves that localized resonance states are really insensitive to the change of boundary condition . for this purpose",
    ", we apply the hbc to the @xmath53(@xmath54 ) baryon , which is an established localized resonance .",
    "we take @xmath53 rather than the nucleon , because @xmath53 contains even numbers of @xmath55 and @xmath56 quarks .",
    "hence , @xmath53 is subject to the periodic boundary condition , and can have zero spatial momentum .",
    "therefore , if the mass of @xmath53 is affected by the choice of the bc , it is attributed to a change of intrinsic structure . in fig",
    "[ fig.sigma ] , we show effective mass plots of @xmath53 baryon correlators adopting the typical set of hopping parameter eq .",
    "( [ typical.set ] ) .",
    "the upper one corresponds to the standard bc , and the lower one to the hbc .",
    "we see that the plateau is raised by only a negligible amount due to the change of the boundary condition .",
    "this example explicitly shows that localized resonance states are insensitive to the change of the boundary condition .",
    "now , we present the numerical result of negative parity @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.hybrid ] , we show the effective mass of negative parity @xmath10 imposing the hbc adopting @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the region @xmath59 , the effective mass decrease monotonically as before .",
    "there is a plateau in the region @xmath60 . beyond @xmath61 ,",
    "the plateau breaks down due to the contributions from backwardly - propagating positive parity states .",
    "hence , we simply neglect the data for @xmath62 , and perform the single - exponential fit in the plateau region , @xmath63 .",
    "the solid line denotes the result of the single - exponential fit .",
    "the dotted line denotes the modified nk threshold , i.e. , @xmath64 with @xmath65 due to the hbc .    comparing fig .",
    "[ fig.hybrid ] with fig .",
    "[ fig.effmass.negative ] , we observe that the plateau is raised by about 200 mev , which coincides with the shift of the nk threshold . in fig .",
    "[ fig.hikaku ] , we compare the result of hbc with that of standard bc for each hopping parameter @xmath3 for the negative parity @xmath10 .",
    "closed circles denote the results obtained with best - fit analysis .",
    "solid lines show the corresponding nk thresholds . for all @xmath3",
    ", we see that the best - fit masses(@xmath66 the location of the plateaus ) are raised by about the same amount as the corresponding nk thresholds . therefore , we find that there is no localized resonance states below @xmath67 with @xmath68 . as a result",
    ", we conclude that the negative parity state observed before is an nk scattering state .",
    "\\(i ) the fully anti - periodic boundary condition is less convenient for our purpose . in fact , in this case , k is subject to the periodic boundary condition , whereas n and @xmath10 are subject to the anti - periodic boundary condition .",
    "since k can have the zero momentum , the shift of the nk threshold is smaller .",
    "in addition , @xmath10 must have non - zero momentum , which raises the location of @xmath10 due to the kinematic reason .",
    "it is easy to understand that the resulting spectrum is less convenient for our purpose .",
    "\\(ii ) it is possible to use the hbc in the study of the positive parity state .",
    "however , since the change of the minimum momenta amounts to only a minor modification from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , the resulting change in the spectrum is less significant than the negative parity state .",
    "( iii ) the hbc provides us with a general tool , the use of which is not restricted to the calculation of @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , it can be used in the study of the hadronic molecules .",
    "hadronic molecules are bound state of two or more hadrons .",
    "the binding energies are typically @xmath71 mev . in the lattice",
    "qcd studies , the gap of @xmath71 mev may be too small to confirm the existence of the bound state .",
    "therefore the hbc is useful by enlarging this gap to a few hundred mev .",
    "+ ( iv ) careful reader may point out that , besides the stable plateau which we discussed , there is a small plateau - like structure in fig .",
    "[ fig.effmass.negative ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.hybrid ] in the region @xmath72 .",
    "however , this `` plateau '' is also raised by about 200 mev due to the hbc .",
    "this means that this region is not dominated by a single state , and a possible reason of this shift would be that contaminations of low - lying states becomes reduced in the hbc .",
    "still , the nature of this small plateau can not be determined from our data available so far . at any rate",
    ", we can state that it does not correspond to the experimentally observed @xmath8 , because its location is rather high @xmath73 gev even after the chiral extrapolation .",
    "note that we do not find such a plateau - like structure in the effective mass plot with a point source and a point sink .",
    "we have studied the penta - quark baryon @xmath10 in anisotropic lattice qcd at the quenched level .",
    "we have used the standard plaquette action for gauge field configurations on the anisotropic lattice of the size @xmath74 with the renormalized anisotropy @xmath75 at @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath76 fm , @xmath77 fm . for quarks ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath2-improved wilson ( clover ) action with four values of hopping parameters as @xmath78 . to enhance the low - lying spectra ,",
    "we have adopted a spatially extended operator .",
    "we have used 504 gauge field configurations to construct the correlator of a non - nk type interpolating field . for each parity channel , we have found a rather stable plateau , where the single exponential fit has been performed .",
    "after the chiral extrapolation , we have found @xmath7 gev for positive parity state , which is too heavy to be accepted as the experimentally observed @xmath8 . for negative parity case ,",
    "we have obtained @xmath9 gev , which is rather close to the empirical value .",
    "our data have thus suggested that the negative parity state is the lowest of the penta - quark spectrum .    in order to clarify whether this negative parity state is a localized resonance or",
    "not , we have proposed a new method with `` _ hybrid boundary condition ( hbc ) _ '' , where the anti - periodic spatial boundary condition is imposed on the u and d quarks , while the periodic spatial boundary condition is imposed on the s quark . as results ,",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 , both of which contain odd numbers of u and d quarks , are subject to the anti - periodic spatial boundary condition , whereas @xmath81 , which contains even numbers of the u and d quarks , is subject to the periodic boundary condition .",
    "a remarkable feature of the hbc is that it raises the s - wave nk threshold by a few hundred mev without affecting the localized penta - quark resonance . by using the hbc method ,",
    "we have further investigated the negative parity state .",
    "we have found that the plateau is raised by about 200 mev due to the hbc , which is consistent with the shift of the nk threshold .",
    "we conclude that there is no localized resonance state below @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "it follows , in particular , that the negative parity state observed in the standard bc is a mere nk scattering state .",
    "now we discuss possible implications of our results .",
    "experimentally , a number of groups @xcite have confirmed the existence of @xmath8 .",
    "hence , it should be observed in lattice qcd monte carlo calculation as well .",
    "however , in neither positive nor negative parity states , we have found any relevant signals of narrow penta - quark states . in this way",
    ", we have arrived at a similar result as ref.@xcite .",
    "however , it should be remarked that this result has been obtained in spite of our choice of the non - nk type interpolating field .",
    "these two results suggest that @xmath10 may not be reachable by a simple five - quark interpolating field operator in lattice qcd it might have more complicated structure than expected .",
    "needless to say , it is desirable to examine the finite volume artifact and discretization error , as usual . it is also desirable to reduce the ambiguity from the chiral extrapolation . concerning the light quark effects",
    ", one might wonder that the dynamical quark effects might be important , because the narrow resonance @xmath10 was originally predicted by the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "after all , the skyrmion is a nontrivial configuration of pion .",
    "however , this argument is not quite correct , since the nucleon serves as a counter - example .",
    "a nucleon is indeed the ground state of in the skyrme model and thus contains a non - trivial configuration of pion .",
    "it is however also fairly well reproduced in quenched lattice qcd with conventional three - quark interpolating field .    besides these rather technical stuff",
    ", the difficulty may trace back to our insufficient understanding of the true nature of the penta - quark .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the following possibilities .",
    "\\(1 ) highly non - local structure : if the structure of @xmath10 is really the jaffe - wilczek type or the karliner - lipkin type , it may be better to invent series of new non - local interpolating fields , which have sufficiently complicated structures so that they can fit jaffe - wilczek / kaliner - lipkin pictures . in this respect ,",
    "the group theoretical construction of interpolating fields proposed in ref.@xcite together with the variational method would be interesting .",
    "\\(2 ) other quantum numbers : in most lattice qcd calculations of @xmath10 , spin of @xmath10 is assumed to be 1/2 .",
    "naively , one may expect that j=3/2 state would be heavier than j=1/2 states .",
    "however , since there is no experimental evidence on the spin of @xmath10 , it would be worth keeping j=3/2 and 5/2 possibilities as candidates .",
    "we have to keep in mind that @xmath10 is already a quite mysterious particle .",
    "in addition , although there is no evidence on the doubly charged @xmath17 in the experiment @xcite , it might be worth studying i=1 and 2 states as well , which have been suggested by ref.@xcite . since we do not know the production mechanism of the penta - quark , it might be better to keep them as possible candidates .",
    "\\(3 ) @xmath82 hepta - quark hypothesis : all the lattice qcd calculations for @xmath10 available so far are based on the quenched qcd .",
    "it is known that some hadrons are difficult to be reproduced in the quenched qcd .",
    "for instance , quenched lattice qcd can not reproduce @xmath83 as a three - quark state @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured to be a @xmath84 bound state . in this case",
    ", @xmath83 is a `` penta - quark '' .",
    "hence , it would be natural that mass of @xmath83 can not be properly reproduced in quenched lattice qcd with a standard three - quark interpolating field .",
    "actually , @xmath8 itself is hypothesized to be a bound state of @xmath85 , i.e. , the hepta - quark @xcite .",
    "if this is really the case , it would be natural that @xmath8 is difficult to be observed in quenched lattice qcd with `` ordinary '' penta - quark interpolating fields .",
    "however , concerning the hepta - quark picture , we should keep in mind that , in spite of its many good features , the interaction among @xmath82 system is said to be too weak to make a bound state with the binding energy of 40 mev .    in this way , it is necessary to perform more systematic studies of the penta - quarks in order to reveal its mysterious nature .",

    "<S> the penta - quark(5q ) baryon is studied in anisotropic quenched lattice qcd with renormalized anisotropy @xmath0=4 for a high - precision mass measurement . </S>",

    "<S> we investigate both the positive- and negative - parity 5q baryons with @xmath5 and spin @xmath6 using a non - nk - type interpolating field . </S>",
    "<S> after chiral extrapolation , the lowest positive - parity state is found to have a mass , @xmath7 gev , which is much heavier than the experimentally observed @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest negative - parity 5q appears at @xmath9 gev , which is near the s - wave nk threshold . to distinguish spatially - localized 5q resonances from nk scattering states , we propose a new general method imposing a `` _ hybrid boundary condition ( hbc ) _ '' , where the nk threshold is artificially raised without affecting compact five - quark states . </S>",
    "<S> the study using the hbc method shows that the negative - parity state observed on the lattice is not a compact 5q but an s - wave nk - scattering state . </S>"
