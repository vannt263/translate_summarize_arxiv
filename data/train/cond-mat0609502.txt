    "the strong electric correlation effect of @xmath5-electrons plays a crucial role in the systems . in the ce - compounds of cefe@xmath0p@xmath1 , cefe@xmath0as@xmath1 , ceru@xmath0p@xmath1 and",
    "ceos@xmath0p@xmath1 the energy gap has been estimated to be of 110 mev , 10 mev , 86 mev and 34 mev , respectively .",
    "[ 3,5 , 6 ] the energy gap is approximately proportional to the lattice constant in ce - based filled skutterudites .",
    "more interestingly , the non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior appears by the disappearance of the energy gap in the vicinity of fermi level at low temperatures , which is realized in ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1.[7 - 9 ] furthermore , ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 exhibits intermediate valence behavior in the magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivitiy in which an anomalous temperature dependence appears below about 100 k. the electronic contributions to the specific heat is rather large with 380 mj / mol k@xmath8.[7 ] recent optical and ultrahigh resolution photoemission studies found that ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 exhibits a charge gap feature below 70 k with the energy gap of @xmath9 = 47.1 mev.[10 ] a further interesting behavior : nfl appears below about 1k in the specific heat with the unusual ln@xmath6 dependence and below 5 k in the resistivity with a @xmath6@xmath10 dependence.[7 ]    recently , bauer @xmath11 @xmath12 . , have found that the resistivity of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 exhibits a semiconductor - like behavior at low temperatures with energy gap of 5 - 15 k by the use of an activated conduction law in the temperature range 25 k @xmath13 @xmath6 @xmath13 50 k.[11 ] they also estimated the kondo temperature @xmath6@xmath14 to be about 90 k. the relatively large specific heat coefficient @xmath15=@xmath2/@xmath6 of 96 mj / mol k@xmath8 indicates the formation of heavy fermion system at low temperatures .",
    "these experimental results indicate that the dense kondo system with the energy gap at the fermi level is realized in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility was explained by the crystalline electric field ( cef ) effect with the energy splitting of @xmath9 = 327 k between the @xmath16@xmath17 doublet ground state and the @xmath16@xmath18 quartet excited state .",
    "it also suggested that the ce ions are almost trivalent in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "the lattice parameters of reos@xmath0sb@xmath1 follow the lanthanide contraction at room temperature , at least.[12 ] the well - localized nature of ce ions expected by the cef effect is not consistent with the character of a dense kondo system with an energy gap .",
    "furthermore , ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 shows a pronounced anomaly at 0.9 k in the specific heat , indicating an intrinsic phase transition.[13 - 14 ] however , the estimated entropy is extremely small amount of 2@xmath19 of @xmath20ln2 which is expected by the @xmath16@xmath17 doublet ground state .",
    "thus , one can expect that this phase transition is not ascribable to the well - localized 4@xmath5 electronic state derived from the ce ion .",
    "interestingly , this transition shifts to higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field , reported by namiki @xmath11 @xmath12.[13 ] they proposed that this transition may be responsible for the instability of the fermi surface @xmath21.@xmath22 . , charge density wave ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) transition . in this way a dual character of 4@xmath5 electronic state of the ce ions : localized and/or itinerant nature has been reported in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 until now .",
    "ultrasonic measurements are particularly suited to study via the quadrupolar response of the 4@xmath5 electronic ground state split by the cef effect if the 4@xmath5 electrons are localized well .",
    "the elastic constants , as the quadrupolar susceptibility , measure the diagonal ( curie terms ) and off - diagonal ( van vleck terms ) quadrupolar matrix elements .",
    "the quadrupolar response of the 4@xmath5 electronic ground state split by cef effect causes a characteristic anomaly in the temperature dependence of the elastic constants due to the terms.[15 - 17 ] on the other hand , narrow quasiparticle bands with the possession of the enhanced effective mass cause elastic anomalies as well if the 4@xmath5 electrons are delocalized.[15 , 18 , 19 ] in this paper we report on the elastic properties of single - crystal ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 and ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 by means of ultrasonic measurements .",
    "the present results indicate that the observed elastic anomalies can not be explained well by the cef effect in both of the systems .",
    "alternatively , the 4@xmath5 electronic states of ce ions is explained reasonably by the itinerant picture with an energy gap at the fermi level in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",

    "the slight increase observed around 130 k in the temperature dependence of @xmath2@xmath3 , ( @xmath2@xmath3-@xmath2@xmath1)/2 and @xmath2@xmath4 seems to be related the anomalous behavior in the temperature dependence of the resistivity and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility begins to deviate significantly from the curie - weiss law expected in a trivalent ce ion state below 150 k and exhibits a broad peak around 100 k followed by an upturn below 50 k.[7 ] this characteristic behavior is seen in intermediate - valence ( iv ) compounds .",
    "furthermore , a slope of the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity is changed below around 150 k. a rapid decrease is observed below 80 k. [ 7 ] the present results indicate that the slight increase is related to the onset of the deviation of the magnetic susceptibility from the curie - weiss law .",
    "this may suggest that the valence state of ce in ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 begins to be unstable below around 150 k. in the case , the charge fluctuation of the ce ions usually has the strong influence on the bulk modulus @xmath2@xmath32 since it is related closely to the change of the total volume as seen in a representative of the mixed valence system smb@xmath41.[21 ] the slight increase observed around 150 k , thus seems to be ascribable to the change of the valence .",
    "however , it would be difficult to conclude that the slight increase is due to the instability of the electronic configuration of the ce ion at this stage , because the magnitude of the anomaly in @xmath2@xmath32 for ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 is much smaller than that for smb@xmath41 in which the mixed valence state is formed . nevertheless , again",
    ", this interpretation is consistent with that the valence state of ce in ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 becomes unstable at low temperatures suggested by the magnetic susceptibility and the lattice constant measurements.[7 , 8 ] most probably , a strong hybridization between the conduction electrons and the 4@xmath5-electronic state plays a crucial role at the temperature in this system .",
    "few influence of the nfl state on the elastic constants is recognized in this study .",
    "this might indicate that the origin is attributed to an irrelevant magnetic fluctuation , but not the relevant charge one to the elastic strain .",
    "let us move on the discussion of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "first , we mention the cef level scheme of the ce in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "the elastic softening toward low temperature , observed in well - localized 4@xmath5 electron systems , can be usually understood as the quadrupolar response of the system to external strain .",
    "this effect has its origin in the modulation of the cef by the strain .",
    "if one neglects the inter - site interaction between quarrupolar moments , the elastic softening toward low temperature can be analyzed with the following formula ( 1).[22 - 24 ]    @xmath42    here , @xmath43 and g@xmath44 are the number of ce ions in unit volume and the coupling constant between the quadrupolar moment and the relevant elastic strain , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 represents the irreducible representation : @xmath16@xmath28 and @xmath16@xmath45 for a cubic system .",
    "@xmath37@xmath44@xmath36(@xmath6 ) denotes the quadrupolar susceptibility for the 4@xmath5 electronic state in the cubic cef potential , which can be written as follows ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 represents the @xmath48-th eigenfunction of the @xmath49-th cef level .",
    "if the ground state is degenerate with respect to a quadrupolar moment @xmath50@xmath44 , a softening in the corresponding elastic constant is expected to occur due to the non - zero curie term .",
    "figure 9 shows the calculated results of a relative change of the elastic constant , @xmath51@xmath2@xmath44 for ( @xmath2@xmath3-@xmath2@xmath1)/2=-@xmath43g@xmath35@xmath37@xmath35@xmath36(@xmath6 ) and @xmath2@xmath4=-@xmath43g@xmath38@xmath37@xmath38@xmath36(@xmath6 ) based on the proposed cef level scheme in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1.[9 ] the calculated quadrupolar susceptibility @xmath37@xmath35@xmath36(@xmath6 ) and @xmath37@xmath38@xmath36(@xmath6 ) are belonging to the elastic constants both ( @xmath2@xmath3-@xmath2@xmath1)/2 and @xmath2@xmath4 , respectively . unfortunately it is impossible to compare quantitatively the present results to the theoretical ones based on the cef effect since ( @xmath2@xmath3-@xmath2@xmath1)/2 could not be measured in this study",
    "nevertheless , if the cef effect is dominant at low temperature i.e. , a well - localized picture can be adapted to ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , a pronounced softening is expected in both ( @xmath2@xmath3-@xmath2@xmath1)/2 and @xmath2@xmath4 . in particular , a minimum is expected in the temperature dependence of ( @xmath2@xmath3-@xmath2@xmath1)/2 around @xmath9/2= 165 k , where @xmath9 denotes the splitting energy of cef effect as shown in fig .",

    "if so , it is quite hard to account for the obtained results : a softening below 15 k in @xmath2@xmath3 only by the cef effect in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 . we need to postulate a different way to explain this softening . here",
    ", we argue the origin of the observed elastic softening below 15 k in @xmath2@xmath3 as follows . in the case of an electronic band with a large cyclotron effective mass , a coupling between the conduction electrons and the relevant elastic strains associated with a sound wave can be significant , and causes anomaly in the elastic constant as mentioned in introduction.[18 - 19 ] this essential coupling may be described by @xmath52    where , @xmath39@xmath53 , @xmath22@xmath53 and @xmath54@xmath53 denote the energy of the upper or lower quasiparticle band , the first and the second deformation potential coupling constants , respectively .",

    "furthermore , the rectangular density of states @xmath43@xmath64 for the upper and lower bands with the same band width @xmath65 were introduced .",

    "this inconsistency may be ascribed to the complicated band structure in the vicinity of fermi level @xmath58@xmath40 , and that the band gap has the strong temperature dependence as generally expected in conventional dense kondo semiconductors and semimetals .",
    "the multiple formation of the energy gap may be realized in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , which is developing by the change of temperature .",
    "secondary , we discuss the phase transition at @xmath6@xmath34 of 0.9 k. as mentioned in introduction , this is expected to be due to the instability of the fermi surface , such as charge density wave ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) transition because of the extremely tiny entropy release of 0.02rln2 at this temperature.[13 - 14 ] a steep decrease was observed in the elastic constants at @xmath6@xmath34 , which is quite different from that observed in a conventional magnetic ordering due to the well - localized 4@xmath5 electronic state.[17 , 23 ] a clear upturn , @xmath49.@xmath21 .",
    ", an abrupt elastic hardening is observed in that case such as ndfe@xmath0p@xmath1 which exhibits a ferromagnetic transition at 1.9 k with full release of the magnetic entropy of @xmath20ln4 expected by the quartet ground state.[2 , 26 ] this experimental fact may also indicate that the phase transition at @xmath6@xmath34 is due more to the conduction electron state than the localized 4@xmath5-electronic state .",
    "interestingly , this transition shifts to higher temperatures with increasing field , which is consistent with the results of the specific heat measurement .",
    "this behavior let us conjecture that of a quadrupolar ordering as seen in ceb@xmath41 and tmte , or a ferromagnetic transition.[27 - 29 ] this model , however can not explain the extremely tiny entropy release at @xmath6@xmath34 as mentioned above .",
    "recently , a ferromagnetic ordering with the tiny entropy release was reported in some other filled skutterudite compounds such as pr@xmath66la@xmath67fe@xmath0p@xmath1 being for @xmath68=0.05 and 0.15 , and smfe@xmath0p@xmath1 in which the extremely heavy fermion system is realized.[30 , 31 ] we suggested that their systems are close to the quantum critical point ( qcp ) just followed disappearance of a magnetic or quadrupolar ordering phase.[32 ] it is pointed out that the instability of fermi surface arisen from a strong hybridization plays a crucial role for this ferromagnetic transition .",
    "again , the present results let us conjecture that such a peculiar magnetic transition may occur at @xmath6@xmath34 of 0.9 k in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "the origin of the phase transition in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 is left to the future studies .",
    "thirdly , we discuss the selective connection between the elastic softening and the fermi surface from the viewpoint of their symmetry in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 . according to the de haas- van alphen",
    "effect measurement and the band calculation of the reference material laos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , the fermi surface consists of the closed hole surface derived from the 47th band centered at the @xmath16 point and the closed and multiply connected hole surfaces from 48th band.[33 , 34 ] especially , the multiply connected hole surface is relevant to the heavy electrons through the correlation effect , whose main parts are centered at the n point.[33 ] the band structure calculations in laos@xmath0sb@xmath1 indicate that the fermi surface of the band is missing in the direction of @xmath25100@xmath26 and @xmath25111@xmath26 , and their equivalent .",
    "it can therefore be presumed that this multiply connected hole surfaces has the strong deformation coupling with the relevant elastic strain induced by the sound wave .",

    "this interpretation can explain reasonably the obtained results .",
    "in addition , a slight change was observed in the temperature dependence of @xmath2@xmath3 around 30 k in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "it would be difficult to conclude at present whether this anomaly is intrinsic or not .",
    "the reproducibility of the date was confirmed in the present study .",
    "however , no remarkable anomaly around this temperature has been observed in the other physical properties .",
    "if this is intrinsic this may be due to crystalline electric field ( cef ) effect proposed by bauer @xmath11 @xmath12,.[11 ] actually , the proposed cef level scheme is expected to cause a change of the slope in the temperature dependence of @xmath2@xmath3 and @xmath2@xmath4 around 35 k. another scenario is the thermally activated rattling motions of an off - center rare - earth atom in a cage of sb - icosahedron , recently suggested by goto @xmath11 @xmath12,.[35 , 36 ] the increase behavior of the elastic constant with decreasing temperature lets us conjecture that of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "very recently , we found a same behavior in the temperature dependence of the elastic constants of smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 [ 37 ] .",
    "these experimental facts suggest that the rattling motion of an off - center rare - earth atom is common feature in reos@xmath0sb@xmath1 . a relatively large lattice parameter or / and",
    "a relatively large size of the cage of sb - icosahedron in reos@xmath0sb@xmath1 may yield a condition for the rattling motion .",
    "this is left to future studies , and further experiments including the sound attenuation measurement with a large size of the single - crystal are strongly requisite .",
    "finally , we would like to make a comment on the common elastic feature in the filled skutterudite compounds that show semiconductor - like behavior in their electrical resistivity . prru@xmath0p@xmath1 and smru@xmath0p@xmath1",
    "exhibit a metal - insulator transition at 62.4 k and 16 k , respectively.[38 , 39 ] the electrical resistivity increases rapidly below the transition with decreasing temperature in the both compounds . except for the phase transition",
    "the similar behavior is seen in that of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , the characteristic softening toward low temperature was observed also in the temperature dependence of elastic constants of prru@xmath0p@xmath1 and smru@xmath0p@xmath1.[40 , 41 ] the common origin may cause the characteristic softening in these compounds . as we will report in the separated articles ,",
    "a clear softening was observed in the temperature dependence of the elastic constants(c@xmath3-c@xmath1)/2 and c@xmath4 below about 2 k in smru@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to explain them reasonably by the cef effect.[41 ] in prru@xmath0p@xmath1 a clear excitation of the cef level scheme was observed by the inelastic neutron scattering measurement.[42 ] the ground state of pr ion split by the cef effect expects such a characteristic softening in the temperature dependence . in these systems , it would be difficult to determine the primary origin to cause the elastic softening , @xmath49.@xmath21 .",
    ", being ascribable to the deformation potential or / and the cef effect only by results of ultrasonic measurements .",
    "again , we believe that the coupling between the elastic strain @xmath58@xmath70 or @xmath58@xmath74 and the heavy conduction electrons whose band is centered at the n point , plays a clue role in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 in causing the elastic anomaly in @xmath2@xmath3 . on the other hand , the characteristic elastic softening was not observed in ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 which exhibits a metallic behavior at low temperatures , exactly speaking non - fermi liquid behavior . the different manner in the temperature dependence of the elastic constants between ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 and isostructural ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1",
    "may provide an evidence of the gap formation in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1.the different electronic band structure in the vicinity of the fermi level would govern the observed elastic anomalies .",
    "interestingly , the similar feature is seen in the dense kondo compounds cenisn and isostructural cepdsn as well.[19 ]",
    "in this paper we have presented the elastic properties of the non - fermi liquid metal ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 and the dense kondo semiconductor ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "we have performed ultrasonic measurements to measure the temperature dependence and the field dependence of the elastic constants @xmath2@xmath3 , ( @xmath2@xmath3-@xmath2@xmath1)/2 and @xmath2@xmath4 for ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 , and @xmath2@xmath3 and @xmath2@xmath4 for ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , respectively . from our experiments",
    "the following conclusions have been obtained .",
    "a slight increase was observed around 130 k in the elastic constants of ceru@xmath0sb@xmath1 , where the magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivitiy exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence .",
    "the instability of the valence state in the ce ion may cause the elastic anomaly around 130 k. in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , on the other hand , a pronounced softening in the longitudinal @xmath2@xmath3 toward the @xmath6@xmath34 was observed .",
    "this can be explained reasonably by the coupling between the elastic strain @xmath58@xmath70 or @xmath58@xmath74 and the heavy conduction electrons whose band is centered at the n point . the energy gap @xmath9 and bandwidth @xmath65 were estimated to be about 5 to 6 k and 30 k , respectively .",
    "it is indicated , from this work , that the quesiparticles formed by the hybridization between the conduction electron band and the 4@xmath5 localized electrons play a crucial role in the low temperature properties of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , a steep decrease was observed in the elastic constants around @xmath6@xmath34 .",
    "although the origin of this phase is not clear at this stage , this elastic behavior is likely to be common in the other skutterudite compounds where a week magnetic ordering with a small amount of entropy release occurs at low temperatures .",
    "this behavior lets us conjecture the magnetic ordering originated in the itinerant heavy quasiparticles . for a further discussion ,",
    "it is necessary to make clear the magnetic structure in the ordered phase in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
