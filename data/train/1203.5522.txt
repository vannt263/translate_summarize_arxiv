    "@xcite ) , the arising picture for the perturbed situation deserves attention as we have already explained in @xcite , and we are going to study in details in the sequel .",
    "the present paper is then the second part of the previous one @xcite , in which the harmonic analysis aspects of the model were intensively studied .",
    "the reader is also referred to @xcite for some very interesting pivotal amenable models .",
    "we are going to investigate the physical application to the bec of the very fascinating picture which arises from the previous mathematical investigation .",
    "the physical underlying model concerns bardeen ",
    "cooper boson pairs in networks describing arrays of josephson junctions .",
    "the formal hamiltonian is the quartic bose ",
    "hubbard hamiltonian , given on a generic network @xmath4 by @xmath5 here , @xmath6 denotes the set of the vertices of the network @xmath4 , @xmath7 is the bosonic creator , and @xmath8 the number operator on the site @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . finally , @xmath10 is the adjacency operator whose matrix element @xmath11 in the place @xmath12 is the number of the edges connecting the site @xmath13 with the site @xmath14 ( in particular it is hermitian ) .",
    "the reader is referred to the seminal paper @xcite in which the theory of the superconductivity ( called bcs theory in honor of the authors ) has been firstly discussed .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that , in the case when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are negligible with respect to @xmath17 , the hopping term dominates the physics of the system . after neglecting such terms , putting for the resulting effective coupling constant @xmath18 , in principle different from @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and finally passing to the one ",
    "particle space , the model under consideration becomes the so  called pure hopping ones described by the _",
    "pure hopping one  particle hamiltonian _ which assumes the form @xmath20 here , @xmath10 is simply the adjacency of the fixed graph @xmath4 , acting on the hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "the constant @xmath22 is added just in order to have @xmath23 and does not affect the analysis at all .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the systematic investigation of the mathematical properties arising in non amenable cases considered here consisting of negligible additive perturbations of cayley trees .",
    "several interesting amenable models are treated in details in @xcite .",
    "the reader is also referred to @xcite for some promising experiments for the pure hopping model on the comb and star graphs ( see fig .",
    "[ figd ] ) pointing out an enhanced current at low temperature which might be explained by condensation phenomena .",
    "one of the first attempts to investigate the bec on non homogeneous amenable graphs , such as the comb graphs , was made in @xcite . in that paper , it was pointed out the appearance of a _ hidden spectrum _ in the low energy part of the spectrum , which is responsible of the finiteness of the critical density . in addition , the behavior of the wave function of the ground state , describing the spatial density of the condensate , was also computed .",
    "some spectral properties of the comb and the star graph were also investigated in @xcite in connection with the various notions of independence in quantum probability . in that paper , it was noted the possible connection between such spectral properties and the bec .    the systematic investigation of the bec for the pure hopping model on a wide class of amenable networks obtained by negligible perturbations of periodic graphs , has been started in @xcite .",
    "the emerging results are quite surprising .",
    "first of all , the appearance of the hidden spectrum was proven for most of the graphs under consideration .",
    "this is due to the combination of two opposite phenomena arising from the perturbation .",
    "if the perturbation is sufficiently large ( surprisingly , in some examples , it is enough that the perturbation is indeed finite ) , the norm @xmath24 of the adjacency of the perturbed graph becomes larger than the analogous one @xmath22 of the unperturbed adjacency . on the other hand ,",
    "as the perturbation is sufficiently small ( i.e. zero  density ) , the part of the spectrum @xmath25 in the segment @xmath26 $ ] does not contribute to the density of the states .",
    "this allows to compute the critical density @xmath27 at the inverse temperature @xmath28 for the perturbed model by using the integrated density of the states @xmath29 of the unperturbed one , @xmath30 the resulting effect of the perturbed model exhibiting the hidden spectrum ( i.e. when @xmath31 ) is that the critical density is always finite .",
    "the bridge between the mathematics and physics can be easily explained as follows .",
    "consider the bose  gibbs occupation number ( at the inverse temperature @xmath32 and chemical potential @xmath33 ) at low energies for the hamiltonian .",
    "after using taylor expansion , one heuristically gets @xmath34^{-1}=[\\b((\\|a\\|-\\m)i - a)]^{-1 } \\equiv \\frac1{\\b}r_a(\\|a\\|-\\m)\\,.\\ ] ] then the study of the bec is reduced to the investigation of the spectral properties of the resolvent @xmath35 , for @xmath36 , the latter being a very familiar object for mathematicians . due to the particular form ,",
    "as the bec phenomena are connected with the spectral properties for small energies of the hamiltonian , we can reduce the matter to the investigation of the spectral properties of the adjacency operator @xmath10 of the network close to @xmath22 .",
    "another relevant fact connected with the introduction of the perturbation , and thus with the lack of homogeneity , is the possible change of the transience / recurrence character ( cf .",
    "@xcite , section 6 ) of the adjacency operator .",
    "it has to do with the possibility to construct locally normal states exhibiting bec .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the last relevant fact is the investigation of the shape of wave function of the ground state of the model , describing the spatial distribution of the condensate on the network in the ground state of the hamiltonian . from the mathematical viewpoint , this is nothing else the perron frobenius generalized eigenvector of the adjacency ( cf .",
    "it appears then clear that the physical and the mathematical aspects of the topological model based on the pure hopping hamiltonian are strongly related .",
    "summarizing , the new and very surprising phenomena are the following .",
    "first the finiteness of the critical density is connected with the appearance of the _ hidden spectrum _ above the zero of the energy .",
    "it can be computed in a quite simple way for many amenable and non amenable models by using the _ secular equation _ , see section 6 of @xcite and section 3 of @xcite .",
    "this leads to the fact that the bec can appear also in low dimensional cases @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , not for all the models with finite critical density , it is possible to exhibit locally normal states ( those for which the local particle density is finite in the infinite volume limit ) describing bec . due to non homogeneity , particles condensate also in the configuration space , that is the system undergoes a `` dimensional transition '' .",
    "this phenomenon is connected with the _ transience / recurrence _ character of the adjacency operator of the network ( the last describing the hamiltonian of the system ) .",
    "another new aspect is the difference between the geometrical dimension of the network and the growing of the wave function of the ground state .",
    "the last is called _ perron  frobenius dimension _",
    "@xmath38 for volume growing networks and is computed through the behavior of @xmath39norms of the finite volume perron frobenius eigenvectors , all normalized to @xmath40 at a common root . if the geometrical dimension @xmath41 is greater than @xmath38 , then it is impossible to exhibit locally normal states describing the bec , whose mean density of the particles is greater than the critical one . surprisingly , there are non homogeneous networks for which @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( i.e. the comb graph @xmath44 , see fig . [ figg ] ) .",
    "in addition , there are also simple non homogeneous graphs exhibiting infinite critical density , but for which it is yet possible to exhibit locally normal states describing bec .",
    "such a very intriguing situation is summarized as follows .",
    "is the comb  shaped graph whose base ",
    "point is @xmath10 , @xmath2 is the critical density , r / t denotes the recurrence / transience character of the adjacency , bec ( @xmath45bec ) denotes the existence of locally normal states exhibiting bec ( exhibiting bec at any mean density @xmath46 ) . ]    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a similar situation also happens for some non amenable networks .",
    "the networks under consideration in the present paper are density zero additive perturbations of exponentially growing graphs made of homogeneous cayley trees , see fig .",
    "the models treated in the present paper are the perturbations @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , of the homogeneous cayley tree @xmath50 along a subtree isomorphic to @xmath51 , and @xmath52 respectively , see below , see also @xcite for the precise definition of such models and for further details .",
    "quite surprisingly , the emerging mathematical situation described in @xcite for such non amenable examples , is similar to that for the amenable graphs treated in @xcite .",
    "namely , we still find hidden spectrum , and the transience / recurrence character is determined by the transience / recurrence character of the negligible subgraph supporting the perturbation . finally , the infinite volume perron  frobenius eigenvector is exponentially decreasing far from the base  point supporting the perturbation .",
    "namely , concerning the wave  function of the ground state , we have precisely the same situation arising for the amenable situations treated in @xcite ( see fig . [ figd ] ) .    the first part of the present paper is devoted to describe general properties of ( bounded ) hamiltonians on networks equipped with an exhaustion such that the density of the eigenvalues of the underlying hamiltonian converges in the infinite volume limit to a cumulative function called _ integrated density of the states_. it includes as particular cases those arising by negligible perturbations of cayley trees as shown in @xcite",
    ". then we describe the general statistical properties of such models .",
    "in particular , a careful definition of the mean density and the possible amount of the bec condensate should be done , because of the non negligible effects of the boundary terms due to the possible lack of amenability .",
    "we pass to describe the existence of the dynamics associated to the pure hopping hamiltonian for the perturbed cayley trees .",
    "this is a delicate issue which is done in section [ dynkmss ] for all the cases under consideration .",
    "after that , by using the results in @xcite , in the transient case we write down the formula ( cf . ) for the natural class of states describing bec ( i.e. presenting a non negligible amount of condensate in the ground state wave  function ) .",
    "such states are kms ( i.e. equilibrium ) states for the dynamics previously investigated . as for the previous amenable models treated in @xcite , such states are infinite volume kms states whose mean density coincides with the critical one .",
    "this simply means that the condensate is allocated on a subgraph whose volume growth is negligible with respect to that of the unperturbed one .",
    "we end the paper by investigating the infinite volume behavior of finite volume gibbs states . due to the lack of amenability",
    ", such an investigation presents some very delicate technical difficulties arising by the unavoidable boundary effects .",
    "modulo such difficulties , the emerging situation seems to be in accordance with that described in @xcite , and summarized as follows .",
    "first , relatively to the general recurrent situation , it is indeed impossible to construct locally normal states exhibiting bec at all , even if the critical density is finite .",
    "in addition , in the all transient cases under consideration , it seems to be impossible to exhibit locally normal states describing bec at the mean density @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "finally , in the condensation regime where for the mean density @xmath1 of all such states @xmath55 , a careful choice of the sequence of the finite volume chemical potentials @xmath56 should be done . by considering the geometry of the graph @xmath4 and the @xmath39behavior of the ground state wave function @xmath57",
    ", such a choice corresponds to the local density of the condensate @xmath58 in the infinite volume limit @xmath59 , see proposition [ 3a3c ] .",
    "this is nothing but the naive explanation of the fact that @xmath55 for the locally normal states describing the condensation regime in all the situations under consideration .",
    "a _ graph _ ( called also a _ network _ ) @xmath60 is a collection @xmath61 of objects , called _ vertices _ , and a collection @xmath62 of unordered lines connecting vertices , called _",
    "edges_. usually , the edges describe the physical interaction between vertices . in our model describing the pure hopping interaction , multiple edges as well as self  interactions , are also allowed .",
    "let @xmath63 be the collection of all the edges connecting @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "we have @xmath66 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath67_{x , y\\in x}$ ] , @xmath68 , the _ adjacency matrix _ of @xmath69 : @xmath70 as explained in @xcite , all the geometric properties of @xmath69 are encoded in @xmath10 .",
    "for example , @xmath69 is connected if and only if @xmath10 is irreducible . setting @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "we have @xmath73 , that is @xmath10 is bounded if and only if @xmath69 has uniformly bounded degree . for connected networks ( or on each connected component ) we can define the standard distance @xmath74 @xmath75 being the length of the path @xmath76 ( i.e. the number of the edges in @xmath76 ) .",
    "the adjacency operator considerably differs from the laplacian @xmath77 , whenever @xmath69 is non homogeneous . on the other hand ,",
    "it was proven in theorem 7.6 of @xcite that the value of the critical density does not change under negligible perturbations on a fixed homogeneous graph , if the hamiltonian of the model is the ( opposite of the ) laplacian .",
    "thus , the main object for the investigation of the bec for the pure hopping model of inhomogeneous networks will be the adjacency operator . in the present paper , all the graphs are connected , countable and with uniformly bounded degree .",
    "in addition , we deal only with bounded operators acting on @xmath78 if it is not otherwise specified .",
    "let @xmath79 be a closed operator acting on @xmath78 , and @xmath80 the resolvent set of @xmath79 .",
    "as usual , @xmath81 denotes the _ resolvent _ of @xmath79 .    fix a bounded matrix with positive entries @xmath79 acting on @xmath78 .",
    "such an operator is called _ positive preserving _ as it preserves the elements of @xmath78 with positive entries .",
    "if @xmath79 is selfadjoint , @xmath79 is _ positive _ if @xmath82 for each @xmath83 .",
    "a sequence @xmath84 is called a ( generalized ) _ perron  frobenius eigenvector _ if it has positive entries and @xmath85 if such a vector is normalizable ( i.e. if it belongs to @xmath78 ) it is a standard @xmath78vector , otherwise it is a weight . in all the cases we simply call perron ",
    "frobenius eigenvector such a sequence by dropping the word generalized .",
    "suppose for simplicity that @xmath79 is selfadjoint .",
    "it is said to be _ recurrent _ if @xmath86 otherwise @xmath79 is said to be _ transient_. it is shown in @xcite , section 6 , that the recurrence / transience character of @xmath79 does not depend on the base  point chosen in computing the limit in .",

    "frobenius eigenvector is unique up to a multiplicative constant , if @xmath69 is finite or when @xmath79 is recurrent , see e.g. @xcite . in general",
    ", it is not unique , see the end of the present section for the case relative to the cayley trees .",
    "we say that an operator @xmath79 acting on @xmath78 has _ finite propagation _ if there exists a constant @xmath87 such that , for any @xmath88 , the support of @xmath89 is contained in the ( closed ) ball",
