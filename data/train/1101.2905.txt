    "analyzing the substructure of highly - boosted massive jets ( @xmath1 gev ) has proved to be useful for distinguishing new physics signals from the qcd background .",
    "for instance , jets originating from boosted electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite , tops  @xcite , higgs  @xcite , and even new physics particles  @xcite are all interesting targets of searches conducted at the tevatron and the lhc experiments , and it is therefore important to be able to distinguish them from qcd jets . for recent reviews on substructure techniques , experimental status and new physics searches",
    "see  @xcite and references therein .    one way to characterize jet substructure is to consider observables which are functions of the energy flow within the jet , namely the energy distribution @xmath2 as measured by the detector , where @xmath3 are the coordinates on the detector surface .",
    "examples of such observables include the jet mass and the angularities @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the jet energy , @xmath6 is the energy of particle @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the angle relative to the jet axis , and @xmath9 is a real parameter restricted to @xmath10 to ensure ir safety .",
    "another example is planar flow @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , which we discuss below in detail .",
    "while many observables have been defined , so far there has been no systematic way to classify them or to construct all observables at a given order in the detector resolution .",
    "the goal of the present work is to suggest such a classification for the case of narrow jets , as we now describe .",
    "an energy flow observable needs to meet several criteria .",
    "ideally , it should be lorentz invariant and ir - collinear ( irc ) safe . in practice",
    "it is difficult to find observables which are lorentz invariant  @xcite , the jet mass being an exception .",
    "we may however relax this requirement as follows .",
    "for highly - boosted , narrow jets with fixed 4-momentum the cross section factorizes at leading order into the hard process and the jet function ( in which we are interested ) .",
    "since the jet momentum is an input parameter of the jet function , it is enough to consider observables which are invariant under the subgroup of lorentz that does nt change the jet momentum . for a massive jet ,",
    "this little group is isomorphic to @xmath11 , as can be seen by boosting to the jet rest frame .",
    "another property of a jet is that it is contained in a cone of radius @xmath12 around its axis , and we should further restrict ourselves to lorentz transformations that leave the cone invariant such that each jet is contained in cones of radius @xmath13 , which is also generically the case for sufficiently hard jets found with sequential recombination algorithms .",
    "indeed , for narrow massive jets , it was shown that the angularity distributions are similar for a wide range of jet algorithms  @xcite . ] .",
    "the subgroup that stabilizes both the jet momentum and the cone is @xmath14 , the rotations around the jet axis .    in the present paper we focus on highly - collimated jets , working at leading order in the small cone size @xmath15 .",
    "we will further assume that all the particles that make up the jet are massless .",
    "under these assumptions , we propose a complete classification of energy flow observables which are ir safe and lorentz invariant , up to lorentz transformations that change the jet momentum and the cone .",
    "furthermore the observables may be naturally arranged as an expansion in terms of the energy resolution and the cone size ( or alternatively the energy and angular resolutions ) .    in the narrow cone approximation the experimental calorimeter information of the jet is fully specified by the energy distribution on a surface perpendicular to the jet axis , @xmath2 , with @xmath16 corresponding to a set of coordinates on the two dimensional jet surface . to obtain the classification , we begin by describing a given energy distribution @xmath2 in terms of its moments , @xmath17 observables are then constructed by taking products of these moments , and forming @xmath14 scalars by contracting their indices .",
    "invariance under boosts along the jet axis can be achieved by adding a factor of @xmath5 raised to some power .",
    "since our moments form a straightforward generalization of angularities with @xmath10 , they are manifestly ir safe .    moments of higher rank are of higher order in the cone size @xmath18 , since @xmath19 , the opening angle . moreover , since @xmath20 , observables that are products of a larger number of moments are more sensitive to errors in energy measurement ( we will be more precise about this point below ) .",
    "this allows us to arrange the observables in an expansion by energy resolution and cone size as will be shown in section [ moment - expansion ] . at the lowest orders in this expansion we find the jet mass and the angularity with @xmath21 . at the next order",
    "we find the angularity with @xmath22 and the planar flow .",
    "yet higher orders produce the whole tower of angularities with @xmath23 , as well as many new observables .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we review the definition of planar flow , showing how it naturally leads to the expansion of the energy distribution in terms of moments . in section  [ moment - expansion ]",
    "we define the moment expansion , find the first few observables , and precisely identify the small parameters in which we expand . in section",
    "[ first - few - orders ] we turn to a classification of the leading observables that characterize jets with up to 4 particles . in section  [ zernike - expansion ]",
    "we present an alternative approach to the study of jet substructure , based on an expansion in terms of orthogonal functions .",
    "finally , in section  [ epsi2i4 ] we analyze one of the new observables discovered in the classification , developing techniques that may be applied to other observables as well .",
    "section  [ discussion ] contains a few comments on the application of this formalism to the case of hadron colliders and our conclusions .",
    "planar flow is defined in terms of the matrix @xmath24 , with components than that of @xcite , without affecting the planar flow definition . ]",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the particle momentum in the detector plane , @xmath27 is the azimuthal angle , and @xmath28 the approximation is made under the narrow cone assumption .",
    "planar flow @xcite is then defined as @xmath29 one can easily verify that @xmath30 , that it vanishes when the energy distribution lies on a line , and that it is maximal for isotropic distribution .",
    "@xmath24 also enters in the definition of the jet mass . from @xmath31 , @xmath32",
    "it is easy to see that , in the narrow cone approximation , @xmath33 the narrow cone approximation ensures also that @xmath34 .",
    "now , let @xmath35 denote a coordinate system on the detector plane .",
    "then we may write @xmath24 as a sum over detector cells , where we weigh each cell by its total collected energy @xmath36 , namely @xmath37 one can define a normalized version of this tensor , @xmath38 where @xmath5 is the jet energy . for the sake of clarity let us rewrite the above expression in integral form , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the continuous , normalized energy distribution , given by @xmath41 note that @xmath42 equations and are quite suggestive . the function",
    "@xmath40 encodes all the information about the jet structure and it is the object we want to characterize .",
    "now , we have just seen that @xmath43 is its second moment and it gives rise to two interesting physical observables the jet mass and the planar flow .",
    "it is well known that all the information of @xmath40 is encoded in its moments .",
    "it is therefore plausible that expressing the energy distribution @xmath40 in terms of its moments would provide a natural way to derive observables with the desired properties .",
    "one can also expand the function @xmath40 in a set of orthogonal functions and characterize it in terms of its expansion coefficients .",
    "@xmath14 invariance will be ensured by taking suitable coefficient combinations that are singlets under rotation .",
    "the two approaches are complementary and can provide different insight on the properties of @xmath40 .",
    "these are the ideas that we will explore in the remainder of this work .",
    "the @xmath44-th moment @xmath45 of the energy distribution @xmath40 is defined by @xmath46 the zeroth moment is .",
    "the first moment is the expectation value , or dipole .",
    "it is set to zero by the requirement that the total transverse momentum of the jet vanishes , a state which can be reached by rotating the jet .",
    "this fixes the origin of the detection plane , which in turn determines the jet axis .",
    "we have then @xmath47    the first non - trivial moment is therefore @xmath48 , as expected .",
    "we are looking to define observables that are invariant under the little group @xmath14 , the lorentz subgroup that does nt change the jet momentum or the cone .",
    "@xmath14 has two independent invariant tensors , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the only @xmath14 scalar that is linear in @xmath48 is the normalized version of , namely @xmath51    next , consider a tensor product @xmath52 .",
    "there are three nontrivial scalars one may construct , @xmath53 of these , only two are independent , since @xmath54 also , the first scalar , @xmath55 , factorizes in lower - rank scalars .",
    "we therefore find only one new observable , @xmath56 , which is an un - normalized version of planar flow .    before proceeding with the expansion ,",
    "let us clarify in what sense the moment expansion is an expansion in small parameters .",
    "planar flow , composed of @xmath52 , is apparently of a higher order than the mass squared , composed of a single @xmath48 . to quantify this statement , first note that energy distribution is constrained to lie within a small cone of radius @xmath57 . since @xmath58",
    ", we have that @xmath45 scales as @xmath59 . as an expansion in @xmath18 , planar flow is of order 4 while the jet mass squared",
    "is of order 2 .",
    "another small parameter we may consider is the angular resolution @xmath60 , which is ultimately limited by the calorimeter cell size . including its effect gives @xmath61 .",
    "the error on the value of an observable due to the finite angular resolution is therefore proportional to the total rank of moments composing this observable .",
    "planar flow has error @xmath62 , while the mass squared has error @xmath63 .",
    "regardless of which small angular parameter we choose , measuring a moment of higher rank requires a more accurate detector .    as for the energy ,",
    "the only small parameter is the energy resolution @xmath64 .",
    "a single moment is proportional to @xmath40 , so for a given observable the error due to energy resolution will increase with the number of moments that make up the observable .",
    "planar flow will tend to have a larger error than the mass .",
    "we are now in a position to classify all the jet energy flow observables .",
    ".moment products that correspond to given orders in energy resolution @xmath64 and cone size @xmath18 .",
    "observables are constructed by contracting these products in various ways . [ cols=\">,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ moment - table ] lists the outer products that appear in the first few orders of the expansion .",
    "note that there are no observables with an odd power of @xmath18 since we can not fully contract an odd number of @xmath14 indices .",
    "each outer product may be contracted in several different ways , giving rise to different observables . however",
    ", algebraic relations will reduce the total number of independent contractions .    on top of this expansion",
    "it is useful to consider jets that consist of a given number of particles ( or detector cell towers ) .",
    "a jet of @xmath0 particles is characterized by @xmath65 variables , corresponding to the number of particle momentum components , minus the jet axis , the jet energy , and the @xmath14 angle associated to the overall rotation around the jet axis . for given @xmath0",
    "we can then identify the lowest order , lorentz - invariant observables that characterize such jets .",
    "let us list the observables for jets with up to 4 particles .",
    "the two lowest order observables are @xmath66 therefore , the natural observables for describing a two - particle jet are the mass and the angularity @xmath67 .    to describe 3-particle jets we need 3 more observables in addition to the mass and @xmath67 . as shown above , the outer product @xmath68 has one independent contraction , @xmath69 , the planar flow .",
    "next we have @xmath70 which has one contraction , @xmath71 corresponding to another member of the angularity family with higher @xmath9 .",
    "generally , @xmath72 with @xmath73 has only one contraction , @xmath74 , which corresponds to an angularity with @xmath75 .    at the next order",
    "we find @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , with the following independent contractions : @xmath79 the additional contractions @xmath80 , @xmath81 can be shown to be linearly dependent on these .",
    "any combination of them can be chosen as the remaining observable for 3-particle jets . in lumping @xmath78 with the rest we assumed for simplicity that energy and angular measurements have comparable weight in the small parameter expansion .",
    "of course , if this assumption is not true , @xmath78 may be preferred or disfavored in comparison with the other contractions .",
    "note that an observable  such as planar flow  which includes one or more @xmath82 symbols vanishes when all particles are on a line .",
    "axis , and then note that the @xmath82 tensor forces an @xmath83 factor to appear .",
    "this factor vanishes wherever @xmath84 . ]",
    "since two particles always lie on a line , these observables contribute at leading order to 3-particle jets .",
    "they can therefore be used to distinguish qcd jets , which favor 2-parton configurations , from e.g. top jets that favor 3-body decays .",
    "finally , 4-particle jets are described by eight variables .",
    "so far we found nine leading order observables , @xmath85 of these , any leading eight can be chosen to describe the jet .",
    "one can expand @xmath40 in a series of orthogonal functions .",
    "since @xmath86 is defined on a disc of radius @xmath18 , perhaps the most convenient expansion is in terms of the zernike polynomials  @xcite , which form an orthogonal basis on the unit disc .",
    "they are defined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 even , and @xmath90 are a set of polynomials of degree @xmath44 respecting the orthogonality condition @xmath91 the orthogonality among different @xmath92 s follows trivially from the orthogonality of the fourier modes .",
    "this set of functions is widely used in optics , in particular in the study of optical aberrations where the expansion coefficients have simple geometrical meaning .",
    "the expansion of the energy distribution is @xmath93 { \\,,}\\label{zexpansion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the conditions @xmath94 and @xmath95 fix @xmath96 , and @xmath97 to vanish .",
    "one can further expand the moments defined in section  [ moment - expansion ] in terms of the @xmath98 , finding that a moment of order @xmath99 will be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath98 s with @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , upon tracing over @xmath101 of the @xmath99 indices , @xmath92 will be constrained to be @xmath102 .",
    "an even / odd number of indices corresponds to @xmath92 ( and thus @xmath44 ) being even / odd .",
    "the lowest order invariants like the mass , the angularities with @xmath103 and planar flow have the following expression in terms of the zernike coefficients @xmath98 : @xmath104    in optics , the lowest order coefficients have been given names .",
    "in particular @xmath97 is the tilt , @xmath105 is the defocus , @xmath106 are the @xmath107 and @xmath108-astigmatism ( respectively ) , @xmath109 is the coma , and @xmath110 is the spherical aberration",
    ". the optical analogy may provide us with additional geometrical understanding of what is being probed by the jet shapes defined in the previous sections .",
    "we now try to gain some intuition regarding one of the new observables found in section  [ first - few - orders ] , . note that any observable which includes an odd number of @xmath50 symbols is a pseudo - scalar with respect to parity on the detector plane .",
    "it therefore vanishes for any energy distribution that is symmetric under reflection through an arbitrary axis .",
    "let @xmath112 be the @xmath113 moment traced once , namely @xmath114 .",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath112 are real , symmetric matrices , so we can write them in terms of the pauli matrices , @xmath115 the observable can then be written as @xmath116 note that @xmath117 does nt depend on the @xmath118 components ( the trace ) . treating @xmath119 as @xmath120 vectors ,",
    "we see that @xmath121 where the product is the cross product in @xmath120 which produces a pseudo - scalar .    to get further insight , let us compute the components of these vectors .",
    "we do this for a general moment @xmath122 with all indices traced except two .",
    "it is expanded in pauli matrices just like @xmath123 above , and we denote its corresponding @xmath120 vector by @xmath124 .",
    "we write the result using polar coordinates , @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath127    plug the zernike expansion of the energy distribution in @xmath128 .",
    "the @xmath27 integral picks out the @xmath129 modes , and the radial integral picks up a linear combination of @xmath130 , with @xmath131 sign for the cosine and @xmath132 sign for the sine .",
    "specializing for the cases @xmath133 we find : @xmath134 the observable can now be written as @xmath135 where we have dropped the piece in @xmath136 which is proportional to @xmath137 because of the usual properties of the determinant .",
    "this shows that , in this expansion of @xmath40 , @xmath117 depends only on the @xmath129 fourier modes for the angular part and on two specific combinations of the even , @xmath138 zernike modes .    finally , let us define the normalized observable @xmath139 which assumes values in the range @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "this observable is maximal when @xmath141 and @xmath142 are orthogonal , and vanishes when @xmath141 , @xmath142 are linearly dependent .",
    "this happens , for instance , when the energy distribution is invariant under reflection through some axis .",
    "indeed , in that case we may rotate this axis to coincide with the @xmath143 direction , following which @xmath144 since all the antisymmetric fourier modes vanish .",
    "this agrees with the fact that this observable is a pseudo - scalar .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 and @xmath112 differ only by a different weighing of the inner / outer part of the jets ( due to the additional @xmath145 in @xmath112 ) .",
    "a symmetric matrix defines a characteristic ellipsoid ( in the case of @xmath48 it is the ellipsoid of inertia in the detector plane ) .",
    "a non - zero @xmath146 determines by how much the principal axes of the ellipsoid rotate when we give extra weight to the outer portion of the jet .",
    "( in the language of optics it would correspond to measuring the relative orientation of the lowest and higher order astigmatism . ) with this intuition it is also trivial to see that @xmath147 vanishes when all the particles lie at the same distance from the jet axis .",
    "we will now briefly study some features of the @xmath147 distribution .",
    "while on an event - by - event basis @xmath147 will take both positive and negative values , in most cases the distribution will be symmetric around zero , yielding @xmath148 due to its pseudoscalar nature .",
    "a necessary condition for @xmath149 is that the substructure of the jet is controlled by a parity violating interaction .",
    "however , the interesting study of whether and when @xmath150 is non - zero is beyond the scope of this work ; here we will merely present distributions for @xmath151 in a few characteristic kinematic scenarios . since this observable vanishes for two - particle configurations , in fig .",
    "[ fig : on ] we present the distributions for three - particle final states .",
    "we include both the case of a pure one - to - three decay and the case of a three - body decay of particle a via two subsequent two - body decays , with an on - shell intermediate particle b ( as would be in the case of top decays ) . in the latter case one can see the sharp edge , whose position is just determined by the ratio and of the jet energy @xmath5 , if varied within reasonable ranges . ] @xmath152 .",
    "normalized distribution for various values of @xmath152 , the mother particle boost was fixed to @xmath153 . ]",
    "while the study presented in this paper is directly applicable to @xmath154 machines , let us briefly discuss its applicability to hadronic colliders , such as tevatron and the lhc . since the partonic center of mass system is unknown in a hadronic collision , one clearly has to have a definition for the moments which is invariant under boosts along the beam axis . at leading order in the narrow cone approximation this",
    "is trivially achieved by using @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( differences in pseudorapidity and in azimuthal angle ) for the @xmath143 and @xmath83 coordinates . in fact @xmath157",
    "depends only on @xmath158 and the ratios @xmath159 . since @xmath160 one finds that @xmath157 is also invariant at leading order in the narrow cone approximation .",
    "corrections start at @xmath161 and contaminate a moment of order @xmath99 with moments of order @xmath162 ( due to the additional powers of @xmath155 ) .",
    "however , being of higher order , they will be suppressed by powers of the cone size @xmath18 , rendering the contamination small .",
    "another difference with the @xmath154 case is in the structure of the intra - jet radiation . indeed in terms of symmetries",
    "the presence of beam remnants which can be color - connected with the jet under study provide a specific direction , common to all events , of breaking of the @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "while these effects have been widely studied in the literature in various contexts ( see _ e.g _  @xcite ) , it would still be interesting to see how they are represented in the language developed in this paper . while we will not embark here on a systematic study , we will sketch the analysis and outline a few results .",
    "one can relax the requirement of the @xmath14 invariance and still use the same formalism described in this paper to study these effects .",
    "in general there will be a set of directions corresponding to the beam axis , the directions of other jets in the event , etc .",
    "they identify two - dimensional unit vectors @xmath163 in the detector plane that can be used to contract the indices of the energy flow moment tensors .",
    "to lowest order and considering for simplicity the case of a single @xmath164 one has @xmath165 note also that in our counting of how many independent observables are present for an @xmath0-particle system , @xmath14 invariance eliminated one observable .",
    "therefore , while the underlying event and soft radiation from color reconnection can contaminate all the jet shape observables presented in this paper , at leading order there is room for only one observable able to probe these effects via a systematic @xmath14 non - invariance .",
    "this observable can be chosen to be any combination of the lowest order contractions such as the ones shown above .",
    "in particular it is worth noticing that @xmath166 is closely related to @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the pull variable defined in @xcite , the only differences being a different power of the cone size .    to conclude , we have presented an order - by - order classification of jet shape variables for narrow jets with massless constituents . at the first few orders we encountered familiar variables  jet mass , angularity , and planar flow  and at higher orders we found new observables .",
    "specifically , we proposed several new observables that may be used to characterize 3- and 4-particle jets . while the classification is complete , the formalism we introduced does not provide much insight into the geometric nature of the observables ( beyond a few simple properties ) , and for that we need additional tools . expanding the energy distribution in terms of zernike polynomials seems especially suited for this purpose , at least for the set of observables analyzed here .",
    "it will be interesting to analyze other observables in this way , and in particular the techniques used for studying @xmath111 can be easily applied to other observables that involve the moments @xmath122 . a more thorough study of the properties of these new observables , and the identification of processes for which they provide discriminating power , is an important topic left to future study .",
    "the fact that the zernike polynomials , which are commonly used in the field of optics , arise naturally in our jet shape analysis is obviously related to the fact that in both cases one is describing some distribution on a disc .",
    "one may hope however that the analogy between optics and jet substructure is deeper .",
    "if that is the case , further insight into the description of jet energy flow may be gained from the well - studied theory of aberrations .",

    "<S> we classify the leading variables that characterize jets with up to 4 particles . </S>",
    "<S> we rediscover the familiar jet mass , angularities , and planar flow , which dominate the lowest order substructure variables . </S>",
    "<S> we also discover several new observables and we briefly discuss their physical interpretation .    </S>",
