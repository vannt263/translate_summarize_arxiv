    "stark hamiltonians play a central role in several fields of physics , including quantum mechanics , condensed matter physics and optics @xcite . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics ,",
    "the simplest case is that of a quantum particle subjected to a constant force @xmath1 , which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where the first term of the right hand side of eq.(1 ) , @xmath3 , is the kinetic energy operator , the second term is the potential of the external force , and @xmath4 is the momentum operator .",
    "as is well known ( see e.g. chap.8.1 of ref.@xcite or ref.@xcite ) the spectrum of @xmath0 is purely absolutely continuous with a set of ( improper ) eigenfunctions given by shifted ary functions . like in the classical limit , a quantum wave packet undergoes a uniformly accelerated motion but spreads owing to quantum diffusion .",
    "indeed , after a change of reference frame ( from th rest frame to an accelerated one ) and a gauge transformation of the wave function the stark hamiltonian ( 1 ) is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a freely moving particle , i.e. with @xmath5 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a much richer and physically relevant dynamics arises when a periodic potential is added to the external force , i.e. for the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the periodic potential with period @xmath8 .",
    "such a problem was originally studied by bloch , zener and wannier in a series of seminal papers in connection with the motion of an electron in a crystal subjected to a uniform electric field @xcite . under the assumption that a single lattice band is excited and the force is weak to neglect tunneling into other bands of the crystal ( zener tunneling )",
    ", the quantum motion of the electron can be described by an effective single - band wannier - stark hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "remarkably , owing to bragg scattering in the lattice a quantum wave packet in the crystal undergoes an oscillatory ( rather than uniformly accelerated ) motion with period @xmath9 , the famous bloch oscillations ( bos ) .",
    "while in natural crystals electronic bos have never been observed owing to dephasing and many - body effects , bos have been impressively demonstrated in a number of experiments after the advent of semiconductor superlattices as terahertz radiation emitted from coherently oscillating electrons @xcite .",
    "quantum and classical analogues of bos have been also proposed and observed in a wide variety of different physical systems , such as in ultracold atoms and bose- einstein condensates @xcite , optical waveguide arrays @xcite , photonic @xcite and acoustic @xcite superlattices , metamaterials @xcite , plasmonic systems @xcite , and quantum liquids @xcite to mention a few .",
    "there is a very extended literature on bos and their applications .",
    "several authors have investigated bos in presence of lattice disorder and inhomogeneities @xcite , particle interaction and correlation @xcite , inhomogeneous fields @xcite , complex potentials @xcite , time - dependent forces @xcite , bos of non - classical states of light @xcite , etc . as far as applications is concerned ,",
    "bos have been used as a tool to explore topological properties of band structures @xcite , to make precision measurements of gravity @xcite , and to realize beam splitters for matter waves @xcite .    in this work",
    "we introduce an exactly - solvable generalized wannier - stark hamiltonian in which the dynamics of a quantum wave packet shows a behavior intermediate between the uniform acceleration of hamiltonian ( 1 ) and the oscillatory bo dynamics of hamiltonian ( 2 ) .",
    "namely , an oscillatory dynamics is superimposed to a parabolic motion , an effect that will be referred to as _ accelerated bloch oscillations_. the generalized wannier - stark hamiltonian considered in this work has the form@xmath10 where @xmath11 is a periodic function of @xmath12 with period @xmath13 and zero mean .",
    "it differs from eq.(1 ) because of the additional term @xmath14 to the free - particle kinetic energy operator .",
    "a possible physical implementation of such an hamiltonian has been recently introduced in optics ref.@xcite , where transverse light dynamics in a self - imaging optical cavity is described by an hamiltonian of the form described by eq.(1 ) . in ref.@xcite , the limiting case @xmath15 was mainly investigated , corresponding to pseudo - periodic bos dynamics and absence of quantum diffusion . here",
    "we consider the more general case @xmath16 and derive analytical expressions of the spectrum , eigenfunctions and propagator of the hamiltonian ( 3 ) .",
    "in particular , we prove rigorously that for @xmath16 the new phenomenon of _ accelerated bloch oscillations _ arises : an oscillatory motion with period @xmath17 , i.e. analogous to bos , is superimposed to the freely - accelerating motion of the wave packet ( as if @xmath18 in ( 3 ) ) .",
    "such a result holds for any normalizable wave packet , but can be violated for an initial non - normalizable probability distribution .",
    "interestingly , for an initial condition corresponding to a ( non - normalizable ) airy wave packet , eigenfunction of ( 1 ) , a periodic oscillatory dynamics without acceleration is found , a phenomenon that can be referred to as _ airy - bloch oscillations_.",

    "since the wave packet defined by eq.(34 ) is normalizable , its center of mass undergoes an oscillatory and ( on average ) accelerated motion ; however , for a sufficiently large values of @xmath119 the airy - bloch breathing dynamics of fig.4(a ) can be observed in the earlier bo cycles , as shown in fig.4(b - d ) .",
    "after a few bo cycles , the periodicity is lost according to the analysis of sec.3.2 .",
