    "among the several methods for treating disordered systems and geometrical problems , percolation theory is certainly one of the most important . due to its similarities with transitions that occur in many other systems ( not only physical , but biological , social etc . ) , percolation has been used in studies within a large variety of fields .",
    "forest fires @xcite , biological evolution @xcite , epidemics @xcite , social influence @xcite and dilute magnetism @xcite are only a few examples of the wide applicability of this theory , as well as percolation ( e.g. , in porous media ) itself @xcite .",
    "although easily defined , percolation presents theoretical and computational difficulties .",
    "for instance , the percolation threshold for the site problem on a simple square lattice is not known exactly .",
    "therefore , approximate solutions are necessary , and much effort has been dedicated in this direction . from the theoretical point of view , one can utilize mean - field @xcite and renormalization group @xcite techniques , among others .",
    "in particular , computer simulations constitute a powerful tool in this area , since their application to percolation is simpler than for many other problems in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "typically , one can obtain a valid configuration by simply populating sites ( or bonds ) in a given lattice . to measure quantities of interest , such as the percolation threshold or the mean cluster size , it is necessary to identify all clusters in the configuration .",
    "for this purpose , many algorithms have been developed , the best known perhaps being that devised by hoshen and kopelman @xcite . other algorithms , like hull - generation @xcite , can also be used , but only to answer some specific questions .",
    "more recently , newman and ziff proposed a new algorithm @xcite , which is general and quite efficient , both in its computational requirements and in its accuracy .",
    "although the algorithm can be used to obtain any observable of the problem , in their papers they have used it to calculate the so - called wrapping probabilities to investigate a number of aspects of the problem .",
    "for example , using exact values of the wrapping probabilities , a high - precision result for the site percolation threshold on the square lattice was obtained @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for most lattices , one does not know the exact wrapping probabilities and , in using them , the problem must be tackled in a different way .",
    "one of the wrapping probabilities - @xmath0 , which is the probability that a cluster wraps around one specified axis , but not around the other ones - is particularly useful . in this case",
    "it is not necessary to know its exact value at the critical concentration for the infinite system since it has a maximum from which the critical point can be obtained .",
    "the method , however , is indeed capable to properly estimate the other wrapping probabilities which do not exhibit a maximum ( in such cases there is just a crossing region close to the critical threshold ) . on the other hand , as we will see below , there are still some probabilities in dimensions higher than two that present , besides the maximum , a crossing region from where critical behavior is also achieved .    in this work",
    "we compute the percolation threshold and the correlation length exponent , as well as the set of the unknown wrapping probabilities using the newman - ziff algorithm .",
    "these quantities are evaluated by employing the usual finite - size scaling as well as a cell - to - cell scheme@xcite . after summarizing the newman - ziff approach in the next section",
    "we describe , in section iii , the method which enables us to evaluate such geometrical quantities and we apply it to site and bond percolation on the square , simple cubic , hcp ( hexagonal close - packed ) and simple hexagonal lattices .",
    "concluding remarks are given in the final section .",
    "to determine the percolation transition , this algorithm uses the wrapping probability @xmath1 , which , for a given site ( or bond ) occupation @xmath2 , is basically the probability that a cluster wraps around a system with periodic boundary conditions on a lattice of linear dimension @xmath3 .",
    "this wrapping can , however , be defined in various manners , each with its own probability .",
    "for instance , on two - dimensional lattices one has : ( i ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the probabilities that a cluster wraps around the system in the horizontal or vertical direction , respectively ( on a square lattice these quantities are equal ) ; ( ii ) @xmath6 , the probability that the cluster wraps around the lattice @xmath7 horizontally @xmath8 vertically ( or both ) ; ( iii ) @xmath9 for wrapping in @xmath10 horizontal @xmath11 vertical directions ; ( iv ) @xmath0 for wrapping around @xmath12 specified direction but @xmath13 the other one .",
    "different lattices can allow for further geometrical choices for @xmath1 .",
    "for example , on a simple cubic lattice , besides @xmath0 , we can define @xmath14 as the probability that there exists a cluster that wraps the system in two directions , but not around the third one .",
    "analogously to @xmath9 , we have @xmath15 for wrapping around the three directions .    in order to evaluate these quantities",
    "it is necessary to generate many independent realizations of the algorithm , each of them consisting of the following steps : + ( 1 ) initially , all sites are empty ; + ( 2 ) sites are chosen to be occupied at random ; + ( 3 ) when a new site is added , one must check all its neighbors to verify if the new site forms an isolated cluster ( all neighbors empty ) or if it joins together two or more clusters . in the first case ,",
    "we need do nothing . in the latter",
    ", we have to update the cluster listing .",
    "clusters are stored in a tree structure , with one site of each cluster considered the @xmath16 site .",
    "all sites in a given cluster , other than the root , have a pointer to some other site in the same cluster , such that by following a succession of such pointers one can ultimately reach the root . in order to join two clusters",
    "we simply add a pointer from the root of the smaller cluster to the root of the larger one ; + ( 4 ) each time step ( 3 ) is repeated , we evaluate the quantities of interest @xmath17 as a function of the number @xmath18 of occupied sites . @xmath17",
    "may be any of the wrapping probabilities @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the number of occupied sites for which percolation first occurs in a given realization .",
    "@xmath17 represents the fraction of realizations in which @xmath20 is less than or equal to @xmath18 . using all @xmath17 s so evaluated , it is possible to calculate the function @xmath21 for all possible values of @xmath2 in the range between @xmath22 and @xmath23 by a convolution with the binomial distribution @xcite : @xmath24 for the bond percolation problem , we just replace sites by bonds in the above steps .",
    "the evaluation of the statistical errors can be done in a conventional fashion .",
    "as discussed in reference @xcite the standard deviation of the binomial distribution ( [ qp ] ) is given by @xmath25}\\over { mcs}}~,\\label{erro}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 in the above equation has been taken as the mean value of the corresponding wrapping probability and @xmath26 is the number of monte carlo steps per site .    as an illustration",
    ", we show in fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) the wrapping probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath0 as a function of the concentration @xmath2 of occupied sites for square lattices of different sizes .",
    "the exact values @xmath27 of these quantities for an infinite square system were derived by pinson @xcite and ziff @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been used these exact values to obtain an estimate for the percolation threshold @xmath28 . for each system size",
    "@xmath3 , one determines the @xmath2 value yielding a wrapping probability equal to exact critical value .",
    "this @xmath2 value provides the estimate of @xmath29 for that @xmath3 . in the critical region",
    ", one knows that the estimates @xmath29 converge to the threshold @xmath28 according to    wrapping probabilities @xmath19 as a function of occupation probability for site percolation on : square lattices ( a ) @xmath4 and ( b ) @xmath0 ; and hexagonal lattices ( c ) @xmath30 and ( d ) @xmath0 . for the square lattice",
    "the data have been obtained by taking @xmath31 mcs and lattice sizes _ l _ = 32 , 48 , 64 , 96 , 128 . for the hexagonal lattice",
    "the data have been obtained by taking @xmath32 mcs and lattice sizes _ l _ = 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 . in all figures",
    "the error bars were omitted for a better visualization .",
    "vertical dashed lines represent the lowest and the greatest values of @xmath2 we have utilized for evaluating wrapping probabilities . , width=298 ]    @xmath33    for square systems , using the known value @xmath34 of the exponent @xmath35 and @xmath36 , as obtained in @xcite , we have @xmath37 . by a finite size",
    "scaling , newman and ziff obtained @xmath38 for the infinite system .",
    "this procedure is more complicated in higher dimensions .",
    "since neither @xmath39 nor @xmath35 are known , one has to vary the scaling exponent to obtain a straight line . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that the estimates of the percolation threshold for a simple cubic lattice scale as @xmath40 .",
    "thus , it seems to be not so easy to determine @xmath35 and @xmath39 separately by this method .",
    "one has to note ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) that @xmath0 is different from the other probabilities , as it exhibits a maximum . in this case",
    ", @xmath29 can be estimated from the position of this maximum .",
    "@xmath0 is then of particular utility in systems for which the exact values are not known .",
    "we will see , moreover , that all the other wrapping probabilities can also be used to estimate the percolation threshold , as well as the correlation length critical exponent , on any lattice .",
    "there are , in addition , some quantities like @xmath14 in three dimensions which exhibit both a maximum and a crossing region .",
    "we have applied the newman - ziff algorithm to site percolation on the two - dimensional ( @xmath41 ) square , the three - dimensional simple hexagonal and simple cubic ( @xmath42 ) lattices , and to bond percolation on square ( 2@xmath43 ) , simple cubic and hcp ( hexagonal close - packed ) lattices .",
    "table [ tab1 ] gives the system and sample sizes used in our study .    before discussing the results ,",
    "we analyze the standard deviation of some particular quantities . fig .",
    "[ fig1.5 ] shows the relative error of @xmath5 for the square lattice and @xmath30 for the hexagonal lattice as a function of the @xmath3 , at the critical concentration .",
    "apart from a strong dependence with small @xmath3 , we clearly see that for larger lattice sizes the relative error is almost independent of @xmath3 , as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ erro ] ) and previously stressed by newman and ziff @xcite , even for the three - dimensional hexagonal lattice .",
    "similar behavior is found for other wrapping probabilities , other three - dimensional lattices , as well as for the bond problem in different lattice structures .",

    "[ fig1](a ) one sees that the derivative of @xmath4 at the critical concentration increases as the lattice size increases .",
    "in fact , one expects that the maximum derivative of any wrapping probability not exhibiting a maximum scales as @xcite @xmath46 thus , the critical exponent @xmath35 can be estimated without any consideration of the critical concentration @xmath28 by taking the scaling behavior of the derivatives of the thermodynamic quantities @xmath19 .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath51 ; @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "combining these four estimates we obtain @xmath54 , in very good agreement with the exact result @xmath34 .",

    "[ fig3 ] illustrates the approach for evaluating the critical concentration , as well as the wrapping probabilities at @xmath28 , applied again to the site percolation problem on the square lattice , through a cell - to - cell estimate . for a fixed probability occupation @xmath2 ,",

    "error bars are smaller than the symbol sizes .",
    ", width=275 ]    exactly at @xmath28 one expects the wrapping probability to be independent of system size .",
    "thus , by varying @xmath2 in the critical region and searching for a constant @xmath5 we obtain an estimate for @xmath28 .",
    "the vertical dashed lines in fig . [ fig1](a ) represent the limits on the @xmath2 values studied . from the data for @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we have then @xmath61 and @xmath60 . combining this estimate with the ones coming from the other quantities we obtain the values listed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the results are quite close to the exact or expected ones , despite the small systems ( sizes up to @xmath62 ) and short runs ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "table [ tab2 ] also gives the results obtained from the present procedure to the bond percolation problem ( which is easily implemented in the algorithm ) with an excellent estimate of the known critical concentration .",
    "moreover , the wrapping probabilities , within the error bars , are the same for site and bond problems , confirming the universal character of these quantities .    having demonstrated the good performance of the method in cases where exact results are available , we studied some three - dimensional lattices where data are not so ubiquitous in the literature .",
    "in particular , we treat the simple cubic , simple hexagonal and the hcp ( hexagonal close - packed ) lattices . to our knowledge",
    ", there are no results available for the wrapping probabilities on such geometries as well as no indication of their universal aspect regarding site and bond dilution .    as an example",
    ", we show in fig . [ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](d ) the wrapping probabilities @xmath30 and @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 for various lattice sizes , for site percolation on the simple hexagonal lattice .",

    "one can clearly see that the wrapping probabilities are distinct for different geometries , as is the critical concentration .",
    "not only are our @xmath28 estimate comparable to the values obtained previously , but the critical exponents found here are close to the expected result for this universality class , namely @xmath63 from series @xcite , @xmath64@xcite , @xmath65@xcite and @xmath66@xcite from monte carlo simulations .    wrapping probability @xmath30 as a function of the lattice size @xmath3 for site percolation on hexagonal lattices .",

    "this is in quite good agreement with the expected universal aspect previously obtained for the spanning probability in general dimensions and with both free and periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of the three - dimensional lattices is the behavior of the quantity @xmath69 giving the probability of wrapping around two directions and not around the third direction .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows such behavior for the simple cubic site diluted problem . in this case one can obtain an estimate of the critical concentration not only from the position of its maximum but also from the crossings at @xmath28",
    "it is noted , however , that a more accurate value is achieved from the analysis of the crossings ( as done in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) than from the location of its maximum .",
    "the same behavior occurs for the other lattice structures .",
    "wrapping probability @xmath69 as a function of @xmath2 for the site percolation on the simple cubic lattice .",

    "we have seen that the results obtained using the present method are in good agreement with the exact ( when available ) or expected ones . it is important to note that this procedure has been implemented using relatively small systems and short monte carlo runs ;",
    "better results could be achieved in larger - scale simulations .",
    "in addition , from the computed wrapping probabilities at @xmath28 for the square and simple cubic lattices one can also confirm their universal aspect regarding site and bond dilution .",
    "the same should hold , of course , for the other lattice geometries .    a slightly modified version of the present procedure , not using the cell - to - cell estimate ,",
    "can also be applied to problems on two - dimensional lattices .",
    "instead of tuning @xmath2 , one can tune one of the @xmath19 in the critical region . for a given quantity @xmath19 ( say , for example @xmath4 ) we fix it at a specified value @xmath72 on the vicinity of the critical point , and proceed analogously to newman and ziff s original approach .",
    "observe that @xmath72 is in this case a first estimate for @xmath27 .",
    "one can then compute , for each @xmath3 , the intercept between the function @xmath1 , previously evaluated , with the fixed @xmath72 .",
    "each of these intercepts gives an estimate for @xmath29 , which is expected , for two - dimensional systems , to scale as @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , plotting @xmath75 for different values of @xmath72 , we can estimate the true @xmath76 as well as the percolation threshold by looking for the value of @xmath72 that yields the best straight line .",
    "table [ tab2 ] reports the critical values so obtained for the two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the results are quite good and comparable to those obtained in the previous section for both the wrapping probabilities and the critical concentration . however , the errors are in general considerably larger . in three dimensions this procedure",
    "can be implemented only if we know the exponent @xmath77 beforehand .",
