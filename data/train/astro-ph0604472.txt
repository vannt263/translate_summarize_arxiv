    "understanding the physics of type ia supernova ( sn ia ) explosions is one of the most important issues of contemporary astrophysics , given the role sne ia play as distance indicators for cosmology and as main producers of heavy elements in the universe .",
    "one of the keys to enter the secrets of snia explosions is to study their diversity .",
    "sne ia are thought to be the thermonuclear explosion of carbon  oxygen white dwarfs driven to ignition conditions by accretion in a binary system .",
    "since explosive burning of the co mixture occurs when the white dwarf s mass is close to the chandrasekhar limit , it has long been speculated that sne  ia should be good candidates for standard candles .",
    "while earlier impressions were that sne ia are quite homogeneous , it was later noted that there are intrinsic differences among them .",
    "however , correlations have been found that describe sne ia as a one - parameter family .",
    "@xcite measured the decline in @xmath2-band magnitude from @xmath2-band maximum to 15 d later , a quantity he called @xmath0 , and found that brighter objects have a smaller decline rate than dimmer ones .",
    "the decline rate therefore not only is useful for arranging sne ia in a ` photometric ' one - parameter sequence , but should also reflect , although possibly in a gross way , sn ia physics .",
    "this is matched by a spectroscopic sequence @xcite , defined by @xmath3(si  ii ) , the ratio of the depth of two absorptions at 5800 and 6100 , both of which are usually attributed to si  ii  lines .",
    "this ratio correlates with the absolute magnitude of sne  ia and , in turn , with the rate of decline .",
    "spectroscopic models suggest that most spectral differences are due to variations in the effective temperature . in the context of chandrasekhar - mass explosions ,",
    "these variations can be interpreted in terms of a variation in the mass of @xmath4ni produced in the explosion .",
    "the relative behaviour of the two si  ii  lines is , however , counterintuitive , and still lacks a thorough theoretical explanation .",
    "garnavich et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that the bluer line is affected by ti  ii  lines for objects with @xmath5 , but this is not supported by detailed spectral synthesis studies of sn  1991bg and sn  2002bo ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although a one - parameter description of sne ia has proved to be very useful , it does not completely account for the observational diversity of sne ia ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , earlier studies ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the photospheric expansion velocity , which can be taken as a proxy for the kinetic energy release in the explosion , correlates with neither @xmath0 nor @xmath6(si  ii ) [ see also @xcite for an early attempt to correlate snia observables ] .",
    "however , @xcite found a spread in the time - averaged rate of decrease of the expansion velocity of the si  ii  6355-   absorption after maximum , which might suggest another means of classifying sne ia .",
    "they used @xmath7 among other parameters to perform a computer - based hierarchical cluster analysis of a sample of 26 sne ia .",
    "this led to a partitioning of the sne into three groups , called , respectively , high velocity gradient ( hvg ; @xmath8 km@xmath9s@xmath10d@xmath11 ) , low velocity gradient ( lvg ; @xmath12 km@xmath9s@xmath10d@xmath11 ) , and faint .",
    "the faint group includes sne that are intrinsically dim , on average @xmath13 mag fainter than sne belonging to the other two groups .",
    "their velocity gradient is large , @xmath14 km@xmath9s@xmath10d@xmath11 .",
    "hvg and lvg sne have similar mean absolute blue magnitude at maximum , but the hvg sne have a smaller spread in @xmath0 , and all sne  ia with @xmath15 are lvgs .",
    "@xcite confirmed the relation between @xmath1(si  ii ) and @xmath0 , but find a larger scatter among lvg sne , especially at the bright end .",
    "spectra are an invaluable source of information , on both kinematics and the chemical composition of the ejecta . while other studies aim at extracting information by reproducing spectra or line ratios with models ( stehle et al .",
    "2005 ; bongard et al . 2005 ) , this work is based on direct measurements of spectroscopic data , providing therefore a complementary approach [ see also @xcite , who emphasized the time evolution ] .",
    "we focus on a comparison of the spectral properties of different sne .",
    "this requires a large enough number of objects with spectral data of good quality and at comparable epochs of evolution . during the last few years",
    ", the number of such objects has increased tremendously .",
    "this work is thus based upon a collection of published as well as unpublished spectral data for 28 sne ia , 25 of which are from @xcite .",
    "the expansion velocities of some clearly defined featues were measured systematically and consistently , as were their equivalent widths ( ews , see section [ sec : ewmeasurementtechnique ] ) . with the aim of gathering information about the differences in chemical composition , we studied a number of line strength ratios , involving lines of intermediate mass elements ( ime ) such as s or si as well as lines of fe group elements .",
    "thus , our study should explore the extent of nuclear burning in different objects .",
    "it also turned out to be interesting to look at ratios involving a line of oxygen as representative of unburned or partially burned material . taking into account seven different lines",
    ", this paper aims to extend the studies cited above .",
    "measurements were performed for different objects at comparable epochs of evolution , so that values can be contrasted , differences examined and links to the physical properties of the objects identified .",
    "one possible approach is to examine the relation between line velocities and strenghts on the one hand and the light curve decline rate on the other .",
    "we used the sample of sne from @xcite , except for one object ( 1999cw ) for which there was no spectum at a suitable epoch ( see below ) .",
    "three new objects ( 1991 m , 2004eo , 2005bl ) were added ; the sample was divided into the three groups defined in @xcite .",
    "an overview of the objects , group assignment , @xmath0 and @xmath7 values , and the sources of the respective spectra is given in table [ tab : objtable ] .",
    "these data are taken from @xcite  see also references therein  except for additional / updated objects ( see table notes ) , for which they were newly calculated .    for our measurements , we selected from our database about 100 spectra containing at least one absorption that can be clearly identified .    in a sn ia spectrum near maximum , several such features can be seen ; table [ tab : featuretable ] lists the lines used for this study .",
    "the ew ratios considered are given in table [ tab : ratiotable ] .",
    "for an overview of features , see fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "starting from the blue end , a feature typical for sne ia shows up around @xmath16 which is due to the ca  ii  h&k lines .",
    "this feature is , however , not evaluated in this study because the spectra of some objects do not extend far enough to the blue to include that feature .",
    "the first two features evaluated , viewed from the blue , are troughs ( i.e. unresolved blends of many lines ) mostly related to fe lines .",
    "the bluer one is centered around @xmath17  in the observed spectra , and is made not only of fe  ii  and fe  iii   lines , but has also contributions from mg  ii for the fainter sne and  for very faint objects  strong ti  ii  lines .",
    "the other trough is centered around @xmath18  in the spectra and contains lines of fe  ii  and fe  iii  with almost no contamination by other elements except some si  ii  lines .",
    "both features are frequently accompanied by small ` notches ' at their edges .",
    "these are weaker features that are not necessarily caused by fe lines .",
    "the determination of the edges of the troughs is therefore difficult ; special care was taken that this was done in a consistent way for all objects .",
    "even then , measurements of the @xmath19-  trough for the faintest objects can not be compared with the rest ; the appearance of ti  iilines affects not only the depth of the trough but also its blue extent .",
    "also , measurements for 1991t - like objects should be taken with some care because of the fe  iii  lines dominating the feature before maximum light ( see @xcite ) .",
    "lines related to the ime ions s  ii  and si  ii  are perhaps the most characteristic features of sn ia spectra .",
    "s  ii  absorption causes a w - shaped trough with observed minima at @xmath20 and 5400 , respectively .",
    "the minima can be attributed to s  ii  multiplets with their strongest lines at @xmath21 and 5640 , respectively .",
    "all those transitions originate from relatively high - lying lower levels , which causes a significant weakening of the s  iiabsorption at low temperatures .",
    "si  ii  features , on the other hand , can be seen at @xmath22 and 6100 .",
    "both features are blends , with average rest wavelength 5972 and 6355 , respectively .",
    "the redder line is by far the stronger , and its temperature dependence is rather weak . on the other hand ,",
    "the strength of the 5972-  absorption is strongly correlated with temperature , but the correlation is opposite to intuitive expectations from atomic physics ( see also section [ sec : ew_si5972 ] ) .",
    "an explanation might involve the presence of other , weaker lines .    in the spectra of almost all sne ,",
    "another feature is visible around @xmath23  near maximum light , which is a blend of two very close o  i  lines with a mean rest wavelength of 7773 .",
    "the absorption is especially prominent in spectra of faint sne .",
    "unfortunately , the feature suffers from contamination by the telluric absorption at @xmath24  ( and sometimes perhaps also by mg  ii   lines ) , which makes measurements complicated ( see section [ sec : ewmeasurementtechnique ] ) .",
    "all measurements were carried out using iraf ( see acknowledgments ) .",
    "the spectra were deredshifted ; @xmath25 values were taken from wavelength measurements of interstellar na  i  d and ca  ii  h&k lines , or  if this was uncertain  from either the literature if any was available or from the leda or ned catalogues ( using galaxy recession velocities ) .",
    "no reddening correction was applied to the spectra . as discussed below ,",
    "reddening should have negligible impact on the measured values .",
    "the spectral data do not cover the same epochs for all objects . in order to include as many sne as possible , we interpolated / extrapolated ew and velocity values at @xmath26 for each object by performing a least - squares fit of the measured values at different times ( this also yields standard deviations used as statistical error estimates ) . since the features can be assumed to evolve linearly in a limited interval of time , we evaluated spectra from 5 to + 5  d relative to @xmath2 maximum . in cases where only one or two",
    "spectra were available in this range , additional spectra from epochs between 8 and + 6.5  d were used if available ( for measurements of the si  ii  @xmath27 ew and velocity , and of the s  ii  ew , the upper limit was + 5  d in all cases , as these values evolve rapidly at later times for some objects ) .",
    "after this selection , some objects remained with only one or two spectra available ; this required a special evaluation procedure . in cases with two spectra",
    ", the error can not be computed from the regression ; it was therefore calculated by propagating the errors of the single measurements , where @xmath28 is the value at @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the coordinates of the two given data points . ] instead . in cases with only one spectrum ,",
    "the value from this spectrum is given in the diagrams , if it can be expected that the evolution between the date of @xmath2 maximum and that of the spectrum is not too rapid .",
    "the error was then calculated by adding to the error of measurement ( see below ) an estimate for the error in the estimated time .",
    "the latter was computed as the average slope of the regression lines for objects belonging to the same sn group ( with @xmath31 spectra available ) , multiplied by the time offset of the single spectrum relative to the day of @xmath2 maximum .    for the sne 1984a and 2002dj ew measurements ,",
    "the described procedure is not reasonable , as the spectral coverage is sparse around @xmath2 maximum , and the observations of these two objects show a particularly pronounced non - linear time evolution for many ews .",
    "the ew values and respective uncertainties were thus obtained by performing a quadratic polynomial fit to all available data between 10 and + 10  d relative to @xmath2 maximum .",
    "ratios were calculated from the @xmath32 values obtained as described ; the errors attached to the ratios were computed by propagating the errors of the ews quadratically .",
    "the mean expansion velocity of a given line was determined from the blueshift of the absorption relative to the rest wavelength .",
    "the velocity thus derived is physically meaningful only for single lines or for close multiplets that are sufficiently isolated from other strong features .",
    "since most lines have a p cygni shape and are blends , one has to think thoroughly about how to measure the ` mean ' wavelength of an absorption .",
    "we used two different methods : the first is to use the gaussian fit routine within iraf ; the second is to estimate the centre of the absorption by eye ( taking into account problems such as the sloping continuum ) .",
    "the values obtained from several such measurements were then averaged ; the respective standard deviation is a crude estimate of the error introduced by the manual measurements , and was used to calculate the error in the cases mentioned above .",
    "[ messungillustration ] shows an example of how measurements were performed .      as a measure of line strength ,",
    "we take the equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "this is defined as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the flux density level in the spectrum and @xmath35 the continuum flux density .",
    "ew is insensitive to multiplication of the flux density spectrum by a constant between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are not too far away from each other , reddening effects can be neglected .",
    "other ` multiplicative errors ' are also suppressed .",
    "the ew of an absorption ( or an emission ) line can be measured inside iraf ( when showing spectra by splot ) by entering the beginning and ending wavelengths of the line , as well as the continuum level at those wavelengths .",
    "the main difficulty is to define the continuum and the starting and ending points for a feature , especially considering that the lines have p cygni profiles .",
    "we proceeded as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ messungillustration ] ) :    since a ` real ' continuum level can not be determined in sn ia spectra owing to the multitude of line absorptions , for a single p cygni profile we defined a pseudo - continuum level to be the flux density level near the edges of the feature , neglecting the influence the emission component has on this .",
    "the edges of a feature were set roughly where the slope of the flux curve equals the slope of an imaginary pseudo - continuum curve joining the opposite sides of the line .",
    "the error involved with this procedure has no effect on the comparative study as long as all measurements are done consistently .",
    "some lines and absorption troughs regularly have poorly determinable or jagged edges . in these cases",
    ", care was taken that the measurements were done as homogeneously as possible for all objects .",
    "ew measurements were carried out several times ( see fig .",
    "[ messungillustration ] ) , taking into account reasonable upper and lower estimates of the continuum level and the starting and ending points .",
    "the standard deviations thereby obtained for the ew values is again a rough estimate of the errors introduced by the manual input of beginning / ending points and the continuum level , and was further evaluated in the above - mentioned cases .",
    "the o  i  @xmath38 line requires special attention . in most spectra ,",
    "it is contaminated by an atmospheric absorption that is not completely removed in the reduction process . in these cases , the atmospheric absorption or its residuals were cut by visual judgement before measuring the ew , and the measurements were carried out eliminating the contamination in different ways , so that the resulting standard deviation roughly represents the error introduced by the snipping process .",
    "we only measured the velocities of features that comply with the requirements above , namely features that are due to a single ion , since single lines are not available .",
    "the lines discussed below are si  ii  @xmath39 , and s  ii   @xmath40 . minimum . ] measured values are listed in table [ tab : velocityvaluetable ] .",
    "the velocities at maximum derived from this line show a big scatter especially at lower @xmath42 values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v_si6355 ] ) .",
    "however , once the sne are divided into velocity gradient groups , it turns out that most sne , covering a wide range of @xmath42 , from 0.9 to @xmath43 , and including all lvg , some hvg , and the brightest among the faint sne , have a roughly constant @xmath44(si  ii  @xmath41 ) , with only a small scatter ( @xmath45 km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "hvg objects have a wide range of @xmath44(si  ii  @xmath41 ) values , with no correlation with @xmath42 , and are responsible for most of the scatter . for faint sne , @xmath44(si  ii  @xmath41 )",
    "goes from values comparable to those of the lvg group at @xmath46@xmath47 to smaller values as @xmath42 increases .      although the velocities of this line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v_si5972 ] ) show the same overall tendencies as those derived from the @xmath41 feature , there are differences especially among the hvg objects .",
    "they reach lower maximum velocities , leading to a smaller spread inside this group . a slight tendency to lower values ( by @xmath48 km  s@xmath11 )",
    "can also be noted in every group .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the line is weaker and thus forms deeper than si  ii@xmath41 .",
    "the apparently larger scatter among lvg objects may be due to the fact that the weak feature often shows a more complicated shape and suffers from noise , making measurements of the centroid less reliable .",
    "also , contamination from other lines may occur .",
    "this s  ii  absorption ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v_s5640 ] ) has a behaviour similar to that of the si  ii  absorptions discussed above .",
    "however , it shows significantly lover velocities than the si  ii  @xmath41 feature , as can be expected since the line is much weaker ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the mean differences from the values derived from the si  ii  line for the respective groups are as follows : hvg : @xmath49@xmath50 km  s@xmath11 ; lvg : @xmath49 km  s@xmath11 ; faint : @xmath51 km  s@xmath11 . the spread of values for the hvgs is much smaller in @xmath44(s  ii ) than in @xmath44(si  ii  @xmath41 ) , and also slightly smaller than that of @xmath44(si  ii  @xmath27 ) .",
    "in this section , the measurements of the individual features are presented and discussed .",
    "values are given in table [ tab : ewvaluetable ] .",
    "the ew of this feature is roughly constant for all sne with @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_fe4300 ] ) .",
    "the lack of evolution suggests that fe dominates this feature , or at least that the relative contribution of fe and mg does not evolve with @xmath42 in the range from 1 to 1.8 .",
    "hvgs tend to have larger ews than lvgs because in general they have broader and deeper lines .",
    "the ew rapidly increases for faint sne , which is the effect of ti  ii  lines becoming very strong in those coolest objects , as was the case for , e.g.  , sn  1991bg @xcite .",
    "the ew of this feature is essentially constant in all sne , with a rather large dispersion among objects with the same decline rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_fe4800 ] ) .",
    "there is a slight trend to increasing values for the fainter sne , possibly an effect of the lower temperature which makes the fe  iilines stronger . on the other hand , some of the peculiar bright sne , such as sn  1991 t , where the fe  iii / fe  ii  ratio is large ( mazzali et  al .",
    "1995 ) , have values comparable to other sne , suggesting that fe  iii  dominates this feature , as well as the fe @xmath52 trough , in all lvgs .",
    "hvg sne have again larger values than lvgs , and now the trend is even clearer",
    ". analogy with the faint sne may suggest that the hvg sne have a lower temperature as a consequence of the higher velocity , but it may also just imply that fe reaches higher velocities in hvgs , as do s and si .",
    "sne  1984a and 1983 g have somewhat larger values than the other sne .",
    "this is probably due to the broad - lined nature of these sne , the sne  ia with the highest velocities ever recorded @xcite .",
    "the other high - velocity sn , sn  1997bp , could not be measured since its spectra do not extend to the blue .",
    "there is an apparent tendency for sne to cluster in several small groups .",
    "we refrain from interpreting this as an indication of different modes of the explosion , and defer this to a time when more data are available .      the ew of the s  ii  feature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_s ] ) shows a kind of parabolic trend , with very small scatter .",
    "it has a small value for sne with @xmath56 .",
    "it reaches a broad maximum in all other lvg and most hvg sne with @xmath0@xmath57@xmath58 , and then it progressively declines at @xmath59 . the observed drop may be explained as an effect of the insufficient population of the highly excited lower levels of these lines as the temperatures of the sne drop .",
    "however , at the highest temperatures a reduction in the ime abundance is also required to reproduce the observed weakening of the lines in objects such as sn  1991 t ( mazzali et  al .",
    "therefore , it is possible that a trend of increasing abundance going from the slowest to the intermediate decliners , and then decreasing abundance from there to the fastest decliners is also present .",
    "the hvg sne have a slightly larger value than the lvgs , and sn  1984a again stands out by having an anomalously large value .      the ew of the weaker si  ii  line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_si5972 ] ) correlates very well with @xmath42 , and could therefore be used as a luminosity indicator just as well as the line strength ratios presented below .",
    "this behaviour is at the basis of the observed relation between @xmath6(si  ii ) and sn luminosity @xcite , as is illustrated by a plot of @xmath6(si  ii ) versus ew(si  ii  @xmath27 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nugentcomparison ] ) and by the weaker correlation of ew(si  ii  @xmath41 ) with @xmath42 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ew_si6355 ] ) .",
    "the very existence of the trend is puzzling , since the si  ii  @xmath27 line originates from a rather highly excited level , and its strength may be expected to correlate with temperature directly rather than inversely . the explanation may involve the contribution of lines from other elements and may require full non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) analysis .",
    "hvg sne now blend in with the lvg sne .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , since hvg sne have the highest velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v_si6355 ] ) .",
    "clearly , the line does not become more intense in sne where it gets faster .",
    "this line shows a number of interesting trends ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_si6355 ] ) . for most lvgs ( with @xmath60 )",
    "the ew has a tendency to increase slowly with increasing @xmath42 . at larger decline rates , where the faint sne are",
    ", the value drops again .",
    "the two bright and peculiar lvg sne , 1991 t and 1997br , have much smaller values .",
    "this general behaviour is similar to that of the s  ii  feature , and may be understood as the effect of temperature and possibly of abundance : in sne  1991 t and 1999br the degree of ionisation is higher than in spectroscopically normal objects , and the si  ii  line is accordingly weaker , but a low abundance of the ime is also required to reproduce the observed spectra ( mazzali et  al .",
    "the si  ii  line is strongest for intermediate decliners , where temperature reaches the optimal value for this line and ime abundance possibly reaches a peak .",
    "the line weakens in faint sne , which are cooler and possibly have a smaller ime abundance .",
    "this effect is less marked than it is in the s  ii  feature , since the si  ii@xmath41 originates from levels with a much smaller excitation potential and is less sensitive to temperature .",
    "the observed drop may therefore more directly reflect a change in the abundance of si in near - photospheric mass layers @xmath61 km  s@xmath11 ) of faint sne .",
    "the behaviour of the hvg sne , on the other hand , is extremely different : these sne are located almost vertically on the plot : although they cover a smaller range of @xmath42 values than the lvg sne ( 1.05  1.5 versus 0.9  1.5 ) , their ew(si  ii  @xmath41 ) spans about a factor of two in value .",
    "this may reflect the presence of high - velocity absorption in the si  ii  line @xcite .",
    "sn  1984a is again the most extreme object , followed by sne  1997bp and 1983 g , but these objects appear to be the tip of a smooth distribution .",
    "the distribution of hvgs in ew is similar to that in @xmath44(si  ii@xmath41 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v_si6355 ] ) .",
    "faster lines tend to be broader and deeper . understanding this kind of behaviour",
    "may prove to be a very important step in our effort to understand the systematics of sne  ia .",
    "the ew of this line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_o ] ) tends to rise towards higher @xmath62 , but shows quite a big scatter , especially at the bright end . here , there are both objects which show a very weak o  i  feature around @xmath2 maximum as well as objects exhibiting values @xmath63 .",
    "note that these differences can be found both within the hvg and lvg groups , which cover roughly the same range of measured o  i  ew values",
    ". they may partly be due to the above - mentioned difficulties of measuring the o  i  line .",
    "the overall trend of higher values for fainter objects is probably a temperature effect , but it may also reflect changes in abundance . among faint sne ,",
    "the trend appears to be reversed .",
    "this is possibly due to the decrease of photospheric velocities at the faint end .",
    "in this section we discuss selected ratios of ew .",
    "we focus on ratios that are useful indicators of @xmath42 , and on ratios that bear particular physical significance because they involve elements that are synthesised in different parts of the exploding white dwarf .",
    "the discussed ratio values are given in table [ tab : ratiovaluetable ] .",
    "our measurement is similar to the @xmath6(si  ii ) value of @xcite , but it differs from it since we use the ew .",
    "the ew ratio of the two si  iilines follows the trend found by @xcite of increasing @xmath6(si ii ) with increasing @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_si5972_si6355 ] ) .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , the scatter at the bright end is larger .",
    "as we noted above , the observed behaviour is mainly caused by the unexplained linear increase of the si  ii  @xmath27 line strength for increasing @xmath42 .",
    "the ratio of the ews of these two broad absorption troughs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_fe4300_fe4800 ] ) is fairly constant for @xmath65 . some of the faint sne ( 1991bg , 1999by , and 2005bl ) have much larger values .",
    "the rise at the faint end is clearly due to the appearance of ti  ii  lines in the 4300-  feature at low temperature .",
    "this value correlates very well with @xmath42 for faint objects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_s_si6355 ] ) .",
    "the lvg sne also correlate reasonably well with @xmath62 , with a scatter of @xmath66 per cent , but the hvg sne do not .",
    "the average values of the hvg and the lvg group are very different .",
    "the hvg sne show again an almost vertical behaviour , as they did in both the @xmath44(si  ii  @xmath41 ) and the ew(si  ii  @xmath41 ) plot . since ew(si",
    "ii  @xmath41 ) is affected , the ratio is smaller for these sne . for fainter objects , the behaviour mainly seems to reflect the above - mentioned ( see section [ sec : ew_s ] ) changes of ionization structure with decreasing temperature : the s  ii  line strength decreases rapidly as @xmath42 increases , which is not as much the case for the si line .",
    "this ratio correlates well with @xmath42 for almost all objects , regardless of their group ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_s_si5972 ] ) .",
    "it decreases almost linearly with increasing @xmath42 , and is thus as suitable as @xmath64(si  ii ) as a spectroscopic luminosity indicator .",
    "the trend for a smaller ratio with increasing @xmath42 was already present in the previous ` s / si ' ratio , but here the scatter is much reduced and both lvg and hvg objects follow the correlation , the differences between the two groups being apparently suppressed .",
    "these weaker lines are in fact less affected than si  ii  @xmath41 by the high velocities and the ensuing increased strength , as shown in the ew plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_s ] and [ fig : ew_si5972 ] ) .",
    "even sn  1984a follows the general trend : once ratios are taken its large ew values cancel out .",
    "we can not , however , draw any conclusions about si distribution , velocities , etc . from measurements involving the si  ii@xmath67 feature , because the behaviour of this line is not well understood , as discussed above .      the plot of this ratio ( see fig . [",
    "fig : r_si6355_fe4800 ] ) is very interesting , as is its possible meaning , which is discussed below .",
    "the ratio exhibits a ` quadratic ' behaviour : the values are small at small @xmath42 , they increase until they reach a peak at @xmath69@xmath58 and then they drop again for very faint sne such as 1991bg , 1997cn and 1999by .",
    "the behaviour reflects that of ew(si  ii  @xmath41 ) but is highly enhanced , suggesting that we are seeing more than just the effect of temperature . the hvg sne blend in with the other sne ,",
    "although they have larger values of both ew(si",
    "ii@xmath41 ) and ew(fe @xmath68 ) .",
    "this ratio behaves like the previous one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_s_fe4800 ] ) , as could be expected since both si and s are ime .",
    "the faint sne now reach very small values , presumably because of the higher temperature sensitivity of the s  ii  feature than the si  ii  @xmath41 line .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the behaviour of this ratio and the one above as due not only to temperature , but also to a trend for the brightest sne to have a higher abundance of fe relative to ime in layers near the photosphere at maximum ( @xmath70 km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "this is plausible since fe  ii  and si  ii  have similar ionisation potentials , and should respond similarly to changes in temperature .",
    "the observed behaviour may indicate that bright sne burn more to nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) ( @xmath71 per cent of @xmath4ni   has decayed to @xmath4fe  at the time of maximum ) .",
    "the drop of the ratio at the largest @xmath42 values may then be due to the fact that now the ime abundance is beginning to decrease in the mass layers near @xmath72 , after reaching a peak at @xmath69@xmath58 .",
    "note that @xmath72 is smaller at larger @xmath42 .",
    "this implies a lower opacity , which in turn could be associated with a smaller fe - group abundance relative to ime in the layers between 9000 and 11000 km  s@xmath11 , that is between the photosphere of faint sne and that of the other objects .",
    "this would suggest that the faint sne produce less nse material , as is expected both from their dimness and their narrow light curves .",
    "the difference between faint sne and brighter ones would be in the degree of burning to nse at velocities @xmath73 km  s@xmath11 , as hypothesised in various models ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "burning to ime may also extend to lower velocities in faint sne than in brighter ones .",
    "this ratio , unlike the previous one , shows an almost constantly rising trend . over a large range of @xmath42 values ,",
    "it increases almost linearly with @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_si5972_fe4800 ] ) .",
    "this ratio is suitable as a luminosity indicator .    as for a possible explanation of the observed trend",
    ", it appears that the ratio is driven by the increasing strength of the si  ii  feature with increasing @xmath42 , which is not explained as discussed above .",
    "this ratio was calculated in order to investigate the relation between o and ime abundance . as we showed above , both ew(si  ii  @xmath41 ) and ew(s  ii )",
    "decrease at @xmath74 .",
    "if this implies less burning even to ime in the faintest sne , we might expect o / ime ratios to increase in those objects .",
    "the ratio of o  i  @xmath38 and si  ii  @xmath41 shows indeed a slight trend to rise with @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_o_si6355 ] ) , but this is superimposed by a large spread in values of @xmath75 per cent at almost every @xmath42 value .",
    "note again that the difficulty in measuring the o  i  line may affect our results .",
    "the s  ii  line tracks the photosphere more accurately than si  ii@xmath41 .",
    "this ratio shows tendency to increase with increasing @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_o_s ] ) , which is enhanced for @xmath76 . while the decrease in s  ii  line strength for large @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_fe4800 ] ) certainly drives the latter trend , and the rise in o  i  ew causes the tendency for @xmath77 , how much all of this is due to decreasing ime abundance compared to oxygen is unclear .",
    "this ratio  though exhibiting significant scatter especially at low @xmath62  shows a clear trend to increase for @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_o_fe4800 ] ) .",
    "this can be understood by considering the tendency of the o  i  ew to rise and the behaviour of the fe @xmath68 trough ew , which is essentially flat .",
    "interestingly , for the faintest objects , an almost linear drop can be observed .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the possible implications of the various measurements .      near maximum , all lvg , some hvg and some faint sne have a very similar si  iivelocity , @xmath78 km  s@xmath11  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v_si6355 ] ) . this can be taken to imply that there is significant nuclear burning ( at least to ime ) in all these objects , irrespective of their brightness .",
    "as we know , @xmath42 depends mostly on the amount of nse material synthesised ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , while the kinetic energy ( ke ) depends also on burning to ime @xcite .",
    "therefore , all lvg sne may have a similar ke .",
    "the faintest sne have a lower @xmath44(si  ii@xmath41 ) , @xmath79@xmath80 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that there may be less total burning , not just less burning to nse , and thus possibly less ke , in these sne .    as for hvg sne , it is interesting to check whether the observed high velocity is related to the presence of high - velocity features ( hvfs , * ? ? ?",
    "these are high - velocity absorptions observed mostly in the ca  ii  ir triplet in the spectra of almost all sne  ia earlier than 1 week before maximum .",
    "the high velocities measured for hvgs here may be the result of blending of si  ii  and s  ii  hvfs with the lower velocity photospheric lines .",
    "indeed , si  ii  hvfs are inferred at earlier times in several sne , but never seen detached from the main , photospheric component @xcite .",
    "interestingly , no correlation between pre - maximum hvfs and ime velocity at maximum is found : the six sne that are common to this study and @xcite divide evenly among the hvg ( sne 2002bo , 2002dj , 2002er ) and lvg ( sne 2001el , 2003du , 2003kf ) groups . furthermore , while all these sne have prominent hvfs in the ca  ii  ir triplet about one week before maximum or earlier , it is actually the lvg sne among them that retain strong ca  ii  hvfs at about maximum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 3 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that detached hvfs should behave similarly , whether they occur in ca  ii  or si  ii  ( or s  ii ) .",
    "therefore , the rapid decrease of the hvf strength in hvgs may be behind the rapid drop in the si  ii  velocity , if si  iihvfs are not resolved .",
    "however , this leaves us with an apparent contradiction : on the one hand , the lvg sne have the longer - lasting hvfs , but on the other the hvg sne still have the highest si  ii  velocities at maximum . taken individually ,",
    "both of these behaviours could be understood in the frame of a scenario where hvfs determine the line velocities , but the fact that they occur together is difficult to accommodate .",
    "hvfs may be due to asymmetries in the ejection , or to interaction with circumstellar material , while the velocity at maximum more likely reflects global properties of the explosion .",
    "the s  ii  velocity behaves like the si  ii  velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v_s5640 ] ) . this line is weaker than the si  ii  line , and therefore it is a better tracer of the photosphere .",
    "the s  ii  velocity plot shows that the photosphere moves to progressively lower velocities for increasing @xmath42 .",
    "this is again to be expected , since @xmath72 depends on both density and opacity .",
    "while the density may be the same , the temperature is lower in fainter sne , so @xmath72 may also be lower .",
    "the presence of s at @xmath81 km  s@xmath11  confirms that the @xmath4ni  production is small in the faster decliners .",
    "small values for the faintest sne may also suggest a possibly smaller ke , or even a smaller mass . as for hvgs , they may again be affected by line broadening , although clear s  iihvfs have never been observed .",
    "the effect is indeed smaller than seen in the si  ii  line , but the riddle mentioned above still stands .      besides @xmath64(si  ii )",
    ", two other line strength ratios correlate particularly well with @xmath42 : s  ii  versus si  ii  @xmath27 [ @xmath64(s , si ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : r_s_si5972 ] ] and si  ii  @xmath27 versus fe @xmath68 [ @xmath64(si , fe ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : r_si5972_fe4800 ] ] .",
    "all correlations involve the mysterious si  ii  @xmath27 line , whose ew is at least as well  if not better  correlated with @xmath42 than the ratios , especially at high values of @xmath42 .",
    "parameters of least square fits for the respective functions @xmath82 can be found in table [ tab : leastsquarefittable ] ; the regression lines are also shown in the respective diagrams .",
    "these linear regressions have been calculated over the whole sn ia variety and not only over normal sn ia as in @xcite .",
    "the main difference between hvg and lvg objects , leading to the separation in a hyerarchical cluster analysis , is the velocity development of the si  ii@xmath41 line after maximum .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 seems to be related to the diversity of sne ia beyond the differences described by @xmath42 .",
    "hvg objects with the same @xmath42 exhibit a wide range of ime velocities ( figs [ fig : v_si6355 ] and [ fig : v_s5640 ] ) , ew(si  ii  @xmath41 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_si6355 ] ) , and of the ratio ew(s  ii ) versus  ew(si  ii  @xmath41 ) ( fig . [",
    "fig : r_s_si6355 ] ) . while the spread of velocities could be explained by the presence of ime at different depths in hvgs , the variation in the ratio ew(s  ii)/ew(si  ii  @xmath41 )",
    "is due to the fact that only the si  ii  @xmath41 line has a wide range of ew for the hvg sne .",
    "the line strengths around maximum give the following picture ( si conclusions are always derived from the si  ii  @xmath41 line , as mentioned above ) : brighter objects tend to contain less oxygen at the velocities probed by the spectra near maximum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_o ] ) .",
    "intermediate decliners contain more silicon and less fe than slow decliners ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_si6355_fe4800 ] ) .",
    "thus , the photosphere at maximum is deeper in the fe layer for the slow decliners , while it still inside the si layer for the intermediate decliners .",
    "however , @xmath72 for these two groups is practically the same , at least within lvg objects , as shown by the @xmath44(si ) and @xmath44(s ) plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v_si6355 ] and [ fig : v_s5640 ] ) .",
    "this implies that burning to nse extends to outer layers in the slow decliners .",
    "very faint objects contain more unburned or partially burned material ( i.e. oxygen ) , probably at the expense of ime ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this is suggested not only by the ratio ew(o  i@xmath38)/ew(s  ii ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_o_s ] ) , but also by the decline of the equivalent widths of the si  ii  and s  ii  lines ( figs [ fig : ew_si6355 ] and [ fig : ew_s ] ) . since the photosphere , as traced by the s  ii  line , is deeper as @xmath42 increases , this may suggest that the faster decliners have less overall burning .",
    "we have systematically measured the velocities and ew of a number of spectral features in sne  ia around maximum .",
    "the sne have been grouped according to their velocity gradient @xcite , and we examined different ew ratios searching for systematic trends and for possible hints to the general character of sn  ia explosions .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows .",
    "the photospheric velocity , as indicated by si  ii  and s  ii  lines , is approximately constant for all lvg sne with @xmath60 .",
    "the value declines at larger @xmath42 .",
    "hvg sne are found in a limited range of @xmath42 , but their velocities are highly variable .    the ew of the fe - dominated features are approximately constant for all sne .",
    "those of ime lines are highest for @xmath83@xmath58 and are smaller for the brightest and the faintest sne .",
    "hvg sne have on average larger values , in particular for si  ii  @xmath41 .",
    "the o  i  @xmath38 line is particularly strong in the fainter sne , and tends to get weaker with increasing luminosity .",
    "three ew ratios are good indicators of @xmath42 : @xmath84si  ii@xmath85 [ ew(si  ii  @xmath27)/ew(si  ii  @xmath41 ) , similar to @xmath6(si  ii ) in @xcite ] , @xmath86 [ ew(si  ii  @xmath27)/ew(s  ii ) ] , @xmath87 [ ew(si  ii  @xmath27)/ew(fe trough @xmath68 ) ] .",
    "all three ratios are driven by the ew of the si  ii  @xmath27 line , which itself might thus be the best spectroscopic luminosity indicator .",
    "its behaviour and identification are , however , not well understood ; these relations are therefore only empirical",
    ".    the ratios of ew(si  ii  @xmath41 ) and ew(s  ii ) to ew(fe trough @xmath68 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_si6355_fe4800 ] and [ fig : r_s_fe4800 ] ) show a parabolic behaviour : they are small at small @xmath42 , reach a peak at @xmath83@xmath58 , and then decline . while for the s  ii  line part of this behaviour could be explained as the effect of increasing temperature , the si / fe trend may reflect an abundance change .",
    "the brightest sne have more fe near the maximum - light photosphere ( @xmath73 km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "intermediate decliners have more ime and less fe at a similar velocity .",
    "faint sne have a deeper photosphere , indicating both less @xmath4ni  and fe - group elements , and also less ime , suggesting that burning was overall reduced .",
    "this is apprently confirmed by high o  i  ew values for faint sne .",
    "hvg sne have the fastest and strongest ime lines .",
    "this is , however , not correlated with the presence of ca  ii  hvfs .",
    "actually , sne with the strongest , longer lasting ca  ii  hvfs are lvgs .",
    "longer lasting hvfs may slow down the velocity decline , but this does not explain why among the sne with hvfs the lvg sne have the lower velocities .",
    "our results are based on empirical measurements .",
    "it would be important to test their implications using models .",

    "<S> the values of these quantities at maximum are obtained through interpolation / extrapolation and plotted against the decline rate , and so are various line ratios . </S>",
    "<S> the sne are divided according to their velocity evolution into three classes defined in a previous work of benetti et al . </S>",
    "<S> : low velocity gradient ( lvg ) , high velocity gradient ( hvg ) , and faint . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that all the lvg sne have approximately uniform velocites at b maximum , while the faint sne have values that decrease with increasing @xmath0 , and the hvg sne have a large spread . </S>",
    "<S> the ews of the fe - dominated features are approximately constant in all sne , while those of intermediate mass element ( ime ) lines have larger values for intermediate decliners and smaller values for brighter and faint sne . </S>",
    "<S> the hvg sne have stronger si  ii  6355-lines , with no correlation with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the si  ii  5972  ew and three ew ratios , including one analogous to the @xmath1(si  ii ) ratio introduced by nugent et al . </S>",
    "<S> , are good spectroscopic indicators of luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the data suggest that all lvg sne have approximately constant kinetic energy , since burning to ime extends to similar velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the faint sne may have somewhat lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> the large velocities and ews of the ime lines of hvg sne appear correlated with each other , but are not correlated with the presence of high - velocity features in the ca  ii  infrared triplet in the earliest spectra for the sne for which such data exist .    </S>",
