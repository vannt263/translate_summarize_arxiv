    "beam loss is a critical issue in high - intensity linacs , and much work is done during both the design and operation phases to keep the loss down to manageable levels .",
    "a generally accepted rule of thumb is to keep the loss to less than approximately 1 w / m to allow for hands - on maintenance .",
    "for example , the linac output beam power of the oak ridge spallation neutron source ( sns ) linac is about 1 mw today , and we plan to increase the power to its design value of 1.4 mw over the next few years and then later to about 3  mw . the fractional loss per metre should then be less than about @xmath2 in the high - energy portion of the linac",
    ". the allowable fraction of beam loss will be even lower for the next - generation accelerators , such as the european spallation neutron source .    in general",
    ", beam loss in h@xmath0 linacs is more difficult to manage than in h@xmath1 linacs due to the greater number of loss mechanisms , including residual gas stripping , h@xmath1 capture and acceleration , field stripping , black - body radiation and the recently discovered intra - beam stripping ( ibst ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "mechanisms such as beam halo formation , and ion source or rf turn on / off transients , can cause loss in both h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 linacs .    in this paper we will review beam loss mechanisms in h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 accelerators , drawing mainly from recent work at the sns , but also including examples from other high - intensity accelerator facilities including the los alamos neutron scattering center ( lansce ) facility at los alamos national laboratory , the isis facility at rutherford appleton laboratory , the high intensity proton accelerator ( hipa ) facility at the paul scherrer institute and the japanese proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) .",
    "if h@xmath0 beams have so many more loss mechanisms , why should we bother with them ? the reason is low - loss injection into storage rings and synchrotrons .",
    "certain applications require multiple beam pulses to be injected into the same rf bucket over multiple turns of injection to obtain a large beam charge per pulse .",
    "example applications include spallation neutron sources and neutrino production facilities . the only way to inject multiple beams with low beam loss is to use charge exchange injection , where electrons are stripped off the incoming h@xmath0 ion beam to merge it with the previously injected beam .",
    "charge exchange injection is also required if you want the output beam emittance to be less than the sum of the input emittances ( liouville theorem ) .",
    "the typical beam loss without charge exchange injection is several percent .",
    "this can be acceptable at low - power accelerators , but , for example , at sns , where the design linac beam power is 1.4 mw , if we lose 2% that would correspond to 28 kw , which is clearly unacceptable . with charge exchange injection",
    "the fractional loss is just ( 12 ) @xmath3 , so the beam power lost is only 140240 w.",
    "the beam loss mechanisms that we will be discussing are listed in table  [ tab : blssmech ] .",
    ".beam loss mechanisms for h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 beams [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     another example of beam matching versus beam tails comes from a series of large - dynamic - range wire - scanner beam profile measurements in the sns dtl @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : halo ] shows two cases : the low - loss production tune and after matching the twiss parameters at the dtl entrance .",
    "the low - loss tune shows non - gaussian tails as large as 30% of the peak , starting from the first wire scanner in the dtl .",
    "the well - matched case shows much improved non - gaussian beam tails at the beginning of the dtl , but the losses are higher and the talks start to re - form by the end of the dtl , and then persist throughout the linac and transport lines .    at sns , in the hebt , the dtl and other areas of the accelerator , the low - loss tune does not have well - matched twiss parameters for the core of the beam .",
    "setting up the matched core case is a good place to start the beam loss minimization process , but the minimum - loss case can only be found by empirical adjustments to quadrupole gradients and the rf phases and amplitudes . with our present suite of beam instrumentation",
    "it is not possible to accurately characterize the parameters of the beam tails / halo , and then use that data to better match the beam , because of the limited dynamic ranges of the measurements .      as discussed in the previous section , when the sns accelerator complex is operated with the quadrupole gradients set to the design values ,",
    "the beam loss is high and the same is true for some of the rf cavity phases .",
    "we have empirically found that the loss can be reduced by at least a factor of two by making small adjustments to the matching quadrupole gradients and to certain rf phases .",
    "the minimum beam loss case is very sensitive to certain rf phases , such as those in the dtl .",
    "just 1  degree of phase change can double the beam loss at certain locations .",
    "as the sns accelerator complex has matured , we have worked to bring the quadrupole gradient set points in line with design values from simulation codes . in some cases the simulation codes have been updated to more accurately reflect the actual accelerator , and in other cases low - loss tunes have been found that minimize the discrepancies between the accelerator and the model .",
    "the concept is that model - based adjustments that have a physics basis are better than random adjustments that may lead to a localized minimum in beam loss or to an operating point that is difficult to sustain .",
    "the sns dtl quadrupole gradients are by definition operated according to design , since they are permanent magnets .",
    "the ccl gradients are now also operated very close their design values , starting in august 2012 .",
    "the scl quadrupoles are up to 40% below their design values , to increase the beam size as discussed above .",
    "the hebt quadrupole gradients are mostly operated according to their design values , with the biggest exceptions being at the beginning and end of the hebt , where the lattice changes from the scl to the hebt , and from the hebt to the ring .",
    "the beam loss in the injection dump beam line is very sensitive to changes in the hebt quadrupole gradients .",
    "similar experiences are seen at other accelerator facilities , including lansce @xcite , isis @xcite and the hipa cyclotron at psi . at hipa",
    "the last 2050% of beam loss reduction comes from empirical tuning @xcite .",
    "beam loss is a very important driver to the cost , design and operation of high - intensity h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 accelerators , and will become even more important as next - generation accelerators come online .",
    "beam loss in h@xmath0 accelerators is much more complex than h@xmath1 accelerators due to the many more beam loss mechanisms available to h@xmath0 beams .",
    "modern design and simulation codes can not accurately predict beam loss and so prudent designs must include flexible machine lattices and mitigation measures such as scrapers and collimators . however , the future is bright for the next - generation accelerators that can take advantage of and expand on the observations and experiences of today s high - intensity accelerator facilities .",
