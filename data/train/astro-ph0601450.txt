    "theory provides us with different ways of producing intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) in dense stellar clusters , such as globular clusters .",
    "imbhs are defined here as having a mass larger than that of stellar black holes but smaller than that of the super - massive black holes ( smbh ) found in galaxies , so @xmath4 .",
    "one scenario envisages an imbh to grow from a stellar - mass seed black hole , the remnant of a massive star that exploded as a supernova @xcite .",
    "this seed black hole rapidly sinks to the cluster center due to dynamical friction , or , in the case of a post - core - collapse cluster , was formed near the cluster center since that is where the most massive stars can be found , and grows by accreting stars , less massive stellar black holes or interstellar gas . in a core - collapse cluster , stars near the core are packed so densely that some may collide , causing a runaway growth of the remnant s mass @xcite . both mechanisms seem to lead naturally to imbhs with a mass that is about 0.1% of the cluster mass .",
    "the imbh can be even more massive ( up to @xmath5 ) if it originated from multiple seeds .",
    "another suggested way of forming imbhs considers the radiation drag that is exerted by stars on the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "radiation drag is expected to funnel gas , expelled by snii and snia explosions , towards the cluster center where it is likely to form a massive central object surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "it is expected that this central object will collapse into an imbh if its mass exceeds a few 100 @xmath6 . in massive galaxies",
    ", this process may lead to central black holes that have a mass of about 0.1% of the bulge mass @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of globular clusters , imbhs formed this way are expected to be much less massive than 0.1% of the cluster mass ( the ratio of the imbh mass to the cluster mass is rather of the order of @xmath7 ) .",
    "in fact , clusters less massive than @xmath8 are not expected to contain a central black hole , although they can harbor a central object not massive enough to collapse into a black hole @xcite .",
    "yet another , somewhat more speculative , possibility is that population iii stars , with masses of a few hundred solar masses , were the seeds of imbhs @xcite .",
    "nuclear energy production in population iii stars more massive than @xmath9 can not counteract gravity and such objects immediately collapse into black holes .",
    "such very massive seed black holes , which could be called imbhs in their own right , then grow further by accretion . this way of producing imbhs , unlike the previous ones , does not require the host stellar system to be dense .",
    "therefore , even upper limits on the masses of central black holes in globular clusters are of great interest , since they constrain the possible formation scenarios for imbhs and the nature of imbh progenitors . in this paper",
    ", we present upper limits on the imbh masses of 47tuc and ngc6397 , two of the nearest globular clusters , derived from 20  cm continuum observations , obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . in section",
    "[ detect ] , we briefly discuss how imbhs can be detected via their radio continuum emission . in sect .",
    "[ obs ] , the observations and the data reduction procedures are presented , followed by a discussion of the results in sect .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "while various approaches to the estimation of imbh masses in globular clusters have been suggested and/or applied ( such as dynamical modeling of stellar kinematics , see e.g. gerssen et al . , or the detection of high - proper - motion stars near the globular cluster center @xcite ) one of the observationally least demanding methods is the possibility to detect black holes through the radio emission they produce .",
    "gas that is accreted onto a black hole converts part of its rest mass into radiation which , in the mass regime of imbhs , is most easily recovered at radio wavelengths .",
    "the equation that relates the mass of a black hole , @xmath10 , in a stellar system at a distance @xmath11 to its x - ray luminosity @xmath12 and radio continuum emission @xmath13 reads as @xmath14 assuming a flat radio spectrum @xcite and the fundamental - plane relationship between radio luminosity , x - ray luminosity , and black hole mass @xcite . for a given accretion rate , which is usually expressed as a fraction of the bondi accretion rate @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 and @xmath17 the gas density and temperature ,",
    "respectively ) the x - ray luminosity can be calculated , assuming that 10  % of the rest mass energy of the infalling matter is converted into radiation , and that the total luminosity @xmath18 is related to the x - ray luminosity as given by @xmath19 ( using the eddington luminosity as unit ) .",
    "this relation takes into account the energy of a relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "this way , the radio continuum flux @xmath13 can be expressed as a function of the black hole mass @xmath10 , the distance @xmath11 , and the gas density @xmath16 and temperature @xmath17 . in the following , we will assume @xmath20  @xmath21 and @xmath22  k ( see freire et al . ) as typical values .    as shown by e.g. di matteo et al . and",
    "quataert & gruzinov for nearby early - type galaxies and for the milky way , respectively , massive central black holes seem to accrete much slower than predicted by the bondi estimate ( with @xmath23 ) . the low number of galactic neutron stars that were detected in the rosat all - sky survey can be explained if they are accreting at a rate of roughly 0.1  % of the bondi rate @xcite , although , of course , a neutron star accreting from the interstellar medium is a far cry from a central black hole .",
    "theoretical models of the accretion of matter that has non - zero angular momentum onto a black hole @xcite show a reduction of the accretion rate down to the level of a few percent of the bondi rate . in the following",
    ", we will assume an accretion rate in the range @xmath24 , in agreement with maccarone et al . and maccarone et al .",
    "thus , it is possible to estimate the masses ( or place upper limits thereon ) of central black holes in nearby globular clusters using straightforward and relatively short radio observations .",
    "we observed both ngc6397 and 47tuc with the atca on respectively 2004 december 23 and 26 .",
    "we used the 1.5d configuration , with baselines ranging from 107 to 4439  m. the continuum observations were made at a central frequency of 1.384  ghz in the full_128_1 correlator configuration with a bandwidth of 128  mhz divided over 32 channels into 4 products . at the start of each observation , we observed the standard atca primary calibrator 1934 - 638 for 10  min .",
    "a secondary calibrator was observed every 45  min . the total integration time",
    "( including the calibration ) for each globular cluster was 3.5  h. the data reduction was performed with the miriad package @xcite , the standard atca data analysis program .",
    "the observed data were loaded into miriad with the birdie , xycorr , and reweight options , which respectively flags out the channels that are affected by the atca self - interference , corrects for the phase difference between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels and re - weights the visibility spectrum in the lag domain to eliminate the effects of the gibbs phenomena .",
    "this results in 13 channels , each 4  mhz wide . the usual data reduction steps , including phase , amplitude and bandpass calibration , were afterwards performed .",
    "instead of applying the traditional clean algorithm @xcite we used the multi - frequency synthesis ( mfs ) method @xcite with a natural weighting to surpress the noise .",
    "this improved drastically the ( @xmath27)-coverage by eliminating spectral artifacts .    for ngc6397 , after applying all above reduction steps , we constructed a radio continuum map with a beam size of @xmath28 and a 1@xmath0 noise value of 72  @xmath29jy .",
    "no radio continuum sources could be detected in this object at this noise level .",
    "we therefore assume 216  @xmath29jy as the 3@xmath0 upper limit on the radio emission of the black hole .",
    "our 20  cm map of 47tuc has a depth similar to that presented by mcconnell et al . although it has higher spatial resolution : our final image has a beam size of @xmath30 and a 1@xmath0 noise value of 75  @xmath29jy .",
    "none of the radio continuum sources is close enough to the cluster center to be associated with a putative black hole .",
    "we therefore assume 225  @xmath29jy as the 3@xmath0 upper limit on the radio emission of the black hole .",
    "47tuc is a massive globular cluster , with a total stellar mass @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "its large core radius suggests that it is a relaxed ( and not a post - core - collapse ) cluster @xcite .",
    "we use the distance modulus @xmath32  mag derived by gratton et al . .",
    "ngc6397 on the other hand is a much less massive cluster , with a total stellar mass @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "it is a very centrally concentrated , collapsed cluster . using accurate color - magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions of two fields inside ngc6397 ,",
    "andreuzzi et al . found strong evidence for different mass distributions and hence for mass segregation to have occurred .",
    "we adopt a distance modulus @xmath34  mag @xcite , determined by main - sequence fitting using lower main sequence stars with hipparcos parallaxes measured to a precision of better than 10% .",
    "we estimate upper - limits on the masses of the putative central imbhs in these globular clusters from 3@xmath0 upper limits on the radio continuum flux .",
    "we assume that the putative central black hole accretes the surrounding matter at a rate between 0.1  % and 1  % of the bondi accretion rate and take into account the uncertainty on the distance modulus . for 47tuc",
    ", we find a 3@xmath0 upper limit for the mass of the central black hole of @xmath35 .",
    "for ngc6397 , we derive a 3@xmath0 upper limit of @xmath2 for the black hole mass .",
    "massive elliptical and spiral galaxies seem to adhere closely to a relation between the mass of the central black hole , @xmath10 , and the central velocity dispersion , @xmath36 ( see fig . [ msigma ] ) . depending on the sample selection and the way the linear regression is done , the slope and zero - point of this relation vary @xcite .",
    "the existence of this relation is however generally accepted .",
    "although there is theoretically no obvious reason why this relation should hold with the same slope also in the mass regime of globular clusters , with the growth of smbhs most likely being driven by the merger histories of their host galaxies , it is nevertheless tempting to do so .",
    "the central velocity dispersion of 47tuc , @xmath37  km / s @xcite , corresponds to an imbh mass @xmath38 .",
    "the central velocity dispersion of ngc6397 is very low , @xmath39  km / s @xcite , and corresponds to an imbh mass @xmath40 .",
    "the upper limit for the mass of the black hole in 47tuc lies just below the extrapolated @xmath41 relation of massive elliptical and spiral galaxies as derived by tremaine et al . .",
    "as this concerns a 3@xmath0 upper limit , this means that the mass of the central black hole in 47tuc must be much lower than predicted by this relation , on the condition , of course , that the black hole accretes at a rate higher than 0.1  % of the bondi rate .",
    "it also excluded the presence of a imbh with a mass of about 0.1  % of the cluster mass .",
    "the extrapolated @xmath42 relation as derived by ferrarese & ford predicts lower @xmath10-values in the globular - cluster regime than the tremaine et al .",
    "version and is potentially consistent with our results .",
    "the upper limit for the mass of the black hole in ngc6397 lies above both renditions of the @xmath41 relation and thus puts no extra constraints on this relation in the globular - cluster regime .",
    "given the uncertainty concerning the detection of a black hole in m15 @xcite , this means that no secure detection of an imbh exists in the low - mass regime ( @xmath43  km / s ) of the @xmath41 relation .",
    "radio - continuum observations of @xmath44cen yielded a 3@xmath0 upper limit of @xmath45 , depending on the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "we adopt a distance of @xmath46  kpc and a central velocity dispersion @xmath47  km / s @xcite .",
    "dynamical modeling of the central regions of the local group galaxies ngc205 @xcite and m33 @xcite has yielded no conclusive evidence for imbhs in the @xmath48  km / s regime ( with m33 , in fact , well below the 1@xmath0 uncertainties of the extrapolated @xmath41 relations ) .",
    "this leaves g1 as the only object with a relatively secure detection of a sub-@xmath49 imbh @xcite and that agrees with the extrapolated @xmath41 relation .",
    "using radio - continuum observations with the atca radio telescope array , we estimate the 3@xmath0 upper - limits on the masses of the putative central imbhs in two nearby galactic globular clusters , 47tuc and ngc6397 , at respectively @xmath35 and @xmath50 .",
    "these mass estimates have been derived from 3@xmath0 upper limits on the radio continuum flux .",
    "we assume that the putative central black hole accretes the surrounding matter at a rate between 0.1  % and 1  % of the bondi accretion rate and take into account the uncertainty on the distance modulus .",
    "black hole masses estimated using radio - continuum observations by necessity depend on assumptions regarding the density and temperature of the interstellar medium , and on the accretion rate",
    ". observations of a few globular clusters provide `` typical '' values for the characteristics of the interstellar medium .",
    "the black hole accretion rate can be constrained by observations of the central black hole of the milky way and by theoretical models of accretion disks .",
    "still , radio - continuum estimates of black hole masses probably can not boast the same degree of accuracy as mass estimates from e.g. dynamical models .",
    "however , while dynamical models fitted to radial velocities and proper motions of stars near the center of a globular cluster yield the most accurate mass estimates , their spatial resolution is not high enough to identify the central dark mass as a black hole . if , on the other hand , one detects radio emission coming from accreted matter falling into a steep gravitational well then one can be sure that the central object must be very compact , i.e. a black hole",
    ". a cluster of white dwarfs or neutron stars would not be able to generate such a feature . in a way , both methods are complementary .",
    "still , it seems telling that we obtain a 3@xmath0 upper - limit for the mass of the putative central black hole in 47tuc , a nearby massive globular cluster , that places this object marginally below the extrapolation of the @xmath41 relation of the bright ellipticals and spirals .",
    "the data for ngc6397 unfortunately do not constrain the low - mass end of the @xmath41 relation .",
    "our results hopefully form the basis for further attempts to detect imbhs in these globular clusters , which , in the case of a detection , would lead to a better understanding of the low - mass tail of the black - hole population and of the accretion rates of central imbhs in globular clusters .",
    "we would like to thank bob sault for allowing these observations to be executed during director s green time .",
    "sven de rijcke thanks the fund for scientific research@xmath51flanders ( belgium ) for approving a travel grant .",
    "pieter buyle wishes to thank the bijzonder onderzoeksfonds ( bof ) of ghent university for financial support .",
