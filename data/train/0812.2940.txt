    "the flexibility and bistability are the two key points in the next generation display technologies .",
    "the flexibility implies the display would be thin , lightweight , and ultimately , paper like , meaning it would be cheap enough to be disposable .",
    "the bistability implies the technology would be ecologically friendly . in the bistable display",
    ", the image does not need to be refreshed until rewritten and , therefore , a low level of power consumption is expected for still images .",
    "unfortunately , for motion pictures , the bistability has no advantages in power savings over nonbistable technologies such as liquid crystal displays ( lcds ) , plasma display panels ( pdps ) , and displays based on organic light emitting diodes commonly referred to as oleds .",
    "the display technologies based on particles are the most prominent candidates for a flexible and bistable displays .",
    "the earliest display based on particles dates back to 1970 s when ota@xcite filed for a patent .",
    "since then various particle - displays based on electrophoresis and electrowetting principles have emerged to form what is now referred to as `` e - paper technologies '' in the industry.@xcite in electrophoresis , particles are usually suspended in a fluid . because the speed at which particles move inversely vary with fluid density , particle - displays based on electrophoresis have slow response time , typically on the order of @xmath0@xcite this makes motion pictures unsuitable for electrophoretic particle - displays .",
    "the issue of slow response time in electrophoretic particle - displays , however , has been resolved with the unveil of quick response liquid powder display ( qr - lpd ) by hattori et al.@xcite the qr - lpd is distinguished from the rest of particle based displays in that it uses air as the particle carrying medium rather than fluid . because the particles in qr - lpd move in air , its response time is at @xmath1 which is even faster than lcds .",
    "the submillisecond response time makes qr - lpd the only candidate based on particle - display capable of handling motion pictures , and researches are being conducted for particle - displays with air as the particle carrying medium.@xcite    common to all particle - displays , regardless of whether air or fluid is used as the particle carrying medium , is the lack of continuous grayscale . here ,",
    "the terminology , `` continuous grayscale , '' is referred to as the number of grayscale levels required to produce desired number of colors . in principle , a display device with continuous grayscale can generate an infinite range of colors .",
    "that being clarified , a high grayscale range is essential to quality displays . without it , the images displayed on monitors",
    "would be dull.@xcite recently , it has been reported particle - display based on qr - lpd can generate up to 16 grayscale levels ( i.e. , 4 bits ) , which corresponds to the capability of generating 4096 colors.@xcite to the proponents of other competing flat panel display technologies , such as flexible lcds , pdps , or oleds , 4 bits of gray scale range could hardly be considered a technological milestone . however , considering only 4 grayscale levels were possible just a few years ago for particle - displays , 16 grayscale levels is a significant technological advancement for the e - paper technology.@xcite    the most well known e - paper technology , e - ink , obtains different gray states through modulation of voltages supplied to the control electrodes .",
    "the same mechanism is employed by particle - displays based on qr - lpd for achieving different gray states.@xcite because the voltage is modulated at a value lower than the saturation voltage , which is the voltage required to display either all black or all white for a simple black - and - white display , the displayed image would have intensity somewhere between that of completely black and completely white .",
    "this approach to achieve different gray states , however , is done at the cost of losing bistability . since the pixel is being constantly modulated to sustain a gray state , the situation is equivalent to motion pictures and the power savings from bistability no longer applies to gray states . in spite of the lost bistability advantages over the other competing flexible display technologies ,",
    "the speed at which particle can be modulated is limited by its finite inertia ( mass ) and this places a practical limit on the extent to which the grayscale levels of particle - display can be enhanced by the aforementioned method .",
    "most recently , chim@xcite demonstrated a 64 grayscale levels ( or 6bits ) for particle - display based on qr - lpd for his masters thesis project at delft university of technology .",
    "however , to generate 64 grayscale levels , the data driver , which is a serial to parallel shift register that shifts data words of 6 bits per clock cycle , is required .",
