    "an object that is not superimposable on its mirror image is termed as chiral object .",
    "chiral objects do not show reflection symmetry , but may exhibit rotational symmetry .",
    "they are not necessarily asymmetric , because they can have other types of symmetry .",
    "an object is achiral ( non - chiral ) if and only if it has an axis of improper rotation ( rotation by 360@xmath2/@xmath3 ) followed by a reflection in the plane perpendicular to this axis .",
    "thus , an object is chiral if and only if it lacks such an axis .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking or restoration is a key ingredient in different problems of theoretical physics : from nonperturbative quantum cromodynamics to highly doped semiconductors ( garcia - garcia & cuevas 2006 ) . for a pseudoscalar meson , it is found that the chiral symmetry breaking decreases with increasing current - quark mass ( chang et al .",
    "bagchi et al . ( 2006 ) studied the large color approximation of the compact strange stars and discussed the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "they claimed that the chiral symmetry restoration can be understood by exploring the possible existence of strange stars in the universe . in principle , microscopic process have triggered huge astrophysical large scale structure ( liddle & lyth 2000 ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the breaking or restoration of chiral symmetry not only in microscopic phenomena ( l - neutrino , mesons , l - aminoacids , d - sugars , etc ) , but also in macroscopic ones ( stars , molecular clouds , galaxies ) .",
    "according to the basic concepts of cosmology , initial quantum fluctuations have been hugely enhanced during the inflationary epoch , leading the formation of the large scale structure in the universe ( peacock 1999 , liddle & lyth 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the macroscopic chirality should be related to some primordial microscopic process which led to the today s observed large scale structures ( fall 1982 ) .",
    "differential rotation in a galaxy s disc generate density waves in the disc , leading to spiral arms . according to gravitational theory , the spiral arms born as leading and subsequently transform to trailing modes . with the passage of time , the spiral pattern deteriorates gradually by the differential rotation of the equatorial plane of the galaxy , but the bar structure persists for a long time ( oort 1970a ) .",
    "this structure can again regenerate spiral pattern in the outer region .",
    "thus , a close relation between the origin of the arms in the spirals and barred spirals can not be denied ( oort 1970b ) .    by considering",
    "the group of transformations acting on the configuration space , capozziello & lattanzi ( 2006 ) revealed that the spiral galaxies possesses chiral symmetry in the large scale structure .",
    "in addition , they predicted that the progressive loss of chirality might have some connection with the rotationally - supported ( spirals , barred spirals ) and randomized stellar systems ( lenticulars , ellipticals ) .",
    "aryal , acharya & saurer ( 2007 ) carried out a study to test the capozziello and lattanzi s ( 2006 ) prediction regarding the progressive loss of chirality in the large scale structure .",
    "they analysed the distribution of leading and trailing arm galaxies in the local supercluster ( lsc ) and concluded the existence of chiral symmetry for both the spirals and the barred spirals .",
    "however , the virgo cluster galaxies show a preferred alignment : the galactic rotation axes of leading and trailing structures are found to lie in the equatorial plane .",
    "aryal & saurer ( 2005a ) noticed a preferred alignment for the late - type spirals and barred spirals in the local supercluster .",
    "in addition , they found that the spin vector projections of early- and late - type galaxies show opposite alignment .",
    "their results hint the existence of the chiral characterization .    in this work",
    ", we present an analysis of chiral property of field galaxies having radial velocity ( rv ) 3000 km s@xmath0 to 5000 km s@xmath0 .",
    "we intend to study the importance of chiral symmetry in order to understand the structural modes of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , we expect to study the following : ( 1 ) does chirality exist for the spirals and barred spirals in the field ? ( 2 ) is there any correlation between the chirality and preferred alignment of galaxies ?",
    "( 3 ) does the group of galaxies exhibit chiral characterization ? and finally ,",

    "now it is well known that the dark matter halo dominates the dynamics of the galaxies throughout . in our own galaxy ,",

    "these results hint that the distribution of angular momentum of galaxies is entirely random in two- ( s- and z - shaped ) and three - dimensional ( spin vector ) analysis provided the database is rich .",
    "thus , choice of rotation ( approaching or receding , near or far parts ) of individual galaxy might be random for a observer .",
    "we used computer and gave random direction to our galaxies .",
    "each galaxy got a virtual direction by the computer .",
    "after then , the arm patterns ( s- or z - type ) the galaxies were studied visually by one of the authors ( pl ) in order to maintain homogeneity . the digitized sky survey ( dss ) image and the contour maps of the galaxies were studied in order to identify their structural modes . for this",

    "the leading mode is one whose outer tip points towards the direction of galactic rotation ( see fig",
    "similarly , the outer tip of trailing mode directs in the direction opposite to the galactic rotation .",
    "the re - examination of the arms using iraf software resulted the rejection of more than 23% of the objects .",
    "these rejected galaxies were nearly edge - on galaxies .",
    "as expected , it was relatively easier to identify the structural modes of nearly face - on than that of nearly edge - on galaxies .    in this way , we compiled a database of 1621 galaxies showing either leading or trailing structural mode . * for individual galaxies , these structural modes might be incorrect . as a gross",

    "( 2007 , hereafter paper 1 ) compiled a database of 667 leading and trailing arm galaxies in the lsc ( rv @xmath15 3000 km s@xmath0 ) and studied the chiral property in the total sample and 17 subsamples . in the present study ,",
    "the database is compiled from the field galaxies having rv in the range 3000 to 5000 km s@xmath0 .",
    "thus , we are moving deep inside the sky and studying the existence of chiral property in the present work .",
    "the distribution of the total trailing and leading structures in the lsc ( paper 1 ) as well as in the field galaxies ( present work ) are found homogeneous ( fig .",
    "the difference between the leading and trailing arm galaxies are turned well within 5% error limit .",
    "this result indicate the fact that the chiral property is a global phenomenon rather than a local phenomenon .    for the spirals , we noticed no deviation from the chirality .",
    "however , paper 1 found a slight deviation because of the presence of the virgo cluster .",
    "interestingly , we noticed the violation of chirality in the barred spirals ( sb ) whereas paper 1 concluded the sb galaxies as a chiral object .",
    "for other morphological types ( irregulars , morphologically unidentified galaxies ) , our result is similar to that of the previous result .    in the pa - distribution",
    ", we noticed a random alignment for the trailing arm galaxies whereas paper 1 concludes no preferred alignments for the leading arm galaxies . in this work ,",
    "a preferred alignment is noticed for the leading arm galaxies .",
    "in contrast to this , a preferred alignment for the trailing arm galaxies is concluded in paper 1 .",
    "this contradiction is interesting in the sense that the nature of the databases are different in the past ( lsc galaxies having rv @xmath15 3000 km s@xmath0 ) and the present ( field galaxies having 3000 @xmath15 rv ( km s@xmath0 ) @xmath18 5000 ) study . the preferred alignment in both the studies are obviously different . for leading arm lsc galaxies",
    ", they found that the galactic rotation axes tend to lie in the equatorial plane . in our case",
    ", we noticed that the rotation axes of the trailing arm galaxies tend to be oriented perpendicular the equatorial plane .",
    "paper 1 concludes a similar preferred alignment in the leading and trailing structures in the virgo cluster galaxies : the galactic rotation axes tend to lie in the equatorial plane .",
    "we noticed a similar result for the early - type spirals ( leading mode ) , late - type barred spirals ( trailing mode ) and the group gr2 ( leading mode ) .",
    "an important similarity is found in the past and present study : late - type galaxies show chiral property , whereas this property is found to be violated in the early - type galaxies .    in this way",
    ", we noticed few inconsistencies in the present and the previous work .",
    "it should be remembered that these inconsistencies are profounded either due to the poor statistics or because of the bias in the sample classification .",
    "we combined the database of the paper 1 and the present work , and studied the basis statistics .",
    "a strong chirality ( @xmath14 @xmath15 1% , @xmath40 @xmath15 0.010 and @xmath87 @xmath15 5% ) is found in the total and the spiral galaxies .",
    "however , the @xmath14 value is found to be greater than 10% for the barred spirals .",
    "thus , the total and the spiral galaxies having rvs less than 5000 km s@xmath0 strongly exhibit chiral symmetry .",
    "it seems that the chirality loss sequence ( spiral @xmath102 barred spiral @xmath102 elliptical ) as predicted by capozziello and lattanzi ( 2006 ) might be true .",
    "aryal & saurer ( 2004 , 2005b , 2006 ) and aryal , paudel & saurer ( 2007 ) studied the spatial orientation of galaxies in 32 abell clusters of bm type i ( 2004 ) , bm type iii ( 2005b ) , bm type ii - iii ( 2006 ) and bm type ii ( 2007 ) and found a significant preferred alignment in the late - type cluster ( bm type ii - iii , bm type iii ) .",
    "they concluded that the randomness decreases systematically in galaxy alignments from early - type ( bm type i , ii ) to late - type ( bm type ii - iii , iii ) clusters .",
    "thus , the existance of chirality in bm type i cluster , as predicted by capozziello and lattanzi ( 2006 ) might be true . because we noticed a very good correlation between the randomness and the chirality .",
    "probably , this result reveals the fact that the progressive loss of chirality might have some connection with the rotationally supported ( spirals , barred spirals ) to the randomized ( lenticulars , ellipticals ) system .",
    "thus , we suspect that the dynamical processes in the cluster evolution ( such as late - type clusters ) give rise to a dynamical loss of chirality . in other word",
    ", a good correlation between the achirality and anisotropy can be suspected for the late - type clusters .",
    "it would be interesting to test this prediction by analysing the chiral property of spirals in the late - type clusters in the future .",
    "we studied the chiral property of 1621 field galaxies having radial velocity ( rv ) in the range 3000 km s@xmath0 to 5000 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of leading and trailing structural modes is studied in the total sample and 34 subsamples . to examine non - random effects , the equatorial position angle ( pa ) distribution of galaxies in the total sample and subsamples are studied . in order to discriminate anisotropy from the isotropy",
    "we have performed three statistical tests : chi - square , auto - correlation and the fourier .",
    "our results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the homogeneous distribution of the total trailing and the total leading arm galaxies is found , suggesting the existence of chiral symmetry in the field galaxies having rvs 3000 km s@xmath0 to 5000 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the pa - distribution of trailing arm galaxies is found to be random , whereas preferred alignment is noticed for leading arm galaxies .",
    "it is found that the galactic rotation axes of leading structural modes tend to be oriented perpendicular the equatorial plane .",
    "leading structural modes are found 3.7% @xmath1 1.8% more than that of the trailing modes in the spirals whereas a significant dominance ( 17% @xmath1 8.5% ) of trailing modes are noticed in the barred spirals .",
    "this difference is found @xmath37 8% for the irregulars and the morphologically unidentified galaxies .",
    "a random alignment is noticed in the pa - distribution of leading and trailing spirals .",
    "thus , it is noticed that the random alignment of the pas of galaxies lead the existence of chiral property of galaxies . in other words , a good correlation between the preferred alignment and the chiral symmetry breaking is found .",
    "this result verifies the previous result ( paper 1 ) .",
    "the chirality is found stronger for the late - type spirals ( sc , scd , sd and sm ) than that of early - type ( sa , sab , sb and sbc ) .",
    "similar result is found for the late - type barred spirals .",
    "thus , the late - type galaxies are the best candidates for the chiral objects than that of the early - types .",
    "4 .   a very good correlation between the number of leading and trailing arm galaxies are found in the rv subsamples .",
    "all 4 subsamples show the @xmath14 value less than 5% .",
    "thus , we conclude that the chirality of field galaxies remain invariant with the global expansion",
    "the galaxies having rvs 3000 km s@xmath0 to 4000 km s@xmath0 show a random alignment for both the leading and the trailing structural modes .",
    "the rotation axes of leading and trailing arm galaxies having 4000 @xmath15 rv ( km s@xmath0 ) @xmath18 4500 tend to be oriented perpendicular the equatorial plane .",
    "the galaxies possesses the chiral symmetry in @xmath88 80% area of the sky .",
    "this property is found to be violated in few groups of galaxies .",
    "two such groups ( gr2 and gr8 ) are identified . in these groups , the structural dominance and the preferred alignments of galaxies are found to oppose each other .",
    "aryal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) studied the chiral property of the local supercluster galaxies ( rv @xmath15 3000 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "if we include their database , we found a strong ( @xmath14 @xmath15 1% ) chiral behavior by the total and the spiral galaxies .",
    "however , the @xmath14 value is found to be greater than 10% for the barred spirals .",
    "hence , the total and the spiral galaxies having rv @xmath15 5000 km s@xmath0 show chiral property .",
    "thus , the chirality - loss sequence ( spiral @xmath102 barred spiral @xmath102 elliptical ) as proposed by capozziello and lattanzi ( 2006 ) might be true .",
    "the true structural mode of a galaxy must involve a determination of which side of the galaxy is closer to the observer ( binney and tremaine 1987 ) .",
