    "the lightcurves of x - ray binary pulsars show periodic intensity variations with the spin of the neutron star and its orbital motion . but",
    "a few of the persistent x - ray binary pulsars also show a long term periodic intensity variation with time scales more than an order of magnitude greater than the orbital period of the binary .",
    "periodic superorbital intensity variations are seen in her x-1 ( 35 day : still & boyd 2004 ) , lmc x-4 ( 30.5 day : paul & kitamoto 2002 ) and 2s 0114 + 650 ( 30.7 day : farrell et al 2006 ) .",
    "smc x-1 shows quasi periodic superorbital intensity variations with a 50 - 60 day cycle ( clarkson et al .",
    "the intensity variations in these systems are understood to be due to obscuration of the central x - ray source by a warped precessing accretion disc .",
    "spectral studies of her x-1 and lmc x-4 show iron line intensity and equivalent width evolving during the superorbital periods .",
    "also the absorption column density in the line of sight is found to be higher during the low intensity states indicating an excess of absorbing matter in the line of sight during these times ( naik & paul 2003 ) .",
    "cen x-3 is a high mass x - ray binary pulsar with very strong but aperiodic long term intensity variations ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this is the first x - ray pulsar discovered ( giaconni et al .",
    "1971 ) and is also the brightest persistent pulsar .",
    "it has a spin period of @xmath04.8 s and an overall spin - up trend with alternate spin - up and spin - down intervals which last from about 10 to 100 days ( finger , wilson & fishman 1994 ) .",
    "it has an orbital period of 2.1 days and a companion star of about @xmath1 ( avni & bahcall 1974 ) .",
    "though cen x-3 is a persistent pulsar , its binary period averaged x - ray intensity varies by a factor of more than 40 ( paul , raichur & mukherjee 2005 ) . as the long term intensity variation of cen x-3 does not remotely appear to have any periodic or quasi - periodic nature ( paul et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is natural to assume that the x - ray flux variation is due to changing mass accretion rate .",
    "however , using a strong dependence of the orbital modulation and the pulsed fraction of cen x-3 on its x - ray intensity state we have shown that the long term x - ray intensity variation in this source can be due to change in obscuration by an aperiodically precessing warped accretion disk ( raichur and paul 2008 ) . in this scenario , as the x - ray intensity decreases , reprocessed and unpulsed x - rays from a relatively large scattering medium progressively dominates the observed x - ray intensity .",
    "we further investigate this hypothesis using the quasi periodic oscillations ( qpo ) in cen x-3 with respect to its intensity state . in the accretion powered x - ray pulsars ,",
    "the qpos are understood to be due to inhomogenities in the inner accretion disk and therefore its frequency is expected to be related to the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
    "a correlation between the qpo frequency and x - ray luminosity ( and hence mass accretion rate / inner disk radius ) has been observed in several transient and persistent x - ray sources which show a large range of x - ray intensity ( exo 2030 + 375 : angelini , stella & parmar 1989 , 3a 0535 + 262 : finger , wilson & harmon 1996 , xte j1858 + 034 : mukherjee et al .",
    "2006 , 4u 162667 : kaur et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "qpos are known to be present in all types of accreting x - ray pulsars . in most sources",
    "it is a transient phenonema and qpos have been detected in about a dozen out of about a hundred known accreting x - ray pulsars . with a few exceptions ( 4u 1748 - 288 : zhang et al .",
    "1996 and xte j 0111.2 - 7317 : kaur et al .",
    "2007 ) the qpo frequency is ususally in the range of 40 - 200 mhz , consistent with it being related to the inner radius of the accretion disk around a highly magnetised neutron star in its bright x - ray state .",
    "previous studies of cen x-3 power spectrum have shown quasi periodic oscillation ( qpo ) at @xmath2 mhz ( takeshima et al .",
    "1991 ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we have mainly studied the qpos of cen x-3 and its relation to the source intensity if any . for this",
    "we have analysed all the available archival data of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ proportional courter array ( pca ) from the year 1996 to 2000 .",
    "cen x-3 was observed extensively by _ rxte_-pca during 1996 - 1998 and again for some time in 2000 .",
    "we have analysed x - ray lightcurves from all the data available during this period .",
    "a total of 525 ks data was obtained from 81 pointings carried out in this period .",
    "very few of the observations were carried out during the eclipse or ingres / egress of eclipse and data collected during these periods were excluded from further analysis .",
    "table 1 gives details of the observations .",
    "light curves were extracted from all the observations using standard - i data which has a time resolution of 0.125 s. power spectrum was obtained for each of these observations using the standard - i lightcurve from data streches of duration 1024 s. power spectra from all such stretches within one observation pointing were averaged and normalised such that their integral gives the squared rms fractional variability and the expected white noise level was subtracted .",
    "we have detected qpo features at different frequencies as described below . however , qpo features were not present in all the data sets .",
    "table 2 lists mid - times of the 11 segments in which qpos were detected along with the qpo frequencies .",
    "we have detected the earlier reported qpos around 40 mhz in all of the years although not in every observation .",
    "the qpo at 90 mhz was seen only in the observations made in 1996 and never again . the two qpos 40 mhz and 90 mhz",
    "are not seen together . in all the power spectra in which the qpos were detected ,",
    "the peak associated with pulsar spin period was seen very clearly at @xmath3 hz along with several harmonics .",
    "as reported earlier , pulsations were not detected below a background subtracted count rate of 50 per proportional counter unit with an upper limit of 0.8 % on the pulsed fraction ( raichur and paul 2008 ) .",
    "some representative power spectra in different intensity states , with and without the qpo features are shown in figure 2 and figure 3 .",
    "another feature seen in most of the power spectra is a broadening of the fundamental spin frequency peak . to investigate the reason for this broadening we chose the observation which had the highest rms of the spin frequency broadening feature ( obs .",
    "i d p20104 , tjd of observation 10508.012 - 10508.713 ) .",
    "the total length of this observation is about 60608 s and it gives 51 intervals of 1024 s each .",
    "a final power spectrum using 1024 s of data streches averaged over all the intervals was made and then fitted with the model power spectrum given by lazzati and stella ( 1997 ) .",
    "the model power spectrum considers the fact that any aperiodic variability in the emission from accretion column(s ) of a magnetic neutron star should be modulated at the x - ray pulsar period , hence giving rise to a coupling between the periodic and aperiodic variability ( burderi et al .",
    "1997 ; menna et al .",
    "the coupling parameter r as defined in the model , is a measure of the degree of coupling between the periodic and the aperiodic variabilities .",
    "the effects due to a finite length of the lightcurve are built into the model .",
    "fitting this model ( equation 5 of lazzati and stella 1997 ) to our power spectrum gives @xmath4 , similar to the results derived by lazzati and stella ( 1997 ) using exosat data for cen x-3 .",
    "a value of r @xmath5 1.0 or greater indicates a strong coupling between the aperiodic and periodic variabilities .    in the top panel of figure 4 ,",
    "a plot of the qpo frequency is shown against the 2 - 30 kev x - ray flux measured with the pca . to determine the x - ray fluxes we have fitted the x - ray spectra with a simple model consisting of a high energy cut - off power law along with line of sight absorption and iron emission lines .",
    "part of the x - ray light curves that showed pre - eclipse x - ray dips were excluded from x - ray flux determination .",
    "the pca x - ray light curves from which the power spectra have been generated represent the instantaneous measurement of x - ray flux over a small period of a few ks .",
    "however , even outside the x - ray eclipse , within one orbital period , the x - ray intensity of cen x-3 varies smoothly by more than a factor of two and rapidly by a factor of upto 4 during the pre - eclipse dips . in a circular orbit ,",
    "the orbital intensity variation is due to different visibility of the x - ray source and its reprocessing region rather than changing mass accretion rate .",
    "therefore , we have also looked at the qpo frequency against the orbital phase averaged x - ray intensity using data from the all sky monitor ( asm ) onboard _",
    "rxte_. asm has three detectors which scan the sky in a series of 90 s dwells in 3 energy bands , namely 1.5 - 3 , 3 - 5 and 5 - 12 kev ( levine , et .",
    "al.,1996 ) . the combined asm lightcurve with about 10 - 20 exposures during each binary orbit of cen x-3 gives a better estimate of the overall x - ray intensity state of the source .",
    "we used the corresponding binary period averaged count rates from asm lightcurve to see any dependence of the qpo frequency on the x - ray intensity .",
    "the asm count rates given in table 2 are obtained from orbital period averaged lightcurve after removal of data taken during the eclipse .",
    "a plot of the qpo frequency with asm count rate is shown in the bottom panel of figure 4 .",
    "it is very clear from the figure that there is no dependence of qpo frequency with the instantaneous or orbital phase averaged x - ray intensity .",
    "the qpo features are clustered around two frequencies , 40 mhz and 90 mhz . even within each cluster , there is no dependence of qpo frequency with the x - ray intensity . in the top panel of figure 4",
    "we have also shown a plot of expected qpo frequency as a function of the x - ray flux in the beat frequency model . to calculate the x - ray flux expected by the beat frequency model we have taken a source distance of 8 kpc ( krzeminski 1974 ) , and a magnetic field strength of @xmath6 g ( coburn et .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we have also carried out an energy resolved qpo analysis from one of the observations ( i d p10132 ) in which strong qpos were detected at @xmath2 mhz using energy resolved binned mode and event mode data .",
    "we extracted lightcurves with time resolution of 0.125 s in energy bands of 2 - 4.1 , 4.1 - 6.6 , 6.6 - 9.5 , 9.5 - 13.1 , 13.1 - 16.7 , 16.7 - 20.4 , 20.4 - 25.7 and 25.7 - 34.8 kev .",
    "the energy resolved analysis of the 40 mhz qpo , as shown in figure 5 did not reveal any measurable dependence of the rms fractional variability on energy .",
    "energy resolved analysis for the 90 mhz qpo could not be done as the data from the corresponding observation did not have the required energy and timing resolution in any of the data storage modes .",
    "we can summarize the principal results of our analysis presented in the previous section as follows :      \\2 .",
    "the presence of the qpos or the frequency of the qpos are not related to the luminosity state of the source .",
    "the rms fluctuations associated with the qpos are not correlated with the luminosity of the source .        in the discussion that follows we argue that the observed qpo properties of cen x-3 is in agreement with the scenario in which the long term x - ray intensity variation is due to change in obscuration by an aperiodically precessing warped accretion disk ( raichur and paul 2008 ) .",
    "the radius of the inner accretion disk around a magnetised neutron star with a mass of 1.4 @xmath7 and a radius of 10 km can also be approximately expressed in terms of its magnetic moment and x - ray luminosity as ( frank , king and raine 1992 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the x - ray luminosity in the units of @xmath10 erg and @xmath11 is the magnetic moment in units of @xmath12 g @xmath13 . for disc accretion , often a scaling factor of 0.5",
    "is used with the above expression of @xmath14 .",
    "then the radius of the inner accretion disk would be @xmath15 .",
    "coburn et .",
    "2002 ) have estimated the magnetic field of cen x-3 neutron star to be @xmath16 g ( i.e , @xmath17 ) using the cyclotron absorption line in the x - ray spectrum of the source .",
    "the lowest and the highest 3 - 30 kev x - ray flux at which the 40 mhz qpo feature is seen are @xmath18 and @xmath19 erg @xmath20s@xmath21 respectively . assuming a distance of 8 kpc ( krzeminski 1974 ) , these correspond to x - ray luminosity of @xmath22 erg s@xmath21 and @xmath23 erg s@xmath21 . if the observed x - ray luminosity represents the true x - ray luminosity and a proportional mass accretion rate of cen x-3 , the inner accretion disk radius ( @xmath24 ) will approximately vary between @xmath25 cm and @xmath26 cm .",
    "we note that the corotation radius of cen x-3 ( @xmath27 s ) is @xmath28 , larger than the inner disk radius for the lowest x - ray luminosity , and the qpo detections are outside a possible propeller regime .",
    "the two largely used qpo models are the beat frequency model ( bfm ) and the keplarian frequency model ( kfm ) .",
    "the bfm explains the qpo as the beat between the spin frequency @xmath29 and the keplarian frequency @xmath30 of the inner accretion disk @xmath31 .",
    "thus the radius of the inner accretion disk according the bfm is given as follows .",
    "@xmath32 in kfm , the qpo occurs at the keplarian frequency of the inner accretion disk @xmath33",
    ". then radius of the inner accretion disk due to kfm will be @xmath34    however , in the case of cen x-3 , as the @xmath29 is larger than the observed qpo frquencies , kfm is not applicable .",
    "this is because if the inner accretion disk rotates slower than the neutron star , propeller effect is expected to inhibit accretion of material from the accretion disk . thus assuming an inner accretion disk origin of the qpos and using equations 1 and 2",
    ", one can experss a relation between the qpo frequency and the x - ray luminosity . in the top panel of figure 4 , we have shown the expected qpo frequency against the measured x - ray for a source distance of 8 kpc .",
    "it is obvious from the figure that the qpo frequency of cen x-3 does not have the flux dependence as expected in the beat frequency model .    from a study of the x - ray intensity dependence of the orbital modulation and pulsed fraction in cen x-3 , recently we have proposed that the different flux states of cen x-3 are primarily due to varying degree of obscuration by an aperiodically precessing warped accretion disk ( raichur and paul 2008 ) .",
    "the nearly constant qpo frequency ( ignoring the rare 90 mhz feature ) reported here is indeed consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "we propose that the mass accretion rate and thus the inner accretion disk radius of cen x-3 is not highly variable , thus the source produces a nearly constant qpo frequency .",
    "we note here that the frequencies predicted by the bfm are significantly larger than the measured ones .",
    "however , the expression used here for magnetospheric radius is only approximate and a different prescription for the magnetospheric radius ( for example if it is considerably larger than @xmath14 given in equation 1 ) can explain the observed qpo frequencies at the highest observed x - ray flux state and also be consistent with the proposal that the qpo frequency is insensitive to the measured x - ray flux as the x - ray flux variation is primarily due to disk obscuration .",
    "we also note the other possibility that the qpos in cen x-3 may not be due to any material inhomogenity in the inner accretion disk as is the case for a few other x - ray binary pulsars like a0535 + 262 ( finger et al .",
    "1996 ) , exo 2030 + 375 ( angelini et al . 1989 ) xte j1858 + 034 ( mukherjee et al . 2006 ) and 4u 162667 ( kaur et al . 2008 ) . in these transient binary x - ray pulsars ,",
    "the qpo frequency is well or somewhat correlated with the x - ray luminosity of the source and hence the qpo frequency variations are understood to be due to changes in the mass accretion rate and associated changes in the radius of the inner accretion disk .",
    "one study which could give us more insight would be to study the emission lines from neutral , h - like and he - like iron atoms in the photoionised circumstellar material .",
    "such spectral observations done during the eclipse ingress and egress of the source would give us knowledge of the distance at which the lines are produced .",
    "measurements carried out at different intensity states of the source will tell us if the observed x - ray intensity is a true measure of the x - ray luminosity and the ionization parameter .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for many suggestions that helped us to improve the paper .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight centre .",
