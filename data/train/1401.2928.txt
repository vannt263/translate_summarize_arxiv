    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite isospin chemical potential is an interesting subject to study .",
    "it combined with the finite baryon number chemical potential will provide a clue to understand the symmetry energy which is important to describe the equation of state inside neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it may give some informations on the structure of the chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "when we turn on the isospin chemical potential @xmath0 at zero baryon number density , the pion condensation is expected to occur at a critical point .",
    "son and stephanov @xcite showed that , using the chiral lagrangian at @xmath1 , the phase transition to the pion condensation phase is of the second order and the critical value of @xmath0 is equal to the pion mass .",
    "it was also shown  @xcite that @xmath5 condenses in the high isospin density limit .",
    "then a conjecture of no phase transition from the pion condensation phase to @xmath5 condensation phase was made .",
    "the structure in the mid @xmath0 region is highly non - perturbative issue , so that it is not easy to understand such a region .",
    "a pure isospin matter with zero baryon density can be simulated by the lattice analysis .",
    "references  @xcite shows that the phase transition is of the second order , and that the critical chemical potential is equal to the pion mass .",
    "due to the existence of the sign problem , it is difficult to apply the lattice analysis for studying the hadron property at the finite baryon number density . in this sense ,",
    "analysis by models may give some clues to understand the phase structure and the relevant phenomenon in the mid @xmath0 region .",
    "actually , many analyses were done by using the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , the random matrix model  @xcite , the strong coupling lattice analysis  @xcite , ginzburg - landau approach  @xcite , the hadron resonance gas model  @xcite , holographic qcd models  @xcite .",
    "although there are so many works on the pion condensation at finite isospin chemical potential , there are not many works for studying the strength of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "namely , it is interesting to ask whether or not the chiral symmetry is partially restored in the isospin matter .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , based on the njl model analysis , the authors seemed to conclude that the reduction of @xmath6 in the isospin matter implies the partial chiral symmetry restoration . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ginzburg - landau approach is used to study the the @xmath7 condensate together with the pion condensation .",
    "however , the absolute strength of the chiral symmetry breaking , which is characterized by the chiral condensate @xmath8 , is not clearly studied .",
    "the analysis using the strong coupling lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that @xmath3 decreases in the high isospin chemical potential associated with the decreasing pion condensation .",
    "the decreasing pion condensation might be a special feature in the strong coupling lattice analysis , so that it would be interesting to study the behavior of @xmath3 using the various ways .    in this work",
    ", we study the pion condensation phase in a holographic qcd model  @xcite by solving the equations of motion for mean fields corresponding to @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the time component of @xmath11 meson .",
    "our results show that the phase transition is of the second order consistently with the one obtained in the @xmath1 chiral lagrangian  @xcite , while it is contrary to the result in ref .",
    "it is remarkable that the chiral condensate defined by @xmath2 is almost constant in the small @xmath0 region , while it grows with @xmath0 in the large @xmath0 region .",
    "this implies that the chiral symmetry breaking is enhanced by the existence of the isospin chemical potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce some basic point of the model which we use in the present analysis . section  [ sec : pcp ] is devoted to the main part of this paper , where we study the pion condensation together with the chiral condensation . in section",

    "this model has a chiral symmetry corresponding to u(2@xmath27u(2)@xmath28 .",
    "there exists the chern - simons term in addition to the above term .",
    "however , the cs term does not contribute to the pion condensation when the spatial rotational symmetry is assumed as in this paper .",
    "the scalar field @xmath29 and the gauge fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 transform under the u@xmath32u@xmath33 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the transformation matrices of the chiral u@xmath32u@xmath33 symmetry . in the following analysis",
    "we adopt the @xmath36 gauge , and use the ir - boundary condition @xmath37 .    in the vacuum",
    "the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken down to u@xmath38 by the vacuum expectation value of @xmath29 .",

    "the values of the @xmath40 and @xmath15 together with that of @xmath10 are fixed by fitting them to the pion mass @xmath54 mev , the @xmath11 meson mass @xmath55 mev and the pion decay constant @xmath56 mev as  @xcite @xmath57 by using this value of @xmath10 and a scalar meson mass as inputs , the values of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath25 in the boundary potential are fixed .",
    "@xcite it was shown  @xcite that there is an upper bound for the scalar meson mass as @xmath58gev , but the dependence on the mass on the value of @xmath25 is small .",
    "so in the present analysis , we use the @xmath59 meson mass @xmath60 mev as a reference value , which fixes @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and see the dependence of our results on the scalar meson mass .",
    "in this section we study the pion condensation for finite isospin chemical potential @xmath0 in the holographic qcd model explained in the previous section .",
    "since the pion mass exists in the present model .",
    "we will have a phase transition from the normal phase to the pion condensation phase for increasing @xmath0 . in the present paper we are interested in the pion condensation phase for small isospin chemical potential , so that we assume that the rotational symmetry o(3 ) is not broken by e.g. the @xmath11 meson condensation .",
    "we also assume the time - independent condensate , then the vacuum structure is determined by studying the mean fields of five - dimensional fields which do not depend on the four - dimensional coordinate .",
    "we introduce the isospin chemical potential @xmath0 as a uv - boundary value of the time component of the gauge field of su(2)@xmath63 symmetry as @xmath64 where the superscript @xmath65 indicates the third component of the isospin corresponding to the neutral @xmath11 meson .",
    "the assumption of rotational invariance implies @xmath66 .",
