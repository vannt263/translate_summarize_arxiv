    "to determine the mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity , we must understand the relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity  @xcite . to date ,",
    "different classes of theoretical models for high-@xmath0 superconductivity have proposed different pseudogap phase diagrams  @xcite .",
    "that is , if the pseudogap is a necessary ingredient for pairing , the pseudogap opening temperature @xmath8 may merge with @xmath0 in the overdoped state , whereas if the pseudogap is of a competing order , @xmath8 may cross the @xmath0-dome \" near the optimal doping .",
    "the difference especially appears in the overdoped region ; hence , it is important to investigate this region .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine whether the observed effect is related to the pseudogap or the superconductivity when @xmath8 is close to @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath9 shows a typical upturn  @xcite and a negative @xmath10 slope  @xcite at high fields below @xmath8 . because @xmath11 probes the electronic density - of - states ( dos ) around the fermi level , reflecting the tunneling nature between cuo@xmath12 planes in high-@xmath0 cuprates ,",
    "the semiconductive upturn in @xmath9 is attributed to the decrease of dos caused by the pseudogap opening , and the negative @xmath10 slope is attributed to the dos recovery along with the suppression of the pseudogap under magnetic fields .",
    "these facts are well established , and thus , we can usually estimate @xmath8 by the @xmath11 behavior .    on the other hand , because superconductivity is also a phenomenon connected to the energy gap , there have been proposals from both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite points of view that superconductivity causes similar effects on @xmath11 in a temperature and magnetic field range in which the dos effect dominates over the cooper pair tunneling effect . in such cases ,",
    "it is difficult to distinguish @xmath8 from the onset temperature of the superconducting fluctuation @xmath13 . however , this interpretation for the superconductivity - originated anomalous @xmath11 behavior has not been generally accepted . to address this issue",
    ", we focus on the magnetic field dependence of @xmath11 up to high fields , especially in the superconducting fluctuation regime . in general",
    ", the pseudogap is less sensitive to magnetic fields than superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we can obtain a high enough field near the upper critical field @xmath14 , we can expect to observe the pseudogap and superconducting contributions separately for the magnetic field dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "hence , we measure @xmath15 of fe - substituted overdoped bi-2212 under high pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 t. for comparison , we also measure @xmath16 of the same sample .",
    "single crystals were grown in air using the traveling - solvent floating zone ( tsfz ) method .",
    "the bi site was partially substituted by pb to overdope the sample .",
    "the cu site was also substituted by 2% fe to reduce @xmath0 .",
    "the crystals were annealed under flowing oxygen at 400@xmath17c for 50 h to promote hole doping ( @xmath0 = 50 k , @xmath18 = 0.22 ) . in this study , @xmath0 was determined by the onset of zero resistivity . the doping level ( @xmath18 )",
    "was obtained using the empirical relation  @xcite with maximum @xmath0 = 71 k for this sample .",
    "the in - plane resistivity @xmath16 as well as the @xmath15 measurements were performed using the dc four - terminal method  @xcite .",
    "two types of magnets were used : the magnet at the institute for materials research ( imr ) , tohoku university , which provides steady magnetic fields up to 17.5 t , and the nondestructive pulsed magnet at the institute for solid state physics ( issp ) , university of tokyo , which provides pulsed magnetic fields ( 36-ms pulse duration ) up to 60 t. magnetic fields were applied parallel to the c - axis . in the pulsed magnet measurements",
    ", we did not observe hysteresis behavior in high magnetic fields above the peak field @xmath19 at which @xmath10 is maximum .",
    "furthermore , all down - ramped data coincided for measurements under several maximal fields , suggesting that the data were obtained with minimal eddy current influence .    in the following section , we will first estimate @xmath8 and @xmath13 of this sample using the temperature dependence of @xmath11 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "then , we will show that the out - of - plane magnetoconductivity ( mc ) is composed of two positive components below @xmath13 .",
    "this two component analysis enables us to estimate @xmath14 at several temperatures .",
    "we will also estimate @xmath14 from the magnetic field dependence of @xmath20 in a standard manner .",
    "consequently , an experimental @xmath21@xmath22 phase diagram of this compound will be used to validate the analysis .",
    "finally , we will discuss the implications of the obtained results for the pseudogap phase diagram .",

    "[ fig1](a ) shows an enlarged view of the out - of - plane mr at 17.5 t. the small negative mr starting below @xmath24 rapidly increases near @xmath25 .",

    "is evident , further indicating that the sample is in an overdoped state  @xcite .",
    "however , a small negative mr , whose origin is unknown , was observed above @xmath25 ( details will be published elsewhere ) .",
    "therefore , to estimate @xmath13 , we can not use our standard method of determining the onset temperature for the rapid increase of positive mr  @xcite . instead",
    ", the temperature derivative @xmath27 is compared for a zero field and a 17.5-t field ( inset of fig . [ fig1](c ) ) .",
    "the difference in @xmath27 appears below 7075 k. because the aslamazov - larkin ( al)-type superconducting fluctuation effect ( para - conductivity ) is expected to affect the slope of @xmath26 below @xmath13 , the onset temperature for the change may be assigned as @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is far greater than @xmath13 , even in this overdoped state ( @xmath18 = 0.22 )  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) shows the high pulsed magnetic field data for @xmath10 above and below @xmath25 . at 1.4 k ,",
    "@xmath10 remains at zero up to 55 t , indicating that @xmath14 is above 55 t. at other temperatures below @xmath25 , @xmath10 shows a typical peak structure ; it changes from zero to a resistive state at a vortex melting field , @xmath28 , reaching a maximum at @xmath19 before decreasing to a constant value .",
    "this peak structure in @xmath10 can be understood by parallel two - channel tunneling conductivity  @xcite : cooper pair tunneling , @xmath29 , and quasiparticle tunneling , @xmath30 .",
    "that is , @xmath10 = 1/(@xmath29 + @xmath30 ) .",
    "the behavior under weak magnetic fields is controlled by @xmath29 , which arises due to phase slips between neighboring cuo@xmath4 planes caused by the motion of mobile pancake vortices , and the josephson contribution decreases with increasing field strength  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath30 increases under high magnetic fields , causing a negative @xmath10 slope , and @xmath19 is a crossover field for both contributions . in the following section , we concentrate on the analysis of the negative @xmath10 slope .",
    "we consider @xmath31 above @xmath25 .",
    "figures [ fig2](b)(c ) show the mc , @xmath32 = @xmath33 , as a function of @xmath34 , at 50 and 60 k , respectively . above 65 k",
    ", we additionally measure the mc using a steady magnet up to 16 t ( fig . [",
    "fig2](d ) ) . the",
    "mc rapidly increases with increasing magnetic fields , approaching @xmath35 for higher fields . with increasing temperature ,",
    "the field interval mc , which follows @xmath35 , extends to lower fields , and the slope , @xmath36 , decreases .",
    "these data imply that the mc comprises two positive components : one component gradually increases with @xmath37 ( hereafter , we denote this component as @xmath38 ) , and the other component rapidly increases with increasing magnetic field but tends to saturate at higher fields ( hereafter , we denote this component as @xmath39 ) .",
    "this two component analysis is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](e ) .",
    "figure [ fig2](d ) shows that the @xmath34 component , @xmath38 , is present both below and above @xmath13 , while the component with a different ( faster ) @xmath21-dependence , @xmath39 , decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes around @xmath13 ( = 75 k ) .",
    "thus , the former component ( @xmath38 ) is attributed to the pseudogap effect , and the latter component ( @xmath39 ) is attributed to the superconducting dos depletion effect .",
    "this result verifies that the positive superconducting contribution in mc appears below @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the observation of @xmath34 mc at high temperatures above @xmath13 ( when superconducting fluctuations are presumably gone ) justifies the following analysis in figs .",
    "[ fig2](b)(d ) , which separate the pseudogap components from its @xmath34 dependence .",
    "this two component analysis enables us to estimate the weight of the superconducting contribution , @xmath40 , for the total quasiparticle tunneling mc . the saturated value of @xmath39 is given by the @xmath41-intercepts , @xmath42 , of the high field @xmath34-linear behavior as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](e ) .",
    "the total quasiparticle contributions , @xmath43 = @xmath44 , are given by @xmath45 of the figure .",
    "then , we can estimate @xmath40 = @xmath46 , by @xmath47 . at 50 k ,",
    "@xmath40 is estimated as @xmath48 at 55 t. the estimated value is reliable in that it can be obtained directly from the raw mc data . considering that the data are obtained at @xmath25 , this value is fairly large .",
    "furthermore , the field at which @xmath39 saturates is used to determine @xmath14 .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is estimated as 41 , 22 , 13 , 12 , and 10 t at 50 , 60 , 65 , 70 , and 75 k , respectively .",
    "however , @xmath38 does not saturate even under high fields up to 55 t. this indicates that the field needed to close the pseudogap , @xmath49  @xcite , is very high ( far greater than 55 t ) .",
    "next , we consider @xmath31 below @xmath25 . here , the @xmath31 behavior [ positive @xmath31 slope ] above @xmath25 is continuously observed above @xmath19 . however , in this case , as mc does not exhibit @xmath34 behavior for whole fields , it is difficult to estimate the pseudogap contribution directly from the mc data . therefore , we assume it from the data above @xmath25 . figure [ fig3](a ) shows the @xmath36 values obtained in figs . [ fig2](b)(d ) for the pseudogap contribution above @xmath25 .",
    "the accuracy of the data is not sufficient to determine the precise functional form ( either sublinear or superlinear ) for the temperature dependence of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the @xmath36 value near @xmath25 was simply assumed to be linear in temperature .",
    "note that this is an approximation near @xmath25 to estimate @xmath36 in the superconducting state . at higher temperatures ( @xmath50 80 k )",
    ", the slope becomes smaller , and the @xmath36 value approaches zero at around @xmath24 = 170 k. figure [ fig3](b ) and ( c ) show the magnetic field dependence of @xmath51 at 40 and 30 k , respectively . to determine only the superconducting contribution to the data , the above pseudogap contribution is subtracted from the raw data .",
    "we find that the pseudogap contribution is not very large . in this case",
    ", @xmath14 may correspond to the field at which the superconducting @xmath51 is extrapolated to zero .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is estimated as 51 and 60 t for 40 and 30 k , respectively .",
    "we then investigate the weight of superconducting contribution @xmath40 below @xmath25 .",
    "for this purpose , the magnetic field dependences of @xmath52 and @xmath52 - @xmath38 are plotted in figs .",

    "then , @xmath52 - @xmath38 is expressed as @xmath39 + @xmath55t@xmath56 . assuming that @xmath55t@xmath56 at 20 k is negligible , the result in fig .",
    "[ fig3](f ) implies that @xmath40 accounts for @xmath57 80 @xmath58 of the total mc .",

    "with increasing magnetic fields , @xmath61 changes from zero to a resistive state at @xmath28 and rapidly increases in a similar manner as @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "it then gradually approaches a constant value , keeping a positive slope .",
    "this in - plane behavior contrasts the out - of - plane behavior , in which @xmath10 shows a typical negative slope at higher fields , indicating that , in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , we have succeeded in detecting a property peculiar to @xmath10 .",
    "the superconducting fluctuation theory  @xcite including the dos contribution in highly anisotropic materials predicts that , for the out - of - plane conduction , the negative dos contribution dominates over the positive aslamazov - larkin ( al ) contribution near @xmath14 , resulting in a negative slope for @xmath10 . for the in - plane conduction , the al contribution dominates , causing the positive slope for @xmath61 .",
    "the experimental observations in this study are consistent with this theory .",

    "the fitting to the experimental data is very good between 4.2 k to 15 k , probably better than that of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the fitting gives @xmath63 = 70 t. the extrapolation of @xmath19 to 0  k gives @xmath19 = 69 t ; here , we assumed @xmath19 at low temperatures is exponential in @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath63 is directly estimated as 70 t by fitting the obtained @xmath67 using the empirical formula @xmath68 ; here , we assumed the @xmath13 value ( = 75 k ) for @xmath25 . all three superconductivity - related characteristic fields roughly coincide at @xmath22 = 0 , indicating that the obtained @xmath67 contain information on the upper critical field .",

    ", we have revealed that the superconducting contribution to the positive slope for the out - of - plane mc evolves below @xmath13 in addition to the pseudogap contribution .",
    "this result , on one hand , confirms that the pseudogap and superconductivity are distinct , as many authors suggest  @xcite . on the other hand , this result verifies that superconductivity is another cause for the anomalous @xmath71 behavior .",
    "recently , we have observed a pseudogap - like upturn and negative mr in @xmath71 just above @xmath0 for heavily overdoped bi-2212",
    "( @xmath18 = 0.23 )  @xcite .",
    "thus , this behavior should be attributed to superconductivity ; the pseudogap does not open above @xmath0 in this doping state .",
    "therefore , if we could know whether or not the pseudogap opens below @xmath25 in this heavily overdoped sample , we would understand the pseudogap phase diagram completely .",
    "in summary , to determine the origin of the positive slope in interlayer mc in high-@xmath0 cuprates , @xmath15 as well as @xmath16 measurements under high pulsed magnetic fields were performed on pb and fe co - doped bi-2212 .",
    "the results not only establish that the positive mc and the correlated upturn for @xmath72 near @xmath0 are a sign of superconductivity but also enable us to estimate @xmath14 and the superconducting contribution on the positive mc quantitatively .",
