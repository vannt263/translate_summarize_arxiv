    "because the neutral ( @xmath4 ) members of the @xmath5 octet of vector currents , @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 the usual gell - mann matrices ) , couple to fermions in the standard model , it is possible to use experimental data on the spectral functions associated with correlators involving these currents to determine certain quantities of phenomenological interest .",
    "for example , defining the scalar correlators , @xmath8 , by means of @xmath9 and the corresponding spectral functions , @xmath10 , as usual , by @xmath11 , one finds that ( 1 ) integrating the difference @xmath12 with the weight function occuring naturally ( due to kinematics ) in the finite energy sum rule ( fesr ) treatment of hadronic @xmath13 decays@xcite produces a sum rule from which one can , in principle , determine the running strange quark mass , @xmath14@xcite , and ( 2 ) integrating the same difference @xmath12 with weight function @xmath15 produces a sum rule from which one can extract one of the @xmath2 order low - energy constants ( lec s ) , @xmath3 , appearing in the @xmath2 order version of the effective chiral lagrangian@xcite .",

    "@xcite for a discussion of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and the method of effective chiral lagrangians in general , ref .",

    "@xcite for both a discussion of the subset of these terms surviving when one restricts one s attention to vacuum correlators , and a definition of @xmath3 . )    of course , @xmath17 and @xmath18 do not couple separately in the standard model , but only in the combination @xmath19 which gives the light quark ( @xmath20 ) part of the electromagnetic ( em ) current .",
    "thus , what is measured in @xmath21 , is not the desired quantities , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , separately , but the combination @xmath24 in the isospin symmetry limit , @xmath25 would vanish and , since one could then classify the final hadronic states according to their g - parity , it would be straightforward to separate the isovector ( @xmath26 ) and isoscalar ( @xmath27 ) components of the em spectral function .    in the presence of isospin breaking , however , this process is no longer so straightforward .",
    "the most obvious experimental signature of the presence of isospin - breaking in @xmath21 is the interference shoulder in the @xmath28 cross - section in the @xmath29-@xmath30 region@xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 contribution to @xmath32 is clearly , to leading order in isospin - breaking , to be associated with @xmath25 and hence is usually removed explicitly in analyzing the data .",
    "this removal is accomplished by ( 1 ) fitting the parameters of a model for the total @xmath28 amplitude , consisting of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and possible background contributions , to the experimental data , ( 2 ) removing the @xmath30 contribution once the fit has been performed and ( 3 ) squaring the modulus of the remaining @xmath29 contribution and identifying this result with the @xmath29 contribution to @xmath22@xcite .",
    "while this procedure _ does _ remove one source of isospin breaking contamination from the nominal @xmath22 so extracted , it is easy to see that other such contaminations still remain . indeed ,",
    "once one allows isospin - breaking , the physical @xmath29 and @xmath30 are admixtures of pure isovector and isoscalar states , the size of the admixture of the `` wrong '' isospin component being governed by the scale of isospin breaking . as a consequence , the intermediate @xmath29 contribution to @xmath25 ,",
    "for example , does not vanish .",
    "in fact , if one denotes the pure isovector @xmath29 state by @xmath33 and the pure isoscalar @xmath30 state by @xmath34 , one expects @xmath29 contributions to @xmath25 from two sources : ( 1 ) that due to @xmath33-@xmath34 mixing ( a one particle reducible contribution , with coupling of the isovector current to the @xmath33 component and the isoscalar current to the @xmath34 component of the @xmath29 ) , and ( 2 ) that due to the `` direct '' ( one particle irreducible , @xmath35 ) coupling of the @xmath33 component to the isoscalar current ( such a coupling being unavoidable in any hadronic effective lagrangian based on qcd ) .",
    "thus , removing the contribution due to the intermediate state @xmath30 from the @xmath28 cross - section , while removing part of the @xmath25 contribution , does not remove it all .",
    "one is then left with , _ not _ the desired quantity , @xmath22 , but rather with a combination of @xmath22 and the residual part of @xmath25 associated with the intermediate @xmath29 state ( plus possible additional such contaminations from elsewhere in the spectrum ) .",
    "similar isospin - breaking flavor @xmath36 contributions exist for @xmath37 , complicating the extraction of the isoscalar spectral function .",
    "corrections for such isospin breaking effects , _ which are unavoidable so long as no process exists in which only one of the two neutral flavor currents couples _ , are thus necessary if one wishes to perform phenomenological analyses of the type mentioned above .",
    "such corrections would also be important in performing precision tests of cvc , which involve a comparison of @xmath22 and the charged isovector spectral function @xmath38 , measured in hadronic @xmath13 decays ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to see that , to be able to make these corrections ( at least in the region below @xmath39 gev@xmath40 , where the em spectral function is , experimentally , resonance dominated ) , it is sufficient to determine the isospin - breaking vector meson decay constants",
    ". let us first clarify notation .",
    "we define the flavor @xmath41 and @xmath42 vector meson decay constants via @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the vector meson polarization vector , and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are non - zero in the limit of isospin symmetry ; @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 zero in the absence of isospin breaking .",
    "the experimentally determined em decay constants , @xmath52 , are then given by @xmath53 thus , for example , the broad @xmath29 contribution to @xmath32 , usually taken to be associated purely with @xmath22 , consists not only of a flavor @xmath26 contribution proportional to @xmath54 ^ 2 $ ] , but also of a flavor @xmath36 contribution proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath30 contribution to @xmath32 , similarly , contains both a flavor @xmath27 part proportional to @xmath56 ^ 2 $ ] and a flavor @xmath36 part proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "the flavor @xmath36 parts , in both cases , are present only due to isospin breaking , and have to be removed from the experimental @xmath29 and @xmath30 contributions to @xmath32 in order to obtain the corresponding @xmath29 contribution to @xmath22 and @xmath30 contribution to @xmath23 .",
    "it is important to stress at this point that the conventional `` few - percent '' rule - of - thumb for estimating the size of isospin - breaking effects , which might lead one to expect such effects to be numerically negligible , is inapplicable in the cases involving @xmath12 discussed above .",
    "this is true for a number of reasons .",
    "first , because the difference of spectral functions is itself flavor - breaking , the _ relative _ importance of isospin breaking is enhanced by a factor @xmath58 , characteristic of the inverse of the scale of flavor - breaking .",
    "second , the effect of @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing naturally produces corrections for the @xmath29 contribution to @xmath22 and @xmath30 contribution to @xmath23 which are opposite in sign ; the effects therefore add when the difference is taken .",
    "finally , there is a natural numerical enhancement which makes the size of the correction needed to remove the @xmath25 part of the @xmath30 contribution to @xmath32 , and hence isolate @xmath23 , larger than naively expected@xcite .",
    "the latter two points are discussed in somewhat more detail in section ii below .    in what follows ,",
    "we evaluate the isospin - breaking vector meson decay constants by performing a qcd sum rule analysis of the isospin - breaking vector current correlator @xmath59 .",
    "the vector meson spectral contributions are , in this case , proportional to @xmath60 , so that a determination of this product , in combination with the experimental determination of @xmath52 , given in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath62 above , allows a separate determination of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss qualitative expectations for the pattern of isospin - breaking corrections based on the structure of the leading ( chiral ) order terms in the vector meson effective chiral lagrangian , as well as semi - quantitative expectations for their probable scale which can , using this perspective , be obtained from experimental data . in section iii , we discuss briefly the form of qcd sum rules employed ( a version of fesr ) , and the advantages of this approach . in section iv , we discuss the input used for the hadronic and ope sides of the sum rules employed , and present our results . some advantages of the approach , in particular _",
    "viz a vis _ the handling of the @xmath1 terms in the ope of the @xmath36 correlator , will also be discussed here . finally , in section",
    "v we summarize , and make some brief comments on the phenomenological significance of our results .",
    "chpt provides both an underlying conceptual framework and systematic procedure@xcite for writing down the most general effective lagrangian relevant to a given set of hadronic states which fully incorporates the symmetries of qcd and implements the broken symmetries ( such as chiral symmetry ) with the same pattern of symmetry breaking as occurs in qcd . although the resulting effective lagrangian , @xmath63 , is non - renormalizable , and hence contains a infinite number of low - energy constants ( lec s ) ( coefficients of those terms allowed by the symmetry arguments that go into constructing @xmath63 ) , it is possible to formulate the theory in such a way that only a finite number of such terms appear to a given order in the chiral , or low - energy expansion .",
    "( for so - called `` heavy '' fields , those whose masses are non - vanishing in the chiral limit , this requires a re - formulation in terms of velocity - dependent fields@xcite . ) the leading order terms in this expansion ( in which light quark masses , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , count as @xmath66 , with @xmath67 representing some soft external momentum ) , incorporate the leading constraints associated either with chiral symmetry , or the symmetry pattern of its breaking .    the heavy field implementation of chpt given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the vector mesons and their interactions with the members of the pseudo - goldstone boson pseudoscalar octet provides some useful information about the pattern of isospin - breaking mixing in the vector meson sector .",
    "one must bear in mind that , in general , mixing in field theory is more complicated than in hamiltonian quantum mechanics .",
    "this is because , in an effective field theory , one in general has ( and can not , in fact , avoid ) momentum - dependent mixing terms .",
    "this means that there are off - diagonal elements of the wave - function renormalization matrix and , as a consequence , the relation between the original , unmixed fields and the final , renormalized and diagonalized fields , involves the product of a symmetric matrix and a rotation ( and hence is not itself a rotation ) .",
    "( see , for example , the discussion of the effects of @xmath68-@xmath69 mixing in ref .",
    "@xcite ; an expanded version is also given as part of the discussion of the treatment of the mixed - isospin axial current correlator in ref .  @xcite . ) from the heavy vector meson field formulation , however , one sees that the leading ( in chiral order ) term in @xmath63 generating isospin - breaking mixing involves one power of the quark mass matrix and no derivatives@xcite , and hence produces no off - diagonal contributions to the wave - function renormalization matrix .",
    "the _ leading order _ mixing effect thus results in a physical @xmath29 and @xmath30 basis which is related by a rotation to the original pure isospin @xmath33 , @xmath34 basis , just as in the quantum mechanical case .",
    "the `` wrong '' isospin @xmath34 admixture in the physical @xmath29 state is thus equal in magnitude , but opposite in sign , to that of the @xmath33 admixture in the physical @xmath30 state , at this order in the chiral expansion .",
    "while higher ( chiral ) order corrections exist , this pattern should remain approximately valid , even at higher order .",
    "let us now consider the vector meson decay constants . since the chiral limit is also @xmath5 symmetric , the leading order term generating the vector meson decay constants is necessarily @xmath5-symmetric .",
    "when one now considers the effects of flavor- and isospin - symmetry breaking ( recalling that both are generated by the quark mass matrix , and hence both are produced by the same set of terms in the effective lagrangian ) , there are two potential sources of flavor and isospin breaking in the vector meson decay constants .",
    "the first is that associated with higher order terms , involving at least one power of the quark mass matrix , coupling the external photon field to the vector meson nonet , the second that induced by the leading quark - mass - dependent term , responsible for mixing , discussed above .",
    "the leading order mixing effect simply reproduces the standard leading order @xmath5 mixing analysis@xcite , leading to near ideal mixing in the vector meson sector .",
    "as is well - known , the combination of ideal mixing and neglect of flavor - breaking in the em couplings of the unmixed states leads to the prediction that the vector meson em decay constants , measured experimentally in @xmath70,@xcite should be in the proportions @xmath71 , where the superscript @xmath72 indicates that the couplings refer to the ideally mixed , but isospin pure vector meson states . that this prediction is borne out by experiment",
    "represents empirical evidence that , despite the potential @xmath5-breaking photon coupling contributions being of the same formal order as effects induced by mixing , the former are numerically suppressed relative to the latter .",
    "since flavor breaking and isospin breaking are generated by the same terms in the effective lagrangian , this implies that isospin breaking in the vector meson decay constants should also be dominated by mixing effects .",
    "if we take this point of view then , up to sub - leading corrections , we find , for the physical @xmath29 and @xmath30 decay constants , now including isospin breaking and taking into account the relation @xmath73 , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the leading order mixing angle , defined via @xmath76 we note two relevant features of these results : ( 1 ) because of the dominance by mixing , the corrections required to convert the pure isovector @xmath77 coupling to the experimental @xmath78 coupling is opposite in sign to that required to convert the pure isoscalar @xmath79 coupling to the @xmath80 and , ( 2 ) because of the pattern of ideal mixing and the numerical suppression of the isoscalar current relative to the isovector current in @xmath81 , the magnitude of the correction is a factor of @xmath82 larger in the @xmath30 than in the @xmath29 case .",
    "this does not mean that , somehow , isospin breaking has become huge in the @xmath30 case , but rather reflects the expected natural suppression of the @xmath30 coupling relative to that of the @xmath29 , which is confirmed by experiment .",
    "in general , but particularly in light of the large numerical enhancement just discussed , it is crucial to find a means of estimating the isospin - breaking contributions to the vector meson em decay constants . in view of the discussion above , although there exist additional effects beyond those associated with mixing at leading order , one can get a rough idea of the size expected for the isospin - breaking vector meson decay constants by considering experimental information on @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing , and ignoring all non - mixing effects .",
    "although crude , this estimate provides an additional qualitative constraint for our later sum rule analysis .    in order to obtain the parameter @xmath75 describing @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing at leading order , it is sufficient to determine the off - diagonal element , @xmath83 , of the vector meson self - energy matrix . in the past ,",
    "values for @xmath83 in the range @xmath84 mev@xmath40 have been quoted , based on simplified analyses of @xmath28 data in the interference region which effectively assume that the one - particle irreducible @xmath85 vertex is zero , even in the presence of isospin breaking . since effective operators which generate such a coupling exist in the vector meson effective lagrangian , however , this assumption is unphysical ( in the sense of being incompatible with qcd ) .",
    "once one includes contributions to the @xmath86 amplitude generated both by @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing _ and _ the 1pi vertex ( whose strength we will denote by @xmath87 ) , the analysis of the experimental data is somewhat more complicated but , in principle , allows a separate determination of both @xmath83 and the isospin - breaking ratio of couplings of the isospin pure states @xmath88@xcite .    an important feature of the analysis framework developed in ref .",
    "@xcite is that , from it , one understands that the smallness of previously quoted errors for @xmath83 is an artifact of the unphysical assumption @xmath89 , and does not survive the more general treatment .",
    "it is worth outlining the reason why this is the case since , in doing so , it will become clear that it is a difficult task to improve the experimental situation sufficiently to really pin down the mixing contribution .    the contribution of the _ physical _",
    "( i.e. , mixed - isospin ) @xmath30 to the amplitude for @xmath28 is obtained experimentally by determining the timelike pion form factor , @xmath90 , in the interference region and fitting it to a form @xmath91 \\ , + \\ , { \\rm background } \\label{fpi}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 are the complex pole positions , @xmath93 , and the fit parameter , @xmath94 , is known as the `` orsay phase '' . the @xmath30 contribution in eq .",
    "( [ fpi ] ) is generated by the coupling of the physical @xmath30 to @xmath95 which , as discussed above , has two sources : 1pr ( @xmath33-@xmath34 mixing ) , and 1pi ( associated with the @xmath96 vertex ) .",
    "the physical coupling is given , in terms of these contributions , by @xmath97 where , as usual , the superscript @xmath72 indicates couplings of the unmixed isospin pure states .",
    "in the ( physically plausible ) approximation that one assumes saturation of the imaginary part of @xmath83 by @xmath98 intermediate states , one finds @xmath99 and hence , in the narrow @xmath29-@xmath30 interference region , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is now real .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath75 is then given by@xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 one then finds , upon substitution of eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ gomega ] ) , that @xmath104 \\ , g^{(0)}_{\\rho\\pi\\pi}\\ . \\label{renard}\\ ] ]    in many places in the literature , one finds the approximation @xmath105 employed .",
    "the deviation of the quantity @xmath106 from @xmath107 represents the error made in employing this approximation .",
    "since @xmath108 and @xmath109 is small ( @xmath110 to @xmath111 ) , one might think it rather safe to set @xmath112 in the above analysis ( this approximation was , in fact , made uniformly in analyses previous to the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . if it were true that this approximation were reliable , then the effect of @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ renard ] ) would cancel exactly@xcite , and the experimental data would determine the real part of @xmath83 in the interference region with the usually quoted errors ( @xmath114 mev@xmath40 ; see ref .",
    "@xcite and earlier references cited therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that the approximation is both misleading and unreliable .",
    "the reason is that , although @xmath106 is approximately real and near @xmath107 , @xmath115 is dominantly imaginary . since the denominator of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ renard ] ) is also dominantly imaginary , the two terms add nearly constructively . were the phases of these terms to be actually identical , of course , it would be impossible to use experimental information to separate them , no matter how precise that data .",
    "fortunately , there is a small phase difference which , at least in principle , means that a determination , with sufficient accuracy , of both the magnitude , @xmath116 , and phase , @xmath94 , of the @xmath30 contribution to @xmath117 , would allow separate determination of @xmath113 and @xmath101 . from this",
    ", one would be able to reconstruct @xmath83 and hence determine @xmath75 .",
    "there is , however , a practical difficulty , which limits the accuracy obtainable using present experimental data .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the phase difference of the two terms is not large , so one is rather close to being in the `` identical phase '' situation , for which a separate extraction of the two terms would be impossible . if one takes the updated numerical analyses of ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , one sees that values of @xmath101 between @xmath118 and @xmath119 mev@xmath40 are allowed by present data ( with a central value @xmath120 mev@xmath40 ) , and that , while the central extraction for @xmath113 is moderately large @xmath121 , @xmath89 is only @xmath122 distant .",
    "a significant improvement in this situation would require a significant reduction of the errors in the determination of the orsay phase .",
    "unfortunately , the prospects for seeing such an improvement in the near future are remote , at present .",
    "although , with present experimental accuracy , the errors in the determination of @xmath75 are disappointingly large , we can , nonetheless , as explained above , use the range of values obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite to help set a rough scale for the expected size of those corrections required to go from @xmath78 to @xmath123 , and @xmath80 to @xmath124 . using the central values for the four fits given in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds that @xmath123 is _ less than",
    "_ @xmath78 by between @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( the former corresponding to fixing @xmath89 by hand , the latter to the mow and a solutions contained in the table of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath124 _ greater than",
    "_ @xmath80 by between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we will see that the solutions obtained below via the sum rule analysis satisfy these rather loose constraints , and , in fact , provide an alternate determination which is to be favored since it both has considerably smaller errors and is free of the uncertainties associated with effectively truncating at leading chiral order ( which goes into the estimate just discussed ) .",
    "as is well - known , the properties of unitarity and analyticity lead to the existence of various ( appropriately subtracted ) dispersion relations for typical hadronic correlators , @xmath129 . by the term `` dispersion relations '' we mean here both those relations based on the cauchy representation theorem , and those based on cauchy s theorem ( the vanishing of the integral of an analytic function over a closed contour entirely in the region of analyticity ) .",
    "the generic term `` qcd sum rules '' describes those versions of these relations obtained by making kinematic restrictions which allow one to take advantage of the asymptotic freedom of qcd . in the first case ,",
    "one simply writes the representation theorem for @xmath129 with @xmath130 large and spacelike ; in the second , a choice of the integration contour is made so that at least part of the contour lies in the region of large spacelike momenta . in either case , the point of the kinematic restriction is to take advantage of the fact that , in the region of large spacelike momenta , computational techniques based on the operator product expansion ( ope)/perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) are applicable .    the generic form of the sum rules generated using the representation theorem is then , up to possible subtractions , @xmath131 where the @xmath132 is the lowest physical threshold in the channel in question and the spectral function , @xmath29 , is defined as usual by @xmath133 .",
    "the lhs is to be computed using the ope / pqcd , while the rhs is given in terms of measured spectral data and/or some spectral anstz ( involving a limited number of unknown parameters ) for the unmeasured part of the spectral function .",
    "as first pointed out by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov ( svz)@xcite , the utility of such relations is greatly improved by borel transformation .",
    "the effect of the borel transform is ( 1 ) to replace the weight @xmath134 in the hadronic spectral integral on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ normsr ] ) with @xmath135 , where @xmath136 , the borel mass , is a parameter of the transformation , ( 2 ) to kill all subtraction terms and ( 3 ) to create a factorial suppression of the contributions of higher dimensional operators on the ope side of the equation ( @xmath137 ) . ideally , on the hadronic side",
    ", one would like to choose @xmath136 as small as possible , in order to suppress the contributions from the large-@xmath138 part of the integral , for which the spectral function will typically be complicated , and difficult to model .",
    "in contrast , to improve the convergence of the ope when truncated at operators of relatively low dimension , one wants @xmath136 as large as possible . to be usable",
    ", svz sum rules thus require a compromise : one must hope to find a `` stability window '' in @xmath136 , i.e. , a region of @xmath136 values for which both contributions from the complicated part of the spectral distribution ( on the hadronic side ) and from the highest dimension operators ( on the ope side ) are not too large .",
    "typically , because of the compromise nature of the choice of stability window , this means that neither the contributions from the large-@xmath138 part of the spectrum , nor that from the highest dimension operator retained on the ope side , are negligible@xcite .",
    "for the case of sum rules based on cauchy s theorem , a common choice of integration contour ( and the one we will employ in the analysis below ) is that shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the radius , @xmath139 , of the circular part of the contour is to be taken large enough that the ope , to the order available , is reliable in the spacelike region of the circle .",
    "the resulting sum rule is then generically of the form @xmath140 where @xmath141 is any function of @xmath130 analytic in the region of integration , and @xmath142 denotes the circular part of the contour , traversed counterclockwise ( from above to below the cut ) .",
    "the ope is then to be used on @xmath142 ( see also the discussion to follow ) , while spectral data and/or a spectral anstz is to be employed in the `` hadronic '' integral on the rhs .",
    "such sum rules are called , generically , finite energy sum rules ( fesr s ) , and have usually been employed with integer - power weights ( @xmath143 , with @xmath144)@xcite , though the standard theoretical treatment of hadronic @xmath13 decays , which is of the fesr type , involves a more complicated weight , as determined by kinematics@xcite .",
    "it is useful , for the discussion which follows , to recall at this point the distinction between `` local '' and `` semi - local '' duality . for a typical hadronic correlator , @xmath129 , as above",
    ", the ope is expected to be reliable , not only for @xmath130 large and spacelike , but also for those @xmath130 on any circle of sufficiently large radius in the complex @xmath130-plane , apart possibly from some region whose size is hadronic in scale about the timelike real axis ( where the effects of confinement are expected to be important)@xcite . the term `` local duality '' , in this context , refers to the postulate ( underlying , for example , all statements giving the number of subtractions required to make a given dispersion relation convergent in qcd ) that , once one is in a region @xmath145 for which the separation between adjacent resonances is small compared to the typical resonance width , the region of validity of the ope on the circle of radius @xmath139 extends all the way down to the real timelike axis .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the hadronic spectral function can then be calculated using the ope .",
    "this is what allows , for example , the hadroproduction ratio , @xmath146 , in @xmath147 scattering to be computed theoretically in the asymptotic region using perturbative methods .",
    "similarly , `` semi - local duality '' refers to the idea that , at somewhat lower ( `` intermediate '' ) scales , where local duality is no longer valid , nonetheless , averaged over some range of ( timelike ) momenta , the mean values given by using either the actual hadronic spectral function or the ope version thereof should be the same .",
    "it is important to understand that , empirically , the condition that resonance spacing be _ much smaller _ than typical resonance widths is crucial to the validity of local duality .",
    "indeed , one can test local duality through the application of various fesr s in the case of the isovector vector channel , for which the hadronic spectral function is very accurately measured in hadronic @xmath13 decays@xcite .",
    "one finds that , even at scales as large as @xmath148 gev@xmath40 , and even though the experimental spectral function appears rather featureless in this region , nonetheless , local duality is rather poorly satisfied@xcite .",
    "( note that in this channel , at these scales , the separation of resonances is comparable to their widths . )    in light of the above discussion , we distinguish three ( timelike ) kinematic regimes : `` low '' ( the region of narrow , well - isolated resonances ) , `` intermediate '' ( the region of the validity of semi - local duality ) and `` high '' ( the region of the validity of local duality , for which the hadronic spectral function can be reliably obtained using pqcd / ope methods ) .",
    "the distinction is important because of the ways , described above , in which sum rules are practically implemented .",
    "typically , one attempts to use known information , contained in the ope ( i.e. , @xmath149 , and the values of various vacuum condensates ) , to place constraints on the parameters of the ( hopefully , physically - motivated ) anstz for the corresponding unknown ( or not fully - known ) spectral function .",
    "this attempt will , of course , be successful only if ( 1 ) one is able to work at scales for which the ope , truncated at operators of relatively low dimension , and at a given perturbative order for the wilson coefficients of these operators , is well - converged , and ( 2 ) one has a _ qualitative _ form for the hadronic spectral anstz which is both physically plausible and does not involve a large number of unknown parameters .",
    "the latter condition can , realistically , be satisfied only if the scale up to which one needs the spectral anstz is not too far into the intermediate region .",
    "once the higher resonances start to overlap , and various multiparticle background processes start to become important , the general form of the spectral function will become increasingly difficult to anticipate in advance ( until , that is , one is at sufficiently large scales that local duality finally becomes valid ) .    in the svz version of qcd sum rules , as explained above , it is only rarely possible to choose the stability window for the analysis in such a way as to avoid contributions from the region where either one does not know the qualitative form of the spectral function , or where , even if one does , to implement it fully would involve the use of more free parameters than could be determined reliably , given the limited amount of information available in the truncated ope@xcite .",
    "conventionally , this problem is dealt with by employing a spectral anstz in which ( 1 ) the low-@xmath138 region is assumed to be dominated by one or two low - lying resonance contributions and ( 2 ) the intermediate- and high-@xmath138 region is approximated using the local duality version of the spectral function , which one assumes to start at some `` continuum threshold '' , @xmath139 .",
    "it is well - known that this form of `` continuum anstz '' represents a rather crude approximation , and hence can create significant uncertainties in the analysis if the contributions from the continuum part of the spectral integral are large for @xmath136 values in the stability window .",
    "typically , one attempts to minimize this problem by avoiding @xmath136 values for which this is the case , but the cost of doing so is poorer convergence on the ope side of the sum rule and hence increased uncertainties associated with neglect of higher dimension contributions .    a similar problem exists for the integer - power weighted version of fesr s .",
    "one advantage of the fesr approach is that , in contrast to the svz method , the choice of scale appearing on the ope side of the sum rule ( @xmath139 ) is not constrained by the requirement of working in a stability window .",
    "one is , of course , still forced to choose @xmath139 not too far into the intermediate region , since otherwise the spectral anstz would be too complicated to allow a reliable analysis .",
    "the possibility of working at such intermediate scales in the fesr approach can , nonetheless , represent a practical advantage over the svz approach in certain cases .",
    "this is true of those channels for which the stability window of the svz analysis lies at relatively low @xmath136 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath150 gev@xmath40 , as found for many applications in the literature ) . in such cases ,",
    "the larger scale of the fesr analysis leads to an improvement of both the convergence by operator dimension and convergence by perturbative order of the wilson coefficients on the ope side of the sum rule .",
    "unfortunately , this advantage is usually more than offset by an increase in the difficulties associated with the use of the local duality approximation in the intermediate region .",
    "the reason is obvious : with integer - power weights , the region near the timelike real axis where the circular part of the contour joins the cut , does not have the exponential suppression present for the `` continuum '' contributions in the svz approach .",
    "the problems that result can be quantified in the case of the isovector vector channel , where the hadronic spectral function is known experimentally . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the errors in integer - power weighted fesr s , even at scales as high as @xmath151 , can be very large , despite the fact that the ope at this scale is both dominated by the leading ( @xmath152 ) perturbative term , and rather rapidly converging .",
    "( a more detailed discussion of why it is that one can not judge the degree of validity of the local duality approximation simply by looking at the degree of convergence of the ope in a given region is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "these problems , encountered in employing the conventional , integer - power - weighted version of fesr s , are , however , not intrinsic to the fesr approach .",
    "indeed , there is at least one example of a non - integer - power - weighted fesr that is very well - satisfied : that giving the hadronic @xmath13 decay widths in terms of an integral over the circle of radius @xmath153 of the product of the ope for the isovector vector current correlator and the weight function @xmath154 ( where the dominant input parameter in the ope representation is @xmath155 , which can be taken as obtained by running the value measured at the @xmath156 mass down to the @xmath13 scale ) .",
    "the reason for the success of this sum rule is well - known : the juncture of the cut and circular portions of the fesr contour corresponds to the edge of hadronic phase space and hence , because of kinematics , the weight function @xmath157 has a ( double ) zero at @xmath158",
    ". this zero suppresses contributions from the portion of the circular part of the contour near the real timelike axis for which the ope representation of the correlator is not reliable ( at intermediate scales like @xmath151)@xcite .",
    "this immediately suggests that the appropriate way to implement fesr s in other channels is , not with integer - power weights , but rather with weights having a zero at @xmath159 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , in the isovector vector channel , where one can check the procedure explicitly , weight functions of either the form @xmath160 having a single zero at @xmath159 , or @xmath161 having a double zero at @xmath159 , produce extremely well - satisfied fesr s for a wide range of values of @xmath139 and the continuous parameter , @xmath116 .",
    "in addition , using _ only _ the ope representation , for a range of @xmath116 and @xmath139 , and fitting the parameters of a sum - of - resonances anstz to this representation , results in a very good reconstruction of the hadronic spectral function , including a determination of the @xmath29 decay constant accurate to within a few @xmath162@xcite . in order to have a compact terminology for use in describing the weight families in eqs .",
    "( [ singlepinch ] ) and ( [ doublepinch ] ) , we will refer to @xmath163 and @xmath164 as single - pinch and double - pinch weights , respectively .",
    "the freedom to vary @xmath116 plays a role analogous to that of the variation of @xmath136 within the stability window in an svz - style analysis , in that it strengthens the sum rule constraints on the parameters of the spectral anstz by working with a range of different weight profiles .",
    "an additional advantage , at least if one wishes to determine not just the parameters of the lowest resonance in the channel but also those associated with higher resonances , is that the weight function can actually be arranged to be larger in the second resonance region than in the first .    in what follows , in light of its success in the isovector vector channel , we will employ the fesr framework , using both the single- and double - pinch weight families , to investigate the isospin - breaking vector current correlator , @xmath59 , defined above . as usual in the fesr framework , we will work at scales as high as possible , compatible with the constraint of having a tractable and physically sensible spectral anstz for @xmath165 .",
    "since little is known about the vector meson resonance spectrum beyond the second excited resonance region , and since including even the second excited resonance region would lead to a spectral anstz with more parameters than are generally tractable for the present analysis , we are forced to work at scales no higher than @xmath166 gev@xmath40 . since the separation of the first and second excited vector meson resonance regions is comparable to the resonance widths ( the @xmath167 and @xmath168 lie at @xmath169 and @xmath170 mev , the @xmath171 and @xmath172 at @xmath173 mev and @xmath174 mev , respectively@xcite ) , it is clear that , at these scales , we are not yet in the region of the validity of local duality .",
    "this makes the use of the single- and double - pinch families crucial to the reliability of the fesr analysis . in order to maintain as good convergence as possible on the ope side of the two sum rule families , while at the same time allowing enough variation in @xmath139 to get a good determination of the parameters of the spectral anstz , we also restrict our attention to scales , @xmath139 , greater than @xmath175 gev@xmath40 .",
    "since the general framework to be employed in the analysis has been outlined in the previous section , it remains only to discuss the input required on the hadronic and ope sides of the various sum rules .",
    "we begin with the hadronic side .",
    "we take , as our anstz for the hadronic spectral function , a sum of resonance contributions . for the scales used in the analysis ,",
    "the resonances present in the region of the hadronic spectral integral are the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath94 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "( although the tails of the @xmath171 and @xmath172 intrude slightly into the hadronic integration region for @xmath139 near @xmath176 gev@xmath40 , their contributions are strongly suppressed by the zeros in the weight functions .",
    "we have checked that including an effective , combined @xmath171-@xmath172 contribution in the spectral anstz has negligible effect on the extracted @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath94 spectral strength parameters . )",
    "we thus include contributions , written in terms of breit - wigner resonance forms , for all these resonances . because the separation of the @xmath167 and @xmath168 is much smaller than either of their widths , and also to reduce the number of free parameters in the spectral anstz , we have combined the latter two contributions .",
    "the strong overlap of the two resonances would , in any case , prevent one from being able to sensibly extract separate @xmath167 and @xmath168 strength parameters by means of any sum rule analysis of @xmath59 .",
    "the spectral anstz then has the form @xmath177\\ , \\label{specansatz}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 ( with @xmath179 the width of the resonance in question ) .",
    "this expression reduces to @xmath180 in the narrow width approximation ( nwa ) . the minus sign in front of @xmath181 and the factor of @xmath182",
    "are conventional ; inclusion of the former ensures that @xmath181 and @xmath183 become equal in the limit that the spectral contributions in the @xmath29-@xmath30 region are generated entirely by leading order @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing . for the combined @xmath167-@xmath168 contribution we have taken average values for the effective mass and width .",
    "@xmath183 , @xmath181 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 are free parameters , to be determined from the matching of hadronic and ope sides of the single- and double - pinch sum rules , for a range of @xmath139 , @xmath116 values .",
    "a few comments are in order concerning the form of the anstz above , and the physical meaning of the parameters to be extracted from the analysis which follows .",
    "the first concerns the need for the inclusion of a @xmath94 contribution .",
    "note that the correlator @xmath59 is very closely related to that , @xmath186 , obtained by dropping the strange part of the hypercharge current from @xmath59 ( the ope s for the two correlators are , in fact , identical to three - loop order ) .",
    "the latter correlator has been studied in a number of earlier svz - style analyses@xcite . in the earliest of these ,",
    "the nwa was employed for all resonances , and no @xmath94 contribution was included in the spectral anstz@xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the existence of significant cancellations between the nwa @xmath29 and @xmath30 contributions ( which would be exact in the limit of mixing dominance and equality of @xmath29 and @xmath30 masses ) means that a @xmath94 contribution , even if significantly smaller than the _ individual _ @xmath29 and @xmath30 contributions , could nonetheless be important . performing the sum rule analysis with a @xmath94 contribution",
    "included shows that this is , indeed the case@xcite .",
    "including the @xmath94 contribution in the spectral anstz also cured an unphysical feature of the solutions obtained earlier , which did not include it@xcite . the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , still employed the nwa for all resonances .",
    "the second point concerns the need to incorporate the @xmath29 width into the analysis . because , again , of the high degree of cancellation between the nwa @xmath29 and @xmath30 contributions , it was pointed out that the precise degree of this cancellation might well be sensitive to whether or not the difference between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 widths was retained in the spectral anstz@xcite .",
    "the subsequent analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that this is , indeed , the case : the spectral parameters , @xmath187 , decrease by factors @xmath188 when one employs the physical widths in place of the nwa .",
    "the third point concerns the interpretation of the higher resonance strength parameters , @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "it is , of course , very natural to take the spectral function to be resonance dominated .",
    "moreover , the near - threshold region of the spectral function has been computed to two loops in chpt@xcite , and one can see from this result that the corresponding low-@xmath138 background contribution to the relevant spectral integrals is tiny compared to that from the @xmath29-@xmath30 region .",
    "the case of the @xmath94 , however , is less clear , since background contributions above the @xmath29-@xmath30 region are not amenable to as reliable estimates , and hence might not be similarly negligible . in the anstz as written , such physical contributions , if present , could only be mocked up ( approximately ) by additional effective contributions to the @xmath94 and @xmath167-@xmath168 strengths .",
    "thus , one must use some caution in interpreting , for example , the extracted @xmath184 in terms of the physical resonance parameters @xmath189 and @xmath190  some portion of @xmath184 could actually correspond to an averaged version of background contributions in the region between @xmath29-@xmath30 and @xmath167-@xmath168 .",
    "the quality of the agreement between the hadronic and ope sides of our sum rules is , however , _",
    "post facto _ evidence in favor of resonance dominance , and hence also in favor of the possibility of interpreting @xmath184 in terms of @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "let us turn , then , to the input on the ope side of the sum rules .",
    "we will discuss the contributions , in turn , by operator dimension .    since the correlator in question is isospin - breaking , the only dimension @xmath152 contribution to @xmath59 is electromagnetic ( we adhere , here , to common usage , according to which the leading mass - dependent perturbative terms are labelled @xmath191 ) .",
    "we retain only the leading order ( 2-loop ) graph in this case .",
    "the @xmath191 contributions are dominated by the strong interaction terms proportional to @xmath192 . to 3-loop order ,",
    "the results for these terms follow from the 3-loop expressions for the correlator involving a flavor - non - diagonal current and its conjugate@xcite , since the perturbative contributions involving two quark loops and a purely gluonic intermediate state ( present for flavor diagonal currents but not for flavor - non - diagonal currents ) do not enter until 4-loop order .",
    "the resulting expressions are given in the appendix .",
    "to evaluate them , we require the running masses , @xmath193 , and running strong coupling , @xmath194 .",
    "these can be obtained once the values are determined at any fixed scale , @xmath195 .",
    "since the 4-loop @xmath196@xcite and @xmath197@xcite functions for qcd are now known , we have employed these when running the masses and coupling ( explicitly , we solve the rg equations exactly , using the truncated 4-loop @xmath196 and @xmath197 functions as input ) .    as input for the running coupling ,",

    "finally , we have demonstrated that the fesr method , particularly when implemented using both the single- and double - pinch weight families , is very effective , allowing a determination of the @xmath25 spectral parameters , @xmath187 , with rather small errors .",
    "these errors ( between @xmath260 and @xmath261 for @xmath183 , @xmath181 and @xmath184 ) are a factor of @xmath41 smaller than those obtained in the earlier analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite based on results of an svz analysis of @xmath186@xcite . in order to obtain this level of reduction , the ability to self - consistently determine @xmath243 was crucial .",
    "let us now turn to the phenomenological consequences of our results .",
    "first note that the corrections required to convert the measured contribution of the vector meson , @xmath262 , to the em spectral function , @xmath32 , into the corresponding contribution to either @xmath22 ( for @xmath263 ) or @xmath23 ( for @xmath264 ) are given by the ratios @xmath265 ^ 2&= & 0.982\\pm 0.0021 \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ \\frac{f^{8}_\\omega}{\\sqrt{3}\\ , f^{em}_\\omega}\\right]^2&= &   1.154\\pm 0.017 \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ \\frac{f^{8}_\\phi}{\\sqrt{3}\\ , f^{em}_\\phi}\\right]^2&= &   1.009\\pm 0.001\\ , \\label{corrections}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the numerical values follow from those in eq .",
    "( [ decayconst ] ) .",
    "the size of the deviations of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 corrections from @xmath107 are reduced by @xmath266 from those obtained in the earlier analysis @xcite ; that for the @xmath94 is increased , but remains small . in all cases",
    "the errors have been reduced by a factor of @xmath41 or more .",
    "note that the first of these corrections is the one relevant to precision tests of cvc .",
    "note also that , as claimed above , the corrections given in eqs .",
    "( [ corrections ] ) , for both the @xmath29 and @xmath30 , lie in the corresponding ranges produced by the estimate of section ii .    with the results given in eq .",
    "( [ corrections ] ) , it is now possible to correct the em data used as input to the inverse moment chiral sum rule for the @xmath2 order lec , @xmath3 .",
    "the sum rule is given by@xcite @xmath267\\ , \\label{invchmom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath268 is the renormalization scale of the effective chiral theory and @xmath269 are the usual renormalized @xmath270 order lec s of gasser and leutwyler@xcite .",
    "this sum rule was evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite using as input em data for the isoscalar spectral function and both em and @xmath13 decay data for the isovector spectral function .",
    "the corrections above , required for the em data , were not considered in this analysis .",
    "it is not clear , from our reading of the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite , exactly what the relative weightings of @xmath13 decay and em data in the determination of the @xmath271 contribution to the lhs above actually were .",
    "since , however , @xmath13 decay data is considerably more precise than electroproduction data , we have assumed in what follows that the determination is dominated by @xmath13 decay data .",
    "to the extent that this is true , we need only make corrections to the ( nominally ) isoscalar @xmath30 and @xmath94 contributions .",
    "the result of this exercise is a shift of @xmath272 from @xmath273 to @xmath274 ( for reference , making , instead , the somewhat perverse assumption that the determination of the @xmath271 contribution was dominated by em data , one would find @xmath275 .",
    "the full correction is dominated by that to the @xmath30 contribution .",
    "the reason this correction is so much larger than the others has been discussed above . )",
    "one should bear in mind , in interpreting these results , that ( 1 ) there are , in principle , additional corrections to be made to the nominal isovector and isoscalar contributions at higher @xmath138 , and ( 2 ) the @xmath276 contributions were taken to be purely isoscalar in the analysis of ref .  @xcite . because the separations within the higher isovector and isoscalar resonance pairs , @xmath167-@xmath168 and @xmath171-@xmath172 , are much smaller than the resonance widths , it is not possible to use sum rule methods to extract the individual isospin - breaking decay constants of these resonances .",
    "as such , we are unable to estimate the size of the former corrections . were the @xmath276 states to have a significant isovector component , the effect would be to raise @xmath272 .    an alternate method for determining @xmath3",
    "is based on the observation that @xmath3 occurs not only in the inverse chiral moment sum rule above , but also in the 2-loop chpt expression for @xmath277@xcite .",
    "it is , thus , possible to make an independent estimate by using the fitted spectral anstz for @xmath59 to compute @xmath277 , assuming negligible contribution from the portion of the spectrum above @xmath176 gev@xmath40 .",
    "one obtains , from this exercise , @xmath278 since there is no positivity constraint on @xmath279 one does not know in which direction this result would be changed by corrections due to the small higher-@xmath138 part of the spectral integral .",
    "the results of a study of the effect of including two combined spectral contributions , one for the @xmath280-@xmath281 and one for the @xmath171-@xmath172 , however , shows negligible change in @xmath272 , suggesting that such corrections are unlikely to be numerically significant . since the two independent determinations of @xmath3 are completely consistent , within errors , the conclusions that @xmath282 is considerably strengthened .",
    "the last phenomenological application of our results concerns the effect on narison s @xmath13-decay - like sum rule for @xmath209 . since a detailed discussion of the way in which one implements the isospin - breaking corrections is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we report here only the results of employing the improved determinations of the correction factors determined above . in doing",
    "so we will also take the opportunity to update the input parameters to the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , employing the newer ( 1998 ) aleph value of @xmath199@xcite .",
    "one finds , for example , using @xmath13 decay data for the isovector input , that the average over the values of @xmath283 extracted using the set of scales @xmath284 , @xmath285 and @xmath286 gev@xmath40 in the sum rule analysis is shifted from @xmath287 mev to @xmath288 mev ( @xmath289 mev if one retains the 1997 aleph value of @xmath290 as input ) .",
    "unfortunately , the errors on this value associated with uncertainties in the experimental input are still very large , @xmath291 mev at least , and this uncertainty can not be appreciably reduced without a significant improvement in the accuracy of the determination of the experimental @xmath292 and @xmath293 widths . as such , although the central value is brought into better agreement with that discussed above , little more can learned from the narison sum rule , at the present time .",
    "km would like to acknowledge the ongoing support of the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , and to thank terry goldman , andreas hcker , heath oconnell , derek leinweber , tony thomas , and tony williams for useful discussions .",
