    "these results attracted great attention to the field of anisotropic interactions in low - dimensional spin systems in experiment and in theory .",
    "the anisotropic interaction , referred to as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya - interaction ( dm interaction ) @xcite arises from the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) which constitutes a relativistic correction to the non - relativistic description of atoms .",

    "previously , we had to choose the components to accept @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "with alternation @xmath199 the values @xmath202 and @xmath203 are sufficient . as expected the alternation @xmath80 already lowers the dispersion for each flavor in the vicinity of @xmath213 .",

    "it was necessary to introduce an alternation @xmath80 in the nnn coupling @xmath87 of about @xmath223 .",
    "this alternation lowers the crystal symmetry and as a consequence the @xmath171 can be finite producing a small splitting between the two lowest modes .",
    "the qualitative discrepancies between experiment and theory for the two lowest modes around @xmath220r.l.u . and at high energies could not be resolved .",
    "the fit could be improved considerably compared to the fit in the previous section without nnn alternation .",
    "first , the dispersion of the third mode with its shallow w - shape is captured .",
    "second , the values of the relative dm couplings are significantly closer to reasonable expectations for the super exchange between copper ions . note in this context that recently , plumb _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also advocated much smaller values @xmath224 for bcpo when compared to theoretical calculations including many - triplon states .",
    "this supports our second fit presented in this section with its lower values for the dm interactions .",
    "for the sake of completeness we also discuss the dispersion perpendicular to the spin ladder , that means in spatial @xmath33-direction , see fig .",
    "[ pic_spinladder_dm ] . the width of its cosine shape is mainly affected by the interladder coupling @xmath35 .    . ]",
    "the shape of the @xmath33-mode dispersion agrees well with the measured dispersion , see fig .",
    "[ x_12_y_09_j2_perpendicular ] .",
    "the agreement for the two lower modes is poorer , but still acceptable .",
    "since a change of @xmath225 essentially influences all three modes in the same way , it is not possible to reduce the band width of the two lower modes without affecting the upper @xmath33-mode .",
    "we attempted to find better overall fits by varying @xmath225 .",

    "thus we still favor the parameter set used .",
    "[ x_12_y_09_j2_perpendicular ] shows that it yields a reasonable agreement",
    ".    moreover , we have to stress again that a description on the single - triplon level , i.e. , with a bilinear hamiltonian , can not capture all details of bcpo where a significant influence of higher triplon states is obvious , see the large error bars of the peaks at high energies in fig .  [ measured_data ] .",
    "in particular the two low - lying modes seem to hybridize with two - triplon continua as conjectured in ref .   from the down - bending of their dispersions around @xmath220r.l.u ..",
    "a model on the single - triplon level can address the effect of magnetic fields as well .",
    "so we turn to this issue as a final check for the validity of the minimal model advocated .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the three gap values of bcpo has been analyzed in the past on experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "a magnetic field is incorporated in the hamiltonian by the zeeman term @xmath226 with the @xmath19-factor , the bohr magneton @xmath227 and the magnetic field @xmath228 . for copper ions as in bcpo ,",
    "the expected value for @xmath19-factor is @xmath229 or slightly larger by up to 20% .",
    "analyses of the magnetic susceptibility indicate that the @xmath19-factor of bcpo takes the value @xmath230 due to the influence of the bismuth ions @xcite .",
    "+ we stress that the expected range of @xmath19-values @xcite for cu@xmath231 ions is @xmath232 which implies at maximum a 15@xmath217 effect of the soc .",
    "another aspect to be mentioned is the fact that bcpo may contains strong magnetoelastic couplings due to its structure , like the copper mineral azurite @xcite .",
    "thus , an easy interpretation of susceptibility measurements is difficult .    because of the importance of anisotropic interactions in bcpo the @xmath19-factor may be anisotropic as well",
    "this means that it may have different values depending on the direction of the magnetic field @xmath228 .",
    "this has be kept in mind in the following analysis .",
    "to proceed we have to identify the transformation of the zeeman term in terms of triplon operators . at first glance , one may think that the effective spin operator solves this issue as before .",
    "but in fact the problem is more complicated and simpler at the same time .",
    "first , it is more complicated because the zeeman term is even with respect to reflection about the center line .",
    "this implies that there is no linear contribution but one has to pass to the bilinear terms which we have not considered so far .",
    "second , however , it is simpler because the total spin @xmath233 is the generator of global rotations in spin space .",
    "since the cut is performed for the isotropic spin ladder conserving spin rotation invariance the total spin is not altered at all by the cut .",
    "thus we can compute its representation in terms of triplon operators prior to any cut and still use it for the effective model afterwards .    using the general representation of the spin operators by triplon operators @xcite @xmath234 and performing the fourier",
    "transform one obtains straightforwardly @xmath235 for a magnetic field in @xmath33-direction . for magnetic fields in @xmath37- or @xmath30-direction",
    "the spin components only need to be permuted cyclically .    a magnetic field parallel to the @xmath33-axis as in induces a coupling between the @xmath37-mode and the @xmath30-mode without changing the momentum . if the magnetic field points into @xmath30-direction , @xmath236 , a coupling between the @xmath37-mode and the @xmath33-mode ensues and if the magnetic field has only a @xmath37-component , @xmath237 there is a coupling between the @xmath30-mode and the @xmath33-mode without change of momentum .",
    "we emphasize that the zeeman is transformed to a bilinear triplon expression without any approximation .      to assess the effect of the magnetic field on the dispersions @xmath238 , @xmath76 we follow the steps explained in sect .",

    "the reason is that the magnetic field introduces no new couplings in addition to the considered anisotropic couplings .",
