    "supersymmetric gauge theory with matter representations plays a central role in many models of supersymmetry - breaking relevant to string phenomenology . in @xmath1 supergravity models based on perturbative string constructions ,",
    "the gauge dynamics in a `` hidden sector '' @xcite can induce a hierarchically small vacuum expectation value ( v.e.v . )  for the gaugino bilinear operator @xmath2 ( the `` gaugino condensate '' ) .",
    "if there are hidden matter multiplets @xcite , there may also be nonzero v.e.v.s for the squark bilinears @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gauge group representation index and @xmath5 are flavour indices . when coupled to supergravity",
    "the gaugino condensate is a source of supersymmetry - breaking @xcite which can in principle explain the ratio of the electroweak scale , and the notional masses of supersymmetric partners , to the mass scale of string theory .",
    "the scale of susy - breaking can be parameterized by the gravitino mass , @xmath6 , which is proportional to @xmath7 in the case of a single confining group . by using the different gauge groups and matter contents which appear in string constructions it is possible to reach phenomenologically reasonable values of @xmath6 , of order @xmath8 tev @xcite .",
    "it has has usually been assumed that the structure of the gauge theory vacuum is well described by _ globally _ supersymmetric qcd , since the strong - coupling scale is well below @xmath9 . in the limit of global supersymmetry",
    "@xmath10 the condensates do not break supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the condensate values may be found by instanton calculations @xcite or by constructing a supersymmetric effective action @xcite in terms of gauge invariant composite superfields @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the supersymmetric gauge field strength and @xmath14 are the quark and antiquark chiral superfields respectively .",
    "the supersymmetric zero - energy vacuum satisfies the conditions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the nonperturbative superpotential generated by the gauge dynamics . the gaugino condensate value is then determined ( up to a discrete symmetry ) in terms of the renormalisation group invariant scale @xmath18 and the squark mass matrix @xmath19 . in string - inspired supergravity models",
    "the scale @xmath18 and the squark masses are functions of the dilaton and moduli scalars of the underlying theory . hence the supersymmetry - breaking has a non - trivial dependence on the `` flat directions '' of string theory and it becomes possible to stabilize the moduli @xcite and ( under certain assumptions ! ) the dilaton @xcite , while inducing supersymmetry - breaking of the right magnitude @xcite .",
    "recently , sqcd has also been used in the construction of ( supersymmetric ) domain walls @xcite , motivated by cosmological issues or by the `` brane world '' scenario in which the observable matter fields are confined to a region localized in one or more directions within a higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the discrete set of degenerate vacua that is required is naturally realised in su@xmath20 sqcd , since the vacuum with nonzero gluino and matter condensates transforms under a non - anomalous @xmath21 symmetry that survives breaking by instantons : in general there will be a @xmath22 degeneracy . ] .",
    "when supersymmetry is broken by an explicit gluino mass term @xcite , the degeneracy is also broken , which raises doubts as to the stability of domain walls when gravitational corrections to the scalar potential are included . a non - zero v.e.v .",
    "for @xmath2 will in general break ( local ) susy and give the gluinos , including hidden sector gauginos , a mass .",
    "we will find , however , that the vacuum degeneracy is _ unbroken _ when the source of susy - breaking is the gaugino condensate itself .",
    "in this paper we attempt to find the corrections to the vacuum structure of sqcd due to its coupling to @xmath1 supergravity , including the dilaton and an overall modulus denoted by chiral superfields @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . the starting point will be the non - perturbative superpotential of @xcite and the resulting zero - energy vacuum of the globally supersymmetric theory .",
    "it has already been shown in the case of a sym hidden sector _ without _",
    "matter , that the resulting value of the gaugino condensate is identical to that at the minimum of the @xmath1 supergravity scalar potential @xmath25 , when terms in @xmath26 of mass dimension higher than @xmath27 ( _ i.e. _  suppressed by powers of @xmath9 ) are discarded @xcite .",
    "we will show that this also holds in the case of sqcd : on discarding the terms in the supergravity potential with mass dimension @xmath28 in the condensate fields ( note that we treat @xmath23 and @xmath24 as being dimensionless ) , we recover the global sqcd vacuum .",
    "the size of deviations from the `` truncated approximation '' for the condensates @xcite can be found by minimising the scalar potential in supergravity as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath29 , including higher - order terms .",
    "a similar approach was taken in the case of pure sym coupled to supergravity in @xcite .",
    "we follow the approach of burgess et al .",
    "@xcite in which the gaugino condensate is described by the _ classical _",
    "field @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and the chiral compensator superfield @xmath32 is introduced to simplify the formulation of supergravity coupled to matter @xcite using the superconformal tensor calculus are determined by gauge - fixing the superconformal symmetries so that the einstein term in the lagrangian is canonically normalised @xcite . ] .",
    "the gaugino bilinear @xmath33 corresponds to the lowest component of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 . similarly the squark condensate is the lowest component of a ( mass dimension 2 ) composite superfield @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 are @xmath39 flavours of left chiral superfields in the representation @xmath40 and its complex conjugate @xmath41 respectively .",
    "the v.e.v.s of the gaugino and squark bilinears are then given by the scalar components of @xmath26 and @xmath29 at the stationary point of the effective action @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the effective action results from the standard @xmath1 supergravity formula with the taylor - veneziano - yankielowicz ( tvy ) nonperturbative superpotential in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath43 , and an appropriate khler potential @xmath44 .",
    "the tvy superpotential , suitably amended for the case of a non - minimal gauge kinetic function and a modulus - dependent mass matrix , is @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the gauge kinetic function , equal to @xmath23 at tree level , which in general depends on the modulus @xmath24 through string loop threshold corrections @xcite , @xmath47 is the one - loop beta function coefficient such that @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ; @xmath50 is the second - order casimir invariant for the gauge group @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the index , equal to @xmath53 in the fundamental representation .",
    "@xmath54 is a constant which will be discussed shortly .",
    "it is convenient to diagonalise @xmath29 by performing unitary flavour rotations of the matter fields @xmath37 , @xmath38 so that @xmath55 . the superpotential can then be re - expressed as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a function which transforms under the target - space duality group sl@xmath59 @xcite such that the argument of the logarithm in ( [ eq : wnp_h ] ) is invariant .",
    "this is all we need to find the truncated approximation for the condensate values : it simply follows from setting the derivatives of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath43 to zero , giving us @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the beta - function coefficient for sym without matter .",
    "we see that the constant @xmath54 simply adjusts the scale of the condensates ; it has the same effect as a constant threshold correction to @xmath64 .",
    "when the condensate values ( [ eq : utr ] ) and ( [ eq : vtr ] ) are substituted back into the superpotential , the `` truncated superpotential '' @xmath65 emerges .",
    "this is the usual starting point for studying supersymmetry - breaking in string effective field theories ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we take the khler potential for the dilaton and moduli to be @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "the string tree - level khler potential for the dilaton @xmath68 has been replaced by a real function @xmath69 which parameterizes stringy nonperturbative dilaton dynamics @xcite .",
    "we take the green - schwarz coefficients @xmath70 to be zero to simplify the calculations .",
    "the correct form of @xmath69 is not known , however it is possible to constrain it by looking for a stable minimum in the potential for the dilaton and requiring @xmath71 to obtain the right sign kinetic term .",
    "the @xmath1 supergravity effective action is invariant under target - space sl@xmath59 transformations @xcite if the superpotential transforms as a modular form of weight @xmath72 .",
    "the modulus @xmath24 transforms as @xmath73 where @xmath74 are integers satisfying @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath26 must transform as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a unimodular phase which depends on @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "since the gauge fields are inert under target - space modular transformations this is achieved by @xmath32 having a non - trivial transformation property .",
    "the transformation of the squark condensate @xmath43 is determined by that of the @xmath80 , @xmath81 fields , which we take to have ( flavour - independent ) modular weights @xmath82 , @xmath83 : then @xmath84 .",
    "the function @xmath58 is determined by string threshold corrections ( up to multiplication by a modular invariant function of @xmath24 ) as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the dedekind eta - function and the coefficient @xmath87 is @xcite @xmath88 for a gauge group with twisted matter representations @xmath89 of modular weight @xmath82 .    the complete khler potential is then taken to be @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are constants and @xmath93 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this expression for the khler potential of @xmath26 has the correct dependence on @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; the @xmath43-dependent part is fixed by the requirements to respect u@xmath94 flavour symmetry and modular invariance .",
    "the khler potential for the composite fields @xmath26 and @xmath43 is only determined up to constant factors , and may receive higher - order corrections ( which , however , will be negligible when the field values are small ) .",
    "the constants @xmath91 , @xmath92 can not at present be computed , due to our incomplete knowledge of supersymmetric gauge dynamics , but they are expected to be of order unity . since the scalar potential in supergravity is a function of @xmath44 as well as the superpotential @xmath60 these constants will also appear in our results . in an earlier paper",
    "@xcite the constant @xmath91 was absorbed by rescaling the gaugino condensate , however since physical susy - breaking quantities are expressed in terms of the _ un - rescaled _ gaugino condensate ( and , in general , the normalisation of fields is fixed by the coefficients with which they enter into @xmath60 ) this will not be done here .",
    "the part of @xmath95 relevant to finding the value of the condensate is the scalar potential , which is given as usual by set to @xmath8 . ] @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 range over the scalar components of @xmath26 , @xmath99 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 for @xmath102 any function of the scalars and their complex conjugates , and @xmath103 is defined by @xmath104 .",
    "the details of the inverse khler metric components are relegated to the appendix .    as emphasized in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath95 is not an effective lagrangian in the sense of describing the light degrees of freedom only , ( it is a functional of the heavy fields @xmath26 and @xmath43 ) , rather it is the generating functional of `` two - particle irreducible '' correlation functions for the composite fields @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the kinetic terms in @xmath107 must be understood as the first terms in a derivative expansion ; there may be large higher - derivative corrections , so the effective action can not be reliably used to determine particle interaction vertices .",
    "however the scalar potential , _",
    "@xmath108 for constant field configurations , does not get these corrections .",
    "after some calculation , we find the scalar potential in closed form , which for convenience is expressed in terms of the rescaled quantities @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 : @xmath112 with @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath115 in this somewhat unwieldy expression , @xmath116 includes the terms of mass dimension 4 [ glossing over factors of @xmath117 , which survive in the global supersymmetry limit @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , while @xmath121 includes all terms of higher order in @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "since the argument is real _ in vacuo _ this does not cause an ambiguity .",
    "] at @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the `` truncated superpotential '' result for the scalar potential is then equivalent to substituting these condensate values back into the full potential , which is then proportional to @xmath121 , and discarding terms of dimension greater than 6 in powers of @xmath122 and @xmath129 .",
    "it is a non - trivial check on the result ( [ eq : v1 ] ) to carry out this substitution and verify that the scalar potential then coincides with previous results @xcite .",
    "in fact we obtain @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "note that the unknown constants @xmath91 and @xmath92 drop out of this expression .",
    "this occurs because the truncated approximation for the condensates is implemented via the superpotential @xmath17 alone , and does not ( at the given order of approximation in @xmath133 ) affect the khler potential for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the truncated approximation relies on the assumption that the condensate values at the minimum of @xmath116 is not much changed when the gravitationally - suppressed terms in @xmath121 are added .",
    "this is likely to be true when the condensate values @xmath122",
    ", @xmath123 are small , which is also the phenomenologically interesting regime for most applications .",
    "we are able to test this assumption explicitly by expanding about the truncated values to find the shift in the minimum . as a simplifying assumption the masses @xmath134 are set equal to @xmath135 and the squark condensates @xmath129 equal to @xmath123 .",
    "we define the fractional changes in the condensate values @xmath136 and take the real and imaginary parts re@xmath137 , im@xmath137 , re@xmath138 , im@xmath138 as independent variables .",
    "we then expand the scalar potential ( [ eq : v01 ] ) up to terms of mass dimension @xmath139 in the fields ( in fact , we would expect higher - order corrections to the khler potential for @xmath26 and @xmath99 to become significant beyond this order ) and up to quadratic order in @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the result takes the form @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the column - vector with entries re@xmath137 , im@xmath137 , re@xmath138 , im@xmath138 , and @xmath144 and @xmath145 are a vector and symmetric matrix of coefficients respectively .",

    "since we are evaluating @xmath146 and @xmath150 to leading order in @xmath151 we can discard dimension six terms in @xmath145 , provided that the matrix does not become singular .",

    "we can get an intuitive idea by plotting     ( @xmath159 , other parameters as specified in the text),width=396,height=302 ]    the dependence of the full potential ( [ eq : v01 ] ) on the absolute values of the condensates @xmath160 ( given that their phases are fixed to the truncated values ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the scalar potential @xmath161 for @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , with @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 set to the ( somewhat arbitrary ) values of @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 respectively .",

    "the structure of these terms is much richer than in the case without matter multiplets : however along the curve specified by @xmath173 , the form of the scalar potential and supergravity corrections     and @xmath174 along the curve @xmath173 for @xmath175 and a negative cosmological constant.,width=321,height=245 ]    reduces to the case of pure sym ( fig .",
    "3 ) ( see _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "there remains the question of the fate of the @xmath176 degenerate vacua in su@xmath20 sqcd when supersymmetry is broken . under the @xmath21 symmetry the condensates transform as @xmath177 , @xmath178 .",
    "it is known @xcite that the logarithmic term in the tvy effective action does not respect the symmetry , since the branch cut is crossed .",
    "there are in practice various ways of restoring the symmetry for the @xmath21 transformed vacua , including giving the squark condensates extra @xmath179 phases ( see ( * ? ? ? * first reference ) ) such that the argument of the logarithm is invariant , adding extra fields @xcite , or shifting the theta - angle by @xmath179 ( equivalent to taking @xmath180 ) which will exactly cancel the effect of an axial @xmath21 transformation .",
    "taking such `` fixes '' into account , the scalar potential ( [ eq : v01 ] ) is invariant under the @xmath21 symmetry by inspection , since @xmath181 and @xmath129 get the same phase .",
    "while this is a reassuring result for the construction of domain walls , we must ask why it appears to contradict the reasoning that any gaugino mass must break the vacuum degeneracy .",
    "we certainly expect that the ( _ hidden sector _ ) gauginos will get a small ( in general complex ) susy - breaking mass in the case we have studied .",
    "however , since the source of the mass is the gaugino condensate itself , _ the gaugino mass is not inert under the _ @xmath21 _",
    "symmetry_. in fact the mass term will be proportional to @xmath182 ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* first reference ) ) , which _ is _ invariant supergravity action in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath44 separately , rather than the khler function @xmath183 , since in going from one formulation to the other the gaugino fields are redefined by a complex phase and the phase of @xmath60 is eliminated @xcite . ] .",
    "given an explicit form for the khler potential of the composite superfields representing the condensates , the scalar potential in a string - inspired @xmath184 supergravity model can be calculated ; this allows us to find the minimum in the condensate directions without any assumptions about the presence or absence of supersymmetry - breaking .",
    "the deviation from the `` truncated '' globally supersymmetric vacuum of sqcd have been found in terms of the dilaton and string moduli .",
    "the phenomenological implications of deviations from the truncated approximation were discussed in an earlier paper @xcite . in the case with hidden matter",
    ", there is another possible cause for @xmath140 , @xmath141 to be large , namely if @xmath168 becomes large due to singular behaviour of the mass @xmath135 at some points in moduli space . since @xmath185 is proportional to @xmath156",
    ", the deviations may also be large if @xmath156 becomes small .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath186 the sqcd vacuum undergoes a phase transition and the charged matter fields themselves ( rather than the composite operator @xmath187 ) can get v.e.vs , so our effective action will not be valid .",
    "while the particular model from which this potential is derived , inspired by orbifolds of the heterotic string , is quite restrictive in its dependence on the dilaton and moduli , it would be relatively simple to extend the result to the case when the gauge kinetic function and mass matrix depend on several moduli , or the khler potential for the moduli is modified from its tree - level form ( _ e.g. _  by introducing functions @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the @xmath190th modulus ) .",
    "so our approach should be applicable to supergravity effective theories based on heterotic m - theory @xcite or type iib string models ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in particular we expect that the supergravity corrections will preserve the discrete symmetry of degenerate vacua in sym and sqcd .",

    "<S> we calculate the scalar potential of supersymmetric qcd ( in the regime @xmath0 ) coupled to @xmath1 supergravity with moduli - dependent gauge kinetic function and masses . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge dynamics are described by the taylor - veneziano - yankielowicz superpotential for composite effective fields . </S>",
    "<S> the potential can be expanded about the `` truncated '' point in the gaugino and matter condensate directions in order to find corrections to the globally supersymmetric minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the results are relevant to the phenomenology of supersymmetry - breaking in string - inspired supergravity models , and also to recent work on domain walls in sqcd . </S>"
