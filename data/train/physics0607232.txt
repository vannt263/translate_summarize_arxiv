    "there have been a number of studies of the convergence of the configuration interaction ( ci ) expansion of the helium ground state @xcite following the pioneering work of schwartz @xcite .",
    "these studies have investigated the convergence of the energy with respect to the number of partial waves included in the wave function and also with respect to the dimension of the radial basis .",
    "it has been known since 1962 @xcite that the energy converges slowly with respect to @xmath9 , the maximum angular momentum of any orbital included in the ci expansion .",
    "in particular the leading term to the energy increment is known to behave as @xmath10 at high @xmath9 .",
    "later work @xcite showed that the energy increments can be written more generally as @xmath11 where explicit expressions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 exist , namely @xmath14 no expressions for @xmath15 exist .",
    "the numerical values in eqs .",
    "( [ ae ] ) and ( [ be ] ) are obtained from close to exact wave functions @xcite .",
    "however , the convergence with respect to @xmath9 represents only one aspect of the convergence problem . just as important is the convergence with respect to the dimension of the radial basis @xmath2 , for a given @xmath9 .",
    "how do the increments to @xmath16 with increasing @xmath2 @xmath17 behave ?",
    "in effect , what are the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ? this aspect of the ci expansion is not as well understood as the convergence with @xmath9 and there have been no studies equivalent in sophistication to those of schwartz @xcite , hill @xcite and kutzelnigg and collaborators @xcite .",
    "some attention has been given to the radial convergence of the hydrogen atom in gaussian basis sets @xcite .",
    "the seminal investigation of carroll and collaborators concluded that @xmath20 for a natural orbital ( no ) basis @xcite .",
    "this result has been quite influential , and can be regarded as ultimately motivating the use of principal quantum number expansions to extrapolate energies to the infinite basis limit from correlation consistent basis sets @xcite .",
    "more recently , goldman performed a regression analysis to give @xmath21 for a no basis and @xmath22 for a slater basis with a common exponent @xcite .",

    "in this section the convergence properties of the lto basis which is energy optimized at each @xmath2 are studied . developing the sequence of exponents @xmath33 that gave the lowest energy for a lto basis of dimension @xmath34 was tedious . defining @xmath35 and @xmath36 as the differences in @xmath37 and @xmath38 arising from an imprecisely known @xmath33 , one has the relations @xmath39 the quadratic dependence of @xmath35 with respect to @xmath40 does make it easier to generate the sequence of @xmath41 values . but",
    "this quadratic dependence upon @xmath40 does make it harder to determine @xmath33 since the energy only depends weakly on @xmath42 in the vicinity of the minimum . since @xmath36 depends linearly on @xmath40 , any imprecision in @xmath33 impacts the precision of the @xmath43 sequence more severely .",
    "some specific data can be used to put this in perspective .",
    "the @xmath33 for @xmath44 have been determined to a precision for @xmath45 for the calculations reported in this section .",

    "determination of @xmath38 to a precision of @xmath49 @xmath6 would require fixing @xmath33 with an accuracy of @xmath50 which would necessitate an energy given to a accuracy of @xmath51 hartree .",

    "another notable feature of figure [ popthe ] were the oscillations in @xmath52 and @xmath53 for even and odd values of @xmath2 .",
    "oscillations in @xmath53 were previously seen for the no sequence but the @xmath53 oscillations in figure [ popthe ] are more pronounced than those in figure [ pnohe ] .",
    "some of the values in table [ nlimits ] were given using the 3-point averaging used previously for the natural orbital sequence .",
    "the asymptotic analysis to determine the variational limits were performed with the following series @xmath61 the results of the analysis are given in table [ nlimits ] .",

    "( [ dseries2 ] ) to include additional terms ( even if we knew what those terms were ! ) .",
    "results of a sequence of ci calculations of the he ground state with an @xmath0 basis have been presented .",
    "this can be regarded as the simplest model of a real atom that has a correlation cusp .",
    "the energy dependence of the lto basis was @xmath64 .",
    "this rather slow convergence rate can be improved by fitting a succession of @xmath41 values to the inverse power series @xmath65 and estimating the @xmath66 limit .",
    "it ultimately proved possible after adopting quadruple precision arithmetic , to reproduce the known energy in this model to an accuracy of @xmath67 hartree .",
    "the specific choice of the asymptotic series should be regarded as conjecture supported by numerical evidence .",
    "more definite proof would require the calculations to be extended to @xmath68 .",
    "the common exponent of the lto basis should not be chosen to optimize the energy for the largest calculation since this results in a distorted convergence pattern .",
    "in effect , optimizing the lto exponent for @xmath2 ltos , and then using the @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath2 energies to determine the coefficients of a 3-term expansion to eq .",
    "( [ eseries2 ] ) will give an inaccurate estimate of the energy correction needed to achieve the variational limit .",
    "any extrapolation would seem to require that @xmath2 ( the number of ltos ) should exceed @xmath34 ( the basis dimension at which @xmath42 was optimized ) by about ten or more .",
    "this conclusion holds for both the energy and electron - electron @xmath3-function .",
    "the very slow @xmath72 convergence of @xmath38 was also circumvented by the use of the @xmath66 corrections .",
    "the examinations of the convergence rate for an no basis set revealed a faster convergence .",
    "the no basis converged as @xmath73 with the next term being @xmath74 .",
    "the present determinations of the convergence rates are more rigorous than those of carroll _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "one surprising result was the slight even - odd oscillation in the convergence of the inter - electronic @xmath3-function .",
    "examination of the @xmath75 revealed noticeable even - odd oscillations in @xmath76 .",
    "the presence of these ripples could complicate determination of the variational limit of expectation values other than the energy .",
    "it was possible to extrapolate the energy of a 20 orbital no basis to the variational limit with an accuracy of about @xmath77 hartree .",
    "the convergence rate of the optimized lto basis was @xmath78 with the next term being @xmath79 .",
    "the degree of uncertainty in both of these exponents is much larger than for the fixed @xmath42 lto sequence or the no sequence .",
    "the extremely tedious nature of the @xmath42 optimization , combined with the lack of knowledge about the nature of the asymptotic series beyond the first two terms , make this extrapolation a less attractive proposition .",
    "the noticeable even - odd oscillation in @xmath53 and even @xmath52 further render the method even more unattractive .",
    "the implications of this behavior are not confined to the present work .",
    "for example , it is likely that correlated exponential basis sets composed of functions with @xmath80 could also exhibit complicated convergence patterns since @xmath42 is often energy optimized as the basis dimension is increased in size @xcite .",
    "consequently , it would not be surprising for estimates of the @xmath66 energy correction for variational calculations on systems using a hylleraas basis to be unreliable .",
    "for example , yan and coworkers have estimated the variational limit in a high precision calculation of psh using a hylleraas type basis @xcite .",
    "their estimated energy correction for the psh ground state energy ( only @xmath81 hartree ) was too small by at least a factor of three @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations for the present study was to gain insight into solving the problems associated with the very slow convergence of ci calculations for mixed electron - positron systems @xcite . in effect",
    ", the problem is to determine the complete basis set limit @xcite for these exotic systems .",
    "the slow @xmath82 convergence of the energy for an lto basis set is greatly improved by the adoption of extrapolation schemes .",
    "using the @xmath83 energy for the @xmath84 basis and the best extrapolation of the @xmath85 calculation in table [ nlimits ] as two reference points , one deduces an effective convergence rate of @xmath86 .",
    "the penalty associated with the use of the extrapolation formulae is the necessity to use quadruple precision arithmetic if 3 or more terms are retained in the inverse power series ( note , a 3-term series for @xmath87 was numerically stable in double precision arithmetic ) .",
    "the need to use the quadruple precision arithmetic is caused by the very small size of the @xmath88 increments and the impact of round - off error on the fit to the inverse power series .",
    "one somewhat ironic feature is that it is necessary to use a basis that is _ not _ energy optimized so that the extrapolation to the variational limit can be done reliably .",
    "the authors would like to thank shane caple and roy pidgeon of cdu for providing access to extra computing resources , and bill morris of sdsu for computational support .",
    "we would also like to thank david bosci of hewlett - packard ( darwin ) for giving us access to a demonstration itanium workstation .",
    "let us demonstrate that an asymptotic series @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) leads to @xmath91 when @xmath18 is defined from successive @xmath92 increments by @xmath93 substituting @xmath92 and @xmath94 from eq .",
    "( [ xnseries ] ) gives @xmath95 the logarithm in the numerator can be split into two terms @xmath96 the first term conveniently cancels with the denominator to give @xmath97 .",
    "the argument of the second term can be expanded @xmath98 using @xmath99 leads to @xmath100 the denominator is simplified using @xmath101 to finally give @xmath102 as required . if eq .",
    "( [ xnseries ] ) has successive terms where the power increments by @xmath103 or @xmath104 indefinitely , then this leads to a corresponding series , eq .",
    "( [ pnseries ] ) that also have powers that respectively increment by @xmath105 or @xmath106 indefinitely .",
    "this is not necessarily true for arbitrary @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ xnseries ] ) .",
    "the most time - consuming part of the calculation was the generation of the electron - electron and annihilation matrix elements .",
    "however , the expense of this was greatly reduced by generating an initial set of integrals for a given @xmath42 , and then using a scaling factor to generate the integral lists for other values of @xmath42 .",
    "the basic integral that has to be done is @xmath107 all integrals can be defined in terms of @xmath108 .",
    "consider the integral ( [ basicr ] ) and make the transformation @xmath109 . therefore @xmath110 and @xmath111 . similarly @xmath112 and @xmath113 and therefore @xmath114 from eq .",
    "( [ ltonorm ] ) , @xmath115 , so @xmath116 the scaling for the electron - electron repulsion integral is @xmath117 .",
