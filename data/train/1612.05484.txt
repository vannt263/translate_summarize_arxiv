    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions produced by the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) are capable of generating a hot , dense , strongly interacting medium . in order to study this medium , electromagnetic probes , such as @xmath0 pairs ,",
    "lend themselves as a natural choice .",
    "the @xmath0 are generated at all stages of the collision , interact electromagnetically , and thus , are able to traverse the strongly interacting medium with minimal effects on their final state while preserving information imprinted on them by their parent(s )",
    ". pairs with an invariant mass ( m@xmath3 ) less than @xmath4 gev / c@xmath5 are of particular interest because it contains production from the @xmath6 meson .",
    "the @xmath6 has been suggested to have its spectral function modified by the medium @xcite and is in agreement with measurements reported in @xcite .",
    "the in - medium modification of the @xmath6 spectral function is considered a possible link to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that the integrated yield of @xmath0 production within the low mass region ( lmr , m@xmath3 @xmath7 1.2 gev / c@xmath5 ) can be related to the lifetime of the fireball @xcite .",
    "the versatility of rhic enables a systematic study of the @xmath0 continuum .",
    "the beam energy scan program has enabled the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) to collect enough statistics to study @xmath0 production from au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 19.6 , 27 , 39 , and 62.4 gev while the total baryon density remained approximately constant , which the @xmath6 spectral function depends on . here , the @xmath0 continuum is studied as a function of @xmath1 and presented in the context of the fireball lifetime .",
    "additionally , rhic s versatility is evident from the different colliding species that it can accelerate . by switching from a au+au collision system at @xmath1 = 200 gev to a u+u collision system at @xmath1 = 193 gev ,",
    "the collision energy density is expected in most central collisions to be up to 20% higher than au+au collisions @xcite while the collision energy remains within a couple percent .",
    "if the energy density is increased , one may expect a longer fireball lifetime , and in turn , a larger @xmath0 yield in the lmr . here ,",
    "the @xmath0 continuum from u+u collisions is studied and compared to the continuum from au+au collisions .",
    "this paper presents a systematic study of the acceptance - corrected @xmath0 production measured by star as a function of @xmath1 = 27 , 39 , and 62.4 gev .",
    "furthermore , star measurements of the @xmath0 continuum produced by u+u collisions are presented .",
    "star has collected 70 m , 130 m , and 67 m events from the top-80% most central au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 27 , 39 , and 62.4 gev , respectively , and 270 m events from the top-80% most central u+u collisions at @xmath1 = 193 gev , where the top-80% represents star s minimum bias selection .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite and time of flight ( tof ) @xcite detectors are used to identify electrons and positrons within the star acceptance ( @xmath8 @xmath9 0.2 gev / c , @xmath10 @xmath11 1 , and @xmath12 @xmath11 1 ) . the tpc provides the particle identification and tracking via ionization energy loss ( de / dx ) while the tof is used to reject the slower hadrons then enhancing the tpc s particle identification and purity .",

    "selected electrons ( and positrons ) are combined to form the @xmath0 foreground .",
    "this contains background from the combinatorial background and correlated pairs ( e.g. jets and double dalitz decays ) . to estimate and remove the background , a geometric mean with a charge - acceptance correction is subtracted from the uncorrected @xmath0 distribution as a function of the pair invariant mass and pair transverse momentum ( @xmath14 ) . after subtraction ,",
