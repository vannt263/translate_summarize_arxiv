    "the instrument returned 109 observations of 75 astrophysical objects on the first mission and 223 observations of 108 astrophysical objects on the second .",
    "we have performed a new extraction and calibration of the befs spectra from both missions .",

    "the befs sits at the prime focus of the 1-m orfeus  telescope @xcite to improve the resolution and reduce astigmatism , the spectrometer employs mechanically - ruled diffraction gratings with varied line spacing in a non - rowland mounting .",
    "four such gratings , together with an optic that feeds a fine - guidance sensor , are arranged in an annulus at the end of the spectrometer opposite the entrance aperture as shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "each grating disperses a unique spectral region ( table [ gratings ] ) onto one of two microchannel - plate detectors located near the focal plane of the spectrometer .",
    "together , the four gratings simultaneously span the wavelength region from approximately 380 to 1220   at a spectral resolution of @xmath1 for point sources . a detailed discussion of the instrument s design may be found in @xcite .",
    "its performance on the _ orfeus - spas  i _ mission is described in @xcite and on the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ mission in @xcite .",
    "spectra a and b are imaged by detector 0 , spectra c and d by detector 1 ( fig .",
    "[ image ] ) . between the 1993 and 1996 flights ,",
    "the four gratings were shifted in their mountings to optimize their wavelength coverage . on the second flight , both spectra a and b span the important edge at 504  , and spectrum d extends to wavelengths just longer than the lyman @xmath2 line at 1216  . on the 1993 flight",
    ", both detectors were powered for nearly all observations , but on the 1996 flight , detector 0 was powered only during observations of known euv sources in order to minimize its contribution ( mostly in the form of detector background events ) to the telemetry stream . for both missions , grating a and b spectra were extracted only for selected targets .    an unplanned change in the spectrograph for the 1996 flight was an apparent shift of one or both of gratings a and b ; their spectra intersect , forming an `` x '' on the detector ( fig .  [ image ] ) .",
    "the most likely reason for the grating shift is `` creep '' in the viton material that was employed to constrain the optics within their holders .",
    "because these two optics were not de - mounted between flights , the viton , which is normally under a small shear load , may have crept or relaxed , leaving the grating susceptible to shifts under the stress of launch .",
    "gratings c and d show no such shift , perhaps because they were de - mounted after the first mission for overcoating with sic .    on the 1993 flight ,",
    "a single aperture 20  in diameter was used for all astronomical observations . on the 1996 flight ,",
    "the spectrograph was equipped with a diaphragm selection blade with three scientifically - useful positions : position 1 contains a single on - axis aperture 20  in diameter ; it was rarely used for science observations .",
    "position 2 contains a single on - axis aperture 10  in diameter , used during the initial star tracker / telescope co - alignment and for some observations of diffuse backgrounds and extended objects .",
    "position 3 , with which most science observations were obtained , contains three apertures .",
    "targets were usually placed in the on - axis aperture , which is 26  in diameter .",
    "a second clear aperture , about 1.4 times larger in area and displaced by 24 , was designed to obtain simultaneous airglow observations , although in crowded fields an astrophysical source was occasionally observed .",
    "a third aperture , 120  in diameter , was displaced by 50 and covered by a tin filter approximately 1500   thick .",
    "the tin filter is virtually opaque to fuv radiation and was employed primarily for observations of the euv spectrum of the bright b - type star @xmath3  cma .    in our nomenclature , on - axis ( target )",
    "spectra are designated as type 1 , off - axis ( airglow ) spectra as type 2 , and spectra obtained through the tin filter as type 3 . while the _ orfeus - spas  i _ data set consists only of spectra a1 , b1 , c1 , and d1 ,",
    "up to twelve separate spectra may be extracted from the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ data , three from each grating . in practice , however , we extract the airglow spectrum only from grating d and the tin - filter spectrum only from grating b , reducing the actual number of spectra to six : a1 , b1 , b3 , c1 , d1 , and d2 .",
    "airglow spectra from gratings a , b , and c are less useful than those from grating d : the grating a bandpass contains no geocoronal features , and spectrum b2 is contaminated by flux from spectrum a1 . for most targets",
    ", spectrum c1 contains no astrophysical flux , so extracting an airglow spectrum is redundant .",
    "complete photon lists for each detector , along with tools for extracting spectra from them , are available from the archive ( see section [ format ] ) .",
    "each photon event processed by our electronics requires 24 bits of encoding : 15 bits for the x ( dispersion direction ) coordinate , 8 bits for y , and 1 bit for detector identification .",
    "the image size is thus 32,768 @xmath4 256 pixels . in the fuv ( 9001200  ) ,",
    "a single pixel in x corresponds to a wavelength interval of approximately 0.014  .",
    "the instrumental resolution is @xmath5 0.23  , so the spectra are highly oversampled in wavelength . in the spatial domain",
    ", one x pixel corresponds to about 03 of sky , one y pixel to about 10 .",
    "for the _ orfeus - spas  i _ data set , we find that , at a given detector x coordinate , the fwhm of our spectra averages 5 pixels in the y dimension .",
    "we thus sum the counts over 11 y pixels ( best - fit center @xmath6 pixels ) , a range that encompasses more than 98% of the dispersed photon events .",
    "the general background is scaled from two strips , each spanning 3 pixels in y , immediately above and below the spectral region of the detector . for the second mission",
    ", improvements in the detector electronics tightened the point - spread function in both dimensions .",
    "accordingly , we use a 9-pixel window , with three pixels of background on either side , in our extraction of spectra obtained on _ orfeus - spas  ii_.    extraction windows were defined once for each spectrum and each flight .",
    "the spectra are not observed to drift out of the standard extraction windows during the _ orfeus - spas  i _ mission , but move slightly during the first few days of the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ flight .",
    "we correct for these motions by shifting the standard extraction window by up to three pixels in y. the motions are largest in the euv spectra . grating d spectra",
    "do not show significant motion except for one observing period ( gmt day 330 ) during the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ mission . on this flight , the spacecraft was twice required to assume a `` minimum drag '' configuration , in which the platform orientation was held fixed relative to the ram vector . after the second minimum - drag episode , which lasted for 12 hours , thermal stresses in the spacecraft resulted in a significant shift in the position of the spectrum on the detector , requiring a re - definition of the extraction window for observations in this time frame .",
    "the data quality does not seem to have been compromised .",
    "the minimum - drag event and its consequences are discussed in @xcite .    for each observation , a photon - event list is extracted from the spacecraft data stream . a preliminary extraction of the fuv spectrum ( if available and sufficiently bright ) is used to produce a plot of count rate versus integration time .",
    "these plots are manually inspected , and `` good times '' ( target in aperture , background rate low , telemetry uninterrupted , etc . )",
    "are identified .",
    "status information from the spacecraft star tracker is used to establish good times when spectrograph data can not .",
    "only data from these good times are included in the photon - event lists and extracted spectra that are supplied to the data archives .",
    "users interested in time - series analyses should determine whether time segments have been excluded from the observation of interest .",
    "when the spectral photon - event rate approaches the capacity of the telemetry system ( about 4400 events s@xmath0 ) , instrument dead - time effects become important .",
    "the detector electronics create `` stimulation '' events ( or stim pins ) at the detector edges at a rate ( @xmath7 s@xmath0 ) that can be measured during slews and other quiet periods . the observed rate of these events during on - target pointings enables us to estimate the dead time for genuine spectral photons .",
    "data buffering and the non - periodic nature of the telemetry - sampling system ensure that the throughput for both stimulation and actual photon events is identical .",
    "when the current flow parallel to the microchannel plate surface can not replenish the electrons being drained from the channel walls , the modal gain may sag .",
    "gain sag is a function of local count rate caused by unusually bright emission - line or continuum targets and must therefore be distinguished from overall dead - time effects , which are a function of total count rate , including background .",
    "gain sag is of greatest concern near the center of the band , where the astigmatism or spectral height is minimized . in the y - dimension ,",
    "gain sag causes a loss of spatial resolution , with the result that some source events are not contained within the nominal extraction window .",
    "( spectral spillover unrelated to gain sag may also occur if the source falls very near the edge of the entrance aperture . )",
    "the remedy is to study the extracted background spectra for evidence of spectral spillover and to adjust the background - subtraction procedure accordingly .",
    "the delay - line system that calculates the photon x coordinate is generally robust against gain sag , but high local count rates can lead to wavelength - dependent variations in throughput . a very bright continuum source may suffer an uncorrected loss of throughput over broad regions in which the astigmatism is small .",
    "we find a depression of the observed continuum whenever the local flux exceeds approximately @xmath8 erg @xmath9 s@xmath0 @xmath0 for wavelengths less than about 1110  . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "instrumental astigmatism broadens the spectrum in y , reducing the local count rate . in addition , spurious absorption features can be observed at approximately 1047 , 1052.5 , 1057 , and 1060  .",
    "we have determined that these features are fixed in detector coordinates , but may vary somewhat in their assigned wavelengths . for each spectrum that exceeds this brightness limit ,",
    "warnings have been placed in the corresponding file headers",
    ".      for fine pointing , the spacecraft s attitude control system ( acs ) utilizes signals from a star tracker aligned with the orfeus  telescope axis . under normal circumstances",
    ", the acs achieves an absolute pointing error of less than @xmath10 . for a few targets , plots of count rate versus time",
    "clearly indicate that the target was not centered in the aperture but fell near the edge ; the spectra obtained during these pointings are labeled ( in both the file headers and published catalogs ) as non - photometric .",
    "pointing jitter was about @xmath11  peak to peak on both flights of the orfeus  telescope .",
    "no attempt has been made to correct our spectra for the motion of the target in the aperture .",
    "because the telescope and star tracker were aligned using befs grating d spectra , any defocus in the telescope ( relative to the aperture plane of the spectrograph ) would cause light destined for the other gratings to be displaced systematically toward the aperture edge .",
    "we believe that some spectra obtained with gratings a and b on the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ mission suffer partial occultation , both because variations in the measured flux are greater than we can otherwise account for , and because sources observed with grating b through the much larger tin - filter aperture do not show flux variations .",
    "because the occultation effects can not be calculated _ a priori _ , befs euv spectra must be treated as non - photometric .",
    "the on - orbit background event rate , measured on an unilluminated region of the fuv detector during a night - time observation , is about 0.0016 counts per second per resolution element ( 9 pixels in y by 25 in x ) , due mostly to detector dark counts and cosmic rays .",
    "the rate measured in an extracted spectrum far from any airglow feature ranges from about 0.003 s@xmath0 at night to 0.04 s@xmath0 in some daytime pointings , probably due to stray lyman @xmath2 radiation .",
    "( the daytime rate of 0.0044 s@xmath0 quoted in @xcite is a typographical error . )",
    "the day and night count rates in the `` bright corner , '' a region of enhanced background flux present on both detectors on both missions ( see fig .  [ image ] ) , are approximately 0.09 and 0.01 s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "their ratio corresponds roughly to the day / night intensity ratio of diffuse lyman @xmath2 emission . in the 1993 data",
    "set , the bright corner contaminates grating a spectra at wavelengths shorter than about 420   and grating d spectra shorter than about 960  . in the 1996 data set , grating d spectra are contaminated at wavelengths below about 1000  , while the accidental shift of grating a moved its spectrum away from the bright corner .",
    "after the _ orfeus - spas  i _ mission , substantial baffling was added to the orfeus echelle spectrometer @xcite with which the telescope was shared .",
    "it was expected that this baffling would eliminate the bright corners on the berkeley detectors .",
    "the effect , however , is essentially unchanged in the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ data set and has since been attributed to a zero - order reflection from the berkeley gratings of a light leak at a hardware interface seam .",
    "the irregular footprint of the bright corner creates a crossover region in our fuv spectra ( grating d ) within which the background can not simply be scaled from the 3-pixel strips above and below the spectrum . to estimate the background here , we assume that the shape of the background in the spectral region and in the adjacent strips differs only by a translation in the x coordinate , determined from detector images collected during slew periods .",
    "the process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bright_corner ] , which shows part of an airglow spectrum obtained on the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ mission . to model the background between 965 and and 1022 ",
    ", we shift the background spectra extracted from the regions above ( bg1 ) and below ( bg0 ) the target spectrum by 600 pixels in x ( @xmath5 8.6  ; bg1 is shifted to the left , bg0 to the right ) , then scale their sum to the width of the target extraction window . for the _ orfeus - spas  i _ dataset",
    ", we shift the background strips by @xmath12 pixels in x ( @xmath5 10.7  ) in the region between 920 and 977  .",
    "it is possible for this procedure to introduce artificial features within the overlap region .",
    "artifacts of this type are not expected to be as narrow as unresolved spectral features , nor are they likely to exceed 10% of the background in amplitude . as such , they are of potential concern only for very faint targets .",
    "the extraction of grating a spectra is complicated by two effects . on the 1993 flight ,",
    "wavelengths shorter than about 420   are contaminated by the bright corner .",
    "the background in the crossover region ( about 390420  ) is estimated as for the grating d spectra , and the same caveats apply .",
    "on the 1996 flight , the grating a spectra moved away from the bright corner , but were left crossing the grating b spectra , contaminating spectrum a1 between 400 and 460   and spectrum b1 between 550 and 590  .",
    "we have developed an algorithm to estimate the contamination of spectrum a1 by shifting and adding the background strips ( similar to the scheme used for the edge of the bright corner ) , but the resulting background array provides only a rough estimate of the contamination due to spectrum b1 .",
    "researchers interested in absorption features or other spectral details should consult the raw - counts spectra , which are not background subtracted , to confirm the reality of apparent spectral features in this band .",
    "the higher effective area of grating b ( section [ orf2 ] ) makes the contribution of the overlap to spectrum b much less significant , and we do not attempt to correct for it .",
    "the befs monochromatic point - spread function ( psf ) is determined by fitting gaussian line profiles to emission features in the spectrum of the bright symbiotic binary .",

    "assuming that the intrinsic line width and instrument resolution add in quadrature , @xcite derive independent psf values from the lines of eight emitting species and quote a mean instrumental resolution of @xmath13 km s@xmath0  for the befs spectrograph .",

    "the effective area falls throughout the five - day _ orfeus - spas  i _ mission .",
    "the behavior differs between the two missions , we believe , because the first flight was the maiden voyage of the _ astro - spas _ spacecraft and thus subject to a higher level of contamination .",
    "( a second , two - week flight of _ astro - spas _ , with another payload , took place between the two _ orfeus - spas _ missions . )",
    "the long - wavelength dip in the effective area apparent early in both missions reflects , we believe , variations in the `` pulse height '' or amplitude of the charge cloud reaching the detector caused by adsorption of molecules onto the microchannel plate ( mcp ) during integration .",
    "subsequent `` scrubbing '' of the mcp during observations on orbit desorbs the molecules , restoring the original mcp gain .",
    "we can not test this hypothesis directly , because pulse - height information is not included in the _ orfeus - spas _ flight telemetry stream .",
    "preflight measurements , however , indicate higher - than - average gain in the region of the detector that subsequently shows a dip in effective area .",
    "we therefore suspect a pulse - height effect .",
    "comparison of the _ orfeus - spas  i _ and _ ii _ effective - area curves reveals a dramatic increase in the spectrograph s fuv sensitivity from the first flight to the second . in preparation for the second flight , the two long - wavelength diffraction gratings were over - coated with silicon carbide , increasing their reflectivity at fuv wavelengths .",
    "the effective area of our grating b spectra is essentially unchanged from one flight to the next , but the grating a sensitivity is reduced by half . for both channels ,",
    "the effective area falls precipitously for the first few days of the mission .",
    "in fact , it is likely that the sensitivity of our detector was fairly stable , but that euv observations of hz  43 , our flux - calibration target , suffered the photometric problems described in section [ pointing ] . rather than attempting to correct individual spectra for this effect ( which may differ greatly from one target to another ) ,",
    "we have used a single flux - calibration file , obtained early in the mission , for each of the grating a and b spectra obtained on the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ mission .",
    "the absolute flux calibration of these spectra is therefore suspect .",
    "the tin filter , unavailable on the 1993 flight , was used in 1996 for observations of the bright b - type star @xmath3 cma and two flux - calibration sources , hz  43 and mct  0501 - 2858 .",
    "the @xmath3 cma spectra were published @xcite before the tin - filter effective - area curve ( plotted in fig .",
    "[ o2_flux ] ) became available .",
    "observations obtained through the tin filter appear not to suffer the flux losses seen in the other euv data sets , perhaps because the aperture containing this filter is much larger than the standard observing aperture .",
    "because our primary flux - calibration star for the _ orfeus - spas  i _ mission , g  191b2b , shows no flux in the wavelength range covered by spectrum c , we used a theoretical effective - area curve for the grating c spectra from that flight .",
    "the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ calibration target hz  43 has a lower  column and exhibits enough flux at short wavelengths ( 670720  ) that we were able to scale the theoretical effective - area curve to the observed intensity .    second - order effective - area curves for gratings c and d were derived theoretically , as described above , then scaled to reproduce the sub - lyman - limit flux at the long - wavelength end of spectrum c and the @xmath33 geocoronal line in spectrum d , respectively . because of the photometric problems apparent in our euv data , it is possible that an euv - emitting source could contribute second - order flux to a grating d spectrum that is not accounted for in the corresponding grating a and b spectra .",
    "users should thus take care when subtracting the second - order spectra provided with the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ data .      @xcite discuss the statistical distribution of fluctuations in the response of the befs detector to uniform illumination .",
    "we examine two types of flat - field effects in fig .",
    "[ flat_field ] , which presents four spectra of hz  43 obtained over the course of the _ orfeus - spas  ii _ mission .",
    "the spectra are plotted in pixel space ; the wavelength scale is approximate .",
    "note the four narrow , p cygni - like features at about 1036 , 1042 , 1047 , and 1053  .",
    "these features are nearly fixed on the detector , but vary somewhat in wavelength space .",
    "they are not seen in most befs spectra , which have lower signal - to - noise ratios . in much brighter targets , these are the locations of the spurious absorption features discussed in section [ gain_sag ] ; the two effects are likely to be related . at shorter wavelengths , fig .",
    "[ flat_field ] shows a broad trough in the spectral continuum between about 990 and 1000  .",
    "early in the mission ( bottom curve ) , the feature has sharp edges and a flat core ; later , the drop becomes more gentle and the feature considerably less prominent .",
    "we do not attempt to correct for flat - field effects in the befs spectra .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further discussion of the detector background and flat field , grating scatter within the plane of dispersion , and the use of spectra obtained through the off - axis aperture to estimate the contribution of diffuse airglow emission .",
