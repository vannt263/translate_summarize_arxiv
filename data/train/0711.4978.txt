    "<S> we propose a new implementation of medium effects in jet structures in which a modification of the splitting function is included at every step in the typical final state parton shower . </S>",
    "<S> although the main application of this new formalism will be at the lhc , it is interesting that , in the presence of a trigger bias to small number of splittings , non - trivial angular dependences could appear with shapes similar to those measured experimentally at rhic in high-@xmath0 particle correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a medium is known to modify the branching evolution of the quarks or gluons produced at high-@xmath0 by a hard process . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding situation in the vacuum is well known and allows a probabilistic interpretation in which every branching  dictated by a splitting function , @xmath1  reduces the initial virtuality of the produced parton until some given scale @xmath2(1gev ) is reached and the process is stopped . in this way , the dglap evolution of the fragmentation function can be written at lo as @xmath3 the first term on the right - hand side in this expression corresponds to the contribution with no splittings between @xmath4 and @xmath5 while the second one gives the evolution when some finite amount of radiation is present . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution is controlled by the sudakov form factor @xmath6 } , \\label{eq : sudakovs}\\ ] ] with the interpretation of the probability of no resolvable branching between the two scales @xmath5 and @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the definition of the sudakov form factors and its probabilistic interpretation depend on the cancellation of the different divergencies appearing in the corresponding feynman diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> although such cancellation has never been proved on general grounds for partons re - scattering in a medium , it has been found in @xcite that , under certain assumptions , all the medium effects can be included in a redefinition of the splitting function @xmath7 where we have labeled as `` vac '' the corresponding vacuum splitting function . </S>",
    "<S> the main assumption to arrive at ( [ eq : medsplit ] ) is the independence of the multiple gluon emission when re - scattering with the nuclei is present so that an exponentiation of the splittings is possible . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility was exploited in @xcite where the additional term in the splitting probability is just taken from the medium - induced gluon radiation by comparing the leading contribution in the vacuum case . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 implementing ( [ eq : medsplit ] ) and ( [ medsplit ] ) into ( [ eq : dglapsud ] ) the medium - modified fragmentation functions can be computed  see also @xcite for a related approach . </S>",
    "<S> only the initial conditions of the evolution need to be specified . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the kkp set of ff @xcite was used for the vacuum as well as for the medium at the initial scale @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 . in this model </S>",
    "<S> all the medium - effects are built during the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for this ansatz is the following : in hadronic collisions , particles produced at high enough transverse momentum hadronize outside the medium . </S>",
    "<S> so , this assumes that the non - perturbative hadronization is not modified by the medium , whose effect is only to modify the perturbative associated radiation . </S>",
    "<S> all present radiative energy loss formalisms rely on this assumption .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the fact that the medium - induced gluon radiation , @xmath11 , is infrared and collinear finite allows for a simplification of this formulation , valid when @xmath12 . under these conditions , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dglapsud ] ) and ( [ eq : sudakovs ] ) reduce to the well known quenching weights @xcite previously used in most jet quenching phenomenology . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ff ] we plot the fragmentation functions in the presence of a medium for different values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 by including the modification at every individual splitting , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dglapsud])([medsplit ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also plotted in the same figure is the comparison with the corresponding ff using the standard quenching weights @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , both procedures will provide similar descriptions of the experimental data on one - particle inclusive suppression @xcite but the new approach allows for a clean implementation of the effects for less inclusive measurements as jet structures or particle correlations .            </S>",
    "<S> the most general case of a complete parton shower implementation with nuclear effects has not been computed yet . </S>",
    "<S> there is a simplification , in a very specific situation , in which the radiated gluons have energy @xmath15 where the medium - induced gluon radiation can be approximated by @xcite @xmath16 keeping only the first term in the expansion of ( [ eq : dglapsud ] ) we obtain the probability of just one splitting , which , inserting ( [ eq : migrap ] ) and making the change to laboratory azimuthal angle for a jet produced at @xmath17 reads @xmath18    eq . ( [ eq : splitlab ] ) presents a non - trivial angular structure in which , due to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal suppression of radiation at small angles , a dip is observed in the direction of the original jet in contrast with the known situation in the vacuum , where collinear singularities make the jet shapes to be well collimated around @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> similar structures has been observed experimentally by two particle correlations at moderate values of the transverse momentum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the calculations presented here lack of a realistic implementation , including multiple splittings and hadronization , it is encouraging to see a perturbative mechanism producing such a non - trivial shape @xcite . in order to make a rough comparison with experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , we just smeared the distribution in @xmath20 and @xmath21 to mimic the experimental situation . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding distributions are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ndist ] . </S>"
