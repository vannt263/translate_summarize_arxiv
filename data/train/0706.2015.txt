    "in the recent paper  @xcite , alday and maldacena made a substantial progress in applying ideas of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite to study scattering amplitudes of gluons at strong coupling .",
    "one of the crucial ingredients of  @xcite is dimensional regularization on the gravity dual side .",
    "the importance of it is motivated by the fact that many field theory results on gluon amplitudes have been obtained in dimensional regularization scheme and it is necessary to use the same regularization if one intends to provide an unambiguous comparison between the gravity and field theory sides . in particular , alday in maldacena  @xcite computed the four - gluon amplitude at strong coupling and found a perfect agreement with the infrared structure in field theory .",
    "in addition , they also found an agreement with the conjecture of bern , dixon and smirnov  @xcite ( see also an earlier paper  @xcite ) regarding the all - loop iterative structure of gluon amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of  @xcite made a prediction for the strong coupling behavior of the cusp anomalous dimension .",
    "their result agreed with  @xcite , @xcite where the same behavior was established by different methods .",
    "it is well - known that in field theory , gluon amplitudes have to satisfy several consistency conditions such as unitarity cuts , infrared behavior , collinear and soft gluon limits .",
    "it is very interesting to understand what they are translated on the ads side to . the simplest limit that one can consider is the infrared divergences . in field theory",
    "they arise from a very special set of feynman diagrams .",
    "this makes them summable to all orders in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that on the ads side the infrared structure also arises from some very special minimal worldsheets whose study does not require the complete answer for the @xmath0-gluon amplitude . in this short note , we propose that the infrared behavior can be completely derived from the worldsheet whose boundary is momenta of two neighboring gluons meeting at a cusp . we show that this is consistent with the infrared structure on the field theory side .",
    "when applied to the case of four gluons , this proposal gives the same answer as the infrared divergent contribution to the four - gluon amplitude found in  @xcite .",
    "the infrared behavior of the gluon amplitudes in @xmath1 super yang - mills theory is known to all orders in perturbation theory and has a nice exponential structure  @xcite . in our review",
    "below , we will follow section iv of  @xcite",
    ". we will assume that we have performed the color decomposition and study the leading - color partial amplitudes .",
    "first , let us define @xmath2 in this equation , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the tree - level and @xmath5-loop n - gluon amplitudes respectively .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 indicates that @xmath7 is evaluated in dimensional regularization .",
    "furthermore , let us define @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10 is the thooft coupling and @xmath11 is the euler constant .",
    "for any neighboring pair of gluons @xmath12 with momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 we introduce @xmath15 the leading - color all - loop infrared behavior of @xmath16 can be expressed as follows @xmath17 here @xmath18 represents the infrared behavior at one loop and has the following additive structure @xmath19 where @xmath20 the function @xmath21 has a perturbative expansion in @xmath6 @xmath22 the leading term @xmath23 is known to coincide , up to a constant , with the cusp anomalous dimension @xmath24 , @xmath25 substituting @xmath18 into eq .",
    "we obtain that the right hand side has the following functional dependence @xmath26 for some function @xmath27 which goes to zero for finite negative @xmath6 as @xmath28 goes to zero . to find another implication of the general infrared behavior",
    "let us consider the terms of order @xmath29 .",
    "it follows from eqs .  ,",
    "and   that up to an additive constant @xmath30 contains the the terms of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the all - loop cusp anomalous dimension and @xmath33 note that the definition of @xmath34 depends on the infrared scale @xmath35 .",
    "as we change @xmath35 , @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 on the other hand , the coefficient in front of the @xmath38 term is always the cusp anomalous dimension .",
    "in  @xcite , alday and maldacena developed an approach to study the strong coupling limit of @xmath1 gluon amplitudes using string theory in ads space .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , scattering of open string states happens at large proper ads momenta .",
    "therefore , similarly to the flat space case  @xcite , the scattering amplitude to the leading order is determined by the appropriate classical solution @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the action evaluated on the classical solution , which is just the area of the worldsheet .",
    "the prefactor was determined in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , similarly to the flat space case  @xcite , @xmath41 depends only on the momenta of the scattered particles and not on any other additional data like the helicity structure .",
    "all information about the momenta is encoded in the boundary conditions . to describe it ,",
    "it is convenient to use the t - dual coordinates  @xcite ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "-gluon amplitude . for simplicity , we removed the factors of @xmath42 multiplying each @xmath43.,width=264 ]    in this coordinates , the metric is also ads @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the radius of ads space .",
    "the boundary conditions are imposed at @xmath46 . in the t - dual",
    "coordinates the fact that a state has momentum @xmath47 translates into the statement that it has a winding @xmath48 then , the boundary conditions are such that as @xmath49 the worldsheet describing the @xmath0-particle amplitude ends on the vectors @xmath50 .",
    "the ordering of the vectors corresponds to the particular color ordered amplitude . from momentum conservation",
    "it follows that the above vectors form a closed loop .",
    "since @xmath1 gluon amplitudes are infrared divergent they have to be regulated . in order to be able to compare the string and field theory results",
    ", one has to use the same regularization scheme .",
    "the most convenient is to use dimensional regularization .",
    "the regulated ads metric looks as follows  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 the parametrization of @xmath53 in terms of the ir scale @xmath35 is chosen to match the field theory side . in notation  ,",
    "the worldsheet action becomes        @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the lagrangian evaluated at @xmath56 , that is using the metric   where the ads radius is set to unity .",
    "let us now consider the boundary of the worldsheet corresponding to the @xmath0-gluon amplitude as in figure 1 .",
    "the boundary consists of @xmath0 vectors @xmath50 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath57 the cusp where the vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 meet . in this note , we propose that the infrared behavior of the @xmath0-gluon amplitude at strong coupling is fully captured by the local behavior of the worldsheet near the @xmath0 cusps . to be more precise , we propose that the infrared divergences have the structure as in figure 2 .",
    "that is ,   or @xmath60 since the difference between them , @xmath61 is independent of @xmath10 and , thus , is subleading at strong coupling . ]",
    "@xmath62 the summation is over all the pairs of neighboring gluons or , equivalently , over all cusps . the @xmath63-th term in the right hand sides in eq .",
    "and in figure 2 represents the area @xmath64 of the minimal worldsheet whose boundary is just the two vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 . as a trivial consistency check",
    ", we note that eq .",
    "has the same additive structure as eqs .",
    ", on the field theory side .    since eq .   and figure 2 have an additive structure",
    ", it is sufficient to single out only one cusp @xmath57 and consider the problem of finding a minimal worldsheet which ends on the vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we want to point out that our calculation is universal and does not depend on global structure of the amplitude . without loss of generality , we can assume that the worldsheet is located in the subspace parametrized by @xmath65 and set @xmath66 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the light - cone coordinates in the @xmath67 plane @xmath68 the metric in these coordinates becomes @xmath69 the action is given by eq .",
    "@xmath70 we will parametrize the worldsheet by @xmath71 . then it follows that @xmath72 we need to find a solution that turns into two intersecting lines whose directions are specified by @xmath13 and @xmath14 as @xmath49 .",
    "we can choose the coordinate system in such a way that one of the vectors , say @xmath13 , is located in the @xmath71 plane .",
    "moreover , we can chose @xmath13 to lie along the @xmath73 direction .",
    "we parametrize it as @xmath74 in the @xmath75 coordinates .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 is arbitrary as long as it is non - zero and finite .",
    "similarly , we parametrize the vector @xmath14 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the tangent of the angle between the lines when they are projected to the @xmath71 plane and @xmath79 , like @xmath76 , is an arbitrary non - zero finite parameter.from eqs .",
    "and   it follows that @xmath80 in order to find the solution of interest , we start with the solution ending on the lines @xmath81 this solution was found in  @xcite .",
    "it looks like @xmath82 the solution we are interested in has to approach   in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "a simple ansatz that satisfies the correct boundary conditions and approaches eq .   in the large @xmath78 limit",
    "is @xmath84 the ansatz for @xmath85 in eq .",
    "is chosen to make sure that the both lines are light - like .",
    "it turns out that eq .",
    "is the exact solutions of the equations of motion to all orders in @xmath6 . to continue , it is convenient to change the variables from @xmath71 to @xmath86 so that the @xmath86 components of @xmath87 and @xmath88 become @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the transformation is the following @xmath91 in these new variables we get @xmath92 furthermore , @xmath93 substituting eqs .  - into the action  , , we obtain @xmath94 assuming that @xmath95 and performing the integral , we find that @xmath96 where @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 eq",
    ".   represents our final answer for @xmath64 to all orders in @xmath6 .",
    "note that it depends only on the kinematic invariant @xmath28 and not separately on @xmath99 and @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , note that eq .",
    "is consistent with the general properties of the infrared behavior of @xmath1 gluon amplitudes reviewed in the previous section .",
    "it is of the form  , where the function @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 to compare eq .   with eq .",
    "on the field theory side we have to expand @xmath97 to the linear order in @xmath6 .",
    "up to a constant , this yields the following @xmath6-independent term in @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 since the general structure of the infrared divergences implies that the coefficient at @xmath38 is the cusp anomalous dimension , we find that it behaves as @xmath106 at strong coupling which is in agreement with  @xcite .    as the last consistency check ,",
    "let us compare   with the infrared divergent contribution to the strong coupling limit of the four - gluon amplitude which was obtain by alday and maldacena in  @xcite .",
    "in the case of the four - gluon amplitude we have only two independent kinematic invariants which are usually denoted by @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 as the result , eq .",
    "becomes @xmath110 where @xmath111 is given by @xmath112 and @xmath113 is given by the similar expression with @xmath107 replaced with @xmath108 .",
    "quite remarkably , eqs .   and",
    "exactly coincide with the infrared behavior of the four - gluon amplitude computed in  @xcite which represents a non - trivial check of our proposal .    to conclude",
    ", we have proposed that the infrared structure of the gluon amplitudes at strong coupling is fully captured by the behavior near the cusps as indicated in figure 2 .",
    "the total @xmath0-gluon amplitude is then given by @xmath114 where @xmath102 is given by eq .",
    "and @xmath115 is the @xmath35-independent finite contribution which is often reffered to as the finite remainder .",
    "it is independent of the helicity structure and , thus , is a function only of the kinematic invariants .",
    "the calculation of @xmath115 is , certainly , a very complicated problem and one can expect that understanding of unitarity cuts and collinear behaviour in ads can provide a significant help .",
    "the author is very grateful to freddy cachazo for helpful discussions .",
    "the author would also like to thank juan maldacena and arkady tseytlin for comments on the first version of the paper .",
    "the work at the perimeter institute is supported by in part by the government of canada through nserc and by the province of ontario through mri ."
