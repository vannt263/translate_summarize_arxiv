    "wasp-33 b is a hot jupiter orbiting a relatively massive ( @xmath6 ) , rapidly rotating ( @xmath7 km s@xmath1 ) star @xcite , which is notable for being one of the hottest planet host stars known ( @xmath8 k ) . due to the wide , rotationally broadened stellar lines , @xcite were only able to set an upper limit on the radial velocity reflex motion of the host star due to the planet . even in the _ kepler _ era , detection of this motion",
    "is typically necessary to confirm a transiting giant planet candidate as a",
    "_ bona fide _ planet .",
    "instead , they confirmed the planetary nature of the transiting companion using doppler tomography .",
    "this method relies upon the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite , where the transit of a companion across a rotating star causes a perturbation to the rotationally broadened stellar line profile .",
    "doppler tomographic observations allow us to resolve this line profile perturbation spectroscopically , unlike typical radial velocity rossiter - mclaughlin observations , where the perturbation is interpreted as an anomalous radial velocity shift due to the changing photocenter of the line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most importantly for this work , the movement of the line profile perturbation across the line profile during the transit maps directly to the path of the planet across the stellar disk , allowing us to measure the location and orientation of the transit chord relative to the projected stellar rotation axis .",
    "using their doppler tomographic observations of wasp-33 b , @xcite measured a sky - projected spin - orbit misalignment of @xmath9 ( using their dataset from mcdonald observatory ) .",
    "they also found an orbital period of @xmath10 days . since wasp-33 b is on a highly inclined , short - period orbit about a rapidly rotating ( and therefore likely dynamically oblate ) star",
    ", @xcite estimated that the orbital nodes should precess at a rate of @xmath11 s@xmath1 ( @xmath12 yr@xmath1 ) .",
    "they predicted that this would result in a changing transit duration that would be detectable in @xmath13 years .",
    "such a measurement will be challenging , however , as wasp-33 is a @xmath14 sct variable @xcite . the stellar non - radial pulsations cause distortions in the transit light curve , which could induce systematic errors in the measurement of the transit duration .",
    "this change in the transit duration , however , is caused by the changing impact parameter ( denoted @xmath15 ) , which can be more accurately measured using doppler tomography than using the transit lightcurve . for instance , @xcite measured the impact parameter of wasp-33  b to be @xmath16 using their spectroscopic data and @xmath17 using their photometric data .",
    "it has now been more than six years since the doppler tomographic observations presented by @xcite were obtained .",
    "this offers a sufficient time baseline to allow the detection of the movement of the transit chord due to nodal precession .",
    "we have thus collected a second epoch of doppler tomographic observations , and have detected the changing transit chord .",
    "orbital precession has previously been detected for kepler-13 ab by @xcite , who measured a rate of change of the impact parameter of @xmath18 yr@xmath1 using the changing transit duration in _ kepler _ photometry . like",
    "wasp-33 b , kepler-13 ab is a hot jupiter orbiting a rapidly rotating star on an inclined orbit @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a large rate of nodal precession for the young hot jupiter candidate ptfo 8 - 8695 b @xcite , but this planet candidate is still unconfirmed @xcite .",
    "our measurement of the orbital precession of wasp-33 b is thus the second such measurement for a confirmed exoplanet orbiting a single star .",
    "@xcite observed one transit of wasp-33 b with the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope ( hjst ) at mcdonald observatory on 2008 november 12 ut , and we reanalyzed these data .",
    "they also observed two other transits with other facilities , but we did not reanylize these data .",
    "we observed a second transit with the hjst on 2014 october 4 ut , 2,152 days ( 1,764 planetary orbits ) after the first dataset .",
    "we obtained both datasets using the robert g. tull coud spectrograph ( ts23 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a spectral resolving power of @xmath19 .",
    "the exposure length was 900 seconds for both datasets .",
    "we obtained 13 spectra in 2008 and 21 in 2014 ; 10 spectra in each dataset were taken during the transit .",
    "our methodology for preparing the time series spectra for doppler tomographic analysis was substantially the same as that described in @xcite .",
    "we extracted an average line profile from each spectrum using least squares deconvolution @xcite , and subtracted the average out - of - transit line profile to produce time series line profile residuals , which are most useful for analysis .",
    "thanks to wasp-33 s brightness ( @xmath20 ) we were able to obtain very high quality line profiles ; the standard deviation of the continuum was 0.010 of the depth of the line profile for the 2008 observations and 0.0078 for the 2014 dataset .",
    "we modeled the line profile perturbation due to the transiting planet by numerically integrating the line profile from each surface element on the star over the visible stellar disk , accounting for the finite exposure time .",
    "the stellar non - radial pulsations caused a pattern of striations in the time series line profile residuals , complicating the analysis . in order to minimize this effect we exploited the fact that the pulsations propagate in the prograde direction , whereas the planetary orbit is retrograde ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the frequency components due to the pulsations and the planetary transit thus tended to be separated in the two - dimensional fourier transform of the time series line profile residuals .",
    "we constructed a fourier filter by multiplying each complex element of the fourier transform by unity if that element was in a region where there was power only from the transit signature , and zero if the element was in a region with significant power from the pulsations , with a hann function transition between the two regimes .",
    "we then performed an inverse fourier transform on the filtered fourier spectrum .",
    "this successfully removed most of the effects of the pulsations . for best results we had to filter out low - frequency modes where there was power from both the pulsations and the transit ; however , the high - frequency components were sufficient to reconstruct most of the transit signature .",
    "we obtained best - fit values of the transit parameters by exploring the likelihood space of model fits to the data using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) with affine - invariant ensemble samplers @xcite , as implemented in emcee @xcite .",
    "we performed a joint fit to the time series line profile residuals from both 2008 and 2014 , as well as a single spectral line , the latter in order to measure the @xmath22 of wasp-33 .",
    "for the single line we fit a rotationally broadened line profile to the ba ii line at 6141.7   , chosen because it is deep but unblended and unsaturated . in order to minimize the impact of the line profile variations we stacked all of our 2008 spectra .",
    "we did not utilize the 2014 dataset because we could not obtain a good fit to the ba ii line . for the time series line profile residuals we fit a transit model computed as described above and passed through our fourier filter .",
    "the mcmc had sixteen parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath15 , and the transit epoch @xmath24 at the two epochs , @xmath22 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , four quadratic limb darkening parameters ( two each for the single - line and the time series line profile residual data ) , the width of the gaussian line profile from an individual surface element ( due to intrinsic broadening , thermal broadening , and microturbulence ) , and a velocity offset between the single line data and the rest frame . all parameters except @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath15 were assumed to remain constant between 2008 and 2014 .",
    "we calculated @xmath24 for 2008 from the epoch and period given by @xcite , while the 2014 transit epoch was taken from our simultaneous photometric observations of that transit ( see  [ phot ] ) .",
    "rather than fitting the limb darkening coefficients directly , we used the triangular sampling method of @xcite .",
    "we set gaussian priors upon @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the 2008 @xmath24 , and set the prior value and width to the parameter value and uncertainty , respectively , found by @xcite , while the prior value and width for the 2014 @xmath24 were taken from our photometric observations .",
    "for the limb darkening parameters and prior values we used the same methodology as @xcite .",
    "we used a set of 100 walkers , ran each one for 1000 steps , and cut off the first 500 steps of convergence and burn - in , resulting in 50,000 samples from the posterior distribution .",
    "deviation of the observed transit midpoint from that expected based on the published ephemeris could masquerade as a change of the transit chord in the doppler tomographic data . with exposure lengths of 900 seconds , the spectroscopic data alone did not sufficiently constrain the transit epoch . in order to better constrain this parameter we simultaneously obtained photometry of wasp-33 using the las",
    "cumbres observatory global telescope network ( lcogt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) 1 m telescope and sbig camera at mcdonald observatory .",
    "we observed in the sloan _",
    "i _ band , and defocused the telescope in order to reduce the effects of inter - pixel variations and avoid saturating on this bright star ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we obtained 700 images , each with an exposure length of 10 seconds .",
    "we used the astrometry.net code @xcite to register all images , and then performed aperture photometry on wasp-33 and three reference stars using the idl task aper .",
    "we calculated the formal uncertainty on each data point incorporating the uncertainty from aper ( based upon photon - counting noise and uncertainty in the sky background ) , as well as an estimated contribution from the calibration frames and from scintillation noise @xcite .",
    "we produced a model of the transit lightcurve using the jktebop package ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we used an mcmc to produce posterior probability distributions for each of the model parameters ( we used a custom mcmc derived from that in * ? ? ?",
    "* not that built into jktebop ) .",
    "there were significant distortions of the lightcurve due to the aforementioned stellar variability .",
    "we treated the stellar variability as correlated noise , and modeled it non - parametrically using gaussian process regression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this methodology has been used previously to treat stellar noise in transit lightcurves ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we constructed the covariance matrix @xmath28 using a matern 3/2 kernel , where each element of the matrix was @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote two of the photometric observations , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the times at which observations @xmath30 were obtained , @xmath33 is the formal uncertainty on datapoint @xmath34 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are hyperparameters describing the amplitude and timescale of the stellar variability , respectively .",
    "the mcmc used eight parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath25 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the epoch of transit center @xmath38 , and two quadratic limb darkening parameters .",
    "we set gaussian priors upon @xmath39 and @xmath26 , using the best - fit values and uncertainties found by @xcite as the center and width of the priors , respectively .",
    "we also set priors upon the limb - darkening parameters , using jktld to find the expected limb darkening values from atlas model atmospheres from @xcite at the stellar parameters of wasp-33 found by @xcite .",
    "the lcogt lightcurve is shown in fig .",
    "[ lcfig ] .",
    "we found a best - fit time of transit center of @xmath40 bjd .",
    "this is 12.3 minutes later than predicted by the ephemeris of @xcite , but is in agreement with that predicted by the ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "we show the time series line profile residuals in fig .",
    "[ tslprfig ] .",
    "the best - fit values of the model parameters are given in table  [ restable ] .",
    "we found that both the impact parameter and the spin - orbit misalignment have changed between the two epochs : we measured @xmath41 and @xmath42  @xmath3 in 2008 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44  @xmath3 in 2014 .",
    "our uncertainties on these values are rather small ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* whose uncertainties on @xmath23 and @xmath15 are @xmath45 times the size of ours ) .",
    "they did not remove the stellar pulsations from their data , and so it is perhaps not unexpected that we can obtain a more precise result .",
    "there may , however , be sources of systematic errors which were not taken into account in our calculation of the uncertainties .",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath15 that we obtained from the 2008 data disagree with those found by @xcite by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , but agree with another of their doppler tomographic datasets to within @xmath48 .",
    "most likely this results from differing treatments of the stellar pulsations .",
    "additionally , our posterior distribution for @xmath15 in 2008 is double - peaked , resulting in asymmetric uncertainties on this parameter .",
    "although we did not measure the transit duration directly from our data , we calculated the expected duration using eqn .  3 of @xcite ;",
    "this is shown in table  [ restable ] .",
    "the transit duration implied by our doppler tomographic measurements has changed by 2.7 minutes between the two epochs , a challenging measurement for typical ground - based data , even without the complication of stellar variability .              using our values of @xmath15 and @xmath23 at the two epochs , we calculated the rate of precession .",
    "we used the definition of the argument of the ascending node @xmath49 as given by @xcite , i.e. , the angle between the plane of the sky and the intersection between the planetary orbital plane and a plane parallel to the line of sight which is also perpendicular to the projection of the stellar rotation axis onto the plane of the sky , as measured in this latter plane . see fig .  2 of @xcite for a graphical definition ; note that the quantity they denoted as @xmath50 is our @xmath15 , and their @xmath34 is our @xmath51 .",
    "using this definition and the definition of the impact parameter , @xmath52 , we related @xmath49 to our known quantities with @xmath53 which we used to calculate @xmath49 at the two epochs .",
    "we assumed that @xmath26 remains constant .",
    "we found @xmath0 yr@xmath1 and @xmath2  @xmath3 yr@xmath1 , and calculated a rate of nodal precession of wasp-33  b of @xmath4  @xmath3 yr@xmath1 .",
    "this is in agreement with the prediction of @xcite , @xmath54 yr@xmath1",
    ". a schematic view of the changing transit chord is shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "the observation that both @xmath15 and @xmath23 are changing implies that the total angular momentum vector of the system @xmath55 ( the sum of the stellar spin and planetary orbital momentum vectors ) , about which the planetary orbital angular momentum is precessing , is neither close to perpendicular nor close to parallel to the line of sight .",
    "consider two limiting cases : if @xmath55 were perpendicular to the line of sight , then the precession would manifest as purely a change in @xmath15 , whereas if @xmath55 were parallel to the line of sight , the precession would manifest as purely a change in @xmath23 .",
    "intermediate motion implies an intermediate angle .    using the rate of precession we set limits on the stellar gravitational quadrupole moment @xmath56 .",
    "this is @xmath57 ( e.g , from rearranging eqn .",

    "we have detected the nodal precession of the hot jupiter wasp-33 b , and measured a rate of change of the ascending node of @xmath4 @xmath3 yr@xmath1 .",

    "given the rate of change of the impact parameter of kepler-13 ab found by @xcite and the uncertainty on @xmath15 measured by @xcite , we expect that the precession of kepler-13 ab will be measurable by doppler tomography by 2017",
