    "hierarchical clustering scenarios suggest that present day galaxies assembled from much smaller building blocks during the course of their evolution ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ) .",
    "recent deep surveys have found small dwarf galaxies ( i.e. , building blocks ) at @xmath5 ( e.g. , pascarelle , windhorst , & keel 1998 ; ellis et al . 2001 ; taniguchi et al .",

    "at the present epoch , the assembly process continues with large galaxies capturing their satellite galaxies . in order to understand the mass assembly of galaxies ,",
    "it is therefore important to investigate such minor merger processes in detail .",
    "it is known that most galaxies in the local universe have satellite galaxies ( e.g. , zaritsky et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "satellite galaxies are expected to sink to the center of the potential of their host galaxies due to dynamical friction ( ostriker & tremaine 1975 ; tremaine 1981 ) ; however , satellites with long dynamical friction timescales are still found orbiting their hosts .",
    "the satellites suffer from tidal disruption as they orbit in the galaxy s host dark matter halo .",
    "therefore , the kinematic and morphological properties of the satellites can be used to investigate the structure and potential of the host dark matter halo .",
    "the recent discovery of ultra compact dwarf ( ucds ) galaxies in the fornax cluster suggests that such tidal disruption processes can yield small satellite galaxies ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2000a , 2000b ; bekki , couch , & drinkwater 2001 ; bekki et al",
    "as dwarf galaxies orbit around the host galaxy , their outer stellar components are tidally removed .",
    "this process is also referred to as galaxy threshing . recently , forbes et al .",

    "the acs image clearly shows faint , long tidal tails emanating from a satellite galaxy around an edge - on spiral galaxy at @xmath6 .",
    "although a pair of tidal tails is often found in major mergers ( arp 1966 ; toomre & toomre 1973 ) , it is rare to find such tails in on - going minor mergers . in this respect ,",

    "( 2003 ) provides important information of tidal disruption of satellite galaxies around the host galaxy . following bekki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we use the term  galaxy threshing  for such on - going , tidally - disrupted satellite galaxies .    here , we present the serendipitous discovery of a new potential galaxy threshing system found in the cosmos 2-square degree field ( scoville et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the most important point is that we find clear evidence for the disruption of a small satellite galaxy .",
    "destroyed systems are often observed , but faint tidal remnants are generally too faint to be detected in most cases .",
    "we present the photometric properties of the system and discuss some implications .",
    "we adopt a flat universe with @xmath7@xmath8 , @xmath7@xmath9 , and @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 throughout this paper , and use the ab system for optical magnitudes .",
    "the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) is a treasury program on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , awarded a total of 640 hst orbits , to be carried out in two cycles ( 320 orbits in cycles 12 and 13 each ; scoville et al .",

    "2000 ) . during our two observing runs in january and february 2004",
    ", we obtained @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 band images of the whole cosmos field .",
    "the individual ccd data were reduced and combined using our own data reduction software ( yagi et al .",
    "2002 ) and iraf .",
    "the combined images for individual bands were aligned and smoothed with gaussian kernels to match the atmospheric seeing conditions .",

    "details of the data reduction processes for the cosmos acs data are given in koekemoer et al .",
    "in figure 1 , we show our five broad - band images of the galaxy threshing system .",
    "the threshing system is a pair of interacting galaxies labeled a and b in the @xmath20 band image ( fig .",
    "1 ) . galaxy a appears to be a giant elliptical galaxy while galaxy b appears to be a small satellite disk galaxy .",
    "it is remarkable that very long tidal tails are emanating from galaxy b. these features are quite similar to those found in the first galaxy threshing system reported by forbes et al .",
    "although we have not yet obtained optical spectroscopy of galaxies a and b , their physical association appears to be real , and thus this system is the second case of galaxy threshing . in figure 2",
    ", we show an acs @xmath27 image of this system . in the high resolution hst image , there are many other satellite galaxies around galaxy a. this group has been identified as i d 10203 in sdss by merchn & zandivarez ( 2005 ) , they are all large , bright galaxies ( @xmath28 ) shown in figure 3 .",
    "note that galaxy b is not contained in the sdss catalog , because the spectroscopic redshift of galaxy b was not obtained .      in order to study structural properties of the two galaxies in the threshing system",
    ", we examine their surface brightness distributions using the iraf `` ellipse '' program . in figure 4 , we show the surface brightness profiles of galaxy a as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "it follows a de vaucouleur s @xmath29 law , suggesting that it is an elliptical galaxy , consistent with the sdss spectrum . in figure 5",
    ", we show the surface brightness profile of galaxy b as a function of radius .",
    "it shows an exponential radial profile suggesting that this galaxy is probably a disk galaxy .",
    "next , we derive the apparent magnitudes of the two galaxies using galfit ( peng et al .",
    "we apply a de vaucouleur s @xmath29 model for galaxy a and an exponential disk model for galaxy b. since the central region ( @xmath30 ) of galaxy a is saturated in our @xmath23 band image , we have masked out this region .",
    "the magnitudes and their errors of both galaxies are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the scale length of galaxy b and the effective radius of galaxy a are shown in table 2 and table 3 , respectively .",
    "we also give results for the sersic fitting in table 4 .",
    "the sersic index of galaxy a ranges from @xmath31 2.5 to @xmath31 3 , being smaller than 4 ( which corresponds to a de vaucouleur profile ) .",
    "note that the central region of galaxy a is saturated in @xmath23 , and thus the sersic index may have large uncertainty . on the other hand",
    ", galaxy b has sersic index around 1.4 in each filter .",
    "these results seem to be basically consistent with our interpretation that galaxy a is an elliptical galaxy while galaxy b is a disk galaxy .    at a redshift of 0.08 ( corresponding to a luminosity distance of 363.5 mpc ) , we estimate an absolute @xmath21 magnitude ( luminosity ) of @xmath32 for galaxy a , and of @xmath33 for galaxy b.      we found a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath34 for galaxy a ( sdss j100003.2 + 020146.4 ) in the sdss spectroscopic data archive of third data release ( abazajian et al .",
    "unfortunately , no spectroscopic information on the redshift is available for galaxy b. we derive a photometric redshift for galaxy b using the @xmath35 minimizing method ( e.g. , lanzetta , yahil , & fernndez - soto 1996 ) .",
    "we generate sed ( spectral energy distribution ) templates for @xmath36 with a redshift bin of @xmath37 using the population synthesis model galaxev ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "the seds of local galaxies are well reproduced by models whose star - formation rate declines exponentially ( @xmath38 models ) ; i.e. , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the age of the galaxy and @xmath38 is the time scale of star formation .",
    "we adopt @xmath41 models with a salpeter initial mass function ( a power index of @xmath42 and a stellar mass range of @xmath43 ) and solar metallicity , @xmath44 .",
    "we then calculate seds for ages of @xmath45 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 8 gyr , corresponding to the sed of a starburst , irr , scd , sbc , and elliptical galaxy , respectively .",
    "we adopt a visual extinction of @xmath46 .",
    "note that our threshing system consists of basically nearby galaxies .",
    "therefore , our results should not be affected by metallicity and @xmath47 .",
    "applying this method , we obtain a photometric redshift of the galaxy b as @xmath48 , being consistent with the spectroscopic redshift of the galaxy a. for the rest of the paper , we adopt @xmath49 for the galaxy threshing system ( @xmath50 at @xmath51 ) .",
    "we investigate the morphological properties of the two tidal tails emanating from galaxy b. as shown in figure 1 , the two long tidal tails are obvious in images of all bands , suggesting that they consist of stellar material .",
    "the lengths of the two tidal tails are 58 arcsec for the tail extending towards the galaxy a and 30 arcsec for the counter tail ( east of galaxy b ) .",
    "these values correspond to lengths of 102 kpc and 52 kpc , respectively in the plane of the sky .",
    "the tail extending toward galaxy a appears to be narrower than the counter tail whose width increases with increasing distance from galaxy b. this property is also seen in the first galaxy threshing system found by forbes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in order to study this tendency more quantitatively",
    ", we examine the surface brightness distributions of the tails . in figure 6",
    ", we show the @xmath52-band surface brightness profile perpendicular to the tails for the four spatial positions , a , b , c , and d that are indicated in the right panel of figure 6 .",
    "as shown in the left panel of figure 6 , the tail extending to galaxy a is significantly narrower than the counter one .",
    "the tail widths measured at 3@xmath53 and 5@xmath53 noise level for each position are given in table 5 .",
    "the width at position d exceeds 10 kpc even then it is measured at the 5@xmath53 noise level .",
    "however , the width of the tail extending to galaxy a is only @xmath54 6 - 7 kpc .",
    "there are some knotty structures in the tidal tails .",
    "it is likely that some of these may be tidal dwarf candidates ( e.g. , zwicky 1956 ; schweizer 1978 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 ; yoshida , taniguchi , & murayama 1994 ; duc & mirabel 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "future spectroscopic identification will be necessary to confirm them .",
    "we estimate the mean surface brightness of the tidal tails in a sky area above @xmath55 of the surface brightness in each band .",
    "the errors are estimated using following relation ; @xmath56 @xmath57 is the total number of pixels of tidal tail , and @xmath58 is @xmath59 sky background noise .",
    "the results are given in table 6 .",
    "the mean surface brightness is fainter by @xmath31 1 magnitude than that of the tail found by forbes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we also estimate the total magnitude of the tidal tails in each band .",
    "errors are estimated using following relation ; @xmath60 the results are given in table 6 .",
    "it is found that the magnitude of the tails is comparable to that of galaxy b in each band .    in figure 7 , we show the @xmath61 color distribution in the galaxy threshing system .",
    "the mean @xmath61 color of galaxy a is @xmath62 , while , that of galaxy b is @xmath63 .",
    "there is a small color difference between the main body of galaxy b and the two tidal tails .",
    "this suggests that stars located in the tidal tails were dispersed from the main body of galaxy b , providing strong evidence that galaxy threshing has been occurring in this system .",
    "the total magnitude of the tidal tails is comparable to that of the main body of galaxy b. we estimated that the luminosity of galaxy b is @xmath64 , and that of the tail is @xmath65 .",
    "these luminosities are nearly the same .",
    "this suggests that galaxy b lost about half of its former mass during the ( on - going ) threshing event .",
    "we assume that galaxy a has a mass - to - light ratio of 10 typical for an elliptical galaxies and 3 for galaxy b. given the @xmath21-band luminosity in section 3.1 , we obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67 for a and b , respectively .",
    "next , we estimate the probable pericenter distance ( @xmath68 ) for the galaxy threshing event .",
    "as shown in figure 5 , galaxy b shows an exponential surface brightness profile for @xmath69 arcsec .",
    "if we assume that the mass outside of this radius has been expelled during the previous encounter between the two galaxies , and we use the equation of tidal radius as a rough guide of the pericenter distance , we can then estimate the pericenter as follows , @xmath70 using the derived masses of the two galaxies , we obtain a pericenter distance of @xmath71 kpc .",
    "bekki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) made general numerical simulations of a galaxy threshing systems with @xmath72 kpc .",
    "mayer et al . (",
    "2001 ) used a similar value , @xmath73 kpc .",
    "our estimate is consistent with the results of these numerical simulations .",
    "the projected separation between two galaxies is 102 kpc .",
    "if we adopt an average relative velocity between the two galaxies of 200 km s@xmath11 , we find that the previous encounter occurred @xmath74 yrs ago .",
    "galaxy b found in this study will merge into galaxy a after a few billion years after ( see bekki et al .",
    "2001 ) . even in a facial phase of such minor mergers , faint remnants could be found around the host galaxy .",
    "recently , morphological evidence for such a final phase of minor mergers has been found around field red elliptical galaxies ( van dokkum 2005 ) .",
    "deep optical imaging survey for ordinary - looking galaxies should provide more information on the global , and dynamical evolution of galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the discovery of a new potential galaxy threshing system .",
    "although merging systems and interacting systems are often observed , it is rare to find faint tidal tails in on - going minor mergers because their tidal tails are generally too faint to be detected .",
