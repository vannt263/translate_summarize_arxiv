    "multi - agent systems such as crowds of human @xcite , schools of fish @xcite , flocks of birds @xcite , colonies of molds @xcite and ants @xcite often exhibit discrete phase transitions due to variations of the driven force of interaction among members @xcite .",
    "specially , detecting transitions in humans @xcite is an ongoing research problem @xcite .",
    "abrupt changes upon variation of some parameters such as speed , coordination and structure @xcite shift the system from one state to another @xcite .",
    "numerous types of swarm decisions which determine the group dynamics are not only influenced by the intrinsic social interaction among members @xcite , but also by some outside factors such as threats @xcite and presence of predators or food sources @xcite .",
    "however , with a majority of observation done via videos , the classical approaches of detecting transitions , such as , tracking individuals and monitoring their dynamics , are constrained by the size of the group and the scale of the problem @xcite .",
    "being inspired by manifold representation of collective motion , here , we develop a method of detecting phase transitions in a multi - agent system as it switches from one unique behavior to another .    in manifold theory , we can reveal an invariant manifold , @xmath0 , in an abstract higher dimensional space which describes the collective behavior of a group , such that each frame , partitioned from the collective motion video , corresponds to a point @xmath1 on the manifold @xcite . in this setup",
    ", the whole group evolves according to the underlying flow @xmath2 at time @xmath3 @xcite . due to behavioral changes of the group",
    ", this mapping switches from one phase space to another and indicates a transition of the motion .",
    "thus , in the presence of a phase transition , the system can be represented as two distinct sub - manifolds , @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , along with singularities where the transition physically exists @xcite . here",
    ", the most salient scenario is that the sub - manifolds intersect and make a locus @xmath7 of singularities as @xmath8        as an example , we estimate the dimensionalities of two distinct phases of a human crowd given as a video in @xcite that switches phase from walking ( fig .",

    "a transition in a multi - agent system is defined as a switching of the current smooth embedding manifold into a another smooth manifold with different dimensionality as trajectories of agents evolve in the phase space .",
    "our approach of detecting transitions is based on revealing high curvature on the manifold which differentiate phases of the motion .",
    "we hypothesize that a phase transition is manifested in the form of change in local curvature that can be detected by a ratio of singular values from sampled points .",
    "we first formalize this concept in two dimensions by proving a relation between curvature and singular value ratio in a curve , and then extend it to higher - dimensions by using the shape operator .",
    "then , we justify that the same transition can also be detected by analyzing the ratios of the smallest singular value to the largest singular value which are computed locally upon neighborhoods of points sampled on the manifold . based on the distribution of a moving sum of absolute moving difference of the singular value ratios ,",
    "transitions are detected and their magnitudes are ordered .",
