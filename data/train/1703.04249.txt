    "<S> if a band with even mirror symmetry is higher in energy than a band of odd symmetry at @xmath4 but lower at @xmath5 ( both on the mirror plane ) , then due to the continuity of eigenvalues and differing symmetry , on any path connecting them there must be a point of degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> the locus of such degeneracies maps out either a loop encircling one of the points , or an extended line from zone to zone separating the two points ( which , considering periodicity , also becomes a closed loop topologically ) .    </S>",
