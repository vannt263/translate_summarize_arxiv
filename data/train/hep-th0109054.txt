    "one motivation for considering extra dimensions comes from superstring theory ( or m - theory ) , which is believed to be a consistent theory of quantum gravity .",
    "thus , the critical number of space - time dimensions in superstring theory is 10 ( while m - theory is an 11-dimensional theory ) .",
    "however , in order to model the real world with critical string theory ( or m - theory ) , one must address the question of why the extra dimensions have not been observed .",
    "one way to make extra dimensions consistent with observation is to assume that they are compact with small enough volume .",
    "if the standard model gauge and matter fields propagate in such extra dimensions ( as is the case in , say , weakly coupled heterotic string theory ) , then their linear sizes should not be larger than about inverse tev @xcite . on the other hand , in the brane world scenario the standard model gauge and matter fields are assumed to be localized on branes ( or an intersection thereof ) , while gravity lives in a larger dimensional bulk of space - time .",
    "such a scenario with compact extra dimensions can , for instance , be embedded in superstring theory via type i@xmath2 compactifications .",
    "then the extra directions transverse to the branes can be as large as about a tenth of a millimeter @xcite .",
    "originally considering compact ( or , more generally , finite volume ) extra dimensions was motivated by the requirement that at the distance scales for which gravity has been measured one should reproduce 4-dimensional gravity . however , in @xcite a remarkable proposal was set forward . in particular , according to @xcite 4-dimensional gravity can be reproduced on a 3-brane in infinite - volume bulk ( with 6 or larger space - time dimensions ) up to ultra-_large _ distance scales .",
    "thus , in these scenarios gravity is almost completely localized on a brane ( which is almost @xmath3-function - like ) with ultra - light modes penetrating into the bulk . as was explained in @xcite , this dramatic modification of gravity in higher codimension models with infinite volume extra dimensions",
    "is due to the einstein - hilbert term on the brane , which is induced via loops of non - conformal brane matter @xcite .",
    "in this paper we describe an explicit string theory framework where the standard model gauge and matter fields are localized on ( a collection of ) d3-branes embedded in infinite - volume extra space .",
    "in particular , we consider _ unoriented _ type iib backgrounds in the presence of some number of d3-branes embedded in an orbifolded space - time .",
    "the d3-brane world - volume theory in this framework is non - conformal ( at least for some backgrounds with at most @xmath0 supersymmetry ) . at the quantum level we have the einstein - hilbert term induced on the branes , which leads to almost complete localization of gravity on the d3-branes . in particular , up to an ultra - large cross - over distance scale the gravitational interactions of the standard model fields localized on d3-branes are described by 4-dimensional laws of gravity .",
    "one of the key ingredients in this framework is that we have an unoriented background .",
    "thus , if we consider orientable type iib backgrounds ( that is , those without orientifold planes ) in the presence of some number of d3-branes embedded in an orbifolded space - time , then , as was explained in @xcite , the finiteness of the theory ( that is , tadpole cancellation conditions ) implies that the d3-brane world - volume theory is necessarily conformal supersymmetry are conformal @xcite . as to non - supersymmetric theories , to decouple bulk tachyons one considers the large @xmath4 limit , where they too are conformal . ] .",
    "however , as was originally pointed out in @xcite , we can obtain _ non - conformal _ gauge theories if we consider orientifolds of such type iib backgrounds .",
    "in particular , this is the case for backgrounds with at most @xmath0 supersymmetry . given the importance of orientifold planes in our framework , we refer to it as `` orientiworld '' .",
    "the orientiworld framework appears to have a rich structure for model building .",
    "in particular , since the extra dimensions have infinite volume , the number of d3-branes is arbitrary .",
    "moreover , the number of allowed orbifold groups is infinite .",
    "thus , _ a priori _ the orbifold group can be an arbitrary subgroup of @xmath5 , or , if we require @xmath0 supersymmetry to avoid bulk tachyons , of @xmath6 . to obtain a finite string background ,",
    "we still must impose _ twisted _ tadpole cancellation conditions .",
    "however , twisted tadpoles must also be canceled in compact type iib orientifolds .",
    "then the number of consistent solutions of the latter type is rather limited @xcite as we can only have a finite number of d3-branes , and , moreover , the number of allowed orbifold groups is also finite as they must act crystallographically on the compact space . on the other hand ,",
    "as we already mentioned , in the orientiworld framework the number of consistent solutions is _ infinite _ , which is encouraging for phenomenologically oriented model building .",
    "this richness of the orientiworld framework can be exploited to construct various models for phenomenological applications .",
    "we discuss some examples of orientiworld models in detail .",
    "in particular , we give an example with three chiral generations . in this model , which is @xmath0 supersymmetric ,",
    "the gauge group contains a phenomenologically appealing @xmath1 subgroup .",
    "albeit the gauge group in this model contains an @xmath1 subgroup , as was pointed out in @xcite , it is not a grand unified model as we have no higgs field in an appropriate higher dimensional representation .",
    "however , as was pointed out in @xcite , one can still break the gauge group down to that of the standard model .",
    "we discuss this model in detail , and point out the importance of the gauge subgroups coming from d7-branes , which are also present in this model . in particular , the d7-brane gauge symmetry becomes part of the four - dimensional gauge symmetry via the mechanism of @xcite .",
    "in fact , after a sequence of higgsing , the gauge group in this model can be broken down to the pati - salam gauge group .",
    "the charged matter contains 3 chiral generations of quarks and leptons , the electroweak higgs doublets , as well as the pati - salam higgs fields , which break the pati - salam gauge symmetry down to that of the standard model .",
    "we also point out a pleasant bonus in this model - the superpotential is such that we have precisely one heavy ( top - like ) generation .    given recent developments in brane world scenarios with infinite - volume extra dimensions",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that the orientiworld approach , which provides an explicit framework for consistently embedding such scenarios in string theory , would have to be further developed . in particular , orbifold examples are only a part of interesting starting type iib backgrounds .",
    "thus , one can consider more general backgrounds such as conifolds .",
    "it therefore appears that orientiworld might provide a fruitful arena for embedding various brane world scenarios in string theory .",
    "in fact , in the following we point out that relevant ( as opposed to marginal ) blow - ups of the orbifold singularities , which turn the space transverse to the d3-branes into a conifold , play an important role in obtaining 4-dimensional gravity on d3-branes .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the orientiworld framework .",
    "in section iii we discuss some general features of the orientiworld scenario , in particular , we discuss how 4-dimensional gravity is reproduced on d3-branes . in section",
    "iv we discuss how the four - dimensional einstein - hilbert term arises in the orientiworld context . in section",
    "v we discuss concrete examples of orientiworld models . in section",
    "vi we discuss some phenomenological aspects of the aforementioned 3-family supersymmetric model containing an @xmath1 subgroup .",
    "we conclude with final remarks in section vii .",
    "some details are relegated to appendices .",
    "in this section we discuss the orientiworld framework .",
    "first we describe the underlying oriented type iib orbifold backgrounds .",
    "we then consider their orientifolds .",
    "this illustrates why introduction of orientifold planes makes a big difference , in particular , why in the orientiworld framework we can construct non - conformal gauge theories . parts of our discussion here will closely follow @xcite .",
    "consider type iib string theory with @xmath4 parallel coincident d3-branes where the space transverse to the d - branes is @xmath7 .",
    "the orbifold group @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) must be a finite discrete subgroup of @xmath5 ( it can be a subgroup of @xmath5 and not @xmath10 as we are dealing with a theory containing fermions ) . if @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , we have @xmath0 ( @xmath13 ) unbroken supersymmetry , and @xmath14 , otherwise .",
    "let us confine our attention to the cases where type iib on @xmath15 is a modular invariant theory . for non - supersymmetric cases",
    "this is also true provided that @xmath16 . if @xmath17 , then modular invariance requires that the set of points in @xmath18 fixed under the @xmath19 twist has real dimension 2 . ] .",
    "the action of the orbifold on the coordinates @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) on @xmath15 can be described in terms of @xmath10 matrices : @xmath22 .",
    "( the action of @xmath23 on the world - sheet superpartners of @xmath20 is the same . )",
    "we also need to specify the action of the orbifold group on the chan - paton charges carried by the d3-branes .",
    "it is described by @xmath24 matrices @xmath25 that form a representation of @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath27 is an identity matrix and @xmath28 .",
    "the d - brane sector of the theory is described by an _ oriented _",
    "open string theory .",
    "in particular , the world - sheet expansion corresponds to summing over oriented riemann surfaces with arbitrary genus @xmath29 and arbitrary number of boundaries @xmath30 , where the boundaries of the world - sheet correspond to the d3-branes .",
    "for example , consider the one - loop vacuum amplitude with no handles and two boundaries ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the corresponding graph is an annulus whose boundaries lie on d3-branes .",
    "the one - loop partition function in the light - cone gauge is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fermion number operator , @xmath35 is the real modular parameter of the annulus , and the trace includes sum over the chan - paton factors .",
    "the orbifold group @xmath26 acts on both ends of the open string .",
    "the action of @xmath36 on chan - paton charges is given by @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the individual terms in the sum in ( [ partition ] ) have the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are characters corresponding to the world - sheet degrees of freedom .",
    "the `` untwisted '' character @xmath40 is the same as in the @xmath41 theory for which @xmath42 .",
    "the information about the fact that the orbifold theory has reduced supersymmetry is encoded in the `` twisted '' characters @xmath39 , @xmath43 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the one - loop massless ( and , in non - supersymmetric cases , tachyonic ) tadpole cancellation conditions ( that is , finiteness of the corresponding string backgrounds ) require that @xmath44 that is , all twisted characters @xmath39 contain divergences ( which are all massless tadpoles in the supersymmetric cases , while in non - supersymmetric cases we also have tachyonic divergences ) .",
    "in @xcite it was also shown that this condition implies that the chan - paton matrices @xmath25 form an @xmath45-fold copy of the _ regular _ representation of @xmath26 .",
    "the regular representation decomposes into a direct sum of all irreducible representations @xmath46 of @xmath26 with degeneracy factors @xmath47 .",
    "the gauge group is ( @xmath48 ) @xmath49 the matter consists of weyl fermions and scalars transforming in bifundamentals @xmath50 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the overall center - of - mass @xmath51 is free - matter fields are not charged under this @xmath51 .",
    "all other @xmath51 s , however , are running .",
    "if @xmath52 , then these @xmath51 s are anomaly free . if , however , @xmath53 but @xmath54 , then some of such @xmath51 factors are actually anomalous ( in particular , we have @xmath55 mixed anomalies ) , and are broken at the tree - level via a generalized green - schwarz mechanism @xcite . apart from the @xmath51 factors , all supersymmetric theories of this type are conformal @xcite , in particular , their non - abelian parts are conformal factors in the next subsection . ] . on the other hand , in non - supersymmetric cases to decouple bulk tachyons one considers the large @xmath4 limit together with @xmath56 while keeping @xmath57 fixed . ] .",
    "all ( supersymmetric as well as non - supersymmetric ) gauge theories of this type are conformal in the large @xmath4 limit @xcite .",
    "the key reason for this conformal property is the tadpole cancellation condition ( [ tadpole ] ) , which , as was explained in @xcite , implies that all planar diagrams reduce to those of the parent @xmath41 theory , which is conformal . in the large @xmath4 limit",
    "non - planar diagrams are suppressed by powers of @xmath58 . for finite @xmath4 conformality of the non - abelian parts of the gauge theories",
    "follows for @xmath13 cases ( as @xmath13 gauge theories perturbatively are not renormalized beyond one loop ) , and can also be argued for @xmath0 cases @xcite . in non - supersymmetric cases , however , bulk tachyons prevent one from considering finite @xmath4 cases limit the bulk tachyons are harmless as the string coupling @xmath59 goes to zero . ] .",
    "let us now consider a generalization of the above setup by including orientifold planes . in the following we will mostly be interested in finite @xmath4 theories , so",
    "let us focus on theories with at least @xmath0 unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "thus , consider type iib string theory on @xmath60 where @xmath11 .",
    "consider the @xmath61 orientifold of this theory , where @xmath62 is the world - sheet parity reversal , and @xmath63 is a @xmath19 element ( @xmath64 ) acting on the complex coordinates @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) on @xmath67 such that the set of points in @xmath67 fixed under the action of @xmath63 has real dimension @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath68 then we have an orientifold 3-plane .",
    "if @xmath26 has a @xmath19 subgroup , then we also have an orientifold 7-plane .",
    "if @xmath70 then we have an orientifold 7-plane .",
    "we may also have an orientifold 3-plane depending on whether @xmath26 has an appropriate @xmath19 subgroup . regardless of whether we have an orientifold 3-plane , we can _ a priori _ introduce an arbitrary number of d3-branes . on the other hand , if we have an orientifold 7-plane we must introduce 8 of the corresponding d7-branes to cancel the ramond - ramond charge appropriately .",
    "( the number 8 of d7-branes is required by the corresponding untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions . )",
    "we need to specify the action of @xmath26 on the chan - paton factors corresponding to the d3- and d7-branes ( if the latter are present , which is the case if we have an orientifold 7-plane ) . just as in the previous subsection",
    ", these are given by chan - paton matrices which we collectively refer to as @xmath71 , where the superscript @xmath72 refers to the corresponding d3- or d7-branes .",
    "note that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of d - branes labelled by @xmath72 .    at the one - loop level",
    "there are three different sources for massless tadpoles : the klein bottle , annulus and mbius strip amplitudes depicted in fig.1 .",
    "the klein bottle amplitude corresponds to the contribution of unoriented closed strings into the one - loop vacuum diagram .",
    "it can be alternatively viewed as a tree - level closed string amplitude where the closed strings propagate between two cross - caps .",
    "the latter are the ( coherent type iib ) states that describe the familiar orientifold planes .",
    "the annulus amplitude corresponds to the contribution of open strings stretched between two d - branes into the one - loop vacuum amplitude .",
    "it can also be viewed as a tree - channel closed string amplitude where the closed strings propagate between two d - branes .",
    "finally , the mbius strip amplitude corresponds to the contribution of unoriented open strings into the one - loop vacuum diagram .",
    "it can be viewed as a tree - channel closed string amplitude where the closed strings propagate between a d - brane and an orientifold plane .",
    "note that there are no chan - paton matrices associated with the klein bottle amplitude since it corresponds to closed strings propagating between two cross - caps which do not carry chan - paton charges .",
    "the mbius strip has only one boundary .",
    "this implies that the individual terms ( corresponding to twists @xmath36 ) in the mbius strip amplitude are proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "the annulus amplitude is the same ( up to an overall factor of @xmath76 due to the orientation reversal projection ) as in the oriented case discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "thus , the individual terms ( corresponding to twists @xmath36 ) in the annulus amplitude are proportional to @xmath77 . the tadpoles can therefore be written as @xmath78 here the terms with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 correspond to the contributions of the klein bottle , mbius strip and annulus amplitudes , respectively .",
    "in fact , the factorization property of string theory implies that the klein bottle amplitude should factorize into two cross - caps connected via a long thin tube .",
    "the mbius strip amplitude should factorize into a cross - cap and a disc connected via a long thin tube .",
    "similarly , the annulus amplitude should factorize into two discs connected via a long thin tube .",
    "these factorizations are depicted in fig.2 .",
    "the implication of this for the tadpoles is that they too factorize into a sum of perfect squares @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the _ twisted _ tadpole cancellation conditions read : @xmath86 these should be contrasted with ( [ tadpole ] ) in the oriented case . in particular , since in certain cases some @xmath87 , _ a priori _ there is no reason why the corresponding d3-brane world - volume gauge theories should be conformal .",
    "that is , the presence of orientifold planes can indeed give rise to non - conformal gauge theories .",
    "let us see what kind of orientiworld models we can have . in particular ,",
    "let us discuss what kind of orientiworld models are non - conformal .",
    "for definiteness let us focus on the cases where we do have an orientifold 3-plane .",
    "if there are no orientifold 7-planes ( that is , if @xmath26 does not contain a @xmath19 element ) , then the orientifold projection @xmath62 can be either of the @xmath88 or the @xmath89 type : the corresponding orientifold 3-plane is referred to as o3@xmath90 or o3@xmath91 , respectively .",
    "that is , before orbifolding , if we place @xmath92 d3-branes on top of the o3@xmath90-plane ( o3@xmath91-plane ) , we have the @xmath93 super - yang - mills theory with the @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) gauge group d3-branes on top of the o3@xmath90-plane to obtain the @xmath96 gauge group . ] .",
    "( we are using the convention where @xmath95 has rank @xmath4 . ) after the orbifold projections the 33 ( that is , the d3-brane ) gauge group is a subgroup of @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , which can contain @xmath97 factors as well as @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) subgroups .",
    "the 33 matter can contain bifundamentals in any of these subgroups as well as rank-2 antisymmetric ( symmetric ) representations in the unitary subgroups .",
    "next , if we have an o7-plane , the orientifold projection @xmath62 must always be of the @xmath88 type on the d7-branes - this is required by the tadpole cancellation condition .",
    "this , in particular , implies that the 33 and 77 matter can not contain rank-2 symmetric representations . note that we also have 37 matter in bifundamentals of the 33 and 77 gauge groups .",
    "let us start with @xmath13 theories of this type .",
    "all such theories are conformal ( more precisely , their non - abelian parts are - here we are ignoring the @xmath51 factors ) . the reason why can be understood as follows .",
    "first , note that we can focus on the one - loop level as we have @xmath13 supersymmetry .",
    "it can be shown that cross - cap contributions to the twisted tadpoles corresponding to the twists of even order are all vanishing ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this implies that the corresponding @xmath98 are traceless , and , for the same reason as in the previous subsection , do not spoil conformality .",
    "let us therefore focus on orbifold groups @xmath99 that do not contain elements of even order .",
    "these are given by @xmath100 subgroups of @xmath12 , where @xmath101 is odd .",
    "let us see why all such theories are conformal ( we can then understand why theories with even order twists are also conformal ) . in these theories",
    "the cross - cap contributions into twisted tadpoles , which are given by the factors @xmath102 , are non - vanishing , so neither are the corresponding @xmath103 ( note that in these cases we have no d7-branes , so we do not need to put an additional index @xmath72 on the chan - paton matrices ) .",
    "however , the tadpole cancellation condition implies that @xmath104 this , as we will see in a moment , implies that these @xmath13 theories are conformal .    to see this ,",
    "let us consider renormalization of the gauge coupling for a _ non - abelian _ subgroup of the d3-brane gauge group .",
    "this can be deduced from a 2-point function , where two gauge bosons corresponding to this subgroup are attached to the _ same _ boundary in the corresponding one - loop graph .",
    "it has to be the same boundary because these are non - abelian gauge bosons , so the chan - paton matrices @xmath105 , @xmath106 , corresponding to the external lines are traceless : @xmath107 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath108 as well for by definition @xmath105 are invariant under the orbifold group action as @xmath105 correspond to the gauge bosons of the gauge group left unbroken by the orbifold ( in particular , note that @xmath105 commute with @xmath25 ) .",
    "this then implies that attaching only one such external line to a given boundary would produce a vanishing amplitude .",
    "note that this is correct for the non - abelian gauge bosons , but does not hold for @xmath51 factors .",
    "this , as we will see , is precisely the reason why @xmath51 s can still run in these theories .",
    "thus , the _ ultra - violet _ divergence structure for the one - loop amplitude containing two external lines corresponding to non - abelian gauge bosons is given by : @xmath109~,\\ ] ] where the first term comes from the mbius strip , while the second term comes from the annulus .",
    "in the second term the factor of 2 is due to the two different ways we can attach external gauge bosons to the two boundaries .",
    "the factors @xmath102 and @xmath110 are the same as before - they correspond to the _ massless _ twisted closed string states coupling to the cross - caps and d3-branes , respectively , in the factorization limit depicted in fig.2 .",
    "the factors @xmath111 correspond to these twisted closed string states coupling to the d3-branes with two external lines attached to them ( in particular , @xmath111 are different from @xmath110 ) .",
    "note that ( [ coupling ] ) vanishes due to the tadpole cancellation conditions ( [ tadpole1 ] ) .",
    "that is , we have _ no _ ultra - violet divergences in the one - loop 2-point functions involving non - abelian gauge bosons .",
    "the fact that there are no ultra - violet divergences in the non - abelian 2-point functions does not by itself imply that the non - abelian gauge couplings do not run .",
    "indeed , we must show that there are no _ infra - red _ divergences in the corresponding 2-point functions either .",
    "remarkably enough , however , the ultra - violet and infra - red divergences in these @xmath13 models are related to each other , in fact , they are _",
    "identical_. the reason for this is the following .",
    "consider the _ loop - channel _ one - loop 2-point function involving non - abelian or @xmath51 gauge bosons ( in the latter case we must also include the annulus amplitude with the external lines attached to two different boundaries ) .",
    "such an amplitude receives contributions only from _",
    "open string states running in the loop .",
    "this is due to the @xmath13 supersymmetry - only bps states ( that is , those in short supermultiplets ) can contribute to the renormalization of the gauge couplings , and the massive open string excitations in these backgrounds are all non - bps @xcite .",
    "that is , there are no massive string threshold contributions to the gauge couplings , and whatever their field - theoretic logarithmic running , it continues above the string scale . in other words ,",
    "the massive open string states do _ not _ provide an ultra - violet cut - off for the gauge coupling running in these backgrounds .",
    "this then implies that , if we had logarithmic infra - red divergences in the non - abelian gauge couplings ( that is , if the latter did run ) , we would have to have the corresponding logarithmic ultra - violet divergences as well .",
    "however , as we saw above , there are no ultra - violet divergences in the non - abelian gauge couplings .",
    "this then implies that there are no infra - red divergences either , and the non - abelian gauge couplings do _ not _ run - the non - abelian parts of these @xmath13 gauge theories are , therefore , conformal .    what about the @xmath51 gauge couplings",
    "first , note that @xmath51 s in these backgrounds are non - anomalous - these theories are @xmath13 supersymmetric , and , therefore , non - chiral .",
    "so _ a priori _ they need not be broken .",
    "we can then discuss the @xmath51 gauge coupling running .",
    "in fact , all @xmath51 s run as there is always matter charged under them which is free . in the oriented case",
    "the gauge group before orbifolding is @xmath112 , and the free center - of - mass @xmath51 is inherited from this @xmath112 ( while all the other @xmath51 s come from breaking the @xmath113 part of @xmath112 , so there is always matter charged under these @xmath51 s , which , therefore , run ) . on the other hand , in the unoriented case the gauge group before orbifolding is @xmath94 or @xmath95 ( as we have already mentioned , it can also be @xmath96 ) , and in this case @xmath51 s come from breaking these gauge groups , so there is always matter charged under them . ] .",
    "this implies that we have logarithmic _ infra - red _ divergences in the _ loop - channel _ one - loop 2-point function involving @xmath51 gauge bosons .",
    "according to the above argument , this then implies that we must also have the corresponding logarithmic _ ultra - violet _ divergences .",
    "and we do .",
    "these arise in the annulus amplitude with two external @xmath51 lines attached to _ different _ boundaries .",
    "in fact , the corresponding infra - red divergence also arises in this amplitude , that is , we have no infra - red divergences in the mbius strip or annulus amplitudes with two external @xmath51 lines attached to the same boundary . on the other hand , the aforementioned ultra - violet divergence in the loop channel can be understood as an infra - red divergence in the corresponding tree channel , which arises in the factorization limit depicted in fig.2 due to the exchange of _ massless _ twisted states ( note that massive states do not give rise to infra - red divergences in the tree channel ) .",
    "such a massless twisted state is a ramond - ramond twisted 2-form , call it @xmath114 , which on top of the four dimensions along the d3-brane world - volumes also propagates in the fixed point locus of the corresponding twist in @xmath67 , which has real dimension 2 .",
    "this twisted 2-form has a coupling to a @xmath51 gauge field strength of the following form @xcite : @xmath115 exchanging this 2-form in the annulus amplitude with two @xmath51 gauge bosons attached to different boundaries then leads to a logarithmic divergence .",
    "the reason why this divergence is logarithmic is simply due to the fact that the massless 2-dimensional euclidean propagator is logarithmic .",
    "we will come back to the running of the @xmath51 s in a minute .",
    "however , let us first understand the loop - channel infra - red divergences ( in particular , the absence thereof for non - abelian gauge couplings ) in the tree - channel language .",
    "the key point here is that , as we have already mentioned , in these backgrounds the ultra - violet and infra - red divergences in any given one - loop 2-point function are _",
    "thus , the ultra - violet and infra - red divergences in the annulus amplitude with two non - abelian gauge bosons attached to the same boundary are identical .",
    "similarly , they are identical in the mbius strip amplitude with two external lines corresponding to non - abelian gauge bosons .",
    "also , the ultra - violet and infra - red divergences are identical in the annulus amplitude with two @xmath51 gauge bosons attached to the same boundary .",
    "similarly , they are identical in the mbius strip amplitude with two external lines corresponding to @xmath51 gauge bosons",
    ". finally , the ultra - violet and infra - red divergences are identical in the annulus amplitude with two @xmath51 gauge bosons attached to different boundaries .",

    "in fact , the divergences in the annulus amplitude with two @xmath51 gauge bosons attached to different boundaries do not vanish even for the twists with @xmath117 .    to understand how this is possible , that is , how individual infra - red and ultra - violet divergences in these backgrounds can be identical , let us go to the tree channel .",
    "the loop - channel ultra - violet divergences are then translated into the tree - channel infra - red divergences arising due to the exchange of massless twisted states in the factorization limit depicted in fig.2 .",
    "these divergences are logarithmic as the massless 2-dimensional euclidean propagator is logarithmic .",
    "note that the exchange of massless twisted states in the tree channel also gives rise to logarithmic ultra - violet divergences , which in the loop channel translate into logarithmic infra - red divergences .",

    "this then gives us a hint that , if the @xmath51 s become massive , then we should no longer have ultra - violet divergences .",
    "in fact , in a moment we will discuss a mechanism for this .",

    "this mechanism is essentially the same in the oriented as well as unoriented backgrounds , so for simplicity we will discuss it in one of the oriented @xmath13 backgrounds discussed in subsection a.    thus , consider the oriented background with @xmath118 , where the generator @xmath119 of @xmath26 acts as follows on the complex coordinates @xmath120 on @xmath67 : @xmath121 we must satisfy the condition @xmath122 .",

    "let us , however , check that our expectation about the absence of the ultra - violet divergences is actually correct .",
    "what we need to do is to compute the correction to the @xmath156 kinetic term due to the tree - channel exchange of the 2-form @xmath129 .",
    "the relevant action reads : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the field strength of the 2-form @xmath129 in the bulk , which is the d3-brane world - volume times the fixed point locus of the twist @xmath119 .",
    "the computation of this tree - channel exchange is given in appendix a. as can be seen from this computation , we indeed do not have logarithmic divergences in the @xmath128 gauge coupling even if we take the limit @xmath159 where @xmath160 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this is that @xmath128 should _ not _ be interpreted as a local gauge symmetry but as a _",
    "global _ one .",
    "in particular , suppose we start from the original background with a massless @xmath128 gauge boson .",
    "since this @xmath128 runs , we must introduce an ultra - violet cut - off @xmath161 . since the 2-form @xmath129 couples to the brane fields via ( [ cs1 ] ) , already at the one - loop level a kinetic term ( [ kinetic ] ) for @xmath129 will be generated on the d3-branes . at the one - loop order the relevant couplings in ( [ cs1 ] ) are those quadratic in the field strengths : @xmath162~.\\ ] ] in fact , the coefficient @xmath163 in ( [ kinetic ] )",
    "is given by : @xmath164 where @xmath30 is a dimensionless numerical coefficient .",
    "the computation of appendix a then shows that we do not have a logarithmic divergence in the @xmath128 gauge coupling even in the @xmath165 limit .",
    "this , as we have already mentioned , suggests that @xmath128 should be treated as a global symmetry and not as a local one .",
    "in fact , in appendix a we point out that this is consistent with the case where the two extra dimensions @xmath142 are compactified on a large 2-torus .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the story in unoriented backgrounds is similar .",
    "once we interpret all @xmath51 s as global symmetries , we are left with @xmath13 superconformal non - abelian gauge theories on d3-branes .",
    "as should be clear from our discussions , the key reason why @xmath13 theories are conformal lies in the fact that all non - trivial twists have fixed point loci of real dimension 2 . in particular , the fact that the ultra - violet and infra - red divergences in these backgrounds are identical is possible precisely because they are identical in a massless 2-dimensional euclidean propagator supersymmetry are the key ingredients here - the latter ensures that the massive states do not contribute . ] .",
    "this gives us a hint that all @xmath0 theories with the orbifold groups @xmath52 should also be conformal .",
    "indeed , each individual twist @xmath166 in these cases has a fixed point locus of real dimension 2 , moreover , each individual twist @xmath167 , so it preserves @xmath13 supersymmetry ( however , at least two different twists belong to two _ different _",
    "@xmath12 s , so altogether we have only @xmath0 supersymmetry as @xmath168 ) .",
    "it is then not difficult to see that the one - loop non - abelian @xmath169-functions vanish in these theories . clearly ,",
    "since these theories are not @xmath13 supersymmetric , the one - loop vanishing of the corresponding @xmath169-functions does not guarantee that they are conformal at higher loops .",
    "actually , it is not difficult to show that in such theories even two - loop non - abelian @xmath169-functions vanish . indeed , this would follow from the vanishing of the one - loop @xmath169-functions plus the vanishing of the one - loop anomalous scaling dimensions for the non - abelian matter fields .",
    "the latter fact can be shown by repeating the above arguments for matter fields .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath0 cases one can argue that these theories are conformal ( even at finite @xmath4 ) by adapting the corresponding arguments given in @xcite in the case of oriented theories .",
    "before we move onto other @xmath0 theories , let us note the following about @xmath0 theories with @xmath170 .",
    "first , the @xmath51 factors are all anomaly free in such theories ( and should be treated as global symmetries just as in the @xmath13 cases ) .",
    "this , actually , follows from the fact that all such theories are _ non - chiral_. since such theories are not phenomenologically appealing , regardless of their conformality we would have to move onto @xmath0 theories with @xmath54 .",
    "as we will now discuss , such theories are not conformal .",
    "thus , consider the cases where @xmath11 but @xmath171 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath172 such that the corresponding fixed point loci have real dimension 0 .",
    "let us focus on such twists , and discuss their contributions to the one - loop running of the gauge couplings .",
    "let us first discuss the loop - channel ultra - violet divergences , which translate into the tree - channel infra - red divergences due to the exchange of massless twisted states corresponding to such twists .",
    "these massless divergences are no longer logarithmic but _ quadratic _ ( in energy or inverse length - in terms of the real modular parameter on the annulus the corresponding divergence is of the form @xmath173 at @xmath174 ) .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the twisted closed string states propagating in the tree channel live at the fixed _",
    "point_. then , if the external lines correspond to _ massless _ on - shell states , the massless twisted state in the tree - channel exchange is also on - shell , and its propagator @xmath175 is quadratically divergent .",
    "note , however , that these quadratic divergences cancel not only in the vacuum amplitude but also in the two - point one - loop amplitudes with two non - abelian gauge bosons attached to the same boundary . as in the previous subsection",
    ", this cancellation occurs between the annulus and mbius strip amplitudes .",
    "in fact , the quadratic divergence structure is precisely of the form ( [ coupling ] ) .",
    "this then implies that all such quadratic divergences cancel .",
    "this is just as well - in consistent backgrounds we should have no quadratic divergences in a four - dimensional non - abelian gauge boson propagator .",
    "in fact , such quadratic divergences also cancel in all other 2-point amplitudes involving non - abelian matter fields as they should in a consistent @xmath0 supersymmetric theory .",
    "as should be clear from our previous remarks , the same , however , does not hold for @xmath51 factors .",
    "in fact , for the models with @xmath176 but @xmath54 we always have at least one @xmath51 factor in the d3-brane world - volume .",
    "let us therefore consider 2-point functions involving such a @xmath51 factor .",
    "thus , at the one - loop level , for the diagrams where we attach both external lines corresponding to a @xmath51 gauge boson to the same boundary , we have a cancellation between the annulus and mbius strip amplitudes just as in the case of non - abelian gauge bosons .",
    "there is , however , another diagram we must consider , namely , the annulus diagram with the two external lines attached to _ different _ boundaries .",
    "( note that we do not have the corresponding mbius strip amplitude as the latter has only one boundary . )",
    "this annulus amplitude _ does _ contain a quadratic divergence due to a massless twisted closed string exchange .",
    "thus , we have at least one ramond - ramond twisted 2-form , call it @xmath114 , living at the fixed _ point _ in @xmath67 ( recall that in these models we always have a twist with a fixed point locus of real dimension 0 ) .",
    "this twisted 2-form has a coupling to the @xmath51 field strength of the following form : @xmath115 exchanging this 2-form in the annulus amplitude with two @xmath51 gauge bosons attached to different boundaries leads to a quadratic divergence .",
    "the presence of this quadratic divergence is due to the fact that at least one @xmath51 factor in such backgrounds is actually _ anomalous _ @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have a cubic @xmath177 anomaly ( note that all such theories are actually _ chiral _ ) .",
    "the anomalous @xmath51 s in such backgrounds are broken at the tree level via a generalized green - schwarz mechanism involving twisted closed string states @xcite .",
    "in particular , we now have a tree - level kinetic term for the twisted 2-forms @xmath114 , which propagate in the d3-brane world - volume .",
    "the anomalous @xmath51 s then become massive , and we have the corresponding global @xmath51 symmetries at the orbifold point ( that is , if we do not blow up the orbifold ) .",
    "this then takes care of the aforementioned quadratic divergences .",
    "in fact , to begin with these divergences appeared because of an artificial separation of the physical degrees of freedom in massive @xmath51 s .",
    "let us now turn to the loop - channel infra - red divergences , which translate into the tree - channel ultra - violet divergences .",
    "in particular , let us discuss such divergences in the non - abelian gauge couplings .",
    "the key point here is that , unlike in the @xmath13 models discussed in the previous subsection , here the massive open string states do contribute into the gauge coupling renormalization ( in particular , we have massive string threshold corrections ) .",
    "in fact , they provide an effective ultra - violet cut - off in the loop channel @xcite .",
    "there are , however , _",
    "infra - red _ divergences in the loop channel . once again , unlike in the @xmath13 models , here the ultra - violet and infra - red divergence structures are _ different_. in particular , in the tree channel the massive twisted states now do contribute into ultra - violet divergences . in the loop channel",
    "this translates into _ logarithmic _ infra - red divergences corresponding to the non - abelian gauge coupling running .",
    "that is , all models with @xmath11 but @xmath54 are actually _ non - conformal_. in particular , the one - loop @xmath169-function coefficients in these theories are non - vanishing @xcite .",
    "thus , we can obtain d3-brane theories which are both chiral and non - conformal if we consider orientiworld models with @xmath11 but @xmath54 .",
    "before we end this subsection , let us make the following observations .",
    "let us assume that we have an o3-plane . in the cases where @xmath26 contains a @xmath19 element we also have the corresponding o7-plane as well as d7-branes .",
    "at the _ tree level _",
    "the d7-brane gauge symmetry serves as a _",
    "symmetry for the d3-brane gauge theory .",
    "in particular , we have 37 bifundamental matter , which , from the four - dimensional viewpoint , appears as matter transforming in the fundamental representations of various 33 gauge subgroups that also carries global quantum numbers with the corresponding global symmetry identified with the 77 gauge symmetry .",
    "however , already at the one - loop level we have kinetic terms for the 77 gauge bosons generated in the d3-brane world - volume .",
    "that is , the full four - dimensional gauge group contains a subgroup corresponding to the original 77 gauge group .",
    "more precisely , in chiral models with @xmath11 but @xmath54 we have anomalous 77 @xmath51 s on the d3-branes .",
    "these @xmath51 s are then broken .",
    "however , the non - abelian part of the 77 gauge group becomes part of the four - dimensional gauge symmetry .",
    "one interesting feature of the orientiworld framework we described in the previous section is that we can construct models with non - conformal gauge theories in the d3-brane world - volumes .",
    "following @xcite we then expect that the einstein - hilbert term ( among other terms ) will be generated on the d3-branes ( we will discuss this point in more detail in the next section ) . then , since d3-branes are codimension-6 objects , following @xcite , we expect almost completely localized gravity on d3-branes with ultra - light modes penetrating into the bulk . in this section",
    "we would like to discuss this phenomenon in the orientiworld context .    to understand how such dramatic modification of gravity occurs in the orientiworld context",
    ", we will first consider a simplified model . in this model",
    "the 3-brane on which the standard model fields are localized is assumed to be tensionless .",
    "this assumption , however , is not expected to affect the main conclusions of our discussion .",
    "in fact , recently in @xcite it was argued in the case of non - zero tension codimension-2 branes that almost complete localization of gravity still takes place on such branes .",
    "we then may expect the same to hold for higher codimension branes as well - function - like , the background is badly singular at the location of the brane .",

    "let us discuss this possibility in a bit more detail . for simplicity we will focus on the case where the manifold @xmath202 is flat : @xmath204",
    ".      smoothing out the brane in the presence of gravity is non - trivial .",
    "thus , as was originally pointed out in @xcite , not only do we expect the einstein - hilbert term to be generated on the brane , but also other terms , in particular , those involving the graviscalar as well as graviphoton components .",
    "moreover , we actually expect that an infinite series of non - local terms will be present on the brane .",
    "various non - trivial issues arise in this context , which are outside of the scope of this paper , and will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . however , a simple prescription for smoothing out the brane , which we will discuss in a moment , will suffice for our purposes here - function limit .",
    "in fact , in the following we will argue that it appears to be necessary to include some of such terms for consistency . ] .",
    "thus , we will simply replace the @xmath3-function - like brane @xmath188 , which is a point - like object in @xmath202 , by an extended object @xmath267 in @xmath202 .",

    "@xmath142 ) .",
    "similarly , the coupling to brane matter is given by the term @xmath272 where the energy - momentum tensor for the brane matter is conserved in the @xmath187-dimensional sense @xmath273 and is _ independent _ of the coordinates @xmath142 .    a straightforward guess for smoothing out the brane",
    "would be to choose @xmath267 to be a @xmath178-dimensional object in @xmath202 .",

    "the twist @xmath374 acts as follows on the complex coordinates @xmath375 on @xmath376 : @xmath377 where @xmath378 .",
    "now consider the @xmath61 orientifold of type iib on @xmath368 , where @xmath63 acts on the complex coordinates @xmath120 as follows ( @xmath379 is the complex coordinate on @xmath369 ) : @xmath380 note that @xmath63 has four fixed points in @xmath368 .",
    "these are located at @xmath381 and @xmath382 we will place an o3@xmath90-plane at each of these points .    the twisted closed string states have non - trivial couplings to the orientifold planes , which gives rise to tadpoles .",

    "ii , the massive string thresholds do not contribute into the four - dimensional gauge coupling renormalization .",
    "the four - dimensional field theory description is therefore adequate up the the open string _ winding _ threshold @xcite ( see appendix a for details ) , whose mass is given by @xmath396 .",
    "the four - dimensional gauge theory cut - off , therefore , is given by ( up to a dimensionless numerical coefficient , which is subtraction scheme dependent ) : @xmath397 our field theory intuition then tells us that the induced 4-dimensional planck scale should be @xmath398 let us now see this in the string theory language .",
    "note that the global tadpole cancellation guarantees that we have no _ tree - channel _ infra - red divergences . however , unless the twisted tadpoles are canceled locally , we do have tree - channel _ ultra - violet _ divergences ( which correspond to the loop - channel infra - red divergences ) .",
    "these divergences are logarithmic in the renormalization of the gauge couplings for massless d3-brane gauge bosons .",
    "that is , the loop - channel ultra - violet and infra - red divergences in the gauge coupling renormalization are _ not _ identical in this background .",
    "this is possible because , even though the massive string excitations still do not contribute into the corresponding amplitudes , the massive open string winding states do as they _ are _ bps states ( this effectively introduces the ultra - violet cut - off @xmath161 in the loop channel ) . in the tree channel",
    "this corresponds to non - vanishing contributions from massive kaluza - klein modes of twisted closed string states , which give rise to tree - channel ultra - violet divergences .    what about the graviton kinetic term on the d3-branes",
    "actually , the four - dimensional einstein - hilbert term receives contributions both from the open as well as _ closed _",
    "string diagrams with two external graviton lines .",
    "let us discuss this in more detail at the one - loop order .",
    "first consider the torus amplitude ( this is the genus-1 amplitude with no boundaries or cross - caps ) .",
    "massless as well as massive closed string states run in the loop .",
    "the untwisted closed string states renormalize the 10-dimensional part of the effective action .",
    "the twisted closed string states could _ a priori _ give rise to a _ six - dimensional _ einstein - hilbert term ( among other terms ) localized at the orbifold fixed point : @xmath399 however , the contribution to the 6-dimensional planck scale @xmath400 due to the twisted closed string states propagating in the closed string loop actually vanishes .",
    "this follows from the general result of @xcite , where it was shown that in type ii string theory on @xmath401 , where @xmath217 is some ( compact or non - compact ) ricci - flat manifold , the one - loop contribution to the four - dimensional planck scale is proportional to the euler characteristic of @xmath217 . in our case the latter vanishes , hence the above conclusion .",
    "this , in turn , can be related to the fact that before orientifolding in the closed string sector we have 16 supercharges .",
    "next , let us consider the klein bottle contribution to @xmath402 .",
    "let us first discuss contributions coming from the twisted closed string states running in the _ loop channel_. such contributions actually _",
    "vanish_. this is because only left - right symmetric states can contribute into the klein bottle , while the twisted closed string states are _ not _ left - right symmetric . in particular , note that the orientifold projection @xmath62 does not commute with the twist @xmath374 @xcite : @xmath403 this , in particular , implies that the twisted closed string ground states are not left - right symmetric , so the twisted closed string states do not contribute to the klein bottle amplitude .",
    "however , the untwisted closed string states running in the loop channel do contribute into @xmath402 @xcite .",
    "one way to see this is to go to the tree channel . in the tree channel",
    "these contributions correspond to both untwisted as well as twisted exchanges .",
    "the former only renormalize 10-dimensional terms .",
    "however , the latter give rise to a six - dimensional einstein - hilbert term ( among other terms ) .",
    "the corresponding contribution to the six - dimensional planck scale @xmath404 is of order @xmath405 .",
    "upon compactification on @xmath369 this translates into the following contribution to the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath406 : @xmath407 in particular , this is consistent with our field theory intuition .",
    "let us now discuss the open string one - loop amplitudes .",
    "an important point here is that we can attach the external graviton lines anywhere on the tube . in particular , there is nothing singular about attaching these lines to the boundaries or cross - caps .",
    "thus , if we do so , we do not change the chan - paton structure of the amplitude .",
    "in fact , the correct way of thinking about these amplitudes is that we consider all possible positions for the insertions , and then integrate over these positions .",
    "it is then clear that the untwisted annulus and mbius strip amplitudes ( that is , those with the untwisted chan - paton matrix @xmath27 acting on a boundary ) can only contribute to the renormalization of the 10-dimensional terms . on the other hand , the twisted annulus and mbius strip amplitudes ( that is , those with the twisted chan - paton matrix @xmath408 or @xmath409 acting on a boundary ) , can only contribute to the 6-dimensional planck scale , and",
    "this contribution is of order @xmath405 . in particular",
    ", there is no truly 4-dimensional einstein - hilbert term coming from these contributions .",
    "since the coordinates @xmath142 are compact , we once again obtain a contribution of order ( [ six ] ) .",
    "that is , the 4-dimensional planck scale is of order @xmath410 which is consistent with the field theory expectation ( [ fieldth ] ) .",
    "note that if we decompactify the torus ( @xmath411 ) , the 4-dimensional planck scale goes to _",
    "infinity_. the d3-brane field theory remains non - conformal in this case .",
    "this might appear to contradict our earlier claims that all non - compact @xmath13 models are conformal .",
    "actually , there is no contradiction here . indeed , even though we took the other three o3@xmath90-planes to infinity , they do _ not _ decouple as the twisted closed string states that couple them to the d3-branes propagate in _ two _ extra dimensions , and the massless 2-dimensional euclidean propagator is logarithmically divergent at large distances .",
    "since the tadpoles are not canceled locally in this background , the d3-brane theory becomes infinitely strongly coupled .",
    "one can see this from the effective field theory viewpoint by noting that , if we assume that the @xmath113 and @xmath412 gauge couplings are finite at any finite energy scale , the former blows up at some higher but finite scale ( landau pole ) once we take the cut - off @xmath161 to infinity ( which is what happens when we take @xmath210 to infinity ) .",
    "let us now go back to the case where we cancel all tadpoles locally .",
    "the low energy theory on each set of d3-branes is then conformal .",
    "note , however , that at finite @xmath210 we have a finite 4-dimensional planck scale .",
    "thus , we have a contribution from compactifying the 6-dimensional einstein - hilbert term , which comes from the closed string klein bottle amplitude as well as the open string annulus and mbius strip amplitudes , on @xmath369 . in particular , even though the d3-brane low energy effective field theories are conformal , the open string annulus and mbius strip amplitudes do contribute into the six - dimensional planck scale as we have a tower of massive open string excitations ( as the massive open string excitations do not contribute into the four - dimensional gauge coupling renormalization ) . ] .",
    "now we come to one of the key points of our discussion here - in the decompactification limit , even in the conformal case , the 4-dimensional planck scale is not zero but _",
    "infinite_. this is due to the fact that , in these backgrounds it actually comes from the compactification of the _ six - dimensional _ einstein - hilbert term localized at the orbifold fixed point . also , note that in the conformal case , once we decompactify the 2-torus , the o3@xmath90-planes and d3-branes at the other three fixed points decouple from those at the origin .",
    "and gravity now decouples not because the 4-dimensional planck scale goes to zero but because it goes to infinity .",
    "before we end this subsection , we would like to make the following remark . from the above discussion",
    "it might be tempting to consider a hybrid scenario with two extra dimensions ( untouched by the orbifold ) compactified on a large torus and four others non - compact .",
    "in particular , in this case we could take @xmath413 , and obtain the desired four - dimensional planck scale @xmath354 by choosing the size @xmath210 of the two compact extra dimensions to be of order of a millimeter as in @xcite .",
    "however , to obtain the desired cross - over scale @xmath350 , the brane thickness in this case would have to be extremely small .",
    "thus , let us focus on distance scales above the compactification size @xmath210 .",
    "then we can integrate out the compact extra dimensions , which leaves us with a model equivalent to having a 3-brane in 8-dimensional bulk .",
    "the 4-dimensional and 8-dimensional planck scales are given by @xmath414 following our discussion in subsection e of section iii , we then have the following relation between the cross - over scale @xmath350 and the brane thickness @xmath280 : @xmath415 to have @xmath350 around or above the present hubble size we must require that @xmath280 is around or smaller than @xmath416 , which would require a presence of a new ultra - high threshold @xmath364 in the theory .      from our discussion in the previous subsection",
    "it follows that , if we consider an oriented background of type iib on @xmath417 in the presence of d3-branes , we have a _ six - dimensional _ einstein - hilbert term localized at the orbifold fixed point .",
    "the gauge theory on the d3-branes in this case is the @xmath13 supersymmetric theory with the @xmath418 gauge group and matter hypermultiplets transforming in @xmath419 and @xmath420 .",
    "note that this theory is conformal .",
    "moreover , there is no ultra - violet cut - off in the d3-brane gauge theory .",
    "this is because the string excitations do not contribute into the gauge coupling renormalization as they are non - bps states ( and we have @xmath13 supersymmetry ) .",
    "that is , the ultra - violet cut - off @xmath161 in the theory is actually infinite , so the four - dimensional planck scale is also infinite .",
    "now we would like to deform this theory so that it is no longer conformal .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "note that the six - dimensional manifold @xmath217 transverse to the d3-branes is a ricci - flat manifold with the metric @xmath421 where @xmath209 is a metric on a compact 5-dimensional einstein manifold @xmath216 ( @xmath220 is a unit 5-sphere , @xmath422 ) , @xmath118 , and the action of the generator @xmath119 of @xmath19 on @xmath220 is given by @xmath423 note that the fixed point locus of @xmath119 in @xmath220 is a unit circle @xmath424 .",
    "we can deform the orbifold by blowing up this fixed circle .",
    "the resulting space @xmath425 is ricci - flat with the metric @xmath426 where @xmath427 is a metric on a compact 5-dimensional einstein manifold @xmath428 @xcite .",
    "the blow - up breaks supersymmetry from @xmath13 down to @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , in the low energy action it corresponds to adding a mass term to the adjoint chiral @xmath0 supermultiplet in the @xmath13 vector multiplet . this mass term is odd under the interchange of the two @xmath113 subgroups as the twisted closed string modes associated with the blow - up are odd under the @xmath19 twist .",
    "we therefore have for this mass term @xcite : @xmath429~,\\ ] ] where @xmath292 and @xmath295 are the aforementioned adjoint chiral @xmath0 supermultiplets corresponding to the first and the second @xmath113 subgroups , respectively .",
    "let us decompose the original matter hypermultiplets in terms of the @xmath0 chiral supermultiplets : @xmath430 in the original @xmath13 model we have the following superpotential ( in the @xmath0 language ) : @xmath431 +   g{\\rm tr}\\left[{\\widetilde \\phi}\\left(b_1a_1+b_2a_2\\right)\\right]~,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the yang - mills gauge coupling .",
    "integrating out the fields @xmath432 , we obtain the following effective superpotential @xmath433~,\\ ] ] which is non - renormalizable . in the infra - red the @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath418 gauge theory with chiral matter supermultiplets @xmath434 and @xmath102 flows into a superconformal field theory @xcite , which is what we expect from the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the above superpotential at the infra - red fixed point becomes a marginal deformation giving rise to a line of fixed points@xcite symmetry under the interchange of the two gauge groups , we then have a fixed surface , where the second marginal deformation corresponds to the difference between the kinetic energies of the two @xmath113 s @xcite . ] .    even though the above blown - up theory is conformal in the infra - red , it is not a conformal theory . in particular , we have a massive threshold @xmath435 in the theory .",
    "note that at the energy scales much higher than @xmath435 ( that is , in the ultra - violet ) the field theory once again becomes conformal - it is simply described by the original @xmath13 superconformal field theory . however , since the blown - up theory is not conformal , as was originally pointed out in @xcite , we expect the einstein - hilbert term to be generated on the d3-branes . here",
    "we would like to understand what the corresponding four - dimensional planck scale should be .    to begin with , note that the blown - up space @xmath425 is a _ conifold _",
    ", and the d3-branes are located at the conifold singularity . in particular , we no longer have an orbifold singularity .",
    "let the blow - up size be @xmath280 .",
    "then we have @xmath436 let us assume that @xmath437 .",
    "then we have @xmath438 , so that the massive adjoint chiral multiplets lie way below the string scale , and we should be able to trust the world - sheet expansion . the contribution of the low - energy field theory modes into the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath406 is then expected to be of order @xmath439 . this , however , is not the end of the story .",
    "the key point here is that we now have @xmath0 supersymmetry , so the massive string excitations do contribute into the gauge coupling renormalization .",
    "note , however , that each massive level is expected to give a threshold contribution of order @xmath440 indeed , in the limit @xmath441 these threshold contributions should vanish as in this limit the @xmath13 supersymmetry is restored .",
    "this , in particular , implies that the gauge theory cut - off @xmath161 is _ not _ of order @xmath359 ( the lowest string excitation ) , but _",
    "higher_. in fact , we can estimate this cut - off as follows .",
    "we expect the ultra - violet cut - off in the gauge theory to be of order of the energy scale such that the combined contribution of the massive string thresholds lying below this scale becomes of order 1 .",
    "let @xmath442 be the corresponding string level .",
    "then we have : @xmath443 that is , @xmath444 .",
    "the ultra - violet cut - off is then given by : @xmath445 thus , the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath446 note that this is consistent with our expectation that in the conformal limit @xmath447 we must have @xmath448 .",
    "we can understand this result intuitively in the following way . in the conformal case ( that is , before blowing up the orbifold ) the annulus and mbius strip amplitudes actually give finite contributions to the 10-dimensional and 6-dimensional planck scales depending on whether a given amplitude is untwisted or twisted .",
    "but there is no truly four - dimensional einstein - hilbert term .",
    "if , as in the previous subsection , we compactify the two extra dimensions untouched by the orbifold , then we have a finite four - dimensional planck scale which goes to infinity in the decompactification limit .",
    "let us now discuss what happens once we blow up the orbifold ( in the case where all six extra dimensions are non - compact ) . note that the transverse space @xmath425 is smooth everywhere except for the conifold singularity ( where the d3-branes are located ) .",
    "attaching the external graviton lines to boundaries in , say , the annulus amplitude now _ is _ special as this amounts to attaching these lines at the conifold singularity .",
    "in particular , if the locations of the external insertions are away from the conifold singularity , such diagrams only renormalize the bulk operators . on the other hand , if the locations of the external insertions coincide with the conifold singularity , the corresponding diagrams renormalize the 4-dimensional planck scale ( among other terms ) .",
    "let us now understand the size of the cut - off @xmath161 . recall that in the orbifold background the infra - red and ultra - violet divergence structures are identical .",
    "the blow - up modifies the background , but since the blow - up size @xmath280 is small , at the leading order the relation between the infra - red and ultra - violet effects remains intact .",
    "thus , let us consider the loop - channel infra - red physics .",
    "the blow - up introduces the infra - red scale @xmath435 in the loop channel .",
    "this translates into an ultra - violet scale @xmath364 in the tree channel .",
    "in particular , in the tree channel the ultra - violet effects become soft around this scale .",
    "in the tree channel this scale arises due to the closed string kaluza - klein modes associated with the blow - up .",
    "since the tree - channel ultra - violet effects become soft around the scale @xmath364 , the brane thickness is expected to be of oder @xmath280 ( recall that , if the brane matter is non - conformal , the brane thickness is expected to be non - vanishing so that the divergences discussed in section iii are smoothed out ) .",
    "similarly , in the tree channel we have an _ infra - red _ cut - off scale @xmath435 , which arises due to the fact that some of the twisted closed string states that are massless in the orbifold limit are now _ massive _ with masses of order @xmath435 . in the loop channel",
    "this translates into the _ ultra - violet _ scale @xmath449 .",
    "in particular , this implies that we have a massive _ open _ string threshold associated with this scale ( which decouples in the orbifold limit ) .",
    "this open string threshold is due to the fact that now the brane thickness is non - vanishing , so that we have a massive _ breathing _",
    "mode with mass of order @xmath364 .",
    "thus , as we see , the four - dimensional planck scale in this example is controlled by the size of the blow - up .",
    "the reason why this is possible is that the blow up we are considering here is not a marginal deformation of the orbifold singularity in @xmath450 but a _ relevant _ one .",
    "note that above we considered an oriented type iib background .",
    "however , we can generalize our discussion to the orientifold of type iib on @xmath450 .",
    "note that in this case we also have an o7-plane and 8 of the corresponding d7-branes .",
    "we will come back to unoriented conifold backgrounds in section vi , where we discuss some phenomenological applications of the orientiworld models .",
    "before we end this subsection , let us make the following remark . to obtain the desired four - dimensional planck scale @xmath451",
    ", we must choose @xmath452 .",
    "then , as we discussed in subsection e of section iii , we must take @xmath413 - in this case the cross - over scale @xmath453 ( the present hubble size ) , while for larger @xmath359 @xmath350 is smaller ( and smaller @xmath359 are phenomenologically disfavored ) .",
    "the infra - red scale @xmath435 is then of order @xmath454 ( about an inverse millimeter ) .",
    "here it is difficult to judge whether this is a worrisome feature or a bonus - the model at hand is not realistic , so we will have to postpone discussing this point until we have a more realistic looking model .",
    "it is clear that in the @xmath0 orientiworld models with @xmath52 the situation is similar to that in the @xmath13 theories discussed in the previous subsections .",
    "let us therefore focus on the cases with @xmath11 but @xmath54 .",
    "as we discussed in subsection d of section ii , the d3-brane gauge theories in these models are always chiral and non - conformal .",
    "let us therefore understand the origin of the four - dimensional planck scale in these models .",
    "first , let us focus on the cases where all twists @xmath166 have fixed point loci of real dimension 0 ( that is , @xmath26 does not have a non - trivial subgroup which is also a subgroup of @xmath455 , so @xmath372 , where @xmath101 is odd ) .",
    "let us start with the closed string torus amplitude .",
    "the untwisted closed string states running in the loop renormalize 10-dimensional terms .",
    "however , the _ twisted _ closed string states give rise to a _ four - dimensional _ einstein - hilbert term ( among other terms ) localized at the orbifold fixed point : @xmath456 the corresponding contribution to the 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath457 . as in the previous subsection",
    ", the klein bottle amplitude also gives a contribution of the same order of magnitude into @xmath458 .",
    "this contribution is due to the untwisted closed string states running in the loop channel , while the twisted closed string states in the loop channel do not contribute ( @xmath459 ) .",
    "next , consider the one - loop open string amplitudes .",
    "the untwisted annulus and mbius strip amplitudes renormalize the bulk terms .",
    "however , the _ twisted _ annulus and mbius strip amplitudes now contribute to the renormalization of the four - dimensional einstein - hilbert term ( as well as other terms ) .",
    "the corresponding contributions to the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath458 are of order @xmath460 .",
    "this is evident in the tree channel , while in the loop channel this can be understood from the fact that the massive open string excitations in @xmath0 backgrounds do contribute into the renormalization of the d3-brane gauge couplings , so that the ultra - violet cut - off @xmath161 in the d3-brane gauge theory is of order @xmath359 .",
    "here we come to an important point .",
    "the d3-brane gauge theory is non - conformal . at the orbifold point",
    "we have no ultra - violet divergences in the open string loop channel ( that is , we have no infra - red divergences in the tree channel ) as all twisted tadpoles are canceled . however , we do have infra - red divergences in the loop channel , which translate into ultra - violet divergences in the tree channel .",
    "in fact , as we discussed in section iii , since the d3-brane gauge theory is non - conformal , and since the d3-branes are @xmath3-function - like , we expect ultra - violet divergences to arise in the coupling between gravity and brane matter at the tree level . on the other hand",
    ", we also expect these divergences to be smoothed out . as we will now argue , blowing up the orbifold smoothes out these divergences .",
    "before we proceed further , let us discuss one important point concerning blowing up such orbifold singularities .",
    "for definiteness , here we will focus on a simple example , but our conclusions also apply to the general class of models we are discussing here .",
    "thus , consider the @xmath461 orbifold , where @xmath462 , and the generator @xmath374 of @xmath463 acts as follows on the complex coordinates @xmath464 , @xmath465 , on @xmath67 : @xmath466 where @xmath467 .",
    "we have a usual marginal blow - up in this orbifold .",
    "however , we do not have the analog of the relevant blow - up discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "thus , we can view the above @xmath468 orbifold as follows .",
    "the metric on @xmath217 is given by @xmath421 where @xmath209 is a metric on a compact 5-dimensional einstein manifold @xmath469 .",
    "the generator @xmath374 of @xmath463 has the same action on the coordinates @xmath464 on @xmath220 , @xmath422 , as in ( [ z - orb ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath374 does _ not _ have a fixed point set on @xmath219 , that is , the manifold @xmath219 is _",
    "smooth_. this is simply another way of stating the fact that the orbifold singularity in @xmath217 is the same as the conifold singularity in @xmath217 , so blowing up the orbifold singularity is equivalent to smoothing out the conifold . and",
    "the corresponding blow - up is marginal .",
    "the fact that the orbifold blow - up is marginal in this case implies that the blow - up does _ not _ introduce an infra - red cut - off in the tree channel , that is , there is no new ultra - violet threshold in the loop channel associated with the blow - up . in particular , the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath470 remains of order @xmath359 even if we consider such a marginal blow - up .",
    "here we are assuming that the blow - up size , call it @xmath471 , is small : @xmath472 , so we can still trust the world - sheet expansion .",
    "note that ( unlike in the @xmath13 cases discussed above ) here the infra - red and ultra - violet divergence structures are _",
    "different_. this _ a priori _ allows to have an ultra - violet cut - off in the tree channel without having an infra - red cut - off in the tree channel .",
    "in particular , the blow - up provides such an ultra - violet cut - off in the tree channel - in the closed string sector we have a heavy kaluza - klein threshold of order @xmath473 associated with the blow - up ( according to our expectations in section iii , the brane thickness is then of order @xmath471 ) . in the loop channel",
    "this is expected to translate into an infra - red cut - off of order @xmath474 that is , after the blow - up we must have light open string states with masses of order @xmath72 .",
    "and we do .",
    "indeed , in the gauge theory blowing up the orbifold corresponds to higgsing along the f- and d - flat directions orientifold model , which we review in the next section , the f- and d - flat directions were discussed in detail in @xcite . ]",
    "( this is because the blow - up is marginal ) , that is , to an appropriate deformation of the gauge bundle .",
    "the massive open string states resulting from this higgsing then have masses of order @xmath72 .",
    "note that in the above scenario we have @xmath475 , so both should be of order @xmath476 .",
    "then , to have the cross - over scale not smaller than the present hubble size , the blow - up size should be extremely small , not larger than @xmath416 .",
    "then the scale @xmath72 is smaller than or of order @xmath454 ( about an inverse millimeter ) .      in the previous subsection we focused on the simple case where all twists in @xmath26 have fixed point loci of real dimension 0 . in a more general class of models",
    "we can also have twists with fixed point loci of real dimension 2 .",
    "we would like to discuss this class of models next .",
    "in fact , as we will argue in the following , this class of models appears to be most suitable for the phenomenological goals we have been pursuing .",
    "thus , consider the orbifold group @xmath11 but @xmath171 such that some twists in @xmath26 have fixed point loci of real dimension 2 .",
    "this then implies that there exists a non - trivial subgroup of @xmath26 , call it @xmath477 , such that @xmath478 ( in particular , @xmath477 could be a subgroup of @xmath12 ) .",
    "the elements of @xmath26 that do not belong to @xmath477 need not commute with the elements of @xmath477 .",
    "however , for our purposes here it will suffice to assume that they do ( our conclusions , however , will be applicable in the general case ) . in this case",
    "@xmath479 , where @xmath101 is odd , @xmath480 but @xmath481 ( it then also follows that @xmath482 ) . let the generator of @xmath100 be @xmath374 , while @xmath483 . then @xmath484 .",
    "note that in this case we can view the orientifold of type iib on @xmath485 as the @xmath100 orbifold of the orientifold of type iib on @xmath486 .",
    "let us first discuss gravity in such a model before any blow - ups .",
    "the @xmath487 ( @xmath43 ) twisted sectors give rise to various 6-dimensional einstein - hilbert terms localized on the corresponding fixed points .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath488 , then these twisted sectors give rise to only one type of the 6-dimensional einstein - hilbert term , while if @xmath489 , then we have more then one types of 6-dimensional einstein - hilbert terms ( with the extra two dimensions identified with the corresponding fixed point loci )",
    ". the @xmath490 , @xmath491 , twisted sectors can also give rise to 6-dimensional einstein - hilbert terms , but need not depending upon a particular orbifold group .",
    "if they do not , then they give rise to a 4-dimensional einstein - hilbert term .",
    "finally , the @xmath492 , @xmath493 , twisted sectors contribute to the 4-dimensional einstein - hilbert term .",
    "the important point here is that we always have at least one type of a 6-dimensional einstein - hilbert term present in such backgrounds .",
    "note that the 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath475 , and the 6-dimensional planck scale @xmath400 .",
    "suppose we blow up the fixed point at the origin of @xmath485 , which is associated with the @xmath100 orbifold .",
    "the brane thickness is then of order of the corresponding marginal blow - up size @xmath471 .",
    "since we have 6-dimensional einstein - hilbert terms , before we discuss the cross - over to the 10-dimensional gravity , we must discuss a possible cross - over to the 6-dimensional gravity .",
    "however , since we do not have a tree - level infra - red cut - off in these backgrounds , following our discussion in subsection 2 of appendix c , we conclude that we do not have a cross - over to the 6-dimensional gravity .",
    "the cross - over to the 10-dimensional gravity then goes as in the previous subsection .",
    "in particular , we must have an extremely small @xmath471 in this case .",
    "the above scenario , however , is not the only possible one . in particular",
    ", we can utilize the fact that , as we discussed in subsection b , in some cases we have relevant blow - ups of the orbifold singularities associated with the twists @xmath487 .",
    "for illustrative purposes let us consider a simple example here .",
    "thus , let @xmath494 , and let @xmath495 , where the generators @xmath374 and @xmath119 of @xmath463 respectively @xmath19 have the following action on the complex coordinates @xmath464 on @xmath67 : @xmath496 the metric on @xmath461 is given by : @xmath421 where @xmath209 is a metric on a compact 5-dimensional einstein manifold @xmath216 . the generators @xmath374 and @xmath119 have the same action on the coordinates @xmath464 on @xmath220 , @xmath422 , as above .",
    "the fixed point locus of the twist @xmath119 in @xmath220 is a unit circle @xmath424 : @xmath497 .",
    "the action of the twist @xmath374 on this fixed circle is given by @xmath498 , so the @xmath463 orbifold simply reduces the size of this circle by a factor of 3 .",
    "we can therefore consider a relevant blow - up of this circle as in subsection b. after this blow - up , whose size we will denote via @xmath280 , we no longer have a 6-dimensional einstein - hilbert term . rather ,",
    "both the @xmath499 and the blown - up @xmath19 orbifolds contribute into the 4-dimensional planck scale .",
    "these contributions , however , are very different .",
    "thus , from our previous discussions it should be clear that at the one - loop order the contributions of the @xmath463 ( as well as @xmath500 ) twisted sectors into the 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath406 are of order @xmath460",
    ". however the contributions from the blown - up @xmath19 orbifold are of order @xmath501 , so assuming that @xmath502 , we have the following estimate for the 4-dimensional planck scale : @xmath503 let us also blow up the @xmath463 singularities ( this blow - up is marginal ) .",
    "we will choose the corresponding blow - up size @xmath504 .",
    "it is then clear that the brane thickness is of order @xmath280 .",
    "now we can take @xmath505 and obtain the cross - over scale ( to the 10-dimensional gravity ) of order of the present hubble size .",
    "the infra - red scales @xmath506 in this case are both about an inverse millimeter .",
    "thus , as we see , in this case the situation is similar to that discussed in the @xmath13 models in subsection b except that here the d3-brane gauge theories are non - conformal even in the orbifold limit .",
    "that is , one might hope to construct various realistic looking non - conformal chiral @xmath507 models in this context .",
    "we will discuss such models in section vi .",
    "before we end this subsection , the following remark is in order .",
    "since we are discussing @xmath0 models , we expect that the d3-brane gauge theory cut - off @xmath161 is or order @xmath359 .",
    "it might then appear surprising that @xmath508 .",
    "however , the key point here is that there are actually _ two _ ultra - violet cut - offs in such backgrounds .",
    "one is @xmath509 , and another one is @xmath510 .",
    "in particular , if we view the low energy modes as parts of @xmath13 multiplets corresponding to the @xmath511 model , we expect that the massive string thresholds will contribute to the gauge coupling renormalization up to the scale @xmath512 .",
    "however , the fact that we do not have complete @xmath13 multiplets implies that it makes no sense to talk about the gauge coupling renormalization beyond the scale @xmath161 , which is determined by the truly @xmath0 supersymmetric massive string excitations that contribute to the gauge coupling renormalization starting at the lowest such excitation . in other words ,",
    "the gauge theory cut - off is given by @xmath161 as we have a tower of massive open string states starting at around @xmath359 , while the four - dimensional gravitational cut - off is given by @xmath512 , and gravity is weak all the way up to @xmath186 .",
    "this is in some sense analogous to what happens in little string theories @xcite .",
    "before we end this section , as an aside we would like to discuss a somewhat different scenario , where 4 of the extra dimensions are compact , but we have 2 non - compact extra dimensions",
    ". for illustrative purposes let us focus on the orbifold group @xmath513 discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "thus , consider the case where the transverse space is given by @xmath514  , where @xmath515 is ( an orbifold limit of ) a k3 surface , and the complex coordinates @xmath516 and @xmath375 now parametrize @xmath517 respectively @xmath518 .",
    "since we have only two non - compact directions in @xmath217 , the number of d3-branes is now fixed by the untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions to be 8 .",
    "this is because we have 16 o3-planes located at the corresponding fixed points on @xmath519 .",
    "we also have an o7-plane and 8 of the corresponding d7-branes . here",
    "we should point out that the corresponding @xmath513 model is not realistic as the gauge group only contains @xmath12 factors ( see subsection e of section v ) , so we do not have the @xmath520 subgroup of the standard model .",
    "however , here we would like to use this model to discuss a point _ a priori _ unrelated to how realistic this model is from the particle physics viewpoint .    thus , suppose the linear sizes of the k3 surface are all of order @xmath521 . at low energies we can integrate out the k3 part and obtain a model which is equivalent to having a 3-brane in 6-dimensional bulk with infinite volume extra - dimensions .",
    "since we have no tree - level infra - red divergences in this model ( all tadpoles are canceled ) , following our discussion in the previous subsection , we could consider a model with no cross - over from the 4-dimensional gravity to 6-dimensional gravity .",
    "here we should point out that the number of such `` hybrid '' models would be quite limited for the reasons mentioned in introduction .",
    "in this section we would like to discuss explicit examples of orientiworld models . as we have already mentioned in introduction ,",
    "the number of such models is infinitely large , and we have a large number of potentially interesting models to explore . here",
    "we will not attempt to perform an exhaustive search for phenomenologically most interesting models .",
    "rather , we will discuss some examples to get a flavor of what kind of features we can expect from the orientiworld construction ( we will discuss phenomenological applications in the next section ) . here",
    "we will focus on examples with the orbifold group @xmath11 but @xmath522 .",
    "such examples have been studied in @xcite . for illustrative purposes here",

    "the field @xmath670 gives rise to the electroweak higgs doublets .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from the superpotential ( [ suphiggs ] ) , the third generation ( that is , the top quark generation ) is identified with @xmath652 and @xmath671 .",
    "the extra triplets @xmath672 should acquire soft masses upon supersymmetry breaking ( these masses are presumably of order @xmath413 ) . here",
    "we note that , upon integrating out these states , it might be possible to generate higher dimensional operators responsible for giving masses to the other two chiral generations .",
    "potentially dangerous states are the anti - symmetric states @xmath550 .",
    "they too could acquire masses upon supersymmetry breaking .",
    "however , it needs to be checked whether there are no dangerous baryon number violating couplings due to these states .",
    "this is , however , outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "thus , as we see , in the orientiworld context we have constructed a truly 3-family pati - salam model with the correct higgs content .",
    "in fact , we even have the correct couplings in the superpotential for one generation to be much heavier then the other two .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this model is the closest to the minimal supersymmetric standard model constructed via the orientifold construction .",
    "before we end this section , let us make the following remark .",
    "here we discussed this model at the orbifold point . to obtain four - dimensional gravity , as we discussed in section iv ,",
    "we need to consider relevant blow - ups of the @xmath19 twists , that is , we need to consider the corresponding conifold background . in the process of blowing up these twists ,",
    "some of the massless states acquire non - zero masses .",
    "however , these masses are about @xmath454 , so the above discussion is not expected to be modified substantially . it would be interesting to understand whether this scale @xmath454 has anything to do with the neutrino masses ( note that in the pati - salam model we have right - handed neutrinos ) .",
    "in the orientiworld framework we discussed in this paper the standard model gauge and matter fields are localized on ( a collection of ) d3-branes embedded in infinite - volume extra space .",
    "this transverse space can be an orbifold or a more general conifold .",
    "the four - dimensional gravity on d3-branes is reproduced due to a four - dimensional einstein - hilbert term induced at the quantum level .",
    "in particular , gravity can be four - dimensional up to the cross - over distance scale @xmath350 , which can be as large as the present hubble size .",
    "not surprisingly , this requires a hierarchy of scales .",
    "here we would like to comment on this hierarchy .    for definiteness",
    "let us focus on the scenario we discussed in subsection d of section iv . in this scenario , where the transverse space is a conifold obtained by relevant blow - ups of certain orbifold singularities , the string scale @xmath359 is of order tev , while the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath673 , where @xmath280 is the size of these blow - ups .",
    "the aforementioned hierarchy then is in having two very different distance scales , namely , the string length @xmath521 and the blow - up size @xmath280 .",
    "one possibility is that the size of the blow - up is determined dynamically upon supersymmetry breaking .",
    "so we must understand supersymmetry breaking in the orientiworld framework .",
    "one possibility for obtaining non - supersymmetric orientiworld models is to start from @xmath0 supersymmetric models , and break supersymmetry dynamically .",
    "this would require constructing orientiworld models with certain additional sectors that would dynamically break supersymmetry and then mediate it to the standard model sector .",
    "alternatively , especially in scenarios with @xmath359 of order tev , we could consider constructing orientiworld backgrounds that are non - supersymmetric already at the tree level .",
    "such models were originally discussed in @xcite ( for subsequent developments see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one can construct anomaly - free chiral models where all tadpoles are canceled .",
    "in particular , these models contain anti - d3-branes ( or anti - o3-planes ) .",
    "however , in all of such models we have _ twisted _ closed string tachyons .",
    "let us point out that in the models of @xcite all divergences due to the closed string tachyons coupling to the d - branes and orientifold planes are canceled just as all the massless tadpoles .",
    "so the presence of the closed string tachyons does not destabilize the gauge theories on d3-branes . as to the bulk",
    ", there is a possibility that , once all the tachyons condense , we obtain a supersymmetric closed string background @xcite .",
    "if so , this would mean that we could construct orientiworld models where the bulk is supersymmetric , while the brane supersymmetry is broken at the tree level .",
    "in other words , the branes would be non - bps , and would break all supersymmetries .",
    "such orientiworld models could also be interesting for the cosmological constant problem .",
    "in particular , if the bulk supersymmetry is intact , one might hope that it might protect the brane cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "thus , if we consider a codimension-2 or higher brane in infinite - volume extra space , we have flat brane solutions for a continuous range of the brane tension ( that is , unlike in the codimension-1 case , positive brane tension does not necessarily imply inflation on the brane ) .",
    "this by itself , however , is not sufficient to successfully address the cosmological constant problem . indeed , even in higher codimension cases we do have solutions with inflation on the brane .",
    "the idea then is the following @xcite .",
    "suppose the bulk is supersymmetric , and we break brane supersymmetry . since the volume of the extra space is infinite , the bulk supersymmetry is , nonetheless , intact .",
    "now , the cosmological constant is an infra - red quantity - it is measured at large distances . in the scenarios we discussed above",
    ", gravity becomes higher dimensional around the hubble size , so , at least naively , we would then be measuring the higher - dimensional cosmological constant ( and not the four - dimensional one ) , which vanishes due to the unbroken bulk supersymmetry .",
    "it would be interesting to test this idea in higher codimension models .",
    "another point we would like to comment on here is gauge coupling unification .",
    "thus , in the scenario where @xmath359 is of order tev we might expect that the extrapolated unification of gauge couplings in the mssm would have to be an accident . here",
    "we would like to point out that this might not necessarily be the case .",
    "first , one might consider a scenario where the standard model fields live on d4- or d5-branes with the corresponding compactification sizes along the branes of order of @xmath521 .",
    "then we could have accelerated unification as in @xcite .",
    "however , _ a priori _ there is another possibility here , which need _ not _ involve compactification .",
    "the general idea was originally discussed in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) , and here we would like to tailor it for the orientiworld context . as we have already mentioned , in the scenario discussed in subsection d of section iv we have two different cut - offs on d3-branes , namely , @xmath509 and @xmath674 . the key reason why this is possible",
    "is that we have _ two _ extra dimensions transverse to the d3-branes that are untouched by @xmath13 supersymmetric orbifold twists .",
    "if these dimensions were compact , then we could have large logarithmic threshold corrections due to the corresponding open string windings @xcite .",
    "the compactification in this case plays the role of an ultra - violet cut - off . in the orientiworld context",
    ", once we deform to a conifold , we effectively have such a cut - off , namely , @xmath512 , even without compactification . then one might hope that we could achieve unification along the lines of @xcite by having the dilaton and/or the relevant twisted field vacuum expectation values varying from point to point in the bulk ( in some cases such backgrounds could be studied in the f - theory @xcite language @xcite ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see if this idea can be made more concrete .",
    "finally , let us mention that various issues such as proton stability , flavor violation as well as neutrino masses might need to be addressed in the orientiworld context with @xmath359 of order tev .",
    "it is important to note that gravity in such scenarios is weak .",
    "nonetheless , one might have to worry about the open string excitations in this context .",
    "some of the ideas discussed in the context of @xcite might be applicable in the orientiworld context as well .",
    "in particular , proton stabilization @xcite , neutrino masses @xcite and flavor violation @xcite can be addressed in theories with @xmath359 of order tev .",

    "in this appendix we give the calculation of the tree - level exchange of a twisted 2-form in the cylinder amplitude that leads to renormalization of the @xmath51 gauge couplings in orientiworld models .",
    "more precisely , as we already mentioned in subsection c of section ii , for our purposes here it suffices to discuss this calculation in the oriented type iib setup .",
    "in fact , for simplicity we will focus on the @xmath19 model discussed in subsection c of section ii .",
    "the relevant action reads ( see subsection c of section ii for details ) : @xmath675 what we need to compute is the exchange of the 2-form @xmath129 between two boundaries with a @xmath128 gauge boson attached to each boundary . to do this",
    ", we can simply compute the @xmath129 field created by a @xmath128 background field , and then couple it back to this background field .",

    "loop channel_. we then have : @xmath685 the self - interaction term is given by : @xmath686 this results in the renormalization of the @xmath128 gauge coupling . the renormalized kinetic term for the @xmath128 gauge field",
    "is now given by : @xmath687 where @xmath688 for @xmath689 this reproduces the usual logarithmic @xmath128 gauge coupling running ( in fact , it is not difficult to check that with the normalization for the bare @xmath128 gauge coupling @xmath152 we have adopted , we have the correct one - loop @xmath169-function coefficient ) . in this case",
    "we have a logarithmic divergence , which must be regularized by introducing the tree - channel ultra - violet cut - off @xmath684 .",
    "we also have a logarithmic tree - channel infra - red divergence at @xmath690 , which translates into the corresponding loop - channel ultra - violet divergence",
    ".    however , for non - vanishing @xmath150 the gauge coupling does _ not _ run .",
    "in fact , we only have a _",
    "finite non - local _ correction even if we take @xmath691 limit ( that is , if we remove the tree - channel ultra - violet cut - off ) : @xmath692~.\\ ] ] here it is important to note that we do _ not _ have a tree - channel infra - red divergence either . in particular , the integral over @xmath250 in ( [ renorm ] ) is cut off in the infra - red at @xmath693 , where @xmath694 is the mass of the @xmath128 gauge boson .",
    "that is , we do not have a loop - channel ultra - violet divergence either .",
    "thus , as we see , once we introduce the kinetic term for the @xmath129 field on the d3-branes , we have no ultra - violet or infra - red divergences in the @xmath128 coupling .",
    "as we argued in subsection c of section ii , such a kinetic term would be generated at the one - loop level with @xmath695 where @xmath30 is a dimensionless numerical coefficient , and @xmath161 is the loop - channel ultra - violet cut - off .",
    "we then interpret the above result as the @xmath128 symmetry being _ global _ and not local .",
    "in fact , here we would like to argue that this is consistent with the case where the two extra dimensions @xmath142 are compactified on a large 2-torus .",
    "thus , consider a model where we compactify @xmath142 on a square 2-torus @xmath369 : @xmath696 then in the absence of wilson lines on @xmath369 we actually have the same four - dimensional spectrum .",
    "let us assume that @xmath371 .",
    "then we actually have a _ tree - level _",
    "4-dimensional kinetic term ( [ kinetic ] ) for the @xmath129 field with @xmath697 thus , the @xmath128 gauge field is massive . in fact",
    ", we can now see why ( [ l ] ) should be the case .",
    "note that in the d3-brane language we have _ winding _ open string modes with masses : @xmath698 where @xmath699 , and @xmath700 .",
    "this can also be seen by t - dualizing along the @xmath369 .",
    "the d3-branes then go into d5-branes , and the 2-torus @xmath369 goes into a dual 2-torus @xmath701 with the coordinates @xmath702 where @xmath703 note that @xmath704 .",
    "now we have kaluza - klein modes with masses @xmath705 where @xmath706 , and @xmath707 .",
    "these kaluza - klein modes in the d5-brane language correspond to the winding modes in the d3-brane language .",
    "note that the theory on the d5-branes is a 4-dimensional gauge theory at the momenta @xmath708 ( that is , below the kaluza - klein threshold ) . even though the string excitations lie way below the kaluza - klein threshold , they do not contribute to the gauge coupling renormalization as we discussed in subsection c of section ii .",
    "this implies that the 4-dimensional gauge theory cut - off is given by the kaluza - klein threshold @xcite ( that is , compactification on @xmath369 effectively introduces an ultra - violet cut - off into the d3-brane gauge theory ) : @xmath709 where a dimensionless numerical coefficient @xmath710 parametrizes the subtraction scheme dependence .",
    "this confirms our intuition that we should have ( [ l ] ) .",
    "note that at the momenta @xmath711 the d5-brane theory becomes 6-dimensional . in this 6-dimensional theory ( which can be thought about in the language of a model where we place non - compact d5-branes at the @xmath19 orbifold singularity )",
    "the @xmath128 gauge symmetry is anomalous ( note that in six dimensions @xmath51 anomalies come from box diagrams ) .",
    "it is broken by a chern - simons mixing with the twisted 4-form , call it @xmath712 : @xmath713 note that this twisted 4-form propagates in six dimensions along the d5-brane world - volume .",
    "its exchange in the cylinder amplitude with a @xmath128 gauge boson attached to each boundary gives rise to a quadratic divergence .",
    "however , this quadratic divergence is removed once @xmath128 acquires mass , which breaks the @xmath128 gauge symmetry to a global one .",
    "in this appendix we would like to discuss the case where we smooth out the brane completely , that is , when we replace the @xmath178-dimensional @xmath3-function @xmath270 by a smooth distribution @xmath269 .",
    "in fact , for our purposes here it will suffice to study the simple distribution @xmath281 given by ( [ dist1 ] ) .",
    "in the main text we studied the @xmath297 case in detail . however , we can equally easily determine the graviton propagator on the brane in general @xmath178 . because of the logarithmic property of the 2-dimensional propagator , the @xmath266 case requires a separate treatment , while the @xmath207 cases can be discussed together . in this appendix",
    "we provide the corresponding details .      for the reader s convenience , here we repeat the relevant equations : @xmath291~,\\\\   & & h=-{{d-2}\\over d}\\chi=-{{d-2}\\over{d-2}}m_p^{2-d}t(p){\\widetilde \\phi}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath292 , @xmath188 and @xmath293 are the solutions to the following equations @xmath727f(r)~,\\\\   & & \\left (   \\partial^i\\partial_i - p^2\\right)\\sigma=   \\left[{\\widetilde \\phi}+l^dp^2\\sigma\\right ] f(r)~,\\\\   & & \\left (   \\partial^i\\partial_i - p^2\\right){\\widetilde \\phi}=   \\left[1-\\kappa l^d p^2{\\widetilde \\phi}\\right]f(r)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subject to the condition that @xmath292 , @xmath188 and @xmath295 decay to zero away from the brane ( here we are focusing on the cases @xmath207 , where this is true even for the @xmath257 modes ) . as before , we are using the notation @xmath296 to simplify expressions containing @xmath293 .",

    "note , however , that in this case @xmath310 is only logarithmically small compared with @xmath747 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we take @xmath748 , then @xmath749 , and there is no cross - over between the @xmath224-dimensional gravity and the @xmath180-dimensional gravity ( that is , gravity on the brane is always @xmath224-dimensional ) .",
    "note that @xmath119 is a tree - level infra - red cut - off .",
    "we can then take the @xmath748 limit in the cases where such a cut - off is absent .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the case of a codimension-2 brane with positive tension . in @xmath266 the equations of motion for the warp factors @xmath333 and @xmath334 discussed in subsection d of section iii simplify as follows : @xmath750+b^{\\prime\\prime}+{1\\over r}b^\\prime+{1\\over 2}{\\widehat\\tau }   f(r)=0~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is then not difficult to see that for non - zero @xmath751 the only solution is given by @xmath338 ( more precisely , @xmath333 should be constant , which we can set to zero ) , and @xmath752 the smooth solution to this equation is given by ( we have set the integration constant so that @xmath334 vanishes on the brane ) : @xmath753 where @xmath754 note that the space is locally flat , but for @xmath755 we have a deficit angle equal @xmath756 we will therefore assume that @xmath757 .    in this background we can also solve the linearized equations of motion for the graviton and the graviscalars @xcite .",
