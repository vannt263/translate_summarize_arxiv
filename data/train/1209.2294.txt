    "a noise is often considered as a nuisance for a system to display any ordered behavior , and thus the weaker the better for the performance of the system . however , for the last decades , a lot of researchers have revealed that this is not always the case and that there exist a class of systems in which the intermediate strength of noise can help the system to show the best coherence with an external periodic driving .",
    "this surprising phenomenon was termed as the stochastic resonance ( sr ) due to its stochastic nature  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of sr has been found in the fields of physics and earth science , as well as in biology : the periodically recurrent ice ages , the bistable ring laser , superconducting quantum interference device , human vision and th3 auditory system , and the feeding mechanism of paddle fish , to list a few  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of the sr is properly explained by the time - scale matching condition : the coherence between the system s response and the external driving becomes strongest when the stochastic time scale inherent in the system matches the time scale provided by the external driving . in a simple classical system of a few degrees of freedom making contact with a thermal reservoir ,",
    "the intrinsic time scale is given by the monotonically decreasing function of the exponential thermal activation form .",
    "accordingly , the above mentioned time - scale matching condition can only be satisfied at a single temperature  @xcite .",
    "the time - scale matching condition was later extended to the classical statistical mechanical systems with continuous phase transitions such as the globally coupled , i.e. , infinite - range kinetic ising model  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the nonmonotonic behavior of the intrinsic time scale around the critical temperature makes the time - scale matching condition satisfied at two distinct temperatures , one below and the other above the critical temperature , resulting in the double resonance peaks .",
    "the double sr peaks have also been observed in the classical heisenberg spin system in a planar thin film geometry  @xcite , and infinite - range @xmath2-state clock model  @xcite .    , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnetization .",
