    "holographic duality , best known in the context of ads / cft correspondence @xcite , states that any gravity theory in a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime with asymptotical anti - de sitter geometry has a dual description of quantum field theory living at its @xmath1-dimensional boundary .",
    "one advantage of this duality is that several observables at the strongly coupled limit in the field theory side can be computed in the gravity side at the large radius of curvature limit , even though the knowledge of underlying microscopic degrees of freedom may still be missing . in the past",
    ", several holographic gravity models have been proposed to capture behaviors of ( non-)fermi liquid on the boundary condensed matter system @xcite . among them , a charged dilatonic black hole proposed by gubser and rocha @xcite is particularly attractive for two features : at first , different from other bottom - up approaches , this background can be seen as the dimensional reduction from the near - horizon geometry of three - equal - charge black hole in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "secondly , it was claimed that in the infrared this model is dual to a fermi liquid thanks to its linear relation between entropy and temperature .",
    "normal modes of a probed fermion were studied in the extremal limit of charged black hole @xcite and linear dispersion relation was verified in @xcite .    on the other hand , a boundary theory dual to the ads reissner - nordstrm black hole in the presence of a dipole interaction term is proposed @xcite and studied in several following works @xcite . upon tuning the dipole coupling strength , the boundary theory is found in a phase of either fermi liquid , non - fermi liquid or mott insulator .",
    "we remark that while the extremal ads rn background , without dipole coupling , was first claimed to be dual to a boundary theory of non - fermi liquid at quantum critical point @xcite , it is not clear which role does the dipole coupling play in a boundary theory of fermi liquid .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to explicitly investigate the dipole coupling effect on a particular boundary theory of fermi liquid , which is dual to the charged dilatonic black hole by gubser and rocha .    at last ,",
    "we summarize our finding as follows :    * we have found the structure of fermi surface constructed by gubser and rocha is _ rigid _ regardless the presence of dipole coupling .",
    "there is no sign about the fermi / non - fermi liquid transition by varying bulk dipole coupling . *",
    "fermi momentum can be linearly shifted by the dipole coupling strength . *",
    "a gap appears for large dipole coupling strength , as a generic feature of dipole interaction .",
    "however , the gap might not be the mott one , since we could not observe any clear sign of spectral weight transfer from the spectral function . *",
    "the gap persists at finite temperature for large enough dipole coupling .    in the next two sections ,",
    "we briefly describe the geometry of dilatonic black hole constructed in @xcite , and dirac equation in this background . in section 4",
    ", we show the rigidity of fermi surface of this background under the bulk dipole coupling . in section 5",
    ", we show the emergence of a gap at zero and finite temperature .",
    "conclusions and discussions are addressed in the end .",
    "in this section , we review gubser and rocha s construction of a charged dilatonic black hole , which is claimed dual to a boundary theory of fermi liquid .",
    "the three - equal - charge black hole has the following lagrangian @xcite : @xmath3 , \\label{eq : background action}\\ ] ] and the charged black hole solution is given by @xmath4 this solution is asymptotic to ads , but the ir geometry is neither lifshitz nor ads .",
    "the zero temperature is obtained by taking extremal limit where @xmath5 with vanishing horizon @xmath6 .",
    "the temperature and boundary chemical potential are given by @xcite @xmath7 it was also shown that at low temperature the entropy density @xmath8 is proportional to temperature , @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "this implies a boundary theory of fermi liquid dual to this gravity background .",
    "later it was explicitly checked that near fermi surface @xmath11 , the linear relation @xmath12 holds @xcite .",
    "now we would like to _ dope _ the system with a dipole coupling term in the bulk .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the dipole effect to the underlying fermi liquid system .",
    "we consider the bulk spinor action : @xmath13 where the flat space gamma matrices @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 is the vielbein and covariant derivative @xmath18 .",
    "the bulk dirac equation is @xmath19 taking the ansatz @xmath20 , one can remove the spin connection in the dirac equation . to decouple the equations of motion ,",
    "we introduce projectors @xmath21 and write @xmath22 . with a choice of gamma matrices @xmath23 one obtains the bulk dirac equation @xmath24 where we use the rotational symmetry in the spatial directions to set @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "set @xmath28 , and define @xmath29 , one can obtain the flow equations @xmath30 this equation is solved by imposing an in - falling condition at the horizon , such that @xmath31    we remark that the in - falling condition is not modified by the dipole coupling thanks to its subleading contribution near the horizon .",
    "the boundary retarded green function can be extracted by @xmath32 where @xmath33 note the dirac equation eq.([dirac equation ] ) implies the relation @xmath34 .",
    "so in the following sections , we will only show the 3d plots and density plots for @xmath35 and also set @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for convenience .",
    "it is shown that a simple holographic realization of finite density fermionic system exhibits single particle spectral function with sharp fermi surface of a form distinct from the landau - fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that in this finite density background ( rn - ads ) @xcite , one can find fermi or non - fermi liquid behavior by tuning the bulk dipole coupling strength @xmath40 , and then the sharp fermi surface ceases to exist for large @xmath40 . motivated by this , it is interesting to investigate if this feature is robust or not in general backgrounds .",
    "so we would like to consider the bulk dipole coupling effect in the charged dilatonic black hole in @xcite .",
    "similar to rn - ads case , we actually find a sharp quasiparticle peak around @xmath41 which indicates a fermi surface ( see figure ( [ fermi momentum ] ) ) , and the dipole coupling does not change the structure of fermi surface but just shift the location of fermi momentum . however , the height of peak dramatically decreases for large @xmath40 and is too small to be identified as a fermi surface .",
    "for instance , the peak of @xmath42 drops under @xmath43 for @xmath44 but of order of unity for @xmath45 .",
    "we do not observe any sign of non - fermi liquid numerically by tuning the dipole coupling strength @xmath40 . in the figure ( [ fig : dispersion ] ) , we show the dispersion relation near the fermi surface for various @xmath40 .",
    "the linear relation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 has a universal form : @xmath48 which implies the fermi surface constructed in @xcite is rigid and the property of fermi liquid remains regardless of the bulk dipole coupling .",
    "the group velocity @xmath49 can also be read off as @xmath50 for @xmath51 and slows down for larger @xmath40 , say @xmath52 for @xmath53 .    according to the numerical result , for massless dirac fermion and zero frequency",
    ", we can see the pole of green function is shifted linearly up to some value of @xmath40 , before the whole system enters the insulator phase where the pole disappears . in the figure ( [ fig : pk ] ) , the shift of fermi momentum is plotted against various dipole coupling strength @xmath40 .",
    "the numerical result shows the best fit for relation : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the numerically - found fermi momentum at @xmath56 .",
    "we also find there exists some negative @xmath40 at which the fermi momentum goes through zero , signifying that the excitations change over from `` particle - like '' to `` hole - like '' , as similar to rn - ads case .    in the following ,",
    "we show that analytical arguments , by examining the retarded green function for massless dirac field at both near horizon and asymptotic limit , may shed some light to understand above - mentioned numerical results :      taking the near horizon limit , where @xmath57 for extremal case , one obtains the following asymptotic equation from ( [ eom_flow ] ) and ( [ eom_green ] ) : @xmath58g_\\pm{}^2 +   \\bigg [ \\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}}\\omega r^{-3/2}\\mp \\frac{k}{r } - p\\frac{\\sqrt{3}q^{3/4}}{l^2}r^{-3/4 } \\bigg].\\ ] ] here we intended to keep all subleading terms in order to see that the term with dipole coupling @xmath40 is least dominated at @xmath57 limit .",
    "this implies that @xmath40 plays insignificant role in the ir physics , therefore the property of fermi liquid is hardly affected by the dipole coupling .      taking the asymptotic limit , where @xmath59 , one obtains the following equation instead : @xmath60 g_{\\pm}{}^2 + r ^{2m-2}\\bigg [ \\omega -\\sqrt{3}qq + ( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}pq^2}{l^2 } \\mp",
    "k ) \\bigg].\\ ] ] one can immediately see that this differential equation is invariant under the shift symmetry : @xmath61 though this shift symmetry is not exact in the sense that it is only respected in the asymptotic region , it still well manifests as the linear relation found numerically in equation ( [ linear_relation ] ) .",
    "at last , it is not difficult to show that at both limits , the retarded green function involves the tangent function . in particular , for @xmath59 , we have @xmath62 which is a semi - periodic function over full range of @xmath47 , with a discontinuous jump at some @xmath47 ( the root of @xmath63 ) and constant of integration @xmath64 .",
    "one is tempted to compare this periodicity of retarded green function with the log - periodicity appeared in the rn - ads case@xcite .",
    "as it was first observed in @xcite , the bulk dipole coupling plays some role of mott physics .",
    "a gap is formed for large coupling strength in the insulator phase .",
    "in addition to the formation of a gap , the spectral weight also transfers from one band to another band .",
    "we will show an emergent gap in the background studied in @xcite .      before turning on the dipole coupling",
    ", there is a sharp peak in the negative frequency , and one quasiparticle peak in the positive frequency which is more dispersive than the negative frequency one ( see fig .",
    "this is contradiction with rn - ads case in which there is only one quasiparticle peak .",
    "moreover , the height of peak in the lower band is much higher than the one in upper band when the momentum smaller than the fermi momentum in the absence of dipole coupling .    turning on the dipole coupling",
    ", we find that when @xmath40 is larger than some critical value @xmath65 ( @xmath66 in this case ) , a gap between two peaks opens ( see fig .",
    "besides , as we increase @xmath40 , the width of gap is larger and the height of both peaks becomes higher .",
    "this is different than the case in rn - ads , where the original peak degrades and the spectral density starts to appear in the other band , namely the phenomena of spectral weight transfer happens . as @xmath40 is higher , the peak ceases to exist indicating the fermi surface has disappeared .",
    "so the resulting phase is insulator phase .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the sharp fermi surface is smoothed at finite temperature .",
    "also the mott gap generated by the bulk dipole coupling will vanish above some critical temperature .",
    "the critical value of the ratio @xmath67 is small ( @xmath68 ) for rn - ads black hole .",
    "however , we find that the critical value of ratio @xmath67 in the dilatonic black hole studied in @xcite is higher than the one in rn - ads . from figure [ finite t ] , the dynamically generated gap still exists at the finite temperature for large enough dipole coupling .",
    "the width of gap also increases as the dipole coupling increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical value of @xmath67 is higher for larger @xmath40 .",
    "in the holographic model of non - fermi liquid @xcite , it was found that the bulk dipole coupling changed the attainable low - energy scaling dimensions , as well as the locations of the fermi momentum .",
    "the structure of non - fermi liquids is , however , robust under this deformation .",
    "on the other hand , it was also found that one could find ( non-)fermi liquid behavior in different range of coupling strength by varying the coupling strength and a mott gap is dynamically generated by the bulk dipole coupling for large dipole coupling @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dynamically generated gap will close when the temperature is turned on and above some critical value . conclusively , a phase diagram similar to the one of high-@xmath69 cuprate superconductor was found .    in this note , we have investigated a particular holographic model of fermi liquid , proposed by gubser and rocha @xcite .",
    "similar to the non - fermi liquid model , we find the bulk dipole coupling change the location of fermi momentum and the fermi surface structure is robust under this deformation .",
    "interestingly , it was also found that the dipole coupling linearly shifted the locations of the fermi momentum , and we did not find any signature of non - fermi liquid . with increasing coupling strength , the mobility of quasiparticle is decreasing and a dynamically generated gap is observed . as the coupling strength is getting higher ,",
    "the fermi surface ceases to exist , and the system ends in an insulator phase .    in the holographic models of non - fermi liquid ,",
    "the near horizon of extremal rn - ads black hole is @xmath70 , indicating the ir physics is well captured by an emergent @xmath71 dimensional cft . besides",
    ", it is argued that the ir scaling dimension of probe fermion plays an important role in the fermi surface structure .",
    "one can apply some semi - analytical method to obtain the analytical properties of retarded green s function in low energy limit",
    ". however , there seems a big difference from those models that the class of quantum critical point ( qcp ) we consider here connects fermi liquid phase to insulator phase and does not have an explicit cft description near - horizon geometry , its lifted eleven dimensional three - equal - charge solution at extremal limit does have a @xmath72 near - horizon factor , which is claimed to be dual to a non - chiral cft and responsible for the linear specific heat . ] .",
    "so the semi - analytical arguments used in the non - fermi liquid case might not apply to this case .",
    "it would be interesting to have an analytical understanding of the low energy behavior of excitations around fermi surface by performing the matching calculations",
    ".    it would be also interesting to investigate other holographic models of qcp which associate with ( non-)fermi liquid and possibly classify various types of qcp .",
    "for example , it is shown that in the charged dilatonic black hole with liouville potential , one can find both fermi and non - fermi liquid behavior when we tune the nonminimal coupling strength and dilaton potential @xcite .",
    "another type of qcp is associated to lifshitz - like theory .",
    "we hope to explore the effect of dipole coupling in those backgrounds and report the results in the future@xcite .",
