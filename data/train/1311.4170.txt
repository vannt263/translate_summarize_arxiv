    "@xmath1 is defined as the quotient space of the set of smooth integrable complex operators compatible with the orientation ( o.c . ) @xmath2 by @xmath3 , the connected component of the identity in the oriented diffeomorphism group @xmath4 of @xmath0 .",
    "the theory of teichmller spaces is a cornerstone in complex variables and riemann surfaces .",
    "originated by riemann himself and followed by the fundamental works of teichmller , ahlfors and bers , it has moreover implications in many branches of mathematics as algebraic geometry , hyperbolic geometry , complex dynamics , discrete groups , ...    perhaps the most basic property of @xmath1 is that it has a natural structure of a complex manifold , making it a global moduli space of complex structures on @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the mapping class group of @xmath0 acts on @xmath1 and the resulting quotient is a complex orbifold .",
    "this refined quotient coincides with the quotient of @xmath5 by the full group @xmath4 , the so - called riemann moduli space @xmath6 .",
    "+ let now @xmath0 be a smooth oriented compact manifold of even dimension @xmath7 strictly greater than @xmath8 .",
    "the teichmller and riemann moduli spaces can still be defined , but one now has to add the integrability condition in the definition @xmath9\\subset t^{1,0}\\}\\ ] ] for @xmath10 although the literature about these higher dimensional teichmller and riemann moduli spaces is much less developed than that about surfaces , it has grown significantly in the last years and these spaces play an increasing role in complex geometry .",
    "catanese s guide to deformations and moduli @xcite gives some general local properties of @xmath1 and contains many results on the teichmller space of minimal surfaces of general type . and",
    "in the special case of hyperkhler manifolds , the teichmller space is used by verbitsky in a prominent way in his proof of a global torelli theorem @xcite and also to showing some important results on these manifolds @xcite .",
    "however , the main difference with the case of surfaces is that @xmath1 and @xmath6 are _ just topological spaces _ and do not have any good geometric structure . only for special classes as that of hyperkhler manifolds ,",
    "an analytic structure is known on @xmath1 , but even in this case , it is not hausdorff at all points .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic example is given by @xmath0 being @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath6 , _ as a set _ , is @xmath12 , a point @xmath13 corresponding to the hirzebruch surface @xmath14 ( and each connected component of @xmath1 is @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 encoding the same surface , see examples [ hirzebruch ] and [ hirzebruchbis ] ) .",
    "but , _ as a topological space _ , it is @xmath12 endowed with a non - hausdorff topology .",
    "no two points are separated , as a consequence of the fact that @xmath14 can be deformed onto any @xmath18 with @xmath19 by an arbitrary small deformation .",
    "equivalently , this comes from the fact that the dimension of the automorphism group of hirzebruch surfaces jumps .",
    "moreover , in presence of this jumping phenomenon , @xmath1 and @xmath6 are not even locally hausdorff hence not locally isomorphic to an analytic space ( cf .",
    "example [ hopfbis ] ) .",
    "in fact , it is well - known since the fundamental works of kodaira - spencer and kuranishi that in higher dimension the global point of view must be abandoned for the local point of view ; and the teichmller space replaced with the kuranishi space which must be thought of as the best possible approximation in the analytic category for a local moduli space of complex structures . + nevertheless , to go further in the study of the higher dimensional teichmller and riemann spaces , it is fundamental to understand their global analytic structure .",
    "as we can not expect a structure of analytic space , even a non - hausdorff one , _ we have to view these quotient spaces as stacks_. the aim of this paper is to investigate the structure of these stacks in higher dimension .",
    "since we work with arbitrary complex structures and not only with projective ones , we consider them as analytic stacks , defined over the category of complex manifolds , or that of @xmath20-analytic spaces .",
    "+ for surfaces of genus @xmath21 , the classical results can be reformulated in terms of stacks as : both @xmath1 and @xmath6 are deligne - mumford analytic stacks isomorphic to stacks of families of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath22 . moreover , all isotropy groups of @xmath1 are trivial whereas the isotropy group of @xmath6 at a point coincides with the automorphism group of this point . the case of genus @xmath23 is somewhat more complicated , because of the translations .",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are artin analytic stacks , isomorphic to stacks of families of complex tori of dimension one .",
    "+ in higher dimension , one has to build these stacks from the local data encoded in the kuranishi space .",
    "one should expect that the local model of the riemann moduli stack , respectively of the teichmller stack , at a complex structure @xmath26 is the kuranishi space of @xmath27 endowed with the action of its automorphisms , respectively of the automorphisms which are @xmath28-isotopic to the identity .",
    "+ this is however not correct .",
    "a third element is missing .",
    "some orbits of @xmath3 may a priori have a complicated geometry and accumulate onto @xmath26 .",
    "this induces additional identifications to be done to pass from the kuranishi space to the riemann or teichmller space , even in the absence of automorphisms .",
    "+ the main problem behind this stack construction is to understand how to glue the bunch of kuranishi spaces , in other words how to keep track of all identifications to be done not only on a single kuranishi space but also between different ones .",
    "+ this is achieved here by describing the space of complex structures @xmath29 as a foliated space transversely modeled at @xmath26 on the translation groupoid encoding the local actions of the automorphisms on the kuranishi space of @xmath27 .",
    "then , we describe the stacky structure of the leaf space . + a natural source of stacks is given by ( leaf spaces of ) foliations .",
    "such stacks admit a presentation by an tale groupoid , the holonomy groupoid @xcite . in general",
    ", the action of @xmath3 onto @xmath29 does not define a foliation , nor a lamination .",
    "but we show that it defines a more complicated foliated structure , that we call a foliation transversely modeled on a translation groupoid , a tg foliation in short , see section [ multifoliate ] .",
    "we then turn to the construction of an associated holonomy groupoid .",
    "it is however much more involved than the classical construction and it constitutes the bulk of the paper .",
    "indeed , the transverse structure of a tg foliation being well defined only up to morita equivalence , the holonomy morphisms are stacks morphisms and do not fit into a nice groupoid .",
    "hopefully , in the case of the teichmller and the riemann stacks , we can do much better and define a holonomy groupoid which moreover enjoys nice properties .",
    "from the one hand , objects and morphisms form a finite - dimensional analytic space , and from the other hand , source and target maps are smooth morphisms .",
    "the teichmller and the riemann stacks admitting these nice groupoids as a presentation , we call them artin analytic stacks . the set of objects is a ( countable ) disjoint union of kuranishi spaces .",
    "we describe completely the set of morphisms encoding the identifications of structures to be done on the collection of kuranishi spaces .",
    "all this can be seen as an answer to question 1.8 of @xcite .",
    "the only condition needed for this result to hold is that the dimension of the automorphism group of all structures of @xmath1 ( or @xmath6 ) is bounded by a fixed integer .",
    "this is nevertheless a mild restriction since we may easily stratify @xmath29 into strata where this dimension is bounded .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath0 can be any compact manifold and that we consider all complex structures and not only projective or khler ones modulo @xmath3 or @xmath4 . ] .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "some notations and classical facts about the kuranishi space are introduced in section [ notations ] .",
    "we then give some general properties of @xmath29 in section [ f - homotopy ] , putting emphasis on connectedness properties , and introducing a graph , called the _ graph of @xmath30-homotopy_. the tg foliation of the space @xmath29 is introduced in section [ tgfoliationsection ] .",
    "the technical core of the paper is constituted by sections [ multifoliate ] and [ teichmueller ] , where we perform the construction of the analogue for the holonomy groupoid .",
    "we call it _ the teichmller groupoid_. to smoothe the difficulties of the construction , a sketch of it is given in section [ holonomy ] and a very simple case is treated in section [ rigidified ] .",
    "all this culminates in the proof of the main theorem [ maintheorem ] , stating that the teichmller groupoid is an analytic smooth presentation of the teichmller stack .",
    "analogous construction and statement for the riemann moduli stack are done in sections [ riemann ] and [ main ] .",
    "we also show that both stacks are isomorphic to stacks of families of complex manifolds .",
    "this is of course not a surprise but it is important to link the theory of teichmller and riemann moduli stacks to the classical deformation theory of kodaira - spencer .",
    "complete examples are given in section [ examples ] .",
    "+ we hope that this paper will serve as a source of motivation for studying global moduli problems in complex analytic geometry and their interplay with artin analytic stacks . from the one hand ,",
    "every abstract result on these stacks might apply to moduli problems and increase our knowledge of complex manifolds . from the other hand ,",
    "examples of teichmller stacks are an unending source of examples of artin analytic stacks , showing all the complexity and richness of their structure , far from finite dimensional group actions and leaf spaces .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth ( i.e. @xmath28 ) oriented compact connected manifold of even dimension .",
    "let @xmath31 , respectively @xmath29 , be the space of smooth almost complex , respectively complex operators on @xmath0 which are compatible with the orientation .",
    "the definition of @xmath29 is given in .",

    "+ for @xmath34 a topological space , we denote by @xmath35 the set of connected components of @xmath34 .",

    "it is a frchet lie group @xcite acting analyticallythere is some subtle point here because the complex structure of @xmath4 depends on the choice of a complex structure on @xmath0 .",

    "we just review some definitions about groupoids and stacks .",
    "we define a stack as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "we insist on the fact that we work exclusively in the @xmath20-analytic context . to be more precise we consider only stacks defined over the category of complex manifolds or that of @xmath20-analytic spaces .",
    "we also emphasize that we use the euclidean topology , not the tale or the analytic ones .",
    "hence our families of coverings are just standard topological open coverings .",
    "+ the groupoids we consider are analytic , that is that the set of objects and the set of morphisms are complex analytic spaces ( possibly non - hausdorff for the second one ) and all the structure maps are analytic morphisms .",
    "we emphasize that a smooth analytic groupoid is not a complex lie groupoid , since we allow singularities of both the set of objects and the set of morphisms , but it is the exact singular counterpart of a complex lie groupoid , cf .",
    "+ analytic groupoids are in particular topological so that it makes sense to localize them on an open covering of the set of objects @xcite .",
    "the geometric quotient associated to such a groupoid is the topological space obtained by taking the quotient of the set of objects by the equivalence relation defined by the set of morphisms .",
    "connected components of the groupoid refer to connected components of the geometric quotient .",
    "+ such a groupoid is tale , respectively smooth , if both source and target maps are tale , respectively smooth , morphisms .",
    "we call a stack tale analytic ( respectively artin analytic ) if it admits a presentation by an tale ( respectively smooth ) analytic groupoid ; deligne - mumford analytic if it is tale with finite stabilizers .",
    "we take as definition of morita equivalence that given in @xcite , with the obvious adaptations to the groupoids we use ( e.g. replace @xmath28 map with @xmath20-analytic map , submersion with smooth morphism , ... ) .",
    "+ by a translation groupoid , we mean a groupoid @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a lie group and where the source map is the second projection .",
    "the standard example is that of @xmath44 acting on @xmath45 , including the case of a local action , i.e. @xmath46 is not defined for all @xmath47 .",
    "but the definition is general enough to include also cases with no @xmath44-action , see subsection [ localaction ] .",
    "[ oriented ] in the first version of this paper , we take for @xmath0 an unoriented smooth compact manifold and consider @xmath29 as the set of all integrable complex operators , regardless of orientation .",
    "then @xmath1 is defined as in , and in , we have to replace the oriented diffeomorphism group by the full diffeomorphism group @xmath48 .",
    "this does not change substantially these two sets , and our results apply to this setting .",
    "in fact , the main drawback of forgetting the orientation is that the notion of teichmller space does not coincide to the classical one for surfaces . especially , the unoriented teichmller space of a compact surface has two connected components , corresponding to the two possible orientations . + more generally , if @xmath0 admits a diffeomorphism reversing orientation , then the unoriented teichmller space has twice more connected components as the classical one .",
    "however , the two riemann spaces coincide . finally ,",
    "if @xmath0 does not admit any orientation reversing diffeomorphism , then the unoriented teichmller and riemann spaces are the disjoint union of the classical ones for both orientations . notice that , in this last case , changing the orientation may completely change the teichmller and riemann spaces .",
