    "the searches for the higgs boson and new phenomena beyond the standard model of fundumental interactions are important tasks for the new particle accelerator  the large hadron collider . the most popular direction beyond the sm is low energy supersymmetry .",
    "however , it is not clear how supersymmetry is realized .",
    "the simplest case  the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite  is studied in detailes , however possible deviations from it are of great interest as well .",
    "there exists a wide class of models which contain so called @xmath0-parity breaking interactions leading to the violation of lepton and baryon numbers@xcite .",
    "these models have a number of new coupling constants , some of them are badly constrained , for instance , by rare processes , other ones are less restricted .",
    "in this letter we consider the model with the neutrino yukawa interactions and related @xmath0-parity violating term in the superpotential . the interesting consequence of including the @xmath0-parity violating @xmath1 term is the modification of the tree - level expressions for the higgs boson masses and upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass in the mssm .",
    "in this chapter we consider general features of supersymmetric theories related to the scalar potential , its minima , and masses of the physical higgs boson states .",
    "it is well known that in these theories the scalar potential is not an arbitrary function of the fields but is fixed by supersymmetry .",
    "the sources of the higgs scalar potential are @xmath3-terms coming from gauge - higgs interactions , @xmath2-terms originating from the superpotential , and soft supersymmetry breaking terms : @xmath4 in the mssm based on the @xmath5 symmetry group the @xmath3-term contribution reads @xmath6 where the sum is taken over the gauge groups , their generators , and scalar components of the chiral higgs superfields . from the @xmath0-parity conserving mssm superpotential @xmath7",
    "only the higgs mixing @xmath8-term @xmath9 gives the contribution to the @xmath2-part of the @xmath10 : @xmath11 the higgs doublets are defined as @xmath12 and the `` dot '' operation ( @xmath13 ) denotes the @xmath14 convolution of the ( super)fields doublets with the help of the totally antisymmetric @xmath15-tensor .",
    "soft supersymmetry breaking is parametrized by the mass terms for the corresponding scalar components of the higgs superfields and an analogue of the higgs mixing term @xmath16 @xmath17    the final form of the higgs scalar potential then reads @xmath18 & + & b\\mu \\left(h^+_{\\rm u}h^-_{\\rm d}-h^0_{\\rm u}h^0_{\\rm d}\\right ) + { \\rm h.c . }",

    "\\label{eq : vscal_mssm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to calculate the masses of physical higgs boson states one has to take the second derivatives of the scalar potential ( [ eq : vscal_mssm ] ) with respect to the corresponding real and imaginary components of the higgs fields taken at the minima and then diagonalize the mass - squared matrices .",
    "then one gets the following expressions@xcite for the mass of the @xmath19-odd higgs boson @xmath20 @xmath21 for the heavy and the lightest neutral @xmath19-even higgs bosons @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 and for the pair of charged higgs bosons @xmath25 @xmath26 three mass eigenstates remain zero corresponding to the goldstone bosons eaten by @xmath27 gauge bosons in the higgs mechanism .",
    "here we have introduced the standard notation @xmath28  the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two higgs boson doublets .",
    "the assumption @xmath29 in eqn.([eq : masshh ] ) leads to the well - known tree - level expression for the lightest mssm higgs boson mass @xmath30 and the famous inequality @xmath31 however , radiative corrections coming mainly from the top - stop loops badly violate this inequality@xcite . for the loop corrected lightest higgs mass one has @xmath32 which shift the mass bound upwards@xcite .",
    "renormgroup resummation of all - order leading log contributions using effective potential approach slightly changes the predictions@xcite .    besides",
    ", the mssm scenario with @xmath33 is excluded experimentally by non - observation of the higgs boson lighter than 114  gev .",
    "the superpotential of the standard model  ( [ eq : wmssm ] ) is constructed under assumption that neutrinos are massless ( there are no yukawa interactions for the neutrinos which can generate dirac neutrino mass terms after the electroweak symmetry breaking ) and the @xmath0-parity is conserved . in this case",
    "it repeats ( up to notations ) the yukawa part of the standard model lagrangian .",
    "however , it is believed nowadays that neutrinos have masses , even tiny , then the neutrino yukawa term @xmath34 in the superpotential is possible and should be included ( @xmath35 here are @xmath14 singlet right - handed neutrino superfields , and @xmath36 are neutrino yukawa couplings ) .",
    "the latter implies that one also has to include a term @xmath37 to the @xmath0-violating part ( recall that @xmath38 and @xmath39 superfields have the same quantum numbers and no symmetries but lepton number are violated ) .",
    "therefore we consider the superpotential of the model in the form : @xmath40    the soft supersymmetry breaking lagrangian also includes the following terms : @xmath41 ( @xmath42 here are scalar components of the corresponding superfields ) .    the model with this kind of superpotential has been previously considered and studied@xcite , however the authors were mainly interested in the solution of the @xmath8-problem rather than higgs mass predictions in the model .",
    "note also , that for simplicity we do not consider sneutrino v.e.v .",
    "the @xmath43 term gives the @xmath2-type contribution to the higgs self - coupling , and the higgs scalar potential now reads @xmath44 & = & \\left(|\\mu|^2 + m^2_{{\\rm h}_{\\rm u}}\\right)\\left(|h^+_{\\rm u}|^2+|h^0_{\\rm u}|^2\\right ) +      \\left(|\\mu|^2 + m^2_{{\\rm h}_{\\rm d}}\\right)\\left(|h^0_{\\rm d}|^2+|h^-_{\\rm d}|^2\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\[1 mm ] & + & b\\mu \\left(h^+_{\\rm u}h^-_{\\rm d}-h^0_{\\rm u}h^0_{\\rm d}\\right ) + { \\rm h.c .",

    "\\label{eq : vscalhr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the minimization conditions for the potential ( [ eq : vscalhr ] ) have an additional term due to new neutrino - higgs interaction ( the notation @xmath45 is introduced ) : @xmath46",
    "now it is easy to calculate the masses of the higgs bosons in our model .",
    "taking the second derivatives of the potential  ( [ eq : vscalhr ] ) with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath47 in the minimum one gets for the elements of the @xmath19-odd higgs boson mass - squared matrix : @xmath48 the mass eigenstates are then given by @xmath49 the zero eigenstate of the matrix ( [ eq : a0matrix11 ] ) @xmath50.\\ ] ] is the the goldstone boson eaten by the @xmath51 boson in the higgs mechanism , while the combination @xmath52\\ ] ] is the @xmath19-odd neutral higgs boson @xmath20 with the mass expression @xmath53 sometimes it is more convenient to use @xmath54 instead of the @xmath55 parameter , they are related via ( [ eq : massa0 ] ) .    let us now look at the masses of @xmath19-even higgs boson @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the latter corresponds to the lightest higgs boson in the mssm .",
    "the mass - squared matrix is obtained by differentiating twice the potential  ( [ eq : vscalhr ] ) with respect to the @xmath58 and @xmath59 and substituting the expression for the vacuum expectation values ( [ eq : mincon1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mincon2 ] ) .",
    "one has , for instance @xmath60 the neutral @xmath19-even higgs boson mass - squared matrix then reads @xmath61    the masses of physical eigenstates are then given by @xmath62 where the quantity @xmath63 related to the new @xmath0-violating neutrino - higgs interactions considered above reads @xmath64 in the limiting case @xmath65 one gets @xmath66 which reproduces the mssm tree - level upper bound for the lightest mssm higgs boson at @xmath67 @xmath68    thus we conclude that in our model the higgs mass constraint is less stringent .",
    "fig.[fig : hmass_vs_tan ] illustrates the dependence of the upper bound for the lightest supersymmetric higgs mass as a function of @xmath69 for various values of the @xmath70 parameter .",
    "it is easily observed that the bigger the value of @xmath70 , the higher the mass bound . in particular , this takes place for small values of @xmath69 , thus making the parameter space less constrained , and slightly open the scenario with low @xmath69 excluded in the mssm by non - observation of the higgs boson lighter than 114  gev  ( fig.[fig : param_space ] ) . for the moderate and large @xmath71",
    "the contribution proportional to @xmath72 is practically negligible , and the higgs mass bound as well as the excluded region in the parameter space practically coincides with those of the mssm .",
    "note , that the modified upper bound on the lightest higgs mass  ( [ eq : massh_nu ] ) has the same form as in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the coupling of the three @xmath14 singlet higgs superfields .    for completeness",
    "we also calculate the charged higgs boson masses which get negative contribution from the @xmath75 term .",
    "the charged higgs mass - squared matrix reads @xmath76 and the physical state mass is @xmath77 the zero mass eigenstate corresponds to the goldstone boson eaten by @xmath78-boson .",
    "we have not considered in this letter the possible bilinear @xmath0-parity violating term @xmath79 in the superpotential , since for our purposes it is practically irrelevant .",
    "its presence leads only to the redefinition of the higgs scalar potential parameters , while the higgs mass relations  ( [ eq : massa0 ] ) , ( [ eq : masshh ] ) , and ( [ eq : masshch ] ) remain unchanged .",
    "our goal is to demonstrate the possibility of relaxing the upper bound on the lightest supersymmetric higgs .",
    "in conclusion we summarize the main results of this letter .",
    "we have shown that introducing the yukawa interactions of neutrinos @xmath80 leading to their dirac mass terms and consequently the possible @xmath0-parity violating terms @xmath81 modifies the expressions of the higgs boson masses since the latter gives @xmath2-type contribution to the higgs scalar potential .",
    "the final expressions for the higgs masses in our toy model are ( [ eq : massa0 ] ) , ( [ eq : masshh ] ) , ( [ eq : masshch ] ) and the tree - level bound on the lightest supersymmetric higgs boson @xmath82 gets the noticable shift upwards for small values of @xmath69 . the shift is compatible with the loop corrections to the tree - level mssm expression .",
    "this opens the part of the parameter space excluded by the non - observation of the light higgs .",
    "the situation looks like as in the nmssm ( [ eq : masshnmssm ] ) . including the bilinear @xmath0-parity violating term @xmath79 will not crucially affect our results .",
    "however , the more detailed study is needed , and the analysis of the full @xmath0-parity violating model with the right - handed neutrinos is under study and will be published elsewhere .",
