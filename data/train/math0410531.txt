    "we prove these density theorems using the theory of _ zeta functions _ associated with _",
    "prehomogeneous vector spaces_. this method has been developed by sato - shintani @xcite , shintani @xcite , datskovsky - wright @xcite , datskovsky @xcite and also by kable , yukie and the author . in the beautiful work of wright - yukie @xcite",
    ", they showed that 8 types of prehomogeneous vector space possess significant interest in arithmetic , and laid out a program to prove a series of density theorems .",
    "there are some advantages to using this theory .",
    "for example , at the moment this approach is the only possible way that allows the ground field to be a general number field rather than just @xmath38 , as is done in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with the representation @xmath52 which is referred to as the @xmath53 case in @xcite .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the principal parts of the zeta function of this type are closely related to the asymptotic behavior of the mean value of @xmath24 of quadratic extensions @xmath27 .",
    "however , the global theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces is difficult in general and more than ten meaningful cases including the case @xmath54 are left open .",
    "our approach to work on this topic is to consider inner forms .",
    "let @xmath55 be a quaternion algebra of @xmath0 and @xmath56 the opposite algebra .",
    "we regard @xmath57 and @xmath58 as algebraic groups over @xmath0 . in this paper , we consider the representation @xmath59 which is an inner form of @xmath60 . note that if @xmath55 splits then @xmath60 is equivalent to @xmath54 .",
    "we call @xmath60 the _ space of pairs of quaternion algebras_. as we saw in @xcite , the orbit space of @xmath61 also carries a rich structure .",
    "we recall the fundamental properties of this space in section [ sec : rev ] .",
    "one advantage of non - split cases is that the global theory becomes much easier . in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath60 when @xmath55 is a division algebra over a number field @xmath0 .",
    "for this case , we determined the principal parts of the global zeta function in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as we will see in proposition [ zetaseries ] , the global zeta function is only an approximation of the counting function of @xmath24 of quadratic extensions .",
    "hence we could not directly deduce theorem [ introtheorem ] from the global theory @xcite , and what the aim of this paper is to fill out this gap by carrying out what is called the _ filtering process _ originally developed by datskovsky - wright @xcite and datskovsky @xcite .",
    "this process requires a local theory in some detail .",
    "we consider the localizations of @xmath60 at each place of @xmath0 .",
    "except for a finite set of places of @xmath0 the quaternion @xmath55 splits , and the localizations of @xmath60 at those places are equivalent to @xmath54 .",
    "there also exists an outer form of the representation @xmath54 , namely _ the space of pairs of binary hermitian forms_. the necessary local theory and the filtering process for that case was constructed by kable - yukie @xcite , and certain new density theorems were obtained using the yukie s global theory @xcite .",
    "some results obtained in @xcite are useful for us , because they also consider the split form @xmath54 in local situations .",
    "we quote from @xcite a uniform estimate of the standard local zeta functions and some evaluated constants .",
    "after we prove theorem [ maintheorem ] , we consider on the correlation coefficient in the final section combined with the results of @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting phenomenon that the density is purely of the euler product form as is stated in theorem [ introcor ] .    in @xcite",
    "we handled one more prehomogeneous vector space which is a non - split form of so called @xmath62-type .",
    "the density theorem for that case , should be the mean value of @xmath37 of certain families of cubic extensions @xmath23 of @xmath0 , will be treated in a separate paper .",
    "also in @xcite we develop the global theory with general quasi - characters but in this paper we only treat the principal quasi - character case .",
    "the study with non - principal characters will enrich arithmetic results as is done in @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "we hope this to be developed in the future .    for the remainder of this section , we will give the contents of the paper . in section [ sec : not ] ,",
    "we introduce the notations used throughout the paper .",
    "more specialized notations are introduced when required . in section [ sec : rev ] , we define the space of pairs of quaternion algebras , and recall from @xcite its basic properties . in section [ sec :",
    "inv ] , we first define various invariant measures on the groups and the representation spaces .",
    "after that we introduce the global zeta function and review its analytic properties .    from section [ sec",
    ": can ] to section [ sec : inf ] , we consider the local theory .",
    "we establish the necessary local theory to obtain the density theorem in these sections . in section [ sec : can ] , we define a measure on the stabilizer for semi - stable points , which is in some sense canonical . in section [ sec : loc ] , we define the local zeta function and the local density .",
    "also we quote from @xcite an estimate of the standard local zeta function , which we need in order to apply the filtering process in the proof of the mean value theorem in section [ sec : mea ] . in sections",
    "[ sec : fin ] , [ sec : ram ] and [ sec : inf ] , we compute the local densities . section [ sec : fin ] is for finite unramified places ( the places @xmath55 splits ) , section [ sec : ram ] for finite ramified places , and section [ sec : inf ] for infinite places .",
    "the unramified cases were almost done in @xcite and we essentially quote their result , but we will give a refinement for dyadic places by applying the method developed in @xcite .",
    "after that we study the ramified cases .    in section [ sec : mea ]",
    "we go back to the adelic situation .",
    "we first define some invariant measures and show that our zeta function is more or less the counting function of the unnormalized tamagawa numbers of the stabilizers .",
    "after that we apply the filtering process to our case and find the mean value of the tamagawa numbers .",
    "then with an explicit computation , we give a formula for the mean value of the square of class numbers times regulators for certain family of quadratic extensions , which is a main theorem of this paper . in section",
