    "classical secret sharing ( css ) introduced by shamir @xcite is an important primitive of protection of a secret classical information .",
    "it involves a dealer who distributes a secret amongst a group of @xmath1 parties ( players ) in a way that prevents all unauthorized subsets of players ( referred to as the adversary structure ) from reconstructing this state and permits authorized subsets ( referred to as the access structure ) to successfully reconstruct the state .    in quantum information theory , where the quantum state itself is",
    "a repository of information , protection of this state is of paramount importance . the quantum version of secret sharing ( qss ) @xcite will likely play a key role in protecting secret quantum information , e.g.  in secure operations of distributed quantum computation , sharing difficult  to  construct ancilla states and joint sharing of quantum money , as examples of the versatility of qss  @xcite .",
    "other examples of quantum security include quantum key distribution @xcite , protection of a classical secret by quantum means in the presence of eavesdroppers @xcite , and quantum bit commitment @xcite .",
    "whereas quantum secret sharing has been developed for discrete variables @xcite , here we develop continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum secret sharing and show how it can be implemented using optical interferometry and squeezed light sources  @xcite . both the theory and the proposed experimental realization",
    "are quite different from their discrete variable counterparts , yet serve the name goal : sharing secret quantum states .",
    "cv quantum information theory has achieved enormous success in quantum teleportation  @xcite and quantum computation  @xcite , and continuous - variable quantum secret sharing can be expected to play a key role in future integrated cv quantum information systems .",
    "the recent explosion of work going into linear optical quantum computation is an example of the importance of interferometric approaches to quantum information @xcite , and our proposal fits well with this rapidly growing subfield of quantum information research .",
    "we develop the @xmath2 threshold quantum secret sharing protocol for passive linear interferometry , and our protocols for higher threshold qss schemes require squeezed light .",
    "we show that finite squeezing limits the fidelity of the reconstructed secret quantum state , and we establish a lower bound on fidelity for the @xmath3 threshold scheme .",
    "this lower bound is a criterion for establishing that genuine qss ( as opposed to classical secret sharing ) has been achieved .",
    "finally we discuss the extension of our protocol to non - threshold qss schemes .",
    "in contrast to the case of discrete - variable qss  @xcite , continuous - variable qss involves states in infinite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "quantum information theory in infinite dimensional hilbert spaces is a feature of working with continuous variables  @xcite . in the qss scheme discussed here ,",
    "the secret state @xmath4 from an infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath5 is encoded into an entangled state @xmath6 as @xmath1 shares , one for each player .",
    "the entanglement is designed so that entanglement swapping operations @xcite by authorized groups of players can recover the secret state , and unauthorized groups recover no information whatsoever about the secret state .",
    "we will consider first the threshold quantum secret sharing scheme for cv . whereas secret sharing",
    "is concerned with general adversary and access structures , threshold secret sharing considers a particular access structure . for  @xmath1 players , the access structure for @xmath7 threshold",
    "secret sharing  @xcite is the set consisting of all groupings of  @xmath8 or more players , and the adversary structure is the set of all groupings consisting of fewer than  @xmath8 players .",
    "we will discuss in detail the @xmath9 threshold scheme .",
    "the general @xmath7 scheme , with @xmath10 , can be achieved from @xmath9 scheme by having the dealer discard @xmath11 shares prior to dealing the state  @xmath12 , and threshold schemes with @xmath13 are not possible due to the non - cloning theorem @xcite . in the @xmath9 threshold scheme ,",
    "the dealer s state  @xmath12 may be operated on by @xmath8 collaborators to produce the output state @xmath14 .",
    "ideally , @xmath15 is a product of the original secret state  @xmath4 and @xmath16 pairwise entangled states , each in the hilbert space @xmath17 , where the @xmath18 and @xmath19 player is a collaborator and adversary ( or non - collaborating player ) , respectively .",
    "this entanglement of states between collaborator and adversary ensures that adversaries do not acquire any information whatsoever about  @xmath4 .",
    "we introduce a continuous - variable representation for the secret state @xmath20 as @xmath21 for  @xmath22 the eigenstate of the canonical position operator  @xmath23 , and the eigenvalue spectrum is @xmath24 .",
    "the eigenstates of  @xmath23 are not normalizable but satisfy the orthogonality relation @xmath25 in an optical system , this is the quadrature - phase representation , which can be measured via optical homodyne detection  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath26 a vector from the @xmath8-dimensional vector space @xmath27 for the canonical positions of @xmath8 players , the dealer implements a particular linear mapping @xmath28 the linear mapping  @xmath29 is constrained by the requirement ( which can always be satisfied  @xcite ) that the components of any @xmath8-element subset of @xmath30 are linearly independent .",
    "the mapping  @xmath29 is used by the dealer to encode  @xmath4 into the entangled state @xmath31 ( which is not normalizable for the same reason that  @xmath32 is not normalizable ) .",
    "the encoding  ( [ encoding ] ) enables @xmath4 to be reconstructed from any @xmath8 shares as follows .",
    "let  @xmath33 be an arbitrary permutation of indices @xmath34 .",
    "as both sets @xmath35 and @xmath30 are linearly independent , there exists a non - singular @xmath36 matrix  @xmath37 such that @xmath38 given  @xmath37 , there exists a unitary operator @xmath39 such that @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath42 in the continuous basis @xmath43 are @xmath44 with @xmath45 the matrix elements of  @xmath37 .",
    "the collaborators with shares indexed by @xmath46 reconstruct the secret by transforming their shares via  @xmath42 , which results in the total state of all shares @xmath47 with  @xmath48 the jacobian for the transformation from  @xmath49 to @xmath50 and @xmath51 equation  ( [ product ] ) shows that the @xmath52 share is the secret state @xmath4 and shares @xmath53 are maximally entangled with the shares of the adversaries ( see fig .",
    "[ reconst ] ) .",
    "thus the quantum secret is reconstructed from any @xmath8 shares via a unitary transformation , and any @xmath16 shares produces no information about  @xmath4 whatsoever as tracing over the remaining @xmath8 shares yields a multiple of the identity operator .",
    "important components of the state  ( [ product ] ) are the ( unnormalized and ideal ) epr states  @xcite @xmath54 ( see eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) ) such that @xmath55 .",
    "these states can be approximated by the strongly squeezed two - mode vacuum states  @xcite @xmath56 that have the representation @xmath57 for  @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 the fock state .",
    "as @xmath61 it holds @xmath62 and hence @xmath63 .",
    "the share @xmath64 of @xmath56 , after tracing over the share @xmath65 , behaves locally as a thermal state @xmath66 with temperature @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes the boltzmann constant ; the limit @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath70 .",
    "now we show how to implement the above reconstruction procedure experimentally . given @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ mapping : t ] ) , there exists @xmath71 corresponding to @xmath37 mapping the canonical position and @xmath72 mapping the corresponding canonical momenta , for @xmath73 the transpose .",
    "the symplectic transformation @xmath74 can be decomposed into a sequence of su(2 ) and su(1,1 ) transformations @xcite that perform passive and active ( squeezing ) operations on the shares . physically",
    ", such transformations can be realized by the combined su(2 ) and su(1,1 ) interferometry @xcite that uses beam splitters , mirrors , phase shifters and squeezers .",
    "the secret and shares are then distinct spatial modes of light , and an interferometer can be designed by any group of @xmath8 collaborators to yield the secret at one output port when the shares are injected to the input ports .    the encoding of the secret by the dealer can also be performed via ( active ) interferometry ( again a symplectic transformation ) . for a chosen permutation of indices ,",
    "the dealer creates the state ( [ product ] ) and employing a suitable interferometer applies @xmath75 to this state in order to obtain @xmath12 . in summary",
    ", the dealer can encode the secret state @xmath4 in a @xmath76 mode entangled state @xmath12 via interferometry which can be decoded by any @xmath8 collaborators also by interferometry .",
    "as has been mentioned at the start , the general @xmath7 threshold scheme can be achieved by having the dealer discard @xmath77 shares .",
    "we will give an example of the @xmath3 threshold scheme .",
    "the dealer chooses @xmath78 and constructs the corresponding interferometer with a 50/50 beam splitter ( bs ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ 23scheme ]  ( a ) .",
    "this interferometer transforms the initial state @xmath79 to the three - mode entangled state @xmath80 the secret can then be reconstructed from any two shares . by combining shares 1 and 2 on a 50/50 bs ( fig .",
    "[ 23scheme ]  ( b ) ) , thereby transforming the canonical positions of the two shares via @xmath81 the first share is left in the secret state @xmath4 . similarly by combining the first and third shares on a non - degenerate parametric down - conversion crystal , pumped by a coherent field ( see fig .",
    "[ 23scheme ]  ( c ) ) , that transforms the canonical positions via @xmath82 the first share is left in the secret state @xmath4 .",
    "a similar procedure can be employed for shares 2 and 3 to reconstruct the secret .",
    "a surprisingly simple @xmath2 quantum secret sharing threshold scheme can be derived from the previous @xmath3 scheme by discarding the third share .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) reduced density operator of the first two shares after tracing over the last share is @xmath83 for @xmath42 the unitary operator induced by @xmath84 according to eqs .",
    "( [ unitrans ] ) and ( [ uelem ] ) , and @xmath85 the unit operator . as the thermal state @xmath86 is a multiple of the unit operator , the state of the two shares can be also obtained by mixing the secret @xmath4 with a thermal state of infinite temperature on a 50/50 bs ( see fig .",
    "[ 22scheme ] ) .",
    "the encoding of the secret is thus performed by simply mixing it with a thermal state on a bs , whereas the reconstruction is accomplished via recombining the two shares on another 50/50 bs . as a result",
    ", the players obtain the secret state as well as the thermal state from the two bs output ports .",
    "whereas infinite temperature is necessary for ideal @xmath2 quantum secret sharing threshold scheme , @xmath86 contains on average an infinite number of photons so any finite error in the encoding or reconstruction process will produce infinitely many photons from output port  1 of the bs and thereby destroy the secret completely . therefore a finite - temperature @xmath66 must be employed instead , and in the general case of @xmath7 threshold scheme , finitely squeezed two - mode vacuum states must replace epr states for the same reason .",
    "this will generally compromise the secret sharing fidelity , i.e. , the overlap of the reconstructed state and the original secret state @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the ( generally mixed ) state obtained as the result of reconstruction . consider a dealer using an interferometer as in fig .",
    "[ 23scheme ]  ( a ) for the encoding process , where a two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath89 replaces the epr state at the two inputs . clearly , players 1 and 2 can still reconstruct the secret perfectly while players 1 and 3 or players 2 and 3 can not .",
    "if the secret is a coherent state , the fidelity for players 1 and 3 is @xmath90 ( see fig .  [ fidelity ] ) .",
    "if @xmath91 ( no squeezing ) , the players can still achieve @xmath92 . this fidelity threshold can be used to verify whether a genuine quantum secret sharing has taken place in this particular @xmath3 threshold scheme .",
    "to conclude , we have developed a theory of quantum secret sharing using cv and shown how encoding and reconstruction processes could be achieved via ( active ) multimode interferometry for the @xmath7 threshold scheme .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath2 schemes have been presented in detail , including an allowance for finite squeezing and a minimum fidelity necessary to demonstrate that genuine secret sharing has been performed .",
    "the @xmath2 threshold scheme is achievable with current technology .",
    "the @xmath7 threshold scheme is readily generalized to an arbitrary adversary structure @xmath93 by analogy with the discrete - variable schemes based on monotone span programs @xcite . for any adversary structure @xmath93",
    ", there exists a self - dual structure @xmath94 ( @xmath94 is self - dual iff , for any division of the set of all players into two disjoint groups , exactly one group is able to reconstruct the secret ) , from which @xmath93 can be obtained by discarding some shares @xcite . for the self - dual adversary structure @xmath94 , the encoding procedure of the dealer and decoding procedures of the collaborating players can again be realized by linear mappings of the canonical positions by employing a suitable interferometer . for a total of @xmath1 players , the initial state of the dealer",
    "consists of the secret @xmath4 and @xmath95 single - mode infinitely squeezed vacuum states @xcite .",
