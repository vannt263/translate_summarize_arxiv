    "physicists have taken numerous approaches to modeling infectious diseases , ranging from simple , deterministic compartmental models that qualitatively describe disease dynamics in single populations  @xcite , to highly complex , stochastic metapopulation models that can account for the spread of emergent infectious diseases on a global scale  @xcite .",
    "simple models , designed to investigate the basic mechanisms underlying disease dynamics , typically assume that a population is well - mixed , that interacting individuals are identical and that stochastic effects are negligible  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "complex computational models are manufactured to predict the time - course of actual emergent infectious diseases such as h1n1 in 2009  @xcite , sars in 2003  @xcite quantitatively .",
    "they typically take into account data on social variability , age structure , spatial heterogeneity , seasonal variation of disease dynamic parameters , multi - scale mobility networks , and account for stochastic effects . both classes of models fulfill equally important , complementary , but almost mutually exclusive purposes .",
    "theoretical epidemiology experienced a major thrust with the advent complex network theory and its introduction into the field  @xcite .",
    "the study of network properties substantially advanced our understanding of disease dynamic phenomena on multiple levels  @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "networks were used as a model for inter - individual relationships ( social networks )  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the network approach was applied on a larger scale , modeling mobility and transport between populations  @xcite .",
    "the use of network theoretical concepts allowed researchers to investigate how topological properties of underlying networks shape the contagion processes that evolve on them  @xcite . in the context of epidemiology , mapping structural features of networks to properties of the spread of the disease substantially increased the predictive power of models and our understanding of epidemic phenomena .    although it is intuitive and plausible that network features determine the spread of a disease , it is equally plausible that an epidemic reshapes the structure of the underlying networks .",
    "for example , in response to information on an ongoing epidemic , people may change their behavior .",
    "they may decide to wear face masks , avoid contacts , and travel less .",
    "surprisingly , this feedback mechanism has been neglected even in some of the most detailed and sophisticated modeling approaches  @xcite .",
    "topological properties of social networks affect disease dynamics , and the disease then feeds back to change the topology of the network . in order to understand the dynamics of contagion phenomena in a population , it is vital to understand the consequences of this feedback mechanism .",
    "networks that change their structure in response to their environment are called _ adaptive _  @xcite . in a recent study ,",
    "gross proposed a simple adaptive network scheme , based on a _ rewiring _ rule , to understand how individuals behavioral changes impact on the time course of an epidemic . in this model ,",
    "susceptible individuals are allowed to protect themselves from infection by rewiring their existing links  @xcite .",
    "specifically , with probability @xmath0 a susceptible breaks the relationship with an infected person and forms a new link to another , randomly selected susceptible . despite the simplicity of this approach",
    ", the mechanism can generate an abundance of interesting phenomena including hysteresis and multi - stability .",
    "although this mechanism is attractive , the response to an ongoing epidemic in a population has many facets .",
    "not only do individuals avoid other infected individuals ( negative response ) . in many scenarios ,",
    "individuals increase their interaction with infected individuals ( positive response ) , particularly in hospital scenarios , and families in which individuals adopt the role of a caretaker .",
    "potentially , these positive responses can facilitate disease proliferation in a population and yield a higher disease prevalence .",
    "however , caretaker activity can have a positive effect on infected individuals , for example by increasing a person s recovery rate .",
    "a key question is how these effects interact and under what circumstances caretaker activity has a net positive or negative effect and how these effects play out in different network topologies .",
    "here we propose and investigate these questions using an adaptive network model .",
    "we consider two types of networks .",
    "first , the generic random network with binomial degree distribution , where each pair of nodes is linked with constant probability @xmath1  @xcite . we also consider scale - free networks with power law degree distributions , which more closely mimic the heterogeneity in social interactions .",
    "dynamics on scale - free networks have a number of important properties .",
    "for instance , they lack epidemic thresholds and are immune to random immunization due to strong connectivity fluctuations  @xcite . thus diseases on scale - free networks are difficult to avoid , and once they take hold , they are difficult to eradicate .",
    "we will show that in scale free topologies the highest disease extinction probabilities occur in the total absence of caretakers , a surprising result which suggests that caretaker relationships ( including doctor / patient relationships ) should be minimized in those systems . for networks",
    "we observe a critical caretaker proportion which minimizes disease severity and beyond which additional caretakers increase disease prevalence .",
    "we consider a network with a constant number of nodes @xmath2 , representing individuals in a population .",
    "each node is either susceptible ( @xmath3 ) or infected ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we denote the state variable of node @xmath5 by @xmath6 or @xmath7 , corresponding to states @xmath3 or @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "a pair @xmath8 of nodes share a weighted symmetric link @xmath9 representing their contact rate .",
    "note that in general these contact rates can have any real positive value , unlike network models that are based on binary interactions .",
    "susceptible nodes can become infected , and infected nodes can then become susceptible again upon recovery .",
    "this is the well - studied sis ( susceptible - infected - susceptible ) model @xcite .",
    "we also consider the sir ( susceptible - infected - recovered ) model where infected individuals become immune to the disease upon recovery .",
    "each link is designated either caretaker ( @xmath10 ) or regular ( @xmath11 ) , and the fraction of @xmath10 links is denoted @xmath12 .",
    "we denote this signature of a link by @xmath13 if the link is a caretaker link and @xmath14 if it is regular .",
    "these two classes represent different ways of responding to an epidemic .",
    "caretaker relationships cause nodes to increase their contact frequency @xmath15 if an attached node is infected , while regular relationships cause nodes to avoid each other ( decreasing contact rates ) . at each time step a susceptible @xmath5",
    "can become infected by one of its infected neighbors with a probability that increases with link weight .",
    "we assume that : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the propensity of disease transmission following a contact , and @xmath18 is the susceptible s contact rate with infecteds .    ]",
    "an infected individual @xmath5 recovers with propensity @xmath19 which yields the probability of recovery @xmath20 we consider two scenarios : 1 ) infected nodes recover at a uniform rate @xmath21 or 2 ) with variable probability . in the latter case , caretaker relationships increase a node s recovery probability @xmath19 according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the base recovery rate , and @xmath24 the enhanced recovery rate induced by the action of caretakers .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 represents the total exposure of an infected to caretakers and is given by @xmath26 thus @xmath25 is the total weight of caretaker interactions that node @xmath5 experiences .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 sets the scale for this exposure .",
    "the shape of the sigmoid curve can be controlled by the exponent @xmath28 .",
    "the infectious state of the system is defined by the states @xmath29 of each node .",
    "we model the adaptive nature of the network weights @xmath15 according to @xmath30 here the first term acts as the driving force of weight change , governed by the rate parameter @xmath31 .",
    "if a link is a caretaker link ( @xmath32 , and one of the adjacent nodes is infected ( @xmath7 or @xmath33 ) , this term is positive and causes the weight to increase ( if both nodes are infected the change is additive ) .",
    "regular links ( @xmath14 ) , on the other hand decrease in strength if one of the connected nodes is infected .",
    "the second term acts as a restorative force , governed by the rate parameter @xmath34 . because we investigate a system in discrete time we use the following update rule for the weights : @xmath35 ,      \\label{eq : discrete_time}\\ ] ] a discrete time reformulation of eq .  .",
    "we first consider sis dynamics . at each time step ,",
    "a randomly chosen node @xmath5 can transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 with probability @xmath36 , or from @xmath4 to @xmath3 with probability @xmath37 as given above . to study the effect of adaptive rewiring ,",
    "we first consider a system without the caretaker effect on the recovery rate , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "caretakers only increase their interaction with infected individuals .",
    "we consider a network with weights initially distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sis_time_course ] . in the absence of caretaker links ( @xmath39 ,",
    "the equilibrium endemic state @xmath40 is much lower than compared to the static network ( without rewiring ) .",
    "this is expected , as only regular ( negative ) interactions exist that decrease in response to the epidemic .",
    "the total network weight adapts to a smaller value , decreasing the endemic state .",
    "the dynamics of the disease and adaptation of the network is visible in the damped oscillation of the fraction of infecteds .",
    "however , as the fraction of caretakers is increased , diseases can attain higher endemic states than their static network counterparts .",
    "the caretaker dynamics increases the interaction rate with infecteds , effectively yielding a higher disease prevalence , which is expected .    ) for sis dynamics as a function of time for different caretaker proportions @xmath12 , where caretakers do not improve recovery .",
    "networks with adaptive rewiring were used ( solid lines ) , as well as a similar static network ( no rewiring , dashed line ) .",
    "solid lines were obtained by averaging over 100 simulations , so a single - simulation plot is overlaid in each adaptive scenario for reference .",
    "the plot corresponds to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "[ fig : sis_time_course ] ]    the system that lacks a positive caretaker effect represents a somewhat artificial limiting case .",
    "we therefore consider a positive _ caretaker effect _ : caretaker relationships lend higher recovery rates @xmath48 to infected individuals , see eq .  .",
    "in particular , we consider the effect of varying the maximum recovery rate @xmath24 and the fraction of caretaker links @xmath12 on the extinction probability of the disease .",
    "the results are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : sis_cross_sections ] and [ fig : phase_diagrams ] . in general , increasing @xmath24 yields higher extinction , since caretaker links are more effective at raising recovery rates . one would then expect that increasing the caretaker proportion @xmath12 would also yield higher extinction , as more relationships would cause increasing recovery rates . however , this is not necessarily the case . raising the caretaker proportion",
    "past some @xmath24-dependent critical value allows diseases to persist .",
    "this critical value also serves as a threshold , as increasing @xmath12 above this value rapidly decreases the extinction probability to 0 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sis_cross_sections ] . increasing @xmath12 at first yields and increased @xmath49 until a maximum is reached .",
    "a further increase leads to a rapid decrease in extinction probability . for the network ,",
    "the critical fraction of caretakers is approximately @xmath50 . for @xmath12 values above or below this ,",
    "high extinction probability is seen only for very high values of @xmath24 .",
    "note however , that even for very small fractions of caretakers , a substantial increase in extinction probability is observed .",
    "this suggests that , if the caretaker - effect is taken into account , the best strategy to extinguish a disease is the existence of a few effective caretaker relationships , that safely avoids the negative effects that emerge beyond the critical concentration .",
    "note also that for non - vanishing @xmath12 , guaranteed extinction ( @xmath51 ) is observed only for very high values of @xmath24 .     for sis dynamics as a function of caretaker proportion @xmath12 for various values of @xmath24 in an network .",
    "note a critical @xmath12 value at which extinction is maximized . approaching this value from the left yields a gradual increase in extinction , while increasing @xmath12 past this critical value causes a rapid decrease in @xmath49 .",
    "the plot corresponds to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath47 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig : sis_cross_sections ] ]    note that these results were obtained for an network . in order to investigate the interaction of network adaptation in combination with strong network heterogeneity , we investigated the dynamics in a scale free topology .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagrams ] .",
    "in contrast to the system , we observe a high extinction of the disease for a wide range of caretaker concentrations and recovery parameters @xmath55 .",
    "the disease is endemic in the adaptive , scale free network only for small @xmath55 and large @xmath56 .",
    "the implications of these results are interesting : in a scale free adaptive network , regular links that decrease when connected to infected nodes are sufficient to extinguish a disease , even in the presence of a considerable fraction of caretaker links .",
    "this strongly contrasts with the behavior observed in static scale free networks , in which the existence of strongly connected hubs generally facilitate the spread of a disease . in the adaptive network , for @xmath57 , it is sufficient that the majority of nodes decrease their interactions with the infected subpopulation . in scale - free networks , hubs that possess a large number of links will adaptively reduce the majority of their regular weights , and thus their ability to serve as a gateway of the disease to spread throughout the network . in this regime ,",
    "the effect of caretaker relationships and their effect on recovery are benign .",
    "only when the fraction of caretaker links reaches a large value such that also hubs become predominantly caretakers , the situation changes , and the disease will evolve into an endemic state .",
    "to explain these results , consider a susceptible node @xmath5 and its total rate of interaction with infected neighbors : @xmath58 the ratio of @xmath59 interaction rates and total interaction rate @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 averaging this measure over the time - course of a disease gives us a measure of the typical fraction of contacts due to si interaction : @xmath62\\ ] ] now consider this time averaged @xmath63 as a function of @xmath12 for various values of @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] . for @xmath38 ( i.e. no caretaker effect on recovery rates ) ,",
    "the rate of @xmath59 interactions increase steadily as @xmath56 is increased , yielding a more stable endemic state and high prevalence .",
    "when the caretaker effect is taken into account , we observe an initial decrease of @xmath59 interactions until a critical value is reached below which the disease will go extinct , indicated by the solid line .",
    "increasing @xmath56 further can result in increasing @xmath59 interactions beyond this critical value , entering a regime in which a large fraction of caretaker links results in a negative effect . in the scale - free network ,",
    "the qualitative behavior is similar .",
    "the crucial difference is that typically , the adaptive process of regular links is sufficient to put the fraction of @xmath59 links below the critical value even in the absence of caretaker links .",
    "next we turn out attention to the effect of caretaker adaptive networks on systems that are better described by sir dynamics . here",
    "individuals ( nodes ) exist in one of three states , susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) or recovered ( r ) .",
    "individuals can transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 with probability @xmath36 and from @xmath4 to @xmath11 with probability @xmath37 , as given above in eqs .   and .",
    "the state @xmath11 is absorbing , so once all infected nodes in a population recover , the disease dies out ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sir_time_course ] ) . in order to investigate the impact of caretaker dynamics and an sir scenario , we focus on the _ attack rate ( ratio ) _ and the _ epidemic",
    "peak_. the attack ratio ( ar ) is simply the fraction of the population which contracts the infection at some point during the epidemic .",
    "since every infected node eventually enters the recovered class , this is equivalent to the fraction of recovered nodes at the end of the epidemic : @xmath64 the epidemic peak ( ep ) is the maximum infected fraction attained in the population over the course of the epidemic .    ) for sir dynamics as a function of time for different caretaker proportions @xmath12 .",
    "networks with adaptive rewiring were used , as well as a similar static network ( no rewiring , dashed line ) .",
    "increasing @xmath12 lowers the epidemic peak as well as the attack rate .",
    "note also that the static network trace closely resembles the @xmath65 trace , showing that sir diseases in this system are not significantly affected by dynamic link weights alone .",
    "the plots correspond to @xmath66 , @xmath42 , @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath53 if @xmath69 otherwise @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath54 , ( ) .",
    "scale - free network results were similar .",
    "[ fig : sir_time_course ] ]    figure [ fig : ar_cross_sections ] depicts the attack ratio as a function of @xmath56 for various values of the recovery rate parameter @xmath55 .",
    "interestingly , without a caretaker effect ( @xmath38 ) the increase in attack ration is not substantial as @xmath56 is increased . for @xmath48 , we observe a decrease in attack ratio even for small fractions of caretaker links .",
    "the minimum attack ratio is attained only in a regime where most links are caretaker links .",
    "figure [ fig : attack_rate_phase ] depicts the attack ratio as a function of both system parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 and compares the behavior in both network architectures , and .",
    "in contrast with the sir system , network topology does not substantially change the dynamics , both networks exhibit a similar attack ratio as a function of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "for fixed @xmath55 increasing @xmath56 first decreases the attack ratio until a minimum is attained .",
    "increasing @xmath56 further increases the attack ratio again . a consistent effect",
    "is observed in the response of the epidemic peak to changes in @xmath55 and @xmath56 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : epidemic_peak ] .     as a function of @xmath12 for sir dynamics with various values of @xmath24 in an network . for each @xmath72 ,",
    "the attack rate is minimized for some value of @xmath12 between @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as @xmath24 increases , this minimum point shifts subtly to the right .",
    "this shows that the more effective caretakers are at healing , the more caretaker relationships the system can permit before they have a negative impact on the attack rate .",
    "the plots correspond to @xmath66 , @xmath42 , @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath75 , @xmath68 , @xmath53 if @xmath69 otherwise @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig : ar_cross_sections ] ]         the dynamics seen above for the attack rate are mirrored in the epidemic peak @xmath76 as well ( fig .",
    "[ fig : epidemic_peak ] ) , which decreases as caretaker effectiveness ( represented by @xmath24 ) increases .",
    "there is again a critical relationship with @xmath12 , as values of @xmath77 tend to minimize the epidemic peak for @xmath72 .",
    "again though , for @xmath78 , increasing @xmath12 yields a monotonic increase in @xmath76 .",
    "individual response can have a great impact on the dynamics of spreading diseases on complex networks .",
    "in particular , if one uses an avoidance strategy whereby all individuals simply avoid infecteds , the endemic state of an sis disease can be drastically reduced . on the other hand , allowing individuals ( caretakers ) to become closer to infecteds is a calculated risk .",
    "if the caretakers are not effective healers ( such as non - physician parents and children ) , then the severity of the disease generally increases .",
    "but if the caretakers are effective healers ( consider doctor / patient relationships , for example ) , then the outcome of the disease is generally improved even by a small number of them .",
    "if too many caretakers are introduced , though , their healing benefit is overridden by their increased exposure , yielding a worse outcome than if the population had simply not reacted .",
    "these findings have a number of implications in public health .",
    "for one , in a large - scale epidemic there certainly exists a critical fraction of doctors and aid workers in the population . if there are too few or too many , they can actually _ increase _ the total number of individuals infected over the course of the disease . in such cases , it would actually be more beneficial to employ an avoidance strategy whereby all individuals , including doctors and aid workers , simply avoided infected individuals . in the particular case of @xmath79 endemic diseases , we have seen that the critical caretaker proportion is actually @xmath65 on scale - free networks .",
    "this suggests that networks that exhibit a strong variability in interaction statistics and at the same time are adaptive , are less susceptible to the risk of endemic diseases , and the natural instinct to avoid infection is more effective in eliminating a disease than the positive effects that caretakers may have .",
