    "in this paper , we aim at combining and using ideas from one area of mathematics ( operator theory and traditional analysis ) in a different area ( martingale theory from probability ) .",
    "we have in mind applications to both wavelets and symbolic dynamics .",
    "so our paper is interdisciplinary : results in one area often benefit the other .",
    "in fact , the benefits go both ways .",
    "our construction is based on a closer examination of an eigenvalue problem for a transition operator , also called a perron - frobenius - ruelle operator .    under suitable conditions on the given filter functions ,",
    "our construction takes place in the hilbert space @xmath2 . in a variety of examples , for example for frequency",
    "localized wavelets , more general filter functions are called for .",
    "this then entails basis constructions in hilbert spaces of @xmath3-martingales .",
    "these martingale hilbert spaces consist of @xmath3 functions on certain projective limit spaces @xmath4 built on a given mapping @xmath5 which is onto , and finite - to - one .",
    "we study function theory on @xmath4 in a suitable general framework , as suggested by applications ; and we develop our theory in the context of hilbert space and operator theory .",
    "we hope that these perhaps unexpected links between more traditional and narrowly defined fields will inspire further research .",
    "since we wish to reach several audiences , we have included here a few more details than is perhaps standard in more specialized papers .",
    "the general question we address already has a number of incarnations in the literature , but they have so far not been unified . here",
    "are two such examples which capture the essence of our focus .",
    "( a )  extension of non - invertible endomorphisms in one space @xmath1 to automorphisms in a bigger space naturally containing @xmath1 .",
    "( b )  some non - invertible operator @xmath6 ( contractive or isometric ) in a fixed hilbert space @xmath7 is given .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath6 is contractive and that it satisfies a certain covariance condition specified by a system of operators in @xmath7 .",
    "the question is then to extend @xmath6 to a unitary operator @xmath8 in a bigger hilbert space which naturally contains @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 satisfies a covariance condition arising by dilation from the initially given system on @xmath7 .",
    "the dilation idea in operator theory is fundamental ; i.e. , the idea of extending ( or dilating ) an operator system on a fixed hilbert space @xmath9 to a bigger ambient hilbert space @xmath10 in such a way as to get orthogonality relations in the dilated space @xmath10 ; see for example @xcite and remark [ rem3_2 ] below . in an operator algebraic framework",
    "such an extension is of course encoded by stinespring s theorem @xcite .",
    "our present setting is motivated by this , but goes beyond it in a number of ways , as we show in sections [ prolim][ite ] below .",
    "our basic viewpoint may be understood from the example of wavelets : a crucial strength of wavelet bases is their algorithmic and computational features .",
    "what this means in terms of the two hilbert spaces are three things : first we must have a concrete function representation of the dilated space @xmath10 ; and secondly we aim for recursive and matrix based algorithms , much like the familiar case of gram - schmidt algorithms which lets us compute orthonormal bases , or frames ( see e.g. , @xcite ) in the dilated space @xmath10 .",
    "thirdly , we reverse the traditional point of view .",
    "hence , the dilation idea is turned around : starting with @xmath10 , we wish to select a subspace @xmath9 which is computationally much more feasible .",
    "this idea is motivated by image processing where such a selected subspace @xmath9 corresponds to a chosen resolution , and where `` resolution '' is to be understood in the sense of optics ; see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the selection of subspace @xmath9 is made in such a way as to yield recursive algorithms to be used in computation of orthonormal bases , or frames in @xmath10 , but starting with data from @xmath9 .",
    "examples of ( a ) occur in thermodynamics , such as it is presented in its rigorous form by david ruelle in @xcite and @xcite . both ( a ) and ( b ) are present in the approach to wavelets that goes under the name multiresolution analysis ( mra ) @xcite . in this case",
    ", we can take @xmath1 to be @xmath11 , or equivalently the circle , or the unit - interval @xmath12 , and the extension of @xmath1 can be taken to be the real line @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) , or it may be a suitable solenoid over @xmath1 ; see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . in this case , the endomorphism in @xmath1 is multiplication by @xmath14 modulo the integers @xmath15 , and the extension to @xmath13 is simply @xmath16 .",
    "the more traditional settings for ( b ) are scattering theory @xcite or the theory of extensions , or unitary dilations of operators in hilbert space , as presented for example in @xcite , @xcite , and in the references given there .    specifically , we study the problem of inducing operators on hilbert space from non - invertible transformations on compact metric spaces .",
    "the operators , or representations must satisfy relations which mirror properties of the given point transformations .    while our setup allows a rather general formulation in the context of @xmath17-algebras",
    ", we will emphasize the case of induction from an abelian @xmath17-algebra .",
    "hence , we will stress the special case when @xmath1 is a given compact metric space , and @xmath18 is a finite - to - one mapping of @xmath1 onto @xmath1 .",
    "several of our results are in the measurable category ; and in particular we are not assuming continuity of @xmath0 , or any contractivity properties .",
    "our results will apply to wavelets .",
    "in the theory of multiresolution wavelets , the problem is to construct a special basis in the hilbert space @xmath2 from a set of numbers @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the starting point is the scaling identity @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a @xmath23 by @xmath23 matrix over @xmath24 , with eigenvalues @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , and where @xmath27 is a function in @xmath2 .",
    "the first problem is to determine when ( [ eqintsc1 ] ) has a solution in @xmath2 , and to establish how these solutions ( _ scaling functions _ ) depend on the coefficients @xmath19 .",
    "when the fourier transform is applied , we get the equivalent formulation , @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the fourier transform , @xmath30 and where now @xmath31 is a function on the torus @xmath32 the duality between the compact group @xmath33 and the lattice @xmath34 is given by @xmath35    in this case , matrix multiplication @xmath36 on @xmath37 passes to the quotient @xmath38 , and we get an @xmath39-to - one mapping @xmath40 , which we denote by @xmath41 .",
    "the function @xmath31 is called a low pass filter , and it is chosen such that the operator @xmath42 given by @xmath43 is an isometry on @xmath44 . moreover ,",
    "@xmath45 acts as multiplication operators on @xmath9 . if @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 a main problem is the extension of this covariance relation ( [ eqintcov1 ] ) to a bigger hilbert space @xmath49 , @xmath50 , such that @xmath51 is unitary in @xmath52 .",
    "we now sketch briefly this extension in some concrete cases of interest .    in section [ prolim ]",
    ", we construct a sequence of measures @xmath53 on @xmath33 such that @xmath54 , and such that there are natural isometric embeddings @xmath55 the limit in ( [ eqint3 ] ) defines a _ martingale hilbert space _ @xmath7 in such a way that the norm of the @xmath3-martingale @xmath56 is @xmath57 we also state a pointwise a.e .",
    "convergence result ( section [ mar ] ) .",
    "if @xmath58 is defined by @xmath59 then @xmath60 is an isometry of @xmath61 into @xmath2 .",
    "specifically @xmath62 as a result we have induced a system @xmath63 where @xmath64 @xmath65 unitary ; the system is determined by the given filter function @xmath31 .",
    "it can be checked ( see details in section [ mar ] ) that @xmath60 is an isometry , and that @xmath66 holds on @xmath2 .",
    "moreover @xmath60 maps onto @xmath2 if the function @xmath31 does nt vanish on a subset of positive measure .    in the case of wavelets , we ask for a wavelet basis in @xmath2 which is consistent with a suitable resolution subspace in @xmath2 .",
    "whether the basis is orthonormal , or just a parseval frame , it may be constructed from a system of subband filters @xmath67 , say with @xmath39 frequency bands .",
    "these filters @xmath67 may be realized as functions on @xmath68 , the @xmath23-torus .",
    "typically the scaling operation is specified by a given expansive integral @xmath23 by @xmath23 matrix @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath69 .",
    "pass @xmath22 to the quotient @xmath1 = @xmath38 , and we get a mapping @xmath0 of @xmath1 onto @xmath1 such that @xmath70 for all @xmath71 in @xmath1 , and the @xmath39 branches of the inverse are strictly contractive in @xmath72 if the eigenvalues of @xmath22 satisfy @xmath73 .    the subband filters @xmath67 are defined in terms of this map , @xmath41 , and the problem is now to realize the wavelet data in the hilbert space @xmath2 in such a way that @xmath74 induces the unitary scaling operator @xmath75 in @xmath2 , see ( [ eqintdil ] ) .      in this paper",
    "we will show that this extension from spaces @xmath1 , with a finite - to - one mapping @xmath18 , to operator systems may be done quite generally , to apply to the case when @xmath1 is a julia set for a fixed rational function of a complex variable , i.e. , @xmath76 , with @xmath77 polynomials , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "then @xmath80 is @xmath39-to-@xmath81 except at the singular points of @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath82 denotes the julia set of @xmath0 .",
    "it also applies to shift invariant spaces @xmath83 when @xmath22 is a @xmath84 matrix , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the familiar subshift .",
    "note that @xmath87 is onto iff every column in @xmath22 contains at least one entry @xmath81 .",
    "part of the motivation for our paper derives from the papers by richard gundy @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second named author also acknowledges enlightening discussions with r. gundy .",
    "the fundamental idea in these papers by gundy et al is that multiresolutions should be understood as martingales in the sense of doob @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and neveu @xcite . and",
    "moreover that this is a natural viewpoint .",
    "one substantial advantage of this viewpoint is that we are then able to handle the construction of wavelets from subband filters that are only assumed measurable , i.e. , filters that fail to satisfy the regularity conditions that are traditionally imposed in wavelet analysis .",
    "a second advantage is that the martingale approach applies to a number of wavelet - like constructions completely outside the traditional scope of wavelet analysis in the hilbert space @xmath2 . but more importantly",
    ", the martingale tools apply even when the operation of scaling does nt take place in @xmath37 at all , but rather in a compact julia set from complex dynamics ; or the scaling operation may be one of the shift in the subshift dynamics that is understood from that thermodynamical formalism of david ruelle @xcite .",
    "in each of the examples , we are faced with a given space @xmath1 , and a finite - to - one mapping @xmath18 .",
    "the space @xmath1 is equipped with a suitable family of measures @xmath88 , and the @xmath89 functions on @xmath1 act by multiplication on the corresponding @xmath3 spaces , @xmath90 .",
    "it is easy to see that there are @xmath3 isometries which intertwine the multiplication operators @xmath91 and @xmath92 , as @xmath93 ranges over @xmath94 .",
    "we have @xmath95 where the vertical maps are given by inclusions .",
    "specifically , @xmath96    but for spectral theoretic calculations , we need to have representations of @xmath91 and @xmath92 unitarily equivalent .",
    "that is true in traditional wavelet applications , but the unitary operator @xmath8 in ( [ eqintadd2 ] ) is not acting on @xmath90 .",
    "rather , the unitary @xmath8 is acting by matrix scaling on a different hilbert space , namely + @xmath97 , @xmath98    in the other applications , julia set , and shift - spaces , we aim for a similar construction .",
    "but in these other cases , it is not at all clear what the hilbert space corresponding to @xmath2 , and the corresponding unitary matrix scaling operator , should be .",
    "we provide two answers to this question , one at an abstract level , and a second one which is a concrete function representation ; sections [ mul ] and [ prolim ] .    at the abstract level",
    ", we show that the construction may be accomplished in hilbert spaces which serve as unitary dilations of the initial structure , see ( [ eqintadd1 ] ) .    in the concrete",
    ", we show that the extended hilbert spaces may be taken as hilbert spaces of @xmath3- martingales on @xmath1 . in fact",
    ", we present these as hilbert spaces of @xmath3 functions built from a projective limit @xmath99 this is analogous to the distinction between an abstract spectral theorem on the one hand , and a concrete spectral representation , on the other .",
    "to know details about multiplicities , and multiplicity functions ( section [ mul ] ) , we need the latter .",
