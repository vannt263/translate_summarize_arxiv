    "recently a novel type of faint supernovae ( sne ) with peculiar properties has been discovered .",
    "a group of eight such events has been identified , all spectroscopically similar to type ib sne , but faint ( typical absolute peak magnitude of @xmath2 ) and calcium rich @xcite . although type ib sne are generally thought to result from core - collapse of massive stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , a large fraction of the host galaxies of these faint , ca - rich sne are early type galaxies .",
    "additionally , the ejecta mass of sne in this subclass appear to be very low ( e.g. @xmath3 found for sn 2005e , @xcite ; and @xmath4 found for sn 2005cz , @xcite ) , less than expected and observed for core - collapse sne of any type .",
    "these sne were therefore suggested to originate from a different process involving the thermonuclear explosion of a helium - shell on a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an alternative scenario involving a core - collapse of a @xmath0 star , which is a part of a binary , was suggested by @xcite for the origin of one of the ca - rich sne ; sn 2005cz . here",
    "we study this possibility , and look for any evidence for sf or young stellar population near the location of sn 2005cz . in the following",
    "we discuss our results from observations of various sf tracers including @xmath1 emission , hst photometry , host galaxy spectra and uv emission .",
    "in addition we shortly discuss the star formation and merger history of the host galaxy .",
    "massive stars are usually formed and observed in giant molecular clouds and young stellar clusters or associations @xcite .",
    "core - collapse sne from massive stars are therefore expected to be found close to star - forming regions ( sfrs ) , and overall in sf galaxies .",
    "we therefore searched for sf tracers in the host galaxy both near and far from the location of sn 2005cz .",
    "sfrs produce two classes of emission : continuum emission from young stars and emission lines ( dominated by h@xmath5 ) produced by ionized gas .",
    "we have searched for both classes of emission , and obtained upper limits on the sf rates .",
    "in addition we used hst images to look for nearby point sources which may correspond to young stars close to the sn location .",
    "sn 2005cz was discovered on july 17th 2005 , in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4589 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ra 12:37:27.85 ; dec 74:11:24.5 ) . published",
    "narrow - band imaging data exists for this galaxy @xcite .",
    "these data do not suggest any sf activity close to the location of sn 2005cz , although @xcite do find a significant h@xmath5+[nii ] emission from the central regions of the galaxy , aligned along the minor axis where a dust lane is observed ( see fig . 1 and their fig . 22 ) .",
    "we obtained an additional h@xmath5 image of ngc 4589 with the liverpool telescope ( lt ) , and then analyzed it using similar methods to those described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we detected the dust lane mentioned above as a perturbation to the isophotes in our lt r - band image .",
    "notice that according to @xcite the h@xmath5+[nii ] emission is associated with the liner nucleus , and sf is not discussed in that context ; this is further supported by @xcite and our analysis of the galaxy spectrum ( see below and in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - nucleus - subtracted ] ) .",
    "moreover , the emission runs from the galactic nucleus along an axis offset to that containing the sn 2005cz position .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence in either the @xcite data or in ours for any line emission near the sn location and even to large distances from it ( > 1.5 kpc , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : the - nucleus - subtracted ] ) .",
    "although core - collapse sne do not locally trace the h@xmath5 emission from sf regions , they do trace larger scale sf h@xmath5 emission in the host galaxies of core - collapse sne @xcite .",
    "in particular , none of the @xmath6 sne in the @xcite sample were found in elliptical galaxies , and only @xmath7 of all cc sne in their survey show h@xmath5 emission at similar or larger distances from the sne location as found for sn 2005cz .",
    "we note that in the latter cases the emission was clearly related to sf , where as the h@xmath5 emission we find in the host galaxy of sn 2005cz ( but far from it ) is likely related to the liner nucleus , rather than to any sf activity ( see next section ) .",
    "we also used our data to determine a @xmath8 upper limit for the h@xmath5 flux from the variation of the sky background , using a @xmath9 aperture , of @xmath10 erg @xmath11 ( determined using a host galaxy r - band magnitude taken from @xcite ) . at the distance of ngc 4589 ( @xmath12 mpc ; taken from ned )",
    "this corresponds to an h@xmath5 luminosity of @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 . correcting this for galactic extinction ( 0.075 ) and the contribution from nii lines we get an h@xmath5 flux of @xmath15 erg s@xmath14 @xmath11 . using the calibration from ( * ? ? ?",

    "we observed the location of sn 2005cz on 28 july , 2005 using the lris spectrograph mounted on the keck 10 m telescope on 28 july , 2005 , and obtained data from a 500 s exposure .",
    "the deep , 2-d spectral image shows no emission features within at least 1 kpc of the location of sn 2005cz ( see fig .",

    "thus , while h@xmath5 emission is observed in the galaxy , it is not near the sn location , and in any event shows no obvious indication of being associated with sf activity .",

    "the relative strengths of the emission lines are consistent with the liner classification given by @xcite for the nucleus of ngc  4589 , and the lack of perceptible h@xmath5 emission close to the location of sn 2005cz in this deep spectral image is consistent with the absence of any other indicator of ongoing sf activity in the galaxy . ]",

    "massive stars usually have similarly high mass companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore initially attempted to find a detection of the ( likely ) massive companion of the sn progenitor in the post - explosion data , but no point source was visible at the sn site .",

    "in this case we find detection limits of @xmath38 and @xmath39 where again the the errors are dominated by the uncertainty in the distance modulus .",

    "the hst images show no evidence of red supergiants more massive than @xmath47 in the vicinity of the sn location .",
    "if the progenitor of sn 2005cz was a @xmath0 star ( lifetimes of @xmath48 myr ; @xcite 1992 ) , we might still have been able to find more massive stars ( e.g. 15 @xmath49 , with lifetime of @xmath50 myr ) , given a few myr age spread inferred for sf regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we conclude that the hst data constrain the possibility of recent sf activity , and disfavor a very massive stellar progenitor for sn 2005cz ( i.e. likely excluding the possibility of a single massive progenitor , as suggested in some models for type ib sn ) .",
    "they also exclude the existence of a massive ( @xmath51 ) red supergiant binary companion to the progenitor of sn 2005cz .",
    "however , these data can not , by themselves , strongly constrain a core - collapse model with a @xmath0 progenitor for the sn .",
    "we use host galaxy photometry compiled in a similar way to that described by @xcite , including ultraviolet data from the galex ( galaxy evolution explorer ) satellite , and optical photometry from the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; @xcite ) and 2mass @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the data in order to estimate the sf history and age of ngc 4589 using the methods described in detail by @xcite .",

    "the best fit parameters are a total stellar mass of @xmath52 , _ null _ specific sf rate , and mean age of @xmath54 gyr . ]",
    "we have estimated a limit on the sf rate near the sn location using the measured nuv luminosity .",
    "we have relied on the relation from @xcite converted to the @xcite imf:@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the nuv luminosity in units of ergs s@xmath14 hz@xmath14 , and sfr is the sf rate in @xmath49 yr@xmath14 .",
    "we note that sfrs derived from the nuv luminosity for red sequence galaxies are problematic ( see discussion in @xcite ) , because the nuv band can include light from older stellar populations @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the nuv luminosity will overestimate the recent sfr .",
    "the sfr we find therefore serves only as an upper limit . for an aperture of @xmath57 kpc around the sn location",
    "we find the galactic extinction corrected ab nuv magnitude of @xmath58 mag . at the distance of ngc 4589 this translates to @xmath59 yr@xmath14 . at such low sfr ,",
    "massive stars are unlikely to form . indeed , as discussed by @xcite , the upper limit for the stellar clusters mass function decreases with lower sfr .",
    "the fraction of ionizing massive stars is higher in heavy star clusters than in light star clusters , due to the relation between the mass of a star cluster and its most massive star .",
    "therefore ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 4 ) find that at sfrs as low as we find , massive stars of @xmath60 as required for a core - collapse sn , rarely form , if they form at all .",
    "in support of one of the model in which sn 2005cz originated from a core collapse of a young massive star ( @xmath0 ) , @xcite suggest that ngc 4589 could have suffered a recent merger , triggering some sf activity . however , the morphology of ngc 4589 is relaxed @xcite .",
    "even the dust lane mentioned above is observed at a very low level , and therefore a major merger occurring 100 myr ago or less is unlikely .",
    "although ngc 4589 does have a complex stellar rotation field , its morphology shows a smooth optical profile following the de vaucouleurs law @xcite ; this could support the possibility that the galaxy is a relatively old merger remnant ; however , this is irrelevant for the discussion of recently triggered sf . moreover , even if a minor merger event occurred in the more recent past , the evidence from the dust lane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r - band ] ) would suggest that it occurred along the minor axis , far from the sn location .",
    "in this letter we studied the local and global environment of sn 2005cz in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4589 .",
    "we used various sf tracers including optical spectroscopy , @xmath1 emission , uv emission and hst photometry .",
    "we also reviewed the the merger history of the host galaxy .",
    "we found that although some h@xmath5 emission ( which in principle could trace sf activity ) exists in the host galaxy , it is far ( > 1.5 kpc away ) from , and unrelated to the close environment of sn 2005cz .",
    "moreover , this emission is more likely to be associated with an agn in the nucleus , rather than trace sf activity .",
    "other star formation tracers ( hst imaging of young massive stars , uv , r - band imaging and host galaxy spectrum ) show no evidence for sf in the galaxy , and particularly close to the reported location of the sn .",
    "the uv emission data could trace stars down to lower mass than h@xmath5 emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , while h@xmath5 emission may not be detected in older sf regions , in which core - collapse sne from progenitors of @xmath0 may explode , they should still present significant uv emission .",
    "the lack of such uv emission therefore suggests that recent sf activity has not occurred in this galaxy , and in particular close to the location of sn 2005cz .",
    "in addition , the overall structure and colors of the host galaxy show no evidence of recent sf in the last gyr .",
    "the hst data exclude very massive progenitors , suggested to be the progenitors of type ib sne , and show no evidence for massive young clusters or @xmath61 supergiants near the sn location .    in principle",
    ", a massive progenitor could have formed far from the observed sn location , and later have been ejected at high velocity to explode far from its birth place .",
    "since we find no evidence for sf even up to 1 kpc from the sn location , such a star should have been a runaway star to form so far ( velocities of 30 - 100 km s@xmath14 , for a lifetime of 10 - 40 myr ) . according to @xcite the progenitor",
    "is suggested to be a binary star .",
    "however , runaway ( or hypervelocity ) binary stars , especially massive ones as required for a sn progenitor , are rare @xcite . therefore , although possible in principle , such a scenario would require fine tuned conditions .",
    "taken together , the analysis of uv and h@xmath5 emission , the spectrum of the host galaxy ngc 4589 , the 2mass and rcs photometry as well as out hst data , show no evidence for recent sf near the location of sn 2005cz or even at large distances from it .",
    "we conclude that our results strongly disfavor a young massive - star progenitor for sn 2005cz .",
    "these results are consistent with the host galaxy type of other ca - rich faint type ib sne , found to be biased towards early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , the only sne of types ii or ib / c ever to be found in elliptical galaxies ( sne 2000ds and 2005cz ) are both faint ca - rich type ib sne similar to sn 2005e @xcite .",
