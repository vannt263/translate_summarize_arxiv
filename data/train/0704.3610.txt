    "the mechanism of high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductivity has been attracting much interest since it is discovered in 1986  @xcite . in cuprate superconductors , electrons ( or holes ) in the cuo@xmath2 planes play major roles , and the importance of the coulomb repulsion at the cu - sites is emphasized from the beginning  @xcite . however , theoretical understanding of its effects on the superconductivity is still limited and is being a challenging problem in condensed matter physics .",
    "most theories which start with viewing cuprate superconductors as doped mott insulators are based on the so - called zhang - rice singlet states  @xcite . in the undoped case , where there is one hole per cu - site in cuo@xmath2 planes , the cuprates exhibit insulating antiferromagnetism due to the strong coulomb repulsion at the cu - sites . when the system is doped , additional holes are created on the o - sites . because of a superexchange antiferromagnetic interaction , each of the holes occupies a quasi - localized state on the four nearest neighbour o - sites around a cu - site , forming a local spin - singlet with the hole on the central cu - site .",
    "this singlet is now referred to as zhang - rice singlet .",
    "the zhang - rice singlets become charge carriers moving through the cuo@xmath2 plane and condense into a superconducting state .",
    "this scenario is usually examined by using the @xmath3-@xmath4 model  which is a single - band effective hamiltonian with antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbour holes on the cu - sites  @xcite . despite its simple form ,",
    "however , it is a formidably difficult task to rigorously analyze the @xmath3-@xmath4 model , and whether the model really describes the cuprate superconductivity has not yet been clarified . in the current situation , we think that a rigorous establishment of occurrence of a superconducting state based on the zhang - rice singlets in a model with the coulomb repulsion and antiferromagnetic interactions , even if it is apart from the @xmath3-@xmath4 model , certainly gives us an important step toward understanding of the cuprates superconductivity .    in this paper",
    ", we study a simple @xmath0-wave pairing state expanded in terms of the zhang - rice singlet states .",
    "it is shown that the pairing state is regarded as a condensed state of the zhang - rice singlets in the background of a resonating - valence - bond state consisting of holes at the cu - sites .",
    "we estimate an upper bound on an off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) parameter with @xmath0-wave symmetry for the pairing state as a function of doping concentration @xmath5 .",
    "it is found that an upper bound has a dome structure with a maximum at @xmath6 and becomes zero at @xmath7 .",
    "we also estimate a lower bound on the odlro parameter and show that odlro exists for sufficiently large doping concentrations .",
    "we then introduce a model with on - site repulsion and kinds of antiferromagnetic interactions , and show that the pairing state is a ground state of this model . a related model with infinitely large on - site repulsion at the cu - site",
    "is analyzed in ref .",
    "this model , however , has following disadvantages : the hamiltonian does not have spin rotational symmetry , and its exact pairing ground state has less relevance to the zhang - rice singlets .",
    "although the present model has still somewhat artificial aspects , it is for the first time that the pairing state with @xmath0-wave symmetry which is written explicitly in terms of the zhang - rice singlet states is realized as a ground state of the concrete hamiltonian .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we prepare some notation and give a definition of the zhang - rice singlet states . in section  [ sc : pairing state ] , we introduce a two - electron state with @xmath0-wave symmetry , and , on the basis of the zhang - rice singlet states , we construct a pairing state in which many electrons condense into this two - electron state . in section  [ sc : order parameter ] , we discuss an expectation value of an order parameter with @xmath0-wave symmetry for the pairing state .",
    "an upper bound for the order parameter is obtained in this section and a lower bound , whose estimation needs somewhat technical calculations , is obtained in section  [ sc : lower bound ] . in section  [ sc : hamiltonian ]",
    "we introduce a hamiltonian whose ground state is the pairing state which we construct . in the final section , a summary and some remarks are given . in appendix",
    "[ a : non - vanishing ] we show that the pairing state is non - vanishing .",

    "we define @xmath13 which is the collection of the mid - points of the nearest neighbour bonds in @xmath14 and corresponds to the o - sites .",

    "we introduce further the following sublattices of @xmath14 : @xmath17        next we introduce fermion operators which annihilate or create _ holes _ with spin @xmath18 at sites in @xmath16 .",
    "any states with the number @xmath19 of holes can be constructed by operating these operators on a state @xmath20 with no holes on @xmath16 . by @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "we denote the annihilation(creation ) operators of holes at @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , each hole additionally induced in a cuo@xmath2 plane with 1 hole per cu is considered to localize well at the four nearest o - sites of a cu - site because of the antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions between cu- and o - sites . to describe this localized state on the o - sites we introduce the following operators for each @xmath23  @xcite : @xmath25 as is easily seen , the annihilation operator @xmath26 and the creation operator @xmath27 defined by ( [ eq : fxs ] ) do not anticommute when @xmath28 , implying that the single - electron states corresponding to ( [ eq : fxs ] ) are not orthogonal . to avoid technical complexities arising from this fact , we consider corresponding wannier states .",
    "to do so , we introduce the fermion operator @xmath29 and the reciprocal lattice @xmath30 and then define @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we normalize the @xmath34-operators as @xmath35 , where the normalization factors are given by @xmath36 the fermion operators corresponding to the wannier states are defined by @xmath37 the @xmath38-operators defined as above approximate the @xmath39-operators well , and satisfy the canonical fermion anticommutation relations @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the rest of this paper , we consider the zhang - rice singlets by using the @xmath38-operators , instead of the @xmath39-operators .",

    "any @xmath48-hole state is then expressed by a linear combination of @xmath49 with @xmath50 ( fig .",

    "we furthermore assume that @xmath51 holes added in this state form zhang - rice singlets . then a @xmath52-hole state with @xmath53 is written by using a set of states @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a subset of @xmath14 with @xmath56 and",

    "this hamiltonian or more generally the @xmath0-@xmath145 hamiltonian with @xmath175 may be able to reproduce the essential features of high-@xmath1 cuprates , such as antiferromagnetism at low doping concentrations and charge density order ( or a stripe structure ) between the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting states .",
    "we believe that further investigations about modified models based on our hamiltonian which is now shown to exhibit odrlo with @xmath0-wave symmetry will contribute the understanding of high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductivity . + * acknowledgements * + i would like to thank masanori yamanaka for useful discussions about related topics .",

    "in this appendix we shall show that the pairing state @xmath85 is non - vanishing when the number of holes , @xmath80 , satisfies @xmath276 with some integer @xmath277 .",
    "a similar argument will show that @xmath85 is non - vanishing for @xmath278 .",
    "it is easy to see that the collection of the states in the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : phig - expansion ] ) is orthogonal .",
    "so @xmath85 is non - vanishing if one of those terms is non - vanishing .",
    "we shall show that this is the case .",
    "let @xmath279 and @xmath280 now we pick up the state in ( [ eq : phig - expansion ] ) corresponding to the subset @xmath281 .",
    "substituting @xmath282 into this state , we obtain @xmath283 the collection of the states in the right - hand - side of the above expression is again orthogonal .",
    "let @xmath284 .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath285 is non - zero .",
    "this implies that the term in ( [ eq : phig - expansion2 ] ) with @xmath286 ( and thus the term with @xmath287 in ( [ eq : phig - expansion2 ] ) ) is non - vanishing , which concludes that @xmath85 is non - vanishing ."
