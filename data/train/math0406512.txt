    "any triple of one of the forms , is a ppt .    in some of the papers where this was discussed ,",
    "the theorem has been described as placing the ppts @xmath1 with @xmath6 odd and @xmath7 even on the nodes of an infinite rooted ternary tree , with the root representing the `` basic '' triple @xmath12 , and where each triple @xmath1 has three children , representing the multiplication of the triple ( considered as a column vector ) by the three matrices @xmath13 . in this paper",
