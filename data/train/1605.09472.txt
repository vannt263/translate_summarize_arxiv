    "the observation of quantum phenomena in the macroscopic world is commonly a hard task , as the quantum - to - classical transition ( qct ) is expected in the limit of large excitation numbers and many - body systems @xcite .",
    "the origin for such a transition has been related to decoherence due to interaction with an environment @xcite , unattainability of superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states @xcite , and imprecise measurements @xcite . furthermore , the qct may depend on how a system is monitored , since the dynamics of a quantum system is usually disturbed by a meter @xcite .",
    "a two - level system is often employed to monitor the properties of cavity fields @xcite .",
    "for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite the qct of a cavity mode was investigated by raising its average number of photons , @xmath0 , so that a classical behavior for the cavity transmission @xcite and the normalized second order correlation function @xcite were observed in the limit of the macroscopic field ( @xmath2 ) , as expected .",
    "recently , we also investigated the qct by raising @xmath0 either coherently ( coherent driving field ) or incoherently ( temperature ) @xcite .",
    "we showed theoretically that the nonclassical behavior of a cavity field can be revealed even when @xmath2 , regime in which the statistical properties of the cavity field can be classically described @xcite . to do that , a pair of identical two - level atoms sufficiently far from each other , to be considered noninteracting systems , was employed to monitor the field behavior instead of a single one , i.e.",
    ", the whole atomic system was used as a detector for the field behavior .    a classical theory describing such a field is not able to explain the generation of any kind of correlations between the noninteracting atoms , since classical fields perform only local operations on them @xcite .",
    "thus , given the atomic system initially in a separable state , if the steady atomic state is ( quantum or classically ) correlated , the field is nonclassical .",
    "although there is no steady entanglement , our previous results revealed that there are steady correlations between the atoms ( classical correlations @xcite , quantum discord @xcite and , consequently , mutual information @xcite ) even when @xmath2 , i.e. , the quantum character of the field is still there even for a macroscopic field @xcite . as in @xcite , we neglected the atomic decay since the atoms act as a meter to monitor the behavior of the cavity mode , i.e. , an ideal detector was assumed .    whereas long relaxation times are desired to avoid decoherence in quantum information processing @xcite , short ones are also an object of interest when dissipative processes are engineered for preparing an specific steady state @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the system dynamics provides us the time scales in which the system evolves unitarily and then reaches its steady state . in this sense , because system behavior has only been analyzed in the stationary regime in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we extend such results by investigating the long - times dynamics of that driven - dissipative open quantum system , showing that the interplay between driving agents , dissipation and internal interaction can substantially modify the relaxation times of the system .",
    "moreover , we also show how the atomic spontaneous emission ( real detector ) affects the previous results .",
    "therefore , our theoretical study presented here provides valuable and relevant information to perform an experimental demonstration of the quantumness of an intense cavity field , as well as to implement theoretical proposals based on the same driven - dissipative open quantum system , such as the generation of werner - like stationary states @xcite and subradiant entangled states @xcite .    in order to investigate the relaxation time of the system , we study the scaling of the spectral gap of the liouvillian @xcite with the driving agents , dissipation and internal interaction",
    "we show that , while the relaxation time of the system varies proportionally to @xmath0 for a coherent driving , it varies inversely proportionally to @xmath0 for an incoherent pumping ( i.e. , by increasing the reservoir temperature ) .",
    "thus , the time required to observe the manifestation of the quantum aspects of a cavity field on the atomic correlations diverges as @xmath0 tends to macroscopic values due to coherent driving . on the other hand",
    ", this time goes to zero for incoherent pumping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii outlines the model describing the dynamics of the driven - dissipative open quantum system . in sec .",
    "iii , the concepts of spectral gap and relaxation time are introduced via the liouvillian spectrum .",
    "section iv includes our investigation of the spectral gap involving an intense cavity field generated either coherently or incoherently .",
    "the effects of small atomic spontaneous emission are presented in sec .",
    "v. finally , sec .",
    "vi covers the summary of the results .",
    "the system comprises a driven cavity mode interacting resonantly with a pair of identical noninteracting two - level atoms ( @xmath3 =  ground state , @xmath4 = excited state ) , with coupling strength @xmath5 .",
    "the total hamiltonian which describes this system in the interaction picture is ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the interaction part of the tavis ",
    "cummings hamiltonian @xcite , and @xmath9 describes a driving field pumping the cavity mode with strength @xmath10 .",
    "the operators @xmath11 are the collective spin operators with @xmath12 , in which @xmath13 are the pauli operators for each atom .",
    "the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity field is indicated by @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that each part of the system is locally coupled to a bosonic thermal bath , which is valid when the atom - field coupling @xmath5 is much smaller than the bare frequencies of the cavity mode and the atomic transition . under the born - markov approximation ,",
    "the dynamics is given by the following lindblad master equation @xcite @xmath16 + \\kappa ( n_{\\text{th}}+1 )   \\mathcal{d}[a ] \\rho + \\kappa n_{\\text{th}}\\mathcal{d}[a^{\\dag } ] \\rho \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\gamma } { 2}(n_{\\text{th}}+1 ) { \\sum\\nolimits_{j}}% \\mathcal{d}[\\sigma _ { -}^{j } ] \\rho + \\frac{\\gamma } { 2}n_{\\text{th}}% { \\sum\\nolimits_{j}}\\mathcal{d}[\\sigma _ { + } ^{j } ] \\rho ,     \\label{eqmestraint}\\end{aligned}\\]]in which @xmath17 is the average number of thermal photons , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the dissipation rates of the cavity mode and the atoms , respectively , and @xmath20 \\rho = ( 2\\mathcal{o}\\rho \\mathcal{o}^{\\dag } -\\mathcal{o}^{\\dag } \\mathcal{o}\\rho -\\rho \\mathcal{o}^{\\dag } \\mathcal{o } ) $ ] .    by solving this equation it is possible to observe the time the system takes to reach the steady state , for instance .",
    "this relaxation time of the system can also be obtained by analyzing the liouvillian spectrum : the eigenvalue of the liouvillian with the smallest nonzero absolute real part determines the relaxation time , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "the calculation of this spectrum for the general case is possible only numerically , allowing analytical solution in some particular cases .",
    "fortunately , one of these cases is for large @xmath0 and small atom - field couplings ( @xmath21 ) , which is our main case of interest here .",
    "equation ( [ eqmestraint ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath22 in which @xmath23  denotes the total liouville operator ( or liouvillian ) , and whose solution can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation @xcite @xmath24 with the set of eigenvalues \\{@xmath25 } and eigenoperators \\{@xmath26 } , the state of the system is known for any time , namely , @xmath27 in which \\{@xmath28 } denotes the coefficients of the decomposition of the initial state into the eigenoperator basis , @xmath29 @xcite .    whereas the steady state , @xmath30 , is related to the eigenoperators whose",

    "hence , the system reaches the steady state when @xmath36 .",
    "in this section , we examine the system relaxation time for two cases in which a pronounced quantum behavior for the cavity mode is not expected , but emerges .",

    "indeed , we will see that the spectral gap of the whole system is exactly the spectral gap of the atomic system .    to derive the reduced dynamics of the atomic system",
    ", we make use of three unitary transformations .",

    "<S> then , considering a real scenario , we would be able to monitor the quantumness of a cavity field in a certain time interval . </S>"
