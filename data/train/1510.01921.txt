    "*   the present study reveals the importance of inclusion of @xmath6 and @xmath5 orbitals in the model space . *",
    "the structure of @xmath55 in @xmath10zr is mainly from @xmath172 configuration .",
    "the structure of @xmath62 states come from @xmath63 configuration , while @xmath64 have @xmath65 configuration . *   for @xmath15zr , @xmath107 to @xmath108 states are fully aligned state of the @xmath106 @xmath72 @xmath101 configuration . * from the energy levels of @xmath10zr and @xmath15zr , we have also estimated reduction of energy gap between proton @xmath173 and @xmath174 orbitals once one more neutron goes into the @xmath6 orbital .",
    "further , we have also shown that once a proton pair is added into the @xmath4 orbital there is a reduction of the neutron @xmath6-@xmath5 shell gap .",
    "* we have calculated electromagnetic properties between different transitions for few high - spin states , wherever experimental data is available . these results indicating deviation with experimental data even with the enhanced values of effective charges .",
    "*   further theoretical work is needed by enlarging model space with protons in full @xmath175 shell and neutrons in @xmath176 space .",
