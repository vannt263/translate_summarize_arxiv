    "mathematical aspects of the higgs algebras have been studied intensively in the past @xcite . generally speaking , in the framework of non - linear algebras ,",
    "the commutation relations between the generators are expressed as a linear combination of power terms of them , this is the case of the @xmath0 algebra , where the commutator of the ladder operators contains up to cubic powers of @xmath1 . in spite of their relative involved structures ,",
    "the fact that the algebras contain as limiting cases the more familiar structures of the groups associated to rotations and vibrations turns out to be a particularly appealing feature for applications to the group classification of nuclear hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "therefore , they may be useful tools to classify observables .",
    "the search for physical inspired hamiltonians , which may display definite features about polynomial algebras is still open .",
    "concrete applications of the formalism have been explored more recently in the context of schematic models @xcite , to complement previous mathematical efforts , like the studies of @xcite . among the already studied applications of the concept of non - linear algebras ,",
    "the results of @xcite can be taken as definite motivations for our present effort .    in this work",
    "we continue with the study of applications of higgs algebras , by constructing a hamiltonian which reproduces the behavior of an asymmetric rotor and its vibrational limit @xcite .",
    "we shall show that , while the finite dimensional representations of non - linear algebras are suitable for the description of rotational - like structures , the infinite dimensional representations of a higgs algebra contain vibrational - like structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the essentials of the formalism , and introduce both the infinite- and finite - dimensional representations of @xmath0 . in section iii.a , we present the basic concepts which we have developed in the construction of a triaxial rotor hamiltonian . in section iii.b we study the vibrational limit of this hamiltonian by contracting a particular , @xmath0 , higgs algebra .",
    "numerical results are presented in section iv .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "to start with we shall consider polynomial angular momentum algebras up to the third power in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the commutation relations of the @xmath0 algebra are defined by @xcite    l [ j_3,j_]=j _ , + [ j_+,j_-]=j_3 ^ 3+j_3 ^ 2+j_3 + ,    [ sl3 ] where the parameters @xmath2 , and @xmath3 take arbitrary real values .",
    "the corresponding casimir operator reads & & c = j_+ j_- + j_3 ^ 4 + ( - ) j_3 ^ 3 + & & + ( - + ) j_3 ^ 2 + ( -+)j_3 .",
    "[ ab ]    notice that @xmath0 comprises , as particular cases , several well - known algebras . in the linear case ( @xmath4 )",
    "we recover the following lie algebras : i ) @xmath5 if @xmath6 and @xmath7 takes any non - zero real value ; ( ii ) @xmath8 if both @xmath7 and @xmath3 take any non - zero real value ; ( iii ) the oscillator algebra @xmath9 if @xmath10 and @xmath3 takes any non - zero real value ; and ( iv ) the poincar algebra for @xmath11 @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "when a parameter ( either @xmath7 or @xmath3 ) is different from zero , it can be reduced to @xmath12 by re - scaling the lie generators . on the other hand , the quadratic algebra @xmath13 is obtained when @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in this case , the linear term @xmath16 can be eliminated by making use of the automorphism @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant that has to be fitted .",
    "we recall that @xmath13 is , for appropriate values of the constants @xmath19 and @xmath3 , the dynamical algebra for the dicke and da providencia - schtte models ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we also remark that in the cubic case given by @xmath20 , the same kind of automorphism allows us to eliminate the quadratic term @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the case with @xmath22 corresponds to the well - known higgs algebra @xcite .",
    "this cubic algebra was found in the study of the kepler potential on a two - dimensional space with constant curvature and has motivated further developments of the representation theory of polynomial algebras @xcite .",
    "finally , note that from the complementary viewpoint , the structure constants @xmath23 in ( [ sl3 ] ) can be interpreted as deformation parameters that generate a wide class of structures by taking the poincar algebra ( with @xmath24 ) as the origin of the space of deformations .",
    "as far as the finite - dimensional representations of @xmath0 is concerned , these are defined on the @xmath25-dimensional basis spanned by the usual vectors @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , like , e.g.  @xcite & & j_3|=(+c ) | , + & & j_+|=f()|+q , + & & j_-|=g()|-q , [ ac ] where @xmath29 is a positive integer number and @xmath30 is a real number . for a given @xmath31 the product of functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 fulfils    l f(-q)g()-f()g(+q ) +    [ ad ] for @xmath34 , and the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 also obey the constraints    l f()=f(-1)=  =f(-q+1)=0 , + g(-)=g(-+1)=  =g(-+q-1)=0 .",
    "[ ae1 ] some other finite - dimensional representations can be found in  @xcite .",
    "infinite - dimensional representations of @xmath0 can be built on the hilbert space of number states spanned by the set @xmath37 , namely : & & j_3|=(+c ) | , + & & j_+|=f()|+q , + & & j_-|=g()|-q .",

    "the expressions appearing in ( [ ac ] ) suggest that the generators @xmath40 play the role of ladder operators with step @xmath29 acting on the state @xmath26 .",
    "likewise , the results shown in equations ( [ ag ] ) relate @xmath41 to ladder operators of a lie algebra to power @xmath29 . , and @xmath42 .",

    "if @xmath0 is interpreted as a dynamical algebra , then the most general hamiltonian based on such non - linear symmetry takes the form = _",

[ ce ] the above expressions demonstrate that finite - dimensional representations of non - symmetric algebras are , therefore , suitable for the treatment of rotational - like structures .",
    "this property is a result of the explicit dependence of the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 upon @xmath48 , which is acting as the effective level of the representation since @xmath49 and @xmath50 vanish if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "similarly , for the case of infinite - dimensional representations one has    l f ( ) = , + g ( ) = ,    [ da ] provided that @xmath45 , @xmath53 is a real constant , and the deformation parameters are    = = 0,= - 8 ^2,=2 ^ 2(4 c-1 ) .",

    "we shall now illustrate the use of the concept of contraction of a higgs algebra , in connection with the structure of @xmath75 , of eq.([hrotor ] ) , in the case of large angular momentum @xmath69 .",
    "in the standard representation of angular momentum @xcite , the hamiltonian of equation ( [ hrotor ] ) can be analyzed by making use of boson mapping techniques @xcite .",

    "it means that , at leading order , both constructions lead to the same results .    the contraction of the lie algebra ( [ ec ] ) to the harmonic oscillator algebra @xmath9 is obtained by introducing the new generators defined by  @xcite : _ = i_,_3=-i_3 + , [ ja ] where @xmath98 is the contraction parameter and @xmath99 is the identity operator , which obviously commutes with @xmath100 and @xmath101 . by computing the new lie brackets and next applying the limit @xmath102",

    "it means that the choice ( [ choi ] ) of the non - linear algebra @xmath0 leads to the triaxial rotor .",

    "particularly , we have shown that : ( i ) by a suitable choice of the parameters entering the definition of the cubic algebra , one may obtain the triaxial rotor , and , ( ii ) in the limit of large angular momentum , the vibrational structure emerges as a contraction of the algebra .",
    "we think that these results suggest the existence of direct physical realizations of the higgs algebra for the case of hamiltonians describing nuclear vibrations and rotations , as it was found for the case of classical hamiltonians , e.g. the study of the kepler potential on a two - dimensional curved space .    for the specific application to nuclear structure problems ,",
    "the potential of non - linear algebras in dealing with the construction of hamiltonians becomes evident .",
    "the use of non - linear algebras , like the @xmath0 or even algebras with a larger number of generators , may shead light on more involved structures lying in between the rotational and vibrational extremes .",
