    "double numbers ( or , as they are called sometimes , hyperbolic - complex or splittable numbers ) are known for quite a long time , and find applications both in mathematics and physics @xcite . taking into account that their corresponding algebra is isomorphic to the direct sum of two real algebras , it was considered for a long time that the properties of double numbers are not interesting , and moreover , that these are even trivial , while compared to complex numbers .    in this paper",
    "we try to prove the wrongness of this opinion and to show that the possibilities offered by the algebra and the analysis ( i.e. , the @xmath0-analysis ) of double numbers , considered together with the associated geometry of the 2-dimensional plane , are still far from being exhaustively studied .",
    "we shall see that , in many respects , double numbers are far  in any sense , from being inferior to complex numbers",
    ". considering the important circumstance that the geometry of double numbers is pseudo - euclidean and hence corresponding to the 2-dimensional geometry of space - time , we obtain a new framework fruitful in ideas for physics , which have a purely algebraic essence .",
    "a special particular feature of our study expresses the fact that the @xmath0-analytic mappings of double variable cover an infinite - dimensional space  which is exactly the case for the functions of one complex variable .",
    "moreover , to each mapping defined on the complex plane , it corresponds a unique @xmath0-analytic mapping of double variable , and converse .    in section [ doubleee ] ,",
    "we concisely present properties of the plane of double variable and define the hyperbolic polar coordinate system , cones , @xmath0-conformal mappings and study their general properties . in section [ holooo ] , we define the @xmath0-holomorphic mappings and discuss several of their properties , which include analogs of the cauchy formula and the cauchy theorem , of the cauchy - riemann conditions , and of @xmath0-conformal mappings . in section [ elemmm ] , we define and study the properties of standard hyperbolic elementary functions of double variable .",
    "at last , in the conclusions section , we discuss the potential applications and the perspectives of further work in developing the present theory of functions of double variable .",
    "by analogy with the algebra of complex numbers @xmath1 , we define the algebra of double numbers @xmath2 by means of two generators @xmath3 of the 2-dimensional @xmath4-modules with the related multiplication table : @xmath5 having in view the further application of this algebra to describing the 2-dimensional space - time , we shall denote the elements of @xmath2 as : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . similarly to the complex numbers , the real number @xmath8 will be called _ the real part _ of the double number @xmath0 , and the real number @xmath9 will be called _ the imaginary part _ of the double number @xmath0 .",
    "the algebra of double numbers with the multiplication table ( [ alg2 ] ) does not determine a numerical field , since it contains zero - divisors , i.e. , the equation @xmath10 may be satisfied by nonzero elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is one of the reasons for which double numbers were not widely used in applications , as the complex numbers did .",
    "but exactly this feature shows in algebraic terms a very important circumstance of the 2-dimensional space - time  the occurrence of light - cones .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of double numbers is analogous to the interpretation of complex numbers : in the plane of double variable ( in brief  on the hyperbolic plane ) , to each double number there corresponds a position - vector , whose coordinates are the real and the imaginary parts of this number . here , the sum and the difference of double numbers is represented by the standard parallelogram rule for the corresponding position vectors on the hyperbolic plane    the involutive operation of _ complex conjugation _ for double numbers can be defined in the following way : @xmath13 . geometrically , this operation describes the reflection of the hyperbolic plane with respect to the axis @xmath14 . like in the complex case , the couple @xmath15 can be regarded as independent double coordinates on the hyperbolic plane , which relate to the cartesian coordinates by means of the formulas : @xmath16    the complex coordinate bilinear form @xmath17 splits into its symmetric @xmath18 and skew - symmetric @xmath19 irreducible components , as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a pseudo - euclidean metric form , and @xmath22 is the 2-dimensional volume form .",
    "we note , that the algebra of double numbers induces on the plane of double variable a 2-dimensional pseudo - euclidean ( hyperbolic ) geometry endowed with the metric form @xmath18 , which justifies the established by us denomination `` hyperbolic plane '' .",
    "the transition to hyperbolic polar coordinates and to the exponential form of representing double numbers exhibit a series of special features , which are absent in the case of complex numbers .",
    "the pair of lines @xmath23 contains the subset of double numbers with zero squared norm does not allow us to speak about the norm of a double number in its rigorous meaning ] .",
    "for the brevity of terms and for preserving the partial analogy to the complex numbers , we shall call the quantity @xmath24 _ the norm _ or _ the module _ of the double number ( see further formula [ regih ] )",
    ". the lines of double numbers whose square of the norm vanishes , split the whole hyperbolic plane into four quadrant - type domains , which are represented on the drawing by the numbers i , ii , iii and iv ( fig.[psi ] ) .",
    "= 0.50 mm    = 0.70 mm    one can immediately verify that in each of the mentioned areas , the double numbers allow a hyperbolic polar representation of the form : @xmath25 where for each quadrant take place the following definitions of quantities : @xmath26 the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 , defined in each of the quadrants by the formulas ( [ regih ] ) , will be called _ the module _ and respectively _ the argument _ of the double number @xmath0 .",
    "in this way , in each of the quadrants we have @xmath29 , and the quadrants themselves are parametrized by different copies of real lines , which together determine _ the manifold @xmath30 of angular variables _ as a oriented disjoint sum @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , the manifold @xmath30 can be suggestively represented by compactifying each copy of @xmath4 into an open interval and further by gluing the intervals at their ends to obtain a circle with four pinched points .",
    "we note , that the set of double numbers of zero norm is not described in any of the coordinate charts introduced above of the hyperbolic polar coordinate system . in the following",
    ", we shall call the subset of double numbers of the form @xmath32 ( where @xmath33  some fixed double number , @xmath0 is any double number ) as _ the cone of the number @xmath33 _ and will be denoted as @xmath34 . all the points which lie in @xmath34 , have their hyperbolic distance to the point @xmath33 equal to zero .",
    "sometimes we shall make a difference between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , depending accordingly on the signs in ( [ con ] ) . in the same way",
    ", we can distinguish the sub - cones @xmath37 and @xmath38 , relative to the cases @xmath39 and @xmath40 accordingly and the sub - cones @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the cases @xmath43 and @xmath44 , accordingly .",
    "all the cones and subcones are shown in fig.[conus ] .    the hyperbolic euler formula : @xmath45 can be verified by expanding the left and right sides into formal maclaurin series , and comparing their real and imaginary parts .",
    "the hyperbolic euler formula leads to the exponential representation of double numbers : @xmath46 where in the last equality we passed to the `` complex hyperbolic angle '' @xmath47 having sense in the first quadrant .",
    "so , the product of a pair of double numbers reduces to adding their hyperbolic angles and the product of the sign factors @xmath48 .",
    "the formulas for computing lengths of curves and areas of domains in @xmath49 reads as follows : @xmath50=\\int\\limits_{\\tau_a}^{\\tau_b}\\sqrt{|\\dot h\\ ,      \\dot{\\bar h}|}\\ , d\\tau;\\quad      \\text{area}[\\sigma]=-\\frac{j}{2}\\int\\limits_{\\sigma}dh      \\wedge d\\bar h=-\\frac{j}{4}\\oint\\limits_{\\partial\\sigma}(h\\ , d\\bar h-\\bar h\\ , dh),\\ ] ] where in the last equality we used the double number variant of the foundamental poincar - darboux theorem regarding the integration of differential forms .    .",
    "we shall compute the length of the arc of euclidean circle of euclidean radius @xmath51 whose center is zero , encompassed between the points @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the plane of double variable . substituting in the euclidean equation of the circle @xmath54 the polar hyperbolic",
    "coordinates : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , we get the hyperbolic polar equation of the euclidean circle : @xmath57 constructing the pseudo - euclidean line - element : @xmath58 along the circle , by considering ( [ pcirc ] ) , we get after several elementary calculations and differentiation : @xmath59 due to the symmetry of the arc relative to the first bisector @xmath60 , it suffices to compute the length of the half of the arc in which @xmath28 varies from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , and then we double the obtained result .",
    "the integral which provides this length is : @xmath63 using the substitution : @xmath64 , this integral reduces to a simpler form , and can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals of first and second order : @xmath65\\approx1.2r\\ ] ]",
    "the function @xmath66 , defined by formula ( [ lnh ] ) , is a simple and important sample of the class of so - called _ @xmath0-holomorphic mappings of double variable _ , whose definition emerges from considerations similar to those which yield the definition of holomorphic functions of complex variable",
    ". any smooth mapping @xmath67 can be represented by a pair of real components , and we can pass ( with using of ( [ coordh ] ) ) to its representation by means of a pair of double variables @xmath68 , as follows : @xmath69 if @xmath70 is regarded now as the plane @xmath49 of double variable , then we can naturally limit ourselves to the mappings which preserve the hyperbolic complex structure of the plane , i.e. , such mappings of the form @xmath71 . the differentiable functions @xmath72 , which satisfy the condition relative to its arguments is similar to the one used in real analysis .",
    "namely , we can define the differentiability of a function @xmath73 at the point @xmath15 as the following property of its variation : @xmath74 , where @xmath75^{1/2}$ ] is the pseudo - euclidean norm of the variation of the variable . passing to different limits for @xmath76",
    ", we obtain the definition of partial derivatives or `` directional derivatives '' .",
    "we encounter several significant problems , related to the definition of the convergence and the limit by natural for the double numbers hyperbolic norm . in this paper",
    "we shall not deal with these purely mathematical questions and we use only those operations and properties , whose definitions are clear , though to a certain extent , formal . ] : @xmath77 are called _ @xmath0-holomorphic mappings of double variable @xmath0_. the functions which satisfy the condition : @xmath78 are called _ anti - holomorphic _ mappings of double variable .    by analogy to holomorphic functions of complex variable , the holomorphic functions of double variable can be defined by formal power series , whose convergence often follows from the convergence of the corresponding real series .    .",
    "the following identities can be straightforward verified by means of expansion into formal series : @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the sinus ( elliptic or hyperbolic ) , @xmath83 is the cosine ( elliptic or hyperbolic ) in the left and the right hand sides of the equalities , accordingly , which are defined by their standard series .",
    "in fact , these equalities are particular cases of the more general identity : @xmath84 where @xmath85/2 $ ] , @xmath86/2 $ ] are , respectively , the symmetric and the skew - symmetric parts of the arbitrary analytic function @xmath87 .",
    "we shall show , that a holomorphic function always maps zero - divisors to zero - divisors .",
    "the proof relies on the following formal identity : @xmath88 for @xmath89 , the identity immediately emerges from the simpler one : @xmath90 . for arbitrary @xmath91",
    ", we need to use the expansion formulas into maclaurin series . from one side , one has @xmath92 on the other side , @xmath93 multiplying this line , term by term , with @xmath94 , we get : @xmath95 @xmath96 by combining in the expansion ( [ row3 ] ) all the successive pairs of even terms ( which contain @xmath53 ) , we obtain all the successive even terms of the series ( [ row1 ] ) , and combining in ( [ row3 ] ) all the successive pairs of even terms ( beginning with the pair `` third - fifth '' ) , we get all the successive odd terms of the series ( [ row1 ] ) ( beginning with the third one ) . in this way ,",
    "the formal series from the left and right sides of ( [ eqqh1 ] ) coincide , q.e.d .",
    "considering now a holomorphic function @xmath97 given by a power series : @xmath98 due to the identity ( [ eqqh1 ] ) , we get on the cone @xmath34 of the arbitrary point @xmath33 : @xmath99 which proves the claim . in fact , as we notice from the obtained expression , the holomorphic mapping can provide an inversion of the cone ( i.e. , it can maps the component @xmath100 into the corresponding component @xmath101 and converse ) , but it can not map its branches @xmath102 and @xmath103 one into another .",
    "it is easy to check that the last property is achieved by means of anti - holomorphic mappings    .",
    "let s write the condition ( [ anh ] ) in cartesian coordinates : @xmath104 this implies _ the cauchy - riemann condition of hyperbolic analyticity _ :",
    "@xmath105 if the mapping @xmath73 is @xmath0-holomorphic in the sense of the former definition , then the mapping @xmath106 is @xmath0-holomorphic as well .",

    "for this reason , the formulas ( [ crh1 ] ) are correctly defined on @xmath2 minus the cross - shape lines of its zero - divisors .",

    "our results correspond to such an integral , considered in the sense of its principal value . for its existence , the contour has to transversally approach the lines of the cone .",

    "the lack of acknowledgement which the hyperbolic conformal mapping receive is firstly related by the non - traditional way in which are posed the initial - boundary problems , which can be solved by the method of hyperbolic conformal transformations .",
    "indeed , the use of conformal transformations in the plane of complex variable for solving problems of elliptic type , which are related to the laplace equation , relies on the circumstances which were formerly described : the holomorphic mapping @xmath324 , whose real part represents the solution of some boundary problem , maps the boundary from outside the sources of the field into the straight line @xmath325 .",

    "it is obvious , that such a posing of the problem is different from the standard one , since the providing of the initial - boundary conditions change to _ providing the form of the world - surface ( lines ) of constant potential_. this surface has a space - time character . in principle",

    "the event points of space - time , given by the readings of the devices provide @xmath334 and give the needed surface . according to the above considerations , the form of this surface uniquely defines the solution of the wave equation .",

    "are represented the subsequent time slices of the surface , which is shown in the left picture , for @xmath339 .",
    "we showed the general features of the fundamental for physics analogy between complex and double numbers .",
    "the algebraic description of the geometry and physics in 2-dimensional space - time by means of double numbers is not less appealing than describing the problems on the euclidean plane by means of of complex numbers .",
    "we have left non - addressed a series of problems ( which essentially have a mathematical character ) , which appear along this path , giving priority to resemblance more than to rigor .",
    "the difficulties encountered in the analysis based on the natural metric ( i.e. , in the case examined by us , pseudo - euclidean ) topology are well known to the specialists in mathematical relativity theory and these ( together with the difficulties of psychologic character ) were the reason for rather low interest from physicists and mathematicians towards double numbers regarding their applications . in our opinion , these difficulties can be in principle removed , and moreover , what is usually considered to be `` difficulty '' is in fact the expression of several new fundamental concepts , which the geometry of space - time brings to physics and mathematics .",
    "the formerly described tight correspondence between the complex and the double planes can be also extended to vector fields . like for each holomorphic function on the complex plane there corresponds some potential or solenoidal vector field , related to sources , vortices , dipoles , quadrupoles , etc , at the points where the holomorphicity of a @xmath0-holomorphic function is lost",
    ", we can also give sense to some vector field in the 2-dimensional space - time , whose singularities now have not elliptic , but hyperbolic properties .",
    "thus , we have the possibility to talk about hyperbolic positive and negative sources , hyperbolic vortices and vortex - wells , multipoles , zhukowskiy hyperbolic function , etc .",
    "the vector fields which are generated by these @xmath0-holomorphic mappings have remarkable properties , like potentiality and solenoidality , which are obviously apprehended in a hyperbolic meaning .",
    "another interesting consequence provided by the @xmath0-holomorphic functions of double variable is related to the possibility of regarding their associated conformal mappings , as changes from non - inertial reference systems in the flat 2-dimensional space - time .",
    "then the study of the group of conformal symmetries naturally extends the frames of 2-dimensional special relativity theory , in which there are usually considered only the isometric mappings , regarded as changes between inertial reference systems .",
    "such a possibility ( due to the absence of a corresponding infinite - dimensional conformal symmetry group ) does not exist in three and four - dimensional pseudo - euclidean spaces , but still , this exists in two dimensions and also in several three and four - dimensional flat finsler geometries , e.g. , in spaces with berwald - moor metric , whose particular case is , in fact , the space of double numbers itself ( @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of a fundamental symmetry group ( linear isometric , and non - linear conformal ) was widespread in physics , though the use of the infinite conformal groups was in its essence limited to the case of 2-dimensional geometry with quadratic metrics .",
    "while passing from quadratic metric forms of space - time to @xmath205-ary metric forms , this limitation is sometimes removed , and the problem of finslerian extensions of srt and grt becomes actual and promising .",
    "we need to emphasize that we talk about extensions , and not about any rejection of the classic representations , since we assume that the symmetry group which lie at the basis of previous physical - mathematical constructions , appear as in some sense secondary ( induced ) fact of the new infinite - dimensional symmetry groups existence . due to the limited space offered by a journal article ,",
