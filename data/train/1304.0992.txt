    "the smart grid ( sg ) is envisioned to be a large - scale next generation cyber - physical system that will improve the efficiency , reliability , and robustness of future power and energy grids by integrating the consumers as one of its key management components  @xcite , and thus , achieve a system which is clean , safe , reliable , resilient and sustainable .",
    "this heterogeneous network will motivate the adoption of advanced technologies that will increase the participation of its consumers to overcome various technical challenges at different levels of demand - supply balance  @xcite .    in this respect ,",
    "game theory , which is an analytical framework to capture the complex interactions among rational players  @xcite is studied in this paper to model an energy trading scheme for the sg .",
    "the model uses the two - way communication facility of the sg  @xcite , and inspires the customers to _ spontaneously _ take part in _ supplying _ their surplus energy ( se ) to the grid so as to assist the power grid ( pg ) in balancing the excess energy demand at the peak hour .",
    "this voluntary participation of consumers in energy trading is very important in the context of sg because of its ability to greatly enhance the sg s reliability , and thus , improve the social benefit of the electricity market  @xcite .",
    "we use the framework of a stackelberg game  @xcite for this model in which the pg is considered as the leader and energy users ( eus ) are the followers . here , on the one hand , the pg decides on the total amount of energy it wants to buy , and also on the price per unit of energy it needs to pay to each eu . on the other hand , the eu decides on its amount of energy to be sold to the pg in response to the price offered to it .",
    "we note that energy management in the context of sg has been receiving considerable attention recently .",
    "for example , energy management for sgs in a vehicle - to - grid ( v2 g ) scenario have been studied in @xcite and the references therein , whereby the application of game theory for demand - supply balance in sgs can be found in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , little has been done in prioritizing the consumers benefit in management modeling where the main priority of the energy management scheme is to benefit the consumers .",
    "we stress that consumers are the core element of the evolution of sg as explained in @xcite , and hence , their benefit is one of the most important concerns of any demand - supply modeling scheme . in this respect ,",
    "we propose an energy management scheme that prioritizes the consumers in the sg and balances demand with supply at peak hours .",
    "we first formulate a noncooperative _ stackelberg _ game ( nsg ) to study the interactions between the pg and eus in the sg , and show that the optimal demand - supply balance can be achieved at the solution of the game ; then we analyze properties of the game in terms of existence and optimality , and it is shown that the game possesses a socially optimal solution ; finally , we propose a distributed algorithm to reach the solution of the game , and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated via numerical experiments .",
    "consider an sg network that consists of a single pg and a number of eus .",
    "the set of eus is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 . here",
    ", the pg refers to the main electricity grid which is servicing a group of customers at peak hours of the day ( i.e. , @xmath2 pm to @xmath3 pm ) , and each eu @xmath4 is a group of similar idle energy users  @xcite , connected via an aggregator  @xcite , such as smart homes , electric vehicles , wind mills , solar panels and bio - gas plants that have some se for sale after regular usage .",
    "it is assumed that the pg can communicate with the eus through smart meters via an appropriate communication protocol  @xcite .    due to frequent change of energy state in the grid ,",
    "energy management in the sg needs to be carried out frequently  @xcite , and therefore , the total peak hour duration can be divided into multiple time slots  @xcite . as energy demands by the customers are very high during the peak hours , the pg may be unable to balance some of the demands from its own generation in some of these time slots .",
    "meanwhile , the pg needs to buy energy from alternative energy sources such as idle eus who have se , and may agree to sell it to the pg with appropriate incentives . for the rest of the paper , we will concentrate on the energy management in a single time slot .",
    "it is assumed that the energy deficiency of the pg , @xmath5 , at any time slot is fixed although the deficiency may vary from one time slot to the next .",
    "however , as the required energy by the pg is fixed during a time slot , the pg would not be interested in buying more energy than @xmath5 to keep its cost at a minimum .",
    "thus , if each eu @xmath6 with se @xmath7 provides the pg with energy @xmath8 , these quantities need to satisfy @xmath9 to buy an offered amount of energy @xmath8 , the pg pays a price @xmath10 per unit of energy to eu @xmath6 as an incentive .",
    "however , the pg may need to pay different incentives to different eus due to their different amounts of se .",
    "for instance , a lower incentive may not affect the intended revenue of an eu with higher se as it can sell more , but could severely affect the revenue of eus with smaller amounts of se .",
    "moreover , the pg may also want to minimize its total cost of purchase as it would further enable the pg to sell this energy at a cheaper rate to its customer .",
    "this would facilitate the trading of energy between the pg and the eus in the network rather than establishing more expensive generators or bulk capacitors to meet any excess demand , and also , the cheaper rate would benefit the consumers who buy the energy from the pg . to this end , we assume that the pg estimates a total price @xmath11 per unit of energy , analogous to the _ total cost per unit production _ in economics  @xcite , in each time slot using a real time price estimation technique as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the pg uses this @xmath11 to optimize the price @xmath10 it will pay to each eu @xmath6 to order to minimize its total cost while maintaining the constraint @xmath12 the equality constraint in establishes that the announced total price per unit energy must be paid to all eus , and thus motivates the eus to take part in energy trading with the pg . here , @xmath13 is the minimum price that the pg needs to pay eu @xmath6 to incentivize it to trade energy , and @xmath14 is the maximum price that the pg can pay .",
    "although @xmath11 is fixed , @xmath10 can be different for different @xmath6 based on @xmath8 .",
    "in a consumer - prioritized sg , the beneficiaries of the energy management scheme are the consumers in the network  @xcite . in this regard , we propose an nsg , in which on the one hand , the objective of each eu @xmath6 is to voluntarily sell an amount of energy @xmath8 to the pg based on @xmath7 and the offered price @xmath10 so as to maximize its own utility . on the other hand",
    ", the pg wants to minimize its total cost of purchase by optimizing @xmath10 for different @xmath6 as explained in section  [ system - model ] . to this end",
    ", we now define the objective functions of the leader and followers of the game .",
    "the considered utility function of eu @xmath6 , @xmath15 , is based on a linearly decreasing marginal benefit , which is appropriate for energy users  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the utility function is also assumed to possess the following properties : i ) the utility of eu @xmath6 increases with the amount of se @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath16 ; and ii ) the utility of an eu increases as @xmath10 increases , i.e. , @xmath17 . to meet the above properties , in this work we consider the following utility function for eu @xmath6 : @xmath18 from",
    ", we note that the addition of the quantity @xmath19 to @xmath20 in does not affect the solution .",
    "consequently , all the eus equivalently maximize @xmath21 subject to the constraint @xmath22 . here ,",
    "@xmath23^t$ ] , @xmath24^t$ ] and @xmath25^t$ ] .",
    "on the other hand , the pg s target is to decide on its price @xmath10 based on the offered energy @xmath8 by eu @xmath6 so as to minimize the total cost of purchase @xmath26 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the individual cost including the cost of purchasing with price @xmath10 and other associated costs . for @xmath27",
    ", we consider a convex cost function @xmath28 which is comparable to the practical cost function of some utility companies  @xcite . in",
    ", the first term captures the cost of purchasing energy , whereas the associated costs are reflected in the last two terms . in",
    ", @xmath29 possesses the following properties : i ) @xmath29 increases with the increase of @xmath10 .",
    "that is @xmath30 ; and ii ) @xmath29 is strictly convex .",
    "thus , for @xmath31 and any real number @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the objective of the pg is to minimize its total cost , and thus , the net cost function of the pg is @xmath34 as eus are owned by individual consumers , the pg can not directly control their decision making processes , and hence , a decentralized control mechanism is required for both eus and the pg to decide on @xmath8 and @xmath10 by optimizing their respective utility and cost functions in and .",
    "the pg and eus interact with each other to decide on their energy trading parameters @xmath10 and @xmath8 , and we propose an nsg @xmath35 to capture this interaction . in this game ,",
    "the pg is the leader who decides on the price @xmath10 for the amount of energy offered by the eu @xmath6 , and each eu @xmath6 is a follower who agrees on @xmath8 to be offered to the pg in response to @xmath10 by playing a generalized nash game ( gng )  @xcite with other followers in the sg .",
    "hence , the proposed nsg can be defined by its strategic form as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the set of all players in the game , and @xmath38 is the vector of strategies of eu @xmath6 satisfying .    in this game ,",
    "an eu s decision is affected by the strategies of other eus through , and thus , the gng amongst eus , to decide on @xmath39 , is a jointly convex generalized nash equilibrium problem ( gnep )  @xcite , whose solution is a generalized nash equilibrium ( gne ) .",
    "the proposed game is played in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "the game is initiated with the announcement of the price @xmath40 satisfying by the pg , upon which the eus play a gnep to decide on the gne energy set @xmath41 they wish to sell to the pg .",
    "the pg receives the offered energy @xmath41 and thereby obtains some insight into the capacity , each eu receives a similar incentive , and thus their offered energies reflect their capacities of supply . ] of each eu @xmath6 . in the second step ,",
    "the pg optimizes its price vector to @xmath42^t$ ] , by a constraint optimization technique for the offered @xmath41 .",
    "thereafter , the eus again decide on their gne energy vector @xmath43^t$ ] in response to @xmath44 and the proposed nsg reaches its noncooperative stackelberg equilibrium ( nse ) .",
    "[ definition-1 ] consider the nsg @xmath35 in , in which @xmath45 and @xmath46 are defined by and respectively .",
    "a set of strategies @xmath47 constitutes the nse of the game if and only if the strategy set satisfies the following set of inequalities : @xmath48 and @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the energy vector of all eus in the set @xmath0 except eu @xmath6 , and similarly , @xmath51 is the price vector set by the pg for all eus in @xmath0 excluding @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , at the nse , neither any eu nor the pg can increase its utility by deviating from its nse strategy while all other players in the sg are playing their nse strategies .      in this section , we investigate the existence of a _ socially optimal _ solution which is beneficial for all the consumers in the sg , and thus , suitable for the proposed consumer - prioritized energy management scheme . in this regard",
    ", first we note that the proposed nsg reaches the nse as soon as all eus agree on a gne energy vector @xmath52 in response to the optimized price vector @xmath44 set by the pg .",
    "due to the strict convexity of , there always exists a unique solution  @xcite for the price vector @xmath44 , and thus , the existence of a socially optimal gne of the _ followers gnep _ would _ guarantee _ the existence of a socially optimal nse of the _ proposed nsg_.    [ theorem-1 ] there exists a socially optimal gne solution for the gnep amongst the eus in response to the price set by the pg .",
    "first , we note that the proposed gnep is a jointly convex gnep due to the coupled constraint , and hence , the gnep can be formulated as a variational inequality ( vi ) problem vi(@xmath53 )  @xcite , which can be used to determine a vector @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "here , @xmath56 is the vector of strategies of all eus satisfying and , from  @xcite @xmath57 the solution of a vi is a variational equilibrium ( ve ) , which is the socially optimal solution among other gnes  @xcite . to this end ,",
    "our main concern it to study the existence of the ve of the gnep , and thus , check the optimality of the solution .",
    "hereinafter , we will use gnep and vi interchangeably , and ve to refer to both the ve and gne of the gnep .",
    "now , the pseudo - gradient of the joint utility function @xmath45 in is  @xcite @xmath58,\\label{eqn - pseudo - grad}\\ ] ] and the jacobean of , @xmath59 , is an identity matrix .",
    "hence , @xmath59 is positive definite on @xmath56 , and consequently , @xmath60 is strictly monotone .",
    "therefore , vi@xmath61 admits a unique ve  @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the joint convexity of the proposed gnep , the unique ve is also the global unique maximizer of  @xcite , and thus , the existence of a _ socially optimal _ ve of the proposed gnep is proved .    from theorem  [ theorem-1 ]",
    ", we can further conclude that the proposed nsg possesses a socially optimal nse .      in this section ,",
    "we propose a distributed algorithm for the considered nsg to reach the socially optimal nse .",
    "the algorithm is implemented based on the fact that @xmath60 is strongly monotone , and thus , the slack variables @xmath62 all possess the same value @xmath63 at the ve  @xcite .",
    "we assume that there is limited communication between the pg and eus via the two - way communications of the sg , and thus , the pg can inform the eu @xmath6 if its offered energy @xmath8 is beyond the ve in response to @xmath64 ( by checking whether @xmath65 ) .",
    "we use a hyperplane projection method for the vi , which is the simplest solution method for a monotone vi  @xcite , and its solution is always guaranteed to converge to a non - empty ve  @xcite .",
    "since the pg s optimization problem is strictly convex and has a unique solution , consequently , the proposed algorithm also guarantees that the nsg will reach its socially optimal nse .",
    "the algorithm is executed in two steps as shown in algorithm  [ algorithm-1 ] . as a hyperplane projection method",

    "allows the pg to buy its energy from more eus , and thus , enables the pg to pay a cheaper rate .",
    "consequently , the total cost incurred by the pg decreases .",
    "however , to keep all the eus participating , the pg needs to pay the minimum mandatory price @xmath13 to each eu .",
    "thus , as the number of eus increases from @xmath94 to @xmath105 , the total cost to the pg increases due to the mandatory payment to a large number of eus .",
    "[ fig - costwith - eu ] shows that the proposed scheme has significantly lower total cost to the pg at small network sizes , e.g. , for @xmath106 eus the average total cost for the proposed scheme is half the total cost incurred by the fit scheme . however , as the network size increases , the average total cost for the proposed nsg becomes closer to the fit scheme .",
    "in fact , as the network size increases , the pg needs to optimize its price for a large number of eus while maintaining the minimum payment .",
    "hence , due to the constraint , a large number of eus causes the pg to choose a price close to its minimum payment and consequently , the total cost for the proposed nsg becomes closer to that of the fit scheme .",
