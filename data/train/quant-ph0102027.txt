    "the density operator of a quantum system describes the preparation of the system in all details relevant to statistical experiments . like a classical probability distribution it can not be measured on a single system , but can only be estimated on an ensemble sequence of identically prepared systems .",
    "in fact , if we could determine the density operator on a single quantum system , we could combine the measurement with a device re - preparing several systems with the measured density operator , in contradiction to the well - known no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "this points to a close connection between the problem of estimating the density operator and approximate cloning . in the case of inputs promised to be in a pure state the optimal solutions to both problems",
    "are known @xcite , and it turns out that in a sense the limit of the cloning problem for output number @xmath3 is equivalent to the estimation problem .",
    "the `` optimal '' cloning transformation was shown in this case to be quite insensitive to the figure of merit defining optimality @xcite .    in the case of mixed input states much less is known about the cloning problem .",
    "it is likely that in this case there may be different natural figures of merit leading to inequivalent `` optimal '' solutions .",
    "even the classical version the problem is not trivial , and is related to the so - called bootstrap technique @xcite in classical statistics .",
    "the estimation problem certainly has many solutions .",
    "in fact , any procedure of determining the density matrix through the measurement of the expectations of a suitable `` quorum '' of observables @xcite , such as in quantum state tomography @xcite is a solution .",
    "other methods include adaptive schemes @xcite where the result of one measurement is used to select the next one . in all these cases , the estimate amounts to the measurement of an observable on the full input state @xmath4 , which factorizes into one - site observables .",
    "what we are concerned with here is , as in the work of vidal et .",
    "@xcite , the search for improved estimates , admitting arbitrary observables on the @xmath0-fold input system , including `` entangled '' ones .",
    "in contrast to @xcite however we are not interested in estimators which are optimal for a more or less general figure of merit , but in the asymtotic behaviour if the number @xmath0 of input systems goes to infinity ( in this context see also the work of gill and massar @xcite ) .    when @xmath5 is the hilbert space of a single system , the overall input density operator of the estimation problem is @xmath4 , which lives on the @xmath6 tensor power @xmath7 .",
    "this space has a natural orthogonal decomposition according to the irreducible representations of the permutation group of @xmath0 points , acting as the permutations of the tensor factors .",
    "equivalently , this is the decomposition according to the irreducible representations of the unitary group on @xmath8 ( see below ) .",
    "it is well - known that this orthogonal decomposition is labeled by _ young frames _ ,",
    "i.e. , by the arrangements of @xmath0 boxes into @xmath9 rows of lengths @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "there is a striking similarity here with the spectra we want to estimate , which are given by sequences of the eigenvalues of @xmath1 , say , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "the basic idea of this paper is to show that this is not a superficial similarity : measuring the young frame ( by an observable whose eigenprojections are the projections in the orthogonal decomposition ) is , in fact , a good estimate of the spectrum .",
    "more precisely , we show that the probability for the error @xmath14 to be larger than a fixed @xmath15 for some @xmath16 decreases exponentially as @xmath2 .",
    "our basic technique is the theory of large deviations @xcite , in particular a result by duffield @xcite on the large deviation properties of tensor powers of group representations .",
    "this will allow us to compute the rate of exponential convergence explicitly .",
    "in order to state our result , explicitly , we need to recall the decomposition theory for @xmath0-fold tensor products . throughout",
    ", the one - particle space @xmath8 will be the @xmath9-dimensional hilbert space @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "two group representations play a crucial role : firstly , the representation @xmath19 of the general linear group @xmath20 and , secondly , the representation @xmath21 of the permutations @xmath22 on @xmath0 points , represented by permuting the tensor factors : @xmath23 the basic result @xcite is that these two representations are `` commutants '' of each other , i.e. , any operator on @xmath24 commuting with all @xmath25 is a linear combination of the @xmath26 , and conversely .",
    "this leads to the decomposition @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are irreducible representations , and the restriction of @xmath30 to unitary operators is unitary .",
    "the summation index @xmath31 runs over all young frames with @xmath9 rows and @xmath0 boxes , as described in the introduction .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the projection onto the corresponding summand in the above decomposition .",
    "let us consider now the estimation problem .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , we are searching for an observable @xmath33 describing a measurement on @xmath0 @xmath9-level systems , whose readouts are possible spectra of @xmath9-level density operators .",
    "the set of possible spectra will be denoted by @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the ordering relation on @xmath36 given by @xmath37 technically , @xmath33 must be a positive operator valued measure on this set , assigning to each measurable subset @xmath38 a positive operator @xmath39 , whose expectation in any given state is interpreted as the probability for the measurement to yield a result @xmath40 .",
    "the citerion for a good estimator @xmath33 is that , for any one - particle density operator @xmath1 , the value measured on a state @xmath4 is likely to be close to the true spectrum @xmath41 of @xmath1 , i.e. , that the probability @xmath42 is small when @xmath43 is the complement of a small ball around @xmath44 .",
    "of course , we will look at this problem for large @xmath0 .",
    "so our task is to find a whole sequence of observables @xmath33 , @xmath45 , making error probabilities like ( [ eq:1 ] ) go to zero as @xmath2 .",
    "the search for efficient estimation strategies @xmath33 can be simplified greatly by symmetry arguments . to see this , consider a permutation @xmath46 .",
    "if we insert the transformed estimator @xmath47 into equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) we see immediately that @xmath48 remains unchanged . replacing @xmath49 by the average @xmath50",
    "shows that we may assume @xmath51 = 0 $ ] for all permutations @xmath52 , without loss of estimation quality . a similar argument together with the fact that the quality of the estimate is judged by some criterion not depending on the choice of a basis in @xmath8 shows that we may assume in addition that @xmath49 commutes with all unitaries @xmath53 .",
    "but this implies according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) that @xmath49 must be a function of the projection operators @xmath54 defined at the beginning of this section .",
    "if we require in addition that each @xmath49 be a projection , which is suggestive for ruling out unnecessary fuzziness , @xmath33 must be of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an arbitrary mapping assigning to each young frame @xmath31 ( with @xmath9 rows and @xmath0 boxes ) an estimate @xmath57 .",
    "in other words , the estimation proceeds by first measuring the young frame projections @xmath32 and then computing an estimate @xmath58 on the basis of the result @xmath31 .     for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the set @xmath62 is the triangle with corners @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 . ]",
    "the simplest choice is clearly to take the normalized young frames themselves as the estimate , i.e. , @xmath66 it turns out somewhat surprisingly that with this choice the @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) form an asymptotically exact estimator . by this",
    "we mean that , for every @xmath1 , the probability measures @xmath67 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) converge weakly to the point measure at the spectrum @xmath44 of @xmath1 .",
    "explicitly , for each continuous function @xmath68 on @xmath62 we have @xmath69    we illustrate this in figure  [ fig1 ] , for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath1 a density operator with spectrum @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath62 is a triangle with corners @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath70 , and we plot the probabilities @xmath71 over @xmath72 .",
    "the explicit computation uses the weyl character formula  ( * ? ? ? * ix.9.1 ) , which we do not need elsewhere in the paper .    clearly , the distribution is peaked at the true spectrum and our claim is that this will become exact in the limit @xmath2 . to prove convergence we will use large deviation methods which give us not only the convergence just stated but an _ exponential error estimate _ of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes a positive function on @xmath62 , called the _ rate function _ , which vanishes only for @xmath75 .    for the statement of the main theorem",
    "we say that a measurable subset @xmath38 has `` small boundary '' , if its interior is dense in its closure .",
    "a typical choice for @xmath43 is the complement of a ball around the true spectrum",
    ".    theorem .",
    "the estimator defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) is asymptotically exact .",
    "moreover , we have the error estimate @xmath76 for any set @xmath38 with small boundary , where the rate function @xmath77 $ ] is @xmath78    the expression for @xmath74 is the relative entropy @xcite of the probability vectors @xmath79 and @xmath44 .",
    "relative entropies occur also as the rate functions in large deviation properties of independent identically distributed ( classical @xcite or quantum @xcite ) random variables , although there seems to be no direct way to reduce the above theorem to these standard setups .",
    "rather than giving a proof of every detail , our aim here is to explain why the the scaled young frames @xmath80 appear in the estimation problem .",
    "the crucial observation is that the young frame @xmath81 is the _ highest weight _ of the representation @xmath30 in the ordering @xmath82 and this ordering is directly related to picking out the fastest growing exponential in certain integrals of the measures @xmath67 .",
    "the integrals we need to study are the laplace transforms of the measures @xmath67 .",
    "we introduce the `` scaled cumulant generating function '' @xmath83 where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the scalar product . if the measures @xmath67 behave like eq .",
    "( [ knexpo ] ) the integrand near @xmath79 behaves like @xmath86 , and the largest contribution comes from the fastest growing exponential : @xmath87 this is an instance of varadhan s theorem @xcite , which has a converse , the grtner - ellis theorem ( * ? ? ? * thm .",
    "ii.6.1 ) : if the limit ( [ cmu ] ) exists , and is differentiable then the estimate in the theorem holds , with the rate function determined from ( [ varadhan ] ) by inverse legendre transformation .",
    "we will follow duffield @xcite by computing the limit ( [ cmu ] ) from group theoretical data .",
    "consider the `` maximally abelian subgroup '' @xmath88 of diagonal matrices @xmath89 for @xmath90 . since these commute , all the operators @xmath91 commute in every representation @xmath30 , and can hence be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "the vectors @xmath92 such that @xmath93 for some non - zero vector @xmath94 are called _ weights _ of the representation @xmath30 .",
    "the dimension @xmath95 of the corresponding eigenspace is called the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath96 .",
    "one particular weight ( with multiplicity one ) is the young frame @xmath31 itself ( interpreted as an element of @xmath36 ) and it turns out that @xmath31 is the maximum ( the `` heighest weight '' ) among all weights of @xmath30 , in the @xmath82-ordering from equation ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "representation theory of semisimple lie algebras @xcite shows that each irreducible , analytic representation of @xmath20 is uniquely characterized ( up to unitary equivalence ) by its highest weight @xmath31 .    in order to estimate the integral ( [ cmu ] )",
    ", we need the quantities @xmath97 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is non - singular , i.e. , an element of @xmath20 . by equation ( [ eq:2 ] )",
    "we have @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the _ character _ of the representation @xmath30 . since @xmath100 is unitarily invariant ( @xmath101 ) we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath1 is diagonal and its matrix elements are arranged in descending order . using the notation from equation ( [ eq:14 ] )",
    "this assumption reads @xmath102 hence we can express @xmath103 in terms of the weights of @xmath30 : @xmath104 where the sum is taken over all weights @xmath96 of @xmath30 . since @xmath105 and @xmath106 for",
    "all @xmath96 we see that @xmath107 is the largest exponential .",
    "we therefore estimate @xmath108 we will combine this with the consequence of weyl s dimension formula that @xmath109 is bounded above by a polynomial @xmath110 in @xmath0 , uniformly in @xmath31 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.2 ) .",
    "hence , for any @xmath111 the two expressions @xmath112 are asymptotically equivalent in the sense that @xmath113 . in the same sense we can continue the chain of equivalences @xmath114 hence , if @xmath115 are the eigenvalues of a non - singular density operator , we get for eq .",
    "( [ cmu ] ) the expression @xmath116 it is then a simple calculus exercise to verify the above rate function as the legendre transform @xmath117 .    this concludes our sketch of proof . in order to expand it into a full proof",
    ", one needs to extend the computation of @xmath118 to @xmath119 , and prove that this extension has the required regularity properties for the application of the grtner - ellis theorem cited above .",
    "this has been carried out by duffield @xcite in a context which is on the one hand wider , because it includes tensor powers of much more general representations of semisimple lie groups , but on the other hand is narrower , because it contains only the case @xmath120 of our theorem .",
    "however , one can extend duffield s result by multiplying his measures @xmath67 with the factor @xmath121 , and using for this factor the estimate  ( [ eq:15 ] ) .",
    "although the estimate we discuss is asymptotically exact , it is not at all clear whether and in what sense it might be _ optimal _ , even for finite @xmath0 . we have experimented with various figures of merit for estimation and found different `` optimal '' estimators for low @xmath0 , rarely coinciding with the @xmath33 determined by ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "it is also not at all clear how much could be gained by optimization here .",
    "an interesting extension will also be the construction of estimators for the full density operator .",
    "it is very suggestive to compose this out of the above estimator for the spectrum , and to use for each young frame a covariant observable to estimate the eigenbasis of @xmath1 .",
    "the density of the covariant observable might be based on the highest weight vector of @xmath30 .",
