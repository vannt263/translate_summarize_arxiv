    "modal quantum theory , or mqt , is a simplified mathematical model having many affinities with the hilbert space structure actual quantum theory ( aqt ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , though the state space in mqt may be discrete and lacks an inner product , it is nevertheless possible to give a usable interpretation of the model based on the `` modal '' distinction between _ possible _ and _ impossible _ measurement outcomes .",
    "mqt systems have superposition and interference effects , and entangled systems have properties that are inconsistent with local hidden variable theories .    in this paper",
    ", we show that mqt also supports analogues of two important results from actual quantum theory , namely the kochen - specker argument about contextuality and hidden variable theories @xcite , and the conway - kochen `` free will theorem '' about the properties of entangled systems @xcite . in each case , the proof of the mqt version of the theorem is substantially simpler .",
    "we are not giving new proofs of these important results in aqt , but rather deriving analogue results in mqt , a very different theory . to emphasize this ,",
    "we show that the predictions of mqt can not always be emcompassed by a probabilistic theory such as aqt",
    ".    the basic rules of mqt are easy to summarize",
    ".    states .",
    ": :    the state of a system is a non - zero vector    @xmath0 in a vector space    @xmath1 over a field    @xmath2 of scalars .",
    "@xmath2 may be any field ; many    interesting examples arise when @xmath2    is chosen to be finite .",
    "effets and measurements .",
    ": :    an effect is an element @xmath3 in the    dual space @xmath4 .",
    "the effect    @xmath3 is possible for the state    @xmath0 if    @xmath5 and    impossible if    @xmath6 .",
    "a    measurement is a basis for    @xmath4 whose elements    correspond to the potential results of the measurement process .",
    "composite systems . : :    if two systems have state spaces    @xmath7 and    @xmath8 , then the    composite system has a state space    @xmath9 .",
    "time evolution .",
    ": :    the time evolution of the state of an isolated system in mqt is    described by an invertible linear operator @xmath10 :    @xmath11    for finite @xmath2 , this evolution can not    be continuous in time .",
    "( the time evolution rule is included here for completeness ; we will require only the first three for our discussion . )",
    "let us illustrate these rules by considering a system with @xmath12 , a `` modal bit '' or _",
    "mobit_. the dual space contains at least three distinct non - zero vectors , which we can designate @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "( for the simplest case , when @xmath16 , these are in fact the only three non - zero vectors in @xmath4 . )",
    "any pair of these forms a basis for @xmath4 , and thus represents a possible measurement on the system .",
    "we shall call the three measurement bases @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and designate the two potential results for each measurement by @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "thus , @xmath22 these are shown in figure  [ fig : mobitbases ] .",
    ", width=144 ]",
    "kochen and specker @xcite considered a single spin-1 system in aqt together with measurements of the squares of spin components along various axes .",
    "these measurements have three important properties :    * the possible results of any measurement are 0 and 1 ( in units of @xmath23 ) . * the squared spin components along any three orthogonal directions are compatible observables and thus may be measured simultaneously . *",
    "if the squared spin components along three orthogonal directions are measured , then exactly two of these directions will yield the result 1 and one direction will yield 0 .",
    "we can view the collection of squared spin components along an orthogonal triad of directions as a single observable , whose result is the particular direction along which the measurement yields 0 .",
    "each possible result corresponds to a projection effect operator on the spin 1 hilbert space .",
    "the orthogonal triad of directions ( in real space ) gives rise to a set of projections onto orthogonal one - dimensional subspaces ( in hilbert space ) .",
    "kochen and specker asked whether the behavior of the spin-1 system could be explained by a hidden - variable model .",
    "in such a model , the result of any measurement would be predetermined by the values of one or more hidden variables , whose underlying statistical distribution would give rise to the the observed probabilistic properties of the quantum system .",
    "kochen and specker further required that the hidden - variable predictions be _ non - contextual_. that is , for a particular effect ",
    "whether or not the squared spin component is 0 for a given direction  the hidden - variable `` yes / no '' prediction can not depend on which other two directions are included in the orthogonal triad that is being measured .",
    "could such a model of non - contextual hidden variables account for the properties of spin-1 systems listed above ?",
    "the question can be translated into a question of graph - coloring .",
    "given some set of directions in real three - dimensional space , can we color those directions red ( for 1 ) and green ( for 0 ) such that any orthogonal triad of directions contains exactly two red and one green ?",
    "kochen and specker showed that this was not in general possible .",
    "they found a set of 117 directions in space that could not be colored in this way , since each direction was part of more than one orthogonal triad .",
    "( later proofs of the theorem , such as the one given in @xcite , reduce the number of directions required , but all such constructions remain fairly complicated . )    we can construct an analogue of the kochen - specker argument in mqt , showing that the predictions of this theory are also incompatible with non - contextual hidden variables . consider the three mobit measurements listed in equation  [ eq : xyzbases ] and diagrammed in figure  [ fig : mobitbases ] . in a hidden - variable model for this system",
    ", the results of all measurements are predetermined by the hidden variables , but because the values of these variables are unknown , more than one result may be deemed possible in a given situation .",
    "the requirement of non - contextuality is that the hidden variables determine whether or not a given effect will occur , independent of what other effects are included in the measurement .",
    "that is , the hidden - variable `` yes / no '' prediction is a function only of the effect and not of the measurement basis to which that effect belongs .",
    "therefore , our question is once again translated into a graph - coloring problem .",
    "consider the triangle in figure  [ fig : mobitbases ] .",
    "each vertex is an effect , and each side corresponds to a measurement basis .",
    "we wish to color the vertices red and green so that each side contains exactly one green vertex .",
    "this is obviously impossible .",
    "therefore , the properties of a mobit system in mqt can not be explained by an model of non - contextual hidden variables .",
    "the essential idea is the same , both in the kochen - specker proof in aqt and in its mqt analogue .",
    "however , the construction in mqt is almost trivial , in sharp contrast to that of kochen and specker .",
    "conway and kochen have used the kochen - specker construction to prove the remarkable `` free will theorem '' about entangled quantum systems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this theorem links the freedom of observers to choose their measurements to the `` free will '' ( indeterminacy ) displayed by quantum systems in producing the outcomes of those measurements .",
    "conway and kochen introduce three basic axioms for the physical world , which they designate spin , twin and fin .",
    "the spin axiom states that spin-1 quantum systems behave as we have described in the last section .",
    "the twin axiom describes the correlations between two spin-1 systems in a `` singlet '' ( total spin zero ) state . in this entangled quantum state",
    ", measurements of the squared spin components along two parallel directions must always yield identical results .",
    "the fin axiom states that the speed of information transfer has a finite limit ( which might be , but is not necessarily , the speed of light ) .",
    ", width=384 ]    consider two measurement processes on spatially separated subsystems , as shown in a spacetime diagram in figure  [ fig : spacelike ] .",
    "the two measurements are nearly simultaneous , and so by the fin axiom it is not possible for information to travel from one measurement to the other .",
    "this means that the result of the measurement on system ( 1 ) can only depend on physical conditions within the causal past of the measurement , shown as the shaded region in figure  [ fig : spacelike ] .",
    "the `` free will '' of observers means that we can arrange the choice of system ( 2 ) measurement to lie entirely outside the causal past of the system ( 1 ) measurement , so the system ( 1 ) result can not depend on this choice .",
    "the reverse is also true .",
    "these facts are the only consequences of the fin axiom that are used in the proof of the free will theorem . because of this , in a later version of the theorem conway and kochen replace the fin axiom with a weaker axiom ( called min ) that asserts the independence of measurement results from distant measurement choices @xcite .",
    "the mqt version of the free will theorem is based on the properties of an entangled state of two mobits .",
    "if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are a pair of basis states , this state can be written means that the second term is multiplied by the additive inverse of the scalar 1 . if @xmath16 , then @xmath26 , and we have @xmath27 . ]",
    "@xmath28 this state has the property that , if measurements are made on the two mobit systems , the same effect can never occur for both systems .",
    "this is because , for any effect @xmath3 , @xmath29 let @xmath30 denote the situation in which a measurement of @xmath31 on system ( 1 ) yields result @xmath32 and a measurement of @xmath33 on system ( 2 ) yields result @xmath34 .",
    "then for the state @xmath35 , any joint result of the form @xmath36 is impossible .",
    "the impossible results include : @xmath37 recalling the three measurement bases in equation  [ eq : xyzbases ] , we see that the following joint results are also impossible for @xmath35 : @xmath38    we are now ready to state the mqt version of the three conway - kochen axioms .",
    "the fin axiom ( or its minimal replacement min ) is retained without change .",
    "the mqt version of spin ( which we may denote spin * ) asserts the existence of the three overlapping measurement bases @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 shown in figure  [ fig : mobitbases ] .",
    "the mqt twin * axiom states that a possible state of the system has the properties of the mqt state @xmath35that is , that the joint results listed in equations  [ eq : xximpossible ] and [ eq : xyimpossible ] are impossible .",
    "now we are ready to prove our theorem .",
    "assume that fin ( or min ) , spin * and twin * hold for a composite system .",
    "suppose also that observers are freely able to choose @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 measurements on the separated subsystems .",
    "now imagine that the actual results of all measurements are fully determined by physical factors in the causal pasts of those measurements .",
    "if the measurements @xmath39 and @xmath40 are made , then the results can not agree .",
    "the only two possible joint results are @xmath41 or @xmath42 . without loss of generality ( since the two situations are symmetric ) , suppose the actual result is the first of these .",
    "if the measurement on system ( 2 ) is @xmath43 instead , then the result of the @xmath39 measurement is unchanged , and we have @xmath44 for some @xmath45 . according to equation  [ eq : xyimpossible ] , the only possible joint result is @xmath46 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that @xmath47 for any choice of measurement on system ( 1 ) .",
    "given that @xmath41 , what if the measurement on system ( 1 ) is actually @xmath48 ? the @xmath40 result is unchanged , and equation  [ eq : xyimpossible ] tells us that only one @xmath48 result is possible .",
    "we must have @xmath49 . from here",
    ", we can inquire how things change if we alter the system ( 2 ) measurement to @xmath43 . again",
    ", the @xmath48 result can not change , and equation  [ eq : xyimpossible ] restricts us to the single possible joint result @xmath50 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that @xmath51 for any choice of measurement on system ( 1 ) .",
    "this contradicts our previous conclusion about @xmath43 .    our hypothesis that the actual results of the measurements are predetermined is therefore faulty .",
    "given the axioms fin ( or min ) , spin * and twin * , the freedom of the observers to perform @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 measurements on the mobits implies that the results of those measurements are not predetermined by the causal pasts of the systems . if observers in mqt have `` free will '' , then so do the systems they observe .",
    "the proof of the mqt version of the free will theorem has the same structure as the corresponding proof by conway and kochen in aqt . as in the kochen - specker theorem ,",
    "the mathematical construction involved for the mqt version is very much simpler .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the proofs presented here are _ not _ alternate proofs for the kochen - specker and conway - kochen theorems in actual quantum theory . these are proofs of analogous results in modal quantum theory . though mqt has many affinities to aqt , the two are not the same .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that systems in one theory might be able to simulate the other .",
    "for example , it might be that the possibility relations among various measurements in an mqt system could be realized as probabilistic relations among measurements in an appropriately chosen aqt system .",
    "then the mqt proof would apply to the corresponding aqt situation .",
    "however , as we will now show , this can not always be done .",
    "in fact , the possibility relations for an mqt system need not be consistent with _ any _ reasonable assignment of probabilities for the system , much less one derived from aqt .",
    "this illustrates in the most definitive way that modal quantum theory is not reducible to actual quantum theory . on the other hand",
    ", there is a sense in which aqt can be regarded a `` special case '' of mqt with @xmath52 .",
    "the inner product structure of aqt hilbert space motivates us to consider only normalized state vectors , orthonormal measurement bases , and unitary time evolution operators .",
    "all of these are restrictions of the larger class of states , measurements and evolution operators permitted in mqt .",
    "if we consider only the distinction between possible ( @xmath53 ) and impossible ( @xmath54 ) measurement results , then any situation in aqt can be viewed from a modal point of view .",
    "the highly simplified structure of mqt is thus a generalization of some aspects of aqt . as we have seen , it is possible to use this generalized framework to prove analogues to important aqt results about hidden variable models .",
    "the mqt proofs are much easier to understand and can be used to shed light on the essential structure of these theorems .",
