    "despite recent progress in cosmology , very little is still known about the location of baryons in the local universe .",
    "the extraordinary wmap ( _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ) measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies favor a @xmath3-cdm scenario in which the baryon density in the universe amounts to @xmath4 % of the total matter - energy density , with a baryon - to - dark - matter ratio of @xmath5 ( bennet et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "this number agrees well with predictions by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis when combined with light element ratios ( @xmath6 % : burles & tytler , 1998 ) , and also with the actual number of baryons at redshifts larger than 2 in the trees of the ly@xmath7 forest : @xmath8 % ( rauch , 1998 ; weinberg et al . ,",
    "this concordance cosmology represents a major advance .",
    "however , the number of baryons detected in the `` virialized universe '' at @xmath9 ( i.e. stars , neutral hydrogen associated with galaxies , and x - ray emitting gas in clusters ) is more than a factor of 2 smaller than the concordance value , @xmath10 % ( 2@xmath11 ; e.g. fukugita , hogan , & peebles , 1998 ) .",
    "it has also been known since 1959 ( kahn & woltjer , 1959 ) that , locally , more than @xmath12 m@xmath13 are needed to dynamically stabilize our own local group .",
    "so , one fundamental question arises : where have the baryons been hiding for the last @xmath14 gyrs of life of the universe ?",
    "hydrodynamical simulations for the formation of structures in the universe , predict that in the present epoch ( @xmath15 ) , half of the normal baryonic matter in the universe ( the `` missing baryons '' ) is in a tenuous ( overdensities @xmath16 , relative to the mean baryon density in the universe)``warm phase '' ( the so called warm hot intergalactic medium : whim ) , shock - heated to temperatures of @xmath17 k during the continuous process of structure formation ( e.g. hellsten et al . , 1998 ; cen , & ostriker , 1999 ; dav et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "these hot filaments are now detectable with current instruments .",
    "two years ago we reported ( nicastro et al . , 2002 , hereinafter n02 ) the first detection of highly ionized o and ne absorption [ ovii@xmath19 , oviii@xmath20 , neix@xmath21 at redshift consistent with zero , in the _ chandra _ low energy transmission grating ( letg ) spectrum of the blazar pks  2155 - 304 ( fig 1 ) .",
    "= 2.4 in = 2.4 in    detection of li - like oxygen absorption [ ovi@xmath22 was also reported in the far - ultraviolet fuse spectra of this ( sembach et al . , 2000 ; savage et al . , 2000 ; n02 ) and many other lines of sight ( sembach et al . ,",
    "2003 : hereinafter s03 ; savage et al . , 2003 ;",
    "nicastro et al . ,",
    "2003 : hereinafter n03 ) .",
    "the resolution of the fuse spectrometers is about 30 times better than that of the letg , and clearly sufficient to resolve the ovi complex in at least two components : a high velocity ( hv - ovi ) component at @xmath23 to -100 km s@xmath24 , and a narrower and more symmetric low velocity ( lv - ovi ) component at @xmath25 to + 100 km s@xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "3a in n02 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that the uv absorbers ( both , hv and lv ) are incompatible with the x - ray absorbers in the hypothesis of purely collisional ionized gas with typical interstellar medium ( ism ) densities ( solid lines and superimposed 2@xmath11 intervals for the ion abundance ratios ) . however , a single temperature solution ( at t@xmath26 k , dashed vertical line in fig .",
    "2 ) can be found for the hv - ovi and the x - ray absorbers if the volume density of the , mainly collisional ionized , gas is low enough ( i.e. @xmath27 @xmath28 ) to allow photoionization by the extragalactic x - ray background to contribute ( to @xmath14 % at @xmath29 @xmath28 ) to the overall ionization balance in the gas .",
    "this is because the relative population of he - like and h - like ions of o and ne , compared to li - like o , starts rising at relatively lower temperatures ( i.e. t@xmath30 k ) , compared to pure collisional ionization model ( dashed lines and superimposed 2@xmath11 intervals for the ion abundance ratios .",
    "see n02 for further details ) .",
    "= 2.4 in = 2.4 in    this solution implies a baryon volume density of @xmath31 @xmath28 , corresponding to overdensities of @xmath32 relatively to the average baryon density in the universe . assuming homogeneity , and an [ h / o ] ratio of 0.3 solar , this in turn gives a path - length of the absorber along this line of sight of @xmath33 mpc , so locating the absorber in the intergalactic space surrounding the galaxy . assuming a transverse size of this filament of 1 mpc , gives a baryonic mass of @xmath34 m@xmath13 .",
    "inhomogeneity would imply a smaller size of the absorber , and so a lower mass . if , for example , the diffuse intergalactic medium would condensate when approaching the virialized structures of the local group , so mixing up with the ism in the high galactic halo , up to densities of @xmath35 @xmath28 , and if this layer of denser gas provided , say , 75 % of the total observed equivalent baryon column , then the total filament would be about 1 mpc long along the line of sight to pks  2155 - 304 ( i.e. about the distance to m  31 ) , with the dense shell contributing about 10 % to the total mass of about @xmath36 m@xmath13 .",
    "the above solution ( and consequent interpretation ) is , of course , not unique .",
    "the alternative is that the x - ray and the ultraviolet absorbers are independently produced by a multiphase ism ( e.g. heckman et al . , 2002 ) , or by both a hot multiphase ism ( the uv lines ) and a diffuse local group medium or galactic corona ( the bulk of the x - ray lines ) .",
    "the importance of this controversy lies in the total mass implied by the two different interpretations : in one case ( local group whim : lg - whim ) the implied mass is comparable , if not larger , than that of the most massive visible constituents of the local group , with strong implications for the local group dynamics and its stability , while in the galactic scenario the gas mass would add up to a maximum of @xmath37 of the galaxy s mass .",
    "one of the main pieces of evidence supporting the extragalactic solution ( i.e. lg - whim solution ) , is the segregation of the hv - ovi in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) frame .",
    "about 85 % of the lines of sight towards extragalactic sources observed by fuse , show hv - ovi absorption ( s03 ) .",
    "moreover , as demonstrated by n03 , the majority of these absorbers appear to be at rest in the local group standard of rest ( see fig . 2 in n03 ) .",
    "the velocity distribution of these absorbers is highly segregated in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , with all negative - velocity absorbers lying at galactic longitude @xmath38 , and all positive - velocity absorbers lying in the opposite hemisphere ( fig . 2 in n03 ) .",
    "this particular distribution is expected for objects at rest in the intergalactic space surrounding our galaxy , with the kinematics in the lsr being an effect of the rotation of the sun in the galaxy s plane .",
    "this suggestion is confirmed by the progressive reduction of the degree of segregation ( and so of the amplitude of the average velocity vector ) of the hv - ovi absorbers for translations of the velocity vectors into the galactic standard of frame ( gsf ) and the local group standard of frame ( lgsr ) . in the lgsr",
    "the hv - ovi distribution appears random , and the amplitude of the average velocity vector is close to the fuse resolution % confidence level . ] .",
    "n03 concluded that the hv - ovi absorbers are at rest in the local group and so trace either a very extended galactic corona ( galactocentric distances @xmath39 kpc ) or a lg - whim filament ( see also wakker , 2003 , these proceedings ) .",
    "s03 have argued against this interpretation .",
    "they noted that the above evidence is a necessary , but not sufficient condition to prove the lg - whim origin of the majority of the hv - ovi .",
    "while we certainly agree with this point , we want to stress here that their main argument against the lg - whim interpretation is the wide correspondence between some of the structures traced by the hv - ovi in the sky , and similar complexes seen in the hydrogen high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) distribution , and thought to be at distances of few kpc from the galaxy center .",
    "however , both n03 and s03 were able to tentatively identify ( based on very generous spatial and kinematics associations : up to tens of degrees in space and hundred km s@xmath24 in velocity ) only about 18 - 20 % of the hv - ovi with hvcs with known or estimated galactocentric distance .",
    "these objects have not been considered in the statistical analysis presented by n03 . for several other hv - ovi in their sample ,",
    "s03 claim the association with known hvc structures ( i.e. the magellanic stream , complex c , complex a ) , only on the base of the vicinity ( few degrees or tens of degrees apart ) of these absorbers with the above hvcs structures .      incredibly high quality _ chandra _ and/or _ newton_-xmm grating spectra are needed to detect x - ray absorption lines with typical whim intensities ( i.e. ew(@xmath40 ) @xmath41 m ) .",
    "the letg spectrum of the blazar pks  2155 - 304 ( n02 ) was collected with an exposure of 60 ks , and during a powerful source outburst ( @xmath42 mcrab @xmath43 erg s@xmath24 @xmath44 ) .",
    "this guarranteed us about 700 counts per resolution element at the wavelength of the ovii@xmath45 line , enough to detect absorption lines with ew@xmath46 m , at a significance larger than 3@xmath11 . unfortunately , however , the flux level of pks  2155 - 304 during this observation , was about 10 - 20 times that of the brightest nearby extragalactic sources in their quiescent levels .",
    "very long exposures are then normally needed to obtain a sizeable signal - to - noise selected sample of x - ray spectra of extragalactic sources , suitable to study the distribution of the highly ionized x - ray absorbers at @xmath47 . to date",
    ", only 5 extragalactic sources have such good quality spectra : pks  2155 - 304 , mkn  421 , 3c  273 , ngc  4593 and ngc  5548 .",
    "all of them show ovii@xmath45 absorption with similar intensities ( i.e. about 10 - 20 m : n02 , rassmussen et al . , 2003 , fang et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "despite efforts to look for galactic ( or between the galaxy and the two magellanic clouds ) hv - ovi or highly ionized x - ray absorbers , none has been found yet .",
    "we searched the literature for reports of , non - intrinsic , highly ionized ( i.e. ovii , oviii or neix ) absorbers at lsr velocity consistent with @xmath48 km s@xmath24 , in the x - ray grating spectra of binaries either in our galaxy or in the two magellanic clouds , and could not find any .",
    "we found about a dozen published _ chandra _ and/or _ newton_-xmm observations of x - ray binaries .",
    "in few cases variable ( i.e. intrinsic ) highly ionized emission and/or absorption , have been detected ( e.g. ness et al .",
    ", 2003 , apj , 594 , l127 ) .",
    "the remaining do not show any high ionization absoprption line either intrinsic or due to intervening ism .",
    "the situation is even clearer in the fuv .",
    "zsarg , et al . , (",
    "2003 ) report no detection of hv - ovi against any of the 22 o - b stars observed by fuse in the galactic halo .",
    "they also note that `` if hv - ovi absorption was as common toward halo stars as toward extragalactic sources , one would expect 10 - 12 detections of hv - ovi absorption in '' their `` sample '' .",
    "they further note that this evidence `` is very important because it justifies the association of the thick - disk ovi with the low - velocity gas '' . while we definitely agree with this conclusion",
    ", we also think that the above evidence directly suggests the association of the hv - ovi with extragalactic gas .",
    "howk , sembach & savage ( 2003 ) also report no detection of hv - ovi in the first 10 kpc , along the line of sight to the globular cluster m  3 .",
    "finally , only galactic ( i.e. low - velocity ) ovi absorption , or ovi absorption at the velocity of the two magellanic clouds , is detected against samples of o - b stars in the two clouds ( danforth et al .",
    ", 2002 ; hoopes et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the few exceptions have galactic explanation ( i.e. a supernova remnant in our galaxy , along the line of sight to av  229 ) .",
    "one of the strongest arguments against the lg - whim interpretation for the hv - ovi and the x - ray absorbers , is the evidence that , along some lines of sight ( i.e. pks  2155 - 304 , mkn  509 : sembach et al . , 1999 ) , the hv - ovi have lower ionization counterparts ( si ii / iii / iv and c ii / iii / iv ) , with similar centroid velocity .",
    "this is not compatible with an homogeneous , diffuse and very tenuous whim surrounding our galaxy , and producing the x - ray and the hv - ovi absorption .",
    "one possibility is therefore that the different absorptions are produced by a multiphase ism , with typical ism densities .",
    "however , inhomogeneities in the lg - whim could also easily give rise to a multiphase medium .",
    "the most efficient source of cooling in a line emitting plasma at t@xmath49 k , is the ovi@xmath50 doublet .",
    "this mechanism is quite inefficient at typical whim densities , giving e - folding cooling times of 80 gyrs , i.e. larger than the hubble time .",
    "such a lg - whim obviously could not have had time to cool down to temperatures typical of the observed low - ionization species .",
    "however , an increase by a factor of 100 in density in compressed layers in proximity of the virialized structures of the local group , would reduce the cooling time to about 800 myrs , about 2/25 the galaxy s age .",
    "so , these denser layers of lg - whim , would have had time to cool down and produce the observed lower ionization species . moreover , in the local group scenario , the velocity of the absorber in the lsr , is mainly due to our rotational motion in the galaxy .",
    "so , along a given line of sight , any layer ( either mpc- or kpc - thick ) would produce absorption lines with roughly the same velocity in the lsr .",
    "the profile , however , would be different , depending mainly on the size of the absorber along the line of sight .",
    "this seems to agree with the profiles observed in low and high - ionization lines .",
    "while evidence for the @xmath0 filament is quite robust both in the fuv and in x - rays , until very recently there had been no clear detection in the x - rays of ovii - oviii whim absorption at @xmath2 ( either associated with the few known intervening ovi - savage , tripp , & lu , 1998 ; tripp , savage , & jenkins , 2000 ; tripp & savage , 2000 ; jenkins et al . , 2003 - or faint - i.e. non - damped - h ly@xmath7 systems in the fuv , or at independent redshifts ) .",
    "the deepest observation of one of the brightest quasars at @xmath51 ( the 500 ks letg observation of h  1821 + 643 ) is sensitive only to ew@xmath52 m(at @xmath53 level ) , and only 2 - 3 low - significance ( @xmath54 ) detections of such systems have actually been claimed ( mathur , weinberg , & chen . ,",
    "2003 ) along that line of sight , consistently with expectations .",
    "this is mostly due to the intrinsic steepness of the logn - log(ew) of the whim ovii - oviii absorption lines , at relatively large ew ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "4 in hellsten et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "a single ovii k@xmath7 system with @xmath55 m  is expected along a random line of sight , up to @xmath56 .",
    "this number rises to 8 , for only twice weaker systems ( ew@xmath57 m ) .",
    "very high signal to noise _ chandra_-letg or _",
    "newton_-xmm rgs spectra of extragalactic sources are therefore needed to detect the whim .",
    "these can be provided with either multi - megasecond observations of a single line of sight , or observing blazars when they undergo an outburst phase .",
    "we decided to pursue this second strategy , and during the past year triggered two target - of - opportunity observations ( toos ) of the blazar mkn 421 ( @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 mpc , de vaucouleurs , et al . , 1991 ) , during two exceptionally high flux outburst phases .",
    "the two observations were carried out with the _ chandra _ acis - letg ( 2002 , october 26 - 27 ) and the hrc - letg ( 2003 , july , 1 - 2 ) , lasted 100 ks each , and reported 0.5 - 2 kev fluxes of 100 and 40 mcrab , respectively .",
    "this allowed us to collect more than 10 million counts in the coadded first order spectrum , and more than 6000 counts per resolution element at 21.6  . in turn , this guaranteed a 3@xmath11-sensitivity of @xmath60 @xmath44 , more than an order of magnitude fainter than the lg - whim . between the two chandra too observations , mkn  421 has also been observed by fuse , following our request of a too .",
    "several absorption lines are clearly detected in the _ chandra _ spectrum of mkn  421 ( fig .",
    "3a : left panel ) , from the relatively strong ovii k@xmath7 line from the lg - whim at @xmath61   down to the ovii k@xmath7 line at the source redshift ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "our preliminary analysis suggests the identification of these lines with 3 different absorbers , one of which ( @xmath62  , @xmath63 @xmath44 ) a truly intervening whim system at @xmath64 , close and the ovii@xmath45 systems are shifted in velocity by @xmath65 km s@xmath24 , which supports the existence of multiphase whim . ] to the redshift of a known weak hydrogen ly@xmath7 system ( shull , stocke , & penton , 1996 ) .",
    "upper limits ( at @xmath66 ) of @xmath67 @xmath44 and @xmath68 @xmath44 are also set on the oviii k@xmath7 ( fig .",
    "3b : right panels ) and ovi@xmath50 transitions from this system . based on these measurements",
    "we estimate a temperature of the intervening whim ovii filament of @xmath69 k , centered around the peak of the temperature distribution of the whim ( e.g. dav et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "the number of ovii filaments per unit redshifts of @xmath70 , derived from this single detection , is in good agreement with expectations from hydrodynamical simulations ( hellsten et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "this is at least twice as much as the corresponding number for ovi ( @xmath71 , tripp , 2003 , private communication ) , and so by far the largest reservoir of baryons in the local universe ."
