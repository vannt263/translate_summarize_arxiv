    "the high-@xmath1 cuprates exhibit peculiar behavior when underdoped : the density - of - states is depleted at low energies , as if some of the degrees of freedom of the system were developing a gap .",
    "this behavior , observed in optical conductivity,@xcite nmr,@xcite angle - resolved photoemission , @xcite @xmath2-axis tunneling,@xcite and specific heat measurements,@xcite was dubbed the ` pseudogap ' .",
    "the emergence of the ` pseudogap ' mimics somewhat the impoverishment of the low - energy excitation spectrum which accompanies the development of @xmath0 superconductivity and resembles , more generally , the type of gap formation which is concomitant with a large class of order parameters .",
    "however , it does not  at first glance  appear to be connected with the formation of an ordered state .",
    "consequently , it was initially believed that the pseudogap was a crossover phenomenon , and attempts to describe it depended on various approximate methods of treating states with local , fluctuating order.@xcite    however , it has recently been proposed that the ` pseudogap ' state _ is _ actually a broken - symmetry ordered state , and that the signatures of the order are subtle enough that the state was able to appear incognito.@xcite in ref .  , the @xmath0 density - wave ( ddw ) state @xcite was advanced as a candidate order . the realization that this is a realistic possibility has led to a re - examination of the experimental circumstances .",
    "elastic _ neutron scattering experiments , which directly probe the symmetries broken by ddw order  time - reversal and translation by one lattice spacing  appear to have observed it.@xcite a number of other experiments are consistent with the proposal,@xcite especially measurements of the superfluid density as a function of doping.@xcite    the experimental situation seems promising , which is strong incentive to reconsider the theoretical state of affairs .",
    "if the ` pseudogap ' state is , indeed , an ordered state , then we should be able to study it within mean - field theory , as we would study the antiferromagnetic state , superconducting state , or any other ordered state .",
    "mean - field theory is unlikely to explain the detailed shape of the phase boundary , but one can hope that it will capture the broad features of the phase diagram , such as its topology and the basic temperature scales . deep within any phase , with @xmath3 and",
    "far from any quantum phase transitions , the mean - field hamiltonian should be the correct hamiltonian , although the parameters in it may need to be renormalized from their mean - field values .",
    "thus it seems natural to simultaneously study the antiferromagnetic ( af ) , @xmath0 -wave superconducting ( dsc ) , and ddw order parameters in mean - field theory . the interplay and possible coexistence of",
    "these orders should be qualitatively and semi - quantitatively explained by mean - field theory .",
    "phase transitions , quantum or thermal , may not be accurately described in their asymptotic limits , but the af , ddw , and dsc phases will , as will possible phases with coexisting af , ddw , and dsc orders .",
    "however , there is an immediate problem faced by such a program .",
    "what microscopic hamiltonian should be used ? in the early days of high-@xmath1 , it was hoped that the important physics of strong local repulsion and superexchange , which is present in the simplest models , such as the hubbard and @xmath4 models , would be sufficient to explain all of the interesting physics of the cuprates .",
    "this appears not to be the case .",
    "monte carlo studies have not found superconductivity in the hubbard model , @xcite while monte carlo calculations , exact diagonalization , and density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) calculations give conflicting results for the @xmath4 model.@xcite dmrg studies have found that the behavior of @xmath5-leg ladders depends sensitively on the strength of , for instance , second - neighbor hopping,@xcite as have monte carlo studies.@xcite indeed , some numerical results are sensitively dependent on boundary conditions,@xcite which is further indication of the instability of many of these models to relatively small changes in the parameters .",
    "furthermore , the physics of charge - ordering is probably not correctly described by the @xmath4 model without near - neighbor ( and possibly long - range ) coulomb repulsion.@xcite indeed , it is also clear from experiments that relatively small changes  such as those associated with substituting nd for la,@xcite which is off the radar screen of the @xmath4 and hubbard models  can radically change at least some aspects of the behavior of these materials . in short , the detailed form of the underlying hamiltonian matters .",
    "fortunately , we are not completely in the dark about the nature of the microscopic hamiltonian . local coulomb repulsion , both on - site and near - neighbor , is clearly an important part of the physics .",
    "this is known from microscopic calculations of the hubbard parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and also from the fact that the undoped parent compounds are antiferromagnetic insulators .",
    "the other important clue  which derives entirely from experiments  is that the cuprates superconduct .",
    "the correct microscopic model ( or models ) must support @xmath8-wave superconductivity when doped away from half - filling .",
    "if the hubbard and @xmath4 do not  and it appears that they do not for @xmath9 small  then they can not describe the cuprates fully .",
    "our strategy will be to take a generalization of the hubbard model which includes next - neighbor repulsion and , most importantly , pair - hopping ( or correlated hopping ) .",
    "the pair - hopping term favors superconductivity .",
    "even when it is relatively small , it stabilizes superconductivity in the hubbard model , as we will see .",
    "there are a variety of ways in which such a term  or another term with similar effect",
    " could arise , either from quantum chemistry @xcite or in the passage to an effective description such as the @xmath4 model ; in both cases , it is essentially a result of strong local coulomb repulsion , as superexchange is . in any event , it appears that such physics is necessary to stabilize superconductivity , so we will incorporate it in our model .",
    "we will find that such a term also leads to ddw order .",
    "to summarize , we consider a model which is chosen so that it incorporates the basic physics of strong local repulsion _ and _ so that will have a phase diagram which includes af at half - filling and dsc at some finite doping .",
    "we find that it naturally supports ddw order . in mean - field theory",
    ", we find a phase diagram in the temperature - doping plane which resembles the experimental phase diagram of the cuprates , with the ddw phase boundary playing the role of the experimental pseudogap onset line .",
    "this ddw line continues into the dsc state , so that the underdoped superconducting state is characterized by both dsc and ddw orders . at low doping , there is also a region of coexistence between af and ddw orders .",
    "we comment on the interpretation of experiments vis -  - vis our findings .",
    "we consider the following bilayer lattice model of interacting electrons : @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the formulas above @xmath13 is hopping with @xmath14 for nearest neighbors , @xmath15 for next nearest neighbors and @xmath16 otherwise .",
    "the other parameters are the tunneling @xmath17 , the on - site repulsion @xmath7 , the nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath18 , and next - nearest - neighbor correlated hopping @xmath19 .",
    "the indices @xmath20 correspond to a lattice site , @xmath21 to the spin , and @xmath22 to the layer .",
    "the next - nearest - neighbor correlated hopping term is physically kinetic , but since it is also quartic , we are going to treat it as interaction .",
    "it hops an electron from @xmath23 to @xmath24 when @xmath24 is vacated by an electron hopping to @xmath25 .",
    "these two hops are correlated by virtue of coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "the presence of this term in the cuprates has been shown in band - structure calculations.@xcite correlated hopping has been discussed in refs .   as a possible mechanism of superconductivity , but it has also been found@xcite that it favors ddw order as well .",
    "the tunneling term is momentum conserving.@xcite we consider a cuo@xmath26 bilayer because the pseudogap has been best characterized in bilayer materials such as ybco and bi2212 .    to derive a mean - field theory , it is convenient to take the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lattice_model ] ) and regroup the terms",
    ". this task would be particularly simple if there were only one phase at a given set of parameters .",
    "for example , a ddw reduced hamiltonian would look like @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( the lattice spacing has been set to unit ) and the ddw mean - field coupling constant is    @xmath29    similar values of the mean filed coupling constants can be derived for other phases as well .",
    "thus , for antiferromagnesm , @xmath8-wave superconductivity and @xmath30 charge - density wave we derive : @xmath31    in fact , the interaction part of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h_int ] ) can be further generalized to include the _ interlayer _ coulomb interactions : @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "then for the given interlayer configuration of the order parameters ( antisymmetric for af and ddw and symmetric for dsc ) , the mean field coupling constants become :    @xmath34    for the opposite configuration ( symmetric for af and ddw and antisymmetric for dsc ) the contributions of @xmath35 , @xmath36 would be negative , which is the main reason why such configurations have generally higher energy and are not observed . on the other hand , the fact that five interaction terms produce only three phases means that we can have the same phase diagrams ( corresponding to a given set of @xmath37 s ) for a range of values of the interaction constants . in the following section we will assume that @xmath38 so that each phase diagram will correspond to a unique set of @xmath39 .",
    "the total hamiltonian contains the reduced parts corresponding to these phases as well as the interactions between the order parameters .",
    "however , since we expect @xmath40 to be negative so that the corresponding order parameter is always zero , we will ignore the term corresponding to this phase .",

    "as we can see , in both diagrams the antiferromagnetic transition temperature at half - filling is close to 1000 k. this should be understood as the scale at which two - dimensional antiferromagnetic correlations develop locally . due to the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem , which states that a continuous symmetry can not be broken spontaneously at finite - temperature in @xmath94 , the transition temperature is zero for a single bilayer .",
    "the coupling between different bilayers ( which is not included in our single - bilayer calculation ) stabilizes the antiferromagnetic phase with a transition temperature around 410 k. in lightly - doped cuprates , the presence of impurities causes the misalignment of locally ordered antiferromagnetic clusters , thereby forming a spin glass .",
    "thus , if we interpret our @xmath95 as the scale of local @xmath94 antiferromagnetic order , which could become @xmath96 antiferromagnetic order or spin glass order , then the phase diagrams of figs .",
    "[ fig : pd1 ] and [ fig : pd2 ] are very reasonable , indeed .",
    "experiments might lead us to expect that ddw order would occur in the range of doping between 0.07 and 0.19 .",

    "fig : pd2 and a bit larger than that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd1 ] . the temperature scale for this phase on fig .",
    "[ fig : pd1 ] is very reasonable ; it is almost three times higher on fig .",
    "[ fig : pd2 ] .",
    "this change occurred primarily as a result of the increased value of @xmath19 .",
    "if we further increase @xmath19 to @xmath97 ev , the ddw phase will begin to suppress the af phase and will expand up to half - filling at finite temperatures .",
    "in general , varying the interaction constants by less that 20   30% does not change the phase diagram qualitatively .",
    "however , larger variations lead to completely different classes of phase diagrams , such as those with the af phase suppressed or without a ddw phase at all .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : pd3 ] shows the case when due to the smaller value of correlation hopping , both ddw and dsc phases disappear and only af phase remains in the diagram .",

    "@xmath101  ev , @xmath102  ev.),width=312 ]    the dsc phase occupies a doping range away from half - filling primarily as a result of band structure effects associated with the bilayer splitting . in the absence of other orders",
    ", it would extend all the way to half - filling , but it is suppressed at low doping by ddw and af order . in a more realistic calculation , superconductivity would be suppressed close to half - filling by no - double - occupancy constraint , i.e. by strong local coulomb repulsion",
    ". however , the dsc phase never even makes it that close to half - filling because the ddw phase intervenes .",
    "an important feature common to both diagrams is the existence of regions with two simultaneous kinds of order .",
    "namely , there is a region with ddw+af order and a region with ddw+dsc order .",
    "the system is an insulator in the af state at half - filling , a metal in the ddw and ddw+af states , and a superconductor in the dsc and ddw+dsc states .",
    "all of the transitions are of second order at the mean - field level because of the signs of the @xmath103 couplings between the order parameters in the ginzburg - landau theory eq .",
    "( [ eqn : landau - ginzburg ] ) .",
    "the calculated dependence of the chemical potential @xmath104 on the doping @xmath105 inside the ddw phase and in its proximity is nonmonotonic .",
    "this is due to the rapid development of the ddw gap , which causes the chemical potential to be lower than in the normal state .",
    "the thermodynamic inequality @xmath106 implies that when this is violated , mean - field theory should be corrected using maxwell s construction , which signals that fluctuations drive the transitions first - order as a function of @xmath104 .",
    "consequently , we would expect the underdoped side of the dsc phase to be characterized by a smaller than expected chemical shift , as has been observed.@xcite a first - order phase transition as a function of chemical potential is manifested as phase separation in a two - phase coexistence region spanning a range of dopings when the doping is held fixed instead .",
    "it has been argued that such phase separation will be precluded by coulomb interactions , thereby leading to stripe formation.@xcite",
    "we have studied the phase diagram of a bilayer lattice model using mean field theory .",
    "since we have focused on ordered phases , this should be a valid approximation .",
    "we found that for certain ranges of the values of the interaction constants the phase diagram agrees well with the experimentally observed phase diagram of ybco if the ` pseudogap ' is associated with ddw order .",
    "the diagram remains in qualitative agreement with the experimental data when the parameters of our model vary by less than 20   30% and becomes qualitatively different for larger variations .",
    "clearly , such a phase diagram is reasonably robust , but is hardly inevitable .",
    "this is reassuring because high - temperature superconductivity is stable , but only appears in a special class of materials ( to the best of our current knowledge ) .",
    "there are some systematic errors associated with mean - field theory , on which we now comment .",
    "it underestimates the effect of fluctuations .",
    "thus , the nel temperature is very large in mean - field theory , while it should actually be zero in any strictly two - dimensional system .",
    "however , the nel temperature which we find should be regarded as the temperature below which a renormalized classical description is valid.@xcite the nel temperature observed in experiments is associated with the crossover from 2d to 3d .",
    "mean - field theory also overestimates the coupling which drives antiferromagnetism , which it takes to be essentially @xmath7 . for small @xmath107 ,",
    "this is correct , but for large @xmath7 , it should be replaced by @xmath108 . indeed , the large-@xmath7 limit is generally somewhat problematic near half - filling since the gutwiller constraint is not enforced in mean - field theory .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry of the ddw and dsc states lead one to the erroneous conclusion that they are completely unaffected by large @xmath7 .",
    "this can not , of course , really be true ; clearly , mean - field theory underestimates the tendency of large-@xmath7 to push these ordered states away from half - filling .",
    "the seemingly small value of @xmath7 taken in our calculation should be interpreted in light of these observations .",
    "other mean - field treatments which incoporate strong local coulomb repulsion more prominently have also found ddw order in a generalization of the @xmath4 model @xcite and in the hubbard model with nearest neighbor attraction.@xcite    we find that the scale associated with superconductivity is largely determined by the strength of correlated hopping . at the moment , this is rather _ ad hoc _ , but we had little choice but to introduce some term of this sort in order to have a phase diagram which includes superconductivity .",
    "it is possible that the superexchange coupling @xmath109 plays a more important role than we have accorded it in setting @xmath1 , but superexchange is beyond a mean - field treatment .    as we have seen , the very term which stabilizes superconductivity also supports the development of ddw order .",
    "one way of interpreting our results begins with the observation that the ddw order parameter , when combined with the real and imaginary parts of the dsc order parameter form a triplet under an @xmath110 group of transformations.@xcite if this ` pseudospin ' @xmath111 ) is a symmetry of the hamiltonian , then ddw and dsc orders will be equally favored .",
    "thus , one can envision that the important order - producing term in the hamiltonian is @xmath110-symmetric while small symmetry - breaking terms drive the system into either the ddw or dsc states .",
    "our result shows that pair - hopping is of this form .",
    "are all physically reasonable mechanisms for @xmath0 superconductivity similarly invariant under pseudospin @xmath110 ?",
