    "the kinetic theory of gases was proposed by j. clerk maxwell @xcite and l. boltzmann @xcite in the second half of the xixth century . because the existence of atoms , on which kinetic theory rested , remained controversial for some time , it was not until many years later , in the xxth century , that the tools of kinetic theory became of common use in various branches of physics such as neutron transport , radiative transfer , plasma and semiconductor physics ...    besides , the arguments which maxwell and boltzmann used in writing what is now known as the ",
    "boltzmann collision integral \" were far from rigorous  at least from the mathematical viewpoint . as a matter of fact",
    ", the boltzmann equation itself was studied by some of the most distinguished mathematicians of the xxth century  such as hilbert and carleman  before there were any serious attempt at deriving this equation from first principles ( i.e. molecular dynamics . ) whether the boltzmann equation itself was viewed as a fundamental equation of gas dynamics , or as some approximate equation valid in some well identified limit is not very clear in the first works on the subject  including maxwell s and boltzmann s .",
    "it seems that the first systematic discussion of the validity of the boltzmann equation viewed as some limit of molecular dynamics  i.e. the free motion of a large number of small balls subject to binary , short range interaction , for instance elastic collisions  goes back to the work of h. grad @xcite . in 1975 , o.e .",
    "lanford gave the first rigorous derivation @xcite of the boltzmann equation from molecular dynamics  his result proved the validity of the boltzmann equation for a very short time of the order of a fraction of the reciprocal collision frequency .",
    "( one should also mention an earlier ,  formal derivation \" by c. cercignani @xcite of the boltzmann equation for a hard sphere gas , which considerably clarified the mathematical formulation of the problem . ) shortly after lanford s derivation of the boltzmann equation , r. illner and m. pulvirenti managed to extend the validity of his result for all positive times , for initial data corresponding with a very rarefied cloud of gas molecules @xcite .",
    "an important assumption made in boltzmann s attempt at justifying the equation bearing his name is the  stosszahlansatz \" , to the effect that particle pairs just about to collide are uncorrelated .",
    "lanford s argument indirectly established the validity of boltzmann s assumption , at least on very short time intervals .    in applications of kinetic theory other than rarefied gas dynamics",
    ", one may face the situation where the analogue of the boltzmann equation for monatomic gases is linear , instead of quadratic .",
    "the linear boltzmann equation is encountered for instance in neutron transport , or in some models in radiative transfer .",
    "it usually describes a situation where particles interact with some background medium  such as neutrons with the atoms of some fissile material , or photons subject to scattering processes ( rayleigh or thomson scattering ) in a gas or a plasma .    in some situations leading to a linear boltzmann equation , one has to think of two families of particles : the moving particles whose phase space density satisfies the linear boltzmann equation , and the background medium that can be viewed as a family of fixed particles of a different type .",
    "for instance , one can think of the moving particles as being light particles , whereas the fixed particles can be viewed as infinitely heavier , and therefore unaffected by elastic collisions with the light particles . before lanford s fundamental paper , an important  unfortunately unpublished  preprint by g. gallavotti",
    "@xcite provided a rigorous derivation of the linear boltzmann equation assuming that the background medium consists of fixed , independent like hard spheres whose centers are distributed in the euclidian space under poisson s law .",
    "gallavotti s argument already possessed some of the most remarkable features in lanford s proof , and therefore must be regarded as an essential step in the understanding of kinetic theory .",
    "however , boltzmann s stosszahlansatz becomes questionable in this kind of situation involving light and heavy particles , as potential correlations among heavy particles may influence the light particle dynamics .",
    "gallavotti s assumption of a background medium consisting of independent hard spheres excluded this this possibility .",
    "yet , strongly correlated background media are equally natural , and should also be considered .",
    "the periodic lorentz gas discussed in these notes is one example of this type of situation . assuming that heavy particles are located at the vertices of some lattice in the euclidian space clearly introduces about the maximum amount of correlation between these heavy particles .",
    "this periodicity assumption entails a dramatic change in the structure of the equation that one obtains under the same scaling limit that would otherwise lead to a linear boltzmann equation .",
    "therefore , studying the periodic lorentz gas can be viewed as one way of testing the limits of the classical concepts of the kinetic theory of gases .",

    "i am also grateful to c. boldighrini and g. gallavotti for illuminating discussions on this subject .",
    "in the early 1900 s , p. drude @xcite and h. lorentz @xcite independently proposed to describe the motion of electrons in metals by the methods of kinetic theory .",
    "one should keep in mind that the kinetic theory of gases was by then a relatively new subject : the boltzmann equation for monatomic gases appeared for the first time in the papers of j. clerk maxwell @xcite and l. boltzmann @xcite .",
    "likewise , the existence of electrons had been established shortly before , in 1897 by j.j .",
    "thomson .",
    "the basic assumptions made by h. lorentz in his paper @xcite can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the population of electrons is thought of as a gas of point particles described by its phase - space density @xmath0 , that is the density of electrons at the position @xmath1 with velocity @xmath2 at time @xmath3 .",
    "electron - electron collisions are neglected in the physical regime considered in the lorentz kinetic model  on the contrary , in the classical kinetic theory of gases , collisions between molecules are important as they account for momentum and heat transfer .",
    "however , the lorentz kinetic theory takes into account collisions between electrons and the surrounding metallic atoms .",
    "these collisions are viewed as simple , elastic hard sphere collisions .",
    "since electron - electron collisions are neglected in the lorentz model , the equation governing the electron phase - space density @xmath4 is linear .",
    "this is at variance with the classical boltzmann equation , which is quadratic because only binary collisions involving pairs of molecules are considered in the kinetic theory of gases .    with the simple assumptions above , h. lorentz arrived at the following equation for the phase - space density of electrons @xmath0 : @xmath5    in this equation , @xmath6 is the lorentz collision integral , which acts on the only variable @xmath2 in the phase - space density @xmath4 . in other words , for each continuous function @xmath7 , one has @xmath8 and the notation @xmath9 the other parameters involved in the lorentz equation are the mass @xmath10 of the electron , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 respectively the density and radius of metallic atoms .",
    "the vector field @xmath13 is the electric force . in the lorentz model , the self - consistent electric force",
    " i.e. the electric force created by the electrons themselves  is neglected , so that @xmath14 take into account the only effect of an applied electric field ( if any ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the self consistent electric field is linear in @xmath4 , so that its contribution to the term @xmath15 would be quadratic in @xmath4 , as would be any collision integral accounting for electron - electron collisions .",
    "therefore , neglecting electron - electron collisions and the self - consistent electric field are both in accordance with assuming that @xmath16 .",
    "the line of reasoning used by h. lorentz to arrive at the kinetic equations above is based on the postulate that the motion of electrons in a metal can be adequately represented by a simple mechanical model  a collisionless gas of point particles bouncing on a system of fixed , large spherical obstacles that represent the metallic atoms .",
    "even with the considerable simplification in this model , the argument sketched in the article @xcite is little more than a formal analogy with boltzmann s derivation of the equation now bearing his name .",
    "this suggests the mathematical problem , of deriving the lorentz kinetic equation from a microscopic , purely mechanical particle model .",
    "thus , we consider a gas of point particles ( the electrons ) moving in a system of fixed spherical obstacles ( the metallic atoms ) .",
    "we assume that collisions between the electrons and the metallic atoms are perfectly elastic , so that , upon colliding with an obstacle , each point particle is specularly reflected on the surface of that obstacle .    undoubtedly , the most interesting part of the lorentz kinetic equation is the collision integral which does not seem to involve @xmath14 .",
    "therefore we henceforth assume for the sake of simplicity that there is no applied electric field , so that @xmath17    in that case , electrons are not accelerated between successive collisions with the metallic atoms , so that the microscopic model to be considered is a simple , dispersing billiard system  also called a sinai billiard . in that model , electrons are point particles moving at a constant speed along rectilinear trajectories in a system of fixed spherical obstacles , and specularly reflected at the surface of the obstacles .",
    "more than 100 years have elapsed since this simple mechanical model was proposed by p. drude and h. lorentz , and today we know that the motion of electrons in a metal is a much more complicated physical phenomenon whose description involves quantum effects .",
    "yet the lorentz gas is an important object of study in nonequilibrium satistical mechanics , and there is a very significant amount of literature on that topic  see for instance @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the first rigorous derivation of the lorentz kinetic equation is due to g. gallavotti @xcite , who derived it from from a billiard system consisting of randomly ( poisson ) distributed obstacles , possibly overlapping , considered in some scaling limit  the boltzmann - grad limit , whose definition will be given ( and discussed ) below .",
    "slightly more general , random distributions of obstacles were later considered by h. spohn in @xcite .    while gallavotti s theorem bears on the convergence of the mean electron density ( averaging over obstacle configurations ) , c. boldrighini , l. bunimovich and ya .",
    "sinai @xcite later succeeded in proving the almost sure convergence ( i.e. for a.e .",
    "obstacle configuration ) of the electron density to the solution of the lorentz kinetic equation .    in any case",
    ", none of the results above says anything on the case of a periodic distribution of obstacles . as we shall see , the periodic case is of a completely different nature  and leads to a very different limiting equation , involving a phase - space different from the one considered by h. lorentz  i.e. @xmath18 ",
    "on which the lorentz kinetic equation is posed .",
    "the periodic lorentz gas is at the origin of many challenging mathematical problems .",
    "for instance , in the late 1970s , l. bunimovich and ya .",
    "sinai studied the periodic lorentz gas in a scaling limit different from the boltzmann - grad limit studied in the present paper . in @xcite",
    ", they showed that the classical brownian motion is the limiting dynamics of the lorentz gas under that scaling assumption  their work was later extended with n. chernov : see @xcite .",
    "this result is indeed a major achievement in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , as it provides an example of an irreversible dynamics ( the heat equation associated with the classical brownian motion ) that is derived from a reversible one ( the lorentz gas dynamics ) .",
    "before discussing the boltzmann - grad limit of the periodic lorentz gas , we first give a brief description of gallavotti s result @xcite for the case of a poisson distribution of independent , and therefore possibly overlapping obstacles .",
    "as we shall see , gallavotti s argument is in some sense fairly elementary , and yet brilliant .",
    "first we define the notion of a poisson distribution of obstacles . henceforth , for the sake of simplicity , we assume a @xmath19-dimensional setting .",
    "the obstacles ( metallic atoms ) are disks of radius @xmath20 in the euclidian plane @xmath21 , centered at @xmath22 . henceforth , we denote by @xmath23    we further assume that the configurations of obstacle centers @xmath24 are distributed under poisson s law with parameter @xmath25 , meaning that @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the surface , i.e. the @xmath19-dimensional lebesgue measure of a measurable subset @xmath28 of the euclidian plane @xmath21 .",
    "this prescription defines a probability on countable subsets of the euclidian plane @xmath21 .",
    "obstacles may overlap : in other words , configurations @xmath29 such that @xmath30 are not excluded .",
    "indeed , excluding overlapping obstacles means rejecting obstacles configurations @xmath24 such that @xmath31 for some @xmath32 . in other words , @xmath33 is replaced with @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is a normalizing coefficient . ) since the term @xmath36 the obstacles are no longer independent under this new probability measure .",
    "next we define the billiard flow in a given obstacle configuration @xmath24 .",
    "this definition is self - evident , and we give it for the sake of completeness , as well as in order to introduce the notation .    given a countable subset @xmath24 of the euclidian plane @xmath21 , the billiard flow in the system of obstacles defined by @xmath24 is the family of mappings @xmath37 defined by the following prescription .    whenever the position @xmath38 of a particle lies outside the surface of any obstacle , that particle moves at unit speed along a rectilinear path : @xmath39 and , in case of a collision with the @xmath40-th obstacle , is specularly reflected on the surface of that obstacle at the point of impingement , meaning that @xmath41v(t-0;x , v,\\{c\\ } ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 $ ] denotes the reflection with respect to the line @xmath43 : @xmath44v = v-2(\\om\\cdot v)\\om\\,,\\quad|\\om|=1\\,.\\ ] ]    then , given an initial probability density @xmath45 on the single - particle phase - space with support outside the system of obstacles defined by @xmath24 , we define its evolution under the billiard flow by the formula @xmath46    let @xmath47 be the sequence of collision times for a particle starting from @xmath1 in the direction @xmath48 at @xmath49 in the configuration of obstacles @xmath24 : in other words , @xmath50\\,|\\,\\hbox{dist}(x(-s , x , v,\\{c\\ } ) ; \\{c\\ } ) = r\\}=j-1\\}\\ , .",

    "defined by the formula @xmath53    in the case of physically admissible initial data , there should be no particle located inside an obstacle .",
    "hence we assumed that @xmath54 in the union of all the disks of radius @xmath20 centered at the @xmath55 . by construction , this condition is obviously preserved by the billiard flow , so that @xmath56 also vanishes whenever @xmath1 belongs to a disk of radius @xmath20 centered at any @xmath55 .",
    "as we shall see shortly , when dealing with bounded initial data , this constraint disappears in the ( yet undefined ) boltzmann - grad limit , as the volume fraction occupied by the obstacles vanishes in that limit .",
    "therefore , we shall henceforth neglect this difficulty and proceed as if @xmath57 were any bounded probability density on @xmath18 .",
    "our goal is to average the summation above in the obstacle configuration @xmath29 under the poisson distribution , and to identify a scaling on the obstacle radius @xmath20 and the parameter @xmath25 of the poisson distribution leading to a nontrivial limit .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 has the following important physical interpretation .",
    "the expected number of obstacle centers to be found in any measurable subset @xmath58 of the euclidian plane @xmath21 is @xmath59 so that @xmath60    the average of the first term in the summation defining @xmath61 is @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 denotes the mathematical expectation ) since the condition @xmath64 means that the tube of width @xmath65 and length @xmath3 contains no obstacle center .        henceforth , we seek a scaling limit corresponding to small obstacles , i.e. @xmath66 and a large number of obstacles per unit volume , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "there are obviously many possible scalings satisfying this requirement . among all these scalings ,",
    "the boltzmann - grad scaling in space dimension @xmath19 is defined by the requirement that the average over obstacle configurations of the first term in the series expansion for the particle density @xmath4 has a nontrivial limit .    in order for the average of the first term above to have a nontrivial limit",
    ", one must have @xmath68    under this assumption @xmath69    gallavotti s idea is that this first term corresponds with the solution at time @xmath3 of the equation @xmath70 that involves only the loss part in the lorentz collision integral , and that the ( average over obstacle configuration of the ) subsequent terms in the sum defining the particle density @xmath4 should converge to the duhamel formula for the lorentz kinetic equation .",

    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "some remarks are in order before leaving gallavotti s setting for the lorentz gas with the poisson distribution of obstacles .    assuming no external force field as done everywhere in the present paper is not as inocuous as it may seem .",
    "for instance , in the case of poisson distributed holes  i.e. purely absorbing obstacles , so that particles falling into the holes disappear from the system forever  the presence of an external force may introduce memory effects in the boltzmann - grad limit , as observed by l. desvillettes and v. ricci @xcite .",

    "after _ having obtained an explicit formula for the solution of that equation . in other words , the equation is deduced from the solution  which is a somewhat unusual situation in mathematics . however , the same is true of lanford s derivation of the boltzmann equation @xcite , as well as of the derivation of several other models in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics . for an interesting comment on this issue ,",
    "see @xcite , on p. 75 .",
    "from now on , we shall abandon the random case and concentrate our efforts on the periodic lorentz gas .",
    "our first task is to define the boltzmann - grad scaling for periodic systems of spherical obstacles . in the poisson case",
    "defined above , things were relatively easy : in space dimension @xmath19 , the boltzmann - grad scaling was defined by the prescription that the number of obstacles per unit volume tends to infinity while the obstacle radius tends to @xmath111 in such a way that @xmath112    the product above has an interesting geometric meaning even without assuming a poisson distribution for the obstacle centers , which we shall briefly discuss before going further in our analysis of the periodic lorentz gas .",
    "perhaps the most important scaling parameter in all kinetic models is the mean free path .",
    "this is by no means a trivial notion , as will be seen below . as suggested by the name itself ,",
    "any notion of mean free path must involve first the notion of free path length , and then some appropriate probability measure under which the free path length is averaged .    for simplicity , the only periodic distribution of obstacles considered below is the set of balls of radius @xmath20 centered at the vertices of a unit cubic lattice in the @xmath113-dimensional euclidian space .",

    "the mean free path is the quantity defined as @xmath125 where the notation @xmath126 designates the average under some appropriate probability measure on @xmath127 .",
    "a first ambiguity in the notion of mean free path comes from the fact that there are two fairly natural probability measures for the lorentz gas .",
    "the first one is the uniform probability measure on @xmath128 @xmath129 that is invariant under the billiard flow  the notation @xmath130 designates the @xmath131-dimensional uniform measure of the unit sphere @xmath132 .",
    "this measure is obviously invariant under the billiard flow @xmath133 defined by @xmath134 while @xmath135v_r(t^- ) \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath136v = v-2v\\!\\cdot\\!nn$ ] denoting the reflection with respect to the hyperplane @xmath137 .",
    "the second such probability measure is the invariant measure of the billiard map @xmath138 where @xmath122 is the unit inward normal at @xmath124 , while @xmath139 is the @xmath131-dimensional surface element on @xmath123 , and @xmath140 the billiard map @xmath141 is the map @xmath142 which obviously passes to the quotient modulo @xmath143-translations : @xmath144 in other words , given the position @xmath1 and the velocity @xmath2 of a particle immediatly after its first collision with an obstacle , the sequence @xmath145 is the sequence of all collision points and post - collision velocities on that particle s trajectory .    with the material",
    "above , we can define a first , very natural notion of mean free path , by setting @xmath146 notice that , for @xmath147-a.e .",

    "now , a very general formula for computing the right - hand side of the above equality was found by the great spanish mathematician l. a. santal in 1942 .",

    "notice that this formula defines @xmath93 for @xmath117 only , as the particle density should remain @xmath111 for all time in the spatial domain occupied by the obstacles .",
    "as explained in the previous section , this is a set whose measure vanishes in the boltzmann - grad limit , and we shall always implicitly extend the function @xmath93 defined above by @xmath111 for @xmath172 .    since @xmath57 is a bounded function on @xmath173 , the family @xmath93 defined above is a bounded family of @xmath174 . by the banach - alaoglu theorem ,",
