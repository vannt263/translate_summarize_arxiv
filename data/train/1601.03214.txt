    "the number of neurons in the human brain is approximately @xmath1 million  @xcite which is roughly half the number of stars in our milky way galaxy .",
    "each of these neurons is connected anywhere between @xmath2 to @xmath0 other neighbouring neurons on an average .",
    "it remains a mystery to a large extent as to how information encoded in action potentials ( spikes ) is transported from one neuron in the middle of a labyrinth of neurons to its immediate neighbour amidst a cacophony of interfering neural signals and neural noise .",
    "the brain not only employs very efficient compression of information with low consumption of energy , but also is known to robustly multiplex neural signals .    in a recent study involving adult rhesus monkeys , single neuron spiking measurements in the lateral intraparietal area ( lip ) showed that decision signals are multiplexed with decision - irrelevant visual signals  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the same study also revealed that neurons in lip exhibit diverse dynamics indicating a broad range of neural computations .",
    "friedrich et al .",
    "@xcite found that oscillatory field potentials in the zebrafish olfactory bulb multiplex information about complimentary stimulus features by the same population of neurons .",
    "these can be retrieved selectively by biologically plausible mechanisms .",
    "panzeri et al .",
    "@xcite present a strong case for temporal multiplexing where neural responses at different timescales encode different stimulus attributes .",
    "they argue that such multiplexing increases encoding capacity of neural responses and offers advantages over single response timescales , thus enabling the brain to arrive at an information - rich and stable representation of an otherwise noisy and variable sensory environment .    in this paper , we propose a phenomenological model to study the feasibility of such efficient multiplexing of neural signals in the presence of neural interference from a very large number of neurons .",
    "we wish to point out the possibility of such mechanisms from a theoretical perspective while trying to use reasonable models which simulate the behaviour of actual neurons . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there are no mathematical models in the neuroscience literature which can explain a mechanism of simultaneous compression , reliable multiplexing and robust demultiplexing of chaotic neural signals ( amidst @xmath0 noisy signals ) which the brain seems to be performing successfully .",
    "we hope to demonstrate via theoretical arguments and simulation results that our proposed compressed sensing model has all the three benefits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review existing methods of multiplexing of chaotic signals and point out their drawbacks in section  [ sec : multiplex ] .",
    "none of these existing methods seem feasible to model multiplexing of chaotic neural signals in the brain .",
    "we propose a novel model of multiplexing ( and demultiplexing ) of chaotic neural signals using the framework of compressed sensing in section  [ sec : proposed ] .",
    "we conclude with future research directions in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "chaos as a possible neuronal code was proposed by researchers in neuroscience owing to enormous experimental evidence of chaos in the nerve cells , neural assemblies , behavioural patterns as well as higher brain functions .",
    "there are several advantages of chaos and nonlinear response models over stochastic ones , especially the possibility of control of the former .",
    "korn et al . , in their excellent review article  @xcite , trace the history of the search for chaos in the nervous system providing pointers to numerous experimental studies .",
    "dynamical approach to brain operations and cognition has been vindicated and there is a large body of compelling evidence of chaos at all levels .",
    "the problem that we wish to address is the ability of neurons to multiplex chaotic signals . to this end ,",
    "we briefly review known methods for multiplexing of chaotic signals .",
    "starting from @xmath3 , continuous time chaotic signals have been multiplexed using the notion of dual synchronization  @xcite .",
    "the idea of dual synchronization proposed by liu and davis  @xcite is to use a scalar signal to simultaneously synchronize two different pairs of chaotic oscillators .",
    "dual synchronization has been implemented in electronic circuits  @xcite , but this has problems such as difficulty of extending to more than two signals , sensitivity to noise and the need to carry two scalar signals for multiplexing more than two signals ( but action potentials are transmitted as just a single scalar signal ) .",
    "even @xmath4 of noise results in a synchronization error of @xmath5 as reported by liu and davis  @xcite .",
    "symbolic dynamics - based approach to multiplex two pairs of low frequency chaotic electronic circuits that produce rssler - like oscillations was demonstrated by blakely and corron  @xcite .",
    "however , even a small synchronization error leads to huge errors thereby making it unsuitable .",
    "nagaraj and vaidya  @xcite proposed multiplexing of discrete chaotic signals in the presence of noise using the idea of symbolic sequence invariance .",
    "while they demonstrate multiplexing up to @xmath6 chaotic signals , their method is not robust to huge amounts of noise and as the number of signals to be multiplexed increases , the noise tolerance comes down quite rapidly .    even if we grant that some of the above methods could be modified to work with multiple chaotic signals , it is not at all obvious whether these can be extended to multiplex neural signals from neuronal models , as it has never been attempted before .",
    "most importantly , these methods would fail to address the problem that we are interested in @xmath7 multiplexing a small number of neural signals amidst @xmath0 competing noisy neural signals from neighbouring neurons .",
    "these methods have never been tested for such large number of signals , but this is precisely what the brain has to contend with .",
    "the problem addressed in this work is stated as follows . given a particular pre - synaptic neuron ( @xmath8 ) and its eastern post - synaptic neighbour ( @xmath9 ) , both of these being connected to @xmath10 other neurons , how does neuron @xmath8 simultaneously transport 4 neural signals @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( corresponding to north , north - west , south - west and south neighbours respectively ) to neuron @xmath9 ? here @xmath15 stands for discrete time index ( we assume a sampled neural signal , but in what follows , our methods can be extended to continuous time signals as well ) .",
    "the neuron @xmath8 can only transmit a single scalar signal across its synapse to neuron @xmath9 .",
    "it is to be remembered that all neural signals are always corrupted with some amount of noise , which we shall assume to be additive gaussian .      at neuron @xmath8 , up to a first order approximation , we shall assume that it forms a weighted addition of all its input noisy neural signals .",
    "this can be mathematically represented as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "equivalently , the above equation could be expressed in matrix form : @xmath18     = \\left [    \\begin{array}{cccc }      { \\rule[-1ex]{0.5pt}{2.5ex } } & { \\rule[-1ex]{0.5pt}{2.5ex } } &         & { \\rule[-1ex]{0.5pt}{2.5ex}}\\\\      s_{1 }     & s_{2 }     & \\ldots & s_{n }     \\\\      { \\rule[-1ex]{0.5pt}{2.5ex } } & { \\rule[-1ex]{0.5pt}{2.5ex } } &         & { \\rule[-1ex]{0.5pt}{2.5ex}}\\end{array } \\right ] \\left [    \\begin{array}{c }      w_1 \\\\      w_2",
    "\\\\      \\vdots\\\\      \\vdots\\\\      \\vdots\\\\      w_n    \\end{array } \\right ] , \\ ] ] which can be further written succinctly as : @xmath19 some points to note :    1 .",
    "it is quite reasonable to assume linear processing of inputs as in the above equation .",
    "for example , the olfactory bulb linearly processes fluctuating odor inputs .",
    "gupta et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that individual mitral / tufted cells ( in anesthetized rats ) sum inputs linearly across odors and time . 2 .   in this work ,",
    "we assume a value of @xmath20 .",
    "it may be the case that there are fewer than @xmath0 neurons connecting to @xmath8 ( and @xmath9 ) .",
    "we have assumed this huge number as a worst - case scenario , but our methods work with lower values of @xmath21 as well .",
    "we shall assume that only a small fraction ( say @xmath22 ) of the @xmath21 neural signals @xmath23 reaching @xmath8 are from neighbouring neurons .",
    "these are chaotic outputs of the hindmarsh - rose neuron model ( described below ) but corrupted with small amounts of additive noise .",
    "hence , this small set of signals ( @xmath22 of the columns of matrix @xmath24 ) is modeled as signal - dominant with low noise ( additive gaussian noise denote a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath25 & variance @xmath26 . ]",
    "@xmath27 ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath28 of the neural signals are completely dominated by additive gaussian noise and are modeled as i.i.d gaussian samples @xmath29 .",
    "even though these vast number of columns of @xmath24 are also neural signals , they are effectively modeled as gaussian noise , since by the time these neural signals arrive at neuron @xmath8 ( as well as @xmath9 - remember that @xmath9 is nearest neighbour of @xmath8 ) , they are dominated completely by noise with no signal component whatsoever .",
    "the weights @xmath30 are scalars ( real - valued ) and correspond to each pre - synaptic neuron of @xmath8 ( these weights could be thought of as contributing to either an inhibitory or an excitatory response ) .",
    "these weights are completely unknown to @xmath9 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that only a few neural signals ( say @xmath31 ) among the @xmath22 signal - dominant columns of @xmath24 ( in our study we have taken @xmath32 ) need to be multiplexed from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "hence , we shall assume that only this @xmath31 sparse set of weights are significant ( greater than some threshold @xmath33 ) , though the actual number of significant weights ( @xmath31 ) itself is unknown at @xmath9 that comes to our rescue . ] .",
    "the hindmarsh - rose neuron model  @xcite is a widely used model for bursting - spiking dynamics of the membrane voltage @xmath34 of a single neuron .",
    "the equations of the model ( in dimensionless form ) are : @xmath35}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above set of differential equations , @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent auxiliary variables corresponding to fast and slow transport processes across the membrane respectively .",
    "the control parameters of the model are the external current applied , @xmath38 , and the internal state of the neuron , @xmath39 .",
    "we use a value of @xmath40 , as it yields dynamics which corresponds to a realistic description of the electrophysics of axons of certain neurons  @xcite .",
    "the model is capable of displaying both regular spiking as well as bursting ( chaotic ) dynamics for suitable regimes of the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the bursting behaviour exhibits chaos where there is alternating irregular spiking followed by a non - oscillatory phase which suddenly ends in a burst of spikes .    in our study",
    ", we have chosen @xmath41 which is in the chaotic regime  @xcite .",
    "we have sampled @xmath34 in steps of @xmath42 time unit to yield discrete - time neural signal @xmath43 and subsequently add i.i.d .",
    "gaussian noise @xmath27 to yield the final signal @xmath11 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : signals2 ] , we plot the remaining three ( noisy ) signals @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 obtained in a similar fashion from randomly chosen initial conditions of the neuron model ( followed by sampling and addition of i.i.d . gaussian noise @xmath27 ) . these are all essentially chaotic in nature ( the added noise , in fact makes it stochastic ) .",
    "the goal is to multiplex all the four signals from neuron @xmath8 to neuron @xmath9 . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the remaining @xmath44 neural signals @xmath45 are also obtained from the same model with the same settings of @xmath39 and @xmath38 but with randomly chosen initial conditions .",
    "as explained previously , the rest of the columns of @xmath24 ( 9850 ) are modeled as i.i.d gaussian @xmath29 entries .",
    "thus , we now have our ensemble of @xmath0 neural signals and neural noise which makes up equation  ( [ eqyequalax ] ) . for particular chosen values of the weights @xmath46 , we plot @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ysignal ] along with neural interference and noise .    under normal circumstances ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqyequalax ] ) is unsolvable , unless @xmath48 .",
    "this would imply that the neural signals need to be observed for a longer duration ( thereby making @xmath49 at least @xmath50 )",
    ". however , practical constraints such as immediate response to stimulus demand solving equation  ( [ eqyequalax ] ) with shorter duration signals , which leads to the under - determined case ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "surprisingly , this admits a unique solution which could be accurately determined via a recently developed signal processing paradigm known as compressed sensing ( to be discussed in the next section ) , provided the @xmath52s to be recovered form a sparse - set ( or a compressible set ) , and certain conditions are satisfied by the matrix composed of the noisy neural signals .",
    "compressed sensing ( cs ) is a recent signal detection framework which has received considerable attention in the signal processing community  @xcite .",
    "the signal measurement process is linear as in , the observed vector @xmath53 .",
    "if the number of non zero entries of @xmath54 is less than or equal to @xmath31 , we say @xmath54 is _",
    "the idea behind cs is that , if the received signal is sparse ( in an appropriate domain ) , most of what is received is thrown away during compression or processing  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible to reduce the number of measurements ( as a function of the sparsity of @xmath54 ) and using random projections it is possible to recover the entire ( sparse ) signal exactly  @xcite .",
    "further , it has been shown that perfect recovery is possible in the presence of noise as well  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath55 be a @xmath31-sparse signal .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the measurement matrix ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the columns of the matrix correspond to the signals ( vector - valued ) generated by each of the @xmath0 neurons .",
    "the received vector @xmath57 is a linear combination of columns of @xmath24 where the coefficients form the vector @xmath54 i.e.,@xmath58 .    in our problem of interest",
    ", this means that the signals from different neurons ( columns of @xmath24 ) are multiplexed together during transmission to the nearby neuron .",
    "the number of signals multiplexed is equal to the sparsity of @xmath54 .",
    "decoding of @xmath54 given @xmath59 can be carried out through a variety of techniques like greedy approach ( algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit  @xcite ) or optimization approach ( @xmath60 minimization  @xcite ) , provided the measurement matrix @xmath24 satisfies a property commonly referred to as restricted isometry property ( rip )  @xcite .",
    "for example , when the entries are all drawn from a gaussian distribution ( say @xmath29 ) appropriately normalized , the matrix satisfies rip . in these cases",
    ", it is possible to exactly recover @xmath54 .",
    "however , in our problem , we are only interested in identifying the columns that contribute to the signal and not the exact amplitudes . in the cs parlance , this is called support recovery  @xcite .",
    "consider the neuron @xmath9 which has received the signal @xmath58 from its neighbour @xmath8 . at @xmath9",
    ", it is only reasonable to assume that the signal set @xmath24 is not perfectly available .",
    "we consider the case where the neuron @xmath9 has to decode using a matrix @xmath61 ( instead of @xmath24 ) where noisy versions @xmath22 of the columns of @xmath24 are present in @xmath61 ( these correspond to signals from nearby neurons , the signal - dominant set ) and the rest @xmath28 of the columns are composed of independently sampled gaussian noise ( these correspond to signals from far away neurons , the noise - dominant set ) .",
    "this could be mathematically represented as follows : let @xmath62 denote the @xmath63 columns of @xmath24 and @xmath61 respectively . consider a set of indices , corresponding to the signal - dominant columns of @xmath24 and let them be labelled @xmath64 .",
    "then , @xmath65 where @xmath66s are independent gaussian noise vectors .",
    "now , the problem is that of recovering @xmath54 given @xmath61 and @xmath59 instead of @xmath24 and @xmath59 .",
    "however , this is equivalent to decoding @xmath54 from @xmath67 where @xmath68 which has variance , say @xmath69 .",
    "this can be achieved by solving the convex program @xmath70 which gives the sparse solution @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , it is shown in  @xcite that , under this setting , @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 are constants and @xmath75 is the same as @xmath54 at @xmath31 leading entries and the rest set to zero .",
    "surprisingly , even in the absence of @xmath76 of columns ( and the remaining columns corrupt ) , @xmath60 minimization is seen to perform well .",
    "this is evident from our simulation result depicted in figure  [ fig : recon ] .",
    "it shows that signals multiplexed and transported from @xmath8 are successfully demultiplexed at @xmath9 despite having only a noisy , partial version of the mixing matrix @xmath24 .",
    "we have used the following settings for our simulations .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath77 , 150 signal - dominant neural signals from hindmarsh - rose model ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 and randomly chosen initial conditions ) with additive gaussian noise @xmath27 , 9850 noise - dominant neural signals simulated as additive gaussian noise @xmath29 , @xmath32 signals to be multiplexed with weights @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the weights for the signal - dominant columns @xmath84 are drawn from uniform random distribution in @xmath85 , weights for the noise - dominant columns @xmath86 are drawn from uniform random distribution in @xmath87 .",
    "cvx , a package for specifying and solving convex programs  @xcite was used for @xmath60 minimization .",
    "threshold for choosing the @xmath31 significant weights ( in @xmath71 ) was set at @xmath88 .",
    "it seems imperative to study the neural signal detection problem using the compressed sensing framework because it is one approach in which the number of measurements ( size of the signal vector ) is greatly reduced depending on how many signals are multiplexed . in the context of neural signal transmission",
    ", this means that the time to respond to a stimulus is reduced when fewer signals are multiplexed .",
    "usual decoding algorithms in cs aim at exact recovery of the vector @xmath54 .",
    "however , in our problem , there are two aspects which makes decoding easier .",
    "firstly , the neuron does not need the entire @xmath54 , but only a few leading coefficients , which correspond to the signals of interest ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "secondly , the neuron does not need to extract the exact amplitude of these coefficients either , since it only needs to identify the  active \" columns of @xmath24 and no information is conveyed through spike amplitudes whatsoever .",
    "this corresponds to a support recovery problem and for certain classes of noise models ( @xmath89-bounded , gaussian ) , when the minimum amplitude is greater than @xmath90 times the noise level where @xmath31 is the sparsity of @xmath54 , exact recovery is possible  @xcite .    besides , since cs delivers perfect recovery under noisy conditions as well  @xcite , the recovery is robust even when the exact signal is not known at the receiver neuron ( @xmath9 in our example ) but only a noisy version like @xmath61 in our example .",
    "another point of biological relevance is the connection between neural complexity ( @xmath21 ) , number of neural signals multiplexed ( @xmath31 ) and the time to respond ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "organisms with lower neural complexity , although have good response time , are likely to multiplex fewer signals .",
    "on the other hand , organisms with higher neural complexity ( large @xmath21 ) can multiplex more signals and also have higher throughput of information transfer between adjacent neurons , albeit at the cost of longer response time .",
    "this relationship is very much in agreement with our proposed model since compressed sensing theory demands that the number of measurements @xmath49 obeys @xmath91  @xcite for good recovery of @xmath54 .",
    "the transport model between adjacent neurons in the brain that we have proposed has some unique features .",
    "the mixing matrix @xmath24 at pre - synaptic neuron @xmath8 and the corresponding matrix @xmath61 at the post - synaptic neuron @xmath9 need not have the same number of neural signals in the same order ( number and position of columns can be different , and is most likely the case in the brain ) . as a next step , it will be interesting to study the theoretical properties of the matrix @xmath24 ( and @xmath61 ) and the limits of such multiplexing .",
