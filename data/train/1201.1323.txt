    "the notion of mesh patterns was introduced by brndn and claesson @xcite to provide explicit expansions for certain permutation statistics as , possibly infinite , linear combinations of ( classical ) permutation patterns .",
    "this notion was further studied in @xcite . in particular , the notion of a mesh pattern was extended to that of a _ marked mesh pattern _ by lfarsson in @xcite .    in this paper , we study the number of occurrences of what we call _ simple marked mesh patterns_. let @xmath1 denote the set of natural numbers and @xmath2 denote the symmetric group of permutations of @xmath3 . if @xmath4 , then we will consider the graph of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , to be the set of points @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the graph of the permutation @xmath9 is pictured in figure [ fig : basic ] .",
    "then if we draw a coordinate system centered at a point @xmath7 , we will be interested in the points that lie in the four quadrants i , ii , iii , and iv of that coordinate system as pictured in figure [ fig : basic ] .",
    "for any @xmath10 and any @xmath11 , we say that @xmath12 matches the simple marked mesh pattern @xmath13 in @xmath5 if in @xmath6 relative to the coordinate system which has the point @xmath7 as its origin , there are @xmath14 points in quadrant i , @xmath15 points in quadrant ii , @xmath16 points in quadrant iii , and @xmath17 points in quadrant iv .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 , the point @xmath18 matches the simple marked mesh pattern @xmath19 since relative to the coordinate system with origin @xmath20 , there are 3 points in @xmath6 in quadrant i , there is 1 point in @xmath6 in quadrant ii , there are 2 points in @xmath6 in quadrant iii , and there are 2 points in @xmath6 in quadrant iv . note that if a coordinate in @xmath13 is 0 , then there is no condition imposed on the points in the corresponding quadrant .",
    "in addition , we shall consider patterns @xmath13 where @xmath21 . here when a coordinate of @xmath13 is the empty set , then for @xmath12 to match @xmath13 in @xmath11 , it must be the case that there are no points in @xmath6 relative to the coordinate system with origin @xmath7 in the corresponding quadrant .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 , the point @xmath22 matches the marked mesh pattern @xmath23 since relative to the coordinate system with origin @xmath24 , there are 6 points in @xmath6 in quadrant i , 2 points in @xmath6 in quadrant ii , no points in @xmath6 in quadrant iii , and no points in @xmath6 in quadrant iv .",
    "we let @xmath25 denote the number of @xmath26 such that @xmath12 matches the marked mesh pattern @xmath13 in @xmath5 .    given a sequence @xmath27 of distinct integers ,",
    "let @xmath28 be the permutation found by replacing the @xmath26-th largest integer that appears in @xmath5 by @xmath26 .",
    "for example , if @xmath29 , then @xmath30 .",
    "given a permutation @xmath31 , we say that the pattern @xmath32 _ occurs _ in @xmath11 provided there exists @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .",
    "we say that a permutation @xmath5 _ avoids _ the pattern @xmath32",
    "if @xmath32 does not occur in @xmath5 . let @xmath35 denote the set of permutations in @xmath2 which avoid @xmath32 .",
    "in the theory of permutation patterns , @xmath32 is called a _ classical pattern_. see @xcite for a comprehensive introduction to permutation patterns .    given a permutation @xmath11 ,",
    "we say that @xmath36 is a _",
    "right - to - left maximum _ of @xmath5 if @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "we let @xmath39 denote the number of right - to - left maxima of  @xmath5 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study the generating functions @xmath40 for any @xmath41 , let @xmath42 note that there is a natural action of the symmetries of the square on the graphs of permutations .",
    "that is , one can identify each permutation @xmath43 with a permutation matrix @xmath44 and it is clear that rotating such matrices by 90 degrees counterclockwise or reflecting permutation matrices about any central axis or any diagonal axis preserves the property of being a permutation matrix . for any permutation @xmath11 ,",
    "let @xmath45 be the _ reverse _ of @xmath5 and @xmath46 be the _ complement _ of @xmath5 .",
    "then it is easy to see that the map @xmath47 corresponds to reflecting a permutation matrix about its central vertical axis and the map @xmath48 corresponds to reflecting a permutation matrix about its central horizontal axis .",
    "it is also easy to see that rotating a permutation matrix by 90 degrees corresponds to replacing @xmath5 by @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that the map @xmath50 shows that @xmath51 , the map @xmath47 shows that for @xmath52 and the map @xmath48 shows that for @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , taking the inverse of permutations shows that @xmath54 , applying the composition of reverse and complement shows that @xmath55 , applying the composition of reverse and inverse shows that @xmath56 , and finally , applying the composition of reverse , complement and inverse , that is , the map @xmath57 , shows that @xmath58 .",
    "any other composition of the three trivial bijections on @xmath2 will not give us any new symmetries .",
    "thus we have the following lemma :    [ sym ] for any @xmath41 , @xmath59",
    "the equalities in the section title are true by lemma [ sym ] .",
    "thus we only need to consider the simple marked mesh pattern @xmath62 .",
    "first assume that @xmath63 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath64 if @xmath65 . for @xmath66 ,",
    "suppose that we start with a permutation @xmath11 and then we let @xmath67 denote the permutation of @xmath68 that results by adding @xmath69 to each element of @xmath5 and inserting @xmath69 before the element @xmath70 if @xmath71 and inserting 1 at the end if @xmath72 . then it is easy to see that @xmath73 that is , clearly the placement of 1 in position @xmath26 in @xmath67 can not effect the elements in quadrant i relative to any pair @xmath74 for any @xmath75 or relative to any pair @xmath76 for any @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath69 in position @xmath26 can contribute to @xmath78 if and only if @xmath79 .",
    "it then follows that for @xmath80 , @xmath81 iterating this recursion , we see that @xmath82 for all @xmath83 . in this case",
    ", we can form a simple generating function .",
    "that is , let @xmath84 then we know that @xmath85 hence @xmath86 taking the derivative of both sides with respect to @xmath87 , we see that @xmath88 thus @xmath89 it then follows that @xmath90 hence , using the fact that @xmath91 , we obtain that @xmath92    next , we consider a modification of the notion of a marked mesh pattern .",
    "that is , given a permutation @xmath11 , we say that @xmath12 matches the marked mesh pattern @xmath93 in @xmath5 if and only if , relative to the coordinate system with origin at @xmath7 , there are exactly @xmath94 points in @xmath6 in quadrant i. let @xmath95 denote the number of @xmath26 such that @xmath12 matches @xmath93 and @xmath96 then we can use the same reasoning to show that @xmath97 if @xmath65 , and , for @xmath80 , @xmath98 the difference in this case is that insertion of 1 will contribute to @xmath99 if and only if @xmath100 . iterating this recursion",
    ", we see that @xmath101 for all @xmath83 .",
    "it is then easy to see using the same reasoning as above that if we let @xmath102 then @xmath103    it is also easy to see that a point @xmath12 matches the pattern @xmath104 in @xmath11 if and only if @xmath12 is a right - to - left maximum of @xmath5 .",
    "it is well - known that the number of permutations @xmath43 such that @xmath105 is equal to the signless stirling number of the first kind @xmath106 which is the number of permutations @xmath107 such that @xmath32 has @xmath94 cycles .",
    "thus @xmath108 it is well - known that @xmath109",
    ". thus @xmath110",
    "note that it follows from lemma [ sym ] that @xmath111 equals @xmath112",
    "@xmath113    first , we consider the case where @xmath114 .",

    "it is easy to see that if @xmath118 , then @xmath119 that is , clearly the placement of 1 in position @xmath26 in @xmath67 can not effect the elements in quadrant i or ii relative to any pair @xmath74 for any @xmath75 or relative to any pair @xmath76 for any @xmath77 , and the @xmath69 in position @xmath26 can contribute to @xmath78 if and only if @xmath120 .",
    "it then follows that for @xmath117 , @xmath121 note this is the same recursion as the recursion for @xmath122 if @xmath123 .",
