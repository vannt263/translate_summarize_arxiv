    "radio pulsars in binary systems can allow the measurement of neutron star masses , thereby providing one side of the dense matter equation of state . however , to date all pulsars with precisely - measured masses have been relatively slowly rotating objects ( spin period @xmath7 typically tens of milliseconds ) in double neutron star systems or , in one case , an eccentric pulsar - massive white dwarf system ( see stairs , 2004 for a recent review ) .",
    "these neutron stars all fall within the narrow mass range of @xmath8 established by @xcite , with the exception of psr  b1913 + 16 at @xmath9 @xcite and psr  j0737@xmath03039b at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "millisecond pulsars ( @xmath11ms ) are generally thought to have accreted more matter from a low - mass binary companion and therefore are expected to be more massive than the slower - rotating recycled pulsars with massive companions .",
    "however , these low - mass binary pulsars do not experience measurable relativistic orbital period decay ( @xmath12 ) and their typically circular orbits make orbital precession ( @xmath13 ) and time dilation and gravitational redshift ( @xmath14 ) difficult to measure ; therefore , mass determinations have been less precise .",
    "there is a statistical suggestion that millisecond pulsars are indeed more massive than slower - rotating neutron stars @xcite , but with the exception of psr  j0751 + 1807 at @xmath15 ( nice et al .",
    ", in preparation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and possibly psr  j1748 - 2446i in the globular cluster terzan  5 @xcite , all are still consistent with the observed mass distribution of pulsars with massive companions .",
    "psr  j1909@xmath03744  was discovered during a large - area survey for pulsars at high galactic latitudes with the 64-m parkes radio telescope @xcite .",
    "it is a typical low - mass binary pulsar with @xmath16ms , but with several exceptional qualities : its extremely narrow pulse profile @xcite and stable rotation allow us to measure pulse arrival times with unprecedented precision , and its nearly edge - on orbital inclination means the pulsar signal experiences strong shapiro delay .",
    "measurement of this shapiro delay gives the orbital inclination and companion mass to high precision , and when combined with the keplerian orbital parameters , allows us to measure the pulsar s mass .",
    "in december 2002 , we began observing psr  j1909@xmath03744  with the caltech - parkes - swinburne recorder  ii ( cpsr2 , see * ? ? ? * ) at the parkes radio telescope .",
    "this instrument samples the voltage signal from the telescope in each of two 64-mhz wide dual - polarization bands with 2-bit precision . for these observations",
    ", we used the center beam of the parkes multibeam receiver or h - oh receiver and placed the two bands at sky frequencies of 1341mhz and 1405mhz .",
    "the raw voltage data were sent to a dedicated cluster of 30 dual - processor xeon computers for immediate analysis .",
    "the two - bit sampled data were corrected for quantization effects @xcite and coherently dedispersed into 128 frequency channels in each of 4 stokes parameters which were then folded at the topocentric pulse period using the psrdisp software package @xcite .",
    "we recently began observing psr  j1909@xmath03744  with the caltech - green bank - swinburne recorder  ii ( cgsr2 ) , a clone of cpsr2 installed at the 100-m green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "as our current gbt data set covers only a small fraction of the system s orbital phase , we have not included it in this analysis .",
    "off - line data reduction and calculation of average pulse times of arrival ( toas ) were accomplished in the usual manner using the psrchive suite .",
    "because of roll - off of the anti - aliasing filters , 8mhz was removed from each band edge prior to formation of dedispersed total intensity profiles , giving a final bandwidth of 48mhz per band . to avoid averaging over phenomena which vary on orbital timescales , observations longer than 10 minutes were broken into 10-minute segments . finally , toas were calculated by cross - correlation with a high signal - to - noise template profile , formed by summing a total of 5.4 days of integration in the 1341mhz band .",
    "arrival times with uncertainty greater than 1@xmath17s were excluded from further analysis .",
    "our final data set contains 1730 toas  roughly half of which come from each of our two frequency bands .",
    "we used the standard pulsar timing package tempo , along with the jet propulsion laboratory s de405 ephemeris , for all timing analysis .",
    "toas were corrected to utc(nist ) . using the toa uncertainties estimated from the cross - correlation procedure ,",
    "our best - fit timing model had reduced @xmath18 , indicating that our arrival time measurements are relatively free of systematic errors . in our final analysis ,",
    "these toa uncertainties were scaled by a factor of 1.1 to achieve a reduced @xmath19 and improve our estimation of uncertainties in model parameters .",
    "because tempo estimates parameter uncertainties based on the assumption that the reduced @xmath20 is unity , and because toa uncertainties normally must be scaled by significantly larger factors to satisfy this assumption , it has become customary to take twice the formal error from tempo as the 1@xmath21 uncertainty to compensate for systematic errors .",
    "we have not followed this practice as our scaling factor is nearly unity .",
    "because of the system s low eccentricity ( @xmath22 ) , we used the ell1 binary model which replaces the longitude of periastron ( @xmath23 ) , time of periastron ( @xmath24 ) , and @xmath22 with the time of ascending node ( @xmath25 ) and the laplace - lagrange parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the resulting parameter values are all consistent with those obtained using the dd model @xcite , though the estimated uncertainties of several orbital parameters differ significantly .",
    "we give the results of our timing analysis in table  [ tab : par ] .",
    "although the rms timing residual could be lowered to 74ns by integrating our daily observations , high time resolution around superior conjunction was vital in mapping the shapiro delay of the pulsar .",
    "the weighted rms residual of only 230ns obtained from 10-minute integrations in each of the two bands is still exceptional .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:1909_residuals ] , our timing data display the unmistakable signature of shapiro delay .",
    "measurement of this relativistic effect has allowed the precise determination of orbital inclination , @xmath28 , and companion mass , @xmath29 .",
    "these values were derived from a @xmath30 map in @xmath31  @xmath32 space ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1909_m2cosi ] ) , but are in excellent agreement with the results of tempo s linear least - squares fit for @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "combined with the mass function , our tight constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath34 determine the pulsar mass , @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1909_m1m2 ] ) .",
    "this result is several times more precise than the previous best mass measurements of heavily recycled neutron stars .",
    "we have used shapiro delay to measure two post - keplerian parameters for this system , shape @xmath36 and range @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the gravitational constant and @xmath39 is the speed of light .",
    "the value of @xmath13 predicted by general relativity is only 0.14 deg yr@xmath3 , so it will be many years before a third post - keplerian parameter can be measured in this extremely circular system .",
    "we note that psr  j1909@xmath03744  has the smallest eccentricity of any known system , @xmath40      the measured parallax , @xmath41mas gives a distance of @xmath42kpc .",
    "we can now calculate the mean free electron density along the line of sight to psr  j1909@xmath03744  based on its dispersion measure ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath43-derived distance estimate is 0.46kpc @xcite , indicating that the free electron density along the line of sight is significantly overestimated by the model .",
    "there are no pulsars near psr  j1909@xmath03744  on the sky with accurate parallax measurements , either through pulse timing or interferometry ; psr  j1909@xmath03744  will therefore provide an important constraint on galactic electron density models .",
    "the pulsar s proper motion induces an apparent secular acceleration equal to @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the secular acceleration corrupts the observed period derivative ( @xmath46 ) . since the pulsar s intrinsic spindown rate must be non - negative",
    ", we can obtain an upper distance limit of @xmath47kpc , consistent with the measured parallax .",
    "conversely , the measured proper motion and parallax - derived distance allow us to correct for the secular acceleration and determine the intrinsic spindown rate , @xmath48 , which we then use to calculate the characteristic age , @xmath49 , and surface dipole magnetic field , @xmath50 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : par ] ) .",
    "we note that the acceleration induced by differential galactic rotation is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the secular acceleration and has therefore been neglected .",
    "similarly , the secular acceleration induces an apparent @xmath12 .",
    "based on the distance and proper motion of psr  j1909@xmath03744 , this kinematic @xmath12 is expected to be @xmath51  about 400 times larger ( and of opposite sign ) than the predicted intrinsic value .",
    "we note that if we include @xmath12 in our timing model , the best - fit value is consistent with this prediction but the significance is low .",
    "therefore , we have not included @xmath12 in our analysis .",
    "however , in several years , this kinematic @xmath12 will give an improved measurement of the pulsar distance @xcite .",
    "the transverse velocity resulting from the parallax distance and the measured proper motion is @xmath2kms@xmath3 , somewhat higher than typical for binary millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "we note that , in the absence of the parallax distance measurement , we would have significantly underestimated the system s velocity .",
    "we have obtained the most precise mass of a heavily recycled neutron star through high - precision timing measurements of psr  j1909@xmath03744 : @xmath5 .",
    "while psr  j1909@xmath03744  appears to be more massive than the canonical range for mildly recycled pulsars ( @xmath52 ) , its mass is consistent with that of the original member of this class , namely psr  b1913 + 16 .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that a clear mass distinction can be made between the millisecond pulsars with low - mass white dwarf companions and the mildly recycled pulsars with massive companions .",
    "it is possible that neutron star birth masses are simply not as homogeneous as the sample of measurements suggested until recently . the discovery of psr  j0737@xmath03039b in the double pulsar system with @xmath53 is difficult to reconcile with the millisecond pulsars psr  j0751 + 1807 and psr  j1748 - 2446i , with most probable masses near or exceeding @xmath54 , based purely on post - supernova accretion history .",
    "if we assume that the mass of psr  j0737@xmath03039b ( the only well - measured slow pulsar mass and the lowest measured neutron star mass ) is representative of pre - accretion neutron stars , it appears that the accretion of less than 0.2@xmath55 is sufficient for spinning pulsars up to millisecond periods , implying that most of the companion s original mass may be lost from the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the more massive msps suggest that , in some cases , the accreted mass is several times larger .    shortly after their discovery",
    ", it was proposed that millisecond pulsars were produced from normal neutron stars that were recycled by the accretion of matter @xcite .",
    "however an alternative hypothesis was put forward by @xcite in which millisecond pulsars were created by the accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf . in this scenario ,",
    "the millisecond pulsar should be less than the chandrasekhar mass minus the binding energy that is realized upon collapse of the neutron star .",
    "psr  j1909@xmath03744 s mass suggests that the recycling process is more probable .",
    "the timing precision of psr  j1909@xmath03744  with a 64-m class telescope is extraordinary .",
    "every 10 minutes , cpsr2 yields two arrival times with a weighted rms residual of just 230ns . by integrating the data",
    "further , we found we could reduce the residual to just 74ns , but there is reason to believe that we can reduce this figure still further . at present typical integrations",
    "are only an hour , and there is potentially 512mhz of bandwidth at 20 cm available for precision timing at the parkes telescope , only 128mhz of which is used by the cpsr2 instrument .",
    "longer observations with four times the bandwidth could potentially yield arrival times with an integrated rms residual of just a few tens of ns . such precision would allow us to probe the universe for the signature of supermassive black hole binaries because of the effect of gravitational waves on timing measurements @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge s. anderson , w. van straten , j. yamasaki , and j. maciejewski for major contributions to the development of cpsr2 , and thank h. knight for assistance with observations .",
    "these data contain some arrival times from the p456 program of r. manchester et al .",
    "baj and srk thank nsf and nasa for supporting their research .",
