    "a sequence of discrete temporal events can be interpreted as a time - dependent point process , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 at each time step @xmath5 when an event takes place , otherwise @xmath6 . to detect bursty clusters in this binary event sequence we have to identify those events we consider correlated .",
    "the smallest temporal scale at which correlations can emerge in the dynamics is between consecutive events .",
    "if only @xmath3 is known , we can assume two consecutive actions at @xmath5 and @xmath7 to be related if they follow each other within a short time interval , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "for events with the duration @xmath9 this condition is slightly modified : @xmath10 .",
    "this definition allows us to detect bursty periods , defined as a sequence of events where each event follows the previous one within a time interval @xmath11 . by counting the number of events , @xmath12 , that belong to the same bursty period",
    ", we can calculate their distribution @xmath13 in a signal . for a sequence of independent events ,",
    "@xmath13 is uniquely determined by the inter - event time distribution @xmath0 as follows : @xmath14 for @xmath15 . if the measured time window is finite , the integral @xmath16 and @xmath17 , otherwise if @xmath18 then @xmath19 ( for related numerical results see si ) .",
    "consequently for any finite independent event sequence the @xmath13 distribution decays exponentially even if the inter - event time distribution is fat - tailed .",
    "deviations from this exponential behavior indicate correlations in the timing of the consecutive events .      to check the scaling behavior of @xmath13 in real systems we focused on outgoing events of individuals in three selected datasets : ( a ) a mobile - call dataset from a european operator ; ( b ) text message records from the same dataset ; ( c ) email communication sequences @xcite ( for detailed data description see materials and methods ) .",
    "for each of these event sequences the distribution of inter - event times measured between outgoing events are shown in fig.[fig:1 ] ( left bottom panels ) and the estimated power - law exponent values are summarized in table [ table:1 ] . to explore the scaling behavior of the autocorrelation function",
    ", we took the averages over @xmath20 randomly selected users with maximum time lag of @xmath21 . in fig.[fig:1].a and b",
    "( right bottom panels ) for mobile communication sequences strong temporal correlation can be observed ( for exponents see table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "the power - law behavior in @xmath2 appears after a short period denoting the reaction time through the corresponding channel and lasts up to @xmath22 hours , capturing the natural rhythm of human activities . for emails in fig.[fig:1].c ( right bottom panels )",
    "long term correlation are detected up to @xmath23 hours , which reflects a typical office hour rhythm ( note that the dataset includes internal email communication of a university staff ) .",
    ".characteristic exponents of the ( @xmath24 ) autocorrelation function , ( @xmath25 ) bursty number , ( @xmath26 ) inter - event time distribution functions and @xmath27 memory functions ( see si ) calculated in different datasets and for the model study . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the broad shape of @xmath0 and @xmath2 functions confirm that human communication dynamics is inhomogeneous and displays non - trivial correlations up to finite time scales .",
    "however , after destroying event - event correlations by shuffling inter - event times in the sequences ( see materials and methods ) the autocorrelation functions still show slow power - law like decay ( empty symbols on bottom right panels ) , indicating spurious unexpected dependencies .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the disability of @xmath2 to characterize correlations for heterogeneous signals ( for further results see si ) .",
    "however , a more effective measure of such correlations is provided by @xmath13 . calculating this distribution for various @xmath11 windows , we find that the @xmath13 shows the following scale invariant behavior @xmath28 for each of the event sequences as depicted in the main panels of fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "consequently @xmath13 captures strong temporal correlations in the empirical sequences and it is remarkably different from @xmath13 calculated for independent events , which , as predicted by ( [ eq:0 ] ) , show exponential decay ( empty symbols on the main panels )",
    ".    exponential behavior of @xmath13 was also expected from results published in the literature assuming human communication behavior to be uncorrelated @xcite .",
    "however , the observed scaling behavior of @xmath13 offers direct evidence of correlations in human dynamics , which can be responsible for the heterogeneous temporal behavior .",
    "these correlations induce long bursty trains in the event sequence rather than short bursts of independent events .",
    "we have found that the scaling of the @xmath13 distribution is quite robust against changes in @xmath11 for an extended regime of time - window sizes ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the measurements performed on the mobile - call sequences indicate that the @xmath13 distribution remains fat - tailed also when it is calculated for users grouped by their activity .",
    "moreover , the observed scaling behavior of the characteristic functions remains similar if we remove daily fluctuations ( for results see si ) .",
    "these analyses together show that the detected correlated behavior is not an artifact of the averaging method nor can be attributed to variations in activity levels or circadian fluctuations .",
    "distributions of correlated event numbers with various @xmath11 time - window sizes ( main panels ) , @xmath0 distributions ( right top panels ) and average autocorrelation functions ( right bottom panels ) .",

    "the broad distribution of inter - earthquake times in fig.[fig:2].a ( right top panel ) demonstrates the temporal inhomogeneities and the long tail of the autocorrelation function ( right bottom panel ) assigning long - range temporal correlations . counting the number of earthquakes belonging to the same bursty period with @xmath37 hours window sizes",
    ", we obtain a broad @xmath13 distribution ( see fig.[fig:2].a main panel ) , as observed earlier in communication sequences , but with a different exponent value ( see in table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "note that the presence of long bursty trains in earthquake sequences were already assigned to long temporal correlations by measurements using conditional probabilities @xcite .",
    "another example of naturally occurring bursty behavior is provided by the firing patterns of single neurons ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "the recorded neural spike sequences display correlated and strongly inhomogeneous temporal bursty behavior , as shown in fig.[fig:2].b .",
    "the distributions of the length of neural spike trains are found to be fat - tailed and indicate the presence of correlations between consecutive bursty spikes of the same neuron .      in each studied system ( communication of individuals , earthquakes at a given location , or single neurons )",
    "qualitatively similar behavior was detected as the single entities performed independent events or they passed through longer correlated bursty cascades .",
    "these cascades can be viewed as the result of building up some stress in the system ( even at the single component level ) e.g. the accumulation of important tasks in human communication , mechanical stress preceding an earthquake or integrated stimuli to a neuron .",
    "our hypothesis is that each bursty period is related to a single excitation that triggers a cascade relieving this stress , which would naturally explain the correlation between the events within the same train .",
    "this `` one cascade - one task '' hypothesis can be relevant for human communication , where we speculate that a single task execution can occasionally trigger a series of events responsible for the appearance of long bursty trains .",
    "this assumption is supported by the observation that bursty nodes communicate predominantly with only one of their neighbors @xcite , indicating that a bursty period maybe linked to a single task . for earthquakes",
    "we can make the same conjecture , since a bursty period of earthquakes at a given time and location are most likely related to the same seismic activity . in case of neurons , the firings take place in bursty spike trains when the neuron receives excitatory input and its membrane potential exceeds a given potential threshold @xcite .",
    "the spikes fired in a single train are correlated since they are the result of the same excitation and their firing frequency is coding the amplitude of the incoming stimuli @xcite .",
    "the correlations taking place between consecutive bursty events can be interpreted as a memory process , allowing us to calculate the probability that the entity will perform one more event within a @xmath11 time frame after it executed @xmath38 events previously in the actual cascade .",
    "this probability can be written as : @xmath39 therefore the memory function , @xmath40 , gives a different representation of the distribution @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath40 calculated for the mobile call sequence are shown in fig.[figmm3:cond1].a for trains detected with different window sizes .",
    "note that in empirical sequences for trains with size smaller than the longest train , it is possible to have @xmath41 since the corresponding probability would be @xmath19 . at the same time due to the finite size of the data sequence",
    "the length of the longest bursty train is limited such that @xmath40 shows a finite cutoff .",
    "we can use the memory function to simulate a sequence of correlated events .",
    "if the simulated sequence satisfies the scaling condition in ( [ eq : e ] ) we can derive the corresponding memory function by substituting ( [ eq : e ] ) into ( [ ebs : eq1_1 ] ) , leading to : @xmath42 with the scaling relation ( see si ) : @xmath43    in order to check whether ( [ cmm : eq5 ] ) holds for real systems and whether the memory function in ( [ cmm : eq1 ] ) describes correctly the memory in real processes we compare it to a memory function extracted from an empirical @xmath13 distributions .",
    "we selected the @xmath13 distribution of the mobile call dataset with @xmath44 second and derived the corresponding @xmath40 function .",
    "the complement of the memory function , @xmath45 , is presented in fig.[figmm3:cond1].b where we show the original function with strong finite size effects ( grey dots ) and the same function after logarithmic binning ( black dots ) .",
    "taking equation ( [ cmm : eq1 ] ) we fit the theoretical memory function to the log - binned empirical results using least - squares method with only one free parameter , @xmath27 .",
    "we find that the best fit offers an excellent agreement with the empirical data ( see fig.[figmm3:cond1].b and also fig.[figmm3:cond1].a ) with @xmath46 .",
    "this would indicate @xmath47 through ( [ cmm : eq5 ] ) , close to the approximated value @xmath48 , obtained from directly fitting the empirical @xmath13 distributions in the main panel of fig.[fig:1].a ( for fits of other datasets see si ) . in order to validate whether our approximation is correct",
    "we take the theoretical memory function @xmath40 of the form ( [ cmm : eq1 ] ) with parameter @xmath49 and generate bursty trains of @xmath50 events .",
    "as shown in fig.[figmm3:cond3].c , the scaling of the @xmath13 distribution obtained for the simulated event trains is similar to the empirical function , demonstrating the validity of the chosen analytical form for the memory function .",
    "as the systems we analysed are of quite different nature , from physics ( earthquakes ) to social ( human communication ) and biological ( neuron spikes ) systems , finding a single mechanistic model to fit them all is virtually impossible .",
    "therefore , our goal is to define a phenomenological model that captures common features of the observed dynamics and see how these features are related to each other .",
    "we assume that the investigated systems can be described with a two - state model , where an entity can be in a normal state @xmath51 , executing independent events with longer inter - event times , or in an excited state @xmath52 , performing correlated events with higher frequency , corresponding to the observed bursts . to induce the inter - event times between the consecutive events we apply a reinforcement process based on the assumption that the longer the system waits after an event , the larger the probability that it will keep waiting .",
    "such dynamics shows strongly heterogeneous temporal features as discussed in @xcite . for our two - state model system",
    "we define a process , where the generation of the actual inter - event time depends on the current state of the system .",
    "the inter - event times are induced by the reinforcement functions that give the probability to wait one time unit longer after the system has waited already time @xmath53 since the last event .",
    "these functions are defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 control the reinforcement dynamics in state @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "these functions follow the same form as the previously defined memory function in ( [ cmm : eq1 ] ) and satisfy the corresponding scaling relation in ( [ cmm : eq5 ] ) . if @xmath57 the characteristic inter - event times at state @xmath51 and @xmath52 become fairly different , which induces further temporal inhomogeneities in the dynamics .",
    "the actual state of the system is determined by transition probabilities shown in fig.[figmm3:cond3].b , where to introduce correlations between consecutive excited events performed in state @xmath52 we utilize the memory function defined in equation ( [ cmm : eq1 ] ) .    to be specific ,",
    "the model is defined as follows : first the system performs an event in a randomly chosen initial state .",
    "if the last event was in the normal state @xmath51 , it waits for a time induced by @xmath58 , after which it switches to excited state @xmath52 with probability @xmath59 and performs an event in the excited state , or with probability @xmath60 stays in the normal state @xmath51 and executes a new normal event .",
    "in the excited state the inter - event time for the actual event comes from @xmath61 after which the system decides to execute one more excited event in state @xmath52 with a probability @xmath40 that depends on the number @xmath38 of excited events since the last event in normal state .",
    "otherwise it switches back to a normal state with probability @xmath45 .",
    "note that a similar model without memory was already defined in the literature @xcite .",

    "the numerical results predicted by the model are summarized in fig.[figmm3:cond3 ] and table [ table:1 ] .",
    "we find that the inter - event time distribution in fig.[figmm3:cond3].c reflects strong inhomogeneities as it takes the form of a scale - free function with an exponent value @xmath65 , satisfying the relation @xmath75 . as a result of the heterogeneous temporal behavior with memory involved , we detected spontaneously evolving long temporal correlations as the autocorrelation function shows a power - law decay .",
    "its exponent @xmath67 ( see fig.[figmm3:cond3].d ) also satisfies the relation @xmath76 ( see si ) .",
    "the @xmath13 distribution also shows fat - tailed behavior for each investigated window size ranging from @xmath77 to @xmath78 ( see fig.[figmm3:cond3].a ) .",
    "the overall signal here is an aggregation of correlated long bursty trains and uncorrelated single events .",
    "this explains the weak @xmath11 dependence of @xmath13 for larger window sizes , where more independent events are merged with events of correlated bursty cascades , which induces deviation of @xmath13 from the expected scale - free behavior .",
    "the @xmath13 distributions can be characterized by an exponent @xmath63 in agreement with the analytical result in ( [ cmm : eq5 ] ) and it confirms the presence of correlated bursty cascades .",
    "in addition , even if we fix the value of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the @xmath24 exponent satisfies the condition @xmath79 , an inequality observed in empirical data ( see table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "in the present study we introduced a new measure , the number of correlated events in bursty cascades , which detects correlations and heterogeneity in temporal sequences . it offers a better characterization of correlated heterogeneous signals , capturing a behavior that can not be observed from the inter - event time distribution and the autocorrelation function .",
    "the discussed strongly heterogeneous dynamics was documented in a wide range of systems , from human dynamics to natural phenomena .",
    "the time evolution of these systems were found to be driven by temporal correlations that induced scale - invariant distributions of the burst lengths .",
    "this scale - free feature holds for each studied systems and can be characterized by different system - dependent exponents , indicating a new universal property of correlated temporal patterns emerging in complex systems .",
    "we found that the bursty trains can be explained in terms of memory effects , which can account for the heterogeneous temporal behavior . in order to better understand the dynamics of temporally correlated bursty processes at single entity level we introduced a phenomenological model that captures the common features of the investigated empirical systems and helps us understand the role they play during the temporal evolution of heterogeneous processes",
