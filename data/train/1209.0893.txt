    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite indicates that a weak coupling gravity theory in a @xmath5-dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime can be related to a strong coupling conformal field theory on the @xmath6-dimensional boundary . the ads / cft duality is a powerful tool for investigating strongly coupled gauge theories , the application might offer new insight into the study of strongly interacting condensed matter systems where the perturbational methods are no longer available .",
    "therefore , much attention has been given to the studies of the ads / cft duality to condensed matter physics and in particular to superconductivity recently @xcite . in these studies",
    "most of the holographically dual descriptions for a superconductor are based on a model that a simple einstein - maxwell theory coupled to a charged scalar .    since heisenberg and euler @xcite noted that quantum electrodynamics predicts that the electromagnetic field behaves nonlinearly through the presence of virtual charged particles , the nonlinear electrodynamics has been an interesting subject for many years @xcite because the nonlinear electrodynamics carries more information than the maxwell field .",
    "one of the important nonlinear electrodynamics is the logarithmic electromagnetic field which appears in the description of vacuum polarization effects .",
    "the logarithmic terms were obtained as exact 1-loop corrections for electrons in a uniform electromagnetic field background by euler and heisenberg @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite presented a born - infeld - like lagrangian with a logarithmic term which can be added as a correction to the original born - infeld one .",
    "the logarithmic electromagnetic lagrangian takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath0 is a coupling constant .",
    "the lagrangian tends to the maxwell case in the weak - coupling limit @xmath8 .    within the framework of ads / cft correspondence",
    ", the properties of holographic superconductors for a given black hole or soliton depend on behavior of the nonlinear electromagnetic field coupled with the charged scalar filed .",
    "we @xcite investigated the behaviors of the holographic superconductors by introducing a charged scalar field coupled with a power - maxwell field and found that the larger power parameter makes it harder for the scalar hair to be condensated .",
    "we @xcite also studied the holographic superconductors in gauss - bonnet gravity with born - infeld electrodynamics and noted that the model parameters and the born - infeld coupling parameter will affect the formation of the scalar hair , the transition point of the phase transition from the second order to the first order , and the relation connecting the gap frequency in conductivity with the critical temperature . in this paper we will study the behaviors of the holographic superconductors / insulator transition by introducing a charged scalar field coupled with a logarithmic electromagnetic field in both the einstein - gauss - bonnet ads black hole and soliton , and to see how the logarithmic electromagnetic field affect the formation of the scalar hair , the critical exponent , and the critical chemical potential of the systems .",
