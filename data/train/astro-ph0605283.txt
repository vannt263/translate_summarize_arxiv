    "a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of stars and planets is a leading goal of modern astronomy .",
    "the understanding of brown dwarfs , objects that make up the transition mass between stars and planets , is a necessary step in achieving this goal .",
    "the brown dwarf category typically divides into two subgroups , l - type and t - type : t - dwarfs make up the cooler subclass , usually defined by the existence of methane in their atmospheres ; l - dwarfs are usually defined by atmospheres cool enough to possess lithium , unlike most warmer m - stars , but warm enough that the vast majority of their atmospheric carbon is locked in co rather than ch@xmath0 . while diverse theories abound ( reipurth & clarke [ 2001 ] , bate , bonnell & bromm [ 2002 ] , boss [ 2001 ] , for example ) to explain the formation of such objects , accurate brown dwarf population statistics that may test these predictions remain scarce . to help address this gap , we initiated chaos , the cornell high - order adaptive optics survey for brown dwarf companions . in this survey",
    ", we used the palomar hale telescope s palao adaptive optics system ( troy et al .",
    "2000 ) and accompanying pharo science camera ( hayward et al . 2001 ) to conduct high - contrast coronagraphic observations of 80 main - sequence stars out to 22 parsecs ( carson [ 2005 ] , carson et al .",
    "[ 2005 ] ) .",
    "the most prominent result from this investigation was that zero systems showed positive evidence for brown dwarf companions , a result consistent with the `` brown dwarf desert '' described by marcy & butler ( 2000 ) for narrow separations ( @xmath13 au ) .",
    "but while our results are consistent with a brown dwarf desert , do they necessarily assert that a brown dwarf desert exists at intermediate separations ( like 25 - 100 au ) ?",
    "clearly , there are a number of circumstances that might entail an intermediate separation brown dwarf existing around a target star , while our observations of that star lead to a null detection : the brown dwarf s brightness could be below our sensitivity threshold ; the brown dwarf might be projected behind the parent star ; it might have an exceptionally high eccentricity causing its typical separation to differ significantly from its semi - major axis .",
    "these and other factors lead to a non - trivial relationship between observed and physical companion fractions . in this paper , we investigate this relationship in order to determine the brown dwarf companion population range consistent with our observational results .",
    "the monte carlo simulations described in this paper employ the following strategy : 1 ) gather all the simulated orbits for a given range of eccentricity , inclination , longitude of pericentre , and semi - major axis and project them onto an individual star field of view ; use this exercise to calculate the odds that the orbiting object falls within the field of view ; 2 ) making use of target star noise maps ( generated from observational data ) , determine the odds that a given apparent k - magnitude orbiting object would be detectable , assuming it lies within the field of view ; 3 ) convert the apparent k - magnitude to a brown dwarf mass , using the known target star distance , a sample age value , and baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) brown dwarf evolutionary models ; 4 ) assuming a sample brown dwarf mass function and a random inclination , eccentricity , and longitude of pericentre , determine the net likelihood , for a given semi - major axis , that an orbiting brown dwarf ( assumed to be existent ) would be detected during the target star observation ; 5 ) repeat this procedure for all target stars to find a net survey detection probability ; 6 ) use a likelihood analysis approach to determine which brown dwarf companion fractions are consistent with the derived detection probability and our null result .    in the literature of brown dwarf companions to main sequence stars , we are aware of only four other published studies that attempt to derive rigorous population statistics : marcy & butler ( 2000 ) , mccarthy & zuckerman ( 2004 ) , gizis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and lowrance ( 2005 ) . out of these four studies ,",
    "only one , marcy & butler ( 2000 ) , considers non - zero inclinations and eccentricities in their models .",
    "our monte carlo simulations , providing a thorough analysis of non - zero inclinations and eccentricities , therefore provide an important contribution to our knowledge of brown dwarf companion frequencies , and brown dwarf formation as a whole .    section 2 describes our target sample .",
    "section 3 summarizes our simulation procedures .",
    "sections 4 and 5 present our results and conclusions .",
    "in the first paper of this series ( carson et al . 2005 ) , we listed individual information on all target stars in our sample . there , from our 80 star sample , we compiled 3 a stars , 8 f stars , 13 g stars , 29 k stars , 25 m stars , and 2 stars with ambiguous spectral types .",
    "six of these targets were published binaries .",
    "the _ effective _ spectral type coverage , however , depends on the relative sensitivities of the various target observations .",
    "we determine the _ effective _ spectral type coverage by first calculating , from our observational data , the median sensitivity for a 13 - 73 m@xmath2 object orbiting with a semi - major axis 25 - 100 au , for all targets with a given spectral type .",
    "( see section 4.1 for a detailed presentation of our sensitivity calculations . )",
    "we take the ratio of this coverage ( e.g. 40% coverage , 80% coverage , etcetera ) to the median survey coverage and multiply it by the number of stars with the given spectral type . doing so , we derive an _ effective _ target distribution of 1.9 a stars , 5.9 f stars , 16.1 g stars , 28.6 k stars , 25.6 m stars , and 1.9 stars with ambiguous spectral types .    to gain some information on the age range of this sample , we examine fe / h line strengths published in cayrel de strobel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and cayrel de strobel , soubiran , & ralite ( 2001 ) .",
    "table 1 displays fe / h line strengths for the quarter of stars in our sample that had published values . to derive ages from these line strengths",
    ", we use the following equation from rocha - pinto et al .",
    "( 2000 ) :    @xmath3)\\ ] ]    _ t _ is the age in gyrs . we assume a minimum age of 250 myr and a maximum age of 10 gyr . for the stars with published line strengths ,",
    "such an equation yields an age distribution of 4.8 @xmath4 2.7 gyr .",
    "we note here that equation 1 represents a loose constraint on stellar age .",
    "however , for the purposes of our simulations , it represents a useful approximation . to extrapolate these values to the complete target sample",
    ", we must ignore observational biases in the fe / h line strength table .",
    "for instance , fainter stars such as m - dwarfs are under - sampled , considering their frequency , while brighter stars are somewhat over - sampled . stellar age , however , should not correlate strongly with spectral type , outside of the rarer early - type stars .",
    "thus , for the purposes of our simulations , we extrapolate our table 1 ages to be indicative of the complete sample . to address potential errors in this assumption",
    ", we include an examination describing how errors in these age estimates might affect our outputted values ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "prominent alternative techniques for determining stellar ages take advantage , for instance , of ca ii emission , lithium abundance , x - ray activity , galactic space motion , and galactic birth models .",
    "ca ii emission , lithium abundance , and x - ray activity are useful for young stars ( less than a couple hundred myrs typically ) , but provide poor constraints for older target populations ( see song , zuckerman , & bessel [ 2004 ] for a more thorough discussion of these age markers ) .",
    "galactic space motion can be effective for both old and young stars , but given that most , if not all , of our target population have poorly defined motion associations , this technique is impractical for our purposes .",
    "galactic birth models provide age predictions without the aforementioned drawbacks . however , given the degree of controversy accompanying the competing birth models , we conclude that their predictions are not better than the loose constraints provided by iron line estimates .",
    "( see burgasser [ 2004 ] for a more thorough discussion of galactic birth rate models as an estimate of stellar ages . )    as an additional caveat , we note that there is no a priori reason to expect that the brown dwarf companion frequency presented for this largely single - star sample is equivalent to the brown dwarf companion frequency around double , triple , or quadruple systems . indeed",
    ", some brown dwarf formation scenarios , such as clarke , reipurth , & delgado - donate ( 2004 ) , predict that the brown dwarf companion frequency around multiple systems will differ significantly from the single star companion frequency . estimating a multiple system brown dwarf companion frequency is therefore beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our likelihood analysis approach seeks to answer the question : how consistent is a hypothetical brown dwarf companion population with our observed results ? to answer this question , we begin by defining two parameters , _ @xmath5 _ and _ @xmath6 _ , which represent vectors describing all of the parameters of our brown dwarf population . _",
    "@xmath6 _ describes the fraction of stars with brown dwarf companions .",
    "@xmath5 _ represents all other population parameters including brown dwarf masses , brown dwarf luminosities , orbital radius distributions , etcetera .",
    "next we note that , for each star , we have a measurable probability of detecting a given luminosity brown dwarf .",

    "_ i _ includes factors such as throughput , exposure time , psf stability , etcetera . for a given star , therefore ,",
    "we may write the probability of a brown dwarf detection as :    @xmath8    since we detected no brown dwarf companions in our survey , we may write that , for the _ _ j__th observed star , the number of expected detections is _ @xmath9 _ = _ p@xmath10 _ @xmath11 1 .",
    "poisson statistics then dictate that the probability of detecting _",
    "k _ brown dwarfs around a given star is :    @xmath12    since we detected zero brown dwarfs , we seek to determine a likelihood for _ k _ = 0 . taking the product of _",
    "p@xmath13 _ over all 80 sampled stars , with _",

    "_ = luminosity of the parent star ; _ i _ includes instrument parameters such as exposure time and throughput ; _ @xmath9 _ = number of expected detections around the _ _ j__th star .",

    "this type of treatment takes precedent in population statistical studies such as tokovinin ( 1992 ) .",
    "we recommend that the reader refer to that publication for a further discussion of such a technique .    for our final analysis",

    "our monte carlo simulations begin by selecting , from a database of simulated orbits , all cases that cover a given range of semi - major axis , eccentricity , inclination , and longitude of pericentre . while our database does not cover an infinite range of orbits , it does include all combinations of eccentricity from 0 to 0.9 ( at 0.1 intervals ) , longitude of pericentre from 0 to 350 degrees ( at 10 degree intervals ) , inclination from 0 to 90 degrees ( at 10 degree intervals ) and semi - major axis from 5 to 900 au ( at log[au ] intervals @xmath220.03 ) .",
    "each simulated orbit array records an orbital path as well as the fractional time that an orbiting object would spend at each path position ( i.e. periastron positions have shorter fractions , apastron positions have longer fractions ) . in the next section we describe how we integrate these orbital arrays to derive survey detection probabilities .",
    "after gathering a set of potential orbits , we project our orbital arrays onto a target star field of view and determine the odds that an orbiting object with that semi - major axis would reside within the detector field of view .",
    "next we consider the likelihood , for instances when the object resides in the field of view , that it resides within a given noise threshold level , defined as a function of detector position , by our observational noise maps .",
    "( note that the noise threshold varies strongly with detector position ; at the parent star center , it is effectively infinite ; toward the edges of the field of view , it is typically flux - limited ; see paper 1 , section 4.2 for a further discussion of observational noise maps ) .",
    "this exercise therefore lets us determine the relative fractions of its period that a hypothetical brown dwarf spends at a given noise threshold position . to determine the resultant detection probability , we select potential brown dwarf absolute k@xmath23 magnitudes , extending from 8 to 23 magnitudes at intervals of 0.3 magnitudes .",
    "( brown dwarfs with absolute k@xmath23 magnitudes brighter than 8 magnitudes are deemed , statistically , to be effectively non - existent ; brown dwarfs with absolute k@xmath23 magnitudes fainter than 23 magnitudes are assumed to be invisible to our survey . ) we convert these absolute magnitudes to detector counts using the procedure described in paper 1 , section 4.2 .",
    "we then determine , for each absolute k@xmath23-magnitude , semi - major axis , and target observation , the odds of our being able to detect ( at 5@xmath24 ) an orbiting brown dwarf , assumed to be existent . to determine the net survey detection probability , for each absolute k@xmath23-magnitude and semi - major axis , we take the median , for a given k@xmath23-magnitude and semi - major axis , of all the aforementioned odds values .",
    "a goal of our analysis is to predict the overall detection probability for a brown dwarf , at a given semi - major axis , with a mass representative of the general 13 - 73 m@xmath25 brown dwarf population . to do this",
    ", we need to conduct a weighted average of the probabilities associated with the different absolute k@xmath23 magnitudes .",
    "we do this by using a field brown dwarf mass function from the literature ( see section 4.1 for a discussion of the different mass functions we used ) .",
    "we convert this mass function to a luminosity function using baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) evolutionary models and a table 1 age distribution .",
    "( we start with published mass functions , rather than published luminosity functions , since brown dwarf mass functions should be roughly age independent . ) using our resultant luminosity function , we are able to conduct a weighted average over all sampled absolute k@xmath23 magnitudes .",
    "thus , our final value represents a detection probability for a typical 13 - 73 m@xmath25 orbiting brown dwarf at a given semi - major axis .    to determine a detection probability for the l - dwarf subset , we use luminosity functions published in cruz et al .",
    "since the l - dwarf subset is defined by luminosity , we are able to avoid the age and mass function estimates used in the previous calculation . weighting the different k@xmath23-magnitude probabilities according to the luminosity function",
    ", we determine a survey l - dwarf detection probability for each sampled semi - major axis .",

    "( 2001 ) , and mccarthy & zuckerman ( 2004 ) , the study by marcy & butler ( 2000 ) includes a significantly more robust account of orbital projection effects .",
    "being a radial velocity survey , their semi - major axis measurements derive from period , rather than an orbital projection .",
    "hence , inclination is the dominant orbital bias that they must consider .",
    "accounting for this bias with analytical approximations , they conclude a brown dwarf companion fraction , for main sequence stars , of @xmath11% for @xmath13 au semi - major axes . our companion fraction is consistent with this brown dwarf desert , though we can not confirm or contradict the extension of this extreme paucity through the 25 - 100 au semi - major axis region .    the results from our re - analysis of the gizis et al .",
    "l - dwarf companion fraction presents a comparison to our intermediate separation survey results .",
    "the 0%-4% companion fraction , derived from that re - analysis , suggests that the @xmath351000 au l - dwarf companion fraction may be similar to the intermediate separation ( 25 - 100 au ) l - dwarf companion fraction ( 0.0%-3.3% ) , derived from our chaos survey .",
    "using monte carlo simulations to account for orbital projection effects , we conclude that observational results from the chaos survey for brown dwarf ( 13 - 73 m@xmath25 ) companions is most consistent with a brown dwarf companion fraction of 0% - 9.3% , for the 25 - 100 au semi - major axis regime .",
    "we compare this value to brown dwarf companion fractions reported by marcy & butler ( 2003 ) for @xmath13 au separations , and find our results to be consistent with their value .",
    "however , our uncertainties are too large to either confirm or contradict the continuance of this extreme paucity through the intermediate separation semi - major axis region . compared to the published main sequence",
    "stellar companion fraction ( just above 10% for 0.08 - 0.32 m@xmath32 mass companions and a 25 - 100 au semi - major axis range [ duquennoy & mayor 1991 and fischer & marcy 1992 ] ) , our simulations suggest that the brown dwarf companion fraction is smaller than the fraction one would expect by an extrapolation of stellar companion statistics .    for the l - type brown dwarf subset , we determine a companion fraction of 0.0%-3.3% .",
    "we find that this value is comparable to wide separation ( 1000 au - 40000 au semi - major axis ) l - dwarf companion fraction estimates by gizis et al .",

    ", we show that the majority of published brown dwarf companion fraction surveys suffer from systematic observational biases ( resulting most notably from orbital projection effects ) that lead their authors to report companion fraction statistics that are not supported by their observational data .",
