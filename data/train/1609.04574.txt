    "the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) , which is defined as the temperature change ( i.e. , as the cooling or heating ) of a magnetic system due to the variation of an external magnetic field , has a long history in cooling applications at various temperature regimes  @xcite . since the first successful experiment of the adiabatic demagnetization performed in 1933  @xcite , the mce represents the standard technique for achieving the extremely low temperatures  @xcite . in this regard , theoretical predictions and descriptions of materials showing an enhanced mce create real opportunities for the effective selection of the construction for working magnetic - refrigeration devices .",
    "a great theoretical interest in  mce has recently been focused on some frustrated structures that may achieve huge adiabatic cooling rates in the vicinity of critical fields due to the large ( often macroscopic ) degeneracy of states  @xcite .    in general",
    ", the mce is characterized by the isothermal entropy change ( @xmath3 ) and by the adiabatic temperature change  ( @xmath4 ) upon the magnetic field variation .",
    "depending on sings of these magnetocaloric potentials , the mce can be either conventional ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) or inverse ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "in the former case the system cools down when the magnetic field is removed adiabatically , while in the latter case it heats up . whether the conventional or inverse mce is present",
    "basically depends on the particular magnetic arrangement in the system .",
    "namely , the former phenomenon can be observed in regular ferromagnets or paramagnets , while the latter one can be detected in ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials .",
    "moreover , the coexistence of both phenomena is also possible .",
    "in fact , the conventional and inverse mces have been theoretically observed in magnetic systems with rich structure of the ground - state phase diagram , in particular , in various one - dimensional spin models  @xcite , some finite structures  @xcite and multilayers  @xcite .",
    "however , the enhanced mce has been so far rigorously investigated only in one - dimensional systems  @xcite or in some finite structures  @xcite due to a lack of exactly solved spin models in higher dimensions accounting for a non - zero magnetic field . theoretical description of this phenomenon in two- and three - dimensional magnetic systems is usually based only on some approximative methods  @xcite .    in 1960 ,",
    "fisher has proposed a novel spin-@xmath9 super - exchange ising antiferromagnet on a decorated square lattice , which permits a rigorous solution of the partition function in the presence of an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the spin-@xmath9 fisher s super - exchange model and its other variants  @xcite can thus be used for exact theoretical study of the effect of applied field on magnetic properties of a certain class of magnetic insulators , e.g. , for investigation of the cooling or heating efficiency of the system in a vicinity of discontinuous ( first - order ) and continuous ( second - order ) phase transitions . in addition , these spin models may also bring a considerable insight into deficiencies of some approximative methods .",
    "motivated by aforementioned facts , the purpose of this paper is to extend the rigorous theoretical examination of the mce to a class of two - dimensional spin models .",
    "we will consider the generalized spin-@xmath0 fisher s super - exchange model on a decorated square lattice in order to bring a deeper insight into how the critical behavior of the model depends on the magnitude of decorating spins .",

    "in addition , exchange interactions of the same intensity but of opposite signs have to be supposed between the nearest spin neighbors in the horizontal and vertical directions to ensure an exact tractability of the considered spin system .",
    "for this reason , we will further assume the ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) coupling @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) on the horizontal ( vertical ) bonds of the lattice .",

    "[ fig:2 ] for three different values of the decorating spins .",
    "note that the plotted curves are unique solutions of the critical condition  ( [ eq : tc ] ) and therefore , they present the lines of continuous ( second - order ) phase transitions between the long - range ordered and paramagnetic phases . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the critical temperature of the model generally decreases with the increasing magnetic field until it entirely tends to zero at the critical field @xmath62 of the first - order phase transition between long - range ordered and paramagnetic ground states .",
    "for the decorating spins @xmath68 , critical lines approach the first - order phase transition with negative slopes , while for reverse case @xmath69 , they approach the critical field @xmath62 with positive slopes .",
    "these observations clearly suggest that reentrant phase transitions appear in the magnetic - field region @xmath70 just for sufficiently high decorating spins @xmath69 .",

    "it has been shown that the studied mixed - spin model exhibits reentrant phase transitions with two consecutive critical points slightly above the critical field @xmath62 corresponding to the first - order phase transition between the long - range ordered and paramagnetic ground states if decorating spins take the sufficiently high values @xmath133 .",
    "the existence of this non - trivial phenomenon has also been confirmed by temperature variations of the spontaneous and staggered magnetization of the nodal and decorating spins , respectively , as well as , by remarkable temperature dependencies of the specific heat exhibiting two logarithmic singularities .",
    "moreover , the mce has been particularly examined by means of the isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change .",
    "the investigation of both magnetocaloric potentials has enabled us to rigorously clarify the magnetic refrigeration efficiency of the considered spin model in a vicinity of the first - order phase transition between the long - range ordered ground state and the paramagnetic ground state as well as nearby the critical temperature , which completely destroys the antiferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "the obtained results clearly indicated the fast heating of the studied mixed - spin system during the adiabatic demagnetization process ( i.e. , a presence of the enhanced inverse mce ) in these regions due to strong thermal spin fluctuations leading to the temperature - induced increase of the total magnetization corresponding to decorating spins .",
    "the maximal heating efficiency of the system has been observed for the magnetic - field change @xmath128 , which coincides with the first - order phase transition between the long - range ordered and paramagnetic ground states .    finally , it is worthwhile to mention that the presented generalization of the fisher s super - exchange antiferromagnet on a decorated lattice in terms of arbitrary decorating spins is just one of many possible .",
    "other simple generalizations allowing rigorous investigation of an enhanced mce in two - dimensional spin systems are the introduction of the second - neighbor interaction between nodal spins  @xcite , the introduction of the chemical potential  @xcite , the axial zero - field splitting  @xcite , the transverse magnetic field as well as the rhombic zero - field splitting on decorating spins .",
    "moreover , one may also consider other planar lattices with the even coordination number , such as the kagom lattice and the triangular lattice .",
    "our future work will continue in this direction .",
