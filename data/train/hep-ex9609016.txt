    "the dilepton decay channels in which both the w s decay into leptons and neutrinos are under - constrained with respect to the the reconstruction of the top quark mass due to the presence of the two missing neutrinos .",
    "nevertheless as dalitz and goldstein @xcite and independently kondo@xcite et al have shown , it is possible to extract mass information from these events using a likelihood method . for each event ,",
    "solutions are obtained for the kinematic quantities for a range of top quark masses .",
    "each solution is weighted by a product of structure functions which estimates the probability of producing a pair consistent with the event at that top quark mass and a decay probability factor which neglects the polarization of the top quark . in this paper",
    "we show that the dalitz - goldstein weighting scheme leads to a systematic underestimation of the top quark mass .",
    "we propose a likelihood scheme which involves no kinematic weighting that is shown to estimate the top quark mass correctly .",
    "finally we show that _ not _ allowing for the spin correlations in the decay of top quarks in the dalitz - goldstein scheme does not further bias the mass estimate significantly .    with the proposed luminosity upgrades of the tevatron @xcite , it is possible to acquire thousands of events of the type @xmath2 , where both the @xmath3 quark jets are identified .",
    "the number of jet permutations in these channels is smaller than the lepton + jets decay modes of the top quark .",
    "it may then become possible to measure the top quark mass using the dilepton channels with the least amount of systematic error .",
    "each dilepton event is characterized by 14 measurements , namely the three vectors of the two @xmath3 jets , leptons and the missing @xmath4 vector of the event .",
    "we denote these measurements collectively by the configuration vector @xmath5 .",
    "kinematically , each event is characterized by 18 variables namely , the three vectors of the @xmath3 jets , leptons and the two missing neutrinos . for any given top quark mass , there are four constraints , that constrain the lepton and neutrino pairs to the w mass and the w and @xmath3 pairs to the top quark mass .",
    "given a top quark mass , this enables one to solve for the neutrinos .",
    "this results in a pair of quadratic equations for the transverse components of each neutrino @xcite .",
    "the solution involves finding the intersection of two ellipses .",
    "this can yield zero , two or four solutions for a given top quark mass .",
    "the likelihood p(@xmath6 ) of a solution for a top quark mass @xmath7 , given the observed configuration vector @xmath5 , is obtained by using bayes theorem .",
    "@xmath8    where p(@xmath7 ) is the _ a priori _ probability distribution of the top quark mass .",
    "p(@xmath9 ) is the probability of observing the configuration vector @xmath5 , for a given top quark mass @xmath7 .",
    "if after each event is analyzed , p(@xmath7 ) is updated by p(@xmath6 ) iteratively , one gets the familiar multiplicative rule for combining likelihoods .",
    "dalitz and goldstein @xcite use the prescription @xmath10 where f(@xmath11 ) , f(@xmath12 ) are the probabilities of finding partons with momentum fraction @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the colliding beam particles consistent with producing the event in question and d(@xmath13 ) ( d(@xmath14,m ) ) is the probability of observing a lepton of energy @xmath15 in the rest frame of the top ( anti - top ) quark .",
    "the expression for d(@xmath16 ) as given in @xcite neglects the top quark polarization , but treats the subsequent w decays according to the standard model . in reality spin correlations",
    "are present and the two decays are correlated .      the expression for p(@xmath9 ) in equation([eqn1 ] ) must be further modified to take into account measurement errors . if the measured configuration vector is @xmath17 of a true configuration vector @xmath5 , we can write @xmath18 where the function r(@xmath19 ) is the resolution function of the experiment , denoting the probability of observing the configuration vector @xmath17 given a true configuration vector @xmath5 . the resolution of each of the components of @xmath5 is contained in the resolution vector @xmath20 . in practice , it is possible to choose the configuration vector @xmath5 such that r(@xmath21)is gaussian . due to the symmetric nature of the gaussian in @xmath5 and @xmath17 , we can re - express equation ( [ eqn2 ] ) as @xmath22",
    "this gaussian integration can be carried out by smearing the measured configuration @xmath17 repeatedly in a gaussian fashion with standard deviations @xmath20 such that , for n smeared configurations , @xmath23 the monte carlo integration then yields @xmath24      in what follows , we will assume that both the leptons are electrons .",
    "we choose the three quantities , energy , pseudo - rapidity and azimuth ( e,@xmath25 ) to define the three vectors of the leptons and jets .",
    "the electrons are smeared with a typical collider detector fractional resolution of @xmath26 in energy and the jets with a fractional energy resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "we ignore the fluctuations in direction , as these are dwarfed by the energy fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath28 of the rest of the event after removing the leptons and jets is also a measured quantity and is smeared as though it were a small jet .",
    "the is a deduced quantity from the measured quantities listed .",
    "the case when one or both of the leptons is a muon is handled by smearing the inverse momentum of the muon as a gaussian , but will not be further discussed here .",
    "we do not _ a priori _ know which lepton is associated with which @xmath3 quark .",
    "we consider both combinations and add the likelihoods from either combination to form the total likelihood for each event , which is normalized to unity when integrated over the top quark mass @xmath7 .",
    "we generate the likelihood spectrum for each event in the top quark mass range of 100- 250 gev / c@xmath29 at intervals of 1 gev / c@xmath30    the combined likelihood for an ensemble of events is obtained by multiplying the likelihoods of the individual events . the likelihood for",
    "an individual event can be zero for some values of the top quark mass due to the fact that we have used a narrow resonance approximation for the w mass in finding the solutions , and due to the finite number of smears done per event . in order to prevent the combined likelihood having zeroes in some bins due to these effects ,",
    "we add a uniform floor probability distribution that integrates to @xmath31 , in the top quark mass interval 100 - 250 gev / c@xmath29 to the likelihood distribution of each event and renormalize it .",
    "the final mass values are insensitive to the exact value of the floor .",
    "the individual event likelihoods are sampled at top quark mass intervals of 1 gev / c@xmath29 .",
    "the combined likelihood mass errors can fall below 1 gev / c@xmath29 .",
    "we interpolate the individual event likelihoods at mass intervals of 0.25 gev / c@xmath29 so that the final combined event likelihood can span several bins in mass . in general monte carlo events",
    "have weights associated with them .",
    "these were normalized so that the average weight in the event sample was unity .",
    "events with weights outside the window 0.3- 3.0 were rejected . the likelihood distribution for each event",
    "was raised to the power given by its weight before being used to form the combined likelihood .",
    "we select only those events with @xmath32 15 gev for both the leptons and jets and @xmath33 .",
    "we demand that both the @xmath3 jets are explicitly identified by a tagging algorithm .",
    "while smearing , we only admit smeared configurations that satisfy the same criteria as the event selection .    in what follows we smear",
    "each monte carlo generated event once to simulate the measurement process and subsequently 1000 times to do the monte carlo integration .",
    "we generate monte carlo events with a top quark mass of 175 gev / c@xmath29 . we neglect top quark polarization in generating these events , but treat the subsequent w decays according to the standard model@xcite .",
    "no final state or initial state radiation is included in this initial set of events .",
    "the events have pairs produced according to the standard qcd processes ( dominated at fermilab energies by valence quark fusion and @xmath34 channel gluon exchange ) .",
    "the top quark polarization is neglected after production .",
    "the w s are decayed correctly according to the standard model , mimicking the assumptions going into the dalitz - goldstein weighting scheme .",
    "we call this the uncorrelated sample .    figure ( [ fig1](a ) ) shows the unweighted distribution of solutions found for the @xmath35 1000 smeared configurations for a typical such event .",
    "the solutions turn on at a mass of 140 gev / c@xmath29 and stay turned on till the end of the mass range at 250 gev / c@xmath29 .",
    "figure ( [ fig1](b ) ) shows the probability distribution for this event using the dalitz - goldstein prescription of equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) .",
    "the structure function weighting in equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) makes the high mass solutions less likely yielding a likelihood distribution that has a distinct peak .",
    "we now proceed to analyze a sample of @xmath35 1000 such monte carlo events that decay into dileptons . because of measurement errors , not all of these events will give solutions consistent with a top quark in the mass range 100 - 250 gev / c@xmath29 . figure ( [ fig2 ] )",
    "is a histogram of the quantity @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of solutions for top quark mass @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the total number of top quark masses considered and @xmath41 is the total number of smears per event .",
    "the sum extends for top quark masses in a window @xmath42 35 gev / c@xmath29 of the generated top quark mass .",
    "there is a peak in the histogram for values of @xmath36 below 0.1 .",
    "this is due to events that are so mismeasured that they have difficulty solving for a top quark mass in the window considered even when smeared a thousand times .",
    "we reject events with @xmath430.2 since these will have very spiky likelihood distributions .",
    "= 16.cm    figure ( [ fig3](a ) ) is the combined likelihood of 511 events which survive after event selection criteria and the @xmath36 cut from an initial sample of 925 events , using the dalitz - goldstein weighting scheme @xcite .",
    "the most likely top quark mass from the event sample is 164.5 @xmath42 0.54 gev / c@xmath29 .",
    "the dalitz - goldstein weighting scheme thus introduces a bias of 10.5 gev / c@xmath29 towards lower masses at this value of the top quark mass .      for a given event ,",
    "the parton momenta ( @xmath44 ) needed to produce it will decrease as the top quark mass @xmath7 is decreased since @xmath45 , where @xmath34 is the overall center of mass energy squared .",
    "this means that the dalitz - goldstein weighting scheme will tend to skew the likelihood distribution for each event toward lower top quark masses , since it is proportional to the product of the structure functions .",
    "we note that the top quark production cross section is also a product of such structure functions and decreases rapidly as the top quark mass increases , for the same reason .",
    "the likelihood scheme proposed by kondo et al @xcite is proportional to the top quark production cross section and also suffers from this defect .",
    "it is this skewing of the likelihood distributions towards lower masses that produces a 10.5 gev / c@xmath29 bias in the dalitz - goldstein scheme .",
    "one can indeed ask why the top quark mass measurement has to be coupled to its production mechanism at all .",
    "figure ( [ fig1](a ) ) shows the number of solutions for a typical event as a function of the top quark mass .",
    "we now make the radical proposal of not using any weights at all , but simply use a likelihood distribution that is shaped like the number of solutions as a function of the top quark mass .",
    "if one examines this distribution visually for an ensemble of top quark events , there exist a significant number of events where the likelihood distribution thus formed does show a peak and falls for large top quark masses . using this scheme",
    ", one gets the combined likelihood of figure ( [ fig3](b ) ) which peaks at the input mass , but has a larger standard deviation .",
    "the larger standard deviation is due to the fact that we are not suppressing the high mass tail of the individual event likelihood distributions using a weighting scheme .",
    "this method does not use any extrinsic information of the top quark production mechanism to obtain the mass but relies solely on the measured kinematic quantities of the events in question .",
    "we christen this scheme the  no - weights \" method .",
    "= 16.cm    figure ( [ fig4](a ) ) shows the evolution of the mean value of the combined likelihoods for the dalitz - goldstein method and the no - weights method as a function of the number of events .",
    "figure ( [ fig4](b ) ) shows the evolution of the standard deviation @xcite of the combined likelihoods using the two methods as a function of the number of events .",
    "an approximate @xmath46 dependence on the number of events is evident .",
    "= 16.cm    the  no - weights \" mass is slightly sensitive to the value of the @xmath36 cut , since the events rejected by the @xmath36 cut tend to favor lower top masses .",
    "it is possible to adjust the @xmath36 cut so that the input top mass is returned by the  no - weights \" algorithm . once tuned at one generated top quark mass , the algorithm works well at all other masses with the cut unchanged .",
    "the dalitz - goldstein scheme can not reproduce the generated mass for any value of the @xmath36 cut .",
    "it should be noted that the window chosen around the generated mass in defining the @xmath47 cut has to be symmetric about the generated mass to avoid bias .",
    "this can be done iteratively when dealing with data .",
    ".summary of top quark mass measurements on various monte carlo samples [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      we now generate events where both the top and anti - top quark polarizations are taken into account and all spin correlations are kept at the tree level @xcite .",
    "we use the two weighting methods outlined above to determine the top quark mass .",
    "the results are presented in table ( [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "there is no apparent shift in the top quark mass between the two samples for either method . from this , we conclude that spin correlations do not affect the determination of the top quark mass in the dilepton channel in any significant way .",
    "the monte carlo samples used so far do not include additional jets due to initial and final state gluon radiation .",
    "we now generate @xmath35 1000 events at top quark masses of 140,160,180 and 200 gev / c @xmath29 using the program isajet @xcite .",

    ", the dalitz - goldstein method underestimates the generated mass .",
    "the  no - weights \" method can now be used to estimate the effects due to final state radiation as implemented in isajet .",
    "it can be seen that the net effect of the final state radiation is to systematically lower the measured value of the top quark mass .",
    "the amount of lowering increases with the top quark mass , due to the increased amount of final state radiation . at a top quark mass of 180 gev / c@xmath29 , the effect of final state radiation is to lower the top quark mass by @xmath35 5 gev / c@xmath29 .",
    "finally , we have also studied the effect of the event selection @xmath4 cuts for their effect on the result .",
    "we get results that are the same within errors , even when no @xmath4 cuts are used .",
    "if one insists on weighting events using production and decay information from the standard model , the expression for p(@xmath9 ) has to have the following properties . @xmath48",
    "an expression that satisfies this is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the top quark production _",
    "visible _ in the detector .",
    "the biasing effect in the top quark mass due to the structure function product is removed by division by the function @xmath50 .",
    "the configuration vector can be chosen as any set of measured variables , since the resulting expression for p(@xmath6 ) is invariant under a change of variables @xcite",
    ". however , equation ( [ eqn2 ] ) , implies a unique set of variables for the configuration vector @xmath5 , since these are the quantities that are fluctuated in a gaussian fashion . we will report on results using this weighting scheme in a forthcoming paper",
    "we have demonstrated a new likelihood method that determines the top quark mass in dilepton decays of the top quark that gives an unbiased estimate of the top quark mass .",
    "we demonstrate that weighting schemes that involve products of structure functions such as the dalitz - goldstein scheme , give a downward bias to the measured value of the top quark mass .",
