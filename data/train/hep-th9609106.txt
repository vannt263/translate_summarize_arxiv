    "since our spacetime may ultimately prove to be discrete , field theories on discrete spacetimes have developed an interest in and of themselves @xcite .",
    "in particular , field theories on two - dimensional discrete spacetimes can be interpreted as string theories with a discrete string worldsheet and a continuous target space .",
    "exact solutions for such theories can often be obtained even after quantization ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "yet another approach to discretizing spacetime and constructing a theory of gravity based on stochastic properties of random lattices is advocated by r. sorkin @xcite .",
    "investigation of field theories on discrete spacetime might therefore contribute to our understanding of discrete quantum picture of the universe .",
    "we shall focus on the connection between the discrete - spacetime and the continuous - spacetime versions of the same field theory .",
    "this work was motivated by the ( somewhat `` mysterious '' ) fact noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that a particular discrete version of the two - dimensional wave equation gives _ exact _ solutions of the underlying continuous equation .",
    "in other words , the exact solution of the free scalar field theory coincides , on the lattice points , with the solution of the lattice version of the same theory .",
    "the main intent of this paper is to understand the origin of the exact equivalence of continuous field theories and their discrete counterparts , as well as to find more general classes of ( classical ) field theories that are exactly solved by properly chosen discretizations .",
    "the origin of the exact solution property of discretized equations turns out to be the discrete conformal symmetry of the models @xcite .",
    "the exact solution property of the massless bosonic model has a direct application in numerical simulations of strings ( which was the original context of ref .",
    "a quantized version of the discrete conformal symmetry may prove useful in string theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the exact solution property of the discretized two - dimensional wave equation . then , in sec .",
    "[ secdci ] , an analysis of the discrete equations leads us to the concept of discrete conformal invariance ( dci ) , and we give general conditions for a given discrete field equation to possess dci . in sec .",
    "[ secgen ] we present a general description of discrete models with dci , and show that they all yield exact solutions for the corresponding ( first and/or second - order ) differential equations ; these solutions are always algebraically factorized .",

    "the two - dimensional wave equation came out of numerical modeling of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations for the target space variables @xmath0 are @xmath1 with gauge conditions @xmath2 here , the subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote differentiation with respect to world - sheet coordinates .",
    "the string world - sheet can be discretized to a rectangular lattice with coordinates @xmath5 and steps @xmath6 @xmath7 . a common second - order discretization of ( [ waveequ ] )",
    "would be @xmath8    however , a special choice of discretization steps , @xmath9 , was adopted in @xcite , and it was noted that the resulting discrete equations are not only simpler , @xmath10 @xmath11 ^2=0 ,   \\label{dwegaugefix}\\ ] ] but in addition exactly solve the continuous equation ( [ waveequ ] ) .",
    "namely , one can easily check that the general solution of ( [ waveequ ] ) , @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are vector functions of one argument , which are determined from the appropriate boundary conditions ) exactly satisfies the discretized equation ( [ dwaveequ ] ) .",
    "the gauge conditions ( [ dwegaugefix ] ) are then reduced to constraints on @xmath15 , @xmath16 ^2=0 .",
    "\\label{dwesolconstr}\\ ] ]    to try to understand why this happens , let us examine the discretization ( [ dwaveequ ] ) in more detail . expanding ( [ dwaveequ ] ) in powers of the discretization step @xmath17 , we notice that the discrete equation ( [ dwaveequ ] ) , on solutions of @xmath18 , is satisfied to all orders in @xmath19 : @xmath20 since @xmath21 approximation to all orders means exact solution in the following sense .",
    "one can show that @xmath22 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are now arbitrary vector functions of one discrete argument , is in fact the general solution of ( [ dwaveequ ] ) .",
    "given a boundary value problem for the continuous equation ( [ waveequ ] ) , we can restrict the boundary conditions to the discrete boundary points and find the discrete functions @xmath15 .",
    "then , from the form of the solution ( [ dwesol ] ) it is clear that @xmath23 will coincide , on lattice points , with the solution of the original boundary value problem .",
    "this is what we call the exact solution property of the discretization ( [ dwaveequ ] ) .    like in the continuous case ,",
    "the lines @xmath24 are characteristics of eq .",
    "( [ dwaveequ ] ) .",
    "it is easily checked that the gauge conditions ( [ wegaugefix ] ) are compatible with ( [ dwaveequ ] ) , in the sense that if the discretized gauge conditions ( [ dwegaugefix ] ) hold at some point @xmath5 , then the evolution equation ( [ dwaveequ ] ) guarantees that they hold everywhere along the characteristic that intersects the point @xmath5 .",
    "however , the exact solutions of the equations ( [ waveequ])@xmath25([wegaugefix ] ) do not necessarily satisfy ( [ dwegaugefix ] ) for any discretization step @xmath17 , because the continuous constraint ( [ wegaugefix ] ) imposed on the derivative of @xmath15 is non - linear and does not integrate to a discrete constraint ( [ dwesolconstr ] ) . in this sense , the discrete constraints ( [ dwegaugefix ] ) provide only an approximate solution of ( [ wegaugefix ] ) .",
    "we have shown that a particular discretization ( [ dwaveequ ] ) of the wave equation exactly solves  the corresponding continuum equation , regardless of the magnitude of the lattice step @xmath17 .",
    "the remaining part of this work is intended to explain and explore this unexpected phenomenon .",
    "the `` mysterious '' cancellation of all higher - order terms in ( [ dweseries ] ) is due to conformal invariance , as will be explored in the next two sections .",
    "since the exact solution property is independent of the discretization step @xmath19 , we are motivated to explore some kind of scale invariance in the model .",
    "we first notice that eq .",
    "( [ dwaveequ ] ) does not mix the values of the field on `` even '' and `` odd '' sublattices , each sublattice consisting of points with @xmath26 even or odd .",
    "therefore we shall further consider only one of these two sublattices , which is itself a square lattice in the lightcone coordinates @xmath27 . in fig .  1 we drew four adjacent squares , each square corresponding to a group of four adjacent points on the lightcone lattice with the field values @xmath28 related by ( [ dwaveequ ] ) , for instance @xmath29 by adding together the corresponding equations of motion for all four squares in fig .",
    "1 , it is straightforward to show that the same equation actually holds for points @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 that lie at the vertices of a larger @xmath34 square , i.e. @xmath35    in a similar fashion we find that the discrete equation ( [ dwaveequ ] ) remains valid if we replace the discretization step @xmath17 by its multiple @xmath36 , which means removing all but @xmath37-th points from the lattice , and effectively stretching the lattice scale by a factor of @xmath37",
    ". we could call this fact _ scale invariance _ of the discrete equations .",
    "in fact , an even more general kind of invariance holds : namely , eq .",
    "( [ dwaveequ ] ) retains its form when applied to the four vertices of any rectangle on the lightcone lattice ( i.e. with sides parallel to the null directions ; such a rectangle would have its sides parallel to the @xmath38 axes ) .",
    "one can prove this by noticing that , by adding eq .",
    "( [ dwaveequ ] ) applied to points @xmath39 and @xmath40 , one obtains @xmath41 which is the same equation applied to points @xmath42 which lie at vertices of a rectangle rather than a square .",
    "the same procedure shows that eq .",
    "( [ dwaveequ ] ) applies to points @xmath43 as well . after deriving ( [ dwaveequ ] ) for the `` elementary '' @xmath44 rectangles ,",
    "it is clear that , for any given rectangle , one only needs to add together the relation ( [ dwaveequ ] ) for all squares inside it to obtain the same relation for the vertices of the rectangle .",
    "the fact that eq .",
    "( [ dwaveequ ] ) applies to vertices of any lattice rectangle means that if we remove all points lying on any number of lines @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the lattice , the discrete equations will still apply to the remaining points . in lightcone",
    "coordinates , such a transformation amounts to replacing the ( discrete ) coordinates @xmath47 by functions of themselves : @xmath48 here , the functions @xmath49 are arbitrary monotonically increasing discrete - valued functions of one discrete argument .",
    "the monotonicity of these functions is necessary to preserve causal relations on the spacetime .",
    "we immediately notice a similarity between ( [ dctrans ] ) and conformal transformations in a two - dimensional pseudo - euclidean space .",
    "as is well known , the wave equation ( [ waveequ ] ) allows arbitrary conformal transformations of the world - sheet coordinates , @xmath50 this is the most general form of the coordinate transformation that preserves the pseudo - euclidean metric @xmath51 up to a conformal factor",
    ". transformations ( [ dctrans ] ) are obviously the discrete analog of conformal transformations ( [ twodcoordchange ] ) on the lightcone lattice .    we have , therefore , found that the discrete wave equation ( [ dwaveequ ] ) is invariant under the discrete conformal transformations ( [ dctrans ] ) .",
    "we shall refer to this as the _ discrete conformal invariance _ ( dci ) of the discrete wave equation .",
    "the natural question is then whether there exist other equations with the property of dci , and whether such equations also deliver exact solutions of their continuous limits . in the remaining sections",
    ", we will answer this question in the positive , establishing a relation between the exact solution property and dci .",
    "note that the constraint equations ( [ dwegaugefix ] ) do not preserve their form under discrete conformal transformations .",
    "for instance , if the constraints hold for some step size @xmath17 , @xmath52",
    "^2=0,\\quad \\left [ x^\\mu \\left ( \\tau , \\sigma + \\delta \\right ) -x^\\mu \\left ( \\tau -\\delta , \\sigma + 2\\delta \\right ) \\right ] ^2=0,\\ ] ] it does not follow in general that they also hold for step size @xmath53 : @xmath54 ^2\\neq 0.\\ ] ] accordingly , as we have seen in the previous section , the discrete constraint equations do not exactly solve their continuous counterparts .",
    "to try to generalize eq .",
    "( [ dwaveequ ] ) , we write the generic discrete evolution equation on a square lightcone lattice as @xmath55 ,   \\label{devol}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is an unknown function . as we have found in the previous section , the property of dci will be satisfied if ( [ devol ] ) is invariant under the `` elementary '' conformal transformations , that is , if the relation ( [ devol ] ) is valid when applied to the vertices of all @xmath57 lattice rectangles .",
    "this requirement can be written as two functional conditions on @xmath58 :    [ dciconds ] @xmath59 here , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are arbitrary field values which may be scalar or vector ( or even belong to a non - linear manifold of a lie group , as in our examples below ) , and @xmath56 is a similarly valued function . before we try to solve these conditions for @xmath56 , we would like to show that for any function @xmath58 satisfying ( [ dciconds ] ) , the discrete evolution equation ( [ devol ] ) exactly solves its continuous limit .",
    "the continuous limit of ( [ devol ] ) is obtained by expanding it in powers of @xmath17 , for instance    @xmath60    and with the assumption that @xmath61 , which is natural if we suppose that a constant function @xmath62 must be a solution of ( [ devol ] ) , we obtain the following equations corresponding to first and second powers of @xmath17 : @xmath63 @xmath64 here , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are derivatives of @xmath56 with respect to its three numbered arguments ( which are in general vector arguments , but we suppressed the indices in the above equations ) .",
    "one can easily verify that for @xmath67 , these equations give the usual wave equation ( [ waveequ ] ) .",
    "the derivatives @xmath65 and @xmath68 are constrained by eqs .",
    "( [ dciconds ] ) .",
    "for example , the first derivatives satisfy @xmath69 where @xmath65 are understood as linear operators on the tangent target space .",
    "it follows that @xmath65 are projection operators ( i.e. operators @xmath70 that obey @xmath71 ) with eigenvalues @xmath72 and @xmath73 only .",
    "now we shall show that the equations ( [ contequ1])@xmath25([contequ2 ] ) are exactly solved by ( [ devol ] ) if the dci  conditions ( [ dciconds ] ) hold .",
    "denote the exact solution of the continuous equations ( [ contequ1])@xmath74([contequ2 ] ) by @xmath75 , and the solution of the discrete equation ( [ devol ] ) by @xmath76 . here ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are discrete lattice coordinates , and we assume that @xmath77 on the lines @xmath78 ( fig .  2 ) . since eqs .",
    "( [ contequ1])@xmath25([contequ2 ] ) were obtained from ( [ devol ] ) by expansion in @xmath17 up to third - order terms , @xmath79 satisfies the discrete equation ( [ devol ] ) up to @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 in the limit of small @xmath17 .",
    "now we shall scale up the lattice by an arbitrarily chosen factor of @xmath37 .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , from dci it follows that eq .",
    "( [ devol ] ) applies also to the vertices of an @xmath82 square on the lightcone lattice , and this is a consequence of using eq .",
    "( [ devol ] ) @xmath83 times , once for each `` elementary '' square . at each elementary square",
    ", we can replace the field values @xmath84 by @xmath79 and introduce an error of @xmath85 .",
    "an error of @xmath86 in @xmath87 entails an error of not more than @xmath88 in @xmath89 , because the first derivatives of @xmath56 are operators with eigenvalues of @xmath72 and @xmath73 only .",
    "therefore , replacing @xmath84 by @xmath79 in the @xmath90 square entails an error in @xmath91 of not more than @xmath92 : @xmath93 however , we can also apply ( [ cubeerror ] ) directly to the @xmath82 square to obtain @xmath94 it means that @xmath95 which forces @xmath96 since @xmath97 is a polynomial in @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the approximation ( [ cubeerror ] ) is in fact exact .",
    "this argument shows that it was in fact only necessary to expand ( [ devol ] ) up to second order in @xmath17 , and all higher - order terms will lead to differential equations which are consequences of ( [ contequ1])@xmath25([contequ2 ] ) , just as we have seen in the case of the wave equation .",
    "it also shows that the differential equations corresponding to given dci field equations ( [ devol ] ) are always second - order or lower .",
    "using the evolution equation ( [ devol ] ) , one can write the exact solution of the continuous equations for boundary conditions on the lightcone @xmath98 . to find @xmath99 at a point @xmath100 within the future lightcone of the origin",
    ", we construct a lattice that has @xmath5 as one of its points , and then apply eq .",
    "( [ devol ] ) to the rectangle @xmath101 and explicitly write @xmath99 through the boundary values : @xmath102    now we try to describe a general class of functions @xmath56 satisfying ( [ dciconds ] ) .",

    "( [ dciconds ] ) that @xmath103 if we denote @xmath104 the above will look like an associative law for a binary operation @xmath105 : @xmath106 the condition @xmath107 looks like a unity law @xmath108 although it does nt follow from ( [ dciconds ] ) that @xmath109 for all @xmath31 .",
    "however , if we suppose that ( [ multi ] ) is actually an operation of group multiplication , with the usual unity law @xmath110 and the inverse operation @xmath111 , then it is shown in the appendix that there exists a reparametrization @xmath112 of the field values such that the operation @xmath105 is written as @xmath113 where by @xmath114 we denote the group multiplication in the group of field values .",
    "note that although eq .",
    "( [ genm ] ) is not symmetric with respect to interchange of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , such interchange is equivalent to a reparametrization @xmath115 ( where @xmath116 is the group inverse of @xmath30 ) .",
    "we arrive at a picture of a field equation of the type ( [ devol ] ) , derived from a group multiplication in an arbitrary lie group .",
    "we shall assume that any needed reparametrization is already effected , and that the evolution is directly given by ( [ devol ] ) with @xmath117 for example , if we consider a vector space as an abelian group with addition of vectors as the operation @xmath114 , we again obtain the formula @xmath118 for the discrete wave equation .    in view of eq .",

    "in this section we present some examples to illustrate the constructions of sec .",
    "[ secgen ] and to give a physical interpretation of the field theories arising from them .",
    "as was noted in the previous section , we can obtain the discrete wave equation by using the general formula ( [ genf ] ) on a vector space considered as an additive group of vectors .",
    "since all commutative lie groups are locally isomorphic to a vector space , we should take a non - commutative group to find a less trivial example .",

    "a calculation shows that the continuous limit of the discrete evolution equation ( [ genf ] ) with the composition law ( [ twodmc ] ) is ( in lightcone coordinates @xmath47 )    [ twodme ] @xmath135 note that the non - commutativity of the group leads to asymmetry with respect to the spatial reflection ( i.e. interchange of @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) , but at the same time spatial reflection is equivalent to reparametrization @xmath138 @xmath139 which corresponds to taking the inverse matrix to ( [ matrixtwod ] ) .    the exact solution of ( [ twodme ] ) is obtained from the general formula ( [ exactsol ] ) :    @xmath140    with arbitrary functions @xmath141 and @xmath142 .    the equations ( [ twodme ] ) were obtained from a two - dimensional group and describe a pair of coupled scalar fields .",
    "more generally , one may start with an arbitrary @xmath37-dimensional non - commutative group @xmath121 and construct the corresponding discrete and continuous equations describing @xmath37 coupled scalar fields .",
    "the group structure will then be reflected in the coupling of the fields : for example , if the group @xmath121 has a commutative subgroup @xmath143 , then the corresponding parameters will satisfy a free wave equation .",
    "this can be easily seen from the example above : the elements of the form @xmath144 form a commutative subgroup , and the corresponding equation ( [ twodmealpha ] ) for @xmath145 is a wave equation .",
