    "competition for resources is a central paradigm in ecology , epidemiology and social sciences @xcite .",
    "it is also ubiquitous in physics , for example in the context of mode competition in lasers @xcite , or the competition for the material among droplets of the minority phase in the process of ostwald ripening @xcite .",
    "competition among different strains of a disease for a pool of susceptible individuals ( or for resources of a single individual infected with multiple strains ) arises naturally in outbreaks of infectious diseases .",
    "this is because diseases commonly occur in multiple strains that result from mutations @xcite .",
    "citing a recent review @xcite ,  multiple - strain infections have been shown unambiguously in 51 human pathogens ( and 21 non - human ones ) and are likely to arise in most pathogen species .... competition and mutualism between strains change pathogen and disease dynamics and promote pathogen evolution . \"",
    "it is , therefore , important to understand how different strains compete among themselves .",
    "one way of achieving this goal is to use mathematical models of spread of infectious diseases in populations .",
    "two basic models of this type , and their extensions , have been especially popular : the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) and the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model @xcite . in the sis model",
    "an individual can be in either of the two states , and can transit from the susceptible to infected state upon a contact with another infected , or recover and become susceptible again . in the sir model with population turnover ,",
    "an infected individual can be removed ( leave , recover with immunity or die ) , while the susceptibles are removed and renewed . the basic reproduction number @xmath0 , which is the average number of new infectives produced by an infected host in a fully susceptible population , is given in both of these models by the rate of infectivity divided by the rate of recovery .",
    "these two simple models have been extended in different directions @xcite .",
    "one direction is to incorporate multiple strains of disease @xcite .",
    "this paper continues this line of research by studying stochastic competition between two strains in the context of the sis model and the sir model with population turnover .",
    "we focus on the important special case when both strains have identical values of @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the rate of infectivity of the first strain is a fraction of the rate of infectivity of the second strain , and the rate of recovery of the first strain is the same fraction of the rate of recovery of the second strain .",
    "thus , one strain may be labeled as the `` faster '' , and the other as the `` slower '' .",
    "this situation with different rates but identical @xmath0 has been termed `` quasi - neutral '' , since the strains are only neutral in the deterministic limit @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for evolutionary arguments for importance of the quasi - neutral case . in the quasi - neutral case",
    "small fluctuations due to the finite size of the population ( which we call the shot noise ) have a much stronger impact on the long - time behavior of the disease , than in the cases with different @xmath0 . in the deterministic limit",
    "each of the two models exhibits a coexistence line ( cl ) , which is a line of fixed points .",
    "the shot noise qualitatively changes the dynamics - the system effectively performs random walk along the cl , resulting ultimately in the extinction of one of the strains , usually referred to as fixation of the other strain .",
    "the mean time for fixation scales with the characteristic population size @xmath1 @xcite .    the previous works on quasi - neutral competition @xcite dealt with two - population models systems .",
    "here we develop a new perturbation method that can be applied to multi - population models .",
    "the method is based on time scale separation .",
    "we use this perturbation method to study fixation in two - strain extensions of the sis and sir models : the @xmath2 model and the @xmath3 model with population turnover . a model , mathematically identical to the @xmath2 model ,",
    "was studied earlier , using a different method , in the context of population genetics @xcite , see also ref . @xcite . as the total population size in the @xmath2 model",
    "is fixed , this model is two - dimensional and simpler for analysis . for pedagogical reasons , we will introduce our perturbation method for the @xmath2 model . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we derive an effectively one - dimensional description of the dynamics of the probability distribution along the cl . apart from that",
    ", we provide an explicit description of the dynamics of the probability distribution of the sub - populations in the vicinity of the cl .",
    "our method is not limited to two - dimensional models , as we demonstrate for the intrinsically three - dimensional stochastic @xmath3 model with population turnover . here",
    "we reduce the three - dimensional model to effectively one - dimensional and determine analytically the fixation probability and the mean time to fixation .",
    "we also show , for both models , that the competitive advantage of strains depends in a somewhat peculiar way on the initial conditions .",
    "for a uniform distribution of initial conditions the slow strain is more likely to reach fixation , as observed earlier in models with a fixed total population size @xcite",
    ". the fast strain , however , is more likely to win the competition in the important situation when only a few infectives of both strains are introduced into a susceptible population .    in section [ sec :",
    "model ] we introduce the @xmath2 model and the @xmath3 models with population turnover and discuss the nature of their deterministic solutions focusing on the quasi - neutral case .",
    "our perturbation method is presented in section [ method ] that starts with a qualitative discussion of how the shot noise leads to extinction of one strain and fixation of the other .",
    "it also discusses the time scale separation that is crucial to the perturbation method .",
    "the derivation itself is presented in section [ sec:2d_calculation ] for the simpler @xmath2 model .",

    "thus , as in the @xmath2 model with @xmath18 , there is always only one globally attracting state .",
    "the time scale for reaching the vicinity of this globally - attracting state , the relaxation time scale , is determined by the eigenvalues of the attracting state and is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath27 , the non - trivial fixed points of this dynamical system obey the relations @xmath28 and form a straight line : the deterministic coexistence line ( cl ) in the three - dimensional phase space @xmath29 .    as in the @xmath2 model , when @xmath30 , the deterministic trajectories approach the cl on the fast relaxation time scale , independent of @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath2 model , here the character of fixed points making the cl can change depending on the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and , in general , on the coordinate along the cl .",
