    "the best - fit model had a temperature @xmath29 kev and a metal abundance of @xmath30 solar ( see table  [ tab : spec ] and figure  [ fig : clusspec ] ) .",
    "we also performed a spectral study to determine if a cooling flow is present in the center of abell 13 , i.e. the peak in the x - ray emission which is also coincident with galaxy h. we extracted spectra in circular annuli out to 100 from the cluster center .",
    "each spectrum was required to have at least 1000 counts .",
    "the width of the annuli ranged from 15 in the cluster center to 5 at the periphery of the cluster .",

    "the region size was determined by requiring at least 800 net ( i.e. background subtracted ) counts in the 0.47.0  kev energy range , but with a maximum box size of 183@xmath32183 acis pixels , or 90@xmath3290 .",
    "the maximum box size was only reached in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "the total counts in each region were between 1.5 and 2 times the 800 count minimum to account for background subtraction . for each spectrum ,",
    "a background spectrum was extracted from the blank sky background event file in the same region .",
    "rmf and arf files were constructed for specific locations on the ccd , with a spacing of 32 and 50 pixels , respectively .",
    "this was done to account for variations in the response across the ccd , without having to create individual rmf and arf files for each region which would be computationally demanding . for a given region ,",
    "the rmf and arf used to fit the spectrum were chosen by selecting the response files with positions closest to the count - weighted average position of the events in each region .",
    "the spectra were grouped to have 25 counts per bin and were fitted in isis using the apec thermal model .",
    "the galactic hydrogen column density , redshift , and abundance were fixed to the values found for the full cluster spectrum (   [ sec : full ] above ) . only the temperature and normalization of the apec model were allowed to vary . in general , the errors on the temperature map are about 20% in the temperature .",
    "although , for pixels with higher best - fit temperatures or those near the edge of the map , the errors are larger , in the range of 5070% .",
    "this is because of the low high - energy sensitivity of _ chandra _ and the lower statistics of the outer regions .",

    "the intensity contours for the x - ray and radio emission from abell 13 are overlaid .",
    "we note that small differences in temperature from pixel to pixel are not statistically meaningful given the errors in the fits ( an average error of 1.2  kev at 6.0  kev ) .",
    "since the fitted region size is larger than a single map pixel , there is overlap of the fitted regions .    of particular interest",
    "are the lack of very cool gas in the cluster center and the presence of cool gas associated with the radio relic region .",
    "the temperature map shows a large concentration of lower temperature gas associated with the radio relic .",
    "below (  [ sec : rad ] ) we perform a detailed spectral study of this gas to better constrain its properties .",
    "there may also be some hotter gas ( purple / blue region ) associated with the steep gradient in the x - ray surface brightness contours on the southern edge of the cluster ( see e.g. , the x - ray contours in figure  [ fig : tmap ] ) but the temperature errors are large in this region . to try and confirm this result , we extracted spectra on the northern and southern sides of the x - ray gradient .",
    "no significant difference in the best - fit temperatures was found , although both regions had large errors .",
    "higher count spectra are required to verify the increased gas temperature along the cluster s southern edge .",

    "this region has the advantage that it is a region of lower surface brightness for the hot gas component .",

    "interestingly , the two brightest galaxies , h and f , are associated with different peaks in the redshift distribution and rather than being associated with the peak velocity , either of the cluster as a whole or of either subclump , the velocities of galaxies h and f are on the very edges of the velocity distribution .",
    "galaxy f is on the lower edge for the low - velocity subcluster and galaxy h on the higher edge of the high - velocity subcluster .",
    "this , combined with the complicated structure of the x - ray emission , points to an ongoing merger within the cluster and that galaxies h and f have a significant velocity relative to the general cluster distribution .",

    "second , the radio image shows a long filament which extends almost all the way back to the brightest elliptical galaxy h ( figure  [ fig : xr ] ) .",
    "thus , we assume that the radio emitting plasma originated in an agn at the center of galaxy h. based on the classification system of @xcite , which looks at the physical properties and proposed origins of extended cluster radio sources , we would classify abell 13 as an agn relic system .",
    "we propose two explanations for the multi - wavelength properties of abell 13 .",
    "the first is the buoyant bubble scenario suggested by @xcite for abell 133 .",
    "the radio source may have uplifted the cool gas from the core of abell 13 . in this scenario ,",
    "galaxy h would have been an active radio emitter in the past . at some later time , the radio plasma would have risen by buoyancy , and entrained the cool gas in the center , uplifting it to a larger distance from the cluster center .",
    "this might also remove the source of fuel for the central agn .",
    "this would explain the lack of cool gas in the cluster center and the fact that currently , galaxy h is neither a radio ( @xmath49  mjy at 1.4  ghz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) nor a hard x - ray source .",
    "to estimate the time scale for the cool gas and radio source to rise by buoyancy from the position of galaxy h , we assume that the cool gas and radio source move at a velocity roughly 1/3 the sound speed , @xmath50 , of the hot gas component . for a 6.0  kev gas , @xmath50 is 980  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the projected separation between the relic and galaxy h is 2231 .",
    "this yields a buoyancy time scale of 7@xmath51  yr , roughly consistent with the relic age determined through spectral fitting @xcite . to estimate the mass of cool gas uplifted , we take the volume to be that of a prolate spheroid with major and minor axes equal to that of the region used to extract the spectrum of the radio relic . from the two - temperature spectral model ,",
    "we find that the enclosed mass of cool gas is @xmath52  m@xmath26 .",
    "this is a factor of 10 greater than the mass of gas contained in the tongue of x - ray gas found in abell 133 @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the electron density for the cool gas is @xmath53",
    "@xmath47 , lower than the hotter cluster gas ( particularly the gas towards the center of the cluster ) making buoyant uplift a possibility .",
    "a cool gas mass of @xmath52  m@xmath26 implies that previously abell 13 would have had a mass deposition rate of @xmath54  m@xmath26  yr@xmath8 assuming a cooling time of @xmath55  yr .",
    "this is on the low end of the distribution of known cooling flow mass deposition rates ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is only an estimate of the mass of cool gas to determine if the value is realistic .",
    "the temperature map shows additional cool regions to the north and east of the radio relic which if taken into account would increase the mass of cool gas .",
    "however , the radio relic is filamentary in structure and it is possible that the cool gas also resides in filaments rather than a single big blob , which would decrease the gas mass estimate . since it is difficult to determine the extent of either of these situations , we merely suggest that the estimated amount of cool gas in abell 13 seems reasonable for a galaxy cluster",
    ".    the lower temperature of the gas near the radio source might be due both to the lower entropy of the gas in the cool core of the cluster , plus the effects of adiabatic expansion as this gas was moved out to a lower - pressure region . from our above estimate of the electron density distribution of the cluster gas",
    ", we find that the electron density at the cluster center is @xmath116 times that at the radio relic .",
    "the pressure difference between the two locations should also be 6 times assuming a constant hot gas temperature .",
    "we assume that the cool gas component is always in pressure equilibrium with the hot gas component that dominates the cluster emission . as a result of adiabatic expansion , the temperature of the cool gas in its current location , @xmath56 is related to its initial temperature , @xmath57 , by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the pressure in the cluster core and @xmath60 is the pressure at the location of the radio relic , and the adiabatic index is @xmath61 .",
    "observationally , we found @xmath62 , giving @xmath63 for adiabatic expansion .",
    "this difference alone can not account for the cooling of the gas from the average cluster temperature of @xmath116  kev to its current temperature of @xmath64  kev .",
    "therefore , the cool gas associated with the radio relic must have been cooler than the average cluster temperature to begin with .",
    "we can estimate the initial cool gas temperature assuming that adiabatic expansion was the only heating or cooling mechanism as the cool gas was uplifted .",
    "this requires that the initial temperature of the cool gas was about @xmath65  kev when this gas was located at the cluster core .",
    "this is a reasonable temperature for a cooling core .",
    "if the relic were at a larger radius than the projected radius , then we would expect the electron density to be lower and therefore the adiabatic cooling to be stronger .",
    "this would make the initial temperature of the cool gas higher , possibly more in line with the average cluster temperature .",
    "our second proposed explanation is that a dynamical event is the origin of the unusual radio relic and disturbed x - ray morphology .",
    "both the x - ray and optical properties ( radial velocity distribution ) suggest that abell 13 is undergoing a merger event . the x - ray extension from galaxy h ( to the west )",
    "points back to the radio relic .",
    "this may imply that galaxy h is moving to the east and that the radio relic is at the former position of the galaxy .",
    "( we note that the extension may also favor the buoyant uplift scenario . )",
    "we propose that before the merger event , galaxy h had a cool core and showed agn activity .",
    "as the merger progressed , the cold core and radio lobes were displaced ( or stripped ) from the galaxy as a result of ram pressure from the gas in the other subcluster , which did not affect the stars and dark matter in galaxy h. @xcite found that the travel time from galaxy h was comparable to the estimated relic age .",
    "the long filament of radio emission leading back almost to galaxy h ( figure  [ fig : xr ] ) suggests that the agn remained active during the initial phases of this stripping process .",
    "the concentration of x - ray emission around galaxy h ( figure  [ fig : compcen ] ) suggests that the stripping process is not complete ; there is still gas around galaxy h , but it is relatively hot , perhaps due to heating processes associated with the merger .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data do not conclusively determine which of these two models is correct , or strongly reject either .",
