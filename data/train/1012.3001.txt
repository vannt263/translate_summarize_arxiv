    "diverse quantum effects in systems depending on external control parameters represent an interesting field of theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "a lot of recent attention in this field has been focused on two different types of dynamical phenomena , namely on quantum phase transitions and so - called quantum quenches .",
    "these phenomena and their mutual relation are addressed in the present work .",
    "a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) is a sudden change of the ground - state structure at a certain critical value of the control parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it can be observed as a nonanalytic evolution of the system s energy and wave function induced by an _ adiabatic _",
    "variation of the control parameter @xmath0 across the quantum critical point @xmath1 at zero temperature .",
    "first discussed in the 1970s @xcite , the qpt phenomena become very important in the context of solid state physics @xcite as well as in nuclear and many - body physics  see , e.g. , recent reviews @xcite .    a quantum quench ( qq ) represents an abrupt , _ diabatic _ change @xmath2 of the control parameter followed by a system - specific quantum relaxation process . pioneering theoretical works in this field appeared already in the late 1960s @xcite , but a really rapid growth of interest was triggered by experimental studies at the beginning of this millennium @xcite .",
    "for an extensive list of qq - related references see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the qpt and qq effects can be mutually related .",
    "if the initial state before a quench coincides with the ground state near a qpt , the dynamics after the quench depends substantially on whether the parameter change does or does not bring the system to the other quantum phase , or eventually to the narrow quantum critical region between the phases @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the quench - induced dynamics in connection with a novel concept related to quantum criticality ",
    "a so called excited - state quantum phase transition ( esqpt ) @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon represents a nonanalytic evolution of individual _ excited _ states in the system with a variable control parameter .",
    "so far , such effects have been studied mostly in integrable systems with one effective degree of freedom ( one dimensional configuration spaces ) , showing a singularity of classical dynamics at a certain energy @xcite , but they seem to exist in a much richer variety of incarnations .    the esqpts can be viewed as a reinterpretation of thermal phase transitions in the microcanonical language . the key step is a scaling of energy and other observables by a suitably defined size parameter @xmath3",
    ". let @xmath4 stands for a thermal average of the quantity in brackets at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "if the thermal fluctuation @xmath6 of the scaled energy @xmath7 vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xmath8 ( often synonymous with the classical limit @xmath9 ) , a thermal phase transition at temperature @xmath10 becomes localized at a sharp value @xmath11 of the scaled energy .",
    "this shows up as an anomalous ( nonanalytic ) of energy levels @xmath12 through the boundary @xmath13 defining the locus of esqpt points @xcite .",
    "besides the shape of individual @xmath12 curves , the excited - state transition affects also the dependence of the level density @xmath14 on the scaled energy .",
    "the function @xmath14 at @xmath15 shows a singularity whose type depends on the underlying thermal phase transition and/or on the corresponding anomaly in the associated classical phase space @xcite .",
    "since the singularity influences quantum relaxation processes in the critical region , we can anticipate a major impact of the esqpt on the qq - induced dynamics in those cases in which the energy distribution after the quench is centered near @xmath16 .    to study the above - formulated conjecture , we use three simple models .",
    "they describe a single - mode bosonic field interacting with an algebraic subsystem , which is based either on the su(1,1 ) or on the su(2 ) dynamical algebra .",
    "the su(1,1 ) model may serve as a toy for the description of formation and dissociation of diatomic molecules and bosonic atoms @xcite .",
    "the su(2 ) hamiltonian represents either the well - known dicke @xcite or jaynes - cummings @xcite ( tavis - cummings @xcite ) models of quantum optics , or may alternatively describe an interacting mixture of diatomic molecules and fermionic atoms @xcite . in this work",
    "we will adopt the former interpretation .",
    "while the su(1,1 ) model and the su(2)-based jaynes - cummings model are integrable , the su(2)-based dicke model is not .",
    "all the three models show a rather similar phase structure .",
    "first , considering the ground - state properties , it turns out that an increasing strength of interaction between the bosonic field and the algebraic subsystem drives the entire system to a quantum critical point where the ground state abruptly changes its form .",
    "we then show that this qpt is in all three models followed by a chain of esqpts and demonstrate that these have a strong impact on the character of relaxation dynamics after some fine - tuned quantum quenches  namely those leading the system to a narrow region around the critical excitation energy .",
    "the type of the esqpt and its qq signatures depends on the dimensionality of the model : they are of the strongest type ( see below for a precise definition of this concept ) for the su(1,1 ) and the su(2 ) jaynes - cummings hamiltonians , and of a softer type for the su(2 ) dicke hamiltonian .",
    "we will also see that breaking of integrability in the latter model blurs the effects of criticality in the quench dynamics .",
    "we anticipate the same general trend also in more complex situations .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sec .",

[ f_scheme ] .",
    "the hilbert space of the coupled system is identified with the tensor product @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the space of hw(1 ) spanned by the set of basis vectors @xmath28 , with @xmath29 denoting the number of @xmath18-bosons , and @xmath30 coincides with the space associated with one of the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the groups su(2 ) or su(1,1 ) .",
    "the irreps are classified by the eigenvalues @xmath31 of the respective second - order casimir invariant , @xmath32 which are parametrized as @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 integer or half - integer ) and @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 known as the bergmann index ) .",
    "the irreps are finite - dimensional in the su(2 ) case ( compact group ) and infinite - dimensional in the su(1,1 ) case ( noncompact group ) .",

    "since the group generated by the su(1,1 ) algebra is noncompact , its irreps are infinite dimensional , the generators being expressible through creation and annihilation operators @xmath48 of another type of bosons .",

    "the conservation of @xmath56 implies that the hamiltonian ( [ hsu11 ] ) represents an integrable system , which for each fixed value of @xmath56 can be associated with an effective one - dimensional configuration space ( one quantum degree of freedom ) . in the following",

    "a similar phenomenon is also observed in the nonintegrable dicke model .",
    "however , due to level repulsion the survival probability is reduced in amplitude and the critical region is much broader .",
    "away from the critical region , the survival probability and the energy distribution behave in a similar way as in the integrable models .    in spite of the differences observed in integrable and nonintegrable cases , we believe that relaxation dynamics offers clear signals of an excited - state phase transitions in the dicke type of models .",
    "the character of these transitions deserves more studies .",
