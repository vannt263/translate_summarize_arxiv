    "in recent few years new data from tjinaf on the @xmath6 elastic scattering were reported .",
    "they include the electric structure function , @xmath0 , measured with high precision up to @xmath11 @xcite and measurements of tensor polarization observables , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , up to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this data , together with data on the magnetic structure function , @xmath1 @xcite , restrict the deuteron structure at scales where quark - gluon degrees of freedom are expected to become defrozen .",
    "for example , according to optimistic estimations pqcd should start from @xmath13 of order of few @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it is nice that this prediction was confirmed by analysis of tjinaf data on @xmath0 at @xmath15 @xcite .    for further conclusions one also should consider the spin structure of the deuteron from pqcd point of view .",
    "however data on polarization observables , as well as on @xmath1 , correspond to @xmath16 , which is not enough for pqcd .",
    "this is a typical intermediate region between nucleon - meson and quark - gluon pictures , where isobar configurations , meson exchange currents and constituent quark degrees of freedom are all important @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate phenomenologically a smooth connection between nucleon - meson and pqcd regions and make predictions for @xmath1 and the polarization observables at higher @xmath13 , where pqcd should work . a parameterization which connects these two regions",
    "was proposed earlier by one of the authors ( a.p .",
    "k. ) and a.i .",
    "syamtomov @xcite .",
    "it assumes power fall off of helicity spin amplitudes at asymptotically high @xmath13 coming from quark counting rules . a new analysis of the parameterization @xcite which includes the recent tjinaf data was provided in @xcite .",
    "now we study logarithmic corrections to the power behavior .",
    "such corrections are shown to be important for the structure function @xmath0 at the highest region of tjinaf energy @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 we discuss the general structure of the helicity amplitudes for the elastic @xmath6 scattering in the light cone frame ( lcf ) and pqcd predictions for the helicity amplitudes at high @xmath13 .",
    "parameterization of the helicity amplitudes which smoothly connects regions of low and high @xmath13 is given in sect .",
    "3 . then , in sect .  4 ,",
    "the data base and fitting procedure are summarized .",
    "discussions and summary are given in sect .",
    "the main object of our analysis is the helicity amplitudes of the @xmath17 transition @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are momenta and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are helicities of the deuteron in the initial and final states , respectively .    due to gauge invariance , covariance and discrete symmetries only three of the 36 helicity amplitudes ( [ 1 ] ) are independent and one can choose different sets of independent helicity amplitudes .",
    "direct calculations , however , demonstrate that it is not so in dynamics at lcf @xcite .",
    "this phenomena was shown to come from the incompatibility of transformation properties of approximate current and a deuteron wave function used in practical calculations @xcite . as a result",
    "a non - physical dependence on orientation of light - front plane appears .",
    "thus the choice of the independent amplitudes becomes of great importance in pqcd calculations where lcf is often used .",
    "first let us define lcf as a limiting reference system where the @xmath23-projection of the incoming and outgoing deuteron is close to infinity . in lcf the momenta of the incoming and outgoing deuteron",
    "are given as follows @xmath24 with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the deuteron mass ) .",
    "the momentum of the virtual photon is given by @xmath27 and the polarization vectors for the deuteron in the initial and final states , respectively , read @xmath28 here we put @xmath29 . using the standard expression for the e.m .",
    "current matrix element @xmath30-\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left.g_3(q^2)(p+p')^{\\mu } \\frac{\\left(\\varepsilon^{\\ast}(\\lambda',p')q\\right ) \\left(\\varepsilon(\\lambda , p)q\\right)}{2m^2 } \\right\\ } \\label{current_std}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one gets the following expressions for the current plus - component @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to show that they satisfy the so - called angular condition @xmath33 and thus there are only three independent helicity amplitudes between the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "alternatively the angular condition ( [ angular_c ] ) teaches us that even at pqcd extreme there appears ( through dimensionless ratio @xmath38 ) an additional scale parameter @xmath39 , apart from the pqcd parameter @xmath40 .",
    "the charge , @xmath41 , magnetic , @xmath42 , and quadruple , @xmath43 , form factors are connected with the form factors @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 as follows @xmath47 using ( [ 00])-([11 ] ) one expresses @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 in terms of any three helicity amplitudes @xmath48 , for example @xmath49,\\\\ \\nonumber g_m & = & \\frac{1}{2{{\\cal p}}(2\\eta+1)}\\left [ j^{+}_{00}+\\frac{(2\\eta-1)}{\\sqrt{2\\eta } } j^{+}_{10}-j^{+}_{1 - 1}\\right],\\\\ \\nonumber g_q & = & \\frac{1}{2{{\\cal p}}(2\\eta+1)}\\left [ -\\frac12j^{+}_{00}+ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\eta}}j^{+}_{10}- \\frac{\\eta+1}{2\\eta}j^{+}_{1 - 1}\\right ] .",

    "from pqcd arguments one gets very simple rules to determine the power behavior of the helicity amplitudes @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "for example , it follows that the amplitude @xmath37 is a leading amplitude with an asymptotic fall off @xmath53 up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "it was also argued that in lcf the helicity flip amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath35 are suppressed as @xcite @xmath54 similar considerations give that @xmath55 which agrees with the angular condition ( [ angular_c ] ) , but only at extremely high @xmath13 , @xmath56 .    in our analysis , following arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the set @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath35 as main amplitudes , where the behavior ( [ 17]),([18 ] ) is regulated in the intermediate region only by the @xmath57 . in turn , the amplitude @xmath34 must be determined from the angular condition ( [ angular_c ] ) and thus it depends on the two scale parameters , @xmath58 and @xmath39 .",
    "following the idea of reduced nuclear amplitudes in qcd @xcite , we define the reduced helicity transition amplitudes @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 as follows : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a three - quark - cluster ( nucleon ) form factor . for the @xmath63",

    "the coefficients @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 appearing in ( [ 21 ] ) can not be calculated from pqcd and we determine them from the smooth connection of the two parametrizations at the point @xmath96",
    "in out fit we use the following data : for @xmath0 from @xcite , for @xmath1 from @xcite , and for @xmath2 from @xcite and for @xmath4 , @xmath98 from @xcite .",
    "but it must be noted that due to large errors @xmath4 , @xmath3 data are practically not informative for the fit .",
    "data for @xmath99 from @xcite are in sharp contradiction with all the wold data set and therefore were omitted from the fit .",
    "we also do not include in the data base results from @xcite because they have large errors and practically do not change the obtained results .",
    "data @xcite are somewhat lower that the world data , but due to large their uncertainties the fit is insensitive to this data .",
    "data for the @xmath100 structure function were normalized , if necessary , to our convention of the magnetic form factor .",
    "@xmath101 was considered as a parameter of the model , but the qcd cutoff parameter @xmath58 was fixed at 200 mev . in ( [ 25 ] ) we chose @xmath102 , so that the the model has 10 independent fit parameters .",
    "the fit parameters summarized in table 1 were obtained with @xmath103 for 200 data points .",
    "figs .  1 and 2 display comparison of the model with @xmath0 data . to show how far experimental data are from pqcd results in preasymptotic region we continue asymptotic behavior given by ( [ 21 ] ) to region lower than @xmath104 ( dotted line on fig .  2 and figs .  3 - 7 ) .",
    "one concludes that for @xmath0 pqcd works from @xmath13-region between 1 and 2 @xmath105 .",
    "comparison with data for @xmath1 and the polarization observables are given on figs .  3  5 .",
    "one sees that for the magnetic form factor pqcd should start from @xmath13 between 2 and 3 @xmath106 , but for the polarization observable it should start somewhat earlier , near 2 @xmath105 .",
    "7 shows results for for the charge and quadrupole form factors , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .    in summary",
    ", we give a parameterization of the deuteron form factors up to @xmath109 .",
    "asymptotic behavior of the form factors is dictated by quark counting rules and pqcd helicity rules and therefore one may hope that this parameterization can be extrapolated for higher transferred momentum .",
    "for example , the model predicts behavior of the magnetic structure function , @xmath1 , at @xmath110 which can be studied in future experiments .",
