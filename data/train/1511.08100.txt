    "markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods have already been applied to numerous problems in various fields such as physics , biochemistry , information sciences , and economics  @xcite . ever since metropolis et al . invented the mcmc method in 1953  @xcite ,",
    "many kinds of improved mcmc methods have been proposed and some of them have contributed to the development of sciences , especially to the understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena in statistical physics .    applying an mcmc method to a problem",
    "requires the preparation of a target distribution and a transition matrix in a markov chain . for ascertaining the efficiency of mcmc methods , it is important to investigate whether the distribution in a markov chain converges to the stationary target distribution rapidly and whether the correlation between samples from the markov chain is sufficiently small .",
    "the multicanonical method  @xcite and the replica - exchange monte carlo method  @xcite improve the convergence rate quantitatively by extending the target distribution .",
    "cluster algorithms , such as the swendsen - wang algorithm  @xcite and the wolff algorithm  @xcite , yield a remarkable reduction in the critical slowing down of spin systems by choosing an appropriate transition matrix with a multi - spin update .",
    "the correlation in a markov chain , which is worth considering in addition to the convergence rate , is characterized by an asymptotic variance .",
    "this asymptotic variance can be reduced by decreasing the rejection rate in a markov chain in mcmc methods with the detailed balance condition ( dbc ) ; this is known as peskun s theorem  @xcite . as mentioned in the following sections , both the convergence rate and the asymptotic variance are closely related to the second - largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix .",
    "thus , improving the efficiency in mcmc methods is equivalent to reducing the second - largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix in the corresponding markov chain .",
    "the detailed balance condition is usually imposed upon the transition matrix to guarantee that our target distribution is exactly the stationary distribution in the markov chain .",
    "conventional mcmc methods , such as the metropolis - hastings algorithm  @xcite and heat - bath method  @xcite , have been developed within the framework of the dbc .",
    "however , it is possible to construct such a markov chain without imposing the dbc because the dbc is not always necessary but sufficient to make the mcmc method work correctly .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear whether mcmc methods with the dbc are more efficient than those without the dbc .",
    "in fact , several studies have shown numerically and partly analytically that the efficiency of mcmc methods can be improved by violating the dbc in some cases  .",
    "hence mcmc methods without the dbc have been eagerly studied recently .    strategies used to violate the dbc are roughly divided into two types .",
    "one is to reduce the rejection rate in the markov chain , as proposed by suwa and todo  @xcite .",
    "they constructed a markov chain without the dbc by using a geometric allocation approach , showing numerically that their method reduces the autocorrelation time by a factor of more than 6 for four- and eight - state potts models at the transition temperature .",
    "the other strategy is to extend the state space and the target distribution  .",
    "such a strategy is called `` lifting , '' and an irreversible markov chain on the extended state space is referred to as a `` lifted '' markov chain . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite it is shown that the convergence toward the target distribution is accelerated by applying the methodology of a `` lifted '' markov chain to a simple random walk . especially in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors have reported that the dynamical critical exponent in a two - dimensional ising model and fully connected ising model can be reduced by their methods .",
    "the event - chain monte carlo ( ecmc ) algorithm  @xcite is constructed for systems of continuous degree of freedom , such as hard - sphere , more general particle systems  @xcite , and continuous spin systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , nishikawa et al . have shown numerically that the ecmc algorithm for a three - dimensional heisenberg model reduces the dynamical critical exponent down to @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "these results imply that the violation of the dbc could change the relaxation dynamics of physical quantities qualitatively .",
    "the efficiency of the violation of the dbc is partially confirmed theoretically .",
    "ichiki and ohzeki have revealed that the real part of the second - largest eigenvalue of a transition matrix decreases by violating the dbc , compared to that of a symmetrized transition matrix satisfying the dbc  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic variance is also reduced in comparison with that of the corresponding symmetrized matrix  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the symmetrized transition matrix is not always equivalent to that before violating the dbc .",
    "hence , the relation between the efficiency of mcmc methods and the violation of the dbc in general is not yet well understood .    in this paper , we focus on the skew detailed balance condition ( sdbc ) originally proposed by turitsyn et al .",
    "@xcite , which belongs to the latter strategy mentioned above .",
    "we develop an irreversible metropolis - hastings algorithm with the sdbc so that it can be applied to any general system . in general , it is quite difficult to evaluate the second - largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix of a markov chain even with the dbc .",
    "it is worth evaluating the efficiency of the algorithm in a toy model where all the eigenvalues of the matrix is explicitly written down under both the dbc and the sdbc . here by applying the proposed algorithm to a simple random walk on one dimension the efficiency of the algorithm",
    "is studied .",
    "then , we show analytically that the second - largest eigenvalue in absolute value and the asymptotic variance of the corresponding transition matrix for the random - walk problem can be reduced by imposing the sdbc .",
    "our results imply that the relaxation dynamics in a markov chain can be qualitatively changed from diffusive to ballistic by introducing the violation of the dbc , and that the violation does not always improve the efficiency .",

    "@xmath22 denotes the probability for finding a state @xmath9 at time @xmath21 .",
    "then , the time evolution of the probability distribution is described by the master equation expressed as @xmath23 and , consequently , we obtain @xmath24 which shows that the distribution at arbitrary time is completely characterized by an initial distribution and the transition matrix",
    ".      a transition matrix @xmath15 is called ergodic if there exists an integer @xmath25 such that all elements of the @xmath21th power of the transition matrix are positive . a markov chain characterized by an ergodic transition matrix",
    "is ensured to have a unique stationary distribution .",
    "it is guaranteed that @xmath26 converges to our desired distribution @xmath27 as @xmath28 for arbitrary initial distributions by imposing the ergodicity and the balance condition ( bc ) , which is expressed as @xmath29 . in practice ,",
    "the dbc , which is given by @xmath30 is widely imposed as a sufficient condition of the bc . for instance , one can easily find the transition probability satisfying the dbc such as the metropolis - hastings type  @xcite and the heat - bath type  @xcite .",
    "the dbc is also called a reversibility and a markov chain satisfying the dbc is referred to as a reversible markov chain .",
    "in contrast , a markov chain without the dbc is called an irreversible markov chain .",
    "the metropolis - hastings algorithm  @xcite , one of the most famous mcmc algorithms , numerically performs the reversible markov chain explained in the previous subsection . in this subsection , we describe the metropolis - hastings algorithm to fix our notation .",

    "the convergence rate and the variance of the estimator strongly depend on the target distribution , the choice of the transition matrix , and the quantity to be estimated , although the estimation is proven to be accurate by increasing @xmath44 , irrespective of these other factors .      in this subsection",

    "a similarity transformation of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 the eigenvalues of @xmath55 coincide with those of @xmath15 including multiplicity because the similarity transformation does not change the characteristic polynomial of @xmath15 . in addition",
