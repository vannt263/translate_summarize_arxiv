    "in 1978 ya . pesin proved that a hyperbolic volume preserving diffeomorphism @xmath0 on a compact riemannian manifold @xmath1 admits at most countably many ergodic components ( mod 0 ) by showing that almost every ergodic component has positive volume ( @xcite ) . here",
    "hyperbolicity means nonzero lyapunov exponents almost everywhere .",
    "however , an example of a system which has infinitely many ergodic components was unknown till 2000 when d. doglopyat , ya .",
    "pesin and h. hu constructed a diffeomorphism of the 3-dimensional torus that satisfies the properties stated above ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the construction starts with a product @xmath2 of a two dimensional toral automorphism @xmath3 and the identity map on a circle , @xmath4 .",
    "the space is then partitioned into countably many subsets , @xmath5\\big)$ ] the diffeomorphism is then obtained by applying two small perturbations on each subset , one for ergodicity , and the other one for hyperbolicity .",
    "the latter one is a perturbation which removes the zero lyapunov exponent along the interval direction .",
    "since the original map @xmath2 is a product of anosov and identity , the resulting map will be away from the identity . in this paper",
    "we construct a system satisfying the properties in @xcite in the proximity of the identity map .",
    "our map is a perturbed geodesic flow on a surface of constant negative curvature instead of a toral automorphism .",
    "we will need three perturbations instead of two since there are two zero lyapunov exponents to remove .",
    "there are two difficulties in this construction .",
    "first , to obtain ergodicity we need accessibility . for this purpose",
    "we need to show that almost every point is accessible to a given central leaf along the interval direction .",
    "since both strong stable and unstable leaves are one dimensional , the accessibility is easy to achieve in a three dimensional space as in @xcite and extra work is necessary in our case because the space we work with is four dimensional .",
    "second , the technique to remove the second zero lyapunov exponent is more delicate . while we change the last lyapunov exponent , we need to keep all other exponents nonzero at the same time .",
    "but the direction corresponding to the `` small '' nonzero exponent obtained by the earlier perturbation is not stable under perturbation .",
    "our results show that systems which are hyperbolic , volume preserving , and with countably many ergodic components exist in any neighborhood of the identity",
    ". however , the phenomenon may not be true for other properties of dynamical systems .",
    "for example , it is generally believed that there is no uniformly hyperbolic ( anosov ) system in a neighborhood of the identity .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our theorem with the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they show that on any manifold @xmath1 of dimensional at least two , there are open sets of volume preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 , all of which have positive measure sets on which all of the lyapunov exponents are zero . in the terminology used in @xcite",
    ", they prove that there are open sets of _ neutral _ volume preserving diffeomorphisms _ away _ from the identity , while we show that there are _ ( fully ) nonuniformly hyperbolic _",
    "systems _ near _ identity .",
    "we prove the following result .",
