    "the network growth literature was commenced by the seminal barabsi - albert model posited initially in  @xcite .",
    "the motivation of studying the evolution of networks is to grasp underlying mechanisms that drive the growth process , which ramify into observable macro properties ( such as a power - law degree distribution in the case of the barabsi - albert model ) .",
    "examples of other growth models include models with edge growth  @xcite , aging effects  @xcite , node deletion  @xcite , accelerated growth  @xcite , copying  @xcite , and fitness - based models  @xcite .",
    "these models are all purely structural , that is , the connectivity of new nodes is determined by factors that depend on time or structural measures of the network .    in all the examples mentioned above , the prototypical way of analyzing a network growth model is as follows : a micro growth mechanism is devised ( for example for the barabsi - albert model , nodes enter sequentially and attach to existing nodes with degree - proportional probabilities ) , then the evolution of a desired quantity , such as the degree distribution is quantified ( e.g. , via a rate equation ) , then the equations are simplified in the long time limit ( the limit as @xmath0 ) , and then they are solved to yield steady - state quantities of interest .",
    "the practical shortcoming of such an approach is that no real network has infinite size , and the assumption of equilibrium is unrealistic for most networks .",
    "note that this can lead to crucial methodological consequences concerning the falsifiability of the model .",
    "for example , consider the barabsi - albert model .",
    "it predicts that in the steady state , the network will exhibit a power law . in this case , if we take a real network and show that its degree distribution does not follow a power law , this will not refute the theory because one could counter with the contention that the network ( no network , in fact ) has infinite size , so the network at hand does not have the necessary condition ( i.e. , infinite size ) for the prediction that theory provides .    to alleviate this shortcoming and to remedy the falsifiability caveat",
    ", we proposed an alternative approach : focusing on the temporal evolution of the network for a given growth model . that is , instead of solving for the quantities of interest in the steady - state , solve for them in arbitrary times and for initial conditions . this way ,",
    "for a given real network , an arbitrary point in time can be considered the origin of time and the network at that instant will constitute the initial condition .",
    "then observations on the temporal evolution of desired quantities can be compared to the theoretical prediction , in order to assess the theory .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on a shifted - linear preferential growth mechanism .",
    "we find the expected degree distribution as a function of time , for arbitrary initial conditions and arbitrary times .",
    "the results are corroborated with monte carlo simulations throughout the paper .",
    "the growth process starts from a given initial network with @xmath1 nodes and @xmath2 links , with known degree distribution @xmath3 .",
    "the network grows via the successive addition of new nodes . at each time",
    "step a new node is born , and it forms @xmath4 links to existing nodes , according to the preferential linking : the probability that an existing node @xmath5 receives a link from the new node at time @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the degree of node @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , and @xmath9 is the initial attractiveness , a positive constant of the model . to obtain normalized probabilities , we need to divide @xmath7 for each @xmath5 by the sum of this quantity over every node .",
    "the sum over @xmath10 yields twice the number of links at time @xmath6 , which is @xmath11 .",
    "the sum over @xmath9 yields @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of nodes at time @xmath6 , which equals @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the probability that node @xmath5 receives a link emanated from the newly - born node equals @xmath15 hereinafter , we will denote @xmath16 by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 by @xmath19 . so   transforms into @xmath20",
    "at each timestep , we can quantify the expected the change in @xmath21 , which is the number of nodes in the network that have degree @xmath22 at time @xmath6 .",
    "the value of @xmath21 can be altered if at time @xmath6 , an existing node with degree @xmath22 receives a link from the newly - born node ( which would increment the degree of the receiving node to @xmath23 , decrementing @xmath24 ) , or if an existing node with degree @xmath25 receives a link ( which would increment the degree of the receiving node to @xmath22 , incrementing @xmath24 ) . for each incoming node ,",
    "@xmath26 increments .",
    "the following rate equation quantifies the evolution of @xmath21 :    @xmath27 +    \\delta_{k,\\beta}.                        \\label{nk_dot_0 }                     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this can be rearranged and expressed equivalently as follows    @xmath28 +   \\delta_{k,\\beta}.                        \\label{nk_dot_00 }                     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is a two - dimensional difference equation in time and @xmath22 .",
    "we now employ a time - continuous approximation to this equation and replace it with the following difference - differential equation :    @xmath29 +    \\delta_{k,\\beta}.                        \\label{nk_dot }                     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the relative error of this approximation at each timestep is proportional to @xmath30 . even for short times",

    "note that 100 links is tiny as compared to many real networks , such as social and biological networks , citation and collaboration networks , the web and other online networks .",
    "the typical size of these networks are way larger than 100 , so the approximation will be conservative in real settings . in monte carlo simulations",

    "we verified the theoretical predictions with monte carlo simulations .",
    "plausible extensions to this result include moving beyond the expected degree distribution , and obtaining the distribution of degree distributions .",
    "this is essential for devising rigorous statistical tests to assess network growth mechanisms upon observing longitudinal data on the degree distribution . for a given initial network",
    ", there are various paths that the system can take , due to the random nature of the growth process .",
    "what we obtained in this paper is the average over all those paths .",
