    "when a robotic vehicle equipped with a vision sensor is manoeuvering in a built environment , consisting primarily of planar or near planar surfaces , then the nature of the environment can be exploited in the vision processing algorithms .",
    "different images of the same planar surface are related by homography mappings , and homographies have been used extensively in robotic applications as a vision primitive .",
    "homography - based algorithms have been used for estimation of the rigid - body pose of a vehicle equipped with a camera @xcite .",
    "navigation of robotic vehicles has been developed based on homography sequences @xcite and one of the most successful visual servo control paradigms uses homographies @xcite .",
    "homography - based methods are particularly well suited to navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles @xcite where the ground terrain is viewed from a distance and the relief of surface features is negligible compared to the vehicles distance from the scene .",
    "computing homographies from point correspondences has been extensively studied in the last fifteen years @xcite .",
    "the quality of the homography estimate obtained depends heavily on the number and quality of the data points used in the estimation as well as the algorithm employed . for a well textured scene",
    ", the state - of - the - art methods can provide high quality homography estimates at the cost of significant computational effort ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for a scene with poor texture , and consequently few reliable feature point correspondences , existing homography estimation algorithms perform poorly .",
    "robotic vehicle applications , however , provide temporal sequences of images and it seems natural to exploit the temporal correlation rather than try to compute individual raw homographies for each pair of frames .",
    "zhang @xcite used image flow computed from a pair of images to compute the relative homography , although this method still only considers isolated pairs of images . in recent work by the authors @xcite a nonlinear observer @xcite for homography estimation was proposed based on the group structure of the set of homographies , the special linear group @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this observer uses velocity information to interpolate across a sequence of images and improve the individual homography estimates .",
    "the observer proposed in @xcite still requires individual image homographies to be computed for each image , which are then smoothed using filtering techniques .",
    "although this approach @xcite provides improved homography estimates , it comes at the cost of running both a classical homography algorithm as well as the temporal filter algorithm , and only functions if each pair of images has sufficient data available to compute a raw homography .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the question of deriving an observer for a sequence of image homographies that takes image point feature correspondences directly as input .",
    "the proposed approach takes a sequence of images associated with a continuous variation of the reference image , the most common case being a moving camera viewing a planar scene , a situation typical of robotic applications .",
    "the proposed nonlinear observer is posed on the special linear group @xmath0 , that is in one - to - one correspondence with the group of homographies @xcite , and uses velocity measurements to propagate the homography estimate and fuse this with new data as it becomes available @xcite .",
    "a key advance on prior work by the authors is the formulation of a point feature innovation for the observer that incorporates point correspondences directly in the observer without requiring reconstruction of individual image homographies .",
    "this saves considerable computational resources and makes the proposed algorithm suitable for embedded systems with simple point tracking software .",
    "in addition , the algorithm is well posed even when there is insufficient data for full reconstruction of a homography .",
    "for example , if the number of corresponding points between two images drops below four it is impossible to algebraically reconstruct an image homography and the existing algorithms fail @xcite . in such situations , the proposed observer will continue to operate , incorporating what information is available and relying on propagation of prior estimates where necessary . finally , even if a homography can be reconstructed from a small set of feature correspondences , the estimate is often unreliable and the associated error is difficult to characterize .",
    "the proposed algorithm integrates information from a sequence of images , and noise in the individual feature correspondences is filtered through the natural low - pass response of the observer , resulting in a highly robust estimate . as a result , the authors believe that the proposed observer is ideally suited for estimation of homographies based on small windows of image data associated with specific planar objects in a scene , poorly textured scenes , and real - time implementation ; all of which are characteristic of requirements for homography estimation in robotic vehicle applications .    the paper is organized into seven sections including the introduction and the concluding sections .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] presents a brief recap of the lie group structure of the set of homographies . in section  [ sec : observer ] , based on a recent advanced theory for nonlinear observer design @xcite , a nonlinear observer on @xmath1 is proposed using direct measurements of known inertial directions and the knowledge of the group velocity .",

    "the results show excellent performance even in the case of very fast camera motion ( relative to frame rate ) , severe occlusion , and in the presence of specular reflections .",
    "visual data is obtained via a projection of an observed scene onto the camera image surface .",
    "the projection is parameterised by two sets of parameters : intrinsic ( `` internal '' parameters of the camera such as the focal length , the pixel aspect ratio , etc . ) and extrinsic ( the pose , i.e. the position and orientation of the camera ) .",
    "let @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "@xmath3 ) denote projective coordinates for the image plane of a camera @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) , and let @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) denote its ( right - hand ) frame of reference .",

    "the pose of the camera determines a rigid body transformation from @xmath7 to @xmath6 ( and visa versa ) .",
    "one has @xmath11 as a relation between the coordinates of the same point in the reference frame ( @xmath12 ) and in the current frame ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "if the camera is calibrated ( the intrinsic parameters are known ) , then all quantities can be appropriately scaled and the equation is written in a simple form : @xmath20      since homographies describe image transformations of _ planar _ scenes , we begin by fixing a plane that contains the points of interest ( target points ) .    assume a calibrated camera and that there is a planar surface @xmath21 containing a set of @xmath22 target points ( @xmath23 ) so that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the unit normal to the plane expressed in @xmath6 and @xmath26 is the distance of the plane to the origin of @xmath27 .    from the rigid - body relationships  , one has @xmath28 .",

    "since all target points lie in a single planar surface one has @xmath30 and thus , using  , the projected points obey @xmath31 the projective mapping @xmath32 , @xmath33 is termed a homography and it relates the images of points on the plane @xmath34 when viewed from two poses defined by the coordinate systems @xmath3 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the homography @xmath36 can be written as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the normal to the observed planar surface expressed in the frame @xmath7 and @xmath39 is the orthogonal distance of the plane to the origin of @xmath7 .",
    "one can verify that @xcite : @xmath40 the homography matrix contains the pose information @xmath41 of the camera from the frame @xmath7 ( termed current frame ) to the frame @xmath6 ( termed reference frame ) .",
    "however , since the relationship between the image points and the homography is a projective relationship , it is only possible to determine @xmath36 up to a scale factor ( using the image points relationships alone ) .",
    "recall that the special linear group @xmath0 is defined as the set of all real valued @xmath42 matrices with unit determinant : @xmath43 the lie - algebra @xmath44 for @xmath0 is the set of matrices with trace equal to zero : @xmath45 .",
    "the adjoint operator is a mapping @xmath46 defined by : @xmath47    since a homography matrix @xmath36 is only defined up to scale then any homography matrix is associated with a unique matrix @xmath48 by re - scaling @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .",
    "every such matrix @xmath48 occurs as a homography .",

    "the geometrical meaning of the above property is that the 3d motion of the camera between views @xmath57 and @xmath58 , followed by the 3d motion between views @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the same as the 3d motion between views @xmath57 and @xmath59 . as a consequence",

    "in this section , the design of an observer for @xmath66 is based on a recent theory for nonlinear observer design directly on the output space @xcite .",
    "consider the kinematics of @xmath1 given by @xmath67 with @xmath68 the group velocity .",

    "computing the time derivative of @xmath109 and using the fact that @xmath108 converges to zero and @xmath109 converges to @xmath56 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath253 using boundedness of @xmath36 , one ensures that @xmath254 .",
    "the proposed homography observers have been experimentally evaluated using an avt stingray 125b camera and an xsens mti - g imu attached together . this sensor system , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensorrefimage ] , is also the one used in @xcite .",
    "the imu runs at @xmath255 hz and only the gyroscope measurements are used for feeding the observer .",
    "the camera provides 40 frames per second at a resolution of @xmath256 pixels .",
    "it makes use of a theia sy125 m wide - angle lens whose estimated intrinsic parameters are @xmath257 pixels for the focal length and @xmath258 pixels for the principle point .",
    "the reference target for the visual system is the image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensorrefimage ] printed on a @xmath259 @xmath260 sheet of paper and then placed over a planar surface parallel to the ground . for simplicity , the point - features extracted from the images are only the 4 corners of the target whenever they are visible in the field of view of the camera .",
    "this is the minimum number of points necessary for algebraically reconstructing the homography matrix @xcite .",
    "we have chosen this simplistic scenario as a first experiment to be able to demonstrate the performance of our proposed observer algorithms independent of potential problems with feature detection , matching and tracking in the real image data .",
    "the latter is not the focus of this paper .",
    "the next section describes a more realistic experiment where failures of the image processing stage occur .",
    "there are a plethora of methods for feature detection and feature matching reported in the computer vision literature , the quality of which directly impacts on the precision of the estimated homography .",
    "since this issue is not the main preoccupation of the present study , we have opted to use an efficient second - order minimization ( esm ) dense approach @xcite to directly estimate the homography matrix for simulated `` ground - truth '' comparison and also for computing the image coordinates of the 4 corners of the target .",
    "the experimental results reported next correspond to the observer  whose gains are chosen as @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "let us emphasize that measurements of linear velocity are not available for the observer in this experiment .",
    "we have performed a hand - held movement of the camera such that the target s corners frequently exit the camera s field of view .",
    "[ fig : nbrobspoints ] shows that the number of extracted point - features drops below @xmath78 at multiple instances and for extended periods of time .",
    "these critical cases allow us to test the robustness of the proposed observer .",
    "[ fig : costfunction ] shows the time evolution of the cost function @xmath263 related to the homography error , cf . .",
    "the `` ground - truth '' point locations @xmath112 are simulated using the esm  homography .",
    "[ fig : estimatedhomography ] illustrates the time evolution of the homography estimated by the proposed observer and of the simulated `` ground - truth '' homography obtained by the esm algorithm .",
    "the first video in the supplementary multimedia material presents the image sequence with highlighted red point - features , a green quadrilateral joining the estimates of the 4 corners of the target , a warped current image , together with the time evolution of the cost function @xmath264 .",
    "the video is also available at @xcite .",
    "observe from figs .",
    "[ fig : costfunction ] and [ fig : estimatedhomography ] that during the initial transient ( before @xmath265s ) the cost function @xmath264 converges quickly and then remains close to zero for the following eleven seconds .",
    "the estimated homography also converges quickly and remains close to the simulated `` ground - truth '' esm  homography .",
    "the occasional loss of point - features during that period only marginally affects the overall performance of the proposed observer .",
    "after that first period , there are three periods where the precision of the estimated homography is significantly deteriorated due to the loss of extracted point - features : from @xmath266s to @xmath267s , from @xmath268s to @xmath269s , and particularly from @xmath270s to @xmath271s .",
    "whenever the number of extracted point - features is not sufficient ( @xmath272 ) , the estimated homography is updated mainly based on the forward integration of the kinematic equation using the angular velocity measurements . since the linear velocity is not measured in this experiment , strong divergence of the homography estimation error is almost inevitable in this situation .",
    "this is particularly the case for fast translational camera motion .",
    "however , once the set of extracted point - features becomes consistent again , the estimated homography quickly converges to the simulated `` ground - truth '' homography , demonstrating the robustness of the proposed observer algorithm .",
    "in this section , we present an application of our approach to image stabilization in the presence of very fast camera motion , severe occlusion and specular reflections .",
    "the experiment consists of moving a camera with attached imu rapidly in front of a planar scene as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e1 ] , top left .",
    "the aim is to track and stabilize a region of interest in the reference image , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e1 ] , bottom left .",
    "the complete result is shown in the second video provided as supplementary material and available at @xcite , which demonstrates highly robust performance under very challenging conditions .",
    "the camera used is a prototype synchronized camera - imu combination with an aptina mt9v034 cmos sensor and an analog devices adis16375 mems imu .",
    "the imu runs at @xmath255 hz , providing an angular velocity measurement to the observer .",
    "the camera provides @xmath273 frames per second at a resolution of @xmath274 pixels .",
    "the estimated camera parameters are @xmath275 pixels for the focal length and @xmath276 pixels for the principle point .",
    "point - features are extracted using the detectsurffeatures routine in matlab r2012b with the standard recommended parameter settings and matched using matlab s klt - based @xcite matchfeatures routine with a matching threshold of @xmath277 .",
    "we have purposefully avoided using more sophisticated image processing routines in order to demonstrate the raw performance of our observer .",
    "it is likely that the results could be further improved by the use of higher quality feature matching algorithms .",
    "it is quite unrealistic to track one and the same set of features through a long video sequence , in particular given the low frame rate and comparatively rapid motion in our test sequence as well as the presence of severe occlusion ( particularly strong in frames @xmath278 and frames @xmath279 ) and large specular reflections ( e.g. frames @xmath280 ) .",
    "we have hence opted to match features between the reference image and each subsequent frame separately . to do this",
    ", we first forward integrate the observer equations  using only the gyroscope measurements , i.e. setting the observer gains @xmath114 ( @xmath281 ) and @xmath234 to zero .",
    "we then use the resulting homography estimate to transform the current image before we apply feature extraction and matching .",
    "a klt - based matching algorithm is well suited to this approach since it favors translational motion over rotational motion , and most of the rotational motion has already been compensated for by forward integrating the angular velocity .",
    "we remove remaining @xmath22-to-@xmath265 matches ( an artefact of matlab s klt implementation ) and apply a conservative symmetric bandpass median filter ( 60% passband ) for outlier removal .",
    "again , we have purposefully avoided the use of more sophisticated ( and much more computationally expensive ) alternatives such as ransac @xcite .",
    "finally , we use observer gains of @xmath282 ( @xmath281 ) and @xmath283 to rapidly iterate the observer equations @xmath284 times per video frame . the computational effort for this last step",
    "is negligible compared to the previous image processing steps .",
    "note that the procedure described above does not satisfy the assumptions of our theoretical convergence results , not least because different point - features are selected for every video frame .",
    "however , it is intuitively clear that such a procedure will still work as long as the selected feature set provides persistent excitation to the observer . indeed",
    ", our experimental results strongly support this claim .    the experimental results ( cf . the second video in the supplementary material and available at @xcite ) show good and robust performance throughout the entire video sequence , including the previously mentioned passages with severe occlusion and large specular reflections .",
    "even when the number of usable point - feature matches drops below four for a number of frames ( e.g. frames @xmath285 ) , or when our algorithm selects a wrong feature match ( e.g. frame @xmath286 ) , the observer continues to track the region of interest well and quickly recovers from any tracking errors .",
    "in this paper we developed a nonlinear observer for a sequence of homographies represented as elements of the special linear group @xmath0 .",
    "the observer directly uses point - feature correspondences from an image sequence without requiring explicit computation of the individual homographies between any two given images and fuses these measurements with measurements of angular velocity from onboard gyroscopes using the correct lie group geometry .",
    "the stability of the observer has been proved for both cases of known full group velocity and known rigid - body velocities only . even if the characterization of the stability domain still remains an open issue ,",
    "simulation and experimental results have been provided as a complement to the theoretical approach to demonstrate a large domain of stability .",
    "a potential application to image stabilization in the presence of very fast camera motion , severe occlusion and specular reflections has been demonstrated with very encouraging results even for a relatively low video frame rate .",
