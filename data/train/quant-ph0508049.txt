    "i start from a brief introduction to causality restrictions on the distributed measurements : the limitations that are imposed by final propagation velocity of the physical interactions .",
    "it is followed by the relativistic transformations of the states of massive particles and photons , from which we can deduce what happens to qubits which are realized as the discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "building on this , i discuss the distinguishability of quantum signals , and briefly touch communication channels and the bipartite entanglement .",
    "i do not follow a historical order or give all of the original references .",
    "a review @xcite is used as the standard reference on quantum information and relativity .",
    "the results of the  usual \" quantum information are given without any reference : all of them can be found in at least one of the sources @xcite . finally , a word about units : @xmath0 are always assumed .",

    "measurements are considered to be point - like interventions .",
    "first recall the standard description of the measurement and the induced state transformation .",

    "the probability of the outcome @xmath3 is p_=e _ , while the state transformation is given by some completely positive evolution _=_ma_ma_m^/p _ , _ m a_m^a_m = e_. if the outcome is left unknown , the update rule is = _",

    "the operations of alice and bob are given by the operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",

    "reduces to p_=(_n b_nb^_n ) , whence all the expressions involving alice s operators @xmath5 have totally disappeared .",
    "the statistics of bob s result are not affected at all by what alice may simultaneously do somewhere else .",
    "this proves that eq .",
    "( [ etcr ] ) indeed is a sufficient condition for no instantaneous information transfer . in particular , the local operations @xmath13 and @xmath14 are of this form .",
    "note that any classical communication between distant observers can be considered a kind of long range interaction .",
    "the propagation of signals is , of course , bounded by the velocity of light . as a result",
    ", there exists a partial time ordering of the various interventions in an experiment , which defines the notions earlier and later .",
    "the input parameters of an intervention are deterministic ( or possibly stochastic ) functions of the parameters of earlier interventions , but not of the stochastic outcomes resulting from later or mutually spacelike interventions @xcite .",
    "even these apparently simple notions lead to non - trivial results .",
    "consider a separable bipartite superoperator @xmath15 , t()=_k m_km_k^ , m_k = a_kb_k , where the operators @xmath16 represent operations of alice and @xmath17 those of bob .",
    "not all such superoperators can be implemented by local transformations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite .",
    "this is the foundation of the `` non - locality without entanglement '' .",
    "a classification of bipartite state transformations was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it consists of the following categories .",
    "there are _ localizable _ operations that can be implemented locally by alice and bob , possibly with the help of prearranged ancillas , but without classical comunication .",
    "ideally , local operations are instantaneous , and the whole process can be viewed as performed at a definite time",
    ". a final classical output of such distributed intervention will be obtained at some point of the ( joint ) causal future of alice s and bob s interventions . for _",
    "semilocalizable _ operations , the requirement of no communication is relaxed and one - way classical communication is possible .",
    "it is obvious that any tensor - product operation @xmath18 is localizable , but it is not a necessary condition .",
    "for example the bell measurements , which distinguishes between the four standard bipartite entangled qubit states , |^:= 12(|0|1|1|0 ) , |^:= 12(|0|0|1|1 ) , are localizable .",
    "other classes of bipartite operators are defined as follows : bob performs a local operation @xmath19 just before the global operation @xmath15 .",
    "if no local operation of alice can reveal any information about @xmath19 , i.e. , bob can not signal to alice , the operation @xmath15 is _",
    "semicausal_. if the operation is semicausal in both directions , it is _ causal_. in many cases it is easier to prove causality than localizability ( see remark 3 ) .",
    "there is a necessary and sufficient condition for the semicausality ( and therefore , the causality ) of operations @xcite .",
    "these definitions of causal and localizable operators appear equivalent .",
    "it is easily proved that localizable operators are causal .",
    "it was shown that semicausal operators are always semilocalizable @xcite . however , there are causal operations that are not localizable @xcite .",
    "it is curious that while a complete bell measurement is causal , the two - outcome incomplete bell measurement is not . indeed , consider a two - outcome pvm e_1=|^+^+| , e_2=-e_1 .",
    "if the initial state is @xmath20 , then the outcome that is associated with @xmath21 always occurs and alice s reduced density matrix after the measurement is @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "if before the joint measurement bob performs a unitary operation that transforms the state into @xmath23 , then the two outcomes are equiprobable , the resulting states after the measurement are maximally entangled , and alice s reduced density matrix is @xmath24 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that after this incomplete bell measurement two input states @xmath23 and @xmath20 are distinguished by alice with a probability of 0.75 .",
    "here is another example of a semicausal and semilocalizable measurement which can be executed with one - way classical communication from alice to bob .",
    "consider a pvm measurement , whose complete orthogonal projectors are |0|0 , |0|1 , |1|+ , |1|-,[examp1 ] where @xmath25 .",
    "the kraus matrices are a_j = e__j0[orthopvm ] , from the properties of complete orthogonal measurements @xcite , it follows that this operation can not be performed without alice talking to bob . a protocol to realize this measurement is the following .",
    "alice measures her qubit in the basis @xmath26 , and tells her result to bob . if alice s outcome was @xmath27 , bob measures his qubit in the basis @xmath28 .    if one allows for more complicated conditional state evolution @xcite , then more measurements are localizable . in particular , consider a _ verification _ measurement , i.e. , the measurement yields a @xmath3-th result with certainty , if the state prior to the classical interventions was given by @xmath29 , but without making any specific demand on the resulting state @xmath30 .",
    "it is possible to realize a verification measurements by means of a shared entangled ancilla and bell - type measurements by one of the parties @xcite .",
    "verification measurement of eq .",
    "( [ examp1 ] ) can illustrate this construction .",
    "in addition to the state to be tested , alice and bob share a bell state @xmath31 .",
    "they do not have to coordinate their moves .",
    "alice and bob perform tasks independently and convey their results to a common center , where a final decision is made .",
    "the procedure is based on the teleportation identity |_1|^-_23 = ( |^-_12    @xmath32 means the state @xmath33 rotated by @xmath34 around the @xmath35-axis , etc .",
    "the first step of this measurement corresponds to the first step of a teleportation of a state of the spin from @xmath36 ( bob s site ) to @xmath37 ( alice s site ) .",
    "bob and alice do not perform the full teleportation ( which requires a classical communication between them ) .",
    "instead , bob performs only the bell measurement at his site which leads to one of the branches of the superposition in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ ident ] ) .",
    "the second step of the verification measurement is taken by alice .",
    "instead of completing the teleportation protocol , she measures the spin of her particle in the @xmath35 direction . according to whether that spin is up or down",
    ", she measures the spin of her ancilla in the @xmath35 or @xmath38 direction , respectively .",
    "this completes the measurement and it only remains to combine the local outcomes to get the result of the nonlocal measurement @xcite .",
    "this method can be extended to arbitrary hilbert space dimensions .",
    "1 .   measurements in quantum field theory are discussed in @xcite .",

    "absence of the superluminal communication makes possible to evade the theorems on the impossibility of a bit commitment . in particular",

    "here we only note in passing that if @xmath48 is an operator that corresponds to the detection of an event in a spacetime region @xmath49 , since they are not thought to be implemented by physical operations confined to that spacetime area , the condition @xmath50=0 $ ] is not required @xcite .",
    "there is no elementary particle that is called  qubit \" .",
    "qubits are realized by particular degrees of freedom of more or less complicated systems . to decide how qubits transform ( e.g. , under lorentz transformations ) it may be necessary to consider again the entire system . in the following our qubit",
    "will be either a spin of a massive particle or a polarization of a photon .",
    "a quantum lorentz transformation connects the description of a quantum state @xmath51 in two reference frames that are connected by a lorentz transformation @xmath52 ( i.e. , their coordinate axes are rotated with respect to each other and the frames have a fixed relative velocity ) .",

    "the purpose of this section is to explain the elements of this quantum circuit",
    ".    from the mathematical point of view the single - particle states belong to some irreducible representation of the poincar group .",
    "an introductory discussion of these representations and their relations with states and quantum fields may be found , e.g. , in @xcite . within each particular irreducible representation",
    "there are six commuting operators .",
    "the eigenvalues of two of them are invariants that label the representation by defining the mass @xmath55 and the intrinsic spin @xmath56 .",
    "the basis states are labelled by three components of the momentum @xmath57 and the spin operator @xmath58 .",

    "spin and momentum are not entangled , and the spin entropy is zero .",
    "when that particle is described in bob s lorentz frame , moving with velocity @xmath64 at the angle @xmath65 with alice s @xmath35-axis , a detailed calculation shows that the the spin entropy is positive @xcite .",

    "hence the probability of error is @xmath84 .",
    "the relativistic effects in photons are essentially different from those for massive particles that were discussed above .",
    "this is because photons have only two linearly independent polarization states .",

    "it is known @xcite , that the dynamics of a subsystem my be not completely positive , there is a prior entanglement with another system and the dynamics is not factorizable . since in eq .",
    "( [ dope ] ) and in the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) we have seen that distinguishability _ can _ be improved , we conclude that these transformations are _ not completely positive_. the reason is that the lorentz transformation acts not only on the `` interesting '' discrete variables , but also on the primary momentum variables that we elected to ignore and to trace out , and its action on the interesting degrees of freedom depends on the `` hidden '' primary ones .",
    "of course , the complete state , with all the variables , transforms unitarily and distinguishability is preserved .",
    "this technicality has one important consequence . in quantum information theory quantum channels",
    "are described by completely positive maps that act on qubit states .",
    "qubits themselves are realized as discrete degrees of freedom of various particles .",
    "if relativistic motion is important , then not only does the vacuum behave as a noisy quantum channel , but the very representation of a channel by a cp map fails .",
    "in this section i consider only two - particle states . even in this simple setting",
    "there are several possible answers to the question what happens to the entanglement , depending on the details of the question .",
    "since the quantum lorentz transformation is given by a tensor product @xmath154 , the overall entanglement between the states is lorentz - invariant .",
    "let us assume that the states can be approximated by momentum eigenstates .",
    "then , the same conclusion applies to the spin - spin ( or polarization - polarization ) entanglement between the particles , and it is possible to write an appropriate entanglement measures that capture the effects of particle statistics and lorentz - invariance of the entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , it does not mean that this invariance will be observed in an experiment , or that the violation of bell - type inequalities that is observed in an experiment that is performed in alice s frame will be observed if the same equipment is placed in bob s frame .    while a field - theoretical analysis shows that violations of bell - type inequalities are generic , there are conditions that are imposed on the experimental procedures that are used to detect them . consider the chsh inequality .",
    "for any two spacelike separated regions and any pairs of of operators , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , there is a state @xmath1 such that the chsh inequality is violated , i.e. , @xmath157 . with additional technical assumptions",
    "the existence of a maximally violating state @xmath158 can be proved : ( a , b,_m)= [ violall ] , for any spacelike separated regions @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "it follows from convexity arguments that states that maximally violate bell inequalities are pure .",
    "what are then the operators that lead to the maximal violation ?",
    "it was shown @xcite that the operators @xmath161 and @xmath17 that give @xmath162 satisfy @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and likewise for @xmath17 .",
    "if we define @xmath165/2 $ ] , then these three operators have the same algebra as pauli spin matrices .    in principle",
    "the vacuum state may lead to the maximal violation of bell - type inequalities .",
    "their observability was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the operators @xcite a_i=22 ( , ) , where @xmath166 is the wigner spin operator and @xmath167 appear quite naturally as the candidates for the measurement description .",
    "the length of the auxiliary vector @xmath168 is ||= , so generically @xmath169 , and indeed , the degree of violation decreases with the velocity of the observer .",
    "nevertheless , it is always possible to compensate for a wigner rotation by an appropriate choice of the operators @xcite .",
    "realistic situations involve wave packets .",
    "for example , a general spin-@xmath170 two - particle state may be written as    particles with well defined momenta , @xmath171 sharply peaks at some values @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",
    "again , a boost to any lorentz frame @xmath174 will result in a unitary @xmath175 , acting on each particle separately , thus preserving the entanglement .",
    "nevertheless , since they can change entanglement between different degrees of freedom of a single particle , the spin - spin entanglement is frame - dependent as well .",
    "having investigated the reduced density matrix for @xmath176 and made explicit calculations for the case where @xmath171 is a gaussian , as in the sec .",
    "4.2 above , it is possible to show that if two particles are maximally entangled in a common ( approximate ) rest frame ( alice s frame ) , then the concurrence , as seen by a lorentz - boosted bob , decreases when @xmath177 . of course , the inverse transformation from bob to alice will increase the concurrence @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that that spin - spin entanglement is not a lorentz invariant quantity , exactly as spin entropy is not a lorentz scalar .",
    "relativistic properties of the polarization entanglement are even more interesting @xcite , since there is no frame where polarization and momentum are unentangled .",
    "because of the lack of space i am only going to mention the various fascinating areas of the interplay between quantum information theory and relativistic physics .",
    "quantum field theory provides us with new situations that should be investigated .",
    "for example , it is possible to ask all the usual questions about entanglement , distillability , etc and their invariance@xcite .",
    "so far we discussed only observers that move with constant velocity .",
    "an accelerated observer sees unruh radiation .",
    "it leads to a host of interesting effects if we consider a teleportation between a stationary and accelerated observer @xcite .",
    "dynamical entanglement  the one appearing in the scattering processes or between the decay products also have been investigated @xcite .",
    "going to more exotic settings , i just mention that black hole physics , cosmology , loop quantum gravity and string theory provide extremely interesting scenarios where the questions of information can and should be asked@xcite    99 a. peres and d. r. terno , _ rev .",
