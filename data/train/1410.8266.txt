    "study of temporal variability including signatures of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) is an important aspect of astrophysics of black holes .",
    "several models in the literature attempt to explain origin of low frequency qpos .",
    "they include perturbation inside a keplerian disk @xcite , global disk oscillation @xcite , oscillation of wrapped disk @xcite , accretion ejection instability at the inner radius of a keplerian disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite , envisages a bounded region surrounding compact objects which is called the transition layer ( tl ) and identifies low frequency qpos as that associated with the viscous magneto - acoustic resonance oscillation of the bounded tl .",
    "chakrabarti and his collaborators @xcite showed that the oscillations of centrifugal pressure supported accretion shocks @xcite could cause observed low frequency qpos . according to the two - component advective flow ( tcaf ) model @xcite",
    "the post - shock region itself is the compton cloud . because the shock is formed due to centrifugal force , where energy is dissipated and angular momentum is redistributed , post - shock region is also known as the centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ( cenbol ) of the black hole .",
    "this tcaf solution has been proven to be of stable configuration ( giri & chakrabarti , 2013 ) and monte - carlo simulations of spectral and timing properties through a time dependent radiative hydrodynamic code showed the formation of qpos very similar to what is observed @xcite . the compton cloud becomes smaller because of higher viscosity as well as higher cooling .",
    "higher viscosity causes the keplerian disk on the equatorial plane to move in .",
    "this causes the compton cloud to cool down .",
    "this picture is clear from the two component model of @xcite and the outburst source picture given in @xcite based on it . to our knowledge , except tcaf",
    ", no other model is found to be capable of explaining continuous and simultaneous variation of spectral properties and timing properties ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are mainly two reasons behind oscillation of shock wave in an accretion flow : i ) resonance oscillation : when cooling time scale of the flow is comparable to the infall time scale @xcite , this type of oscillation occurs .",
    "such cases can be identified by the fact that when accretion of the keplerian disk is steadily increased , qpos may occur in a range of the accretion rates , and the frequency should go up with accretion rate . not all the qpos may be of this type .",
    "some sources ( for example , 2010 gx 339 - 4 outburst ) , show signatures of sporadic qpos during rising soft - intermediate states ( where qpo frequencies of in @xmath36 hz were observed for around 26 days ; @xcite ) , although rise in the accretion rates . in these cases",
    "the shock strength has to change in order that the resonance condition holds good .",
    "ii ) non - steady solution : in this case , the flow has two saddle type sonic points , but rankine - hugoniot conditions which were used to study standing shocks in @xcite are not satisfied .",
    "examples of these oscillations are given in @xcite where no explicit cooling was used .",
    "such type of qpos are possible at all accretion rates , outside the regime of type ( i ) qpos mentioned above .",
    "qpo frequencies depend on viscosity ( higher viscosity will remove angular momentum , bring shocks closer to the black hole , and produce higher frequency qpos ) , but not explicitly on accretion rate . in any case , observed qpo frequency is inversely proportional to the infall time ( @xmath4 ) in the post - shock region .",
    "so , when low frequency ( e.g. , mhz to few hz ) qpos are observed , generally during very early phase of an outburst or very late phase of an outburst of transient black hole candidates ( bhcs ) , shocks are located very far away from black holes and size of the cenbol is large . as a result ,",
    "amount of cooling by photons from keplerian disk @xcite is high ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper - i ) and cenbol pressure drops , moving the shock closer towards black hole ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* paper - i ) until pressure ( including centrifugal ) is strong enough to balance the inward pull .",
    "lower shock location increases the qpo frequency .",
    "different bhcs show different oscillation frequencies during their evolution ( both in rising and declining ) phases .",
    "using propagating oscillatory shock ( pos ) model by chakrabarti and his collaborators @xcite one can satisfactorily explain origin and day - wise evolution of qpo frequencies during rising and declining phases of outbursting bhcs . during rising phase shock moves towards black holes increasing qpo frequencies monotonically with time and opposite scenario",
    "is observed during declining phase , mainly in hard and hard - intermediate spectral states of the outbursts ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite showed that observed qpo frequencies can be predicted from detailed spectral analysis using two component advective flow ( tcaf ) model as a local additive table model in xspec . @xcite and @xcite also showed physical reason behind spectral state transitions from spectral model fitted parameters of tcaf model for two different galactic bhcs h  1743 - 322 , and gx  339 - 4 during their outbursts .",
    "basically , the same shock location is obtained by fitting the spectra produces qpos through oscillations .",
    "so spectral properties are interlinked with timing properties as far as tcaf solution is concerned .    in this",
    "_ paper _ , our goal is to explain origin of observed qpo evolution from pure analytical point of view using compton cooling .",
    "biggest uncertainly being that of viscosity parameter , we would like to have an idea of how viscosity usually vary with distance in a known source .",
    "we consider a transient bhc h  1743 - 322 during its 2010 outburst .",
    "we hope that in future , this behavior could be used to better predict qpo evolutions .    in august 2010 ,",
    "h  1743 - 322 was found to be active in x - rays @xcite with a characteristics of temporal and spectral evolutions @xcite similar to those observed in other transient bhcs ( see for a review , * ? ? ?",
    "detailed source description is already in literature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the _ paper _ is organized in the following way : in the next section , we discuss governing equations of modified rankine - hugoniot ( r - h ) shock conditions in presence of compton cooling . in  3 , observed qpo evolution and what this tells us about viscosity variation in the disk as a function of radial distance .",
    "we also present phase space diagram of the flow in progressive days .",
    "finally , in  4 , we briefly discuss our results and make our concluding remarks .",
    "we assume the accreting flow to be thin , axisymmetric and rotating around vertical axis . to avoid integrating in a direction transverse to flow motion , we consider that the flow is in hydrostatic equilibrium in vertical direction as in @xcite . in tcaf , cenbol is basically the post - shock region of a low angular momentum , sub - keplerian flow .",
    "it is comparatively hotter , puffed up , and much like an ion supported torus @xcite . due to inverse compton cooling effect of intercepted low energy photons from a keplerian disk , energy of cenbol decreases and is radiated away .",
    "energy equation at the shock is modified by , @xmath5 where , @xmath6 is the energy loss due to comptonization .",
    "baryon number conservation equation at the shock is , @xmath7 since the gas is puffed up , r - h conditions @xcite have to be modified , so that only vertically integrated pressure and density parameters are important .",
    "this modification was first carried out in @xcite , where pressure balance condition was modified using vertically integrated values : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are pressure and density , integrated in the vertical direction @xcite . in our solution , we use the eq .",
    "( 8a ) of paper - i as an invariant quantity at the shock , which is given by : @xmath11 ^ 2}{2+(\\gamma-1)m_{+}^2}=             \\frac{[m_{-}(3\\gamma-1)+(\\frac{2}{m_{-}})]^2}{2+(\\gamma-1)m_{-}^2-\\zeta } , \\eqno{(2)}\\ ] ] where , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the mach number , radial velocity and adiabatic index of flow respectively , @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is adiabatic sound speed .",
    "we follow the same mathematical procedure and methodology as in paper - i , to find shock location for a given cooling rate . in the standard theory of thin",
    "accretion flows around black holes @xcite viscosity plays a major role .",
    "@xcite showed formation of keplerian disk for super - critical @xmath0 parameter @xcite .",
    "inflow angular momentum is transported outward by viscosity and allow it to fall into the black holes .",
    "as the shock moves closer , the angular momentum must be adjusted by viscosity so that the shock formation is theoretically allowed . for our viscosity calculation",

    "we keep hydrogen column density ( n@xmath36 ) frozen at 1.6@xmath37  10@xmath38  atoms  @xmath39 for absorption model _ wabs _ and assume a @xmath40% systematic error for all observations @xcite .",
    "in this _ paper _ , we study origin and evolution of qpos in outbursting bhc h  1743 - 322 , from a purely analytical point of view . in @xcite and @xcite , it was shown that matter from the companion is heated up due to compression and puffed up due to centrifugal barrier to form cenbol .",

    "1b . on first observed day of the outburst ( mjd = 55417.2 ) , location of the shock ( @xmath42 in schwarzschild radius @xmath43 ) was at @xmath44 and at the end of our observation ( mjd = 55424.1 )",

    "we calculate the velocity of movement of the shock to be @xmath51 , which roughly matches with the final velocity of shock wave calculated from the pos model fit of the qpo frequency evolution ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fig . 2a",
    ", we show variation of observed qpo frequencies with time .",
    "if viscosity parameter @xmath0 were constant throughout the outburst then the variations of theoretically calculated qpo frequencies would be different .",
    "dotted curve drawn for a viscosity parameter ( @xmath0 ) @xmath52 shows that qpo frequency increases at almost constant rate . the dashed curve of fig .",
    "2a is for the effect of non - linear variation of the viscosity , which is shown in fig .",
    "as the day progresses , viscosity adjusts in such a way that the angular momentum can produce a shock at a suitable place satisfying r - h conditions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , with their extensive numerical simulations showed that angular momentum distribution depends on viscosity parameter . in our solution , at the beginning of the outburst during the hard state , from mjd=55417.2 to mjd=55420.2 ( debnath et al",
    "2013 ; mdc14 ) , @xmath0 varies from @xmath53-@xmath54 to @xmath55-@xmath54 . during the hard - intermediate state , from mjd=55421.3 to mjd=55424.1 @xcite , @xmath0 varies rapidly from @xmath56-@xmath57 to @xmath58-@xmath59 .",
    "our @xmath0 calculation is for sub - keplerian component only . in fig .",
    "2c , we show the variation of @xmath0 with shock location .",
    "dashed curve shows variation from our analytical solution , whereas dotted curve is a fitted polynomial , which gives a general trend and could be used in other systems .",
    "we see that @xmath60 @xmath61 , where , @xmath62(=@xmath63 , with asymptotic standard error @xmath64 ) and @xmath65(=@xmath66 , with asymptotic standard error @xmath67 ) are constants for this bhc .",
    "it is to be noted that this viscosity parameter is computed for the sub - keplerian flow component only .",
    "qpos in black hole candidates are very stable features .",
    "they are seen day after day , though the frequency may be drifted slowly as the object goes from hard to soft state in the rising phase .",
    "this is generally observed in most of the outbursting bhcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "propagatory oscillating shock solution can explain such frequency drifts very well @xcite .",
    "these phenomenological model is found to be justified when we actually compute shock drifts from radiated energy loss from a self - consistent transonic solution .",
    "we find that in order to have rankine - hugoniot conditions satisfied on each day , viscosity parameter must be evolving too .",
    "if the outer boundary condition is kept fixed , increase in viscosity parameter causes shock to drift outward @xcite , but if the inner boundary condition is kept fixed , the shock moves inward @xcite .",
    "we find support of the latter phenomenon in an outbursting source where matter supply is changing and viscosity enhancement steadily brought the shock closer to the black hole .",
    "cooling is found to rise day by day and so is @xmath0 .",
    "such a movement of the shock increases qpo frequency as is observed .",
    "our result establishes consistency in theoretical understanding of the observed data : as cooling increases , observed qpo frequency increases due to drifting of the shock towards black hole in a way that the cooling time scale roughly matches with the infall time scale .",
    "this process brings the object towards the softer states as is observed .",
    "shock locations were found to be located at the right place ( i.e. , r - h conditions are satisfied ) , only if viscosity is not strictly constant , but gradually rises from @xmath1 to @xmath2 from the first day to @xmath3 seventh day .",
    "it is to be noted that there are alternative models @xcite where the corona is supposed to oscillate at its eigen frequency and the viscosity required in this case is around @xmath68 .",
    "this appears to be too high as compared to what we find in the present paper .",
    "the discrepancy could be due to the fact the latter models rely on oscillations of a keplerian disk with high angular momentum and they require higher viscosity to reduce it drastically . in our case , on the contrary , the oscillating cenbol is highly sub - keplerian to begin with .",
    "therefore , a little viscosity is enough the transport requisite angular momentum .",
    "this range of @xmath0 we require is in the same ball park as obtained from numerical simulations @xcite of magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
