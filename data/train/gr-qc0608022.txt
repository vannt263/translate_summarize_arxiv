    "a wide range of massive objects from the compact relativistic stars , as black holes and neutron stars , up to modern cosmological models , including early universe and its evolution  @xcite where the solutions of einstein equations are applicable and important is currently known .",
    "but the logic of scientific development and practical experience requires an introduction into the consideration of principally new objects , like cosmic strings , gravitomagnetic monopoles , quasiclosed worlds etc .",
    "the extension of objects under research leads to the additional analysis and extension of well known existing solutions of fundamental field equations",
    ". therefore reconsideration of old and finding new exact exterior solutions of einstein field equations describing space - time around these objects is one of the interesting and important branches of general relativity and theoretical physics .",
    "there exist a lot of interesting problems , especially in quantum gravity , because it is still not clear how to build quantum gravity ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) and in this level of our understanding it is very useful to investigate objects which are on the boundary between classical and quantum gravity .",
    "of special importance also are external gravitational fields of isolated stars , as today is recognized they are at the core of most intriguing astrophysical phenomena . in spite of the fact that many exact solutions of einstein equations can be found in classical monographs as  @xcite",
    "it is still interesting to study new possible solutions of this fundamental equation .    in our present work",
    "we concentrate our efforts in investigation and analysis of some exact solutions of einstein equations  @xcite , namely , on the exterior axisymmetric fields in the vacuum , arising around rotating gravitational objects . in our consideration",
    "we look for some mathematical features and structure of einstein equations , which could determine their physically acceptable solutions .",
    "in fact , our motivation is , that the papapetrou class of axially - symmetric solutions  @xcite@xmath0@xcite of vacuum einstein equations does not contain physically interesting one , because in the classical newtonian limit there is no term being proportional to @xmath1 , what means that it describes rotation field for the bounded systems with zero mass  @xcite . however it should be noted , that one of the solutions of einstein equations with the similar asymptotic behavior has been considered and interpreted as gravitational field of massless quadrupole  @xcite . from geometrical point of view , the gravitational source is characterized by a topological closure of internal three dimensional space with zero integral contribution according to its zero mass .    in the papapetrou case",
    "the solutions are given in the class of pure harmonic functions @xmath2 and our assumption is to investigate this solution in the more extended functional space of functions @xmath2 .",
    "here we follow to the logic of investigation , brilliantly reflected in  @xcite .",
    "as we will show in the section  [ ext ] , small difference , introduced by us into the approach described in  @xcite , gives us a possibility to obtain solution of einstein equations for more general class , which includes papapetrou one as particular case .    throughout",
    ", we use a space - like signature @xmath3 and a system of units in which @xmath4 .",
    "greek indices are taken to run from 0 to 3 and latin indices from 1 to 3 ; partial derivatives are denoted with a comma .",
    "we consider a stationary axially symmetric object in cylindrical coordinates @xmath5 and assume that there is no any gravitating matter outside of it . for the rotating fields in gr , the most general form of the metric of space - time of axially",
    "symmetric objects can be written as weyl - lewis - papapetrou one , presented in the form  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are unknown metric functions may depend on the cylindrical coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the external gravitational field is described by the symmetric ricci tensor @xmath11 which obeys to the exterior einstein vacuum equations @xmath12 .",
    "the nonvanishing @xmath13 and @xmath14 components of einstein equations can be written as  @xcite @xmath15 following to the approach presented in  @xcite one can select the function @xmath16 satisfying to equation @xmath17 as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a constant .",
    "mathematical properties of function @xmath2 will be defined below .",
    "it is easy to see , that after substituting @xmath16 in ( 4 ) and using simple relations @xmath20 one can write @xmath21 integration of the equation  ( [ zeta ] ) gives an expression for @xmath2 : @xmath22    therefore we introduced an arbitrary function @xmath23 .",
    "introduction of this function is very important , because it could generate different kind of solutions for set of differential equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "hereafter we have essential difference with compare to  @xcite and our aim is to solve einstein equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) in terms of more wide class of functions @xmath2 , which include harmonic functions as a particular case .    in the case",
    "@xmath24 equation ( [ pois ] ) becomes laplace one , which is similar to the expression given in  @xcite .",
    "however in the general case when @xmath25 , we have poisson like equation ( [ pois ] ) for function @xmath2 instead of laplace one . using the relations ( [ 5 ] ) for the function @xmath16 and condition ( [ 4 ] ) one can rewrite field equation ( [ 3 ] ) as @xmath26    it follows from the equations ( [ pois ] ) and ( [ 3_mod ] ) the general solution for the metric function @xmath27 takes the following form @xmath28    after introducing new variable @xmath29 and derivative @xmath30 @xmath31 one can rewrite the derivatives of the metric function @xmath27 in the following way @xmath32,\\quad f_{,zz}=f''(\\zeta_{,zz}-\\eta ) ^2 + f'(\\zeta_{,zzz}-\\eta_{,z})\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the equations ( [ pois ] ) and ( [ deriv ] ) one can get @xmath33\\ , \\\\",

    ". here parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 have the same meaning as in the papapetrou solutions . as a particular case , in the limit @xmath24 , the solution ( 16 )",
    "reduces to the papapetrou one  @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "as a rule , one of the main difficulties , after finding an exact solution of einstein equations is a physical interpretation of it . in the case of the papapetrou solutions in the newtonian limit that is at large arguments @xmath41 , the asymptotics looks like @xmath42\\ ] ] and does not contain a term being proportional to @xmath1 . from comparison of expression (",
    "[ 17 ] ) with the metric given in  @xcite @xmath43dt^2- \\left[4\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\frac{s^jx^k}{r^3}+ o(r^{-3})\\right]dt\\cdot dx^i- \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\nonumber\\\\    - \\left[(1+\\frac{2m}{r})\\delta_{jk}+o(r^{-1})\\right]dx^jdx^k\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can conclude that for any given harmonic function @xmath2 , the metric ( [ 16 ] ) with @xmath24 does not contain solution with nonzero mass of the rotating axially symmetric source  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath44 is the mass of the source and the three dimensional spatial vector @xmath45 is the total angular momentum .",
    "we expect that in general case when @xmath46 it would be possible to construct a solution , which gives flat asymptotics at infinity for massive sources . as an example , one of the possible solutions could be obtained in the following way .",
    "assume that the function @xmath47 could be taken as a product of two functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 . then from equation  ( [ pois ] ) one can get @xmath50    taking solution for the function @xmath51 in the form @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , we have for the function @xmath54 the following equation @xmath55 here function @xmath56 and @xmath57 is constant . the last equation is the bessel one  @xcite and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is zero rank bessel function .",
    "finally @xmath60(e^z - e^{-z})\\ , \\ ] ] and according to  ( [ tilzetd ] ) it gives an expression for the function @xmath29 @xmath61 which takes the simple form @xmath62 at the plane @xmath63 .",
    "for the large arguments @xmath64 , zero rank bessel function has the following asymptotic behavior @xmath65 and consequently @xmath66 where we put , for the simplification @xmath67 . using asymptotic properties of hyperbolic functions one could write @xmath68    substituting obtained asymptotic expressions ( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) in solution  ( [ 16 ] ) , we can write the asymptotics of function @xmath69 , at the plane @xmath63 when @xmath64 , in the following form @xmath70 + o(\\rho^{-2})\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can see from the asymptotics ( [ asympt ] ) that in contrast to the papapetrou one ( [ 17 ] ) there is a term being proportional to @xmath71 and at the same time we have asymptotically flat solution at @xmath63 plane .",
    "the general solution for function @xmath72 can be derived by the simple integration of right hand side of the poisson like equation ( [ pois ] ) : @xmath73 thus in the general case the solution ( [ 16 ] ) for function @xmath27 contains function @xmath74 which satisfy to the integral ( [ 28 ] ) and as result function @xmath36 generates new solutions for the function @xmath75 . at the end",
    "we would like to underline that for this class of functions @xmath2 , satisfying to the poisson like equation ( [ pois ] ) , this is most general solution .    using nonvanishing components of einstein vacuum equations @xmath76 and following to the book  @xcite we",
    "can easily obtain the connection of function @xmath77 with functions @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath75 : @xmath80 and therefore the metric , presented by expression @xmath81 is defined completely .",
    "one can see form equation  ( [ 16 ] ) that the general solution is invariant under the transformation @xmath82 in the functional space of function @xmath2 , where function @xmath83 satisfies to the condition @xmath84 this is gauge condition directly connected with the source of gravitational field defined by the metric function @xmath36 . from our point of view",
    "this statement is analogous to the lorentz gauge condition for the maxwell equations in electrodynamics .",
    "it is obviously , that any solution of einstein equations becomes important if it has any physical application and identified with the source of gravitational field . here",
    "we demonstrate , that the obtained extension of papapetrou solution contains , for example , solution for the line gravitomagnetic monopole and can be useful in the interpretation of the connection of the metric source with the gravitomagnetic monopole momentum @xmath85 .",
    "if we take @xmath74 in the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 are some constants and @xmath90 , then as it follows from the expression  ( [ zeta_m ] ) , so defined function @xmath74 satisfies to the equation @xmath91 for an arbitrary function @xmath36 . choosing in our solution @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 , for the simplicity",
    ", we can obtain @xmath95 the function  ( [ f_rho ] ) coincides with the metric function @xmath96 from the paper  @xcite and therefore presents the space time around this source , reproducing cylindrical analogue of nut space , named for newman , tamburino and unti  @xcite .",
    "from this simple example one can see using @xmath97 that the consideration of the line gravitomagnetic monopole metric in the weyl - lewis -papapetrou form leads to @xmath98 from where one can conclude , that gravitomagnetic monopole momentum @xmath99 in accordance with definition of parameter @xmath39 .",
    "further investigation of the effect of gravitational field of a line gravitomagnetic monopole on test electromagnetic fields has been considered in our accompanying paper  @xcite .",
    "we conclude , that obtained solution  ( [ 16 ] ) is an extension of the well known papapetrou class of solutions , which can be applied to the physical systems , presenting rotating bounded nonzero masses .",
    "we have constructed the solution for the particular function @xmath36 , which in some sense , demonstrates the existence of @xmath71 term in asymptotics .",
    "in addition using properties of poisson like equation for @xmath2 function , we have found the general solution ( [ 28 ] ) for any given function @xmath100 , which generates various metric functions @xmath69 .",
    "the connection of above obtained solution with metric of a line gravitomagnetic monopole was considered as a particular case .",
    "this is preliminary result and the physical interpretation of the obtained solution is outside the framework of this paper .",
    "more detailed investigation and application to gravitational sources is the scope of our future research . in this respect as the next step",
    "we want to investigate the regularity conditions at the axis @xmath101 in dependence from the choice of function @xmath100 .",
