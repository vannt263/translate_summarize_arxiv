    "note though that this does not mean that the gap is exponentially small for arbitrary random 3-sat . for @xmath0 to be",
    "small we also have to keep the number of solutions constant .",
    "for instance , below the transition point @xmath110 the number of solutions for random 3-sat grows exponentially with @xmath13 ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) and therefore our formula for gap ( [ eq : delta ] ) can not be used to predict the scaling for @xmath111 .    in the next section",

    "the second ensemble of 3-sat instances , called binomial 3-sat , is generated in such a way that the degeneracies @xmath107 are explicitly known , enabling analytical calculation of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "to illustrate the theory we numerically calculated @xmath0 for single - solution random 3-sat instances with @xmath113 and compared this with the theoretical prediction for @xmath0 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : delta ] ) is exponential in @xmath13 one can hardly see any difference between the theory and numerics in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps_id ] ( _ e.g. _ for @xmath114 the two agree to @xmath115 decimal places ! ) .",
    "note that for random 3-sat we do not know explicit form of degeneracies @xmath21 so we had to calculate @xmath85 and @xmath86 numerically .",
    "for instance , for @xmath116 we have @xmath117 and @xmath118 , resulting in @xmath119 , see also data in fig .  [",
    "fig : binomial ] . to remedy this drawback of having to numerically calculate @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    "we have constructed another set of 3-sat instances , shortly binomial 3-sat , for which @xmath21 are given by the binomial distribution and therefore we can explicitly calculate @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    the prescription to construct binomial 3-sat is the following .",
    "assume that @xmath13 is divisible by @xmath115 and denote @xmath120 .",
    "we split @xmath13 qubits into @xmath121 triples and for each triple we add @xmath122 different clauses involving this three qubits ( out of @xmath123 possible ) . in total",

    "the degeneracies of such binomial 3-sat are @xmath126 .",
    "for binomial degeneracies one can express @xmath85 and @xmath86 in term of a generalized hypergeometric function , @xmath127 while this expressions are exact they are not very illuminating .",
    "we are particularly interested in large @xmath13 behavior .",
    "using asymptotic expansion  @xcite one gets @xmath128 and @xmath129 , resulting in @xmath130 , where @xmath131 denotes asymptotically equal . to demonstrate our explicit result ( [ eq : delta ] ) in the case of binomial",
    "3-sat ( [ eq : gamma_f ] ) we again performed numerical calculation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binomial ] .",
    "this time we rather show @xmath88 as the plot for @xmath0 would look very similar to the one for single - solution random 3-sat in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps_id ] . in the lower frame",
    "we can see that the accuracy of theoretical @xmath88 ( [ eq : delta ] ) is indeed exponential .",
    "note that binomial 3-sat is rather artificial and easy to solve classically , we use it just to demonstrate our theory .",
    "the same expression for the minimal gap as here for the binomial 3-sat has been obtained also for the adiabatic grover s algorithm in  @xcite where a similar symmetry as here has been exploited .",
    "our result shows that asymptotically the gap scales as @xmath132 for an arbitrary random 3-sat ( with constant @xmath45 ) .",
    "this means that the running time grows as @xmath133 , the same as for grover s algorithm . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is proved that the running time of any grover s algorithm of the form @xmath134 , for an arbitrary @xmath135 , must be larger than @xmath133 .",
    "farhi _ et .",
    "_ have pointed out  @xcite that the proof can be straightforwardly extended to hamiltonians of the form @xmath136 ( _ i.e. _ of the form we use ) to show that : demanding that after time @xmath137 we reach the ground state of @xmath16 from any of the basis states @xmath138 ( _ i.e. _ averaging over a complete basis is used in the proof ) , the running time @xmath137 must be larger than @xmath133 . what does this tell us about the running time for a single specific choice of @xmath139 that we use ?",
    "provided one is able to show that there exists a basis , a member of which is our @xmath2 , for which the running time is the same for all members @xmath138 of that basis ( or at least scales the same ) , would mean that the running time must necessarily be larger than @xmath133 also for specific @xmath139 , _ i.e. _ the gap must be smaller than @xmath140 . without showing this nothing",
    "can be concluded about the running time for a particular @xmath14 , not even about the average running time .",
    "but fortunately , such a basis can be found .",
    "it consists of eigenvectors of @xmath141 operator . in @xmath142-eigenbasis",
    "that we use , all such basis states are sums of all computational states with the signs in front of them depending on the eigenvalue of @xmath141 , @xmath143 , with @xmath144 . for instance , for our @xmath2 ( [ eq : h0 ] ) we have @xmath145 .",
    "one can now quickly see that the same symmetry arguments used in the derivation of eq .",
    "[ eq : sim ] for state @xmath2 can be used also for other @xmath138 s of the above form . in particular , the eigenvalue problem can be reduced to the very same matrix @xmath31 ( [ eq : sim ] ) for each of @xmath138 s .",
    "this then shows that if one uses for @xmath138 s the eigenstates of @xmath141 operator the running time is the same for all . using the above",
    "mentioned proof one can then conclude that the running time must be larger than @xmath133 also for our choice of @xmath139 which is in accordance with our explicit result ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that one can obtain the asymptotic dependence of @xmath146 already by projecting the hamiltonian @xmath31 to a @xmath42-dimensional subspace spanned by state @xmath2 and the solution state @xmath147 .",
    "the reason for the grover - like scaling of @xmath0 for large @xmath13 is that the lowest two levels become effectively decoupled from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "this `` decoupling '' arises because the couplings @xmath148 ( for fixed @xmath58 ) go toward zero by increasing @xmath13 .",
    "note though that our result for @xmath0 ( [ eq : delta ] ) is nonperturbative , _",
    "i.e. _ one can not obtain function @xmath88 by perturbative corrections to the asymptotic result , _",
    "e.g. _ by perturbatively including higher levels .",
    "is this asymptotic square - root behavior of quantum adiabatic algorithm for 3-sat general , _",
    "i.e. _ independent of our choice of @xmath149 or of the interpolating path ? here",
    "we will discuss only the effect of different choices of @xmath149 although the choice of optimal path is also important , for an example when the choice of the path matters see  @xcite .",
    "important is to distinguish between the average - case and the worst - case performance .",
    "for the average - case performance numerics clearly shows that our choice of @xmath149 is less than optimal .",
    "for instance , taking for @xmath149 a sum of terms @xmath150 , one for each qubit , the average gap is usually much larger than @xmath140 .",
    "the situation is on the other hand different if one considers the worst - case performance .",
    "numerical calculations of @xmath0 for @xmath151 , see refs .",
    "@xcite , indicate that the gap for single - solution random 3-sat instances with small @xmath97 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath152 ) shows dependence similar to the square - root asymptotic formula derived in the present paper . in ref .",
    "@xcite where exactly the same normalization of the hamiltonian as here is used the asymptotic dependence of @xmath0 is exactly @xmath132 , _ i.  e. _ without any fitting prefactor .",
    "therefore , there are numerical indications that the worst - case performance could be the same @xmath140 also for other choices of @xmath149 while on the other hand the average - case performance might be significantly better   that is a sum of @xmath153qubit terms the gap is even independent of @xmath13 ! ] .",
    "a distinctive feature of single - solution 3-sat instances with small @xmath97 that seems to play a role in this square - root behaviour of the gap is that the number of statements ( states ) that violate only one clause is exponentially large ( though still exponentially smaller than @xmath25 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath16 has a single ground state and at the same time exponentially degenerate first excited state just above it .",
    "adiabatic algorithm therefore has to `` find '' the right ground state among exponentially many that are `` almost '' ground states .",
    "p.  shor also presented an informal mathematical argument why one can expects the worst - case performance for npc problems to be the same as that for searching in an unstructured database  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have provided an analytical expression for the minimal gap of a particular implementation of the quantum adiabatic algorithm for 3-sat .",
    "the derivation shows that such adiabatic algorithm is asymptotically equivalent to searching in an unstructured database .",
    "numerical calculations hint that the same asymptotic worst - case performance might be obtained also for other choices of initial hamiltonian .",
