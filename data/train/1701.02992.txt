    "in this paper we study the homogenization problem for a bingham flow in a porous medium with solid obstacles of different size .",
    "the aim of our paper is twofold : we first define the unfolding operators for periodic homogenization in a domain which presents periodically distributed perforations of two different size and we give corresponding compactness results .",
    "then we illustrate these results with an application to the homogenization of a bingham flow in a porous medium with solid obstacles of different size .    in order to define the appropriate unfolding operators and to get the compactness results , we follow the ideas introduced by d. cioranescu , a. damlamian and g. griso in @xcite and @xcite for the case of functions with one scale of periodicity and developed later by a. damlamian , n. meunier , j. van schaftingen in @xcite and @xcite for the case of functions with more than one periodicity scales .",
    "nevertheless , our result is different from the ones presented in the previous cited papers , due to the presence of the perforations at the two different scales .",
    "the case , different from the one presented here , corresponding to the unfolding operators for a doubly periodic domain presenting perforations at the very small scale only , was recently addressed by bunoiu , and donato in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , our domain contains small perforations of size @xmath0 periodically distributed with period @xmath0 and very small perforations of size @xmath1 periodically distributed with periodicity @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath2 are real positive parameters smaller than one with @xmath2 tending to zero when @xmath0 tends to zero .",
    "such a geometry modelizes , for example , a porous medium in which the perforations correspond to solid impervious obstacles .",
    "in the fluid part of this porous medium we consider the stationary flow of the bingham fluid , under the action of external forces .",
    "the bingham fluid is an incompressible fluid which has a non linear constitutive law ; so it is a non - newtonian fluid .",
    "this fluid moves like a rigid body when a certain function of the stress tensor is below a given threshold . beyond this threshold",
    "the fluid flows , obeying a non linear constitutive law .",
    "as example of such fluids we can mention some paints , the mud which can be used for the oil extraction and the volcanic lava .",
    "bingham flow in other contexts is studied by bunoiu , and kesavan in@xcite . for a presentation of the different types of non - newtonian fluids we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the mathematical model of the bingham flow in a bounded domain was introduced in @xcite by g. duvaut and j. l. lions .",
    "the existence of the velocity and of the pressure for this model was proved in the case of a bi - dimensional and of a three - dimensional domain .    the homogenization problem in a classical porous medium , with obstacles of size @xmath0 and @xmath0-periodically distributed , was first studied in @xcite by j. l. lions and e. sanchez - palencia .",
    "the authors did the asymptotic study of the problem by using a multiscale method , involving a macroscopic  variable @xmath3 and a microscopic  variable @xmath4 , associated to the relative dimension of the pores .",
    "the study is based on a multiscale ansatz , which allows to obtain to the limit a non linear darcy law .",
    "there is no convergence result proved .",
    "the rigorous justification for the convergence of the homogenization process of the results presented in @xcite is given by a. bourgeat and a. mikelic in @xcite . in order to do it , the authors used monotonicity methods coupled with the two - scale convergence method introduced by g. nguetseng in @xcite and further developed by g. allaire in a series of papers , as for example @xcite .",
    "the limit problem announced in @xcite was obtained , by letting the small parameter @xmath0 tend to zero in the initial problem .",
    "the unfolding method for periodic homogenization , introduced by d. cioranescu , a. damlamian and g. griso in @xcite was used by r. bunoiu , g. cardone , c. perugia in @xcite in order to obtain the limit problem .",
    "this method presents the advange of transforming in an easy manner the initial problem , stated in a domain dependent on @xmath0 , in a problem stated in a domain independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the passage to the limit when @xmath0 tends to zero is then simple thanks to the compactness results , and this for the non linear terms too .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we define the double perforated domain , the unfolding operators adapted to it and then we give a compactness result . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we describe the problem of the bingham flow and we give the _ a priori _ estimates for the velocity and the pressure of the flow . following the ideas in r. bunoiu , j. saint jean paulin @xcite",
    ", we construct the extension of the pressure to the whole domain , namely in the perforations too . in section [ section4 ] we state the main result of the paper , which consists in getting the limit problem .",
    "it is obtained in two steps : we first apply the unfolding operators for periodic homogenization defined in section [ section2 ] to the variational formulation of the problem which describes the bingham flow in our porous medium",
    ". then we pass to the limit when the small parameter @xmath0 tends to zero . in section [ section5 ]",
    "we give the interpretation of the limit problem in term of a non linear darcy law and we compare it with the classical linear darcy law .",
    "let @xmath5 be a bounded open domain in @xmath6 with lipschitz continuous boundary @xmath7 @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "we consider two fixed reference cells @xmath10   0,y_{1}^{0}\\right [ \\times ... \\times\\left ]   0,y_{n}^{0}\\right [   $ ] and @xmath11   0,z_{1}^{0}\\right [   \\times ... \\times\\left ]   0,z_{n}^{0}\\right [   $ ] and two closed subsets @xmath12 and @xmath13 with non - empty interior and lipschitz continuous boundaries , contained in @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",

    "this last hypothesis implies some restrictions for the geometry of @xmath12 .",

    "we proceed in two steps : first we use the general theory of the unfolding homogenization in order to make the transformation from the domain @xmath5 to the domain @xmath53 . in order to do this , we use the unfolding operator introduced in @xcite for the scale @xmath0 . next we define a second unfolding operator , for the scale @xmath2 , which allows us to transform oscillating functions defined on @xmath53 into functions defined on @xmath52 . in order to do this , we will follow in addition the ideas of a. damlamain n. meunier , j. van schaftingen in @xcite and @xcite .",
