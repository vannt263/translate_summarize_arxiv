    "during the past five decades , semiconductor device miniaturization has brought modern device technology to the nanometer scale where quantum phenomena of charge and spin transport start to dominate the device physics.@xcite for tiny devices , the atomic nature of the materials are playing an increasingly prominent role@xcite and charge transport in these systems driven by external fields is intrinsically a nonequilibrium problem . as a result",
    "the operation of nano - scale electronics crucially depends on the close coupling of nonequilibrium quantum transport phenomena with the atomic structure of the device material .",
    "such a situation poses serious challenges to theoretical understanding and computational modeling of nanoelectronic device physics .",
    "more recently , atomistic methods have been combined with the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism to meet the challenges of quantitative analysis of nanoelectronics .",
    "the atomistic methods are used to determine the material properties as well as the device hamiltonian while negf is used to predict the nonequilibrium density matrix and transport properties .",
    "when combined self - consistently , such techniques can predict not only qualitative but also quantitative properties of quantum transport in nano - devices . along this line ,",
    "the state - of - the - art formalism is to carry out self - consistent density functional theory ( dft ) atomistic calculation within the negf framework.@xcite so far , parameter - free negf - dft methods have been widely applied to capture quantum transport physics from the atomistic point of view.@xcite    however , in order to apply first principles approach to investigate _ semiconductor _ nanoelectronics , some very serious issues have to be resolved .",
    "first , realistic semiconductor devices ( e.g. transistors ) have large number of atoms and doped with small concentrations of impurities , while typical dft methods can only comfortably deal with low hundreds of atoms .",
    "second , dft with the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite underestimate band gaps of semiconductors .",
    "one could not predict transport results if band gaps and dispersions were not accurate : this is especially serious for semiconductors appearing in transistors since their gaps are not very large to begin with .",
    "advanced methods such as gw@xcite and hybrid functional@xcite can yield accurate band gaps for many systems , but require very large computation for semiconductor devices having hundreds to thousands of atoms .    for pure semiconductors , a recently proposed modified becke - johnson ( mbj )",
    "semilocal exchange was shown to give good band gaps for many semiconductors with a computational cost similar to that of lda.@xcite mbj is not a fundamental solution to the issue of electron correlation , but it is practically useful for calculating band structures thus helpful for analyzing quantum transport properties . by implementing the mbj functional into a newer generation of negf - dft technique which is based on linear muffin tin orbital ( lmto ) method with the atomic sphere approximation ( asa),@xcite transport in si nano - transistors with localized doping and large number of atoms was recently analyzed.@xcite clearly , a very important next step is to investigate iii - v semiconductors .",
    "the iii - v compound semiconductors are the most important materials for optoelectronic device applications and are also very important for the complementary metal - oxide - semiconductors ( cmos ) technology .",
    "major efforts are devoted by the microelectronics industry to integrate iii - v semiconductors into si cmos.@xcite iii - v semiconductors have been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically,@xcite with particular attention paid to their band topologies since band parameters are critical for understanding quantum transport .",
    "electronic structures of several direct gap iii - v compounds have also been calculated using the mbj functional as implemented in the planewave dft codes .",
    "@xcite it is the purpose of this work to employ the dft - mbj approach within the lmto - asa scheme , to accurately calculate the band parameters of _ all _ the zinc - blend iii - v semiconductors .",
    "our calculated band gaps at high - symmetry points ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) are quantitatively compared with the corresponding experimental data ; our calculated effective hole / electron masses at @xmath0 point are also well consistent to the experimental values .",
    "details of the asa schemes and the mbj potentials will also be presented .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the calculation method is briefly discussed .",
    "section iii presents the results and section iv is a short summary .",
    "our calculation is based on the dft - mbj self - consistent approach where dft is within the lmto scheme and the atomic sphere approximation,@xcite as implemented in the nanodsim software package.@xcite for technical details of the nanodsim algorithm we refer interested readers to the original literature.@xcite a @xmath3 @xmath4-mesh were used to sample the brillouin zone of the primitive cell .",
    "the lattice constant for the semiconductors were adopted from ref .   and listed in table  [ tab1 ] . in order to carry out lmto dft calculations for semiconductors ,",
    "a good asa scheme is very helpful . in our asa",
    ", vacancy spheres were placed at appropriate locations as done in ref .   for space",
    "filling , and the same sphere radius are used for all the vacancy spheres and atomic spheres .",
    "electrons in the full d - orbital of ga , in , as , and sb are included as valence electrons .",
    "after the lmto dft self - consistent calculation is completed , band structures are calculated by the the muffin - tin orbital ( mto ) approach .",
    "the effective hole mass @xmath5 and effective electron mass @xmath6 were then obtained by fitting the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum to a parabola , respectively .",
    "spin - orbit coupling was not considered in this work .",
    "some details of the mbj semilocal exchange potential is worth mentioning .",
    "the mbj potential has the following form,@xcite @xmath7 where subscript @xmath8 is spin index , @xmath9 is the electron density , @xmath10 is the kinetic energy density , and @xmath11 is the becke - roussel potential.@xcite the relative weight of the two terms is given by a parameter @xmath12 which depends linearly on the square root of @xmath13 . for all solids investigated by the mbj potential",
    "so far,@xcite it appears that @xmath14 increases monotonically with @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath12-value can be determined by the protocol discussed in refs .  .",
    "in our calculations , because the lmto - asa is a site oriented technique , it allows the @xmath12-value to be ",
    "local \" , namely one can use a @xmath12-value for the atom and another @xmath12-value for the vacancy sphere . in particular , for a given compound , the same @xmath12-value is used for the real atoms ( e.g. ga and as ) , and another @xmath12-value is used for the vacancy spheres . recently",
    ", this mbj scheme was applied in ref .   to determine very accurate band gaps for the al@xmath15ga@xmath16as compounds and band offsets for the gaas / al@xmath15ga@xmath16as heterojunctions for the entire range of the concentration @xmath17 .",
    "here we use the same scheme for all the iii - v compounds and the optimized @xmath12-values are found and listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "even though one may expect more accurate band parameters by using different optimized @xmath12-values for all the different atomic spheres , the scheme we use is a good compromise between being simple and also reasonably accurate .",
