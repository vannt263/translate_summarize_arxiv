    "the lcls baseline includes a planar undulator system , which produces intense linearly polarized light in the wavelength range between @xmath3 nm and @xmath4 nm @xcite .",
    "several schemes using helical undulators have been proposed for polarization control at the lcls setup @xcite .",
    "the option presented in @xcite , exploits the microbunching of the planar undulator . after the baseline undulator",
    ", the electron beam is transported along a @xmath5 m long straight line by fodo focusing system and subsequently passed through a helical radiator .",
    "if the microbunch structure of the bunch can be preserved , intense coherent radiation is emitted in the helical radiator .",
    "the driving idea of this proposal is that the background linearly - polarized radiation from the baseline undulator is suppressed by spatial filtering .",
    "this operation consists in letting radiation and electron beam through horizontal and vertical slits upstream of the helical radiator , where the radiation spot size is about ten times larger than the electron bunch transverse size .",
    "the effect of betatron motion on the preservation of micro bunching in such scheme should be accounting for .",
    "in fact , the finite angular divergence of the electron beam , linked with the betatron function , yields a spread of the longitudinal velocity leading to microbunching suppression .",
    "in @xcite we estimated this factor , and concluded that the betatron motion should not constitute a serious problem in proposed scheme .",
    "in this paper we present a comprehensive study of the effect of betatron motion on the microbunch preservation .",
    "our paper is based on the use results of @xcite , where it was showed that in the limit for a small length of a fodo cell with respect to the betatron function value , the longitudinal velocity of an electron , averaged over a fodo cell , is constant through the focusing system . based on this non - trivial statement , one can work out an analytical expression for the debunching of an electron beam moving in a fodo lattice , strictly valid in the asymptote for a short fodo cell . further on ,",
    "numerical studies can be used to demonstrate that the validity of such analytical expression goes beyond the above - mentioned asymptote , and can be used in much more a general context .",
    "the present work is organized as follows . in the following section [ sec : due ] we review the main result in @xcite , and we report the expression for the average longitudinal velocity of an electron , which depends on the courant - snyder invariant of motion . based on this result , the analytical expression for the debunching is calculated . in section [ sec : tre ] , the analytical asymptote is cross - checked with numerical calculations , and its validity is extended . a comparison with results obtained with the code genesis @xcite",
    "is presented .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] , we come to conclusions .",
    "the starting point for our analysis is a consideration on the longitudinal velocity of an electron in a fodo lattice . as has been shown in @xcite , when the length of the fodo cell @xmath6 is much shorter than the betatron function , the longitudinal velocity of the electron , averaged over one fodo cell length , is constant . from a mathematical viewpoint , this result",
    "may be obtained with simple analytical calculations from eq .",
    "( 6 ) and eq . ( 7 ) of reference @xcite .",
    "we will begin to consider a 2d motion on the @xmath7 plane .",
    "the longitudinal velocity of a certain electron can be written as @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the electron speed , and @xmath10 is the angle formed at each point of the electron trajectory with the longitudinal axis .",
    "when , as is the case for ultrarelativistic electrons moving along the @xmath11 axis , @xmath12 , one can expand the trigonometric function and obtain @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) and eq . ( 7 ) of reference @xcite .",
    "when the length of fodo cell , @xmath6 , is much shorter then betatron function , the magnitude of the twiss parameter @xmath15 approaches unity , and one can re - write these two equations approximatively as :      here @xmath17 is the particle courant - snyder invariant , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the betatron function and the betatron phase respectively .",

    "this result looks at first glance surprising .",
    "in fact , a glance of a typical electron trajectory shows , fig .",
    "[ betatr ] shows an overall oscillatory trajectory , and one would expect that the longitudinal velocity at @xmath23 , where the electron trajectory forms an angle with the @xmath11 axis , should be smaller than , for example , that at @xmath24 m , where the trajectory is almost parallel to the @xmath11 axis .",
    "the physical explanation is that the longitudinal velocity is decreased at the position for at @xmath25 m , by the presence of sharp oscillations on the scale of the fodo cell , which , as demonstrated above , lead to a constant average longitudinal velocity .",
    "we will now make use of eq .",

    "the relation between @xmath35 and the bunching factor @xmath36 , which can be often found in literature is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the total number of particles within a wavelength @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the phase of each particle .",

    "the phase difference of an electron with courant - snyder invariant @xmath17 with respect to one moving on - axis , after a given distance @xmath44 can thus be written as @xmath45 .",
    "since the rms value for @xmath17 is the geometrical emittance @xmath46 one obtains , parametrically , @xmath47 is of order @xmath48 , which is the second and last relevant parameter of our problem .",

    "finally , we note that all considerations have been made for a 2d motion on the @xmath63 plane .",

    "one needs to account the divergence @xmath64 , giving an extra contribution to the phase @xmath47 formally identical as that for the horizontal direction , once the horizontal beta function is substituted with the vertical one .",

    "in order to study the influence of the betatron beating on the microbunch suppression and to have an idea about the accuracy of our analytical asymptotic results , we simulated the evolution of the bunching numerically .",
