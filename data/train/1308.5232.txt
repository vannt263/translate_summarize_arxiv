    "one of the basic premises of this work is that turbulence is roughly in equipartition with magnetic fields in starbursts ( c.f .",

    "the fluctuation dynamo is thought to be a ubiquitous phenomenon .",
    "it relies on the freezing of magnetic fields in most astrophysical plasmas . in plasmas with random motions",
    ", the field lines get tangled , and the magnetic field strength increases .",
    "the characteristic residence time of turbulence is an eddy - crossing time , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the outer scale and @xmath15 is the turbulent speed .",
    "@xmath14 is the scale at which turbulence is driven ; turbulent energy cascades to smaller scales .",
    "the key result of the energy cascade is a spectrum of velocity fluctuations reaching from @xmath14 down to an inner scale @xmath16 where the energy dissipates .",
    "typically , the velocity fluctuation spectrum is thought to be some kind of power law @xcite .    as the velocity spectrum develops , the chaotic motions of the plasma deforms the frozen - in magnetic fields , resulting in magnetic fluctuations .",
    "a magnetic fluctuation spectrum grows in parallel to the velocity fluctuation spectrum , possibly from small scales to large scales . on some timescale of order",
    "the eddy - crossing time , the magnetic fields approach equipartition with turbulence and alter the dynamics of the fluid motions . at this point , the fluctuation dynamo enters a nonlinear regime ; it ultimately `` saturates '' and the magnetic field growth stops @xcite . the fluctuation dynamo does not by itself generate regular fields , as observed in spiral galaxies",
    " these must arise from some other magnetic dynamo @xcite .",
    "at least this is the basic picture , but there are many disagreements on the details .",
    "the nature of the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations remains unclear .",
    "for hydrodynamical turbulence , most power is at large scales ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : turbspectrum ] ) .",
    "but whether the magnetic fluctuations are in equipartition with these velocity fluctuations at each scale is a matter of debate . according to @xcite , in a flucatuation dynamo , the magnetic fluctuation spectrum only traces the velocity fluctuation spectrum at scales below the resistive scale ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the magnetic reynolds number ; @xcite ) , which is tiny in astrophysical systems . as a result",

    "the saturated state of the fluctuation dynamo may also depend on the kind of turbulent forcing .",
    "@xcite found that solenoidal forcing led to much higher @xmath19 than compressive forcing .",
    "supernova explosions push the ism in a compressive manner , yet they can amplify solenoidal motions dramatically in cold and warm gas @xcite . a `` shear dynamo '' operating in sheared , turbulent flows leads to not only turbulent magnetic field growth , but a field stronger along one direction than others ( @xcite ; c.f . , @xcite ) .    for the rest of the paper ,",

    "the first counterargument of @xcite is that the column of ionized gas inferred from the free - free absorption cutoff of supernova remnants is too small under such pressures , unless ionized gas only fills a small fraction .",

    "it would be interesting to see where the demarcation between hot wind and cold gas dominated starburst occurs by conducting vlbi observations of starbursts with properties between those of m82 and arp 220 .",
    "one possible target is arp 299 ; there have been several vlbi observations but no snr expansion speeds reported yet @xcite .",
    "many drivers of turbulence in star - forming galaxies , tapping different energy sources , have been proposed .",
    "these include gravitationally - powered disk - scale instabilities @xcite , galactic accretion @xcite , the expansion of superbubbles and snrs @xcite , h ii region expansion @xcite , protostellar winds and jets @xcite , and radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "a combination of any of these may operate in different classes of galaxy and in different ism phases .",
    "for example , the primary power source for milky way turbulence is probably superbubbles and supernovae , but with additional contributions from the other sources depending on the scale @xcite .",
    "the hot superwind of starbursts is transparent to radiation and is not bound to the starburst .",
    "the only possible drivers of turbulence are those with mechanical forcing : the expansion of superbubbles and snrs , in particular .",
    "supernovae and stellar winds are the power source for these ; their mechanical luminosity is well known ( see appendix  [ sec : cc85properties ] ) .",
    "the situation is less clear in molecular clouds and in cold starbursts .",
    "supernovae go off in these regions , and might drive turbulence there as well @xcite .",
    "supernova remnants may be highly radiative in these regions , with @xmath96 of their mechanical energy going into turbulent forcing @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , radiation is potentially a powerful source of turbulence in the extreme infrared radiation pressure and optical depths in these environments ( table  [ table : pressures ] ) ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "the toomre @xmath218 is observed to be @xmath219 in arp 220 ( see section  [ sec : ustarburst ] ; @xcite ) , a condition which promotes disk instabilities @xcite .",
    "the debate over the source of turbulence in nearby starbursts is related to the similar debate over turbulence driving in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "high redshift disks are observed to host clumps and large velocity dispersions . although @xcite argued that a correlation between turbulence and star - formation rate proves star formation powers turbulence , other authors note that toomre @xmath218 is near 1 in the clumps and propose that disk instabilities are the source of turbulence @xcite .    in any case , though , stellar mechanical luminosity sets a lower bound on the turbulent energy injection .",
    "i therefore focus my discussion on turbulence powered by snrs and other mechanical sources .",
    "the addition of other turbulent drivers would lead to faster turbulent velocity dispersions , and stronger turbulent magnetic fields .      throughout my discussion , i have largely ignored the diffuse warm phases , the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) and the warm ionized medium ( wim ) , as well as the cool neutral medium ( cnm ) .",
    "hi gas makes up the great majority of the milky way s gas mass , and the wim and wnm fill roughly half of its volume ( see figure  [ fig : ismsketches ] ) .",
    "however , the molecular fraction of gas increases with increasing @xmath45 and @xmath7 ; for starbursts , the majority of the gas mass is molecular @xcite .",
    "this still leaves a minority of the gas mass in neutral phases in weaker starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein for the gccmz ; @xcite and @xcite for m82 ) . yet",
    "its density should tend to be near the mean molecular gas density .",
    "the neutral gas pressure support is either thermal or neutral .",
    "if the neutral gas were very underdense , it would need to have much higher turbulent speeds than the molecular gas ( @xmath220 ) to resist collapse . yet",
    "such speeds would eject the neutral gas . on the other hand , the sound speed of warm gas ,",
    "@xmath221 is only a few times smaller than the turbulent speed of the molecular gas .",
    "thus , warm gas can not remain in equilibrium if it is in very overdense , because the thermal pressure alone would exceed the surrounding turbulent pressure .",
    "cool neutral gas might be overdense if it had a small turbulent velocity , but as i show in section  [ sec : coldturbulence ] , the expected turbulent energy density depends weakly on the gas density .",
    "a wim with a substantial filling fraction of starbursts is unlikely to exist in starburst regions @xcite .",
    "briefly , the high densities of starburst gas leads to rapid recombination .",
    "therefore , the ionizing photons produced by the starburst can only ionize a few percent of the gas mass .",
    "in addition , not all ionizing photons may be available , if some are destroyed by dust absorption or escape through the hot wind .",
    "a low density wim is inconsistent with the pressure constraints .",
    "instead , the only wim that can survive is in h ii regions that fill a small fraction of the volume and have densities comparable to the mean . and",
    "indeed , such h ii regions are known to exist through radio recombination line studies @xcite : the h ii regions most likely _ are _ the wim in starbursts @xcite .    in short , the wim , wnm , and cnm , to the extent",
    "they exist in starbursts , have mean densities comparable to the molecular gas . since the calculation of turbulent speeds and magnetic fields does not depend on temperature , these quantities should be similar to those of the molecular gas as derived in section  [ sec : coldturbulence ] .",
    "the one difference is the mach number , which is much smaller in the wim and wnm than in molecular gas because of the higher temperatures .",
    "smaller mach numbers lead to smaller density contrasts in the turbulence @xcite .",
    "it therefore appears that starburst isms are , in some sense , simpler than the galactic ism .",
    "the famous three phases ( cold , warm , and hot ) of the milky way and other warm galaxies @xcite are reduced to two in hot starbursts ( cold and hot ) and finally only one in cold starbursts , as depicted in figure  [ fig : ismsketches ] .",
    "what evidence do we even have that there is turbulence and magnetic fields in the hot wind ?",
    "although snrs no doubt push into the wind , such motions do not necessarily fill the whole medium . nor",
    "is it obvious that a fluctuation dynamo operates in the hot wind .",
    "although we have little direct evidence regarding the magnetic fields and turbulence in superwinds , there is circumstantial evidence from the synchrotron emission .",
    "vlbi observations resolve out most of a starburst s radio emission , indicating it is truly diffuse and not confined to small clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the gccmz , one of the few starburst regions we can resolve in low frequency radio , 74 mhz observations reveal synchrotron emission shining from beyond h ii regions , implying the crs are not confined to these regions @xcite .",
    "a merlin image of m82 also shows synchrotron emission at 400 mhz outside of a large h ii region @xcite .",
    "i propose the simplest explanation for this diffuse radio emission is that cr @xmath12 actually do permeate the volume of the starburst and are radiating synchrotron throughout it . in hot starbursts , this means that the crs spend most of their time in the volume - filling phase , the superwind .",
    "the diffuse synchrotron emission traces magnetic fields in the superwind .",
    "in addition , the gamma - ray luminosities of m82 and ngc 253 imply that cr protons are being advected out by the starburst wind . if they instead remained in the starburst , they would eventually be destroyed by pionic losses as they passed through dense gas clouds . in this `` proton calorimeter",
    "'' limit ( c.f . ,",
    "* ) , the energy that went into accelerating cr protons would then be converted into pions , about a third of it ending up as gamma - rays .",
    "the actual gamma - ray luminosities of m82 and ngc 253 are only @xmath222 of the calorimetric limit , implying that crs are escaping @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the hard gev to tev gamma - ray spectra of these starbursts imply that crs escape through an energy - independent process , which is contrary to our normal understanding of cr diffusion @xcite .",
    "the gccmz also displays underluminous but hard gamma - ray emission and even synchrotron radio emission for its star - formation rate , which suggests rapid energy - independent cr escape @xcite .",
    "advection by the starburst wind naturally accounts for these observations .",
    "but whereas the hot wind is consistently expelled out of the starburst , only @xmath223 of the cold and warm gas is ejected per advection time ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "otherwise , the gas mass would be depleted within a myr , quenching star formation .",
    "unless the crs `` know '' which warm and cold clouds are going to be expelled , advective escape implies they are primarily in the hot superwind .",
    "the supernova observations i describe in [ sec : snrevolution ] support cr injection directly into the superwind too .",
    "the rapidly expanding supernova remnants of m82 can only exist if they are in a low density phase , like the superwind .",
    "yet they are clearly glowing in synchrotron , implying cr @xmath12 acceleration .",
    "additional support comes from 400 mhz merlin observations of supernova remnants in m82 .",
    "these also emit synchrotron radiation , but a significant fraction display no free - free absorption @xcite , again implying they are not in h ii regions .",
    "finally , radio haloes are observed around starbursts , indicating cr @xmath12 and magnetic fields are present in their winds @xcite .",
    "a similar kiloparsec - scale radio halo is observed around the gccmz @xcite .",
    "since there is warm and cold gas mixed with the wind , this by itself does not prove the cr @xmath12 and magnetic fields are in the hot phase per se .",
    "strong adiabatic losses may also cool the wind and the cr @xmath12 on kiloparsec scales from the starburst ( cc85 ) , so the physical conditions may not be equivalent to the hot ism inside the starburst .",
    "but the radio haloes are consistent with magnetic fields and cr @xmath12 being present in the hot wind itself .",
    "the existence of turbulence ( or at least volume - filling random motions ) , magnetic fields , and crs throughout hot superwinds is therefore plausible .",
    "clearly this can not be the whole picture : the ( presumably pionic ) gamma - ray emission from the gccmz , ngc 253 , and m82 implies that crs must at some point enter denser gas .",
    "in fact , models of the nonthermal emission of m82 and ngc 253 are consistent with crs experiencing the average density of gas in starbursts over their lifetimes ( e.g. , @xcite ; higher than average densities are possible as shown by @xcite ) , suggesting that they traverse all of the phases of the ism . in gccmz",
    "molecular clouds @xcite . ] the situation would then be analogous to the milky way , where crs diffuse through the low density , warm / hot galactic halo outside of the gas disk most of the time , but experience most of their gas interactions in the neutral and molecular galactic disk .",
    "as in the milky way , most of the synchrotron emission of starbursts comes from underdense hot plasma , but occasionally the crs penetrate into molecular clouds and/or h ii regions and experience energy losses from pion production , bremsstrahlung , and ionization .",
    "this could happen if there are a sufficiently large number of molecular clouds , so that most magnetic field lines ( and , thus , most cr paths ) traverse a molecular cloud , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "i note that this scenario , which motivates my calculation of the turbulence and magnetic fields in superwinds , bears some similarities to that presented by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the thermal , magnetic , cr , and turbulent energy densities in the hot ism are in equipartition in actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "they argued this meant that the timescales regulating each are equal , and derived magnetic field strengths by relating the cr diffusive escape time to the radiative cooling time .",
    "my hypothesis is weaker , simply that turbulence and magnetic fields are in equipartition .",
    "as it turns out , the four energy densities in the wind end up being roughly equal in weaker starbursts , but this is not explicitly required in this paper and the defining timescale is the flow crossing time ( see section  [ sec : equipartition ] ) . in denser starbursts ,",
    "equipartition between crs and magnetic fields fails entirely .",
    "my discussion is guided by the cc85 theory of starburst winds , which gives approximate values for the wind temperature , central density , and pressure .",
    "many processes can shape the wind and alter the cc85 values , such as nonthermal pressure from magnetic fields and crs , but one deserves special mentioning , the low collisionality of hot dilute plasmas .",
    "the cc85 theory assumes that the wind is a hydrodynamic fluid , which has a locally defined pressure and temperature . yet ,",
    "when the plasma has a small enough density , it becomes more collisionless , and its electrons and ions may have different temperatures ( @xmath225 for electrons and @xmath226 for ions ) , or even no temperature at all . although @xcite briefly investigated the possibility that m82 s wind plasma is collisionless , the issue bears greater examination when considering the very different conditions in wind fluids for starburst regions ranging from the gccmz to ulirgs",
    ".    collisions are most effective at transferring energy when the two particles have the same mass .",
    "while the effective cross sections for collisions between particles with the same charge are the same , lighter particles have a higher microscopic speed at a given energy , so their collision rate is faster .",
    "thus , the electron - electron collision frequency is highest , so electrons are the most collisional particles with the best - defined temperature .",
    "the electron - electron collision frequency is @xmath227 .",
    "the typical value of the coulomb logarithm ( @xmath228 ) in a superwind plasma is @xmath229 @xcite . in a cc85 superwind ,",
    "the electron - electron collision frequency is : @xmath230.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the time for the wind to escape the starburst region is typically a few hundred kyr . in all starburst superwinds ,",
    "the electrons are collisional and have established a maxwellian pressure and temperature distribution .",
    "since ions are heavier , they are slower and collide more rarely , with @xmath231 ( for hydrogen ions ) : @xmath232.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the weakest starbursts , like the gccmz , the ion - ion collision approaches the advection time .",
    "thus , the ions in these regions will only approximately establish a maxwellian distribution .",
    "finally , electrons and ions are poorly coupled in wind plasmas because they have such different masses .",
    "the light electrons are easily deflected by the much heavier ions with an electron - ion collision frequency that is just @xmath233 .",
    "yet very little energy transfer occurs in these deflections , only about @xmath234 of the particle kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "the timescale for energy transfer between the ions and electrons is set by the ion - electron collison frequency , which is much slower even than @xmath235 : @xmath236 or @xmath237.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] over a broad range of starburst conditions  including the gccmz , ngc 253 , and m82  the ion - electron collision time is comparable to or longer than the advection time .",
    "the electrons and ions do not necessarily have the same temperature in these starbursts .",
    "collisions only matter for the dynamics on the largest scales , those bigger than the mean free path .",
    "the mean free path is given by @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the thermal speed of the particle .",
    "the mean free paths are similar for electrons and hydrogen ions .",
    "for the specific case of electrons , with a thermal speed @xmath240 , the mean free path is : @xmath241.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the gccmz s scale height is actually not much bigger than the particle mean - free path ",
    "collisionless dynamics play a role in all scales in that region . in m82 and ngc 253 , the superwind plasma is collisionless on scales smaller than a parsec .",
    "therefore , unlike molecular clouds or the warm ionized medium of the milky way , a starburst superwind is _ not _ a standard mhd fluid characterized by a single pressure and temperature .",
    "instead , it is governed by kinetic processes , with plasma waves and magnetic fields shaping the particle distributions on parsec and smaller scales .",
    "hydrodynamical models might leave out important physics , and quantities like the central temperature in the superwind are potentially inaccurate .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , i assume that the cc85 temperature and density ( equations  [ eqn : nc ] and  [ eqn : superwindtc ] ) are correct , at least well enough to estimate the properties of turbulence in the superwind , but a kinetic treatment would be very useful .    finally , what might be the signs of collisionless plasma ?",
    "first , the electron and ion temperatures can be different .",
    "fortunately , the different populations emit hard x - rays through distinct mechanisms .",
    "x - ray line emission comes from ions , while bremsstrahlung continuum is mostly emitted by the easily - deflected electrons . @xcite actually found that the diffuse hard continuum and iron line emission of m82 appeared to be tracing plasma of different properties .",
    "non - equilibrium between electrons and ions may account for this .",
    "second , as kinetic effects involving magnetic fields regulate the plasma , the magnetic field might be expected to introduce a preferred direction and _ anisotropy _ to the wind plasma .      given the low collisionality of wind plasma , can turbulence exist at all in the superwind ? in these conditions , the braginskii viscosity is very high , preventing hydrodynamical turbulence from appearing even if collisions are effective .",
    "the viscosity is dominated by ions moving along the magnetic field lines .",
    "this characteristic braginskii viscosity is given by @xmath242 which is typically @xmath243 for the superwind phase .",
    "the reynolds number of a flow in the superwind is then @xmath244 : @xmath245.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for standard hydrodynamical flows , turbulence appears when @xmath246 , implying starburst superwinds are laminar flows : while random motions may be present , the energy in them does not cascade down to small scales and dissipate as in true turbulence ( see similar considerations for the galactic coronal phase in * ? ? ?",
    "motions driven on yet smaller scales will have smaller velocities , and still smaller reynolds numbers .",
    "the problem with this argument is that collisionless processes can reduce the thermal ion mean free path and , with it , the viscosity .",
    "first , as discussed in   [ sec : collisonlesswinds ] , starburst regions themselves can be smaller than the collisional mean free path , which means that collisionless processes must set the actual ion mean free path . at most the effective kinematic viscosity is @xmath247 , so that the effective reynolds number is @xmath248 @xcite . the reynolds number of the wind is therefore unlikely to be less than @xmath249 .",
    "while this lower bound is still not large enough to guarantee hydrodynamical turbulence , this is a conservative estimate that assumes that collisionless processes can deflect ions only on length - scales comparable to the starburst size itself .",
    "a very similar situation occurs in galaxy clusters , which are filled with hot ( @xmath10 ) and rarefied gas , just like starburst winds . even though the formal reynolds number is @xmath250 , turbulence appears to be present .",
    "but the effective reynolds number in galaxy clusters is thought to be raised by collisionless processes such as plasma instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar processes may operate in starburst winds .",
    "turbulence dissipates more slowly on large scales than on small scales .",
    "the final energy density of the turbulence , and its strength at each scale in the turbulent cascade , therefore depends on the scale most of the energy is injected . in the milky way , this outer scale @xmath14 of the turbulence seems to depend on the location and ism phase , with values ranging from a few parsecs for ionized gas in the galactic spiral arms @xcite to about a hundred parsecs @xcite .",

    "if crs are frozen into the flow , turbulent mixing squeezes and stretches them too .",
    "the resulting strong fluctuations in the density of crs are purely random and not directly related to the locations of cr sources . on top of that , adiabatic expansion and compression of the crs enhances density gradients , as @xmath533 for relativistic particles .",
    "furthermore , turbulent mixing is generally intermittent on large scales , so that even if the underlying fluid were homogeneous , there would be fluctuations in the density of crs simply because the mixing can not even out the cr abundance perfectly @xcite .",
    "by contrast , standard diffusion reduces inhomogeneities , simply because there are more crs in a high density fluctuation to flow out than crs outside the fluctuation to flow in .",
    "the essential difference is that standard diffusion works to even out the _ density _ of crs , the number of crs per volume , whereas turbulent mixing works to even out the _ abundance _ of crs , the number of crs per mass ( c.f .",
    "the former can be thought of as a `` eulerian '' process , where the crs follow the volume .",
    "this is reflected by the eulerian methods used to treat diffusive propagation in models of galactic cr populations like galprop ( as described in * ? ? ?",
    "but turbulent mixing is a `` lagrangian '' process , where the crs follow the mass , suggesting a possible need for lagrangian methods when modeling starburst cr populations .",
    "an example of these methods are provided by mhd simulations of cr populations in galaxy clusters , where lagrangian cr transport is included ( often as the only form of cr transport ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath11 turbulence in the molecular medium has especially extreme density contrasts and extreme intermittency .",
    "current cr models assume that crs experience essentially steady losses in a uniform medium . but",
    "actual losses in a supersonic turbulent medium may be highly irregular .",
    "suppose crs are injected into such a medium at random locations .",
    "at any given time , the median gas density in the volume is @xmath534 to @xmath193 , but most of the mass is in clumps with density @xmath535 .",
    "thus , most crs could be injected into underdense regions , where they are presumably frozen into the flow . in these regions , losses are much slower than supposed by one - zone models .",
    "yet the flow rearranges itself on an eddy crossing time , @xmath536 , and most of the fluid containing the crs ends up in high density clumps . as the flow is squeezed into these clumps , the radiative losses become orders of magnitude stronger  up to a factor @xmath537 faster . at some point ,",
    "the radiative losses become faster than the advection times , and the crs are destroyed .",
    "thus , cr losses could occur in short bursts .",
    "although proton calorimetry implies the total gamma - ray luminosity does not depend on the proton cooling time , adiabatic compression of the crs converts mechanical energy into cr kinetic energy . when the crs are destroyed , that energy is mostly radiated away as gamma rays and neutrinos .",
    "turbulent mixing in supersonic turbulence can therefore decouple the power injected in crs from the power radiated as gamma rays .",
    "the intermittent destruction of crs and the implications for proton calorimetry need to be studied .      _ the cr diffusion constant around 30 doradus _  by comparing the resolved synchrotron and inverse compton emission of the super star cluster 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud , @xcite derived the cr diffusion constant and its energy dependence at gev energies in that region . the star - formation rate , @xmath538 , and size of the region the crs diffused through , @xmath539 , correspond to a star - formation surface density of @xmath540 , of the same order as in the gccmz .",
    "the measured cr diffusion constant is @xmath541 for relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "they conclude that the smallness of the diffusion constant is due to the high level of turbulence surrounding 30 doradus . at 1 gev ,",
    "the measured value is indeed comparable to the expected diffusion constant in the gccmz for a kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence .",
    "the steep energy dependence is , however , incompatible with the standard kolmogorov cascade . but according to @xcite , diffusion constants with @xmath542 arise when crs amplify waves from a previously existing kolmogorov spectrum as they self - confine .",
    "this process decreases @xmath543 .    yet",
    "the 100 pc surrounding 30 doradus may not be typical of starburst regions as a whole .",
    "there is only one super star cluster , whereas starburst regions contain many ( dozens of similar mass in m82 , for example ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , most of the star formation responsible for accelerating the crs occurs in r136 , with a diameter of a few pc , at the center of 30 doradus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the estimates of turbulence i derived above do not apply to the crs 100 pc away .",
    "for example , perhaps the crs are amplifying relatively weak turbulence in these distant regions to produce a small but steeply increasing diffusion constant .",
    "in contrast , star formation occurs on 100 pc scales throughout starbursts .",
    "observations of the gccmz , m82 , and ngc 253 exclude such steep energy dependencies within their starbursts , suggesting different physics .    _",
    "the tev emission of the gccmz and ngc 253 _  if the tev emission from the gccmz region is in fact powered by star formation , it indicates that cr diffusion is quite slow at tev energies @xcite .",
    "the spectrum observed by hess remains relatively hard , with a power law index of @xmath544 , until the highest observed energies of 10 tev @xcite .",
    "this implies energy - independent escape for crs with energies of up to 100 tev , or @xmath545    likewise , the hard gev - tev gamma - ray spectra of m82 and ngc 253 set stringent constraints on the rate of energy - dependent diffusion in these starbursts . according to @xcite , the lack of a spectral break in the gamma - ray spectrum of ngc 253 as observed with _",

    "we can compare this number with the predicted cascade diffusion constants @xmath547 listed in table  [ table : dpredictions ] .",
    "i find that the 30 tev diffusion constants are @xmath548 for the kolomogorov spectrum and @xmath549 for the kraichnan spectrum .",
    "while there is mild tension between the @xmath547 and the observed tev spectrum for the kolmogorov case , the kraichnan case is in line with observations .",
    "it is interesting that above 100 tev , the predicted @xmath547 for @xmath550 finally exceeds the limits set by hess , and a break in the proton spectrum should appear .",
    "unfortunately , at such high energies ( corresponding to @xmath551 gamma rays ) , ngc 253 becomes opaque as photons are destroyed by the @xmath552 absorption process @xcite .",
    "the gccmz , however , is transparent at these energies @xcite , and observable up to a few hundred tev @xcite .",
    "_ does the turbulence cascade in hot winds ? _  as noted in section  [ sec : linner ] , the estimates of @xmath547 in hot winds only apply if the turbulence can cascade to small scales .",
    "many authors have argued that the turbulence is halted at large scales in the hot medium of the milky way ( and by extension , in hot starbursts ) .",
    "a common objection is that the small reynolds number prevents any true cascade of magnetic energy to small scales @xcite .",
    "but , as i have argued , the collisionless nature of the wind implies the hydrodynamical reynolds number is not necessarily the relevant quantity ( section  [ sec : reynolds ] ) .",

    "the alfvenic speed is actually faster than the bulk speed of the wind in the core of the starburst ( @xmath555 ) , and is approximately equal to the asymptotic wind speed ( @xmath556 ) .",

    "these massive stars are also the power sources of the radiation used as star - formation indicators ( such as the bolometric luminosity , ultraviolet light , radio continuum , and radio recombination lines ) , so for star - formation rates derived from these tracers , the derived @xmath57 and @xmath668 of a starburst should not depend on imf , as long as it consistent throughout ( c.f .",

    "elaborations on this model have been given to include cooling @xcite , but the basic arguments should remain the same . after adjusting for geometry",

    "this is for an ideal gas with @xmath684 .",

    "the central number density of electrons , @xmath689 , is @xmath690 for @xmath691 and @xmath692 .",
    "the total particle density is @xmath693 : @xmath694    in the cc85 model , the central temperature of the superwind is given by the ratio of the energy and mass injection rates , which should be the same for all starbursts : @xmath695 i assume @xmath696 , appropriate for a completely ionized plasma , since the superwind is extremely hot .",
    "the associated sound speed is also universal in the cc85 model : @xmath697    finally , the central thermal pressure in the cc85 model is @xmath698 : @xmath699",
    "the galactic ridge shines in seemingly - diffuse hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) emission , and is especially bright in the gccmz @xcite . while a diffuse x - ray hot plasma",
    "was considered a possible source , the required to keep the plasma hot enough is implausibly high @xcite . a deep chandra image presented in @xcite largely settled the matter by demonstrating that much of the x - ray emission , especially at higher energies ( @xmath700 ) actually comes from discrete sources . but do these observations rule out a superwind from the cmz ( c.f .",
    "if the basic theory of cc85 is correct , and the temperature of the superwind is @xmath701 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : superwindtc ] ) , the free - free emission per unit volume in 2 - 10 kev x - rays is @xmath702 the surface density of star - formation in the gccmz is @xmath703 , and with a radius of @xmath539 , the typical sightline has length @xmath704 .",
    "that means that , if the superwind exists with a cc85-like density , the 2  10 kev x - ray intensity observed at earth from its free - free emission should be @xmath705 . this is just @xmath706 of the total 2  10 kev emission from the region @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite calculate that about half of the total emission is resolved at @xmath707 , increasing to @xmath708 at @xmath700 .",
    "note that the temperature of the superwind is 3.2 kev , so if the remaining unresolved emission is from the superwind we expect it to fall off at higher energies .",
    "the observations of @xcite therefore are consistent with the existence of a cc85 superwind , if the unresolved emission is partly free - free emission from the superwind : we would not expect the superwind to be as bright as the galactic x - ray ridge .",
    "the weak constraints on the superwind go back to the energetics issue .",

    "although the huge pressures in dense starbursts likely prevent hot winds from filling their volumes , @xcite went a step further and argued that the existence of the correlation between hard x - ray emission and star - formation rate ( @xmath709 ; @xcite ) actually rules out hot superwinds in starbursts with gas surface densities @xmath710 ( taking a temperature of @xmath701 ) , comparable to m82 .",
    "however , they assumed that the thermal pressure of the wind was @xmath151 ; as i showed in section  [ sec : ustarburst ] , that estimate gives problematically high pressures for dense starbursts .",
    "using equation  [ eqn : hardxrayemissivity ] instead , i calculate a 2  10 kev luminosity of @xmath711 from free - free emission of both nuclei of arp 220 , or @xmath712 .",
    "since arp 220 actually is x - ray faint compared to the x - ray ",
    "sfr correlation @xcite , and since x - ray binaries should contribute an additional @xmath713 @xcite , this is problematic .",
    "on the other hand , arp 220 s nuclei are compton thick , reducing the x - ray emission by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "i conclude there is some tension between the x - ray emission of arp 220 and the prediction for a cc85 , but not enough to actually rule out the superwind observationally . for m82 , where diffuse hard x - ray emission is observed directly ,",
    "there is no problem with the x - ray emission .",
    "i predict its superwind s diffuse 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity is @xmath714 , only @xmath715 and just one tenth of the amount of diffuse , unresolved x - ray emission observed from m82 s starburst @xcite .",
    "( the observed continuum may be brighter because ( 1 ) the wind s transonic turbulence makes it clumpy , and/or ( 2 ) the electron temperature is greater than @xmath716 because the ion - electron equilibrium time is greater than the advection time ; i argued that both are plausible previously in the paper . )",
    "the x - ray - sfr correlation _ does _ become constraining for extreme starbursts that are very big , like those in some submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) . whereas the free - free emission from the wind grows as @xmath717 ,",
    "the bolometric emission only grows as @xmath718 .",
    "thus , free - free emission becomes more dominant for starbursts with high @xmath7 and large radius : @xmath719 .",
    "smgs have typical radii of about two kiloparsecs @xcite as opposed to the @xmath539 scales of compact ulirgs observed at @xmath204 , and smg surface densities can reach those of arp 220 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , those without an agn lie on the x - ray - sfr correlation , demonstrating that they do not have a cc85-like superwind @xcite .",
    "finally , the winds in such galaxies would emit so much free - free radiation that they cool radiatively before escaping , stalling the wind and invalidating the cc85 theory @xcite .",
    "to summarize , the x - ray emission observed from starbursts is perfectly consistent with a superwind existing in m82-like starbursts . in compact ulirgs",
    "observed at @xmath204 , the x - ray - sfr correlation is not a conclusive disproof of the superwind phase , although the superwind would have to be a major contributor to the hard x - ray luminosity .",
    "extended ulirgs as at @xmath34 are indeed too x - ray dim to host a hot superwind ."
