    "since the dawn of lattice field theory @xcite , the doubling problem of fermions has been one of the notorious obstacles to qcd simulations . the famous no - go theorem of nielsen and ninomiya @xcite most clearly reveals the fate of lattice fermions .",
    "it states that lattice fermion actions with chiral symmetry , locality and other common features must produce degrees of freedom in multiples of two in a continuum limit .",
    "in contrast , phenomenologically there exist only three quarks with masses below the underlying scale of qcd . by now several fermion constructions to bypass the no - go theorem have been developed , although all of them have their individual shortcomings .",
    "for example , the explicit chiral symmetry breaking with the wilson fermion approach @xcite results in an additive mass renormalization , which in turn requires a fine - tuning of the mass parameter for qcd simulations .",
    "domain - wall fermion @xcite and overlap fermion @xcite do not possess exact locality , leading to rather expensive simulation algorithms .",
    "these approaches attempt to realize single fermionic degrees of freedom by breaking the requisite conditions for the no - go theorem .    on the other hand ,",
    "there is another direction to approach numerical simulations .",
    "according to @xcite , hypercubic symmetry and reflection positivity of actions result in @xmath1 species of fermions where @xmath2 stands for the dimension .",
    "thus it is potentially possible to reduce the number of species by breaking hypercubic symmetry properly .",
    "actually , the staggered fermion approach @xcite , with only 4 species of fermions does this and possesses flavored - hypercubic symmetry instead .",
    "however this requires rooting procedures for the physical @xmath3 or @xmath4-flavor qcd simulation , which is known to mutilate certain processes .",
    "an interesting goal is a fermion action with only @xmath3 species , the minimal number required by the no - go theorem .",
    "more than 20 years ago , karsten and wilczek proposed such a minimally doubled action @xcite .",
    "recently one of the authors of the present paper @xcite has also proposed a two - parameter class of fermion actions , inspired by the relativistic condensed matter system , graphene @xcite .",
    "these minimally doubled fermions all possess one exact chiral symmetry and exact locality . as such they should be faster for simulation , at least for two - flavor qcd , than other chirally symmetric lattice fermions .",
    "however it has been shown @xcite that we need to fine - tune several parameters for a continuum limit with these actions .",
    "this is because they lack sufficient discrete symmetry to prohibit redundant operators from being generated through loop corrections @xcite .",
    "thus the minimally doubled fermions have not been extensively used so far . nevertheless , there is the possibility to apply them to simulations if one can efficiently perform the necessary fine - tuning of parameters . to understand",
    "how far we can reduce the number of fine - tuning parameters , it should be useful to investigate and classify as many minimally doubled fermions as possible .    in this paper",
    "we propose a systematic method to reduce the number of doublers , which we term the  twisted - ordering method \" . in this way",
    "we obtain new classes of minimally doubled fermions .",
    "we study symmetries of these fermion actions and show @xmath5 invariance and @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "it is also pointed out that they all also require fine - tuning of several parameters for a correct continuum limit because of lack of sufficient discrete symmetries .",
    "we classify the known minimally doubled actions into two types . by this classification",
    "we can derive several further minimally doubled actions deductively .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : tom ] we present the twisted - ordering method and derive a new class of minimally doubled fermion actions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mdf ] we show that two classes of minimally doubled actions arise from the original twisted - ordering actions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sym ] we investigate the symmetries of these fermion actions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cl ] we discuss two classifications of minimally doubled fermions .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "in this section we propose a systematic way of controlling the number of species of lattice fermions within the requirement of nielsen - ninomiya s no - go theorem .",
    "we will firstly discuss the @xmath3-dimensional case to give an intuitive understanding of this mechanism .",
    "then we will go on to the @xmath7-dimensional case and show we can construct a new minimally doubled action by this method .",
    "let us begin with the following simple @xmath3-dimensional dirac operator in momentum space with @xmath0 wilson - like terms .",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 stand for @xmath3-dimensional momenta and gamma matrices respectively . here",
    "the deviation from the usual wilson action is that the @xmath0 terms are accompanied by gamma matrices .",
    "there are four zeros of this dirac operator at @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the number of the species is the same as for naive fermions .",
    "next we `` twist '' the order of the @xmath0 terms , or equivalently , permute @xmath14 and @xmath15 to give @xmath16 here only two of the zeros ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) remain and the other two are eliminated .",
    "thus the number of species becomes two , the minimal number required by the no - go theorem . as seen from this example , twisting of the order of @xmath0 terms reduces the number of species .",
    "we call this method  twisted - ordering \" in the rest of this paper .",
    "we depict the appearance of zeros in the brillouin zone for the above two cases in fig .",
    "[ ut ] and [ 1 t ] .",
    "the red - dotted and blue - solid curves represent the zeros of the coefficients of @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . these curves intersect at only two points for the twisted case in fig .",
    "[ 1 t ] .",

    "red - dotted and blue - solid lines stand for zeros of the coefficients of @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively in eq .",

    "black points stand for the four zeros of the dirac operator .",
    ", height=264 ]    -dimensional twisted case is depicted within the brillouin zone .",
    "red - dotted and blue - solid curves stand for zeros of the coefficients of @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively in eq .",
    "( [ 2d1 t ] ) .",
    "black points stand for two zeros ( @xmath19 ) ( @xmath20 ) of the dirac operator .,height=264 ]    now consider excitations and the physical ( @xmath21 ) s at the two zeros . here",
    "the physical @xmath21 at a zero is defined as the product of four coefficient matrices of momenta in the excitation as we will concretely show later .",
    "now the dirac operator is expanded about the zeros as @xmath22 here we expand with respect to @xmath23 defined as @xmath24 and we denote the two expansions as @xmath25 for the zero ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath26 for the other at @xmath18 . here momentum bases at the zero @xmath17 are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 while those at the other @xmath18 are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this means excitations from the two zeros describe physical fermions on the orthogonal lattice . and the @xmath21 at @xmath31 , which we denote as @xmath32 , is given by @xmath33 while the @xmath21 at @xmath34 , which we denote as @xmath35 , is given by @xmath36 this sign change between the species is a typical relation between two species with minimal doubling since nielsen - ninomiya s no - go theorem requires fermion pairs to possess chiral charges with opposite signs .",
    "now let us go to the @xmath7-dimensional twisted - ordering method .",
    "here we again start with the following simple action with @xmath0 wilson - like terms @xmath37 here each of the four momentum components can take either @xmath38 or @xmath39 for zeros of this dirac operator .",
    "it means the associated fermion action gives @xmath40 species doublers , the same as for naive fermions .",
    "then we firstly consider the case with twisting the order of @xmath0 terms once @xmath41 where we permute the order of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "here we find that there are @xmath44 zeros of the dirac operator at @xmath45 the associated action yields @xmath44 species of doublers .",
    "as seen from this example , the twisted - ordering method reduces the number of species also in @xmath7-dimensions . in",
    "this case twisting is performed only once , and the number of species is reduced by a factor of two .    secondly we permute @xmath14 and @xmath15 in addition to @xmath46 and @xmath43 to give @xmath47 in this case there are only @xmath7 zeros at @xmath48 thus the associated action yields @xmath7 species of doublers .",
    "this example indicates that more twisting results in additional reduction of species . in these two examples , eqs .",
    "( [ 4d1 t ] ) and ( [ 4d2 t ] ) , twisting is performed partially , and so we call this kind of procedures  partially - twisted - ordering \" .",
    "finally we consider a case that the order of @xmath0 terms are maximally twisted : we permute the @xmath49 terms in a cyclic way to give @xmath50 in this case there are only @xmath3 zeros at @xmath51 we have confirmed there are no other real zeros of this operator numerically , and we will discuss an analytical proof in the next section .",
    "there are only two species in this case , the minimal number required by the no - go theorem .",
    "this is a new type of minimally doubled fermion on the orthogonal lattice .",
    "now we study the excitations and @xmath21 s at the two zeros in a similar way to the @xmath3-dimensional case , @xmath52 where we expand the dirac operator ( [ 4dmt ] ) around zeros with respect to @xmath23 defined as @xmath24 and we denote the two expansions as @xmath25 for the zero ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 for the other @xmath55 .",
    "momentum bases at the zero @xmath56 are given by @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 while those at the other zero at @xmath55 are given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this means excitations from the two zeros describe physical fermions on the orthogonal lattice again . and the @xmath21 at @xmath65 , which we denote as @xmath66 , is given by @xmath67 while the @xmath21 at @xmath68 , which we denote as @xmath35 is given by @xmath69 this is a typical relation between the two species with minimal - doubling .",
    "gauging these theories is straightforward .",
    "one merely inserts the gauge fields as link operators in the hopping terms for the action in position space .",
    "specifically , for the twisted - ordering minimally doubled fermion in position space we have @xmath70 , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath71 we note that in the twisted - ordering method , we control the number of species by choosing the extent of breaking of discrete symmetries of the action .",
    "twisting of @xmath0 terms leads to breaking of the hypercubic symmetry . on the other hand",
    "it is well - known that hypercubic symmetry of the lattice fermion action requires @xmath40 species as shown in @xcite .",
    "thus it is reasonable that more breaking of discrete symmetries can lead to less doubling .",
    "in this section we discuss two classes of minimally doubled actions obtained from the original twisted - ordering action ( [ 4dmt ] ) . the first one , which we call the `` dropped twisted - ordering action '' , is constructed as following : we drop one of @xmath72 terms in the dirac operator ( [ 4dmt ] ) , for example , drop @xmath73 as @xmath74 this has two zeros given by @xmath75 thus the associated action is also a minimally doubled action . here",
    "the two ( @xmath21 ) s at the two zeros also have opposite signs @xmath76 where @xmath77 corresponds to @xmath56 and @xmath35 to @xmath78 .",
    "we can also confirm this action describes physical fermions on the orthogonal lattice by looking into excitations from the zeros as in the previous section .",
    "we depict the appearance of zeros for the two dimensional case of the dropped twisted - ordering action in fig .",
    "we see there are only two zeros as @xmath17 and @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath7-dimensional case is similar .    ) in the @xmath3-dimensional analogy .",
    "red - dotted and blue - solid lines stand for zeros of the coefficients of @xmath80 and @xmath12 , namely ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "black dots show two zeros @xmath17 and @xmath79.,height=264 ]    here we comment on definition of the equivalence of actions .",
    "we can convert one fermion action to an equivalent one with a different form by momentum shift and rotation of gamma matrices . here",
    "the momentum shift means @xmath83 where @xmath84 are some constant four vector .",
    "the rotation of gamma matrices means @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an orthogonal matrix .",
    "although by using such a shift and rotation we can control the location of two zeros with the distance and direction between them fixed , the original and transformed actions are clearly equivalent .",
    "now we can easily see the original ( [ 4dmt ] ) and dropped twisted - ordering ( [ 4dmt - d ] ) actions never translate into borici @xcite or karsten - wilczek @xcite actions through these two procedures .",
    "it means our actions are independent and new ones .    next we consider a second generalization where we turn on a parameter in the action ( [ 4dmt ] ) as following , @xmath87 here we replace unity with a positive parameter @xmath88 in the constant terms of the operator .",
    "we will also call this one the twisted - ordering fermion action in the rest of this paper .",
    "the @xmath89 case corresponds to the original case .",
    "now , in order to investigate the parameter range within which  minimal - doubling \" is realized , we define @xmath90 and rewrite the equations for zeros in terms of these variables @xmath91 to make it easier to see we rewrite this as @xmath92 where in principle there are @xmath40 complex solutions . the number of solutions of this system is the same as the original ones ( [ 4dmt - a])([4dmt - x1 ] ) .",
    "thus we can study the range of the parameter for minimal - doubling by looking into how many real solutions this system of equations has . by eliminating @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we obtain the following equation for @xmath96 @xmath97 where we can confirm this by using software such as maxima .",
    "this means , except for @xmath98 , there are only the two solutions @xmath99 from this @xmath88 should be below @xmath100 so that the solutions are real . for @xmath98 the above equation ( [ 4deq - xonly ] )",
    "is satisfied by any value of @xmath96 , which means that zeros appear as a one - dimensional curve , not a point .",
    "we will discuss this in detail later .",
    "we find there are two real solutions in the range @xmath101 , which corresponds to a pair of minimally doubled species .",
    "this is the range of the parameter @xmath88 for minimal - doubling .",
    "we can also verify this minimal - doubling range numerically .",
    "what is significant for @xmath98 is that zeros of the dirac operator ( [ 4dmt - a ] ) appear as an one - dimensional curve , not a point , in the momentum space .",
    "we can confirm this as following .",
    "equations for zeros of the dirac operator ( [ 4dmt - a ] ) at @xmath98 are given by @xmath102 these equations are satisfied by @xmath103 where we ignore the arbitrariness of adding @xmath104 .",
    "as seen from these relations , the solution appears as an one - dimensional curve .",
    "for example , you find the following curve satisfies the above equations : @xmath105 where @xmath106 can take an arbitrary value",
    ". we can also understand this from the fact that ( [ 4dmt - x2 ] ) reduces to three independent equations for @xmath98 .",
    "this emergence of a line solution indicates that the excitation around zeros for a small @xmath88 becomes incompatible with a lorentz - covariant or a dirac form .",
    "due to these nonlinear corrections , we conclude that we should use this action only with @xmath88 substantially away from @xmath107 .",
    "this property at @xmath98 is also the case for any even number of dimensions .",
    "we can visualize the allowed range of the parameter @xmath88 from the @xmath3-dimensional analogy . in the @xmath3d case the upper limit of @xmath108",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ upper ] . for @xmath100",
    "the two zeros join to a double zero , where the excitation is not lorentz - covariant . for a lower limit",
    ", the @xmath3d analogy shows  minimal - doubling \" persists as long as @xmath88 is positive .",
    "we depict @xmath3d cases for @xmath109 and @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ lower1 ] and [ al0 ] . for @xmath98",
    "the solution appears as an one - dimensional line , thus there is no simple pole in the propagator .",
    "we conclude that the parameter range for minimal - doubling in both @xmath3 and @xmath7 dimensions is given by @xmath110 in this range two zeros of the @xmath7d dirac operator , which we denote as @xmath111 and @xmath112 , are given by @xmath113 where for convenience we define a parameter @xmath114 as @xmath115 .",
    "these two zeros reduce to eq .",
    "( [ z-4dmt ] ) with @xmath89 .",
    "excitations from these zeros are given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 corrections are not negligible for a small @xmath88 as we have discussed .",

    "they are clearly non - orthogonal for cases of @xmath127 thus the associated lattices are non - orthogonal as with the creutz fermion @xcite .",
    "we note we have confirmed the parameter range for minimal - doubling ( [ mdr ] ) is also the case with other even dimensions ( @xmath128 ) . from this fact we can anticipate this is a universal property for this class of actions for any even dimensions",

    "there are piled lines composed of red and blue lines , which stand for one - dimensional line solutions.,height=264 ]    here we comment on the ranges of the parameter for minimal - doubling in odd dimensions .",
    "for example , in the @xmath135d case , we can rewrite analogous equations for zeros of the operator with @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 as @xmath139 by eliminating @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we obtain the following equation for @xmath96 , @xmath140 as seen from this there are two real solutions similar with the @xmath7d case for @xmath141 as @xmath142 however , in this case we have six more complex solutions which come from the other factor ( [ 3deq - xonly ] ) .",
    "the question is how many real solutions this equation has .",
    "we have studied it numerically and found six real solutions exist below a critical value of @xmath88 as @xmath143 while there are six complex solutions above it .",
    "thus the minimal - doubling parameter range in the @xmath135d case is given by @xmath144 in this case the lower limit is non - zero while the upper limit is the same as even dimensional cases .",
    "indeed we can numerically confirm this kind of nonzero lower limit is also the case with any odd dimensional twisted - ordering action .",
    "we can explain the reason that there is such difference between the even and odd dimensional cases as following : as seen from ( [ 3deq - x ] ) , there are @xmath2 independent equations even for @xmath98 in the ( @xmath145)-dim cases ( @xmath146 ) while there are only @xmath147 equations in the even dimensions for @xmath98 .",
    "this means that the dirac operator can have @xmath1 zeros for @xmath98 in the odd dimensional cases while zeros appear as a curve in even dimensions . actually , as seen from ( [ 3deq - xonly ] ) , there are @xmath1 independent real solutions for @xmath98 in the odd dimensions .",
    "since only two zeros exist for @xmath89 also for odd dimensions , there must be a critical point between @xmath98 and @xmath89 in odd dimensions .",
    "in the previous section we have studied two classes of minimally doubled actions in ( [ 4dmt - d ] ) and ( [ 4dmt - a ] ) , both of which are obtained from the twisted - ordering action in ( [ 4dmt ] ) . in this section",
    "we will discuss discrete symmetries of these actions and redundant operators generated by loop corrections .",
    "firstly we note both of the actions possess some common properties with other minimally doubled fermions :  gamma - five hermiticity \" ,  discrete translation invariance \" ,  flavor - singlet @xmath148 \" and  flavor - nonsinglet @xmath149 . \"",
    "the latter is the exact chiral symmetry preventing additive mass renormalization for the neutral pion .",
    "in addition to them , they have exact locality and gauge invariance when gauged by link variables .",
    "we expect every sensible minimally doubled fermion to possess these basic properties .",
    "on the other hand , discrete symmetries associated with permutation of the axes and @xmath150 , @xmath151 or @xmath152 invariance depends on a class of the actions . in other words , we can identify minimally doubled actions by these discrete symmetries . here",
    "we show discrete symmetries which the dropped twisted - ordering action possesses :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath5 ,    \\2 .",
    "@xmath152 ,    \\3 .",
    "@xmath153 associated with two zeros .    here",
    "we take the @xmath154 direction as time .",
    "we also write the symmetries which the full twisted - ordering action possesses :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath155 ,    \\2 .",
    "@xmath6 associated with axes permutation ,    \\3 . @xmath153",
    "associated with two zeros .",
    "there is also the possibility to utilize the above @xmath153 symmetry in order to recover flavored-@xmath150 , @xmath151 or @xmath152 symmetry .",
    "actually borici - creutz action has a flavored-@xmath150 symmetry @xcite .",
    "however we do not further discuss here details of this point , to which a future work will be devoted .",
    "the dropped twisted - ordering action has @xmath5 and @xmath152 invariance .",
    "we consider what redundant operators can be generated radiatively in this action following the prescription shown in @xcite .",
    "the relevant and marginal operators generated through loop corrections are given by @xmath156 and @xmath157 these operators are allowed by the symmetries for possessed by the action .",
    "note that the marginal operators include a renormalization of the speed of light , both for the fermions and the gluons .",
    "on the other hand , the case of twisted - ordering action is similar to that of borici - creutz action which has higher symmetry @xmath158 than @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that there are more redundant operators generated in the twisted - ordering action than those of borici - creutz one shown in @xcite .",
    "however in the future we need to confirm that this reduction of symmetry does not affect the number of redundant operators . then we will know whether or not this class is more useful than the borici - creutz class .",
    "in this section we discuss a classification of the known minimally doubled fermions .",
    "so far we have seen four variations on minimally doubled fermions : karsten - wilczek , borici - creutz , twisted - ordering and dropped twisted - ordering fermions . here",
    "we classify these actions into two types : one of them , which includes karsten - wilczek and dropped twisted - ordering actions , is given by @xmath159 where we take @xmath160 as @xmath161 while @xmath162 as @xmath163 .",
    "the point is that indices @xmath161 and @xmath163 are staggered .",
    "the different actions in this class depend on the choice for the matrix @xmath164 .",
    "for example , consider the following @xmath164 s @xmath165 in the case of ( [ rkw ] ) , the general form ( [ gene1 ] ) reduces to karsten - wilczek action as following , @xmath166 here you can also add an overall factor as a parameter to @xmath164 .",
    "actually the original karsten - wilczek action includes such a parameter @xmath167 in front of @xmath0 terms with a minimal - doubling range of the parameter @xmath168 .    in the case of ( [ rt ] ) , this reduces to the dropped twisted - ordering action @xmath169 where you can also add an overall parameter to @xmath164 .",
    "finally , the action for the case ( [ rnew ] ) is a new possibility , given by @xmath170    we see that there are many options associated with possible @xmath164 s .",
    "one common property with fermions obtained in this way is that two zeros are separated along a single lattice axis and given by @xmath56 and @xmath78 .",
    "one significance about the general form ( [ gene1 ] ) is that a coefficient of at least one gamma matrix has no @xmath171 term .",
    "it is also notable that , in a coefficient of each gamma matrix , a momentum component @xmath172 associated with a sine term differs from the component in any cosine term .",
    "these two points seem to be essential to minimal - doubling . here",
    "we note minimal - doubling still persists if we add a @xmath173 term to any actions obtained from ( [ gene1 ] ) . we can change the location of the two zeros by adding such a term with a parameter .    here",
    "let us comment on a sufficient condition of @xmath164 for minimal - doubling .",
    "we found minimal - doubling is realized when you take the following class of @xmath164 s : @xmath164 s composed by three column vectors as @xmath174 with each vector @xmath175 ( @xmath160 ) taken as @xmath176 , @xmath177 or @xmath178 .",
    "all the examples we have shown here satisfy this condition .",
    "however we have not yet revealed a necessary condition for this .",
    "our future work will be devoted to revealing such a condition .",
    "the second class of actions includes the twisted - ordering fermion with the @xmath88 parameter and the borici - creutz actions .",
    "a generalized dirac operator for this type is given by @xmath179\\,-\\ , i\\gamma , \\label{gene2}\\ ] ] where @xmath180 is another set of gamma matrices where we define @xmath114 as an orthogonal matrix with some conditions : at least one eigenvalue of @xmath114 should be @xmath181 and all four components of the associated eigenvector should have non - zero values .",
    "here @xmath182 and @xmath183 has a relation with this @xmath114 as @xmath184 , which means @xmath185 is an eigenvector of @xmath114 as @xmath186 .",
    "thus once @xmath114 is fixed , @xmath182 and @xmath183 are determined up to a overall factor of @xmath185 . by imposing these conditions on @xmath114 , @xmath182 and @xmath183",
    ", the action ( [ gene2 ] ) can be a minimally doubled action .",
    "in such a case @xmath182 indicates locations of two zeros as @xmath187 .",
    "adjusting @xmath188 , we can control the locations of the zeros .",
    "note that the first and second terms in ( [ gene2 ] ) are nothing but naive fermion actions .",
    "we can eliminate some species by combining two naive actions with different zeros in one action .    now let us show this action includes minimally doubled actions .",
    "firstly this general form in ( [ gene2 ] ) reduces to borici action by choosing @xmath114 , which is given by @xmath189 where we fix @xmath190 thus @xmath183 is given by @xmath191 .",
    "this general form ( [ gene2 ] ) also yields the twisted - ordering action . for this",
    "we take the following matrix @xmath114 @xmath192 fix @xmath190 , and @xmath183 is given by @xmath193 .",
    "then the general form reduces to the twisted - ordering action with @xmath89 .",
    "we can also obtain the @xmath127 case by choosing other values of @xmath182 .",
    "for @xmath101 we take @xmath194 along with which an overall factor for @xmath183 changes .",
    "we note this general form ( [ gene2 ] ) also includes non - minimally doubled actions like the partially twisted - ordering actions in ( [ 4d1 t ] ) and ( [ 4d2 t ] ) . here",
    "let us consider @xmath195 and fix @xmath185 where @xmath183 is given by @xmath193 .",
    "this clearly gives the partially - twisted - ordering action in ( [ 4d2 t ] ) .",
    "finally we have classified the known minimally doubled fermions into the two types .",
    "now we can derive a lot of varieties from these general forms deductively as we have shown in ( [ new ] ) .",
    "however the second type of general actions ( [ gene2 ] ) is not restricted only to minimally doubled fermions .",
    "we may be able to restrict it by imposing other conditions .",
    "we note the two fermion actions which we derived from the twisted - ordering method , namely twisted - ordering and dropped twisted - ordering , belong to different types of minimally doubled fermions although they look similar to each other .",
    "in this paper we study a variety of new classes of minimally doubled fermions and a classification of all the known cases . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tom ] we propose a systematic method to reduce the number of species , the  twisted - ordering method \" . in this method",
    "we can choose @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath44 and @xmath40 as the number of species by controlling discrete symmetry breaking . by using this method",
    "we obtain new classes of minimally doubled fermions , which we call twisted - ordering and dropped twisted - ordering actions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mdf ] we study these two classes in terms of the parameter range for minimal - doubling . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sym ] we study discrete symmetries of these fermion actions and show twisted - ordering action has @xmath6 symmetry while dropped twisted - ordering action possesses @xmath5 invariance .",
    "we also show they require fine - tuning of several parameters for a correct continuum limit because of lack of sufficient discrete symmetries in the known classes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cl ] we classify all the known minimally doubled actions into two types .",
    "we can derive several unknown minimally doubled actions by this classification .    with several varieties of minimally doubled fermion actions available ,",
    "a goal is to apply these actions to numerical simulations and study their relative advantages . in particular",
    "it is important to investigate how many fine - tuning parameters are required for a good continuum limit and how difficult this tuning is . this kind of study was started in @xcite .",
    "recently renormalization of the operators has been also studied in @xcite . both of these studies focused on karsten - wilczek and borici - creutz fermions .",
    "one can now explore other varieties such as ones in this paper . with a better understanding of their properties",
    ", one can go on to larger numerical calculations .",
