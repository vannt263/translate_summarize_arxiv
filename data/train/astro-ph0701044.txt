    "in a star cluster moving in a circular orbit about the axis of symmetry of a galaxy , a star is subject to the self - gravity of the cluster and the tidal field of the galaxy . if studied in a rotating , accelerating frame following the orbital motion of the cluster , it is also subject to centrifugal and coriolis forces",
    ". if the spatial distribution of stars is uniform within an ellipsoid , and if the usual linear approximation of the tidal field is adopted , the accelerations inside the ellipsoid are all linear in the spatial coordinates .",
    "there are then two normal modes of oscillation in planes orthogonal to the axis of rotation .",
    "@xcite studied this problem in the case when one of the normal frequencies is imaginary .",
    "taking for convenience the case of an ellipsoid of revolution , they showed that it was possible to choose the axial ratio so that it was equal to that of the orbits in the remaining normal mode . by a very simple orbit superposition it was possible to construct a self - consistent model .",
    "this problem closely resembles that of constructing a model of a uniform , rotating ellipsoidal bar ( freeman 1966a , b , c ; hunter 1974 , 1975 ) . this goal has been achieved in three cases : ( i ) elliptical cylinders ,",
    "in which the semi - major axis parallel to the axis of rotation is infinite ; ( ii ) so - called `` balanced '' systems , in which the centrifugal and gravitational forces are equal along the major axis ; and ( iii ) disks with the surface density that is obtained by projecting a uniform ellipsoid onto one plane .    in this paper",
    "we set out the connection between these two problems , and give a more systematic treatment of the models which fellhauer & heggie stumbled upon . in principle",
    "there are three dimensionless parameters : two axial ratios , and one parameter which measures the density of the system .",
    "the requirement of choosing one axial ratio appropriately reduces the family to a two - parameter family .",
    "fellhauer & heggie chose to work with axisymmetric models , which simplifies consideration to a one - parameter family . in cases where both normal frequencies are real",
    ", however , it is clear that there is a possibility of a second two - parameter family .",
    "finally , when this second eigenfrequency is zero , the problem is equivalent to that of freeman s `` balanced '' bar .",
    "we begin in the next section with a summary of the equations of motion and their solution . then section 3 surveys the models based on a single normal mode , and those which exploit the idea behind freeman s bar model .",
    "the paper concludes with some final discussion , and an appendix describes the models in terms of distribution functions .",
    "we use the rotating , accelerating frame in which the centre of the ellipsoidal star cluster is at the origin , the @xmath0-axis points to the centre of the galaxy , and the @xmath1-axis points in the direction of orbital motion of the system .",
    "( fellhauer & heggie took the @xmath1-axis in the opposite direction , but we switch in order to increase the resemblance with the theory as set out by freeman . )",
    "then the equations of motion are @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the angular velocity about the galaxy , @xmath4 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath5 is the frequency of small motions orthogonal to the galactic orbit of the cluster ( if the cluster itself is neglected ) , and @xmath6 are coefficients of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the expression for the gravitational potential inside a uniform ellipsoid with semi - axes @xmath9 .",
    "( they are functions of the density ( @xmath10 ) and the axial ratios @xmath11 . ) for @xmath12 , these expressions are given in @xcite , eqs.(4)-(12 ) , which we would refer to henceforth as fii.4 - 12 , with corresponding abbreviations for equations in his two other papers .",
    "equivalent formulae will be found in table 2 - 1 of @xcite , along with the special forms corresponding to axisymmetrical and spherical cases .",
    "thus @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( cf .",
    "fi.8 , fii.16 ) .",
    "for @xmath15 the solutions of these equations are @xmath16 ( fi.9 , fii.17c ) , where @xmath17 are arbitrary constants , which we can take positive , @xmath18 are arbitrary constants , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the two roots for @xmath21 of the quartic @xmath22 ( fi.10 - 11 ) .",
    "we adopt freeman s convention that @xmath23 when both frequencies are real ; when one frequency is imaginary ( a case not considered by freeman ) we denote the single real frequency by @xmath24 .",
    "then both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are positive .",
    "note also that , for a given galactic potential , they are functions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we first summarise the family of self - consistent models which generalises those found by @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath29 in eqs.([eq : orbitx ] ) .",
    "the models are then built from the normal mode with frequency @xmath24 , and so we refer to them as @xmath24-models .",
    "we can construct self - consistent models provided that @xmath30 .",
    "when the frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath31 are incommensurable , each orbit fills the curved surface of an elliptic cylinder .",
    "the upper end of this cylinder is the ellipse @xmath32 , which lies on the surface of the ellipsoid @xmath33 if @xmath34 .",
    "thus in general @xmath35 provided that @xmath36 .    for given @xmath37",
    "the distribution of @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "given @xmath40 , we choose the distribution of @xmath41 according to @xmath42 ( for the case @xmath43 , considered by fellhauer & heggie , this is equivalent to their eq.(19 ) . ) with this choice we see easily that @xmath38 is uniformly distributed in @xmath44 .",
    "finally , in order to generate a spatially uniform density , we choose the distribution of @xmath40 so that @xmath45 is proportional to the mass inside the cluster in the cylindrical volume between @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 ( cf .",
    "fellhauer & heggie , eq.(18 ) ) . while these formulae are convenient for constructing a model , we also ( section [ sec : betadf ] ) provide a more conventional definition in terms of a distribution function in phase space .",
    "our purpose now is to sketch the range of models which satisfy the essential requirement @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath26 is a function of @xmath48 and @xmath28 , this equation may be solved for @xmath10 as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath28 .",
    "this can be exhibited by plotting contours of @xmath10 in the plane @xmath50 .",
    "results of a numerical survey are shown in fig.1 , where for definiteness we consider the case of an isothermal galaxy potential , in which @xmath51 .",
    "two limiting cases can be discerned :    1 .   _",
    "low density : _ if @xmath52 then @xmath53 and @xmath54 , by eqs.([eq : frequencies ] ) , ( [ eq : kbeta ] ) .",
    "this is the limit at the extreme right of fig.1 .",
    "axisymmetric models : _ if @xmath10 is very large and @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 and @xmath57 , by the same pair of equations",
    ". this limit is reached at the extreme left of fig.1 .",
    "the models discussed by @xcite lie on the line @xmath58 in fig.1 .",
    "( this subfamily is also depicted in fig.4 . )",
    "we now see that they are part of a two - parameter family .      for sufficiently low densities ,",
    "the value of @xmath60 is negative , and orbital motions are unstable . for higher densities , however , @xmath61 and so we have another family of self - consistent models where now @xmath62 and @xmath63 . these we refer to as @xmath59 models .",
    "their distribution in parameter space is shown in fig.2 .",
    "again there are axisymmetric models of arbitrarily high density .",
    "the construction of these models is exactly analogous to that of @xmath24-models . again",
    "the subfamily on which @xmath58 is depicted in fig.4 .      in f.ii",
    ", freeman described a series of three - dimensional ellipsoidal models of uniform density for the case in which @xmath64 . in the galactic context this was referred to as the condition for a `` balanced '' ellipsoid . for star clusters",
    "the corresponding interpretation is that of a system which is marginally stable against tidal disruption , as @xmath65 . they appear to exist only for @xmath66 approximately , and",
    "their distribution is shown in fig.3 .",
    "for the case considered here , eqs.([eq : orbitx]a , b ) are replaced by @xmath67 ( fii.17 , with some changes of notation ) , where now @xmath68 , and the constant term @xmath69 represents the zero - frequency mode .",
    "the effect of this term is that epicycles can be placed with guiding centre at any point along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "this freedom allows the construction of models with an axial ratio different from that of the epicycles .",
    "a little thought , however , shows that the axial ratio of the epicycles ( @xmath26 ) must exceed that of the cluster ( @xmath49 ) in order that all parts of the cluster are accessible by epicycles lying entirely within it .",
    "this condition ( which is best thought of as an upper limit to @xmath49 ) gives the near - vertical curve at about @xmath70 in fig.[fig : freeman ] ; realisable models must lie to the left of this line .",
    "this curve represents the intersection of the families of freeman and beta models , as can be seen in the cross section in fig.[fig : all ] .",
    "an attractive special case is the spherical model @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath72 , and so eq.([eq : balance ] ) , with @xmath73 , yields @xmath74 .",
    "a typical orbit is shown in fig.[fig : orbit ] .        for freeman models",
    "it was found convenient to generate initial conditions from the distribution function , which is described in fii .",
    "in this paper we have considered the problem of constructing an exact self - consistent equilibrium of a star cluster in a tidal field .",
    "the usual linear approximation of the tidal field is adopted , and we assume that the motion of the cluster in the galaxy is uniform and circular .",
    "we have found three distinct families of models , in all of which the cluster is an ellipsoid of uniform density .",
    "each is a two - parameter family , the two parameters being the axial ratios of the ellipsoid .",
    "additional free parameters are the angular frequency of the motion around the galaxy and the radius of the cluster .",
    "all three models are built of epicyclic motions , of the kind which are familiar in galactic dynamics , though the details of the orbits are modified by the action of the cluster potential . in two families of models ,",
    "one of which was partially explored by @xcite , the space density is built up by epicycles whose guiding centre lies at the centre of the cluster and whose axial ratio ( in the @xmath75 directions ) coincides with that of the ellipsoid .",
    "we call these @xmath59- and @xmath24-models . in a third family the guiding centre of the epicycles",
    "may be displaced at various points along the @xmath0-axis , which points to the galactic centre .",
    "this family closely resembles freeman s family of `` balanced '' models for barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "one of the families has models for all values of the space density ( for suitable choice of axial ratio ) , while the other two exist only for densities above a certain minimum value .",
    "we have given enough details of the distribution functions associated with these models to allow explicit @xmath76-body realisations of them to be constructed .",
    "code is available from the authors for the construction of the @xmath59- and @xmath24-models , and for the spherical freeman model .",
    "an interesting extension of the study of these models would be consideration of their dynamical evolution , under both collisionless and collisional processes . for a one - dimensional subfamily of the @xmath24-models",
    "this was considered by @xcite , with particular emphasis on low - density models .",
    "they found that the models are unstable , and that the time scale of the instability increases as the density decreases . though they did not explore high - density models in such detail",
    ", their results indicated that the lifetime increases again at the highest end of the range they studied .",
    "the question arises whether it is possible to construct more general models along these lines .",
    "though no further analytic models have been found yet , it has been pointed out to us by j.p .",
    "ostriker that this problem seems well suited to schwarzschild s orbit - superposition method @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank r.h .",
    "miller for drawing to our attention the possibility that the @xmath24-models might be related to freeman s bar models .",

    "we invoke jeans theorem and express the distribution function as a function of the isolating integrals of motion .",
    "as shown in fi and fii these are @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "these are in fact the energies of the three normal modes , and the total energy is @xmath79 .    by combining results in fi.41 and fii.27",
    ", we see that the condition that the envelope of this orbit just touches the surface of the model is @xmath80 , where , in general , @xmath81 this expression is very useful for constructing distribution functions vanishing outside the surface of the model . when @xmath59 is imaginary only the @xmath24-models exist , and then @xmath82 . when @xmath65 we have the case of freeman models , and then we find somewhat different expressions for @xmath83 and the quantities it contains ( fii ) . in general , fi.1219 are a useful resource of handy identities for checking some of the expressions in the following subsections .",
