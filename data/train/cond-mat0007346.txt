    "in this work , we studied the excitonic energy levels in an asymmetric vertical double quantum well @xcite-@xcite as a function of the magnetic and electric field strengths . within the effective - mass approach we expanded the excitonic wave function in an orthogonal basis formed by products of electron and hole wave functions along the crystal growth direction @xmath4 , and one - particle solutions of the magnetic hamiltonian in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane .",
    "the coulomb potential between electrons and holes produces off - diagonal terms thus mixing our basis states .",
    "we obtained the energy spectra and wave functions by diagonalizing the excitonic hamiltonian in a truncated basis .",
    "we applied our method to study the excitonic states in a gaas al@xmath0ga@xmath1as dqw , for the specific case of a dqw composed of a left well of @xmath7 nm , a barrier of @xmath8 nm , and a right well of @xmath9 nm . the effects of external electric and magnetic fields on the luminescence ( pl ) intensity for this heterostructure has been recently studied experimentally by krivolapchuk et al.@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the effective - mass hamiltonian for excitons in a double quantum well in the diagonal approximation @xcite and in the presence of a magnetic field pointing towards @xmath4 , can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the one - dimensional hamiltonian for electrons , @xmath12 @xmath13 is the one - dimensional hamiltonian for holes , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the potential that defines the double quantum well for electrons ( holes ) in the five regions of @xmath4 .",
    "we included the electric field in @xmath15 and @xmath16 by a shift in the potential in stair steps similar to fig .",

    "@xmath17 is the magnetic hamiltonian in the symmetric gauge , which depends on the relative coordinates of electrons and holes in the @xmath18 plane , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the momentum operator , reduced mass , and hole mass respectively , defined on the @xmath18 plane .",
    "@xmath23 is the coulomb potential between electrons and holes , including an effective dielectric constant for the system .",
    "we expanded the solutions of the hamiltonian ( [ h - total ] ) , as a linear combination of products of eigenfunctions of the magnetic hamiltonian in the @xmath18 plane ( [ h - mag ] ) , and eigenfunctions of the electron and hole hamiltonians in the @xmath4 direction [ ( [ h - ele ] ) and ( [ h - hole ] ) ] , @xmath24 in which , in the symmetric gauge , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and only @xmath27 functions are considered .",
    "the electron wave functions defined in the five regions of @xmath4 , shown in fig",
    ".  [ pot - z ] , are given in terms of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the hole wave functions are given by similar expressions .",
    "the coulomb interaction produces off - diagonal terms by mixing our basis states . in order to obtain the system of equations for the coefficients in expansion ( [ expansion ] ) , we need to evaluate the coulomb integrals @xmath31    the @xmath32 integral is trivial , because of @xmath33 conservation . using the explicit expansion of laguerre polynomials ( @xmath34 ) in @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( [ f - mag ] ) and after solving the @xmath37 integral , eqn .",
    "( [ i - total ] ) can be written as a sum of terms of the form @xmath38    the @xmath39- and @xmath40- integrals can be solved analytically . the evaluation of these integrals is cumbersome due to the large number of terms , resulting from the five different regions of the potential .",
    "the @xmath39- and @xmath40- integrals contain both decoupled terms in which the @xmath39- and @xmath40- integrals are independent of each other and coupled terms where the integration limits of the @xmath40-integral contains @xmath39 .",
    "the remaining @xmath41 integral must be calculated numerically .    by diagonalizing the system of equations resulting for the coefficients in expansion ( [ expansion ] ) , in a truncated basis",
    ", we obtained the energies and wave functions for the first excitonic levels .",
    "evaluating the oscillator strength we obtained the optical absorption spectra .",
    "we calculated the excitonic energy levels for a slightly asymmetric 10.18/3.82/9.61 nm gaas al@xmath0ga@xmath1as double quantum well , in the presence of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the band gap used in our calculations is given by @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the band - gap offset considered was @xmath44 for the conduction band and @xmath45 for the valence band .",
    "for all five regions in the double quantum well , we used the same electronic mass @xmath46 , the @xmath18 plane heavy - hole mass , @xmath47 , the @xmath48 heavy - hole mass @xmath49 , the light - hole masses @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and a dielectric constant @xmath52 . in our calculations",
    "we used a truncated basis set composed of @xmath53 landau wave functions , four electronic wave functions , five heavy - hole wave functions , for which most of our results converged to less than a tenth of mev . for magnetic fields below @xmath54 t , we would need to increase the number of landau levels considered .",
    "we included a fictitious width of @xmath55 mev for each optical absorption peak .",
    "in this section we present our results for the energies and wave functions of electron and holes in a one - dimensional dqw , as a function of the external electric field .",
    "we are interested in regions of electric field where two different electron ( or hole ) energy levels cross each other leaving a gap of a few mev between them .",
    "when the wave functions involved in this kind of anticrossing are important for the optical absorption , we expect to find interesting behaviors in the peaks of the excitonic optical absorption .",
    "figure [ e_f ] shows the electron ( upper plot ) and hole ( lower plot ) energy levels for this dqw as a function of the external electric field . in the range from @xmath56 to @xmath57",
    "kv / cm ( not shown in the plot ) , there are crossings in the hole energy levels near @xmath54 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 kv / cm .",
    "these crossings do not met the two conditions explained before , and will not produce a noticeable behavior in the excitonic optical absorption . in the range from @xmath57 to @xmath61",
    "kv / cm there is a region of electric fields near @xmath62 kv / cm , indicated with an arrow , where the second and the third electronic energy levels anticross . to understand the excitonic optical absorption it is necessary to know the behavior of the electron and hole dqw wave functions for electric field below , inside , and above the anticrossing region .",
    "figure [ wf_0 ] shows the first four electron ( upper plot ) and hole ( lower plot ) wave functions for zero external electric field .",
    "numbers indicate the order of the energy levels , and the most important states for the excitonic optical absorption are represented by a solid line .",
    "the first state mostly localized in the left ( wider ) well is called * l1 * and the first state mostly localized in the right well is called * r1*. it is clear from this figure that holes are almost completely localized in the left or right wells , and that electrons have strong components over both wells .",
    "this different behavior for electrons and holes is a consequence of the effective mass differences for electron and holes and the size of the wells and barrier in this sample .",
    "figure [ wf_71 ] shows the electron ( upper plot ) and hole ( lower plot ) wave functions for an external electric field of @xmath63 kv / cm , where the most important states for the excitonic optical absorption are represented by a solid line . comparing with the previous case of electrons in zero electric field ,",
    "we note that : the first level * l1 * get much more localized in the left well , the second level * r1 * changes dramatically into * l2 * , and the third level behaves as * r1*. for holes we can see that the electric field forces the wave functions to be localized in the right well , and the fourth level is localized in the left well ( corresponding to * l1 * ) .",
    "figure [ wf_85 ] shows the electron ( upper plot ) and hole ( lower plot ) wave functions for an external electric field of @xmath61 kv / cm . again the most important states for the excitonic optical absorption are represented by solid lines . comparing with the previous case of a @xmath63",
    "kv / cm electric field , we note that electron wave functions remains almost unchanged , and that the fifth hole wave function behaves as * l1*.      increasing the electric field in a double quantum well produces a shift in the electron and hole energy levels and a change in the localization of the respective wave - functions .",
    "the combination of both effects changes the behavior of the excitonic states and affects , in a non trivial way , the optical absorption spectrum of these systems .",
    "figure [ abs_f ] shows the electric - field effects on the optical absorption spectra for an external magnetic field of @xmath64 t. each curve , corresponding to a different value of the electric field , has been displaced for clarity . for an electric field of @xmath57 kv / cm ( upper curve )",
    "there are two peaks in the excitonic optical absorption .",
    "the first peak corresponds to a direct exciton * l1l1 * , where the constituent electron and hole are localized in the left ( wider ) well .",
    "the second peak corresponds to a direct exciton * r1r1 * , where the electron and hole are localized in the right well . for an electric field of @xmath61 kv / cm ( lower curve )",
    "the same two peaks occur , corresponding again to the left direct exciton * l1l1 * and the right direct exciton * r1r1*. the main difference between the @xmath57 kv / cm and the @xmath61 kv / cm case is the exciton composition in terms of the base states .",
    "this different composition of base states can not be observed experimentally in the previous limiting cases , but has a strong influence in the optical absorption behavior for electric fields between @xmath57 kv / cm and @xmath61 kv / cm .",
    "the complex structure in the optical absorption spectra in this range of electric fields can be explained by the formation of excitonic states , which have a strong component of indirect exciton states . in this case",
    "the indirect exciton state corresponds to * l2r1 * , which is formed by an electron in the second left state and a hole in first right state .",
    "the composition in terms of our base states can be obtained from figures [ wf_0 ] , [ wf_71 ] , and [ wf_85 ] . when comparing this figure with fig . 2 of @xcite",
    ", we see a similar behavior in the pl peaks .",
    "this suggests that the peak attributed to an impurity - bound direct exciton in the experimental results , could be interpreted as a mixed state with direct and indirect exciton components .",
    "quantitative agreement between our results and those in the experimental work is not possible because we included a strong magnetic field .",
    "peaks originating from light holes states appear at the right end of this figure ( not shown ) .      increasing the magnetic field in a double",
    "quantum well produces a shift in the excitonic energy levels towards higher energies and an increase in the interaction energy .",
    "the increase in the interaction energy between electrons and holes is a consequence of two effects : first , the wave function confinement in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane produces a stronger interaction along the @xmath4 direction , as the wave functions penetrate more into the barrier .",
    "second , the interaction between electrons and holes in the same plane increases , because their wave functions are confined to a smaller region .",
    "figure [ abs_b : f=3d71 ] shows the magnetic - field effects on the optical absorption spectra for an external electric field of @xmath63 kv / cm .",
    "the differences in the interaction energies in the layer plane and along the @xmath4 @xmath65 , when the magnetic field is varied , produces a different behavior in the optical absorption peaks with direct or indirect exciton components .",
    "this difference produces the splitting of the first peak for a magnetic field of @xmath54 t into two peaks for stronger magnetic fields .",
    "figure [ abs_b : f=3d78 ] shows the magnetic - field effects on the optical absorption spectra for an external electric field of @xmath66 kv / cm . in this case the magnetic field produces no mixing between excitonic states , and produces different shifts in energies for direct excitons ( * l1l1 * and * r1r1 * ) and the indirect exciton ( * l2r1 * ) .",
    "this effect is clearly observed as a function of magnetic field .",
    "in this work we studied the energies and wave functions of excitonic states in a 10.18/3.82/9.61 nm gaas al@xmath0ga@xmath1as double quantum well , in a magnetic field pointing along the growth direction @xmath4 .",
    "we calculated the optical absorption spectra as a function of the external electric and magnetic fields and studied the behavior in the pl peaks for the indirect exciton @xmath2 and direct exciton @xmath3 .",
    "we compared our results and those in the experimental work of @xcite and found similar behavior in the pl peaks .",
    "this suggests that the peak attributed to an impurity - bound direct exciton in the experimental results , could be interpreted as a mixed state with direct and indirect exciton components .    in our method of calculation",
    "we used an orthogonal basis that involves functions of single - particle solutions of the double quantum well in @xmath4 direction , which makes our method appropriate for small and medium barrier widths .",
    "the study of these systems for magnetic fields below @xmath54 tesla within this method requires to increase the number of landau levels in our base states , making the numeric computation excessively time consuming .",
