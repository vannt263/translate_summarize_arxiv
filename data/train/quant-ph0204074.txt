    "another method which we believe to be neater and just as accurate is proposed here by using a slightly more sophisticated method similar to that in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the basis of the approach is to move into an interaction picture with respect to@xmath58 this approach may seem counter - intuitive to most . usually when moving to an interaction picture , it would be with respect to a @xmath59 that is already one of the terms in the hamiltonian . in our case , if we investigate eq .",
    "( [ adiab1me ] ) , we are moving to an interaction picture with respect to the opposite of a term in the effective hamiltonian and as such will actually be adding a term to the hamiltonian .",
    "the reason we choose to do this is that the problem term we encountered in sec .",
    "[ standard ] was in the hamiltonian for the excited state .",
    "the potential seen by the excited state of the atom is in fact inverted and so the chosen @xmath59 is designed to cancel the excited state potential .    after moving into this interaction picture",
    ", we then perform the adiabatic elimination process , and finally transform back into the schrdinger picture .",
    "this method can give a different result because the approximations we make in the interaction picture may not have been valid in the schrdinger picture .    with the unitary transformation operator @xmath60 , the interaction picture density matrix is @xmath61 using this in eqs .",

    "( [ adiab2me ] ) .",
    "the dressed state master equation results would thus lie exactly on top of those of the more sophisticated adiabatic approximation and as such are not included in the simulations .",
    "now that we have derived the forms of the master equations which we wish to compare , we need to set up a method of simulation for the different approximations and the full master equation . in this case , the numerical environment matlab turned out to be the most useful tool , combined with the quantum optics toolbox produced by s.m .",
    "tan @xcite .",
    "the simulation is designed by converting states and operators to vectors and matrices . making this conversion",
    "requires a number of different adaptations of the theoretical master equations .",
    "firstly , we need to chose a form for the complex rabi frequency operator , @xmath11 .",
    "the form of the rabi frequency operator we use here is @xmath136 , such that there is no time dependence ( standing wave ) and the operator is hermitian . rewriting the sine function in terms of exponentials , @xmath137 , we can examine the action of these exponentials .",
    "this suggests using the momentum representation , because the exponentials , @xmath138 , simply represent single momentum kicks to the atom of @xmath139 , or @xmath140 atomic unit of momentum .",
    "having chosen to use the momentum representation to evaluate our master equation solutions , we need to address concerns with the conversion process .",
    "firstly , the momentum range must be truncated .",
    "the loss of probability due to this truncation should be kept below some small level , say @xmath141 . using this rule of thumb",
    ", it was found that a momentum hilbert space ranging from @xmath142 up to @xmath143 was sufficient for the parameters we chose ( discussed later ) .",
    "we still face a limitation problem in that the momentum hilbert space is continuous . to simulate this on a computer , we need to discretize this space .",
    "we are able to discretize this space , again as a consequence of the choice of @xmath11 .",
    "the exponential component nature of @xmath11 provides for momentum kicks of exactly one atomic unit of momentum in the direction of propagation of the laser light ( the @xmath5-direction ) .",
    "thus the only momentum kicks that are not in a single unit of atomic momentum in the @xmath5-direction are due to spontaneous emission of photons from the atom .",
    "this allows for a momentum kick of one atomic unit in any direction , which , when projected onto the @xmath5-direction , allows for a random kick of anywhere between @xmath144 and @xmath145 atomic unit .",
    "however the relative infrequency of the spontaneous emission allows us to approximate this by a kick of @xmath144 , @xmath146 , or @xmath145 .",
    "this approximation requires us to convert the integral over the atomic dipole distribution to a discrete sum . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we let @xmath147 where the discrete function @xmath148 is obtained by making sure that it has the same normalization , mean momentum kick and mean squared momentum kick .",
    "this gives @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we now need to define our matrix notation .",
    "the simulations here will set @xmath14 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 to 1 so that the kinetic energy operator can be represented as @xmath152 where @xmath153 denotes a momentum eigenstate .",
    "the @xmath154 operator in a momentum hilbert space just acts as a raising operator given by @xmath155 the @xmath156 operator is just the lowering operator @xmath157 . for simplicity , we take the initial density matrix to be the zero momentum state @xmath158 , given by a @xmath159 matrix of zeros with a 1 in the very centre .",
    "these are all the approximations required to allow the simulation of the adiabatic approximations .",
    "the full master equation and the secular and dressed - state approximations require the internal state information as well .",
    "this is achieved by constructing the tensor product of the @xmath159 momentum hilbert with a @xmath160 internal state hilbert space .",
    "this is easily done using the quantum optics toolbox .",
    "the only problem remaining is to adopt a method of simulation .",
    "there are a number of different simulation methods available as part of the quantum optics toolbox as well as any number of methods available using regular ordinary differential equation techniques .",
    "the method we use here is a built - in function of the quantum optics toolbox called odesolve .",
    "this allows options to be specified for use on both smooth and stiff ode problems .",
    "the simulations presented here using odesolve were checked using first , a hybrid euler and matrix exponential method , and second , a modified mid - point method combined with richardson extrapolation from press _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the results all agreed well but the odesolve method was by far the fastest and easiest to use .",
    "we wish to simulate the experimental regime of hensinger _",
    "et al _ , where @xmath161 . however , the actual experimental parameters would be prohibitively time - consuming to simulate .",
    "this is both because of the separation in time scales between the fastest ( @xmath6 ) and slowest dynamics ( @xmath162 ) , and also because of the basis size required .",
    "the latter is determined by the fact that @xmath163 must be larger than the effective potential drop , @xmath164 .",
    "if we were to use the parameters of the experiment of @xcite then we would need a basis size of more than @xmath165 . however , we can scale the parameters down and still preserve the regime of the experiments .    as well as working in the regime @xmath161 , we require for the validity of the adiabatic approximations that @xmath24 be much larger than the oscillation frequency near the potential minimum , @xmath166 . in our scaled units ( @xmath167 ) ,",
    "the latter is of order @xmath168 . on this basis , we have chosen paramaters of @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , leaving @xmath172 , giving @xmath173 . for rb as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have @xmath174 nm and @xmath175 kg , so in si units , the frequency unit is @xmath176 s@xmath177 .",
    "note that the @xmath24 we have chosen is _ not _ the true radiative decay rate for rb .",
    "the scaled time unit can be given meaning by examining the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "for each of the approximations , the fluorescence rate is ( to leading order ) @xmath178 . here",
    "@xmath179 is a time - averaged effective value , which would be somewhat less than @xmath180 .",
    "this means that after a time period of @xmath181 , we would expect there to have somewhat under one spontaneous emission .",
    "this time is 2 scaled time units .",
    "there is , however , a lot of evolution occurring in that time period . to compare the approximations , we look in detail at a period from 0 to 2 time units , and",
    "also look at the long time results at 8 time units .",
    "in comparing the results of the simulations , we first compare the accuracy of the approximations , and then the resources required to perform the calculations .      to compare the accuracy of the simulations , we look at the momentum distribution of the atom as it evolves through time . the interesting components of this evolution are the probability to have 0 momentum and the probability to have 1 atomic unit of momentum as the atom evolves through time .",
    "the other probabilities evolve similarly to one of these two .",
    "firstly , we will look at the probability to have zero momentum over a relatively short timescale .",
    "the approximations are so close to the full master equation that , at full size , they are almost impossible to distinguish from the full master equation . fig .",
    "[ full0]a shows an overall picture of how the probability to have zero momentum evolves through time .",
    "[ full0]b zooms in on a section of the full size figure to illustrate the differences between the approximations .",
    "as we can see , the secular and standard adiabatic approximation evolutions both significantly lead that of the full master equation in time .",
    "the dressed - state and sophisticated adiabatic approximations are very close to the full master equation solution even at this magnification .",
    "fig [ full0]c zooms in even closer to try to distinguish the sophisticated adiabatic approximation from the full master equation .",
    "this trend continues as we investigate the probability to have 1 atomic unit of momentum in fig .",
    "[ full1 ] .",
    "the inaccuracy of the secular and standard adiabatic approximations are again evident in fig .",
    "[ full1]b .",
    "the more sophisticated adiabatic approximation is very close to the full master equation evolution and is still indistinguishable at this magnification .",
    "[ full1]c provides a means of comparing the sophisticated adiabatic approximation to the full master equation evolution in detail .",
    "as we can see , the more sophisticated adiabatic approximation is again very close to the full master equation .",
    "the last visual comparison to make is to see how the evolution described by the approximations matches that of the full master equation after a very long time period .",
    "the time period that has elapsed in fig . [ long ]",
    "is 8 time units , after which , we would have expected there to be a number of spontaneous emissions . at this point in time",
    ", we compare the probability densities described by the approximations and the full master equation .",
    "it is evident from fig . [ long ]",
    "that the standard adiabatic and the secular approximations are quite poor methods for simulating the full master equation evolution over a long time period .",
    "the main reason for this is the leading behaviour such as we see in fig .",
    "[ full0]a .",
    "even at long times , the probability to have zero momentum is still oscillating and the leading behaviour means that the standard adiabatic and secular approximations are not oscillating in phase with the full master equation .",
    "thus , even though they follow roughly the same shape , they are not necessarily at the same point in the oscillation as the full master equation .",
    "what is even more striking though is that the secular approximation evolution seems to follow a slightly different trend for the probabilities to have larger momentum .",
    "the intriguing features of the secular approximation are discussed in sec [ discussion ] .    to examine how close the sophisticated adiabatic and the dressed - state approximations are to the full master equation , fig .",
    "[ longzoom ] focuses on a smaller section to provide a comparison .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ longzoom ] that the dressed - state and sophisticated adiabatic approximations are very close to the full master equation , even at this long time .",
    "the main resource required to perform the simulations is time .",
    "although each approximation has different memory and processing power requirements , these needs are reasonably accurately reflected in the time each simulation takes to run . the times quoted in table [ table ]",
    "are the times required to calculate the set of results from 0 to 8 time units and are quoted in seconds .",
    ".[table]comparison of the times each simulation requires to run . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we can see from the results in table [ table ] , the adiabatic approximations are both clearly the fastest .",
    "the secular approximation is just over 4 times larger than the adiabatic approximations .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected .",
    "we would have expected at least a doubling in time by using the methods that included state information .",
    "the secular approximation is supposed to force the coherences to zero .",
    "unfortunately , using our method to simulate this allows zero to be anywhere up to @xmath141 .",
    "this , although small , still has to be processed explaining the four - fold increase in time .",
    "one reason it is just over 4 times the time required for the adiabatic approximations could be that after the evolution has been calculated , there is still a partial trace to be performed to obtain a solution of the same form as the adiabatic approximations .",
    "we could have limited this time by simulating two coupled equations instead of a full master equation and then would probably have only doubled the time taken .",
    "the standard and more sophisticated adiabatic approximations take similar times to simulate , and are much faster than the full master equation .",
    "the only difference between them is an extra potential term .",
    "it turns out , though , that this hamiltonian term is quite important in accurately describing the motion of the atom . while the standard approach evolves too quickly and leads that of the full master equation evolution , the more sophisticated approach with the modified potential does not suffer this problem .",
    "the evolution described by this more sophisticated approach is very close to the full master equation , even at long times .",
    "of course the dressed - state approximation offers the same accuracy as the sophisticated adiabatic approximation which may be useful if we wanted to simulate an initially excited atom .",
    "these successes contrast the results from the secular approximation .",
    "as one can see from figs .",
    "[ full0 ]  and  [ full1 ] , the secular approximation not only leads the full master equation solution but it also predicts a lower probability to have either zero or one atomic unit of momentum .",
    "this result is surprising because the secular approximation master equation is quite similar to the others . investigating this further , we find that the secular approximation master equation simulation shows that the probability to have 25 atomic units of momentum increases exponentially much faster than any of the other approximations .",
    "to analyse this in another manner , we find that for the secular approximation tr@xmath182 $ ] falls off from 1 exponentially much faster than any of the other approximations or the full master equation .    if we consider the dressed - state approximation master equation , eq .",
    "( [ finaldressme ] ) , we notice that the hamiltonian terms are , to leading order , the same as the final secular approximation master equation eq .",
    "( [ secularme ] ) .",
    "the only advantage the dressed state approximation has in terms of it s hamiltonian is the presence of the higher order term .",
    "the leading order lindbladian terms are also identical with only the higher order terms differing .",
    "the dressed - state master equation includes lindbladian terms which give rise to a momentum kick to the atom ( from the @xmath15 superoperator ) without a change in the internal state of the atom .",
    "the higher order secular approximation master equation lindbladian term provides the opposite .",
    "here there is an internal state change without a momentum kick to the atom .",
    "thus it is quite unexpected that the secular approximation solution should differ so greatly from the dressed - state approximation solution as they are identical in the leading order terms .",
    "it is a fairly simple matter to investigate the effect of the differences between the two approximations by simulating only parts of the master equations .",
    "if we only included the hamiltonian terms from each master equation , the difference would only be the higher order term in the dressed state master equation .",
    "this term has the same effect here as it does for the sophisticated adiabatic approximation , correcting the leading behaviour .",
    "it does not however account for the secular approximation predicting lower probabilities as it does in figs .",
    "[ full0 ] and [ full1 ] .",
    "thus to investigate the difference between the higher order lindbladian terms , we drop the @xmath15 superoperator from the dressed - state master equation and add it to the secular approximation master equation .",
    "this does not correct the problems with the secular approximation nor does it severely affect the dressed - state approximation . this only leaves the inherent difference that the dressed - state master equation provides a correction term without requiring a state change where the secular approximation forces a state change in it s correction term .",
    "thus we have to conclude that the best approximation to the full master equation involves a lindbladian term that does not change the internal state of the atom . lacking it ,",
    "the secular approximation is the poorest .",
    "one other point to note in this discussion is one of the conditions on which the adiabatic elimination techniques are based .",
    "this is that @xmath183 be much larger than @xmath184 .",
    "this will be satisfied if @xmath185 / \\gamma\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\rho_{ee}\\right]\\ll 1 .",
