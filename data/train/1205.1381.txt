    ", analytical models of articular contact assume rigid bones and represent cartilage as a thin elastic layer of constant thickness resisting to deformation like a winkler foundation consisting of a series of discrete springs with constant length and stiffness @xcite .",
    "however , a subject - specific approach to articular contact mechanics requires developing patient - specific models for accurate predictions .",
    "recently , a sensitivity analysis of finite element models of hip cartilage mechanics with respect to varying degrees of simplified geometry was performed in @xcite .",
    "based on the asymptotic analysis of the frictionless contact problem for a thin elastic layer bonded to a rigid substrate in the thin - layer limit @xcite , the following asymptotic model for contact interaction of two thin incompressible layers was established @xcite : @xmath0 @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the contact pressure density , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the thickness and elastic modulus of the layer material , respectively , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the laplace differential operator , @xmath7 is the vertical approach of the rigid substrates , @xmath8 is the gap function defined as the distance between the layer surfaces in the vertical direction , @xmath9 is the contact area , @xmath10 is the contour of @xmath9 , @xmath11 is the normal derivative .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the problem ( [ 0v(1.1 ) ] ) , ( [ 0v(1.2 ) ] ) describes the instantaneous response of thin biphasic layers to dynamic and impact loading . in @xcite , the elastic model ( [ 0v(1.1 ) ] ) , ( [ 0v(1.2 ) ] ) was generalized for the general viscoelastic case .",
    "with respect to articular contact , a special interest represents the case when the subchondral bones are shaped as an elliptic paraboloid @xmath12 with positive curvature radii @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in the case ( [ 0v(1.3 ) ] ) , the exact solution to the problem ( [ 0v(1.1 ) ] ) , ( [ 0v(1.2 ) ] ) has the following form @xcite : @xmath15 integration of the pressure distribution ( [ 0v(1.4 ) ] ) over the elliptical contact region @xmath9 with the semi - axes @xmath16 and @xmath17 results in the following force - displacement relationship @xcite : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is a dimensionless factor depending on the aspect ratio @xmath20 , and the coefficient @xmath21 is given by @xmath22    the asymptotic model ( [ 0v(1.1)])([0v(1.3 ) ] ) assumes that the cartilage layers have constant thicknesses , whereas it is well known @xcite that articular cartilage has a variable thickness as well as the surface of subchondral bone deviates from the ellipsoid shape @xcite .",
    "a sensitivity of the model ( [ 0v(1.1 ) ] ) , ( [ 0v(1.2 ) ] ) with respect to small perturbations of the gap function ( [ 0v(1.3 ) ] ) was performed in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "it was shown @xcite that the influence of the gap function variation on the force - displacement relationship will be negligible if the effective geometrical characteristics @xmath13 and @xmath14 are determined by a least square method .    to our knowledge , in the literature there is only one study @xcite where the 2d case of contact problem for a thin elastic strip of variable thickness was solved by an asymptotic method under the assumption that poisson s ratio of the strip material is not very close to @xmath23 .",
    "at the same time , many asymptotic solutions were derived for an elastic layer of constant thickness both in the axisymmetric @xcite and the non - axisymmetric @xcite cases .    in the present paper , a three - dimensional unilateral contact problem for a thin elastic layer of variable thickness bonded to a rigid substrate is considered .",
    "two cases are studied separately : ( a ) poisson s ratio of the layer material is not very close to @xmath23 ; ( b ) the layer material is incompressible with poisson s ratio of @xmath23 . after developing a refined asymptotic model , we apply sensitivity analysis to determine how `` sensitive '' is the mathematical model ( [ 0v(1.1 ) ] ) , ( [ 0v(1.2 ) ] ) to variations in the values of the layer thicknesses .",
    "to be more precise we consider the term `` sensitivity '' in a broad sense by allowing variable layer thicknesses , whereas the original model deals with scalar parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "the problem is to calculate the contact pressure distribution @xmath56    an important characteristic of the problem is the contact force required to indent the layer @xmath57    finally , let us introduce the notation @xmath58 where @xmath59    thus , the following relation takes place : @xmath60 here , @xmath61 is an average thickness , @xmath62 is a small variation such that @xmath63 ( see figure  [ figure_strip.pdf ] ) .",

    "<S> in the framework of the recently developed asymptotic models for tibio - femoral contact incorporating frictionless elliptical contact interaction between thin elastic , viscoelastic , or biphasic cartilage layers , we apply an asymptotic modeling approach for analytical evaluating the sensitivity of crucial parameters in joint contact mechanics due to small variations in the thicknesses of the contacting cartilage layers . </S>",
    "<S> the four term asymptotic expansion for the normal displacement at the contact surface is explicitly derived , which recovers the corresponding solution obtained previously for the 2d case in the compressible case . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that to minimize the influence of the cartilage thickness non - uniformity on the force - displacement relationship , the effective thicknesses of articular layers should be determined from a special optimization criterion .    </S>",
