    "it is physically self - consistent , and convincingly rationalizes observational facts .",
    "it accounts for the general location of the instability strip , although a precise specification depends upon the modeling of convection ( e.g. , the mixing - length parameter ) .",
    "convective driving also explains why longer period modes become overstable as a star cools ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : na - vis - l1mode - new ] ) .",
    "although we agree with brickhill that @xmath10 is a necessary condition for mode overstability , we find that it is not a sufficient condition for modes whose periods exceed @xmath183 .",
    "this stems from enhanced radiative damping of modes whose upper cavity lids approach @xmath18 , as is apparent from both quasiadiabatic and nonadiabatic calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : na - vis - jumpglobal ] ) .",
    "our nonadiabatic calculations yield a maximum period of about @xmath184 for overstable modes .",
    "this clashes with the maximum period of @xmath6 for observationally detected modes .",
    "we also agree with brickhill s deduction ( @xcite ) that turbulent convection forces the horizontal velocity to be nearly independent of depth within the convective envelope .",
    "consequently , mode damping due to turbulent dissipation within the convection zone is reduced to a negligible level",
    ". however , suppression of the horizontal shear in the convective envelope results in a shear layer at the top of the radiative interior .",
    "when convective overshoot is accounted for , this provides linear turbulent damping .",
    "figure [ fig : na - vis - l1mode - new ] suggests that turbulent dissipation might depress the maximum period of observable modes to some degree .",
    "convective overshoot also alters the thermal structure of the upper radiative layer .",
    "a rough treatment of this effect with one scale height of overshoot predicts a maximum period of @xmath185 for overstable modes .",
    "nonlinear interactions which limit the amplitudes of overstable modes may also play a part in determining the maximum period .    in conclusion",
    ", the blue edge of the theoretical instability strip seems to be set by the condition that @xmath186 for the lowest order @xmath0 mode .",
    "but the location of the red edge is more nebulous , and may result from a combination of decreased photometric visibility , convective overshoot , and nonlinear effects .",
    "additional detections of velocity variations associated with g - modes could provide important clues .",
    "convective driving makes the testable prediction that velocity variations become relatively more observable than photometric variations toward the red edge of the instability strip .",
