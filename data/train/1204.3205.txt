    "virtual knot theory has been introduced by kauffman @xcite as a generalization of classical knot theory .",

    "* theorem 1b ) states that if two classical knot diagrams are equivalent under generalized reidemeister moves , then they are equivalent under the classical reidemeister moves . in this sense",
    "virtual link theory is a nontrivial extension of classical theory .",
    "this theorem is a straightforward consequence of the fact that the knot group ( more precisely the _ group system _ of a knot , see for instance @xcite ) is a complete knot invariant which can be naturally extended in the realm of virtual links .",
    "nevertheless this notion of invariant does not appear satisfactory for virtual objects ( see section  [ gvl ] ) : the main goal of this paper is to explore new invariants for virtual links using braids and their virtual generalizations .",
    "in fact , using virtual generalized reidemeister moves we can introduce a notion of `` virtual '' braids ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "virtual braids on @xmath0 strands form a group , usually denoted by @xmath1 . the relations between virtual braids and virtual knots ( and links )",
    "are completely determined by a generalization of alexander and markov theorems  @xcite .    to the generalized reidemeister moves on virtual diagrams one could add the following local moves , called _ forbidden moves _ of type @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( figure [ reidforb ] ) :     ( on the left ) and type @xmath3 ( on the right),width=453 ]    we can include one or both of them to obtain a `` quotient '' theory of the theory of virtual links .",
    "if we allow the move @xmath2 , then we obtain the theory of _ welded links _ whose interest is growing up recently , in particular because of the fact that the welded braid counterpart can be defined in several equivalent ways ( for instance in terms of configuration spaces , mapping classes and automorphisms of free groups ) . the theory with both forbidden moves added",
    "is called the theory of _ fused links _ but this theory is trivial , at least at the level of knots , since any knot is equivalent to the trivial knot @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections  [ intro ] and  [ gl ] we recall some definitions and classical results and we construct a representation of @xmath1 into @xmath4 ; using this representation we define ( section  [ gvl ] ) a new notion of group of a virtual knot ( or link ) and we compare our invariant to other known invariants . in the case of welded objects ( section  [ gwl ] )",
    "our construction gives an invariant which is a straightforward generalization to welded knots of kauffman notion of group of virtual knots .",
    "we conclude with some observations on the analogous of wada groups in the realm of welded links",

    "during last twenty years several generalizations of braid groups were defined and studied , according to their definition as `` diagrams '' in the plane : in particular singular braids @xcite , virtual braids @xcite and welded braids @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that for all of these generalizations it exists an alexander - like theorem , stating that any singular ( respectively virtual or welded ) link can be represented as the closure of a singular ( respectively virtual or welded ) braid .",
    "moreover , there are generalizations of classical markov s theorem for braids giving a characterization for two singular ( respectively virtual or welded ) braids whose closures represent the same singular ( respectively virtual or welded ) link @xcite .    in the following",
    "we introduce virtual and welded braid groups as quotients of free product of braid groups and corresponding symmetric groups .",
    "virtual and welded braid groups have several other definitions , more intrinsic , see for instance @xcite for the virtual case and @xcite for the welded one .",
    "the braid group @xmath5 , @xmath6 , on @xmath0 strings can be defined as the group generated by @xmath7 , with the defining relations : @xmath8 @xmath9    the virtual braid group @xmath1 can be defined as the group generated by the elements @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 with the defining relations : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17    it is easy to verify that @xmath11 s generate the symmetric group @xmath18 and that the @xmath10 s generate the braid group @xmath5 ( see remark [ weldedvirtualembedding ] ) .    in @xcite it was proved that the relations @xmath19 corresponding to the forbidden moves f1 and f2 for virtual link diagram , are not fulfilled in @xmath1 .    according to @xcite the welded braid group @xmath20 is generated by @xmath10 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",

    "notice that if we add to relations of @xmath1 the relations related to @xmath3 moves : @xmath27 we get a group , @xmath28 , which is isomorphic to @xmath20 : this isomorphism is given by the map @xmath29 that sends @xmath11 in @xmath21 and @xmath10 in @xmath30 .",
    "as remarked by artin , the braid group @xmath5 may be represented as a subgroup of @xmath31 by associating to any generator @xmath10 , for @xmath32 , of @xmath5 the following automorphism of @xmath33 : @xmath34    artin proved a stronger result ( see for instance  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 5.1 ) ) , by giving a characterization of braids as automorphisms of free groups .",

    "we remark also that a quite tedious computation shows that image by @xmath46 of the _ kishino braid _ : @xmath69 is non trivial while its alexander invariant is trivial @xcite .",

    "one can consider the oriented diagram of the link as the union of oriented arcs in the plane .",

    "the second claim of the proposition follows easily from the fact that any generator of type @xmath247 is a conjugated of @xmath300 where @xmath38 is of order @xmath0 .",
    "therefore in the abelianization all generators of type @xmath247 have the same image .    from propositions [ isomprincipal ] and [ isomweld ]",
    "therefore it follows that :    let @xmath284 be a diagram as above",
    ". then @xmath301 .",
    "in @xcite wada found several representations of @xmath5 in @xmath31 which , by the usual braid closure , provide group invariants of links .",
    "these representation are of the following special form : any generator ( and therefore its inverse ) of @xmath5 acts trivially on generators of @xmath33 except a pair of generators :        where @xmath304 and @xmath305 are now words in the generators @xmath306 , with @xmath307 . in @xcite wada found four families of representations providing group invariants of links ( they are types @xmath308 in wada s paper ) :      as in the case of artin representation we can ask if these representations extend to welded braids providing group invariants for welded links . more precisely ,",
    "let @xmath316 ( for @xmath317 ) be the set map from the set of generators @xmath318 of @xmath20 to @xmath31 which associates to any generators @xmath10 the wada representation of type @xmath319 and to any generators @xmath21 the usual automorphism @xmath320            one can repeat almost verbatim the arguments from @xcite for classical braids . notice that @xmath327 is the group of co - invariants of @xmath264 , i.e. the maximal quotient of @xmath33 on which @xmath328 acts trivially .",
    "since the group of co - invariants is invariant up to conjugation by an automorphism , we deduce that conjugated welded braids have isomorphic wada groups . to prove the statement it is therefore sufficient to verify that @xmath329 and @xmath330 are isomorphic : this a straightforward computation similar to the case 3 ) in theorem [ theorem4 ] , the key point being that @xmath331 for @xmath322 ( see also section 2 of @xcite ) .    in @xcite wada representations of type @xmath332",
    "have been extended to group invariants for virtual links using a wirtinger like presentation of virtual link diagrams : contrarily to the classical case these groups are not necessarily isomorphic",
    ".    analogously it would be interesting to understand the geometrical meaning of wada groups of welded links . in this perspective , proposition [ equiv ] shows that wada representations of type @xmath333 and @xmath334 are not equivalent .",
    "the proof is the same as in proposition a.1 of @xcite : the claim follows from considering the induced action on @xmath341 . under wada representations of type @xmath333 a welded braid has evidently finite order as automorphism of @xmath341 while we have that @xmath342=(t+1)[x_i ] -t[x_2]$ ] for all @xmath343 , where @xmath344 $ ] denote the equivalence class in @xmath341 of an element @xmath345 .",
