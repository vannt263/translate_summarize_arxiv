    "deuterium is created in an astrophysically interesting abundance only during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite , after which , in the post - bbn universe , its abundance ( @xmath7 ) decreases monotonically due to the processing of gas through succeeding generations of stars where deuterium is completely destroyed @xcite .",
    "consequently , deuterium plays a special role in cosmology , nuclear astrophysics , and in galactic chemical evolution @xcite .",
    "its relatively simple galactic evolution permits us to use deuterium to determine the fraction of interstellar gas that has been processed through stars @xcite . by comparing the primordial and galactic deuterium abundances one can learn about and discriminate among different galactic chemical evolution models @xcite .",
    "together with non - bbn constraints on the baryon ( nucleon ) density from observations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the primordial deuterium abundance , , is predicted by bbn @xcite .",
    "the predicted abundance is in excellent agreement with observations of deuterium in high - redshift , low - metallicity qso absorption line systems ( qsoals ) @xcite .",
    "since deuterium is destroyed in the galaxy as gas is cycled through stars , ( d / h)@xmath8 ( d / h)@xmath9",
    ". however , all successful chemical evolution models require infall to the disk of the galaxy of unprocessed ( or , nearly unprocessed ) gas @xcite , and such deuterium - rich ( and metal - poor ) gas would raise the ism d / h ratio closer to the primordial value . as a result ,",
    "comparison of the primordial and ism deuterium abundances provides a constraint on infall and , therefore , on chemical evolution models .",
    "observations over the past decade and more of the deuterium abundance in the relatively local interstellar medium ( ism ) reveal an unexpectedly large scatter in d / h @xcite , challenging the conventional wisdom of a well mixed ism . for example , as shown in figure  [ fig : lgyvslgh ] , the absorption line measurements from the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) reveal variations of a factor of @xmath10 ( @xmath11(d / h)@xmath12 ) in the _ gas - phase _",
    "d / h ratios over lines of sight ( los ) to background stars within @xmath1 kpc of the sun . moreover , the variations in the observed , gas phase d / h abundances are found to correlate _",
    "positively _ with the abundances of refractory elements such as ti @xcite , and a similar correlation is also found between d and other metals such as fe and o @xcite . however , this positive correlation between the abundances of d and the metals is opposite to the trend expected from stellar nucleosynthesis ( d decreasing as the metals increase ) .",
    "motivated by the observed correlations and by the very large spread in the d / h ratios inferred from the fuse and other data sets , it has been proposed that the large variations in _ gas - phase _",
    "d / h may be due to the depletion of gas phase deuterium onto dust grains @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then the fuse ( and other ) gas - phase absorption - line measurements reveal that depletion has not been well mixed ( homogenized ) in the ism and , the data may only provide a _",
    "lower _ limit to the _ true _ ( undepleted )",
    "ism deuterium abundance and , therefore , only an _",
    "upper _ limit to the deuterium astration factor , @xmath13 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lgyvslgh ] the logs of the deuterium abundances ( log  @xmath14logn ( ) @xmath15 logn ( ) ) are shown as a function of the logs of the  column densities for the 49 los with  column densities from table 2 of @xcite , supplemented by data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of these 49 los , 41 have iron abundance measurements ( filled symbols ) ; 21 of the 49 los are within the local bubble ( lb ; see @xcite for a discussion of the lb ) ; the remaining 28 non - local bubble ( nlb ) los are toward stars beyond the lb ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "the unexpectedly large spread among the observationally inferred ism d abundances complicates any estimate of . recognizing this point , @xcite chose for their estimate of a _ lower bound _ to the true ( undepleted ) ism deuterium abundance the mean of the five _ highest _ d / h ratios finding  @xmath16 or , when including corrections ( see the discussion in  2.1 ) for n ( ) and n ( ) for those lines of sight outside of the local bubble ,  @xmath17 .",
    "these estimates are quite close to the _ lower bound _ to the primordial abundance estimated from the qsoals , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , the wmap collaboration also provides an estimate of the effective number of neutrinos , @xcite which , when used along with their baryon density estimate in a bbn code , leads to a _",
    "different _ predicted primordial d abundance  @xmath19 .",
    "the difference between these two predictions reflects the difference between the standard model effective number of neutrinos expected and the wmap observed value , which is within @xmath20 of expectations .",

    "a very high infall rate of pristine material would be needed , challenging many galactic chemical evolution models @xcite . by limiting themselves to the five highest d abundances ,",
    "@xcite ignore the lower deuterium abundances along many more los which are consistent with them within the errors , potentially biasing their estimates of  and of @xmath23 .    in an attempt to address this issue , @xcite ( srt ) ,",
    "used the 18 highest d / h ratios from the fuse data ( see table 3 of @xcite ) , finding an ism d abundance of @xmath24 , corresponding to a d - astration factor @xmath25 , consistent with at least some of the otherwise successful chemical evolution models discussed in srt .",
    "in fact , the data in table 2 of @xcite reveal that there are 19 los with central values of log  @xmath26 .",
    "the weighted mean ( along with the error in the mean ) for these 19 d abundances is log @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "for these 19 los the reduced @xmath29 , confirms that the weighted mean provides a good description of their d abundances . as more los with lower d abundances",
    "are added , the weighted mean decreases , but the reduced @xmath30 increases , so that  @xmath31 is likely a robust _ lower _ bound to the ism d abundance and , @xmath32 ( log @xmath33 ) is a robust _ upper _ bound to the deuterium astration factor .    surely , there must be a better way to find a reliable estimate of the maximum value of the deuterium abundance in the local ism while accounting for the observational errors in the individual d abundance determinations . in ",
    "2 we describe a bayesian analysis designed to find the best estimate of the maximum , gas phase ( undepleted ) , ism deuterium abundance , , from data with non - negligible errors and we apply it to the fuse data set . on the assumption that the spread in the observed d abundances is the result of incompletely homogenized dust depletion ,  @xmath34  and @xmath35 .",
    "our results are summarized and our conclusions presented in  3 . as already noted , the dust depletion hypothesis suggests that there should be a correlation between the d and fe abundances .",
    "although this trend appears to be present at some level @xcite , a deeper analysis suggests that the simplest interpretation of the depletion hypothesis may need to be modified  @xcite .",
    "for example , since d is likely attached to the mantles of dust grains @xcite , while fe is mostly contained in the cores of the grains , d will be removed from grains more easily than fe .",
    "thus , although strong shocks may destroy grains completely , weak shocks may only remove d from grains while fe might stay locked within their cores @xcite .",
    "this effect then may explain the scatter observed in the relation between the d and fe depletions .",
    "thus , in a follow - up paper in preparation , the consistency of the depletion hypothesis with the fuse data for d and fe ( and o ) is investigated , and some possible modifications to its simplest version are explored @xcite .",
    "to avoid imposing any prior prejudice on which los should be included and which excluded in our analysis or , on how the observed d abundances may , or may not correlate with iron ( or other metals ) , we adopt a statistical , model - independent method for determining the undepleted galactic deuterium abundance .",
    "our approach follows closely the model - independent bayesian analysis developed by @xcite to determine the primordial helium abundance .",
    "it is useful to recall the problem @xcite addressed and how they solved it .",
    "helium-4 is produced abundantly during bbn and in the post - bbn universe its abundance is enhanced by stellar produced he . as a result , the he mass fraction , y@xmath9 , is expected to increase from its primordial value , y@xmath9 , along with the metallicity , z. extrapolation of the observed y versus z relation to zero metallicity results in an estimate of y@xmath36 y@xmath9 . the problem for he is that the form of the y@xmath9 versus z relation is a priori unknown and , may even differ from object to object ( low metallicity , extragalactic  regions ) .",
    "this , in combination with the errors in the observed values of y@xmath9 and z , complicates the derivation of y@xmath9 from the data .",
    "the challenge confronting @xcite was to identify y@xmath37 .",
    "the bayesian approach they developed @xcite is described below .",
    "if , indeed , the observed spread in d abundances results from dust depletion , then their he problem is entirely analogous to the one we confront in using the d abundance data , with its errors , to infer the _ maximum _ , gas phase d abundance .    here , the fuse set of galactic ism deuterium observations is analyzed assuming only that there exists a  true \" , uniform , ism deuterium abundance whose _ gas phase _ value may have been reduced by the depletion of d onto dust grains , with the amount of depletion possibly varying from los to los .",
    "the a priori unknown distribution of depletions is characterized in terms of a bayesian probability distribution ( a  prior \" ) , and the data themselves are used to determine both the true ism abundance  =  or , a lower bound to it ,  @xmath34 , as well as a measure of the amount of depletion , the depletion parameter @xmath38 .",
    "no prior assumptions about which los may have been affected by dust depletion are imposed and the entire data set is analyzed in an unbiased , bayesian manner .",
    "in our analysis we use the fuse ism deuterium abundance data for 46 los from @xcite , together with three , more recent measurements towards hd41161 , hd53975 @xcite and rej1738 + 665 @xcite . of the 49 los with deuterium abundance measurements , 21 are within the lb ( see @xcite for a discussion of the lb ) ; the remaining 28 are nlb los , towards stars beyond the lb . while the star 31 com is more distant than all the lb stars , the los to it has a very low  column density and an average  volume density ( @xmath39)@xmath40n()/@xmath41 ) much smaller than for all lb los .",
    "according to @xcite and @xcite , the absorption feature toward 31 com is at a velocity which is inconsistent with the lb and this los likely lies within the hot , ionized , local bubble ( which may account for the  high `` d and fe abundances ) in the direction of the north galactic pole . for a contrary point of view , see @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the assignment in table 2 of @xcite , we include 31 com along with the nlb los ( see figure [ fig : lgyvslgh ] ) .",
    "however , this assignment has negligible impact on our quantitative results . @xcite",
    "also list d / h ratios for the nlb los _ corrected _ by them for assumed _ average _ foreground lb  and  absorption .",
    "if velocity information were available it could be used to separate foreground absorption in the lb from that due to gas lying beyond the lb . in the absence of such data ,",
    "@xcite _ assume _ that the lb extends to n()@xmath42 @xmath43 and multiply n()@xmath42 by an adopted average lb d / h ratio to find n()@xmath42 .",
    "these two average column densities are subtracted from the  and  column densities observed for the individual nlb los and the ratio of the corrected column densities is used to find corrected nlb d / h ratios .",
    "@xcite base their assumed lb  column density on the na observations of @xcite , who find tentative evidence for a lb ' ' wall \" of cold dense gas with n ( ) @xmath44 .",
    "this procedure can bias the  corrected \" nlb deuterium abundances .",
    "for example , it enhances the d abundances along those nlb los where the observed d abundance exceeds the adopted lb d abundance and decreases the d abundances for those los where the observed d abundance is less than the adopted lb value .",
    "the magnitude of the correction increases with the value of the  average ``  column density adopted .",
    "in fact , the observed lb  column and volume densities are distributed very inhomogeneously , varying by nearly a factor of 30 along different lb los .",
    "this results in a scatter plot for the column densities as a function of distance to the background star . even for the subset of the most distant lb stars with @xmath45  pc , n ( )",
    "varies by a factor of @xmath46 , @xmath47  n ( ) @xmath48 .",
    "the structure of the lb is very complex @xcite and the location of the lb ' ' wall \" varies from 65 - 150 pc .",
    "thus , the value for the lb  column density adopted by @xcite may be an _ overestimate _ , leading to an _ overestimate _ for their inferred value of , since a smaller choice for the average foreground lb  column density will result in a smaller correction to n ( ) and a lower estimate of . for these reasons , in our analysis",
    ", we use the uncorrected  and  column densities for all nlb los .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt as a working hypothesis that the large scatter in the observed , gas phase , ism deuterium abundances is a reflection of the preferential depletion of deuterium ( relative to hydrogen ) onto dust grains .",
    "therefore , it is assumed that in the ism deuterium has a total los column density n(d)@xmath49 = n(d)@xmath50 + n(d)@xmath51 , where the sum includes the observed , gas phase component , n(d)@xmath50 = n()@xmath52 , and an unobserved , dust - depleted component , n(d)@xmath51 . along any los , n(d)@xmath53 n(d)@xmath50 .",
    "the data suggest , and we assume , that hydrogen is negligibly depleted onto dust and that the fraction of h tied up in molecules in the diffuse ism probed by fuse is usually negligible ( when h@xmath54 is observed , its column density is included in the budget for gas phase hydrogen ) , so that n(h)@xmath55  n(h)@xmath50 .    on the assumption of a uniform d abundance ( gas plus dust ) in the local ism ,",
    "the dispersion among the observed gas phase d abundances , @xmath56 , reflects the observational errors in n ( ) and n ( ) , along with any spatial variations in d depletion . since deuterium may be depleted along all local ism los , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the maximum gas phase ( undepleted ) deuterium abundance , consistent with the observational errors , and  @xmath34  . within the local ism",

    ", we first considered two asymmetric distributions  a positive - bias prior favoring low depletion , and a negative - bias prior favoring large depletion , as well as two other priors  an m - shaped distribution favoring both low and high depletion , and a complementary , @xmath85-shaped distribution .",
    "using the fuse deuterium observations along all 49 los @xcite , we found the likelihoods in the \\{,@xmath65 } plane for the five choices of the bayesian priors ( see figures  [ fig : allallpriors ] and [ fig : lbnlballm ] ) .",
    "for all priors , the bayesian analysis of the full data set requires significant depletion ( @xmath105 at greater than 99.9% confidence ) . comparing the maximum likelihood values for the five different distributions , we find that the bimodal , m - shaped distribution provides the best fit to the observed data ( see table 1 ) .",
    "however , it is important to notice that the shapes of the priors require an additional assumption in our analysis , so that the m - shaped distribution is the most model - dependent .    in contrast , the top - hat prior is the least model - dependent , favoring all levels of depletion equally . given our ignorance of the detailed depletion mechanisms responsible for the observed scatter in the gas phase ism deuterium abundances , we prefer to adopt for our estimate of the undepleted , ism deuterium abundance , the result of the simplest , top - hat prior , whose maximum likelihood is similar to that of the best - fitting m - distribution , y_d , ism y_d , max = 2.0 0.1 = 2.0(1 0.05 ) this value is our best estimate of the true ism d abundance based on the available deuterium observations in the local ism and is independent of any model - dependent assumptions about galactic chemical evolution . combining our result with  = @xmath113 @xcite ( which , recall , provides a _ lower _ bound to the primordial abundance ) , yields a limit to the deuterium astration factor @xmath114 ( for the m - prior , @xmath115 ) , consistent with most , but not all , galactic chemical evolution models @xcite . if , on the other hand we compared this  value to the bbn + wmap inferred primordial d abundance ,  = @xmath116 @xcite ,  = @xmath117 @xcite or , the prediction inferred when including the wmap - determined effective number of neutrino species @xcite ,  = @xmath118 , the resulting deuterium astration factor would be somewhat lower in first two cases , @xmath119 , which is marginally problematic for some gce models .",
    "in contrast , for the @xcite value of , @xmath120 , which is entirely consistent with gce models .    as seen in figures  [ fig : lgyvslgh ]  [ fig : lbnlball ] , for the lb there is little scatter among the gas - phase d abundances .",
    "the small scatter is entirely consistent with the observational errors ( @xmath121 ) and all lb d abundances are consistent , within the errors , with  = @xmath122 .",
    "this suggests that for the local bubble ,  @xmath34  and , @xmath123 , consistent with all the successful chemical evolution models identified in srt .",
    "however , while the uniform lb d abundance suggests that d may be _ undepleted _ in the lb , for all los ,  @xmath124 , suggesting either that d is _ depleted uniformly _ in the lb or , that outside of the lb the gas phase deuterium abundance may have been _ enhanced _ along some los by the addition of nearly primordial gas which has recently fallen into the disk of the galaxy in the form of cloudlets which take some time to mix with the pre - existing gas in the ism . does  = 1.5 or  = 2.0 provide the best estimate of the lower bound to the ism d abundance ? if deuterium is depleted onto dust , why is there not a strong correlation between deuterium abundance and iron depletion @xcite and , which refractory element is then best to use as proxy for determining deuterium depletion onto dust ?",
    "these questions can not be answered by the analysis presented here . in a companion paper @xcite ,",
    "abundances of refractory elements are used in concert with the deuterium abundances in an attempt to resolve this question .",
