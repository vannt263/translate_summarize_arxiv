    "the theorem is known as arnold s principle or arnold s law , after the russian mathematician v. i. arnold .",
    "arnold s law was enunciated by m. v. berry  @xcite some years ago to codify arnold s efforts to correct inappropriate attributions that neglect russian mathematicians .",
    "berry also proposed berry s law , a far broader , self - referential theorem : `` nothing is ever discovered for the first time . ''",
    "@xcite if the zeroth theorem were known as fischer s law , it would be a clear example of arnold s principle .",
    "as it is , the zeroth theorem stands as an illustration of berry s law . + in each example i present the bare bones of the issue - the named effect , the generally recognized `` owner , '' the prior `` claimant '' , with dates .",
    "after briefly describing the protagonists origins and careers , i quote from the appropriate literature to establish the truth of the specific example .",
    "my first example is the lorentz condition that defines the lorentz gauge for the electromagnetic potentials @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the relation was specified by the dutch theoretical physicist hendrik antoon lorentz in 1904 in an encyclopedia article .",
    "@xcite in his notation the constraint reads : + @xmath5 or , in covariant form , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "eq.([lorentz ] ) or ( [ lorentzc ] ) is so famous and familiar that any citation of it will be to some textbook .",
    "if it is ever actually traced back to lorentz , the reference will likely the cited encyclopedia article or his book , _ theory of electrons _ ,",
    "@xcite published in 1909 .",
    "lorentz was not the first to point out eq.([lorentz ] ) .",
    "thirty - seven years earlier , in 1867 , the danish theorist ludvig valentin lorenz , writing about the identity of light with the electromagnetism of charges and currents ,  @xcite stated the constraint on his choice of potentials . his version of eq.([lorentz ] ) reads : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scalar potential and @xmath11 are the components of the vector potential .",
    "the strange factors of 2 and 4 appearing here and below have their origins in a since abandoned definition of the electric current in terms of moving charges .    in 1900 , in a festschrift volume marking the 25th anniversary of h. a. lorentz s doctorate , the prussian theorist emil johann wiechert described the introduction of the scalar and vector potentials into the maxwell equations in much the way it is done in textbooks today .",
    "@xcite he notes that the divergence of the vector potential is not constrained by the relation @xmath12 and imposes the condition , in his notation where the vector potential is @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the speed of light : @xmath15      ludvig valentin lorenz was born in 1829 in helsingr , denmark of german - huguenot extraction .",
    "after gymnasium , in 1846 he entered the polytechnic high school in copenhagen , which had been founded by rsted in the year of lorenz s birth .",
    "he graduated as a chemical engineer from the university of copenhagen in 1852 . with occasional teaching jobs ,",
    "lorenz pursued research in physics and in 1858 went to paris to work with lam among others .",
    "an examination essay on elastic waves resulted in a paper of 1861 , where retarded solutions of the wave equation were first published . on his return to copenhagen",
    ", he published on optics ( 1863 ) and the identity of light with electromagnetism already mentioned . in 1866",
    "he was appointed to the faculty of the military high school outside copenhagen and also elected a member of the royal danish academy of sciences and letters .",
    "after 21 years at the military high school , lorenz obtained the support of the carlsberg foundation from 1887 until his death in 1891 . in 1890 his last paper ( only in danish ) was a detailed treatment on the scattering of radiation by spheres , anticipating what is known as `` mie scattering '' ( 1908 ) , another example of the zeroth theorem , not included here .",
    "emil johann wiechert was born in tilsit , prussia . when he was 18 he and his widowed mother moved to knigsberg where he attended first a gymnasium and then the albertus university .",
    "he completed his ph.d . on elastic waves in 1889 and began as a lecturer and researcher in knigsberg in 1890 .",
    "his research , both experimental and theoretical , encompassed electromagnetism , cathode rays , and electron theory , as well as geophysical topics such as the mass distribution within the earth . in 1897 he was invited to gttingen , first as _ prizatdozent _ and then in 1898 made professor and director of the gttingen geophysical institute , the first of its kind .",
    "wiechert remained at gttingen for the rest of his career , training students and working in geophysics and seismology , with occasional forays into theoretical physics topic such as relativity , and electron theory .",
    "he found his colleagues , felix klein , david hilbert , and his former mentor woldemar voigt , congenial and stimulating enough to turn down numerous offers of professorships elsewhere . in physics",
    "wiechert s name is famous for the linard - wiechert potentials of a relativistic charged particle ; in geophysics , for the wiechert inverted - pendulum seismograph .",
    "hendrik antoon lorentz was born in arnhem , the netherlands , in 1853 .",
    "after high school in arnhem , 1866 - 69 , he attended the university of leiden where he studied physics and mathematics , graduating in 1872 .",
    "he received his ph.d . in 1875 for a thesis on aspects on the electromagnetic theory of light .",
    "his academic career began in 1878 when at the age of 24 lorentz was appointed professor of theoretical physics at leiden , a post he held for 34 years .",
    "his research ranged widely , but centered on electromagnetism and light .",
    "his name is associated with lorenz in the lorenz - lorentz relation between the index of refraction of a medium and its density and composition ( lorenz , 1875 ; lorentz , 1878 ) .",
    "notable were his works in the 1890s on the electron theory of electromagnetism ( now called the microscopic theory , with charged particles at rest and in motion as the sources of the fields ) and the beginnings of relativity ( the fitzgerald - lorentz length contraction hypothesis , 1895 ) and a bit later the lorentz transformation .",
    "lorentz shared the 1902 nobel prize in physics with pieter zeeman for `` their researches into the influence of magnetism upon radiation phenomena . ''",
    "he received many honors and memberships in learned academies and was prominent in national and international scientific organizations until his death in 1928 .",
    "+    [ h ]       lorenz s 1867 paper  @xcite establishing the identity of light with electromagnetism was evidently written without knowledge of maxwell s famous work of 1865 .",
    "he begins with the quasi - static potentials , with the vector potential in the kirchhoff - weber form ,  @xcite and proceeds toward the differential equations for the fields . actually , following the continental approach of helmholtz , lorenz uses electric current density instead of electric field , noting the connection via ohm s law and the conductivity ( called _ k _ ) .",
    "but before proceeding to his full theory , lorenz establishes that his generalization of the quasi - static limit is consistent with all known observations to date . using a retarded form of the scalar potential , he demonstrates by expanding the retarded time @xmath16 in powers of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a velocity parameter , that his retarded scalar potential and an emergent retarded vector potential yield the same electric field as the instantaneous kirchhoff - weber forms to second order in the presumably small @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , by clever choices of the velocity @xmath18 , he is able to show a restricted class of what are now called gauge transformations involving the neumann and kirchhoff - weber forms of the vector potential , although he does not emphasize the point .",
    "because he is including light within his framework , he is not content with the quasi - static approximation",
    ". he proceeds to define the current density ( electric field ) components as @xmath19 , write a retarded form for the scalar potential , called @xmath10 , and then present the ( almost ) familiar expressions for the current density / electric field in terms of the scalar and vector potential :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` hence the equations for the propagation of electricity , as regards the experiments on which they rest , are just as valid as [ the quasi - static equations ] if [ ... ] the following form be assigned to them ,  @xcite @xmath20 where , for brevity s sake , we put @xmath21 these equations are distinguished from equations ( i ) [ the kirchhoff - weber forms ] by containing , instead of @xmath22 , the somewhat less complicated members @xmath23 ; and they express further that the entire action between free electricity and the electric currents _ requires time to propagate itself _",

    "was concerned about atomic physics ; his focus was on the `` thomas factor '' in the comparison of the fine structure and the anomalous zeeman effect in hydrogen .",
    "bargmann , michel , and telegdi focused on relativistic spin motion and how electromagnetic fields changed transverse polarization into longitudinal polarization and vice versa , with application to the measurement of the muon s g - factor in a storage ring .",
    "but it was all in thomas s 1927 paper , 32 years earlier .",
    "these five examples from physics illustrate the different ways that inappropriate attributions are given for significant contributions to science .",
    "ludvig vladimir lorenz lost out to the homophonous dutchman ( and emil wiechert ) largely because he was in some sense before his time and was a dane who published an appreciable part of his work in danish only .",
    "he died in 1891 , just as lorentz was most productive in electromagnetic theory and applications . by 1900",
    "lorenz s name had virtually vanished from the literature . recently",
    "a move is underway ( in which the author is a participant ) to recognize lorenz for the `` lorentz '' condition and gauge ; h. a. lorentz has many other achievements attributed justly to him .",
    "+ in the physics literature the dirac delta function often goes without attribution , so common is its usage .",
    "but when a name is attached , it is dirac s , not heaviside s .",
    "the reason , i think , is that in the 1930 s and 1940 s dirac s book on quantum mechanics was a standard and extremely influential . with almost no references in the book",
    ", it is not surprising the dirac did not cite heaviside , even though , as an electrical engineer , he surely was aware of heaviside s operational calculus and his impulse function .",
    "those learning quantum mechanics then ( and now ) would be only dimly or not at all aware of who was oliver heaviside .",
    "scientists look forward , not back ; 35 or 40 years is a lifetime or two .",
    "i can hear the voices saying : if some electrical engineer used the same concept in the 19th century , so be it .",
    "but our delta function is dirac s .",
    "+ schumann resonances are a different case .",
    "for some years , now enhanced by the internet , a vocal minority have trumpeted tesla s discovery of the low - frequency electromagnetic resonances in the earth - ionosphere cavity .",
    "i believe that claim is incorrect , but tesla was a genius in many ways .",
    "it is not surprising that his discussion of resonances around the earth in his 1905 patent might be interpreted by some as a prediction or even discovery of schumann resonances .",
    "the interesting aspect is that it was a theoretical physicist , not an electrical engineer , who first discussed the earth - ionosphere cavity , and in an insightful way .",
    "fitzgerald , in 1893 , was indeed well before the appropriate time . and",
    "a talk to the british association , followed by brief mention in a column in _ nature _ , is not a prominent literature trail for later scientists .",
    "schumann may be forgiven for not citing fitzgerald , even though early on heaviside and kennelly addressed the effects of the ionosphere on radio propagation and a number of researchers examined the cavity in the intervening years .",
    "i suggest a fitting solution to attribution would be `` schumann - fitzgerald resonances . ''",
    "+ the name `` weizscker - williams method ( of virtual quanta ) '' is mainly the fault of the theoretical physics community . certainly , in the mid-1930 s the questions about the failure of qed at high energies were resolved by the work of weizscker and williams , and williams s danish academy paper showed the wide applicability of the method of virtual quanta together with special relativity .",
    "but fermi was the first to publish the idea of the equivalence of the fourier spectrum of the fields of a swiftly moving charged particle to a spectrum of photons in their actions on a struck system .",
    "williams knew that and so stated .",
    "the argument will be made that the choices of appropriate reference frame and struck system are vital to the weizscker - williams method , something fermi did not discuss , but fermi deserves his due .",
    "+ the relativistic equation for spin motion in electromagnetic fields is perhaps a narrow topic chiefly of interest to accelerator specialists .",
    "it is striking that it was fully developed by thomas at the dawn of quantum mechanics and before the discovery of repetitive particle accelerators such as the cyclotron .",
    "he was surely before his time .",
    "bargmann , michel , and telegdi were of an other era , with high energy physics a big business .",
    "the cuteness of the acronym bmt and the prestige of the authors made searches for prior work superfluous .",
    "although the use of `` bmt equation '' is common enough , it is encouraging that in the accelerator physics community the phrase `` thomas - bmt equation '' is now frequently used in research papers and in reviews and handbooks .",
    "@xcite + the zeroth theorem / arnold s law has some similarities to the `` matthew effect . ''",
    "@xcite the matthew effect describes how a more prominent researcher will reap all the credit even if a lesser known person has done essentially the same work contemporaneously , or how the most senior researcher in a group effort will get all the recognition , even though all the real work was done by graduate students or postdocs .",
    "the zeroth theorem might be considered as the first kind of matthew effect , but with some time delay , although some examples do not fit the prominent / lesser constrain .",
    "neither do my examples reflect , as far as i know , the possible influence by the senior researcher or friends to discount or ignore the contributions of others .",
    "the zeroth theorem stands on its own , examples often arising because the first enunciator was before his / her time or because the community was not diligent in searching the prior literature before attaching a name to the discovery or relation or effect . +",
