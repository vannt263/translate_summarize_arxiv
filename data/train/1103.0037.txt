    "the central problem of a quantum field theory is to compute its mass spectrum and the corresponding eigenstates .",
    "all physical quantities can be computed from these .",
    "if the theory is quantized in terms of light - front coordinates  @xcite , this spectral problem can be written as a hamiltonian eigenvalue problem  @xcite , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the light - front energy operator , @xmath2 is the light - front momentum operator , and @xmath3 are the corresponding eigenvalues . for an eigenstate of mass @xmath4 , the mass - shell condition @xmath5 yields @xmath6 .",
    "thus , eigenvalues of @xmath7 determine the mass spectrum .",
    "the standard light - front hamiltonian approach is to expand @xmath8 in a set of fock states , eigenstates of @xmath9 with definite numbers of constituents .",
    "the coefficients in the expansion are the light - front momentum - space wave functions .",
    "this takes advantage of two important aspects of light - front coordinates  @xcite : the relative - momentum coordinates separate from the external momentum , so that the wave functions depend only on the relative momenta , and the positivity of @xmath10 excludes vacuum contributions to the expansion , so that the wave functions represent the properties of the eigenstate only .",
    "given the fock - state expansion , the eigenvalue problem becomes an infinite set of coupled integral equations for the wave functions .",
    "the expansion and the coupled system are truncated to yield a finite problem , which is then solved , usually by numerical techniques  @xcite .    in more than two dimensions , some form of regularization",
    "is required to properly define the integrals of the coupled system .",
    "the cancellations that must take place in the regularization scheme are disrupted by the truncation , resulting in uncanceled divergences . a re - parameterization of the theory , such as sector - dependent parameterization  @xcite ,",
    "can be arranged to appear to absorb these divergences , but not simultaneously for all physical quantities  @xcite .",
    "the truncation also causes self - energy contributions and vertex functions to be dependent on the momenta of fock - state constituents that are only spectators to the process in question .",
    "this spectator and fock - state dependence results in great complications for the analysis and solution of the theory .    in particular , the ward identity of gauge theories is destroyed by truncation . for photon emission in qed",
    ", a one - photon truncation keeps only the self - energy correction to the electron leg on the side opposite the photon emission ; the self - energy correction on the other leg and the vertex loop correction are eliminated  @xcite .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ; only the first survives the truncation .",
    "graphs contributing to the ward identity in qed .",
    "only the first contributes in a one - photon truncation of the fock space.,width=377 ]    thus , the ward identity connecting vertex and wave - function renormalization is broken for interactions internal to a bound - state problem .",
    "this is what drives the renormalization of the charge in a sector - dependent parameterization of the theory  @xcite , but this is clearly unphysical and has nothing to do with ordinary charge renormalization .",
    "the analog of these difficulties with truncation can be induced in feynman perturbation theory by separating covariant diagrams into time - ordered diagrams and discarding those time orderings that include intermediate states with more particles than some finite limit .",
    "this destroys covariance , disrupts regularization , and induces spectator dependence for subdiagrams . in the nonperturbative case",
    ", this happens not just to some finite order in the coupling but to all orders .",
    "to avoid truncation , we introduce the exponential - operator technique of the many - body coupled - cluster ( cc ) method  @xcite .",
    "an eigenstate @xmath8 is written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is limited to one or a few fock sectors with the lowest number(s ) of constituents , the valence sector(s ) .",
    "the operator @xmath13 is a sum of operators that increase particle number but conserve momentum @xmath14 , the angular momentum component .",
    "determination of the @xmath15 eigenstates is a separate dynamical problem . ]",
    "@xmath16 , and all relevant quantum numbers , such as charge and baryon number .",
    "the factor @xmath17 is a normalization factor , such that @xmath18 .",
    "we then construct an effective eigenvalue problem in the valence sector , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a projection onto the valence sector .",
    "equations for the functions that determine @xmath13 are found by the orthogonal projection @xmath22 . up to this point",
    ", no approximation has been made , and the problem remains infinite , because there are infinitely many contributions to @xmath13 .    to have a finite set of equations , we truncate @xmath13 to a few operators and truncate the projection @xmath23 in a consistent way , such that just enough equations are produced to be able to solve for the functions in the truncated @xmath13 operator .",
    "for example , if @xmath13 can create one additional particle above the valence state , @xmath23 projects onto only this additional fock sector .",
    "after truncation , we have a finite set of nonlinear equations for the functions in @xmath13 , coupled to the valence - sector wave functions , and a valence - sector eigenvalue problem where the effective hamiltonian depends on the functions in @xmath13 .",
    "the former are essentially auxiliary equations that help define the latter .",
    "what is not truncated is the exponentiation of @xmath13 , and thus the full fock space can be retained , though the wave functions for the higher fock sectors are clearly only approximate .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is computed from its baker ",
    "hausdorff expansion @xmath24+\\frac12[[{{\\cal p}^-},t],t]+\\cdots$ ] .",
    "only a finite number of terms contributes , because each factor of @xmath13 increases the number of particles created , eventually exceeding the truncation of @xmath25 .",
    "although this light - front coupled - cluster ( lfcc ) method uses the mathematics of the traditional cc method  @xcite , it is quite different conceptually .",
    "in fact , the name coupled cluster does not really apply , but we use it to acknowledge the origin of the lfcc method .",
    "the cc method is applied to a single fock sector , with a large number of constituents .",
    "the @xmath13 operator builds correlated excitations onto a hartree  fock - type ground state . within products of @xmath13",
    "there are no contractions , because every term in @xmath13 annihilates one or more of the single - particle states in the ground state and creates one or more excited states . in the lfcc method",
    ", the valence sector has a small number of constituents , and the method of solution of the eigenvalue problem here is left unspecified .",
    "the terms of the @xmath13 operator do include annihilation , because the positive light - front momentum @xmath26 can not be conserved unless one or more particles are annihilated to provide momentum for those that are created . as a consequence ,",
    "powers of @xmath13 include contractions , but these are needed in order that @xmath13 to some power not annihilate the entire valence state , which would effectively truncate the exponentiation of @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the fundamental mass eigenvalue problem , the lfcc method must also contend with the evaluation of matrix elements of operators , in order to be able to extract physical quantities from the lfcc eigenstates .",
    "this is nontrivial , because a direct calculation of the normalizing factor @xmath17 is impractical , due to the infinite set of terms in the sum over fock states within @xmath27 .",
    "this same issue arises in the traditional cc method  @xcite , and there a technique exists for expectation values which can be adapted for the lfcc method and extended to include off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "some care must be taken , however , in that the lfcc method uses momentum eigenstates with dirac - delta normalization , unlike the unit normalization of the standard cc states .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath17 is introduced to avoid division by @xmath28 in the computation of expectation values .    for an operator @xmath29",
    "we write the expectation value @xmath30 in the state @xmath31 as @xmath32 and define @xmath33 and ( ) |=z()|e^t^e^t = ( ) |e^t , so that @xmath34 . by construction",
    ", we have ( )|()=()|()=(- ) and ( ) | = ( ) |e^t e^-tp^-e^t = ( ) | .",
    "thus , @xmath35 is a left eigenvector of the ( necessarily ) non - hermitian @xmath36 , with the same mass eigenvalue , normalized such that the projection onto the valence state is a simple momentum - conserving delta function .",
    "therefore , an expectation value is computed by constructing the effective operator @xmath37 from a baker  hausdorff expansion , solving the left - hand eigenvalue problem , and evaluating the inner product @xmath38 . as for @xmath36 , only a finite number of terms in the baker ",
    "hausdorff expansion of @xmath37 will contribute .",
    "the extension to off - diagonal matrix elements is straightforward .",
    "the left - hand eigenvalue problem must be truncated to an extent consistent with the truncation of @xmath13 , such that @xmath35 is limited to the fock sectors of the valence state plus those created by application of @xmath13 . to understand the truncation ,",
    "consider the following .",
    "define an operator @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the projection onto the valence eigenstate @xmath12 . because of the projection operators , @xmath41 is simply @xmath42 .",
    "the left - hand eigenstate can then be written as @xmath43 .",
    "we see , then , that @xmath44 plays the role of @xmath13 , and therefore should be truncated in the same way .",
    "the truncated left - hand eigenvalue problem creates a finite set of linear equations for the wave functions of @xmath35 .",
    "to illustrate the method , we apply it to a simple model where an analytic solution is known  @xcite .",
    "the model is a light - front analog of the greenberg  schweber model  @xcite for a static fermionic source that emits and absorbs bosons without changing its spin . in updated notation",

    "symmetry breaking and vacuum structure , modes of zero longitudinal momentum  @xcite play some role and would require extension of the method to include them ; in particular , the contributions to the @xmath13 operator would not require annihilation , and the exponentiation would produce generalized coherent states . for discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq )",
    "@xcite , where longitudinal momentum fractions are restricted to integer multiples of a fundamental amount @xmath92 , truncation to @xmath93 particles is automatic ; however , the method could still be applied as a way of reducing the effective dimension of the underlying matrix eigenvalue problem and allowing higher resolution .",
