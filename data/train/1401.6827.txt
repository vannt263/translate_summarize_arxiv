    "stars tend to be born in pairs and higher - order hierarchies .",
    "it has long been recognized that understanding stellar multiplicity is important in many areas of astronomy , from star formation to high - energy astrophysics . here",
    "we address the statistics of hierarchical multiples ( triple and quadruple systems ) among solar - type dwarfs , using the data of paper i @xcite .",
    "hierarchical stellar systems have been known since a long time .",
    "@xcite highlighted their significance as a potential key to solving the mystery of binary - star formation ( see recent discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite published the first list of hierarchical triples . meanwhile , other authors who studied binary statistics mentioned multiples only in passing",
    ". typically small samples of @xmath2 stars in these early works contained only a few hierarchies .    the paper by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "al76 ) demonstrated the importance of binary statistics and influenced the field for several decades . by a bold extrapolation it predicted that almost every solar - type star has a low - mass ( planetary ) companion .",
    "this prediction , shown later to be the result of data over - interpretation , stimulated nevertheless the search for very low - mass ( vlm ) companions and exo - planets .    the work by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dm91 ) remains even today one of the most cited papers on binary statistics .",
    "they corrected the overly - optimistic prognosis of the frequency of vlm companions , while still focusing on their importance ( few years later this team announced the first exo - planet around 51  peg ) .",
    "a similar study of k and m dwarfs @xcite reached the opposite conclusion that the vlm companions are rare ; this is now confirmed and known as _ brown - dwarf desert_. the log - normal distribution of periods proposed in dm91 was confirmed by further studies , including this one .",
    "two decades later , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter r10 ) revised the results of dm91 using better observing methods and a larger sample .",
    "they show that the mass ratio is distributed almost uniformly at all periods , overturning the claims to the contrary made in al76 and dm91 .",
    "the frequency of hierarchical systems was estimated at @xmath3% , doubled in comparison to dm91 .",
    "we show below that it is even a little higher .",
    "most known multiple stars result from random discoveries .",
    "information on triples and higher - order systems collected in the multiple star catalog , msc @xcite is heavily distorted by observational selection and not suitable for unbiased statistical study .",
    "@xcite attempted comparative analysis of triples and quadruples based on the msc .",
    "a similar effort was undertaken by @xcite , using bright stars and an _ ad hoc _ model of observational selection .",
    "this work is based on the volume - limited sample of 4847 unevolved ( or moderately evolved ) stars within 67pc of the sun with masses from 0.9 to 1.5@xmath4 , presented in paper i and called fg-67 sample hereafter .",
    "its completeness is no less than 90% as hierarchical systems are less frequent than binaries , the large sample size and a good companion census are essential here . equally important",
    "is the correction for the incomplete companion detection .",
    "paper  i outlines the model of companion s detection and provides estimates of detection probability ( completeness ) for each individual target , as a function of period and mass ratio . on average ,",
    "80% of companions to the main targets are detected .",
    "however , the census of sub - systems in the fainter , secondary components is worse , about 30% .",
    "we begin with the definition of hierarchical levels and mass ratio in   [ sec : h ] .",
    "then in   [ sec : pq ] the joint distribution of period and mass ratio is derived . in ",
    "[ sec : trip ] the statistical model of hierarchies is developed .",
    "it is based on the simple idea that all sub - systems are randomly drawn from the same generating distribution of periods , subject only to the dynamical stability constraint .",
    "this recipe requires , however , some adjustments to match the data .",
    "the summary and discussion in   [ sec : sum ] and   [ sec : disc ] , respectively , close the paper .",
    "a system of three or more bodies with comparable separations is dynamically unstable @xcite . in contrast , _ hierarchical _ multiples survive for a long time because the motion in the close ( inner ) pair is not strongly perturbed by the outer companion(s ) .",
    "stellar motions in stable hierarchies are represented approximately by keplerian orbits .",
    "this is the definition of a hierarchical multiple system .",
    "this definition is not very sharp because some systems approach the stability boundary .",
    "moreover , the orbital motion of very wide binaries is not observable owing to their long periods , so the borderline between the truly bound multiple systems and other stellar groups like disintegrating clusters is fuzzy .",
    "hierarchies can be described by binary graphs or trees , also called mobile diagrams ( one example is shown in figure  [ fig : levels ] ) .",
    "the position of each pair in the tree is called _ level _ and is denoted here as l1 , l11 , etc .",
    "the outermost ( widest ) pair is at the root of the tree , l1 ( the root is denoted by asterisk in the parent designation ) .",
    "inner pairs associated with the primary and secondary components are at levels l11 and l12 , respectively , and this notation continues to deeper levels .",
    "triple systems can have inner pair either at l11 or at l12 .",
    "when both primary and secondary sub - systems are present , we get the so - called _ 2 + 2 system _ .. in contrast , a 2 + 2 quadruple contains exactly 4 stars .",
    "] alternatively , a _ 3 + 1",
    "quadruple _ system consists of levels l1 , l11 , and l111 ; it has three companions associated with the same primary star , resembling in this respect a planetary system .",
    "both types of hierarchy are found in hip  88637 .",
    "the assignment of `` primary '' and `` secondary '' is traditionally based on the apparent brightness of the components .",
    "when they are comparable in brightness or mass , the distinction between primary and secondary becomes irrelevant .",
    "while we deal with binary and triple systems , their hierarchy is uniquely defined by the number of components , so levels are almost redundant . on the other hand , quadruple and",
    "higher - order systems can have different organizations , so their hierarchy requires additional descriptors such as levels . from the observational point of view",
    ", it is easier to explore lower hierarchical levels l1 , l11 , and l12 than to determine the number of multiple systems with _ exactly _ 3 , 4 , etc . components .    the fraction of non - single stellar systems , the _ multiplicity fraction _",
    "@xmath5 , equals the fraction of l1 systems in a given sample .",
    "the _ companion fraction _",
    "@xmath6 is the number of systems at all levels divided by the sample size , so @xmath7 .",
    "it is easier to measure @xmath5 , as it does not depend on the discovery of _ all _ sub - systems .",
    "multiplicity is also characterized by the fractions of systems with exactly @xmath8 components , @xmath9 . obviously , the fraction of single stars @xmath10 , while @xmath11 the fraction of hierarchies in a sample is @xmath12 .",

    "the system depicted in figure  [ fig : levels ] contains hierarchical levels most frequently found in the fg-67 sample : l11 ( @xmath13 ) , l12 ( @xmath14 ) , and l111 ( @xmath15 ) . here the statistical analysis of those three levels is made , because higher levels are rare , and a much larger sample would be needed for their study .      in a binary system with the primary component a and the secondary component b",
    ", the mass ratio is defined as @xmath16 . in a triple system where b is a close pair b , c",
    ", the mass ratio can be defined in different ways ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the classical approach is to use the mass sum of sub - systems in the _ system mass ratio _ @xmath17 .",
    "however , this definition may result in @xmath18 even when the component a is the most massive and brightest star in the system .",
    "alternatively , the _ component mass ratio _",
    "@xmath19 takes into account only the masses of individual stars ( primary components of respective sub - systems ) .",
    "for example , in a triple star consisting of the close binary a , b with a distant tertiary component c , @xmath20 , while @xmath21 .",
    "the detection limits of imaging techniques are based on the magnitude difference which is more tightly related to the component mass ratio @xmath22 than to @xmath23 .",
    "the use of @xmath22 avoids re - definition of `` primary '' and `` secondary '' that would be needed in many instances if we used the mass sum instead . in the following ,",
    "we use consistently the component mass ratio @xmath22 for multiple systems .",
    "the data on all systems and sub - systems in the fg-67 sample are assembled in the structure ( table ) which contains information on the hierarchical level ( with links to parents and siblings ) , period , and component s masses .",
    "the same structure is produced for the simulated samples .",
    "as binary periods @xmath24 span a huge range , we use instead the logarithm @xmath25 throughout this paper .",
    "the 22 targets containing white dwarfs ( wds ) are removed , leaving 2162 systems and sub - systems to consider ( the sample excludes evolved primary components by design , wds are such former primaries ) .",
    "the fraction of targets with wd companions is from 2% to 4% , according to the rather uncertain estimate of paper  i. as only 0.5% of known binaries are removed and most of the remaining wds are undiscovered , the total sample size without wds should be somewhere between 4650 and 4750 .",
    "the sample size affects the estimates of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , etc . here",
    "we set it conservatively to 4800 ( i.e. remove 1% of targets with wds ) .",
    "the multiplicity fraction derived here would be larger by @xmath261% if more targets with wds were removed .",
    "interestingly , among the 22 binaries with wds , 11 are at least triple , their fg - type primaries ( former secondaries ) contain sub - systems .",

    "@xmath60 $ ] , the derived @xmath61 implies preference of large mass ratios .",
    "indeed , most known binaries with such periods have @xmath62 because companions with @xmath63 have a low detection probability ( see figure  [ fig : pq ] ) .",

    ", the presence of the outer pair at l1 is a necessary condition .",
    "therefore , the resulting frequency @xmath55 refers to the sample of l1 systems , not to the whole sample .",
    "the ml results indicate that @xmath73 fraction of all targets have at least two companions around their primary stars .",
    "similarly , @xmath74 fraction of targets have binary secondaries .",
    "this last estimate depends on the larger ( and less certain ) correction for the low probability of detecting secondary sub - systems .    the total fraction of hierarchical systems @xmath75 is less than the sum of the above numbers ( 17% ) because those two groups overlap ( see below ) .",
    "about 0.6 fraction of l12 ( secondary ) sub - systems also have a l11 ( primary ) sub - system .",
    "the fraction of hierarchical systems is therefore estimated by ml as @xmath76 .",
    "a ballpark estimate of the uncertainty of this number is @xmath771% .",

    "the log - normal period distribution appears to be a good match to the data ( the dotted curves were _ not _ fitted to the histograms ! ) .",
    "previously , when the samples of binaries were small , the log - normal period distribution was an adequate model .",
    "however , its wings extend to unrealistically short and long periods ; for this reason we use the truncated gaussian here .",
    "a better analytic model of the period distribution could be a triangular function with a rounded top , @xmath80 ,   \\label{eq : tri}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 .",
    "this distribution extends over finite range from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , the parameter @xmath84 is close to the half - width .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 provides for the rounded top ( @xmath86 means pure triangle @xmath87 ) , the normalization factor @xmath53 depends on @xmath85 : @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "the need for three parameters @xmath89 instead of just two @xmath90 may be a disadvantage of this model , but on the other hand the triangular distribution does not require truncation .",
    "the ml formalism was adapted to use the triangular function instead of a gaussian .",
    "the results obtained with this alternative model are quite similar , they are not given here for brevity .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 was found , meaning that the top of the triangle is rounded only mildly .",
    "the `` shoulders '' of the period histograms in figure  [ fig : phist ] are indeed closer to straight lines than to a gaussian .",
    "usually the distributions of binary parameters were studied regardless of hierarchy , merging all pairs together ( dm91 , r10 ) .",
    "however , there is a significant ( factor 2.5 ) difference between the median period of _ all _ binaries and the median period of outer binaries at level l1 .",
    "the periods of l11 sub - systems are shorter than the periods of all binaries , being restricted by the dynamical stability .",
    "the period histogram at l11 deviates from the gaussian model , showing a depletion at @xmath92 and an excess at @xmath93 .",
    "considering the uncertainty associated with the missing data , we can not evaluate the significance of this mismatch .",
    "it is expected due to tidal migration of inner sub - systems towards short periods (   [ sec : kozai ] ) .",
    "note that the secondary sub - systems at l12 are only slightly less frequent that at l11 .",
    "the common belief that inner systems are preferentially found around primary components turns out to be true , but this preference is not strong .",
    "the median mass of the primary components at levels l11 and l12 is 1.20@xmath4 and 0.79@xmath4 , respectively .    the sub - systems at l12 show a tendency towards equal components , @xmath94 .",
    "only 5 secondary sub - systems out of 95 have unknown periods , making it difficult to explain high @xmath46 by the influence of the missing data . considering the bias towards large @xmath22 in the detection of secondary sub - systems ( see figure  [ fig : pq ] ) , the high @xmath46 derived here for l12 should be verified by further work before being accepted .",
    "however , @xmath95 would mean that more secondary sub - systems are presently missed , so their frequency would be even higher than the frequency of l11 .",
    "in this section , we study statistical relations between binaries at different hierarchical levels .",
    "are their periods or mass ratios related ? does the presence of one hierarchical level correlate with other levels ?",
    "we propose a statistical model and test it by comparing simulations with the real sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : plps ] compares orbital periods @xmath96 and @xmath97 at the inner and outer hierarchical levels respectively ( only known periods are plotted ) .",
    "it shows that the lowest period ratio @xmath98 is limited by the dynamical stability , but this ratio can also take large values ; there is no typical or preferred period ratio .",
    "the points occupy almost all the space above the stability cutoff , showing that all allowed combinations of periods actually happen .",
    "one striking feature of figure  [ fig : plps ] is the absence of outer periods shorter than @xmath99d , as noted already by @xcite .",
    "this is not caused by the observational selection , as tertiary companions with short periods are readily discovered by radial velocity variation ; the detection probability at @xmath100 is high , see figure  9 of paper  i. @xcite independently discovered the lack of short outer periods by eclipse timing of 41 binaries from _ kepler _ : 14 of them show trends indicative of tertiary companions , but none has tertiaries with @xmath101d . in the 3-tier hierarchies",
    "l11+l111 , the shortest period at l11 is @xmath102 , confirming the exclusion zone of outer periods found for the l1+l11 and l1+l12 hierarchies .",
    "this said , triple systems with short outer periods are known among more massive stars ( e.g. @xmath103  tau with @xmath104d ) .    the minimum period ( or separation ) ratio allowed by dynamical stability has been studied by several authors . for example , the stability criterion of @xcite for co - planar orbits can be written as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the eccentricity of the outer orbit , while the ratio of the distant - companion mass to the combined mass of the inner binary @xmath107 plays only a minor role .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig : plps ] corresponds to @xmath108 ; all points are above it ( with two exceptions caused by the uncertainty of period estimates from projected separations ) .",
    "@xcite studied the dependence of the period ratio on @xmath106 for triple stars with reliable outer orbits and suggested an empirical stability limit with a stronger dependence on @xmath106 , @xmath109    at @xmath110 , the limiting period ratio ( [ eq : mardling ] ) becomes a factor of 10 larger than at @xmath111 .",
    "the dynamical truncation of @xmath98 is random and extends over at least one decade , depending on the distribution of @xmath106 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dynam ] shows the cumulative distributions of this cutoff @xmath112 if a cosine distribution of @xmath106 between 0 and 0.8 is assumed , with average @xmath113 .",
    "available data on multiple stars indicate that orbits of outer systems tend to have moderate eccentricities @xcite , the linear distribution @xmath114 seems to be excluded .    here",
    "we use a crude model for the dynamical truncation function @xmath115 ( probability of a triple system to be dynamically stable ) by setting @xmath116 for @xmath117 , @xmath118 for @xmath119 , and linear in - between ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : dynam ] ) .",
    "this model agrees with the stability criterion of mardling & aarseth for the assumed distribution of @xmath106 , while the criterion ( [ eq : tok04 ] ) predicts a stronger cutoff .",
    "an attempt to determine the truncation empirically by the distance of points in figure  [ fig : plps ] above the solid line did not produce any convincing results .",
    "most outer and some inner periods are determined from projected separations to within a factor of 3 , so the empirical values of @xmath120 are approximate .",
    "for the same reason , precise knowledge of the truncation function @xmath121 is not needed here and its crude model is sufficient .",
    "the distributions of both inner and outer periods in the allowed region of figure  [ fig : plps ] look similar , as though they were drawn from the same population .",
    "are the periods at levels l11 and l12 shorter than at l1 simply because of the dynamical cutoff ?",
    "the idea that the inner and outer pairs of multiple stars are selected from the same ( or similar ) parent distributions , subject only to the stability constraint , merits further investigation .",
    "several arguments in its favor are furnished by prior work .",
    "@xcite noted that the mass ratios of close binaries with and without outer ( tertiary ) companions are distributed equally , although the former group has statistically shorter periods .",
    "the frequency of spectroscopic sub - systems in visual binaries is similar to the frequency of spectroscopic binaries in the open clusters and field @xcite .",
    "the frequency and mass ratio of resolved sub - systems in wide binaries are again comparable to the binaries of such separations in the field @xcite . finally , the angular momentum vectors in the inner and outer systems show only a weak correlation @xcite , and there are well documented cases of counter - rotating multiples .",
    "independent multiplicity is expressed mathematically by setting the joint period distribution at levels l1 and l11 to be a product of the individual distributions at these levels , including the dynamical truncation factor @xmath121 : @xmath122 figure  [ fig : indep ] illustrates this statistical model . the _ generating distribution _ for l11 , @xmath123 , could be the same as the period distribution at l1 , @xmath124 .",
    "this logic can be applied to other levels , leading to a complete statistical description of hierarchical multiplicity .",
    "comparison with the real data presented below shows that this model is too simplistic and needs several adjustments .",
    "however , to the first order , it works even in its simplest form .",
    "an attempt was made to test this idea using the ml method .",
    "the truncation function was added as a multiplier to the distribution ( [ eq : gauss ] ) and the 4 parameters were found for the sub - systems at l11 and l12 .",
    "the resulting distributions can be thought of as the generating functions @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the problem of this approach is that almost all sub - systems have @xmath127 ( see figure  [ fig : plps ] ) , so the data do not constrain the generating functions at longer periods .",
    "this means that the fitted parameters of the generating distributions @xmath128 do not inspire confidence , and only the distributions at @xmath127 ( left halves of the gaussians ) are more or less defined .",
    "moreover , a gaussian distribution is not a good model for the sub - systems at l11 ( figure  [ fig : phist ] ) .",
    "we do not list here the fitted parameters and simply plot the relevant parts of the generating distributions in figure  [ fig : gen ] .",
    "the periods of l12 sub - systems turn out to be shorter and their frequency at @xmath129 is even higher than the frequency of levels l1 and l11 .",
    "however , considering the uncertainties involved in this crude model , we can only state that all three curves are not very different from each other and that selecting periods at outer and inner levels from the _ same distribution _ is not such a bad idea .      in this sub - section ,",
    "we simulate the multiplicity of the fg-67 sample .",
    "a synthetic population of single , binary , and multiple stars is created by a random draw from the generating distribution ( [ eq : gauss ] ) with parameters @xmath130 .",
    "the period distribution is truncated at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the binary frequency @xmath55 is specified below .",
    "for each component of a binary pair with @xmath131 , the sub - systems are drawn from the same distribution and retained with a probability @xmath132 defined above .",
    "the recipe is applied recursively to produce high - order hierarchies .",
    "after that , the synthetic sample is `` filtered '' by the average detection probability of the real sample ( different for the primary and secondary components ) and compared to the real sample .",
    "multiple systems with more than two hierarchical levels ( 3-tier hierarchy ) pose a specific problem for their detection .",
    "suppose that in a quadruple ( ( ( aa , ab),b),c ) the component b is missed ( un - detected ) .",
    "the system will be perceived as a triple ( ( aa , ab),c ) , i.e. we miss the intermediate hierarchical level ; the pair aa , ab is attributed to l11 , instead of l111 .",
    "now suppose that the true system is ( ( a,(ba , bb)),c ) and we miss the same component b. in such case , we ca nt discover ( ba , bb ) , the observed system becomes a simple binary ( a , c ) .",
    "our detection simulator eliminates all siblings of un - detected secondary components but keeps those of the primary , and corrects the hierarchical levels to reflect the observed , rather than true , structure of each system .",
    "straightforward application of the above recipe with a fixed @xmath55 over - produces binaries and under - produces triples , while the total number of l1 systems ( the multiplicity fraction ) is correct .",
    "therefore , sub - systems at different hierarchical levels do have some correlation .",
    "the simulator is modified by adopting a variable binary frequency @xmath55 ( however , @xmath55 is same for each individual multiple system ) .",
    "when @xmath55 is high , many hierarchical multiples are produced , and when it is low , we get mostly single stars and simple binaries .",
    "this reflects the idea that the field sample is a mixture of `` binary - rich '' and `` binary - poor '' populations .",
    "the _ average _ @xmath55 is constrained by the observed multiplicity fraction @xmath5 , while the relative proportion of hierarchies informs us on the variation of @xmath55 .",
    "the frequency of binary stars is proportional to @xmath55 , the frequency of triples to @xmath133 , etc . by adopting a variable @xmath55 , we enhance the fraction of hierarchies until it matches the real sample ( the same result could be obtained by increasing @xmath55 for inner hierarchical levels ) .",
    "we split the simulated sample in three equal parts and apply to each group its own frequency @xmath134 .",
    "the correct fraction of hierarchies was obtained , for example , for @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "these numbers were found by trial and error , their mean 0.466 is the simulated multiplicity fraction . compared to the constant multiplicity",
    ", the fraction of triples is increased by @xmath136 .",
    "there are other ways to model variable @xmath55 by adopting some distribution and playing with its parameters .",
    "the distribution of @xmath55 chosen here is discrete with three equally probable values .",
    "although the values of @xmath55 quoted above produce a good match to the data , other combinations or recipes are not excluded .",
    "the simulator needs yet another adjustment to reproduce the large observed number of 2 + 2 systems .",
    "if primary and secondary sub - systems at levels l11 and l12 are generated independently of each other , their common occurrence is too rare .",
    "the observed numbers of systems containing l11 , l12 , and both levels ( i.e. 2 + 2 systems ) are @xmath137 =   [ 296,95,41]$ ] .",

    "let @xmath139 be the number of l1 ( outer ) binaries in the sample .",

    "the excess of 2 + 2 systems indicates correlation between levels l11 and l12 .",

    "the simulator over - estimates the number of sub - systems at high hierarchical levels l111 , l121 , l112 , etc . because it does not account for tidal evolution in close inner binaries and selects their periods from the same log - normal distribution .",

    "this supports the underlying idea of independent multiplicity .",
    "therefore , the shorter periods of sub - systems at levels l11 and l12 ( compared to all binaries ) can be explained by the dynamical truncation alone .",
    "figure  [ fig : multfrac ] illustrates one aspect of the data that is not yet captured by the simulator . all binaries up to a certain period @xmath24 are selected , and the observed fraction of inner pairs in multiples ( levels higher than l1 ) among those binaries is plotted .",
    "the fraction of inner systems reaches @xmath166 at @xmath167d and slowly drops to 0.18 with increasing period .",
    "the fraction of inner pairs in the simulated sample ( with the detection filter applied ) , plotted in dashed line , is quite similar to the observed one , except at @xmath168d where it is much lower .",
    "inner binaries in triple systems with mutually inclined orbits experience periodic modulation of their eccentricity by the kozai - lidov cycles .",
    "when the separation at periastron becomes comparable to the stellar radii , tidal friction absorbs the orbital energy and the period of the inner binary shortens to @xmath169d .",

    "tidal migration of inner periods reflects in their period distribution ( lower panel in figure  [ fig : phist ] ) , although the addition of unknown fictitious periods to the histogram partially masks the effect .",

    "the period distribution of spectroscopic binaries in the hyades @xcite clearly shows the depletion at @xmath172d and the peak at shorter periods .",
    "the non - monotonous period distribution was also found by @xcite .",
    "tidal evolution explains why the median period at l111 is shorter that its simulated value and why the simulator over - estimates the number of high hierarchical levels .",
    "apparently , some close inner binaries merged .",
    "we examined correlations between the mass ratios in triple systems .",
    "the 199 simple triples ( levels l11 or l12 without further inner sub - systems , with known periods and masses ) are used .",
    "the data are affected to some extent by the observational selection , as no simple correction can be suggested in this case .",
    "we found no correlation between the mass ratios in inner and outer systems and between the mass ratio and the period .",
    "similar conclusion was reached by @xcite from analysis of the biased catalog .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : q3 ] plots the ratio @xmath173 of the distant companion s mass to the mass sum of the inner binary .",
    "the median value of @xmath23 for outer binaries is 0.39 , with no obvious dependence on the outer period @xmath97 ( when the sample is split in two halves at @xmath174d , the @xmath23 medians are 0.40 and 0.39 ) .",
    "the median mass of the tertiary components is 0.73@xmath4 , the median mass of the secondary components in _ all _ binaries is 0.70@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence that the distant tertiary components are less massive than the components of the inner binaries .",
    "@xcite noted that in 2 + 2 quadruples with @xmath175d both inner binaries have similar total masses and periods .",
    "the fg-67 sample contains only 5 such quadruples , all with @xmath176 .",
    "the statistics are too small to make any further conclusions .",
    "we checked whether twin binaries have any preference to be found in multiple systems .",
    "half of the 96 binaries with @xmath177d are inner sub - systems ( see figure  [ fig : multfrac ] ) . among those 96 binaries ,",
    "18 are twins with @xmath178 , and 8 of those twins ( also a half ) are in inner sub - systems .",
    "therefore , the phenomenon of twin binaries is not directly related to the hierarchical multiplicity .",
    "the mass ratios of all binaries , including twins , seem to be independent of their hierarchical level .",
    "one notable exception to the above statement concerns secondary sub - systems at l12 which show a tendency to equal masses , @xmath179 , according to the ml parameter - fitting (   [ sec : param ] ) .",
    "about half of those binaries ( 41 out of 95 ) also have primary sub - systems at l11 .",
    "the median mass ratio in those 41 primary sub - systems is 0.75 , while the remaining majority of l11 sub - systems have median mass ratio of 0.65 .",
    "this result does not rely on the ml analysis or completeness correction , it is a straightforward comparison between the primary sub - systems whose outer companions are themselves either binary or single .",
    "preference of equal masses is thus typical for _ both _ inner pairs in 2 + 2 hierarchies .",
    "this suggests that they could have formed differently , compared to other binary and triple stars .",
    "the main results of this study are :    1 .",
    "we confirm known facts about binary statistics of solar - type stars .",
    "periods of all binaries ( regardless of their hierarchy ) are distributed log - normally with a median @xmath180 ( @xmath26100yr ) and dispersion 2.4 .",
    "the mass ratio is distributed uniformly and is independent ( or almost independent ) of the period , except such details as short - period twins .",
    "the multiplicity fraction is @xmath181 .",
    "the fraction of hierarchical systems is 0.13@xmath770.01 , of which 0.10 have sub - system(s ) related to the primary component , 0.07 have sub - systems in the secondary component , and 0.04 have both ( figure  [ fig : stat ] ) . the presence of sub - systems in both components of wide ( outer ) binaries is correlated .",
    "3 .   there remain about 150 undiscovered secondary ( l12 ) sub - systems .",
    "about 60% of those pairs reside in 2 + 2 hierarchies , because of the above correlation .",
    "the lack of outer systems with periods shorter than @xmath261000d is real ( not a selection effect ) .",
    "the statistics of hierarchical systems can be reproduced by recursive random selection of outer and inner binaries from the same generating period distribution with parameters @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and uniform mass ratio , @xmath184 ( @xmath151 for the secondary sub - systems ) .",
    "the amplitude of this distribution is variable ( e.g. @xmath185 $ ] with equal probability ) . only dynamically",
    "stable combinations are kept , with the dynamical cutoff in @xmath186 uniformly distributed between 0.7 and 1.7 .",
    "the frequency of secondary sub - systems is enhanced by their correlation with the primary sub - systems , while binaries with periods shorter than 1000d do not produce sub - systems .",
    "the period distribution in the inner sub - systems can be explained by dynamical truncation .",
    "however , there is an excess of tight inner binaries with @xmath177d compared to the smooth gaussian distribution , presumably caused by tidal evolution .",
    "the mass ratios in the inner and outer systems of triple stars are uncorrelated , except 2 + 2 hierarchies where the mass ratios are larger than average in both of their inner sub - systems . in triple stars ,",
    "the system mass ratio of the outer binary does not depend on its period and has a median value of 0.39 , meaning that the masses of tertiary components are comparable to the masses of stars in the inner binary .",

    "this tendency was noted by @xcite .",
    "the simulations faithfully reproduce the fraction of close binaries belonging to higher - order systems for the inner periods longer than 10d ( figure  [ fig : multfrac ] ) ; at shorter inner periods , the observed fraction is much higher than predicted , because of tidal evolution .",

    "the multiplicity simulator developed here is anchored to the data and can be used in such studies with confidence .",
    "correlated presence of sub - systems in both components of a wide binary is the new fact found in the course of this project @xcite . to reproduce this correlation by simulation , the frequency of secondary sub - systems is enhanced in presence of the primary sub - system and decreased otherwise . as a result , the majority of quadruple systems have the 2 + 2 hierarchy ( 67% observed , 74% predicted after correction of observational selection , 82% in the 25-pc sample ) .",

    "both inner sub - systems in the 2 + 2 hierarchies differ from the rest of inner sub - systems by their larger mass ratios (   [ sec : q ] ) . on the other hand , when only _ one _ inner sub - system is present , it is preferentially associated with the most massive star , and its mass ratio is distributed uniformly , as in normal binaries .",
    "therefore , there must be another , dominant formation channel which produces most binary and triple stars and , by extension , 3 + 1 quadruples .",
    "statistical work on multiple stars , including this one , is motivated by the desire to understand their formation .",
    "what have we learned from this study ?",
    "hydrodynamical simulations @xcite reveal a complex process of binary formation and early evolution that shapes the multiplicity statistics .",
    "stellar pairs form by fragmentation with initial separations larger than 10 - 100au ( so - called opacity limit ) and small masses .",
    "the components grow by accreting gas and , at the same time , migrate to smaller separations . the depletion of long periods ( the right side of the `` gaussian '' ) by dynamical interactions with the environment , combined with migration , shape the observed period distribution @xcite .",
    "if the fragmentation generates periods @xmath196 longer than , say , @xmath205 ( a step function in @xmath28 ) and the period decay @xmath206 is a random function ( e.g. uniformly distributed ) , the convolution of those two distributions results in the linear decrease of binary frequency at @xmath129 , as actually observed ( figure  [ fig : phist ] ) .",
    "the approximately linear decrease of the period distribution at @xmath129 is produced under a wide range of assumptions , provided only that the initial period distribution has a lower cutoff and that the migration is random .",
    "migration is essential in understanding the origin of tight hierarchical systems where 3 or 4 stars are packed in a small volume .",
    "if all inner binaries formed with initial periods @xmath207 , the initial outer periods must be even longer , whereas the present - day outer periods can be as short as @xmath208 ( figure  [ fig : plps ] ) .",
    "migration occurs therefore at all hierarchical levels .",
    "the inner binaries must migrate faster or form earlier than the outer binaries , otherwise the multiple system becomes dynamically unstable and decays .",
    "most hierarchies seem to be assembled `` from inside - out '' , by bringing together pre - fabricated inner pairs ( or stars ) to make the outer system .",
    "the success of modeling the observed statistics by independent multiplicity strongly supports this view .",
    "the mass ratios of inner and outer systems do not correlate , the masses of outer ( tertiary ) components are comparable to the masses of the inner components .",
    "the inner and outer periods are selected independently from the same distribution and are mutually related only by the dynamical stability ( taking aside the tidal evolution ) . if hierarchies formed `` from outside - in '' by successive fragmentation of outer binaries , as envisioned e.g. by @xcite , it would be difficult to explain the independent multiplicity .",
    "considering that many hierarchies are close to the stability limit , dynamical decay of multiple systems must occur sometimes .",
    "it can happen when the outer binary migrates faster than the inner one or when other stars in the cluster disrupt the multiple or exchange components with it .",
    "however , multiple systems produced by @xmath144-body dynamical interactions ( or surviving them ) have characteristics that do not match real hierarchies : high eccentricities , low masses of distant components , and moderate ratios @xmath98 .",
    "the observed multiplicity statistics indicates that dynamical processes play only a secondary role .",
    "most hierarchical stellar systems in the field are not the surviving remnants of primordial clusters .",
    "the 2 + 2 hierarchies could be formed in a special way , e.g. by inelastic collision of two cores that prompts their fragmentation into sub - systems and , at the same time , keeps these two pairs together on a common wide orbit by dissipating the energy .",
    "such impulsively - triggered multiple - star formation was envisioned by @xcite , see his figure  2 .",
    "further evolution will depend on the relative orientation of the inner and outer orbits .",
    "if they are not aligned , the inner binaries will accrete gas with a misaligned angular momentum , which will accelerate their migration to short periods . in the opposite case of co - aligned orbits",
    ", the accretion will keep the inner binaries wide , and a quadruple with a moderate @xmath98 ratio and nearly co - planar orbits , resembling @xmath209  lyr , can be formed . another striking aspect of this prototypical 2 + 2 quadruple ",
    "similar masses of all 4 stars  matches the tendency to equal component masses in both inner sub - systems of 2 + 2 hierarchies , emerging from this study .    on the other hand , the majority of the inner sub - systems have @xmath210 , like all binaries , while their tertiary components are single .",
    "their formation process should therefore be different from the formation of 2 + 2 hierarchies .",
    "the tertiary component could have formed around the initial binary ( or joined it ) at a later stage .",
    "the cascade can continue further by adding yet another star in a 3 + 1 hierarchy .",
    "the 2 + 2 formation channel probably produced more quadruples than actually observed because some sub - systems merged , leaving triples and binaries , while some quadruples decayed dynamically .",
    "a certain fraction of binaries and triples in the field could be born as 2 + 2 systems .",
    "also , merging of the inner binaries ( natural extension of migration ) can possibly help in understanding why the outer periods in triple stars are longer than @xmath99d .",
    "it should be stressed that not _ all _ close binaries belong to multiple stars .",
    "this is true only for pairs with @xmath167d which could not be produced without tidal migration during their main - sequence life . at longer periods @xmath211d ,",
    "the frequency of wide tertiary companions is comparable to the frequency of such companions in the full sample @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : form ] illustrates the formation channels and the fractions of different hierarchies in the field .",
    "the fragmentation produces single and binary stars .",
    "cascade `` inside - out '' fragmentation generates 2 + 1 triples and 3 + 1 quadruples .",
    "unstable hierarchies decay dynamically into single and binary stars , some close binaries merge . the alternative 2 + 2 process creates quadruple stars with components of similar mass .",
    "merging of inner pairs in the 2 + 2 quadruples contributes to the populations of triples and binaries . about 1% of targets with more than 4 components",
    "could be produced by the combination of these elementary processes .",
    "there are various ways to improve and continue the present study .",
    "the determination of unknown periods and mass ratios of close binaries is one obvious project to pursue .",
    "the prediction of the large number of undiscovered sub - systems in the secondary components should be tested observationally .",
    "it will be interesting to study relative motions in resolved triple and quadruple systems to get a better idea of the relative orbit orientation .",
    "the data used in this work are acknowledged in paper  i. i thank bo  reipurth and m.  bate for comments on the draft of this paper , p.  eggleton for discussions of multiplicity statistics and white dwarfs .",
    "we want to model the data  periods and mass ratios of binaries  by an analytical distribution function @xmath44 such as equation  [ eq : gauss ] , i.e. find the best - fitting parameters of this model and their errors .",
    "some data are missing ( unknown periods and mass ratios ) .",
    "let the sample of @xmath144 targets contain @xmath212 known binary systems with period logarithms @xmath213 and mass ratios @xmath214 .",
    "for each target ( binary or single ) we also estimate the companion detection probability @xmath215 . we maximize the _ likelihood function _ @xmath216  the probability of getting the actual data , given the model parameters . the maximum likelihood ( ml ) approach used here is equivalent to the bayesian method @xcite with uniform priors .",
    "for each @xmath217th star , the probability @xmath218 follows the poisson distribution @xmath219 with parameter @xmath220 ( probability of a detectable companion ) and the integer argument @xmath221 for single stars and @xmath222 for binaries .",
    "the stars are observed independently of each other , so @xmath216 is the product of @xmath218 . instead of maximizing @xmath223 ,",
    "we minimize its natural logarithm @xmath224 .",
    "elementary derivation leads to @xmath225 the summation over @xmath226 extends only over detected companions .",
    "the first term equals @xmath227 , @xmath228 is the average probability of companion detection .",
    "the probabilities for the binary companions are @xmath229 , while for all targets @xmath220 in the first term are the products @xmath230 averaged over the considered part of the parameter space @xmath231 .",
    "any normalization factor in the probabilities @xmath232 for binaries that is independent of the parameters has no influence on the result .    for binaries with known periods but unknown secondary masses ,",
    "the products @xmath233 are averaged over @xmath234 .",
    "the rationale is that binaries with @xmath235 would have been recognized as double - lined or resolved , therefore the unknown mass ratios are somehow constrained .",
    "binaries where both period and mass ratio are unknown have the detection probabilities averaged over @xmath236 and also over periods , assuming @xmath79 .",
    "it is important to include both kinds of binaries with partial information in the calculation , as they are actually discovered .    for each binary ,",
    "the detection probabilities are computed on the 2-dimensional grid with 100 points in @xmath28 , @xmath237 , and 20 points in @xmath22 .",
    "calculation of detection probability for the secondary components is done by a different program , as explained in paper  i , and saved in a different array of the same dimension .",
    "the distribution function @xmath44 is computed on the same grid , the first bin in @xmath22 is set to zero ( no companions with @xmath48 ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath53 in equation  ( [ eq : gauss ] ) is computed numerically .",
    "the ml formalism was tested on the simulated samples . here",
    "the model and the sample match by definition , and the ml method indeed recovers the true parameters of the distributions , even when a realistic fraction of binaries is assumed to have unknown periods and mass ratios , as in the real sample .    for calculation of the generating distributions at levels",
    "l11 and l12 , the ml algorithm was modified to include the dynamical truncation function @xmath121 . for calculating the mass - ratio distribution in selected intervals of period",
    ", the detection probabilities are averaged over these intervals , leaving only their dependence on @xmath22 .",
    "then only two parameters @xmath238 are fitted to the data .",
    "the contours of @xmath239 in the parameter space define confidence limits : @xmath240 corresponds to the 68% interval ( 1@xmath57 ) , @xmath241 to 90% , etc .",
    ", in direct analogy with the gaussian probability distribution .",
    "the error of some parameter @xmath191 is computed from the one - dimensional function @xmath242 , while other parameters are fixed .",
    "this is correct if the parameters are not correlated .",
    "we checked the absence of strong correlation by plotting the contours of @xmath239 while varying any two parameters around their best values .",
    "the contours are more or less round , indicating the lack of significant correlation between the parameters .",
    "the ml method appears more rigorous than it actually is .",
    "its systematic errors ( biases ) are caused by the mismatch between the actual data and their model ( both the parametrized distribution and the detection probabilities ) .",
    "the confidence intervals returned by the ml describe only the statistical errors and do not account for these systematic errors .",
