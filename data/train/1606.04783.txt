    "frustrated quantum spin systems exhibit exotic ground states such as valence bond solid ( vbs ) , spin - nematic , and quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) states with the effects of quantum fluctuations and frustration @xcite . even in classical systems ,",

    "however , the exact diagonalization studies were limited to small systems of up to about 36 spins , and the spin wave analysis assumed only three magnetic structures . since the correct low - energy quantum fluctuations are reproduced only in sufficiently large systems and the possible magnetic structures are not limited to the three states , the possibility of finding new quantum states in magnetic fields still exists .",

    "this kind of smooth change is also observed in the correlation functions @xmath34 , which confirms a continuous transition . in these phases ,",
    "one of the four spins is almost fully polarized ( more than 95% of full polarization ) and the correlations with the nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor spins are negligibly small with absolute values of less than 0.05 .",
    "hence , the nearly fully polarized spins are almost independent of the other spins .",
    "the other three spins in the unit cell interact with each other through the antiferromagnetic interactions and they are in a similar situation to frustrated spins on a triangular lattice .",
    "we therefore expect that the spin structures of these phases will be composed of one up - spin and the spin structure of the triangular lattice .",
    "we thus understand that the uuud state of the 1/2 plateau is the uud state of the 1/3 plateau of the triangular lattice @xcite with one additional up - spin .",
    "indeed , at @xmath5=0.5 the ground state of the hamiltonian for the three spins is shown to be the exact ground state of the triangular heisenberg model in the classical limit . from the correspondence between the hamiltonian for the three spins and the triangular heisenberg model , the phases around the uuud phase should correspond to the y phase and v phase of the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "we thus name the phases around @xmath49 2.1 and 3.0 as the y - like phase and v - like phase , respectively .",
    "although we have not yet confirmed the presence of an off - diagonal long - range order in the y - like and v - like phases , the clear periodic structure of @xmath32 and the stable transverse correlation @xmath50 with gapless spin excitations suggest that these phases have the characteristics of a supersolid @xcite .",

    "[ ph],width=249 ]      in a high magnetic field of @xmath49 3.6 , close to the phase transition to the transverse stripe phase at @xmath49 4 , the one - dimensionally ordered state shown in fig .  [ ph ] is realized .",
    "the distribution of the local magnetization @xmath32 has a stripe structure mainly consisting of almost fully polarized spins .",
    "the schematic classical spin structure is represented in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ ph ] , and we name this phase the @xmath4 phase .",
    "we consider that with the reduction of the dimensionality , the quantum fluctuations are enhanced under competition with the zeeman energy that stabilizes fully polarized spins . similarly to the one up - spin in the magnetic unit cell of the y - like , uuud , and v - like phases , almost fully polarized spins are nearly independent of the other spins . in the y - like , uuud , and v - like phases , each of the almost fully polarized spins is surrounded by eight quantum mechanically correlated spins .",
    "since the magnetic unit cell includes 4-spins , one out of four spins is ejected from the quantum mechanically correlated spins . in the @xmath4 phase , two out of four spins",
    "are ejected and one - dimensionally correlated spin chains are formed .",
    "these states have a common feature of forming domains of nearly independent fully polarized spins , which are expected to be realized in the highly frustrated region where the zeeman energy competes with the quantum fluctuations . in the periodic - boundary conditions ( torus ) at @xmath5=0.5 , the stripe structure of the local magnetization has been rigorously proved to be an eigenstate @xcite .",
