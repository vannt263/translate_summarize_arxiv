    "in the hartree approximation @xcite , a system of electrons move in a common potential arising from the electrostatic field of the electrons , in addition to the external field . in this approximation , a given electron experiences the electrostatic potential from the other electrons as well as from itself because the common potential or the hartree potential contains the field from the electron itself .",
    "this unphysical self - interaction is removed when exchange interaction is included , leading to the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) @xcite . in density",
    "functional theory @xcite , perdew and zunger introduced the concept of self - interaction correction @xcite to remove a similar problem in the local density approximation ( lda ) .    for many - electron systems , such as solids",
    ", it is well known that the hfa is not satisfactory because it completely neglects screening which is very crucial in describing the electronic structure of many - electron systems .",
    "thus , for example , the hartree - fock band gaps of semiconductors and insulators are much too wide and when the hfa is applied to metals the density of states at the fermi level becomes unphysically zero due to the logarithmic singularity in the derivative of the one - particle energy with respect to the @xmath4-vector at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the simplest known and successful method beyond the hfa that cures the band - gap problem and the anomaly of the hfa in metals is the @xmath6 approximation ( gwa ) @xcite .",
    "the gwa includes the effects of frequency - dependent screening from first principles and the self - energy in space - time representation is approximated by a product of the green function @xmath7 and the screened interaction @xmath8    the gwa includes the exchange potential so that it is self - interaction free .",
    "however , it is contaminated by `` self - screening '' , namely , an electron screens itself , analogous to `` self - interaction '' where an electron interacts with its own electrostatic field .",
    "this undesirable self - screening effect has been a long - standing problem and thought to be a source of significant errors in the electronic structure .",
    "the self - screening problem may be illustrated by the famous case of the hydrogen atom .",
    "since there is only one electron , it is clear that the one - particle removal energy or the hole energy is simply given by 13.6 ev , the @xmath9 orbital energy .",
    "the hartree approximation applied to the hydrogen atom would yield a too low removal energy due to the self - interaction error while the hfa would give the correct result .",
    "embarassingly , when the gwa is applied to the hydrogen atom , it yields a wrong result because , as a consequence of self - screening , the correlation part of the _ hole _ self - energy in the gwa is not zero @xcite .",
    "evidently , since there is only one electron , upon removal of the electron there are no other electrons that can screen the remaining hole so that the hole self - energy ought to be zero .",
    "the self - screening error is believed to be responsible for a number of well - known problems .",
    "it has been suspected for a long time that the presence of self - screening in the @xmath6 self - energy may be responsible for errors in the quasiparticle energies of localized states .",
    "it has been found that @xmath6 quasiparticle energies of core or semicore states usually lie above the experimental values . it is argued that in the hfa the quasiparticle energies are too low due to the absence of screening and when screening is taken into account within the gwa , these energies are pushed up too high , an indication of overscreening due to self - screening . in molecules , a recent comprehensive and systematic study of 34 molecules has found that the gwa overscreens the hartree - fock ionization potential leading to underestimation by @xmath10 ev compared to experiment @xcite . in many materials , the energy position of the core or semicore states is usually too high in the lda due to self - interaction .",
    "@xmath6 calculations on the 3d semicore states of a number of semiconductors such as gaas and znse improve the lda results but the remaining error is still significant @xcite .",
    "it is very likely that this error owes its origin from self - screening . from physical consideration",
    "the self - screening error is expected to be significant when the states are rather localized but less important in extended states    in this paper , we develop a new scheme which aims at correcting the self - screening error in the @xmath6 self - energy as well as the linear density - density response function within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "an interesting consequence of the proposed scheme is the fact that the screened interaction @xmath11 becomes explicitly spin dependent , in contrast to the original gwa where the screened interaction is spin independent .",
    "we also furnish a theoretical support for the scheme by showing from diagrammatic consideration that the removal of the self - screening terms is partially equivalent to adding exchange diagrams . in other words ,",
    "the self - screening terms are cancelled by corresponding terms in the exchange diagrams .    as an illustration of our scheme , we calculate the bonding - antibonding gap of a model hydrogen dimer . we have chosen this model because the exact result is known allowing for rigorous comparison .",
    "moreover , the calculations can be performed analytically so that possible numerical errors are eliminated and the simplicity of the system permits us to analyze the results without unnecessary complicating factors .",
    "it is found that the self - screening corrected gwa reproduces the exact result to order @xmath12^{2}$ ] , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively the onsite and offsite coulomb energies and @xmath3 is the hopping integral .",
    "the first step of the procedure is to decompose the non - interacting green function into its orbital components : @xmath13@xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a one - particle hamiltonian , @xmath17 for an occupied state and @xmath18 for an unoccupied state .",
    "we refer to @xmath19 as orbital green functions . in the gwa",
    "the self - energy is given by , using a non - interacting @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath11 is the screened interaction @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the dielectric matrix .",
    "consider an electron occupying an orbital @xmath24 propagating from @xmath25 to @xmath26 represented by @xmath27 .",
    "another electron with the _ same spin _ can not occupy the orbital @xmath24 and therefore @xmath27 should not participate in the screening process during the propagation of the electron . therefore the screened interaction @xmath11 should be calculated using a polarization propagator that does not include @xmath27 .",
    "however , an electron in the same orbital but with opposite spin can naturally participate in the screening process .",
    "the self - energy then takes the following form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 the polarization @xmath31 is defined as the polarization without @xmath27 , i.e. , no green function line in @xmath31 contains @xmath27 .",
    "in other words , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the green function without @xmath27 , namely,@xmath34 in fig . [ diagrams ] the self - energy diagrams corresponding to ( [ sigma_ssc ] ) are compared with the conventional @xmath6 diagrams .",

    "the correlation part of the self - energy may be divided into two parts , @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 is the spectral function of @xmath44 and we have used the relations @xmath45 and @xmath46 the corresponding expressions for the self - energy in the conventional gwa are the same as above except that @xmath43 is replaced by the spectral function of @xmath11 instead .",
    "it is worth noting that the self - screening correction introduces spin dependence in the screened interaction @xmath11 as can be seen in ( [ sigma_ssc ] ) .",
    "each electron experiences a different screened interaction @xmath47 which is not only orbital dependent but also spin dependent according to the orbital occupied by the electron as well as the spin of the electron .    since in the exact set of hedin s equations the screened interaction @xmath11 is spin independent",
    "the appearance of a spin - dependent screened interaction seems unnecessary .",
    "it is interesting to make comparison with density functional theory . in principle",
    ", the total energy is obtainable from the ground - state electron density , which is the sum of spin up and down components . in practice , for spin - polarized systems it is more favorable to introduce the spin variable and regard the total energy as a functional of the up and down spin densities .",
    "the separation of the density into the up and down components mimics the true system and captures the essential physics so that a relatively simple approximation , such as the local spin density approximation , still works well . a presumably much more complicated functional",
    "would be required to achieve the same level of accuracy for the total energy if the total density were to be used instead .",
    "a similar situation arise in our case , where the orbital and spin - dependent screened interactions closely mirror the physical situation and thereby promotes a better self - energy within the simple gwa .",
    "if we kept the conventional screened interaction , we would need to include exchange diagrams as vertex corrections to cancel the self - screening terms , as shown in a later section .",
    "it is much simpler to remove the self - screening terms than to include vertex corrections .      for extended states",
    ", the self - screening correction tends to vanish .",
    "however , from the physical point of view , we expect that the self - screening correction is significant when the state originates from a localized orbital such as the case with the states originating from the 3d or 4f orbitals .",

    "similarly for the case when @xmath79 is unoccupied .",
    "thus we see that by removing the self - screening terms from the direct self - energy we effectively include the exchange self - energy .",
