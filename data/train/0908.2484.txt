    "the study of black holes in more than four spacetime dimensions is motivated by several reasons .",
    "strong motivation comes from developments in string / m - theory , which is believed to be the most consistent approach to quantum theory of gravity in higher dimensions .",
    "in fact , the first successful statistical counting of black hole entropy in string theory was performed for a five - dimensional black hole @xcite .",
    "this example provides the best laboratory for the microscopic string theory of black holes .",
    "besides , the production of higher - dimensional black holes in future colliders becomes a conceivable possibility in scenarios involving large extra dimensions and tev - scale gravity .",
    "furthermore , as mathematical objects , black hole spacetimes are among the most important lorentzian ricci - flat manifolds in any dimension .",
    "while the non - rotating black hole solution to the higher - dimensional einstein - maxwell gravity was found several decades ago @xcite , the counterpart of the kerr - newman solution in higher dimensions , that is , the charged generalization of the myers - perry solution @xcite in higher dimensional einstein - maxwell theory , still remains to be found analytically .",
    "indeed , the case of charged rotating black holes in higher dimensions has been discussed in the framework of supergravity theories and string theory @xcite .",
    "recently , charged rotating black hole solutions in higher dimensions with a single rotation parameter in the limit of slow rotation have been constructed in @xcite ( see also ) .    on the other hand",
    ", a scalar field called dilaton appears in the low energy limit of string theory .",
    "the presence of the dilaton field has important consequences on the causal structure and the thermodynamic properties of black holes .",
    "thus , much interest has been focused on the study of the dilaton black holes in recent years . while exact dilaton black hole solutions of einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) gravity have been constructed by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "exact rotating dilaton black hole solutions have been obtained only for some limited values of the dilaton coupling constant @xcite . for the general dilaton coupling constant , the properties of charged rotating dilaton black holes only with infinitesimally small charge @xcite or small angular momentum in four @xcite and five dimensions",
    "have been investigated @xcite .",
    "recently , charged slowly rotating dilaton black hole solutions in the background of ads spaces have also been constructed in arbitrary dimensions @xcite .",
    "most authors have considered mainly asymptotically flat and stationary higher dimensional black hole solutions since they would be idealized models if such black holes are small enough for us to neglect the tension of a brane or effects of compactness of extra dimensions .",
    "however , if not so , we should consider the higher dimensional spacetimes which have another asymptotic structure .",
    "therefore , it is also important to study black hole solutions with a wide class of asymptotic structures .",
    "recently , the black object solutions with non - trivial asymptotic structures have been studied by various authors .",
    "for example , squashed kaluza - klein black hole solutions @xcite asymptote to the locally flat spacetime , i.e. , a twisted @xmath1 fiber bundle over the four - dimensional minkowski spacetime . in other words ,",
    "the spacetime is effectively four - dimensional at the infinity .",
    "the black ring solutions with the same asymptotic structures were also found @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , charged kaluza - klein dilaton black holes with asymptotically locally flat structures have been constructed in the static case only @xcite . in the present work",
    "we would like to generalize such static dilaton black holes to the rotating ones .",
    "we also investigate the properties of these rotating black holes related to the presence of the dilaton field and the difference of the asymptotic structures .",
    "especially , we want to construct a new class of charged rotating squashed kaluza - klein black hole solutions in five - dimensional emd gravity . we shall also study the properties of the solutions in the various limits .",
    "finally , we investigate the effects of the dilaton field and the twisted compact extra dimension on the angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of these rotating black holes .",
    "we consider five - dimensional emd theory with action @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scalar curvature , @xmath4 is the dilaton field , @xmath5 is the electromagnetic field tensor , and @xmath6 is the electromagnetic potential .",
    "@xmath7 is an arbitrary constant governing the strength of the coupling between the dilaton and the maxwell field .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ act1 ] ) is the gibbons - hawking boundary term which is chosen such that the variational principle is well - defined .",
    "the manifold @xmath8 has metric @xmath9 and covariant derivative @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath12 of any boundary @xmath13 of the manifold @xmath14 , with induced metric @xmath15 .",
    "the equations of motion can be obtained by varying the action ( [ act1 ] ) with respect to the gravitational field @xmath16 , the dilaton field @xmath17 and the gauge field @xmath6 which yields the following field equations @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 we would like to find rotating solutions of the above field equations . for small rotation , we can solve eqs.([fe1])-([fe3 ] ) to the first order in the angular momentum parameter @xmath21 .",
    "inspection of the slowly rotating black hole solutions @xcite shows that the only terms in the metric that change to the first order of the angular momentum parameter @xmath21 are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the dilaton field does not change to @xmath24 and , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the only components of the vector potential that change .",
    "therefore , for an infinitesimal angular momentum , we assume the metric , the gauge potential and the dilaton field being of the following forms @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 denotes the metric of the unit two - sphere , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constants .",

    ", we are looking for the asymptotically locally flat solutions in the case @xmath40 .",
    "our strategy for obtaining the solution is the perturbative method proposed by horne and horowitz @xcite . for small @xmath21",
    ", we can expect to have solutions with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 still functions of @xmath41 alone .",
    "inserting metric ( [ metric1 ] ) , the gauge potential ( [ a1 ] ) and the dilaton field ( [ phi1 ] ) into the field equations ( [ fe1])-([fe3 ] ) , one can show that the static part of the metric leads to the following solutions @xcite @xmath42 @xmath43 ^{\\frac{4}{4 + 3\\alpha^2 } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath44 @xmath45 while the rotating part of the metric admits a solution @xmath46 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coordinates @xmath47 run the ranges of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",

    "the black hole horizon is located at @xmath54 .",
    "the induced metric on the three - dimensional spatial cross section of the black hole horizon with the time slice is obtained as @xmath55^\\frac{8}{4 + 3\\alpha^2 } \\frac{r_+ ^2}{4 } \\left [ k(r_+ ) d\\omega_{s^{2}}^2 + \\sigma_{3}^2 \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies the shape of horizon is the squashed @xmath56 , a twisted @xmath57 fiber bundle over an @xmath58 base space with the different sizes .",
    "we see that the function @xmath37 causes the deformation of the black hole horizon .",
