    "direct - production of two hard photons in nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath9 ) at intermediate energies , unlike production of single photons ( @xmath10 bremsstrahlung ) , belongs to those fundamental processes which are still poorly explored both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "however , a study of this process can provide us with new important information on the underlying mechanisms of the @xmath10 interaction that is complementary to that obtained from investigations of other processes .",
    "in particular , the @xmath9 process can be used as a sensitive probe for experimental verification of the possible existence of @xmath10-decoupled nonstrange dibaryon resonances .",
    "these are two - baryon states @xmath11 with zero strangeness and exotic quantum numbers , for which the strong decay @xmath12 is either strictly forbidden by the pauli principle ( for the states with the isospin @xmath13 and with an even sum @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the orbital momentum and @xmath16 is the spin ) , or is strongly suppressed by the isospin selection rules ( for the states with @xmath17)@xcite .",
    "such dibaryon states can not be simple bound systems of two color - singlet nucleons , and a proof of their existence would have consequences of fundamental significance for the theory of strong interactions . the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon states are predicted in a series of @xmath18-inspired models@xcite . among the predicted dibaryons ,",
    "there are those whith masses both below and above the pion production ( @xmath19 ) threshold .",
    "the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryons with masses below the @xmath19 threshold are of special interest , since they may decay mainly into the @xmath20 state , and consequently , their widths should be very narrow(@xmath21 ) .",
    "narrow dibaryon states have been searched for in a number of experiments@xcite , but none has provided any undoubted evidence for their existence . most of the past searches , however , were limited to dibaryons coupled to the @xmath10 channel , and , to our knowledge , only a few ones were dedicated to the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryons@xcite . at the same time , since the latter do not couple to the @xmath10-channel , then , depending on their production and decay modes , they may have escaped detection up to now and may naturally appear in dedicated experiments .",
    "+ if the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryons exist in nature , then the @xmath9 process may proceed , at least partly , through the mechanism that directly involves the radiative excitation @xmath22 and decay @xmath23 modes of these states . in @xmath10 collisions at energies below the @xmath19 threshold ,",
    "these production and decay modes of the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonances with masses @xmath24 would be unique or dominant .",
    "the simplest and clear way of revealing them is to measure the photon energy spectrum of the reaction @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of an @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonance would reveal itself in this energy spectrum as a narrow line associated with the formation of this resonance and a relatively broad peak originating from its three - particle decay . in the center - of - mass system , the position of the narrow line(@xmath25 )",
    "is determined by the energy of colliding nucleons ( @xmath26 ) and the mass of this dibaryon resonance as @xmath27 .",
    "an essential feature of the two - photon production in @xmath10 collisions at an energy below the @xmath19 threshold is that , apart from the resonant mechanism in question , there should only be one more source of photon pairs .",
    "this is the double @xmath10-bremsstrahlung reaction . but",
    "this reaction is expected to play a minor role .",
    "indeed , it involves two electromagnetic vertices , so that one may expect that the @xmath9-to-@xmath20 cross section ratio should be of the order the fine structure constant @xmath28 .",
    "however , the cross section for @xmath20 is already small ( for example , the total @xmath29-bremsstrahlung cross section at energies of interest is a few @xmath30 ) .",
    "+ the process @xmath31 at an energy below the @xmath19 threshold provides an unique possibility of searching for the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonances in the mass region @xmath32 with quantum numbers @xmath33 ) or those with @xmath17 ( @xmath34 is the total spin , and @xmath35 is the parity of a dibaryon ) .",
    "the preliminary experimental studies of the reaction @xmath36 at an incident proton energy of about 200 mev@xcite showed that the photon energy spectrum of this reaction had a peculiar structure ranging from about 20 mev to about 60 mev .",
    "this structure was interpreted as an indication of the possible existence of an @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonance(later called @xmath6 ) that is produced in the process @xmath7 and subsequently decays via the @xmath8 channel .",
    "unfortunately , a relatively coarse energy resolution and low statistics did not allow us to distinguish the narrow @xmath0-peak associated with the @xmath6 production from the broad @xmath0-peak due to the decay of this resonance and , hence , to determine the resonance mass exactly . to get a rough estimate of the @xmath6 mass",
    ", we admitted that the expected narrow @xmath0-peak is positioned at the center of the observed structure and thus obtained @xmath37 mev .",
    "however , if the uncertainty in the position of the narrow @xmath0-peak in the structure is taken into account , the actual @xmath6 mass might be considerably different from such a crude estimate .",
    "the possible existence of this dibaryon resonance was also probed in the proton - proton bremsstrahlung data taken by the wasa / promice collaboration at the celsius accelerator@xcite for proton energies of 200 and 310 mev .",
    "however , the trigger used in those experimental studies to select events was designed and optimized for investigating the usual @xmath38 bremsstrahlung .",
    "the selected events were those corresponding to two simultaneously detected protons emerging in the forward direction at angles between @xmath39 and @xmath40 with respect to the beam axis , each of which had a kinetic energy exceeding the present threshold ( 40 mev ) .",
    "the analysis of those data resulted only in upper limits on the dibaryon production cross section in the mass range from 1900 to 1960 mev .",
    "therefore , to clarify the situation with the dibaryon resonance @xmath6 , we have decided to measure the energy spectrum of the @xmath41 reaction more carefully .",
    "the experiment was performed using the variable energy proton beam from the phasotron at the joint institute for nuclear research(jinr ) . the schematic layout of the experimental setup is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the pulsed proton beam ( bursts of about 7 ns fwhm separated by 70 ns ) with an energy of about 216 mev and an energy spread of about 1.5% bombarded a liquid hydrogen target ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the average beam intensity was on the order of @xmath43 protons / s and was monitored by an ionization chamber ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the liquid hydrogen target was a cylindrical cryogenic vessel with a length of about 5 cm ( @xmath45 ) and a diameter of 4.5 , cm which had thin entrance and exit windows made from 100 @xmath46 thick mylar foil .",
    "both @xmath0-quanta of the reaction @xmath47 were detected by two @xmath0-ray detectors(@xmath48 and @xmath49 ) placed in a horizontal plane , symmetrically on either side of the beam at a laboratory angle of @xmath3 with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the @xmath0-detector @xmath48 was an array of seven individual detector modules ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : the central detector module ( @xmath50 ) and six detector modules ( @xmath51 ) surrounding the central detector module . each detector module was a 15 cm thick @xmath52 crystal having a hexagonal cross section with an outer diameter of 10 cm .",
    "the detector modules @xmath53 ( ring ) were designed to measure the energy of secondary particles and photons leaving the central detector module @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the energy of each photon detected by the detector @xmath48 was determined by summing up the energy deposited in the central detector module and the energies deposited in the detector modules of the ring . besides , the ring was used as an active shielding from cosmic ray muons .",
    "the energy resolution of a single @xmath52 crystal was measured to be about 13% for @xmath54 mev .",
    "the second @xmath0-ray detector @xmath49 was a cylindrical @xmath55 crystal 15 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length . compared to the detector @xmath48",
    ", it had a poorer energy resolution for @xmath0-rays with energies @xmath56 mev .",
    "the detector @xmath49 was mainly designed to select @xmath4 coincidence events . to reject events induced by charged particles , plastic scintillators ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) were put in front of each @xmath0-detector .",
    "both @xmath0-ray detectors were placed in lead houses with walls 10 cm thick which were in turn surrounded by a 5 cm borated parafin shield .",
    "the solid angles covered by the detectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 were 43 msr and 76 msr , respectively . to attenuate prompt particles coming from the target , 15 cm polyethylene bars ( pb ) were placed in between the target and each @xmath0-detector .",
    "+ the electronics associated with the @xmath0-detectors and the plastic scintillators provided amplitude and time signals suitable for digitizing by an @xmath59 and a @xmath60 .",
    "the data acquisition system was triggered by the time signal from the detector module @xmath50 which started all the @xmath61 and opened the @xmath59 gates . in parallel ,",
    "the time signals from the detector module @xmath50 and the @xmath0-detector @xmath49 were sent to a coincidence circuit to select those events which had signals from both the @xmath0-detectors .",
    "events satisfying this criterion were recorded in the event - by - event mode on the hard disk of the computer .",
    "a further selection of @xmath4 coincidence candidate events was done during off - line data processing .    the off - line selection procedure for events associated with the process @xmath62 included the following main operations : rejection of events induced by charge particles coming from the target , rejection of events induced by cosmic ray muons , selection of events which are caused by proton beam bursts and selection of events associated with @xmath4 coincidences .",
    "the measurements were performed both with the target filled with liquid hydrogen and with the empty one .",
    "data for the full and empty targets were taken in two successive runs for @xmath6331 h and @xmath6321 h , respectively .",
    "the integrated luminosity of about @xmath64 was accumulated for the measurement with the full target . the resulting number of @xmath4 coincidence events associated with the @xmath62 process as a function of the photon energy measured by the detector @xmath48 is presented in fig .",
    "2 . as can be seen , the energy spectrum of the reaction @xmath62 consists of a narrow peak at a photon energy of about 24 mev and a relatively broad peak in the energy range from about 50 to about 70 mev .",
    "it was found that the statistical significance for the sharp peak as well as for the broad one exceeds 5@xmath5 .",
    "the width ( fwhm ) of the narrow peak was found to be about 8 mev .",
    "this width is comparable with that of the energy resolution of the experimental setup .",
    "the observed behavior of the photon energy spectrum agrees with a characteristic signature of the sought dibaryon resonance @xmath6 that is formed and decays in the radiative process @xmath65 . in that case",
    "the narrow peak should be attributed to the formation of this dibaryon , while the broad peak should be assigned to its three - particle decay . using the value for the energy of the narrow peak @xmath66 mev",
    ", we obtained the @xmath6 mass @xmath67 mev .",
    "having assumed that the @xmath68 process with the @xmath6 mass of 1956 mev is the only mechanism of the reaction @xmath69 , we calculated the photon energy spectra of this reaction for a proton energy of 216 mev .",
    "it was also assumed that the radiative decay of the @xmath6 is a dipole @xmath70 transition from the two - baryon resonance state to a @xmath29-state in the continuum .",
    "the calculations were carried out with the help of monte carlo simulations which included the geometry and the energy resolution of the actual experimental setup .",
    "the photon energy spectra were calculated for two different scenarios of the @xmath6 decay .",
    "the difference between them was that one of these scenarios took into account the final state interaction ( @xmath71 ) of two outgoing protons whereas in the other that interaction was switched off .",
    "each of the scenarios imposed some restrictions on possible quantum numbers of the dibaryon state in question .",
    "the scenario including the @xmath71 implies that the final @xmath29-system is in the singlet @xmath72 state and consequently it should take place , in particular , for the isovector @xmath73 dibaryon state ( the simplest exotic quantum numbers ) , namely , @xmath74 . at the same time , the scenario in which the @xmath71 is switched off , is most likely to occur for the isotensor @xmath75 dibaryon state .",
    "the spectra calculated for these two decay scenarios and normalized to the total number of @xmath4 events observed in the present experiment are shown in fig .",
    "2 .        comparison of these spectra with the experimental spectrum indicates that both the calculated spectra are in reasonable agreement with the experimental one within experimental uncertainties .",
    "however , one can see that the energy spectrum for the scenario that can be realized for the isotensor dibaryon(@xmath17 ) is more consistent with the experimental spectrum . at the same time , the statistics of the experiment is insufficient to draw any firm conclusions in favor of one of these scenarios , that is , in favor of either @xmath76 or @xmath17 for the isospin of @xmath6 . in this connection",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the experimental data on the process @xmath77 can shed some light on the properties of the dibaryon state we have observed .",
    "the point is that the @xmath6 dibaryon can in principle be excited in this process via the mode @xmath78 .",
    "however , excitation of the dibaryon @xmath79 with isospin @xmath76 is allowed by the isospin selection rules , whereas excitation of the isotensor @xmath80 resonance is expected to be strongly suppressed@xcite .",
    "therefore , the preliminary results of the study of the reaction @xmath77 carried out by the rmc collaboration at triumf@xcite indicating no enhancement of the two - photon yield in the process @xmath81 compared to the usual one - nucleon mechanism @xmath82 on the proton bound in the deuteron may imply that the @xmath79 dibaryon has isospin 2 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray energy spectrum for the @xmath62 reaction at a proton energy below the pion production threshold has been measured for the first time . the spectrum measured at an energy of about 216 mev for coincident photons emitted at an angle of @xmath3 in the laboratory frame clearly evidences the existence of the @xmath10-decoupled dibaryon resonance @xmath6 with a mass of about 1956 mev that is formed and decays in the process @xmath65 .",
    "the data we have obtained , however , are still incomplete , and additional careful studies of the reaction @xmath83 are needed to get proper parameters ( mass , width , spin , etc . ) of the observed dibaryon state",
