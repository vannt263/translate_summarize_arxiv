    "evidence has been mounting in recent years that turbulence plays an important role in determining the physical conditions of the neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) as well as generating the hierarchy of structures seen in it ( see @xcite ; @xcite , for recent reviews ) .",
    "observational evidence includes the fact that the fluctuation power spectrum of a variety of tracers ( hi 21-cm emission intensity , hi 21-cm optical depth , dust and molecular emission ) is a scale - free power - law ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this scale - free behavior is characteristic of a turbulent medium .",
    "similarly , the hi distribution in several dwarf galaxies in the m81 group appears to be fractal ( @xcite ) .",
    "further , the fourier transform power spectra of the v and h@xmath6 images of a sample of irregular galaxies are also found to be a power law , indicating that there is no characteristic mass or luminosity scale for ob associations and star complexes ( willett et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "recently @xcite have presented a visibility based formalism for determining the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuations in galaxies with extremely weak emission .",
    "this was applied to the dwarf galaxy ddo  210 and the power spectrum was found to be a power law with slope @xmath7 over the length scales @xmath8 pc . in a subsequent paper , we @xcite have applied the same formalism to an external disk galaxy ngc  628 ( m  74 ) and found the slope to be @xmath9 over the length scales @xmath10 kpc .",
    "this is significantly shallower than the power spectra in earlier measurements including our galaxy , the smc and ddo 210 , all of which exhibit a slope roughly in the range @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the shallower slope observed in ngc  628 was interpreted as arising from two dimensional ( 2d ) turbulence in the plane of the galaxy s disk on length - scales larger than the galaxy s scale - height . the steeper slope seen in the other galaxies",
    "was ascribed to three dimensional ( 3d ) turbulence at small length - scales .",
    "we expect a transition from 3d to 2d turbulence at a length - scale corresponding to the galaxy s scale height .",
    "an observational detection of this transition provides a method to estimate the scale - height of face - on galaxies @xcite , a quantity which is otherwise difficult to measure .",
    "ngc  1058 is an almost face - on , type sc , spiral galaxy with an inclination angle in the range @xmath13 to @xmath14 @xcite . in this letter",
    "we use a break in the observed hi power spectrum to determine the galaxy s scale - height .",
    "the distance to this galaxy is uncertain with previous estimates ranging from @xmath15 @xcite to @xmath16 @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a distance of 10 mpc for ngc  1058 . at this distance 1@xmath17",
    "corresponds to 48.5 pc .",
    "we have used archival hi data of ngc  1058 from the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the observations had been carried out on 14@xmath18 june 1993 in the c configurations of the vla .",
    "the data was downloaded from the vla archive and reduced in the usual way using standard tasks in classic aips .",
    "the hi emission from ngc  1058 spans 24 channels ( i.e , channel 53 to channel 76 ) of the 127 channel spectral cube .",
    "we have used only the central @xmath19 channels ( i.e , channel 57 to channel 72 ) with relatively strong hi emission .",
    "the frequency width of each channel corresponds to @xmath20 .",
    "the continuum from the galaxy was subtracted from the data in the _ uv _ plane using the aips task uvsub . the resulting continuum subtracted data",
    "was used for the subsequent analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : mom0 ] shows a total hi column density ( moment 0 ) map of ngc  1058 made from this data . the hi disk of the galaxy is nearly face - on .",
    "the angular extent of the hi distribution in figure [ fig : mom0 ] is measured to be @xmath21 at a column density of @xmath22 , which is @xmath23 times it s holmberg diameter @xcite .    [",
    "figure : f2 ]    @xcite and @xcite contains a detailed discussion of the visibility based hi power spectrum estimator @xmath24 , hence we present only a brief discussion here . here",
    "@xmath25 refers to a baseline , the antenna separation projected in the plane perpendicular to the direction of observation , measured in units of the observing wavelength @xmath26 . note that , @xmath25 expressed this way is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "it is common practice to express @xmath25 in units of kilo wavelength ( k@xmath26 ) .",
    "every visibility @xmath27 is correlated with all other visibilities @xmath28 within a disk @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the angular extent of the galaxy .",
    "the correlations are averaged over different @xmath25 directions assuming that the signal is statistically isotropic in the plane of the galaxy s image . to increase the signal to noise ratio we further average the correlations in bins of @xmath31 and over all frequency channels with hi emission .",
    "the expectation value of the estimator @xmath32 is real , and it is the convolution of the hi power spectrum @xmath33 with a window function @xmath34 .",
    "the window function quantifies the effect of the large - scale hi distribution and the finite angular extent of the galaxy , and it can be assumed to be sharply peaked around @xmath35 with a width of order @xmath36 . at baselines @xmath37 the function @xmath34 is well approximated by a dirac delta function and the expectation value of @xmath38 gives an estimate of the hi power spectrum @xmath39 .",
    "the effect of @xmath34 in estimating the power spectrum and the considerations for determining @xmath40 is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath41 error - bars for the estimated power spectrum is a sum , in quadrature , of contributions from two sources of uncertainty . at small @xmath31",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the sample variance which comes from the fact that we have a finite and limited number of independent estimates of the true power spectrum . at large @xmath31 ,",
    "it is dominated by the system noise in each visibility .    to determine",
    "if the slope of the hi power spectrum changes with the width of the frequency channel , we have combined @xmath42 successive channels to obtain a data set with @xmath43 channels of width @xmath44 each .",
    "we have determined the hi power spectrum for a range of @xmath42 values .",
    "figure [ figure : f2 ] shows the real and imaginary parts of @xmath33 , which is the observed value of the estimator @xmath45 . as expected from the theoretical considerations ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the imaginary part is well suppressed compared to the real part . to test for a possible contribution from residual continuum",
    ", we also show the real part of @xmath33 estimated using line free channels .",
    "this is found to be much smaller than the signal .",
    "for the channels with hi emission , the observed @xmath33 may be directly interpreted as the hi power spectrum at @xmath31 values that are considerably larger than @xmath46 .",
    "the power spectrum is well fitted by two different power laws @xmath0 , one with @xmath3 for @xmath47 to @xmath48 ( large length - scales ) and another with @xmath1 for @xmath49 to @xmath50 ( small length scales ) .",
    "the results are tabulated in table  [ table : t1 ] .",
    "the best - fit power - law were determined by a @xmath51 minimization with respect to the amplitude , a and the power - law index , @xmath6 ( @xcite ) . the @xmath41 error - bar on @xmath6 , the parameter of interest here ,",
    "is determined by projecting the ellipse corresponding to @xmath52 onto the @xmath6 axis in the @xmath53 parameter space ( page 694 of @xcite ) .",
    "both hi density fluctuations as well as spatial fluctuations in the velocity of the hi gas contribute to fluctuations in the hi specific intensity . considering a turbulent ism , @xcite have shown that it is possible to disentangle these two contributions by studying the behavior of the hi power spectrum as the thickness of the frequency channel is varied . the slope of the hi power spectrum is expected to change with the frequency channel thickness if it is due to the gas velocities , however , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite do not find this change for any of the galaxies in their sample of spiral and dwarf galaxies .",
    "further , @xcite also reported a similar behavior for lmc .",
    "we find that the hi power spectrum of ngc  1058 does not exhibit a statistically significant change with increase of the channel thickness ( table [ table : t1 ] ) , indicating that the observed power spectrum is due to hi density fluctuations .    .ngc",
    "1058 power spectrum are well fitted by two power laws of @xmath54 in two different baseline ranges .",
    "this table summaries the result for different channel width . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a baseline @xmath31 corresponds to an angular scale of @xmath55 in the plane of the sky . in the subsequent discussion ,",
    "we use @xmath56 ( distance to the galaxy ) to convert the baseline @xmath31 to a length - scale @xmath57 in the plane of the galaxy s image .",
    "we find that the slope of the power spectrum of ngc  1058 is @xmath1 at small length - scales ( @xmath58 ) whereas it is @xmath59 at large length - scales ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the largest length - scale ( @xmath61 ) is definitely larger than the typical hi scale heights within the milky - way @xcite and in external spiral galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is then quite reasonable to conclude that the slope @xmath59 is that of 2d turbulence in the plane of the galaxy s disk .",
    "simulations of the power spectrum of hi emission from a face - on disk galaxy @xcite predict a change in the slope @xmath6 corresponding to a transition from 2d to 3d turbulence .",
    "this is expected to occur at a baseline @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the galaxy s scale - height . interpreting the change in the slope of the observed power spectrum seen at @xmath64 as the transition from 2d to 3d turbulence",
    ", we find the scale - heigth of ngc  1058 to be @xmath65 .",
    "further , we interpret the slope of @xmath1 to be that of 3d turbulence . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first observational determination of the scale - height of a nearly face on spiral galaxy through its hi power spectrum .",
    "the width of the bin @xmath66 , corresponding to the baseline where the break occurs , gives an estimate of the uncertainty in the estimated scale - height as @xmath67 , whereby we have @xmath68 .",
    "@xcite present hi images of a large sample of edge on intermediate to late type spirals ; from their data the ratio of the hi disk height to the radius of the hi disk ( at a column density of 1@xmath69pc@xmath70 ) is @xmath71 .",
    "since the disk of ngc  1058 has a diameter of @xmath72 ( figure [ fig : mom0 ] ) at this column density , we expect it s scale - height to be @xmath73 , in excess of our result .",
    "note that the hi scale - height is known to increase with the distance from the center , and our result is an average value over the entire disk with possibly a larger contribution from the inner parts where the emission is strongest .",
    "a similar behavior of a change in the slope of the power spectrum at larger length scales has been also observed in lmc ( elmegreen et al .",
    "the hi power spectrum of the lmc flattens at large length - scales , which was interpreted as a transition from three - dimensional to two - dimensional turbulence . using this method the scale - height of lmc",
    "was found to be 100 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) that the slope of the velocity power spectrum changes by unity from @xmath74 to @xmath75 in going from 3d to 2d for incompressible kolmogorov turbulence @xcite .",
    "this may be related to the change in slope from @xmath11 to @xmath76 measured in ngc  1058 , though the turbulence here is compressible and the observations are those of density fluctuations and not the velocity .",
    "the relation between the power spectrum of density fluctuations and the velocity power spectrum is not very clear for compressible turbulence .",
    "there is now mounting evidence that spiral galaxies exhibit scale - invariant density fluctuations that extend to length - scales of @xmath77 ( eg . ngc  628 , ngc  1058 ) which is comparable to the diameter of the hi disk . while a large variety of possible energy sources like proto - stellar winds , supernovae , shocks , etc .",
    "have been proposed to drive turbulence @xcite , it is still to be seen whether these are effective on length - scales as large as @xmath61 .",
    "it is interesting to note that a break in the power spectrum , like the one seen here for ngc  1058 , has also been observed in the shell - type supernovae remnant cassiopeia  a @xcite .",
    "the slope of the power spectrum changes from @xmath78 at @xmath79 ( large length - scales ) to @xmath80 at @xmath81 ( short length - scales ) .",
    "this change in the slope is interpreted as a transition from 2d to 3d magneto hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the transition occurs at a length - scale of @xmath82 which corresponds to the thickness of the shell .",
