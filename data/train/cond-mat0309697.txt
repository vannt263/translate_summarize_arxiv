    "there have been considerable interests in a single - electron transistor because of its potential applications . since coulomb blockade peaks in its conductance oscillation",

    "al._@xcite developed a high sensitive single - electron transistor . by introducing a @xmath0-resonant circuit connected to a single - electron transistor , they drove the system in the radio - frequency regime to overcome @xmath1 noise and obtain a high sensitity of detecting charges .    from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "such a single - electron transistor is also very interesting because one should consider the influence of dissipative environments(@xmath0-resonant circuit with a cable resistance ) on current - voltage characteristics as well as effects of time - dependent external perturbations . in the presence of the dissipative environments , tunneling rates of quasiparticles",
    "are strongly affected because an additional energy is needed to excite the environments as shown in the case of single- and multi - junctions@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "time - dependent perturbations affect phase coherence of quasiparticles in time and its effects manifest itself in photon - assisted tunneling ; quasiparticles are also able to tunnel by absorbing or emitting photons@xcite .",
    "thus , quasiparticles in the single - electron transistor have two different energy - exchange mechanisms when they tunnel through junctions and then , one should take into account these two mechanisms in calculating the tunneling rates simultaneously .    in this work",
    "we investigate effects of the dissipative environments and the time - dependent perturbations on current - voltage characteristics of a single - electron transistor by calculating the tunneling rate and present expressions for currents at each electrode .",
    "in calculating the tunneling rate we make two assumptions for our model of the single - electron transistor .",
    "firstly , tunneling barriers are considered so opaque that quasiparticles in each electrode are well localized there and their motions can be described by separated hamiltonians . in other word , the tunneling barriers have a resistance much larger than the resistance quantum @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , it is assumed that time between successive tunneling events is much larger than the charge relaxation time of the dissipative environments .",
    "this assumption makes the problem easy to treat the dissipative environments as heat reservoirs being in thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , we still treat quasiparticles confined in the region of a quantum dot as in non - equilibrium .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the hamiltonian of the single - electron transistor in section ii . by expressing the dissipative environments in terms of driven harmonic oscillators ,",
    "we give the hamiltonian separating it into an interested system part and its environment , and derive time- and environment - dependent tunneling rates using a reduced - density operator method . in section iii",

    "tunneling currents driven by a simple dissipative circuit are examined in section iv , and then , a brief summary is given in section v.",
    "in fig . 1 , we show a typical drawing of the single electron transistor driven by time - dependent voltages via possible dissipative elements .",
    "the hamiltonian of the entire system is modeled by @xmath3 where the first two terms describe the motion of the system in the absence of tunnelings and the last one is the tunneling hamiltonian . in the absence of tunneling",
    ", the system is viewed as just a simple electronic circuit(a lumped - circuit ) because all tunneling junctions are considered as capacitors .",

    "we plot the probability density of @xmath239 at the drain in ( a ) and corresponding particle - distribution function @xmath243 in ( b ) for @xmath241(dotted lines ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5k@xmath244(solid lines ) when there are no alternating perturbations . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]      as a simple example , we consider two degenerate states(@xmath245 ) in the quantum dot and , therefore , two possible many - body states with energies of @xmath246 are available for tunneling . in the static case ,",
    "we obtain typical @xmath219 curves ; step - like behavior and coulomb blockade oscillations as a function of drain and gate voltages , respectively , for @xmath241 as shown in fig .",
    "5(dashed lines ) . under the dissipative environments(@xmath247 ) , the shape of the @xmath219 curves are found to be smeared out due to the depletion of the particle(hole ) distribution functions(not shown in fig .",
    "the smearing of the tunneling currents is also found for the case of time - dependent fields .",
    "applying an alternating perturbation , fine structures in tunneling currents are developed because energy levels in the quantum dot are split into photon - side bands , @xmath248 ( @xmath249integer ) .",
    "these split energy levels are well identified in a dc part of the tunneling current as a function of additional static drain voltages , especially in the case of @xmath241(dotted line in fig .",
    "namely , each step appears at the voltage which gives the chemical potential of the drain corresponding to one of energy levels , @xmath248 . under the dissipative environments ,",
    "this step - like behavior is washed out as well as the height of the steps is reduced as @xmath214 increases as shown in fig .",
    "5-(a)(solid lines ) .",
    "different from the static case , the reduction of the tunneling currents can be caused by the decrease of voltage differences across tunneling barriers as well as the depletion of the particle distributions described by eqs .",
    "( [ role1 ] ) and ( [ role2 ] ) , respectively . however , the results of fig .",
    "5 are mostly responsible for the latter effect of the environment in this numerical simulation because the cut - off frequency of @xmath250 is still much larger than the applied frequency @xmath180 even for @xmath251k@xmath244 .",
    "thus , we find that the tunneling currents are smeared out nearly by the same amount in both static and time - dependent cases as @xmath214 increases .    for various values of @xmath214 , we also examine a dc part of the tunneling current as a function of a static gate voltage @xmath252 with a static drain voltage being zero , and plot the results in fig .",
    "instead of a coulomb blockade peak in the static case(dashed line ) , it is found that the tunneling currents have negative or positive values depending on the gate voltages , and the direction is abruptly altered around the peak position .",
    "this behavior is retained for lower frequencies of the alternating perturbation , even in adiabatic limit . in reality , the direction of the tunneling currents is easily inferred because the voltage difference across the tunneling junction to the source is mainly determined by the gate voltage as mentioned in the previous section . in the region of the negative(positive )",
    "tunneling currents , the chemical potential of the source is lower(higher ) than an energy of a relevant quantum state in the dot and , therefore , electrons tunnel from(to ) the quantum dot through the barrier connected to the source , and vice versa .",
    "similar to the results as a function of a static drain voltage in fig 5-(a ) , photon - side bands are manifested itself in steps apart from each other by @xmath253 .",
    "we find that these steps are well resolved in the case of @xmath241 while they are relatively washed out as @xmath214 increases .    for valid applications of the time - convolutionless formalism we also calculate tunneling currents for the circuit of fig . 3 based on eqs . ( [ lessp ] ) and ( [ lessi ] )",
    ". by varying parameters within small tunneling rates",
    ", it is found that the time - convolutionless formalism give negligible differences from results obtained by the time - convolution forms .     when an alternating field is applied with @xmath254 and @xmath255 , the dc part of the tunneling currents(in units of @xmath256 ) at the drain are plotted as a function of a static drain voltage @xmath257 in ( a ) with @xmath258 and as a function of a static gate voltage @xmath252 in ( b ) with @xmath259 . here",
    ", the thicker solid line describes the result for a larger resistance of @xmath260 , and @xmath261k@xmath244 , respectively , with the dotted line for @xmath241 .",
    "the step designated by @xmath262 is resulted from a photon - side band @xmath263 . for a comparison ,",
    "the results without the alternating field are shown in both graphs with dashed lines for @xmath241 where @xmath264 is used in ( b ) .",

    "in summary , we have studied time - dependent currents of the single - electron transistor embedded in possible dissipative circuits and driven by time - dependent perturbations . in the regime of sequential tunneling",
    ", we present numerically tractable forms for both displacement and tunneling currents where the tunneling rates of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) contain explicitly the influence of the dissipative environments and time - dependent perturbations .",
    "we find that the dissipative environments affect tunneling currents of the single - electron transistor in two ways ; the determination of driving voltages at tunneling junctions and the depletion of particle - hole distribution functions at each electrode .",
    "applying our formalism to a simple dissipative system and solving the problem numerically , we show how steps in tunneling currents developed by photon - side bands are smeared out as the system becomes more dissipative .",
