    "if one assumes that the graviton background exists with the planckian spectrum and an effective temperature @xmath0 , which we will consider in a flat space - time , an energy of any photon decreases with a distance @xmath1 so a redshift @xmath2 is equal to @xcite : @xmath3 here @xmath4 where the hubble constant @xmath5 @xmath6 is an average graviton energy , @xmath7 is the stephan - boltzmann constant , @xmath8 is a new constant .",
    "it is necessary to have the following value of this constant : @xmath9 i.e. gravitons should be super - strong interacting particles . in this approach ,",
    "the newton constant @xmath10 is connected with @xmath11 that gives the following value of it @xcite : @xmath12 by @xmath13    additional photon flux s average energy losses on a way @xmath14 due to rejection of a part of photons from a source - observer direction should be proportional to @xmath15 where the relaxation factor @xmath16 is equal to : @xmath17 as it is shown in the next section .",
    "it is shown here how to find the value of relaxation factor @xmath16 which was used in author s paper @xcite .",
    "let us assume that by non - forehead collisions of a graviton with a photon , the latter leaves a photon flux detected by a remote observer ( an assumption of narrow beam of rays ) .",
    "so as both particles have velocities @xmath18 a cross - section of interaction , which is `` visible '' under an angle @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , will be equal to @xmath20 if @xmath21 is a cross - section by forehead collisions . the function @xmath22 allows to take into account both front and back hemispheres for riding gravitons .",
    "additionally , a graviton flux , which falls on a picked out area ( cross - section ) , depends on the angle @xmath23 we have for the ratio of fluxes : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the fluxes which fall on @xmath21 under the angle @xmath19 and normally , @xmath27 is a square of side surface of a truncated cone with a base @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "= 12.98 cm    finally , we get for the factor @xmath28 @xmath29 by @xmath30 a formed cone contains self - intersections , and it is @xmath31 .",
    "by @xmath32 we have @xmath33 .",
    "after computation of simple integrals , we get : @xmath34",
    "this additional relaxation of any photonic flux due to non - forehead collisions of gravitons with photons leads in this model to the luminosity distance @xmath35 @xmath36    = 12.98 cm    the model may be compared with supernova data by riess et al .",
    "@xcite if one introduces distance moduli @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant ( it is a single free parameter to fit the data ) ; @xmath39 is the luminosity distance in units of @xmath40 . in figure 2 , taken from my paper @xcite , the function @xmath41 is shown with @xmath42 to fit observations for low redshifts ; observational data are taken from table 5 of @xcite .",
    "the predictions fit observations very well for roughly @xmath43 . given this concordance between the theory _ without any kinematics _ and observations for low redshifts",
    ", we can think that any expansion of the universe _ is not necessary _ for higher redshifts , too .",
    "there are discrepancies between predicted and observed values of @xmath41 for higher @xmath2",
    ". it would be explained in the model as a result of deformation of sn spectra due to a discrete character of photon energy losses .",
    "today , a theory of this effect does not exist , and its origin may be explained only qualitatively @xcite .",
    "a main goal of any physical model is not to fit observational data but to understand them to have a possibility to build an adequate picture of the nature .",
    "there are a few facts - the pioneer 10 anomaly @xcite , an existence of redshifts and sne 1a specific dimming , - which may be explained from one point of view in the considered approach .",
    "this approach needs an existence of the graviton background with very unexpected properties . today , there is not any model in physics of particles dealing with _ an external sea of particles _ with a fixed spectrum .",
    "our understanding of cosmology , gravitational physics and physics of particles would be essentially changed if this background really exists .",
