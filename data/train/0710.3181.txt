    "superallowed @xmath1 nuclear @xmath2 decay currently provides the most precise value for @xmath9 , the up - down element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "this element is the key ingredient of the most demanding available test of ckm - matrix unitarity , a fundamental requirement of the electroweak standard model . to extract @xmath9 from the experimental data , small theoretical corrections  of order @xmath101% ",
    "must be applied to take account of unobserved radiative effects as well as the isospin symmetry - breaking that occurs between the analog parent and daughter states of each superallowed transition @xcite .",
    "even though these corrections are very small , experimental measurements have by now reached such high precision that the uncertainty on @xmath9 ( @xmath110.03% ) is currently dominated not by experiment but by the uncertainty on these theoretical corrections .    in the determination of @xmath9 , an important strength of the nuclear measurements",
    "is that there are many @xmath1 transitions available for study , and currently there are thirteen of them , ranging from @xmath12c to @xmath13rb , that have been measured with high precision . with so many , it becomes possible to validate the analysis procedure by checking that all transitions individually yield statistically consistent results for @xmath9 .",
    "since the isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections depend on nuclear structure , they differ from transition to transition and are particularly sensitive to this consistency test .",
    "thus the appearance of an anomalous result from any transition could signal a problem with the structure - dependent correction for that case , a problem which might have implications for other cases as well .    in the most recent survey of superallowed @xmath1 transitions , which appeared in 2005 @xcite , the results for all precisely measured cases ",
    "there were twelve at that time  were statistically consistent with one another . today",
    ", there are thirteen such cases and they still form a statistically consistent ensemble overall . however , recent precise penning - trap measurements @xcite of the @xmath14 value for the superallowed decay of @xmath7v have left the result for that transition more than two standard deviations away from the average of all other well - known transitions .",
    "this possible anomaly led us initially to reexamine the isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections for the @xmath7v transition , but what we learned from that reexamination prompted us to a more general reevaluation of the corrections for other transitions as well .    our previous shell - model calculations for @xmath7v considered six valence nucleons occupying the @xmath15-shell orbitals outside a @xmath16ca closed shell .",
    "this model space generated reasonable energies and spins for the known states in @xmath7ti , the daughter of @xmath7v .",
    "however , an important part of the charge - dependent correction depends on the radial mismatch between the decaying proton in the parent nucleus and the resulting neutron in the daughter nucleus ; but both these nucleons are bound to @xmath17ti , so the structure of that nucleus turns out to be important too .",
    "what is most striking about @xmath17ti is that it has a @xmath18 state at an excitation energy of only 330 kev , which is strongly populated in single - nucleon pick - up reactions like @xmath19 and ( @xmath20he,@xmath21 ) .",
    "such low - lying @xmath22-shell states can contribute to the structural parentage of the initial and final states of the superallowed transition and consequently must affect the radial mismatch between them .",
    "this indicated to us that a complete calculation of the isospin - symmetry - breaking correction for the decay of @xmath7v should include contributions from shells deeper than the @xmath15 shell .",
    "two questions then arose .",
    "how many deeper shells need to be included and , if this effect is important for @xmath7v decay , how many other transitions will be similarly affected ? in section [ s : isbc ] of this paper , we address these questions and settle on criteria for including deeper shells . using these criteria  and incorporating more recent effective interactions that have become available since our last work  we then re - evaluate the isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections for all transitions of relevance to the study of superallowed @xmath23 decay .",
    "for the cases with @xmath24 the changes in the corrections are very small  typically 0.03% ",
    "but for the heavier nuclei the changes can be as large as 0.2% .",
    "most significantly , with the new calculated corrections , the result for @xmath7v is no longer anomalous .    in section [ s : radc ] , we incorporate recent improvements made by marciano and sirlin @xcite to the calculation of the radiative corrections for superallowed decays and then in section [ s : ft ] we apply both types of corrections ",
    "isospin - symmetry - breaking and radiative  to the current experimental data for superallowed decays .",
    "the result for @xmath9 is changed appreciably , although it is still within quoted uncertainties of its old value , and the ckm - unitarity sum is improved .",
    "superallowed fermi beta decay between @xmath25 states depends uniquely on the vector part of the hadronic weak interaction .",
    "when it occurs between isospin @xmath26 analog states , the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis indicates that the @xmath27 values should be the same irrespective of the nucleus , _ viz . _ ft = =  const , [ ftconst ] where @xmath28 gev@xmath29s ; @xmath30 is the vector coupling constant for semi - leptonic weak interactions ; and @xmath31 is the fermi matrix element .",
    "the cvc hypothesis asserts that the vector coupling constant , @xmath32 , is a true constant and not renormalised to another value in the nuclear medium .    in practice , eq.([ftconst ] ) has to be amended slightly .",
    "firstly , there are radiative corrections because , for example , the emitted electron may emit a bremsstrahlung photon that goes undetected in the experiment .",
    "secondly , isospin is not an exact symmetry in nuclei so the nuclear matrix element , @xmath31 , is slightly reduced from its ideal value , leading us to write : |m_f|^2 = |m_0|^2 ( 1 - _ c ) , [ mf2 ] where @xmath33 is the exact - symmetry value , which for @xmath34 states is @xmath35 .",
    "thus , we define a  corrected \" @xmath6 value as t ft ( 1 + _ r ) ( 1 - _ c ) = =  const , [ ftconst ] where @xmath0 is the isospin - symmetry - breaking correction , @xmath36 is the transition - dependent part of the radiative correction , and @xmath4 is the transition - independent part .",
    "fortunately these corrections are all of order 1% but , even so , to maintain an accuracy criterion of 0.1% they must be calculated with an accuracy of 10% of their central value .",
    "this is a demanding request , especially for the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections .    to separate out those terms that are dependent on nuclear structure from those that are not",
    ", we split the transition - dependent radiative correction into two terms , _",
    "r = _ r^ + _ ns , [ dr ] of which the first , @xmath5 , is a function only of the electron s energy and the charge of the daughter nucleus @xmath37 ; it therefore depends on the particular nuclear decay , but is _ independent _ of nuclear structure .",
    "the second term , @xmath3 , like @xmath0 , depends in its evaluation on the details of nuclear structure . to emphasize the different sensitivities of the correction terms , we rewrite the expression for @xmath6 as t ft ( 1 + _",
    "r^ ) ( 1 + _ ns - _ c ) = , [ ftfactor ] where the first correction in brackets is independent of nuclear structure , while the second incorporates the structure - dependent terms .    from eq.([ftfactor ] ) it can be seen that a measurement of any one superallowed transition establishes a single value for @xmath32 ; moreover , measurements of many transitions provides an excellent test of the validity of the whole analysis . since cvc requires a unique value of @xmath32 , all the extracted @xmath6-values should be identical within experimental uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath27-value that characterizes any @xmath2-transition depends on three measured quantities : the total transition energy , @xmath14 ; the half - life , @xmath38 , of the parent state ; and the branching ratio , @xmath39 , for the particular transition of interest .",
    "the @xmath14-value is required to determine the statistical rate function , @xmath40 , while the half - life and branching ratio combine to yield the partial half - life , @xmath41 . in 2005",
    "we published a new survey of world data on superallowed @xmath42 beta decays @xcite .",
    "all previously published measurements were included , even those that were based on outdated calibrations if enough information was provided that they could be corrected to modern standards . in all , more than 125 independent measurements of comparable precision , spanning four decades , made the cut . in the two years",
    "since the survey was closed another ten relevant publications have appeared @xcite and we have now incorporated these results into our data base . based on these data for the thirteen most precisely known transitions , we obtain the @xmath27 values shown on the left side of figure  [ fig1 ] ; then , by incorporating the corrections calculated by us in 2002 @xcite and used in our 2005 survey @xcite , we obtain the corrected @xmath6 values plotted on the right side of the figure .",
    "obviously the calculated corrections do a remarkable job eliminating the considerable scatter that is evident in the @xmath27-value plot on the left but is absent in the corrected @xmath6 values shown on the right .",
    "overall , the statistical agreement among the @xmath6 values is quite satisfactory , the normalized @xmath43 being 0.8 .",
    "thus , considering that the correction terms were evaluated completely independently of these data , the consistency among the @xmath6 values can be taken as strong evidence that the correction terms are , in general , soundly based .",
    "however , there is a small but noticeable deviation from the average at @xmath7v ( and possibly @xmath44sc ) , which has only been revealed by the recent penning - trap measurements @xcite of the transition @xmath14 values .",
    "though its statistical significance appears rather marginal in the figure , it must be remarked that the uncertainties quoted on these @xmath6 values have been very conservatively determined . the measured data for each input parameter ",
    "@xmath14-value , half - life and branching ratio  were separately evaluated @xcite and , if the measurements were inconsistent with one another , the weighted - average uncertainty for that parameter was increased to account for that inconsistency . in effect , for such cases , the original uncertainties quoted with the published measurements were all increased by a common  scale factor \" that was large enough to restore statistical consistency among the measurements .",
    "( these scale factors are tabulated for each parameter in ref.@xcite ; they range from 1 to 3.6 . )",
    "this method , which is also used by the particle data group @xcite , leads to final average values that have a high confidence level but it does so at the cost of producing uncertainties that are in many cases larger than would result from a strict statistical average .    with this method of analysis in mind , the excursion of the @xmath7v @xmath6 value can not be entirely ignored as a possible signal that the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections in this mass region are deficient .",
    "it certainly proved to be sufficiently provocative that we were led to the reevaluation of correction terms that is reported here .",
    "for weak vector interactions in hadron states , the cvc hypothesis protects the decay amplitudes from strong - interaction corrections .",
    "however , there is a caveat .",
    "the cvc hypothesis also requires the hadron state to be an exact eigenstate of @xmath45 symmetry ( isospin ) . in nuclei , @xmath45 is always broken , albeit weakly , by coulomb interactions between protons .",
    "there may be other charge - dependent effects as well .",
    "these influences shift the value of the hadron matrix element from its exact symmetry limit to a new value and this shift has to be evaluated before weak - interaction physics can be probed with hadrons . in the case of superallowed @xmath2 decay ,",
    "the hadron matrix element , @xmath31 , is given by eq.([mf2 ] ) and it is @xmath0 that we seek to evaluate .    in the shell model for the cases of interest here , the @xmath46-particle wave functions representing the initial and final states for superallowed @xmath2 decay , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , are states of angular momentum zero and isospin one . in a second quantisation formulation , the fermi matrix element is written m_f = f | _ + | i = _ , f    @xmath2 decay is the isospin ladder operator , @xmath49 creates a neutron in quantum state @xmath21 and @xmath50 annihilates a proton in quantum state @xmath2 .",

    "in fact , the cancellation would be complete if @xmath91 . as we will discuss further in the next section , this cancellation is not in general complete because the radial - mismatch factors for isospin - lesser states are larger than those for isospin - greater states .",

    "furthermore , the more deeply bound the closed - shell orbital , the greater the energy spread in the spectroscopic strength and the more complete the cancellation .",

    "our strategy is to use experiment to guide us in determining which closed - shell orbitals are important enough to include . ideally , of course , one would take the spectroscopic factors determined from experiment and insert them into eq.([dc2_3 ] ) but , especially where delicate cancellations are involved , the reliability of ( forty - year - old ) experimental spectroscopic factors is certainly not up to the task .",
    "our strategy then is to use the shell model to calculate the spectroscopic amplitudes in eq.([dc2_1 ] ) but to limit the sum over orbitals @xmath21 just to those for which large spectroscopic factors have been observed in neutron pick - up reactions .",

    "thus we do not use the experimental spectroscopic factor explicitly , but take them as a guide for which orbitals should be included in the shell - model calculation . in the case of @xmath7v decay , they tell us that orbitals @xmath75 , @xmath77 and @xmath79 should be included . in column five of table",
    "[ t : sfactor ] we give a typical value for the radial mismatch factor , @xmath63 , for the given orbital @xmath21 and isospin @xmath68 .",
    "column seven gives the contribution to @xmath62 from this @xmath21 and isospin @xmath68 if the macfarlane - french sum rule is used for the spectroscopic factor , while in columns eight and nine are shown the results of a detailed shell - model calculation .",
    "the results from the macfarlane - french sum rules and the shell - model calculation are remarkably similar .",
    "the summed @xmath62 for the shell - model calculation ( the sum of all entries in column 9 ) is @xmath96 , nearly a factor of two larger than our previous calculated value , which was published in 2002 @xcite .",
    "the difference between our calculations arises as follows : in 2002 our shell - model calculations for @xmath7v were based on the model space @xmath97 , with six valence nucleons occupying the @xmath15-shell orbitals .",

    "but why stop there ? why not include the @xmath99 and possibly the @xmath100-shell orbitals in the computation ?",
    "our answer is that the neutron pick - up measurement saw little or no evidence for such core states , which implies that their spectroscopic strength is distributed widely over many states . in this case",
    ", the cancellation between isospin - lesser and isospin - greater states becomes more complete and their contribution to @xmath62 is reduced to a level that we believe can be neglected .    with this approach",

    "the evaluation of the former terms yields expressions @xcite that are proportional to @xmath357 , the isospin ladder operator , and so are also proportional to the fermi @xmath2-decay operator .",

    "[ changedns ] in addition to making this change , we have also taken the opportunity to re - evaluate @xmath359 using the more recently available shell - model effective interactions described in sect .  [ sss : smc ] .",

    "we are now in a position to extract corrected @xmath6 values from the current world data for superallowed @xmath1 transitions .",
    "we use the same data set as that described in sect.[s : sbd ] : it represents an interim update of our 2005 complete survey @xcite and includes ten additional published measurements @xcite .",

    "the corrected @xmath6 values are also plotted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is clear from the normalized @xmath43 given on the bottom line of the table that the statistical agreement among the @xmath6 values remains excellent .",
    "furthermore , it is evident from the figure that @xmath7v no longer shows any deviation from the overall average as it did in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "however , it is equally evident that instead the @xmath151mn and @xmath152co @xmath6 values are now low , and by amounts that are no less statistically significant than the amount by which the @xmath7v value was previously high .    rather than being a negative result , however , this possible discrepancy offers us the opportunity to use the cases of @xmath151mn and @xmath152co as a valuable test of our improved calculations . the @xmath14 value for each of them has been measured only twice with ( claimed ) high precision @xcite , and one of these references @xcite also included a measurement of the @xmath14 value for @xmath7v , which penning - trap measurements have recently shown @xcite to be low by 2 kev ",
    "more than three times its originally quoted standard deviation .",
    "if , as seems likely , the problem with the @xmath7v measurement in ref.@xcite is not limited to that measurement alone , then doubt is certainly cast on the @xmath151mn and @xmath152co @xmath14-value results quoted in that reference as well .",
    "new penning - trap measurements of both @xmath14 values are currently in progress @xcite , and the question should be settled shortly .",
    "if the @xmath14 values in ref.@xcite prove to have been too low again , then the new penning - trap measurements will serve to increase the @xmath6 values for @xmath151mn and @xmath152co and could well bring them into close agreement with the average @xmath8 value . if so , this would add strong support to our new calculations .",
    "the average corrected @xmath8 value obtained from our new analysis , 3071.4(8 )  s , is lower by more than one standard deviation , compared to the comparable result obtained in our 2005 survey , 3072.7(8 )  s. if the new measurements do prove to increase the @xmath14 values for @xmath151mn and @xmath152co , then this discrepancy will decrease slightly , but there is no avoiding the fact that the inclusion of some core orbitals in the nuclear - structure - dependent correction terms has increased the correction in a number of cases , which in turn leads to a reduction in their @xmath6 values . a significant change in the nuclear model has led to a significant change  but not a revolutionary one  in the average @xmath8 value .",
    "the new average @xmath8 value yields a new value for @xmath9 via the equation v_ud^2 = , [ vudeq ] where @xmath388 is the well known weak - interaction constant for the purely leptonic muon decay @xcite .",
    "it has been our practice when using the @xmath8 value in this context to add 0.85(85)s to its value to account for possible systematic errors in the treatment of the radial wave function in the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "( this point is discussed in detail in section iii  c of ref.@xcite . ) continuing this practice , we obtain the following result for the up - down element of the ckm matrix : |v_ud| = 0.97418(26 ) . [ vudvalu ] this result can be compared with the value 0.97380(40 ) , which was obtained in 2005 @xcite .",
    "the new value is ( just ) within the uncertainty of the previous value , and carries an uncertainty that is one third smaller .",
    "the final step is to combine this new value of @xmath389 with the other top - row elements of the ckm matrix , @xmath390 and @xmath391 , to test the unitarity of the matrix .",
    "taking the values of the latter two elements from the 2006 particle data group review @xcite we obtain the stunning result    fully satisfied with a precision of 0.1% .",
    "we have presented new calculations of the nuclear - structure - dependent corrections to superallowed @xmath1 nuclear @xmath2 decay .",
    "the calculations incorporate core orbitals in the shell model in cases where independent experimental information indicates that they are required . where possible",
    ", they also make use of effective interactions that have been published since our previous calculation of these correction terms @xcite . as in that work",
    ", we have included twenty transitions in our calculations , thirteen that are by now rather well measured and seven more that are likely to be accessible to precise measurements in the future .",
    "the agreement among the corrected @xmath6 values for the thirteen well measured cases is very good , although there is a possible small discrepancy for the cases of @xmath151mn and @xmath152co .",
    "a new penning - trap measurement of the @xmath14 values for these two transitions is expected in the near future , and its effect on this discrepancy could serve to test the validity of our calculations .    with our new corrections , the value of @xmath389 is increased by 0.04% , or by one standard deviation of the previous result @xcite . with the new value , the sum of squares of the top - row elements of the ckm matrix is in perfect agreement with unitarity .",
    "the improved calculations presented in this work were inspired by the remarkable recent improvements in experimental precision , particularly in the measurement of the @xmath7v @xmath14 value .",
    "the only way that the calculated corrections can be tested and improved is by such precise measurements , both on the currently well - known transitions and on other as - yet - unstudied superallowed transitions that have larger calculated corrections .",
    "if the calculated correction terms replace the significant scatter in the measured @xmath27 values ( see the left panel in fig.[fig1 ] ) with a set of self - consistent corrected @xmath6 values , then they can surely be relied upon to produce a secure value for @xmath389 .",
    "the present calculations testify to the value of increased experimental precision .",
