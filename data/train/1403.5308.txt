    "a number of studies have reported an anti - correlation between fractional linear polarization and total intensity flux density for extragalactic 1.4  ghz sources ; faint sources were found to be more highly polarized . as a result , the euclidean - normalised differential number - counts of polarized sources have been observed to flatten at linearly polarized flux densities @xmath4  @xmath5  1  mjy to levels greater than those expected from convolving the known total intensity source counts with plausible distributions for fractional polarization @xcite .",

    "typical source detection thresholds are 200  @xmath1jy in total intensity and polarization .    in paper",
    "i we presented our data reduction and analysis prescriptions for atlas dr2 .",
    "we presented a catalogue of components ( discrete regions of radio emission ) comprising 2416 detections in total intensity and 172 independent detections in linear polarization .",
    "no components were detected in circular polarization .",
    "we presented a catalogue of 2221 sources ( groups of physically associated radio components ; grouping scheme based on total intensity properties alone , as described below ) , of which 130 were found to exhibit linearly polarized emission .",
    "we described procedures to account for instrumental and observational effects , including spatial variations in each of image sensitivity , bandwidth smearing with a non - circular beam , and instrumental polarization leakage , clean bias , the division between peak and integrated flux densities for unresolved and resolved components , and noise biases in both total intensity and linear polarization .",
    "analytic correction schemes were developed to account for incompleteness in differential component number counts due to resolution and eddington biases .",
    "we cross - identified and classified sources according to two schemes , summarized as follows .    in the first scheme ,",
    "described in   6.1 of paper i , we grouped total intensity radio components into sources , associated these with infrared sources from the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ; * ? ? ? * ) and optical sources from @xcite , then classified them according to whether their energetics were likely to be driven by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , star formation ( sf ) within a star - forming galaxy ( sfg ) , or a radio star . due to the limited angular resolution of the atlas data , in paper i we adopted the term _ lobe _ to describe both jets and lobes in sources with radio double or triple morphologies .",
    "the term _ core _ was similarly defined in a generic manner to indicate the central component in a radio triple source . under this terminology , a core does not indicate a compact , flat - spectrum region of emission ; restarted agn jets or lobes may contribute or even dominate the emission observed in the regions we have designated as cores .",
    "agns were identified using four selection criteria : radio morphologies , 24  @xmath1 m to 1.4  ghz flux density ratios , mid - infrared colours , and optical spectral characteristics .",
    "sfgs and stars were identified solely by their optical spectra . of the 2221 atlas",
    "dr2 sources , 1169 were classified as agns , 126 as sfgs , and 4 as radio stars . we note that our classification system was biased in favour of agns . as a result ,",
    "the atlas dr2 data are in general unsuited for statistical comparisons between star formation and agn activity .    in the second scheme ,",
    "described in   6.2 of paper i , we associated linearly polarized components , or polarization upper limits , with total intensity counterparts . in most cases it was possible to match a single linearly polarized component with a single total intensity component , forming a one - to - one match .",
    "in other cases this was not possible , due to ambiguities posed by the blending of adjacent components ; for example , a polarized component situated mid - way between two closely - separated total intensity components . in these cases , we formed group associations to avoid biasing measurements of fractional polarization .",
    "we classified the polarization ",
    "total intensity associations according to the following scheme , which we designed to account for differing ( de-)polarized morphologies ( see paper  i for graphical examples ) :    * _ type 0 _  a one - to - one or group association identified as a lobe of a double or triple radio source .",
    "both lobes of the source are clearly polarized , having linearly polarized flux densities within a factor of 3 .",
    "( the ratio between lobe total intensity flux densities was found to be within a factor of 3 for all double or triple atlas dr2 sources . ) * _ types 1/2 _  a one - to - one or group association identified as a lobe of a double or triple radio source that does not meet the criteria for type 0 . a lobe classified as type 1 indicates that the ratio of polarized flux densities between lobes is greater than 3 . a lobe classified as type 2 indicates that the opposing lobe is undetected in polarization and that the polarization ratio may be less than 3 , in which case it is possible that more sensitive observations may lead to re - classification as type 0 .",
    "sources with lobes classified as type 1 exhibit asymmetric depolarization in a manner qualitatively consistent with the laing - garrington effect @xcite , where one lobe appears more fractionally polarized than the opposite lobe . *",
    "_ type 3 _  a group association representing a source , involving a linearly polarized component situated midway between two total intensity components .",

    "thus the atlas sources with blue irac colours in fig .",
    "[ ch5:fig : nircc ] are unlikely to be represented by continuum - dominated sources as defined by @xcite .",
    "however , this does not imply that a source observed with blue irac colours at @xmath25 can not be an agn , because sources with mid - infrared spectra dominated by old stellar light may yet exhibit stronger signs of agn activity at other wavelengths .",

    "[ ch5:fig : nircc ] indicates that atlas sources classified as agns are predominantly located in regions 1r and 3 .",

    "the lack of polarized sources in region 2 suggests that the polarized atlas sources observed in region 3 are unlikely to be sfgs with rest - frame colours located in region 2 ( i.e. if sfgs are migrating from region 2 to region 3 with redshift , then a trail of sources would be expected ) .",
    "instead , we find two concentrations of polarized atlas sources , highly coincident with the regions of parameter space identified by @xcite in which starlight- and continuum - dominated sources were preferentially located .",
    "thus we find that the radio emission from polarized atlas sources is most likely powered by agns , where the active nuclei are embedded within host galaxies with mid - infrared spectra dominated by old - population stellar light ( blue irac colours ) or continuum likely produced by dusty tori ( red irac colours ) .",
    "this finding is in general agreement with the results from the elais - north 1 ( elais - n1 ) region presented by both @xcite and @xcite , but with the following two notable exceptions .",

    "11 from @xcite indicates that these sources are located within a region of parameter space occupied by individual stars .",
    "it is not clear why the irac colours of so many of the radio sources presented by @xcite and @xcite were found to occupy this region of parameter space , though it is possible that their selection of isophotal flux densities for unresolved infrared sources may have biased their colour ratios ( aperture values are more appropriate for point sources ) . and second , unlike these previous works , we do not find any polarized atlas sources in which the radio emission is likely to be powered by star formation ( i.e. we do not see any polarized sources in region 2 ; cf . * ? ? ?",

    "[ ch5:fig : fracpolclass ] , we note that a general observational consequence of the rising distribution of fractional polarization upper limits with decreasing total intensity flux density is that the mean or median fractional polarization of _ detected _ polarized sources will always _ appear _ to increase with decreasing flux density .",

    "any changes to the underlying distribution of fractional polarization with decreasing total intensity flux density will be masked , and thus dominated , by this selection bias .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to investigate the distribution of fractional polarization at faint flux densities without accounting for polarization non - detections .",
    "recently , 1.4  ghz polarimetric studies of the elais - n1 field @xcite and atlbs fields @xcite concluded that their observational data demonstrated an anti - correlation between fractional polarization and total intensity flux density .",

    "@xcite accounted for selection bias using monte carlo analysis , effectively incorporating polarization upper limits .",
    "@xcite accounted for selection bias by comparing samples of sources in bins of polarized flux density rather than total flux density , at sufficient polarized flux densities to neglect upper limits .",
    "however , the findings of increased fractional polarization at faint total flux densities by @xcite and @xcite appear to be reliant on the increasing number of sources observed with @xmath33 at these faint levels .",
    "for example , both studies reported extreme sources with @xmath40 , but only at faint total intensities .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found that @xmath41 of polarized sources with linearly polarized flux densities @xmath42  mjy ( i.e. a significant proportion of these sources ) exhibited @xmath33 , while no sources with such high levels of fractional polarization were found for @xmath43  mjy .",
    "as described earlier , the @xmath33 sources ( and perhaps many with lower @xmath37 ) are likely to reflect rms noise estimation and source extraction errors .",
    "the analytic form assumed by @xcite for the distribution of fractional polarization ( which will be described in   [ ch5:secressubpi ] ) may have also contributed to their conclusion regarding increased fractional polarization ; spurious conclusions may be obtained if the observed fractional polarization data do not follow the assumed analytic form of the fit .",
    "the arguments above suggest that existing evidence for an anti - correlation between fractional polarization and total flux density may not be robust .",
    "similar to the studies above , earlier works by and @xcite concluded that nvss @xcite sources exhibited an anti - correlation between fractional linear polarization and total intensity flux density .",
    "these analyses in effect incorporated polarization upper bounds ( though not upper _ limits _ ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because @xcite recorded a linearly polarized flux density for each nvss source , regardless of the statistical significance of the polarization measurement . to determine the significance of their findings and thus form a conclusion regarding evidence for anti - correlation , which we use to justify our own fractional polarization model presented in",
    "  [ ch5:secressubpi ] , we need to examine their works in more detail .    and @xcite presented fractional polarization distributions for steep- and flat / inverted - spectrum nvss sources in four flux density intervals : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47  mjy .",
    "their distributions are remarkably consistent for @xmath48 , exhibiting a log - normal form with approximately equal dispersion and a peak at @xmath49 .",
    "a separate component with a peak at @xmath50 is also present in each distribution , representing sources with polarization dominated by instrumental leakage .",
    "we observe that the dispersions of their distributions broaden with increasing flux density , solely due to broadening at @xmath36 .",
    "found that the median fractional polarization was larger for the @xmath44  mjy data than for the @xmath47  mjy data , for both steep- and flat - spectrum sources .",
    "@xcite found the same result but for steep - spectrum sources only .",
    "these results were essentially based on the lack of sources with @xmath51 in the @xmath44  mjy data when compared with the increased presence of such sources at higher flux densities ; a proportional increase in the number of sources with @xmath48 for decreasing flux density was not observed .",
    "however , the presence of sources with @xmath51 ( i.e. less than the typical leakage level of @xmath50 ) , and more generally the slight changes in distribution shape observed for @xmath36 between different flux density intervals , may be more appropriately explained by the influence of noise on polarized flux densities rather than by variation in the underlying distribution of fractional polarization . to demonstrate",
    ", we first note that the expectation value of @xmath4 for an unpolarized nvss source is given by the mean of a rayleigh distribution ( i.e. a ricean distribution with no underlying polarized signal ) , which is @xmath52  mjy for @xmath53  mjy .",
    "this value is also characteristic of the expected observed polarized flux density for a source with true underlying polarized signal @xmath54  @xmath5  @xmath55 ( e.g. see the upper panel of fig .  1 from @xcite ) .",
    "thus , a tail of sources with true polarization @xmath54  @xmath5  0.29  mjy will appear in the fractional polarization distribution at @xmath37  @xmath21  0.18% for total intensity sources with @xmath56  mjy , and at @xmath37  @xmath5  0.05% for @xmath57  mjy .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the distributions presented by and @xcite ; a tail of sources with @xmath51 was observed for the @xmath47  mjy data but not for the @xmath44  mjy data .",
    "we therefore conclude that the results presented by and @xcite do not demonstrate a statistically significant anti - correlation between fractional linear polarization and total intensity flux density .",
    "furthermore , we note that the fractional polarization distributions presented in these works are likely to overestimate the population of sources with @xmath36 , even for the @xmath44  mjy data , for the following two reasons .",
    "first , all catalogued nvss measurements of polarized flux density were debiased using a modified version of the expectation value for a ricean distribution @xcite .",
    "this debiasing scheme is known to impart a significant overcorrection ( i.e. negative bias ) at low snr ( e.g. see ; the relevant scheme is labelled in reference to its application by @xcite ) .",
    "thus measurements of fractional polarization obtained using the nvss catalogue are likely to be negatively biased . and",
    "second , raw polarization measurements for nvss sources were obtained by interpolation at the total intensity centre position .",
    "therefore , polarized flux densities were underestimated for each source in which the spatial peak of polarized emission was located in an adjacent pixel to the total intensity peak .",
    "both of these effects could have been largely mitigated by obtaining polarization upper limits for sources , rather than upper bounds .",
    "returning to the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ ch5:fig : fracpolclass ] , we find that the maximum level of fractional polarization exhibited by atlas sources does not appear to be correlated with total intensity flux density .",
    "the maximum level appears to be limited to @xmath37  @xmath5  20% for @xmath14  @xmath21  1  mjy , which becomes a strict limit for @xmath58  mjy when accounting for the presence of all upper limits .",
    "furthermore , we find @xmath37  @xmath21  0.4% for sources with @xmath14  @xmath21  10  mjy , where sources exhibiting higher levels of fractional polarization significantly outnumber those potentially exhibiting @xmath59 as indicated by the upper limits .",
