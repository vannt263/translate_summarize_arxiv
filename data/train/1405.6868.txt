    "the circular feature bordering the low - emission center region ( most prominent for @xmath8390@xmath84 , @xmath85180@xmath84 , third row ) is caused by the emission of the forward arm toward the b star touching the edge of the computational domain .",
    "if seen from the opposite direction ( second row ) , it is highly suppressed because of an unfavourable scattering angle .",

    "we showed that low stellar separations ( 720 r@xmath87 for the studied wr - b system , case a ) inhibits the acceleration of high - energy electrons at the apex of the wcr due to strong ic and synchrotron losses .",

    "accordingly , the total flux for e@xmath861 kev decreases for all three flux components if we increase stellar separation by a factor of four .",
    "the strong dependence on stellar separation suggests that @xmath0-ray binaries are liable to show a significant variation in their spectra in course of an elliptical orbit with high eccentricity .",
    "spectra can exhibit multiple emission components ( as in figure [ gamspec1 ] a ) ) for low separations ( i.e. during periastron ) , contrasted by longer periods of one - component spectra ( as in figure [ gamspec1 ] c ) ) for larger stellar separations .",

    "the application of our numerical model to other specific candidates for particle - acceleration cwb systems ( see catalogue of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will provide predictions for the nonthermal high - energy flux that can then be related to detections and upper limits from observations .",
    "varying the orientation of the binary system by changing the viewing angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we find a strong dependence of the ic flux component .",
    "photons from bremsstrahlung and neutral pion decay are influenced only indirectly via the changing conditions for photon photon opacity which affect all components at high energies alike .",
    "this effect remains small compared to the variation of the ic component due to its dependence on the scattering angle .",
    "since we consider the radiation field of both stars , the ic component does not vanish as the flux from one population of target photons is maximal when the other is minimal .",
    "however , since the two radiation fields differ in intensity depending on distance and identity of the star , there remains a significant level of variation .",
    "it is largest for the case of small stellar separation where the b star is very close to the wcr . here",
    ", the ic - flux above 100 mev varies a factor of 8 between the two extreme cases of ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) and ( @xmath90 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "although this dependence is small for the cases we investigated , it becomes significantly stronger if we have a binary system with greater differences concerning the two stellar radiation fields and the ram pressure of the winds .",
    "the ic contribution to the @xmath0-ray flux will differ by several orders of magnitude in course of an orbital cycle if the thermal photon density of one stellar component is dominant and the orbital inclination is close to the edge - on case of @xmath93 .",

    "given their low prominence in case of low stellar separation , there is no noticeable impact .",
    "however , for larger stellar separation , the absorption leaves a clear signature in the spectral components of ic scattering and bremsstrahlung .    studying the impact of orbital motion for the case of smaller stellar separation",
    ", we find a number of effects that are all significantly less severe than the ones obtained for varying the stellar separation by a factor of two .",
    "the distortion of the wcr leads to regions of altered wind velocity normal to the shock and , thus , to notable changes in the dsa acceleration rate . whereas ic emission is greatly reduced in the trailing arm toward the b star ( and also in the forward arm toward the wr star ) , we find regions of higher maximum energies for electrons ( than in the case without orbital motion ) in the side of the forward arm toward the b star . in terms of seds , this leads to an additional bump in the ic component .",
    "the changes due to orbital motion are less pronounced for the bremsstrahlung and neutral pion decay components .",
    "the presented numerical model can be used to study the high - energy nonthermal flux of specific particle - accelerating cwb systems as a function of time .",
    "possible variations in course of the orbit can be quantitatively assessed and favourable observation periods can be predicted .",
    "compared to observational @xmath0-ray data ( e.g. from the fermi - lat instrument ) , our simulation aims for constraining and refinement of poorly known parameters , such as as the injection fraction of electrons and protons at the shock of the wind collision region .",
    "dependencies on other parameters , such as the magnetic field and the diffusion coefficient , can be studied as well",
    ".    the consequent next step will be the application of our simulation procedure to archetypal nonthermal binary systems .",
    "we will confront hardly understood discrepancies between existing flux predictions from analytical models with the present absence of detections of particular enigmatic systems in the _",
