    "the concepts of effective field theory ( eft ) have provided a modern perspective to the relativistic mean - field models @xcite . the eft based relativistic mean - field ( ermf ) models are obtained by expanding the energy density functional in powers of the fields for scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath1 ) , vector - isoscalar ( @xmath0 ) and vector - isovector ( @xmath2 ) mesons and their derivatives upto a given order @xmath6 .",
    "thus , a ermf model includes the contributions from all possible self and mixed interaction terms for @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons in addition to the cubic and quartic self interaction terms for @xmath1 meson as present in the conventional quantum hydrodynamic based relativistic mean field models @xcite .",
    "the parameters ( or the expansion coefficients ) appearing in the energy density functional are so adjusted that the ermf results for a set of nuclear observables agree well with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the eft demands that the adjusted parameters must exhibit  naturalness \" , i.e. , the values of all the parameters should be roughly of same size when expressed in appropriate dimensionless ratios @xcite .",
    "the lack of  naturalness \" implies that the omitted terms are important .",
    "sometimes not all the terms upto a given order @xmath6 are considered which might lead to unnaturalness @xcite . it is found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ermf models containing terms upto order @xmath7 can be satisfactorily applied to study the properties of finite nuclei .",
    "the inclusion of next higher order terms improves the fit to the finite nuclear properties only marginally . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that even high density behaviour of the equation of state ( eos ) of pure neutron matter and @xmath3-stable matter are predominantly controlled by the quartic order @xmath0 meson self - coupling ( omsc ) .",
    "the effects of inclusion of higher order terms on the high density behaviour of eos are found to be only modest to negligible .",
    "there have been several parameterizations @xcite of ermf models containing most of the terms upto the quartic order ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "these parameter sets are obtained by a fit to the set of experimental data for the properties of a few stable closed shell nuclei . the fitted parameters exhibit  naturalness \" .",
    "but , some of the nuclear matter properties they yield requires attention ; the linear density dependence of the symmetry energy coefficient is strong and the nuclear matter incompressibility coefficient @xmath9 is either little too low or quite high .",
    "the linear density dependence of the symmetry energy coefficient and the nuclear matter incompressibility coefficient should be adjusted to yield reasonably the neutron - skin thickness and the centroid energy of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance , respectively .",
    "the fsugold parameter set is obtained recently @xcite in such a way that they give realistic values for all the properties normally associated with the nuclear matter at the saturation density . however , some of the parameters of fsugold set show deviation from  naturalness \" .",
    "this may be pointing to the fact that the contributions due to the mixed interaction terms involving @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons omitted from the fsugold parametrization are important .",
    "for fsugold parameters , the limiting mass of the neutron star is only 1.7@xmath12 which might reduce further with the inclusion of hyperons degree of freedom @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an early study using ermf model shows ref.@xcite that by changing the value of omsc within a reasonable range , the limiting mass of neutron stars can be varied from 1.8@xmath12 - 2.8@xmath13 for a fixed set of nuclear matter properties . of course , for a realistic variation in the value of limiting mass , the nuclear matter properties must be determined from the experimental data on the finite nuclei .",
    "it is also to be noted that in ref.@xcite the effects of the mixed interactions were not considered and no constrain was imposed on the density dependence of symmetry energy coefficient .    in the present work",
    "we have performed a realistic investigation involving the effects of omsc on the properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars using a ermf model .",
    "we consider a ermf model which includes the contributions from all possible mixed interactions between the @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons upto the quartic order .",
    "like , in the case of fsugold parametrization , we determine all the properties normally associated with nuclear matter from the experimental data on the finite nuclei .",
    "we generate several parameter sets for fixed values of omsc by adjusting the remaining parameters of the ermf model to fit exactly the same set of experimental data for the total binding energies and charge rms radii for some closed shell nuclei .",
    "the binding energy data is considered for nuclei ranging from normal to the exotic ones .",
    "we also include in our fit the value of the neutron - skin thickness for @xmath14pb nucleus to constrain the linear density dependence of the symmetry energy coefficient .",
    "we restrict the value of the nuclear matter incompressibility coefficient to be within @xmath15 mev as required by the experimental data on the centroid energies for the isoscalar giant monopole resonance .",
