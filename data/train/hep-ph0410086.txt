    "the discovery of the strange baryon @xmath0 at 1540 mev @xcite - @xcite opened a new chapter in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "if confirmed by high statistics experiments , it will challenge the commonly used naive quark model that worked so well for almost four decades .",
    "two questions will have to be answered : 1 ) what is the new dynamical mechanism overlooked so far that renders light and narrow exotic pentaquarks and 2 ) why the nonexotic states are not affected by this mechanism , in other words : why the naive quark model works so well in the nonexotic sector .",
    "of course a likely answer might be that the key ingredient missing in the naive quark model is chiral symmetry and that baryons are solitons in an effective chiral model @xcite - @xcite .",
    "after all , exotic antidecuplet emerges naturally in chiral soliton models @xcite - @xcite .",
    "indeed , light and narrow @xmath0 was predicted many years before its discovery @xcite in the chiral quark - soliton model @xcite - @xcite .",
    "even then some aspects of the soliton models have to be clarified and better understood @xcite - @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to examine if the su(3 ) symmetry alone is able to explain , or ",
    "more modestly  to accommodate further exotics that follow inevitably from the discovery of @xmath0 .",
    "experimentally another exotic state , namely @xmath4 ( here subscript @xmath5 refers to isospin ) , has been already announced by na49 experiment at cern @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it is clear that there must be other cryptoexotic states which span antidecuplet of flavor su(3 ) .",
    "these states are cryptoexotic since unlike @xmath0 and @xmath1 their quantum numbers can be constructed from 3 quarks only , however symmetry requires that in fact they contain an additional @xmath6 pair .",
    "these cryptoexotic states , and more precisely the cryptoexotic nucleon - like states , are the primary subject of the present note . in section [ sect2 ]",
    "we calculate mass spectrum in the moderately broken su(3 ) symmetry and then postulate ideal mixing .",
    "model - independent sum rules for the masses of exotic baryons are derived .",
    "we also show that the ideal mixing ( _ i.e. _ requirement that physical states are defined as the ones which posses definite number of ( anti)strange quarks ) is  under assumption of small symmetry breaking  unable to accommodate known nucleon resonances such as roper and @xmath2 . in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] we further show that also the decay widths are incompatible with ideal mixing .    in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] we slightly change the subject . in the large @xmath3 limit , flavor su(3 )",
    "representations are no longer ordinary octet and decuplet . in soliton models their generalizations",
    "are straightforwardly constructed @xcite because of the constraint coming from the wess - zumino term @xcite - @xcite : @xmath7 and @xmath8 . where number of quark indices is @xmath9 and antiquark indices @xmath10 , or by dimension with `` bar '' if @xmath11 .",
    "] moreover @xmath12 .",
    "we show that in the quark model with diquark correlations , the construction in which diquarks contain 2 quarks for arbitrary @xmath3 reproduces the same sequence of su(3 ) representations . as a result",
    "the ideal mixing can be generalized to arbitrary ( odd ) @xmath3 .",
    "we summarize in sect .",
    "[ sect5 ]    most of this work was done during my short visits at the institut fr theoretische physik ii of the ruhr - university in bochum in january and june 2003 .",
    "it is always a pleasure to visit this lively international group led by klaus goeke whose support and enthusiasm stay beyond the predictions which led to the discovery of pentaquarks .",
    "it is a great honor to dedicate to klaus this set of remarks on the su(3 ) nature of exotic states .",
    "quantum numbers of @xmath13 require that its minimal quark content is @xmath14 .",
    "two quarks can be either in flavor @xmath15 or @xmath16",
    ". therefore possible representations for 4 quarks are contained in the direct products@xmath17here @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "adding an @xmath15 antiquark yields@xmath20therefore @xmath21 state can be in one of the following flavor representations :    @xmath22    whether all representations ( [ reps ] ) are allowed depends on the dynamics of a specific model .",
    "[ fig : mixing ]    out of allowed representations ( [ reps ] ) the lowest one including explicitly exotic states is @xmath23 which appears in a direct product of 4 quarks in flavor @xmath24 and an antiquark : @xmath25 and is therefore inevitably accompanied by an octet ( see fig .",
    "fig : mixing ) .",
    "since both representations may have spin @xmath26 it is reasonable to assume that in the first approximation the masses of @xmath27 and @xmath23 are degenerate . unlike in the case of the ordinary octet and decuplet , pentaquark symmetry states ( _ i.e. _ states which are pure octet or antidecuplet )",
    "do not have a unique quark structure .",
    "for example a proton - like state in antidecuplet and octet have the following quark content:@xmath28 where it is implicitly assumed that four quarks are in a pure @xmath24 state .",
    "similarly @xmath29-like states mix , while @xmath30 and @xmath31-like states remain unmixed .",
    "the qcd splitting hamiltonian @xmath32 that transforms like @xmath33 @xmath34 component of the octet tensor operator , has the following matrix elements between the pentaquark states:@xmath35@xmath36 and@xmath37 for nucleon - like and @xmath29-like states .",
    "constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 are unknown reduced matrix elements . equations ( [ diagonal ] ) would be the ordinary gell - mann  okubo mass formulae if not for the mixing term ( 8a10mix ) which is non - zero because pentaquark octet and antidecuplet have the same spin .",
    "now let us assume that strong interactions diagonalize ( anti)strange quark content .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the mass matrix take the following form for the nucleon - like states ( @xmath40:@xmath41 and for @xmath33 @xmath42 @xmath29-like states:@xmath43 and similarly for @xmath44 .",
    "the requirement that mass matrix is diagonal in the ( anti)strange quark basis leads to the relations : @xmath45 so that the whole spectrum depends on two constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the overall mass scale @xmath48:@xmath49 here by @xmath50 and @xmath51 we denote octet - like states with additional @xmath52 or @xmath53 pair and subscript @xmath54 denotes additional @xmath55 pair .",
    "@xmath31 stands for both @xmath56 and @xmath57 states .",
    "the requirement that the mass matrix is diagonal in the ( anti)strange quark basis reduced the number of the unknown constants describing the splittings from 4 to 2 .",
    "scenario that the strong interactions diagonalize ( anti)strange content is known as _ ideal mixing_.",
    "it has been discussed in more detail in the context of the diquark model proposed by nussinov @xcite and jaffe and wilczek @xcite where pentaquarks are viewed as bound states of two diquarks and an antiquark .",
    "diqaurks are color and flavor antitriplets in a relative @xmath58-wave , hence two diquark state is a color @xmath59 and flavor @xmath24 .",
    "the motivation for a diqaurk picture comes from the attraction between two quarks in a @xmath15 color channel .",
    "diquark correlations have been discussed in the context of meson spectroscopy jaffe:1977ig .",
    "a schematic hamiltonian for a diquark - like pentaquarks has been proposed in ref .",
    "it contains two parameters : strange quark mass @xmath60 and parameter @xmath61 which is embodies the fact that diquarks involving strange quark are more tightly bound .",
    "these parameters are related to the reduced matrix elements introduced in ( diagonal ) in the following way@xmath62 a somewhat different hamiltonian was introduced by cohen in ref .",
    "it is expressed in terms of a total number of strange quarks and the excess of strange over antistrange quarks .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath63 also falls in the above category with @xmath64 and @xmath65 in ( [ fdinjw ] ) .",
    "a quantitative support for the dipole picture comes also from the instanton liquid model of the qcd vacuum .",
    "there , a tightly bound scalar diquark is found to have a mass of a single constituent quark , however , a tensor diquark in flavor @xmath16 is only slightly heavier ( 570 mev ) shuryak:2003zi . if so , a bound state of scalar and tensor diquarks and a light antiquark would fall into @xmath66 of flavor su(3 ) and , since there would be no penalty for the @xmath58-wave excitation , this state should be lighter than a bound state of two scalar diquarks in a @xmath58-wave and an antiquark .",
    "one should , however , consider this possibility with care , since once the diquarks overlap they may dissolve .",
    "any model hamiltonian of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking with ideal mixing must obey equations ( [ split ] ) .",
    "these equations lead to the model independent relations@xmath67 ( and linear combinations of ( [ relations ] ) ) .",
    "now we shall try to constrain further the remaining two free parameters @xmath47 and @xmath46 . to this end",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : dspectrum ] the splittings ( in units of @xmath46 ) as functions of parameter @xmath68 .",
    "we see that for @xmath69 ( depicted by thin vertical lines ) the states are ordered according to the increasing number of ( anti)strange quarks . for @xmath70 the levels",
    "are equally spaced and the states with the same number of ( anti)strange quarks are degenerate .",
    "it is therefore a reasonable starting point for a small perturbation in @xmath71 which would lift this degeneracy introducing small splittings in a way similar to the @xmath72 splitting in the regular octet .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : dspectrum ] and eqs.([split ] ) that to the left of @xmath73 the following splittings become equal : @xmath74 for @xmath75 , whereas to the right of @xmath73 : @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "if the splittings of the states with identical ( anti)strange content are to be smaller than those which differ by one ( anti)strange quark , then one should require @xmath78 .",
    "we shall shortly see that only @xmath79 leads to the reasonable phenomenology .",
    "[ fig : dspectrum ]    now let us use experimental input for the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath80",
    ". with this input the whole spectrum ( [ split ] ) depends only on one free parameter which we choose to be @xmath68 . in table ( [ tab : xmass ] ) we display the masses of the remaining cryptoexotic states and the values of parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 for three choices of @xmath71 : 3/4 , 1 and 3/2 .",
    "we see that for @xmath81 the lightest state , namely the @xmath50 resonance , is unrealistically light . on the other hand for @xmath77 the two nucleon - like resonances @xmath50 and @xmath82 have masses which allow to identify them with the roper and @xmath2 .",

    ": @xmath96the amplitude for the decay width would be the sum over @xmath97 and 8 . however , since the decay width of @xmath98 is very small , indicating that @xmath99 ( remember @xmath0 does not mix ) , the @xmath23 component in eqs.([roper1710 ] ) can be safely neglected in the first approximation . then @xmath100where we have used physical masses for roper and @xmath101 .",
    "equation ( [ gamrat ] ) indicates that partial decay widths of the nucleon - like pentaquark resonances have to be of the same order : either both small or both large .",
    "this observation was first made by cohen @xcite and presented in form of the inequality connecting different decay constants .",
    "experimentally @xcite @xmath102 mev and @xmath103 mev . order of magnitude difference between the partial decay widths of roper and @xmath101 remains in contradiction with the ideal mixing scenario .",
    "of course ideal is mixing probably an idealization .",
    "the nonideal mixing would invalidate cohen s inequality .",
    "more general scenarios have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite - @xcite . however , the discussion of masses and decay widths of the @xmath104 states under assumption that they correspond to the roper and @xmath95 done in ref .",
    "pakvasa:2004pg still indicates that it is impossible to match the mass splittings with the observed branching ratios for these two resonances even for arbitrary mixing .",
    "it is shown that the _ nonideal _  mixing required for the decay @xmath105 is not compatible with the mixing deduced from the masses .",
    "the conclusion of ref .",
    "pakvasa:2004pg is that most probably @xmath106 is not a member of @xmath23 but rather of @xmath107 .",
    "that would release constraints on the @xmath108 state coming from the equal spacing of antidecuplet .",
    "another possibility based on the nonideal mixing scenario advocated by diakonov and petrov @xcite is that there should be a new @xmath104 resonance in the mass range of @xmath109 mev , a possibility discarded in ref .",

    "[ fig : largereps ] .",
    "although it possible to show on general grounds that representation content of the quark model and soliton model coincide for large @xmath3 @xcite , it is instructive to illustrate this in the specific quark model .",

    "two quarks antisymmetrized in color and flavor still form flavor @xmath15 but color representation is ( anti ) @xmath116 . here",

    "only @xmath1 in @xmath125 will additionally mix with spurious sates in @xmath126 , however , the latter states will disappear for @xmath124 .",
    "finally let us remark , that another generalization of the diquark picture which parallels junction models would result in a completely different representation structure .",
    "indeed , another possible generalization of a diquark would be to antisymmetrize @xmath127 quarks .",
    "we would have then to take @xmath127 of such `` diquarks '' and add an antiquark . in this case",
    "`` pentaquarks '' would consist of @xmath128 quarks and an antiquark .",
    "this would be a completely different object than the regular pentaquark constructed from @xmath129 quarks and an antiquark , although accidentally for @xmath124 both pictures coincide .",

    "similar conclusion has been reached in ref .",
    "@xcite where mixing scenario was discussed within the framework of the quark soliton model . here",
    "already the ordinary nucleon state has a non - negligible admixture of @xmath23 .",
    "taking this mixing into account the authors of ref .",
    "arndt:2003ga estimated the width of a possible but yet undiscovered @xmath104 state of a mass of @xmath130 @xmath131 mev to be @xmath132 @xmath133 mev .",
    "although quite narrow , this width is too large to be accommodated in the @xmath134 scattering data .",
    "the same authors @xcite claim that the improved phase shift analysis admits two candidates for the narrow resonances of these masses but with decays widths smaller than @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) mev . further decrease of theoretical predictions might be achieved by adding a mixing to yet another nucleon - like state as roper and @xmath95 . and even further suppression of this decay is provided by the @xmath107 admixture as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .      to conclude let us note that physics of @xmath104 and @xmath137 states will be most probably physics of extensive mixing between different nearby states .",
    "it is clear from our discussion above that the consistent physical picture requires the existence of yet undiscovered nucleon resonances within the mass range of @xmath138 mev or so .",
