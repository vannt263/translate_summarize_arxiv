    "the baade - wesselink ( b - w ) analysis of rr lyrae stars can help solve this problem . for a review and general description of this method and its assumptions and approximations",
    "see for example gautschy ( 1987 ) .",
    "previous b - w analyses were performed on 29 field rr lyraes by a few independent groups , e.g. liu & janes ( 1990 ) , jones et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , cacciari , clementini & fernley ( 1992 ) , and skillen et al .",
    "these references are only indicative and are by no means exhaustive or complete .",
    "the results of these and several more b - w studies have been reanalysed and summarised by fernley ( 1994 ) and fernley et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who find a relation @xmath3 + 0.98 \\pm 0.05 $ ] between the absolute visual magnitude and the metallicity of the rr lyrae stars .",
    "this result is intermediate but closer to the short distance scale , corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "the previous b - w analyses were based on : i ) kurucz ( 1979 ) model atmospheres , with turbulent velocity @xmath5 = 2 km / s ; ii ) semi - empirical temperature calibration ; iii ) mostly ir ( i.e. k ) , but also visual v , r and i photometry ; iv ) the use of an average value for gravity ( usually log@xmath6=2.75 ) ; v ) a restricted phase range for fitting ( usually 0.35 to 0.80 ) ; vi ) the barycentric ( also called @xmath7- ) velocity derived as simple integration over the entire pulsation cycle ; vii ) a constant factor ( 1.38 ) to transform radial into pulsational velocities .",
    "several model atmospheres are now available , with : improved _ opacities _ ; different treatments of _ convection _ ; different values of _ turbulent velocity _ ; more accurate _ temperature and bc calibrations_. the aim of the present work is to test what is the effect of these new models and calibrations , as well as of other assumptions , on the b - w results for rr lyrae stars .",
    "@xmath8 * model atmospheres . *",
    "we have used the following sets of model atmospheres : + i ) kurucz ( 1995 ) with mlt+overshooting treatment of convection , @xmath5 = 2 and 4 km / s , [ m / h]=0.0 ; ii ) castelli ( 1999b ) with mlt without overshooting treatment of convection , [ m / h]=0.0 and @xmath5 = 2 km / s , and [ m / h]=1.5 and @xmath5 = 2 and 4 km / s .",
    "the models at [ m / h]=1.5 are enhanced in @xmath9-elements by [ @xmath9/@xmath10=+0.4 .",
    "iii ) castelli ( 1999a ) experimental models with no convection . these models do not have physical meaning , but are only intended to mimick the effects of recent treatments of convection , e.g. mlt with l / h=0.5 instead of 1.25 ( fuhrmann , axer , & gehren 1993 ) , or canuto & mazzitelli ( 1992 ) approximation that predicts a very low convection or zero convection for stars with @xmath11 7000 k and that has been suggested to provide a better match to the data ( see gardiner , kupka , & smalley 1999 for a recent re - discussion of this issue ) .",
    "the no - convection models are available for [ m / h]=0.0 and 1.5 and @xmath5 = 2 km / s .",
    "@xmath8 * gravities . * the values of log@xmath6",
    "have been calculated at each phase - step from radius percentage variation ( assuming @xmath12r/@xmath13 15% ) plus the acceleration component derived from the radial velocity curve .",
    "the zero - point was set from theoretical zahb models , i.e. log@xmath6=2.86 at the phase corresponding to average radius .",
    "note that all zahb models give average log@xmath6=2.86 @xmath14 0.01 ( dorman , rood , & oconnell 1993 ; sweigart 1997 with no he - mixing ; chieffi , limongi & straniero 1998 ) with the only exception of sweigart ( 1997 ) models with he - mix=0.10 which give log@xmath6=2.75 but may not be applicable to our field stars .",
    "@xmath8 * semi - empirical teff and bc calibration . *",
    "we have used montegriffo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) semi - empirical @xmath15 and @xmath16 calibration and temperature scale for popii giants , that is based on rgb and hb stars in 10 globular clusters .    @xmath8",
    "* gamma - velocity .",
    "* the default value of the @xmath7-velocity was estimated from integration of the observed radial velocity curve over the entire pulsation cycle , as it was done in all previous b - w studies . however ,",
    "oke , giver , & searle ( 1962 ) had suggested for su dra that velocity gradients may exist in the atmosphere , and proposed to take them into account by correcting the observed radial velocities of a positive quantity that would vary about linearly between phase 0.95 and 0.40 . on the other hand ,",
    "jones et al .",
    "( 1987 ) found no observational evidence of velocity gradients among weak metal lines in x ari , at least within their observational errors ( @xmath14 2 km / s ) .",
    "chadid & gillet ( 1998 ) , however , did seem to find some evidence of differential velocities among weak metal lines in rr lyr : the radial velocity curve from the feii(@xmath174923.9 ) line shows a slightly larger amplitude than that from the fei(@xmath174920.5 ) line which forms a little deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "a similar effect was found between baii and tiii lines , and is related to the presence of strong shocks .",
    "+ therefore , in addition to the default @xmath7-velocity calculation from the observed rv curve , we have simulated two other cases , @xmath7 - 1 where the rv curve has been corrected as suggested by oke et al . ( 1962 ) albeit by a much smaller amount ( + 2.0 km / s at most ) , and @xmath7 - 2 where the amplitude of the rv curve has been stretched by @xmath14 5 km / s at the phases of maximum and minimum rv .",
    "these simulations are only numerical experiments and do not intend to provide realistic answers to the problem of radial velocity gradients in the atmosphere : the radial velocities for the rr lyrae stars are derived from a large number of weak metal lines and it is still totally unclear which correction ( if any ) should be applied to the average values in the presence of velocity gradients among some of these lines .      @xmath8 * the @xmath18-factor .",
    "* the factor used to transform radial into pulsational velocity has been assumed to be 1.38 , as in fernley ( 1994 ) .",
    "it might be a few % smaller , this conservative assumption gives the brightest possible luminosity as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath8 * fitting phase interval .",
    "* as with all previous applications of the b - w method , the fitting has not been performed on the entire pulsation cycle , but on a restricted phase interval appropriate for each star : 0.30 - 0.80 for sw and , for best stability of results ; and 0.25 - 0.70 for rr cet , to avoid shock - perturbed phases .",
    "we have used all possible and compatible data from the literature , i.e. bvrik and uvby photometry , and radial velocities . the adopted input parameters for this star are [ fe / h]=0.0 , e(b ",
    "v)=0.09 , @xmath7-velocity=19.94 km / s and @xmath19=9.44 .",
    "the default model calibration on vega led to systematically hotter temperatures ( by @xmath20 180k ) from the ( b  v ) colors with respect to all other colors .",
    "this difference has no physical justification , and is only due to a behaviour of the models that was already known and commented by castelli ( 1999b ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this hotter temperature by @xmath20 180k leads to a brighter @xmath21 magnitude by @xmath200.12 mag using the combination v and b@xmath22v in the b - w analysis , and by only @xmath200.02 mag using k and b@xmath22v . _",
    "it is important to note that the use of the k magnitude with any color , in particular v@xmath22k , is the least affected by temperature uncertainties , and provides the most stable results . _    in table 1 we summarize the values of @xmath23 that result from the use of the k magnitude and the various colors and models .",
    "the models are labelled as : k2 and k4 for kurucz ( 1995 ) with @xmath5= 2 and 4 km / s respectively ; k2-nover and k2-noconv for castelli ( 1999a , b ) @xmath5= 2 km / s and the no - overshooting and no - convection approximations respectively ; montegriffo for the montegriffo et al .",

    "@xmath8 correcting the rv curve by stretching the amplitude in analogy to the behaviour of feii and baii lines ( case @xmath7 - 2 ) leads to brighter magnitudes .",
    "the amount of brightening we have estimated is however too large , since the correction we have applied ( @xmath14 5 km / s ) was exaggerated for the sake of computation .",
    "@xmath8 the meaning of our simulations with the no - convection models is only to point out that , if the effect of convection were indeed overestimated by the present mlt , a more correct treatment with a reduced impact of convection would lead to brighter magnitudes for solar - metallicity stars , but would have lesser consequences on metal - poor stars .",
    "gardiner et al . ( 1999 ) reach no definitive conclusion on this subject , and suggest that the classical treatment of convection with l / h=1.25 may still be the best approach in the temperature range 6000 - 7000k which is relevant for rr lyrae stars around minimum light .",
    "@xmath8 the corrections to the radial velocity curves simulated with rr cet are quite arbitrary and not sufficiently supported by observational evidence .",
    "they are only intended as numerical experiments to test their effect on the derived magnitudes .",
