    "stellar population analysis has recently shown increasing power in constraining galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "this follows the relative success of cdm cosmologies , giving rise to the hierarchical build - up of galaxies as a consequence of the initial conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many structural and dynamical properties of galaxies in clusters are explained in this scenario , though problems remain : for instance , the absence of the predicted mass cusps in the centres of ellipticals and bulges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the prediction of far more satellite galaxies than those observed @xcite .",
    "stellar populations offer a fossil record of the star formation and chemical evolution of galaxies , most clearly in elliptical galaxies , thought to have formed by the merging of discs , so stellar population studies provide very strong constraints on these galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "for example , it is particularly hard to reconcile the hierarchical models with the result that massive galaxies show significantly older mean luminosity weighted ages than their smaller counterparts @xcite .",
    "a basis for population analysis is the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) .",
    "@xcite showed that luminous elliptical galaxies are redder than fainter ones .",
    "the monolithic explanation is that more massive galaxies produce more metals at an early phase @xcite , implying old stellar populations in elliptical galaxies . on the contrary , in the hierarchical explanation",
    "the metals are produced over an extended period in merger induced star formation , so an intermediate age population should be detectable @xcite .",
    "the results so far are ambiguous : @xcite found evidence for the former , while @xcite and @xcite for the latter .",
    "it is hard to separate age from metallicity effects using the cmr @xcite and this bedevils all analyses of unresolved stellar populations .",
    "many studies of clusters have used the pioneering lick / ids spectral indices @xcite whose reliablity is limited by their resolution dependence as uncertain corrections for broadening and instrumental effects are needed @xcite .",
    "one can make some advance by using modelled integrated spectra , which can be broadened to match the galaxy velocity dispersion , sigma ( although indices are still used in this method , one has more flexibility that with the fitting functions required in the earlier technique ) .",
    "models employing the use of integrated spectra at relatively high resolution have been developed by @xcite which allow one to effect a better separation of age and metallicity than with the lick indices @xcite .",
    "another advantage we have in the present work is that we have been able to employ the new stellar population synthesis models of vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) which are improved versions of the earlier @xcite models , based on a greatly extended stellar spectral library , miles @xcite .",
    "the new library contains spectra of over 1000 stars , convering unequalled ranges in stellar metallicity and spectral class in the wavelength range lambdalambda @xmath7  , at a resolution of 2.3    ( fwhm ) .",
    "this new generation of models has shown considerable ability to break the age metallicity degeneracy and has been succesfully applied to a number of elliptical galaxies selected using the cmr of the virgo cluster .",
    "once the age metallicity degeneracy is resolved , it is fairly easy to derive the abundances of individual elements using these models .",
    "for example , @xcite have found that luminous and moderately - luminous ellipticals ( @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10  mag ; @xmath11  km  s@xmath6 ) are essentially old ( t @xmath12 8 - 10 gyr ) without a clear trend with luminosity .",
    "[ mg / h ] correlates tightly with velocity dispersion , while [ fe / h ] is showing only a modest trend , implying that the cmr is driven essentially by metallicity ( in particular , by the abundance of the @xmath13-enhanced elements ) and that star formation in massive ellipticals virtually had stopped before snia started to contaminate the ism with iron - group elements . in short , star formation was intense and short - lived ( @xmath14 gyr ) .",
    "admittedly , however , the number of ellipticals observed in this way is small and the results may not be statistically significant .",
    "contrary to these findings , @xcite found a few young moderately massive ellipticals in coma .",
    "@xcite analyzed integrated spectra of 175 nearby early - type galaxies ( mixture of field and virgo e , de , s0 , and ds0 s ) to find a trend between the population age and the velocity dispersion , such that low-@xmath1 galaxies have younger luminosity - weighted mean ages .",
    "it is therefore not yet clear if cluster ellipticals with @xmath11  km  s@xmath6 are uniformly old or are progressively younger towards less massive objects @xcite .",
    "one of the key pieces of information is to see how abundance ratios in early - type galaxies vary with the cluster masses ( as sampled via their richness class or their x - ray luminosities , for example ) and , in this way , obtain vital insights into galaxy assembly timescales , as functions of their environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , overabundances of [ mg / fe ] compared with the solar ratio have been found in massive elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "these have been interpreted via several possible scenarios based on the fact that mg is mainly produced in type ii supernovae @xcite , and include different star formation rates ( sfr ) and a time dependent initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "based on sdss data , we followed this approach previously @xcite , testing the evolution of the ratios between cn , mg and fe as a function of the cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "we tentatively concluded that early - type galaxies are fully assembled on timescales around the epoch of the massive release of cn into the ism .",
    "this timescale is shorter than predicted by classical hierarchical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus it is vital to test this conclusion .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the stellar population analysis of 27 elliptical galaxies distributed in 4 rich , intermediate - redshift ( @xmath0 ) abell clusters : a115 , a655 , a963 and a2111 .",
    "selected cluster galaxies have been morphologically and photometrically studied in the literature , so we focused on those galaxies already classified as ellipticals .",
    "we determined mean luminosity - weighted ages and a number of abundance ratios of species such as fe , cn and mg ; and their relation with the velocity dispersion of the galaxies . finally , we compared our results with those obtained by other authors in galaxies belonging to less rich clusters such as virgo and coma .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section 2 presents the observations , sample selection and data reduction .",
    "section 3 shows the relations found between the abundances of selected elements and the velocity dispersion , and the comparison with results obtained in less dense environments .",
    "section 4 presents the discussion of our results .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes our conclusions .    where necessary",
    ", we adopt a cosmological model with h@xmath15=71 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath16=0.3 and @xmath17=0.7 .",
    "we have studied a set of 27 elliptical galaxies belonging to 4 very rich ( richness class 3 and @xmath18  erg  s@xmath6 ; * ? ? ? * ) abell clusters : a115 , a655 , a963 and a2111 .",
    "table [ clusterproperties ] presents detailed information on each cluster .",
    "we have selected these clusters because they represent very dense environments , since our aim is to compare the results of the stellar population analysis performed on galaxies in very rich clusters with the results already obtained in less rich clusters , such as virgo ( richness class 1 and @xmath19  erg  s@xmath6 ; * ? ? ? * ) or coma ( richness class 2 and @xmath20  erg  s@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) clusters .",
    "a115 presents 2 main x - ray substructures , which suggests that this cluster is not relaxed but in an intermediate dynamical stage of merging prior to virialization @xcite .",
    "a similar scenario can be traced for a655 , which presents various substructures @xcite , and for a2111 , which shows a double - peaked core @xcite .",
    "a very different situation is found for a963 which , even though a high @xmath21 cluster , is a quite relaxed system with some possible very small - scale structure in the core @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        once we have obtained estimates of the relative abundances of selected elements , and the mean luminosity - weighted age for each galaxy , we studied their relation to the galactic mass , via the velocity dispersion .",
    "figure [ abundancessigma ] presents the relations [ cn / h]@xmath2 , [ mg / h]@xmath2 , [ fe / h]@xmath2 and log(age)@xmath2 for our full sample . the solid line in each panel corresponds to an error - weighted linear fit to the data .",
    "we can see that the abundances [ cn / h ] and [ mg / h ] increase with @xmath1 . on the contrary",
    ", we find no clear trends with @xmath1 for [ fe / h ] or the age .    in order to compare our results from galaxies in very rich clusters with those from galaxies within less dense environments ,",
    "we have also plotted on figure [ abundancessigma ] the results obtained by @xcite , who analyzed a sample of 98 early - type galaxies belonging to the virgo and coma clusters .",
    "the dotted line in each panel corresponds to the relation found for the virgo cluster galaxies , while the dashed line corresponds to the coma cluster galaxies .",
    "note that the sigma coverage is limited to @xmath22  km  s@xmath6 for the virgo and coma cluster samples .        in agreement with our findings ,",
    "[ cn / h ] and [ mg / h ] are correlated with @xmath1 for the virgo and coma cluster galaxies .",
    "also , no clear trend is found for [ fe / h]@xmath2 .",
    "when we consider the age , the result differs from virgo to coma : while virgo galaxies show a clear trend with @xmath1 , none is found for the denser coma cluster . in particular , we observe that the behaviour of the log(age)@xmath2 relation is very similar for the coma galaxies and for our sample .    note that , in the bottom panel of figure [ abundancessigma ] , there is an offset between the log(age)@xmath2 relation for our cluster sample and the virgo and coma ones .",
    "this is not a critical issue since we are only interested in the slopes of the correlations , and not in their absolute values .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of the relative age values does give useful information .",
    "this is also the case for derived metallicity values : we do not expect to obtain absolute values of [ m / h ] , since we based our analysis on the relative ones .",
    "we have focused so far on the relative abundances of selected elements . however , in order to obtain information concerning characteristic formation timescales for the bulk of their stellar populations , we computed the abundance ratios [ cn / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] . since each element",
    "was ejected into the ism by different types of stars at different epochs , their relative abundance values will be very useful for constraining the star formation history .",
    "figure [ abundanceratios ] presents the relations of the abundance ratios [ cn / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] with the velocity dispersion in our sample .",
    "the solid line in each panel corresponds to an error - weighted linear fit to the data .",
    "we observe positive trends with @xmath1 for both abundance ratios [ cn / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] .    as in the previous relations",
    ", we compared our results with those obtained in virgo and coma clusters .",
    "figure [ abundanceratios ] shows the results .",
    "the dotted line in each panel corresponds to the relation found for virgo cluster galaxies , while the dashed line corresponds to coma cluster galaxies . in this case",
    ", we also see correlations of both [ cn / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] with @xmath1 .",
    "we have also compared our result with the [ mg / fe]@xmath2 relation for virgo cluster galaxies found by @xcite , which is represented in bottom panel of figure [ abundanceratios ] by a dashed - dotted line .",
    "figure [ slopes ] presents the slopes of the above z@xmath2 relations ( where z represents any of the abundance ratios above ) as a function of the cluster x - ray luminosity , which is a good indicator of the cluster mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a useful representative of its richness class . this way we can compare the strength of the full set of relations as a function of the environment . figures [ slopes]a to [ slopes]d present the slopes of the relations [ cn / h]@xmath2 , [ mg / h]@xmath2 , [ fe / h]@xmath2 and log(age)@xmath2 as functions of @xmath21 , for our sample and for the virgo and coma cluster galaxies . for the slope of the [ cn / h]@xmath2 relation , we observe a clear trend of the slopes to increase with the density of the environment . on the contrary , when considering the slopes of the [ mg / h]@xmath2 relation we do not find a clear trend with the environment , all slopes being almost constant and positive .",
    "in addition , the [ fe / h]@xmath2 relation presents slopes close to zero independently of the properties of the host cluster .",
    "different behaviour is found for the relation of the slope of log(age)@xmath2 as a function of the environment . in this case ,",
    "our results suggest that this slope is anticorrelated with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "finally , figures [ slopes]e and [ slopes]f present the dependence of the slopes of the [ cn / fe]@xmath2 and [ mg / fe]@xmath2 relations , on the cluster @xmath21 .",
    "we can observe that , for both abundance ratios , the slopes are positive .",
    "in addition , the slope of the [ cn / fe]@xmath2 relation increases with the cluster mass , while the slope of the [ mg / fe]@xmath2 relation is nearly constant , though positive , within the errors .",
    "in this section we will try to explain within a common scenario all the trends found . in particular , the correlations can be interpreted in terms of the different formation timescales for each chemical element , and the different star formation histories of elliptical galaxies as a function of their environment .",
    "magnesium is ejected into the interstellar medium ( ism ) by type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) on short timescales ( @xmath23  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , the iron - peak elements are the products of sne  ia , which occur on timescales of @xmath3  gyr . between the two extremes , although there are recent suggestions that most of the c comes from massive stars @xcite , c and n are mainly ejected into the ism by low- and intermediate - mass stars @xcite , leading to cn formation on timescales longer than that for mg but shorter than that for fe . several authors",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) argue that early - type galaxies are old and passively evolving systems .",
    "the luminosity - weighted ages derived from our model grids confirm that the galaxies are significantly older than the formation timescales of the different species .",
    "so , if we find substantial differences in the abundance ratios of these elements which depend on the physical properties of the environment , these must be due to the fact that galaxies are assembled on different timescales as a function of their environment .",
    "we will focus our discussion on the following three aspects :    * the comparison of the relative abundances and abundance ratios measured in galaxies of the _ same _ mass ( i.e. equal velocity disperion ) in _ different _ environments . * the comparison of the stellar population properties measured in galaxies of _ different _ mass within the _ same _ environment . * the dependence of above relations as functions of the galaxy mass , with the environment properties .    first , when inspecting figures [ abundancessigma ] and [ abundanceratios ] we observe that , for a given @xmath1 , the relative abundance [ cn / h ] increases with the cluster x - ray luminosity , whereas [ mg / h ] and [ fe / h ] do not .",
    "something similar happens with the abundance ratios : while [ cn / fe ] increases as a function of the environment density , the [ mg / fe ] ratio keeps constant and _ positive_. we interprete the fact that [ mg / fe ] is positive and constant in terms of the formation timescales of the stars in ellipticals , as a function of the environment .",
    "if we consider the formation timescales for mg and fe stated above we can estimate that , whatever the environment is , all stellar populations in ellipticals should be already formed in less than @xmath3  gyr , since this is the time needed by sne  ia to pollute the ism with iron - peak elements .",
    "but , if we consider species with less separated formation timescales , such as fe and cn , we do find differences in the ratio [ cn / fe ] as a function of the environment , for a given @xmath1 . that suggests a different formation timescale for the stars in ellipticals related to the environment properties , in the sense that the more dense the environment is the shorter the formation timescales of the stars are ( with an upper limit of @xmath3  gyr ) .",
    "this is in agreeement with a number of recent results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , for our sample of galaxies in very rich clusters , we do find positive trends between [ cn / h ] , [ mg / h ] , [ cn / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] and @xmath1 . on the contrary",
    ", no correlations are found between [ fe / h ] or log(age ) with the velocity dispersion .",
    "these relations are explained within a framework where more massive galaxies produce more metals @xcite .",
    "our results are compatible with those of @xcite , who found a relation between the abundance of some @xmath13-elements , including mg , and the velocity dispersion for a sample of old cluster galaxies .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite suggested that the cmr is driven essentially by metallicity and , in particular , by the abundance of the @xmath13-enhanced elements .    the log(age)@xmath2 relation presented in figure [ abundancessigma ] and the slopes of figure [ slopes]d show that the mean stellar age is nearly constant for all galaxies within rich clusters .",
    "this is not the case for the virgo cluster galaxies , which present bigger ages for the most massive objects .",
    "this is due to the fact that smaller galaxies in low density environments present a larger scatter in the age@xmath2 relation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the slope in age@xmath2 for the virgo cluster is also near zero if the sample is limited to galaxies with sigma larger than 200  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "third , it is noteworthy that the slope of the relation [ cn / fe]@xmath2 increases with the cluster x - ray luminosity while the slope of the [ mg / fe]@xmath2 is constant with the cluster mass ( see figure [ slopes ] ) . because of that",
    ", we can only find environment - related [ cn / fe ] differences in those galaxies with @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 whereas , for more massive galaxies , the [ cn / fe ] values are almost equal independently of the cluster properties .",
    "this means that the ratio [ cn / fe ] in most massive galaxies is less sensitive to the environment than in intermediate- and low - mass galaxies , suggesting that star formation histories are less environment dependent as the galaxy mass increases .",
    "therefore , [ cn / fe ] appears to be an appropriate `` chemical clock '' for ellipticals with @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 but , when we move to very massive galaxies , the formation timescales differ so gently from one environment to another that this `` clock '' turns out to be insufficiently sensitive . in order to disentangle the different formation timescales between very massive galaxies in different environments , it is neccesary to find out a more accurate indicator .",
    "our results suggest an overall picture in which massive elliptical galaxies in very rich clusters are old systems , with very short star formation histories , and which have been passively evolving since , at least , @xmath4 .",
    "this is in agreement with a number recent results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in comparison with less dense environments , the stars in elliptical galaxies of rich clusters",
    "must have formed at slightly earlier epochs and on a slightly shorter timescales .",
    "we have performed a detailed stellar population analysis of a sample of 27 massive elliptical galaxies ( 220  km  s@xmath24  km  s@xmath6 ) within 4 very rich abell clusters : a115 , a655 , a963 and a2111 . from the absorption indices",
    "h@xmath25 , cn2 , mg@xmath26 and fe4383 we derived mean luminosity - weighted ages , relative abundances [ cn / h ] , [ mg / h ] and [ fe / h ] , and the abundance ratios [ cn / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] . to obtain these results we used our new , high - resolution stellar population models ( vazdekis et al 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "we obtained the dependences of all parameters above on the galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "given the different formation timescales for each element , we have shown that the abundance ratios [ cn / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] are the key `` chemical clocks '' for infering the star formation history timescales in ellipticals .",
    "in particular , [ mg / fe ] provides an upper limit for those formation timescales , while [ cn / fe ] apperars to be the most suitable `` clock '' to discriminate finely among them .",
    "this is true for those galaxies with @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 as , for more massive galaxies , the [ cn / fe ] ratio loses its  timing  sensitivity .",
    "our [ mg / fe ] results are compatible with a scenario in which the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies , independently of their environment and mass , had formation timescales shorter than @xmath3  gyr .",
    "this result implies that massive elliptical galaxies have evolved passively since , at least , @xmath4 .    on the other hand",
    ", the information provided by the [ cn / fe ] analysis suggests that , for a given galaxy mass ( i.e. a given velocity dispersion ) , the star formation history must be shorter in those galaxies belonging to more dense environments .",
    "furthermore , we found that these timescales differences become smaller for the most massive cluster galaxies ( @xmath27  km  s@xmath6 ) , so they can not be traced by the [ cn / fe ] abundance ratio .",
    "finally , we found that the mass - metallicity relation is steeper as the density of the environment increases .",
    "our results do not allow us , at this point , to decide between the two principal scenarios , hierarchical or monolithic , for galaxy formation , but do set certain strong constraints .",
    "specifically , we have shown that galaxy assembly timescales for ellipticals are short and environment dependent , and this must be addressed by any valid theory of galaxy formation .",
