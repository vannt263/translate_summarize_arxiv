    "* ) despite being less luminous and having shorter scale lengths .",
    "this thicker ms component may be related to the thicker dust distribution seen in low mass galaxies by @xcite . finally , the axial ratio of the rgb component ( @xmath17 ) shown in the last column of table  2 ranges from 1.0 to 3.3 .",
    "this axial ratio is similar to the milky way thick disk ( using data from e.g * ? ? ?",

    "in this section we use the color of the rgb stars to determine the metallicity of the extraplanar stellar population .",
    "the left panel of figure  5 shows the composite cmd of stars above 4@xmath9 in all the galaxies excepting the ngc  4631 fields ( which have completeness limits that are too high for rgb metallicity analysis ) .",
    "overplotted are 10 gyr padova isochrones at [ fe / h ] values ranging between -2.3 and 0.0 .",
    "the peak of the distribution lies between the isochrones with [ fe / h ] of -1.3 and -0.7 indicating that the dominant population in these galaxies at high latitudes is moderately metal - poor .",
    "we determined a metallicity distribution function for each galaxy using three bins in absolute magnitude shown with dotted lines in the left panel of figure  5 . in each bin",

    "the other four galaxies have similar mdfs , with peaks ranging between [ fe / h ] of -0.7 and -1.1 .",
    "this peak metallicity also agrees with metallicities found for extraplanar stars in other studies of galaxies in the same mass range @xcite .",

    "we note that the current metallicity of these galaxies is somewhat subsolar @xcite , furthering the idea that the peak metallicites of [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1 are consistent with the presence of a thick disk similar to the milky way s .",

    "the high metallicity cutoff suggests that the star formation trucated before all the gas was consumed , as would be expected for any of the thick disk scenarios discussed in the introduction . at low metallicities ,",
    "the deficit of stars may be a manifestation of the g - dwarf problem . however , our results at the low metallicity end are quite uncertain since the close spacing of the isochrones means photometric errors introduce large uncertainties in the metallicity .    models for the origin of thin and thick disks predict different degrees of variation in the stellar metallicity with height above the plane",
    ". we can observe any such trend in our galaxies by examining the median color of the rgb stars as a function of height above the midplane .",
    "figure  6 shows the median rgb color vs. disk height for each of the galaxies in our sample ( except ngc  4631 ) . at low disk heights ,",
    "internal reddening may impact the color of stars - this is shown as the hatched region . above this height , from @xmath03 - 10@xmath9 ( @xmath01 - 2 kpc ) , the galaxies show very little variation in rgb color suggesting nearly uniform metallicity with increasing disk height .",
    "recent observations by @xcite of extraplanar stars in similar galaxies also find a lack of strong metallicity gradients .",
    "we discuss the implications of this further in the next section .",
    "we have shown above that in our sample of six edge - on , low mass , late type galaxies :    * stars exist at large heights above the disk plane . *",
    "the scale height of a stellar population increases with age in each galaxy .",
    "the young ( ms ) stellar population has a larger scale height than young stars in the milky way , while the old rgb population has an axial ratio similar to the milky way thick disk .",
    "* extraplanar rgb stars have a peak metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1 .",
    "in addition there appears to be little gradient in the metallicity at moderate ( 1 - 2 kpc ) disk heights .    in the milky way",
    ", it is widely accepted that the age - dependent scale height in the thin disk is a result of slow disk heating , while the thick disk is thought to be formed by some type of merger event .",
    "we now consider our results in light of this scenario .    _",
    "disk heating : _ the steady increase in scale height with stellar population age suggests that some kind of disk heating is occurring in our sample galaxies .",
    "we can use our measured scale heights to constrain the rate of disk heating in these galaxies . for an isothermal sech@xmath12 profile ,",
    "the scale height of a stellar population is proportional to the square of the vertical velocity dispersion ( @xmath19 ) . in the milky way ,",
    "the rate of disk heating is usually expressed as a power law , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ranging between 0.3 and 0.6 @xcite . using the ages for our stellar population boxes derived from the constant star - formation rate synthetic cmds , we find that the rate of disk heating is much lower , with @xmath21 being no larger than 0.15 ( see paper  ii for more details ) .",
    "this is not surprising given our galaxies likely have fewer molecular clouds and weaker spiral arms .",
    "based on this slow heating rate , it is plausible that disk heating can account for the observed variation of scale height .",
    "however , a model in which steady disk heating accounts for all of the extraplanar stars would predict the existence of intermediate - age rgb stars with higher metallicities and lower scale heights leading to a decreasing metallicity with increasing disk height .",
    "the lack of such a trend in our galaxies suggests that a majority of rgb stars at all disk heights formed early and with a well - mixed metallicity distribution .",
    "this strongly suggests that mergers or interactions played a role in the formation of these rgb stars .",
    "_ merger & interactions : _ the thick disk in the milky way is thought to have formed in a merger event ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , and recent dynamical observations of a counter - rotating thick disk in fgc  227 by @xcite also strongly suggests a merger origin . in our sample galaxies , the lack of metallicity gradient and the similarity of the axial ratio and metallicity of the rgb population to the milky way thick disk suggests that mergers or interactions likely have played an important role in the early history of these galaxies .",
    "further evidence to support this claim comes from the heterogeneity of scale heights we observe .",
    "although all the galaxies in our sample show a similar trend towards increasing scale height with age , in some galaxies the rgb component is significantly thicker than in others despite having similar circular velocity / mass .",
    "this variation would be a natural consequence of the stochastic merging process .",
    "overall , our results require that some disk heating occurs at intermediate ages ( to puff up the agb component ) , but that events at earlier times ( interactions or mergers ) created a majority of the rgb stars over a short period of time . in future work",
    ", we will focus on the globular cluster systems of our sample galaxies which will provide us with additional evidence on their history and assembly .",
    "the authors would like to thank andrew dolphin and antonio aparicio for their help in generating synthetic cmds and leo girardi for supplying us with isochrones .",
