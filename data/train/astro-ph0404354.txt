    "diffuse x - ray emission from the solar system was clearly observed during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) as a background component with temporal variations on scales from a large fraction of a day to many days .",
    "these variations were dubbed long - term enhancements ( ltes , @xcite ) , and provided a significant background particularly at @xmath6  kev .",
    "although the origin of these ltes at the time was unknown , the ltes were associated with solar wind parameters @xcite . with the observation of x - rays from comets @xcite , emission from solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) between solar wind ions and neutral material within the heliosphere",
    "was demonstrated @xcite .",
    "swcx emission subsequently was suggested as the origin for ltes @xcite , and has recently been suggested as being responsible in quiescence for a significant fraction of diffuse x - ray emission at @xmath6  kev  @xcite previously attributed to the local hot bubble @xcite .",
    "more recently , evidence for geocoronal emission ( swcx with exospheric material ) has been detected in _",
    "observations of the dark moon @xcite .",
    "this emission clearly originates in the near - earth environment , which is consistent with the likely production of x - rays from the terrestrial magnetosheath @xcite .",
    "the statistics of the dark moon data are somewhat limited but they clearly show excess o  vii  and o  viii  emission .",
    "analysis of cometary x - ray spectra suggest that solar wind charge state composition and speed affect the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "thus through a combination of techniques , including x - ray and neutral atom imaging among others , it may be possible to continuously monitor the solar wind from well inside earth s magnetosphere .",
    "however , the nature of solar system x - ray emission is strongly dependent on the point of view of the observer . while the observation of swcx x - ray emission samples aspects of the solar system of interest to astronomers",
    ", the emission can also provide a contaminating component which strongly impacts observations of extended cosmic x - ray sources .",
    "the swcx emission spectrum is dominated by highly ionized carbon , oxygen , neon , possibly iron , and magnesium lines , which are also of great astrophysical interest .",
    "( the oxygen lines are particularly important as they are commonly used for temperature and density diagnostics of thermal emission from diffuse plasmas . ) for objects at zero redshift ( i.e. , emission from the milky way and nearby galaxies ) where the emission is expected to fill the entire field of view of the detector , swcx emission is indistinguishable from that of the object , except to the extent that temporal variation can be detected .    while there is likely to be swcx emission at some quiescent level @xcite , the strongest emission will be associated with flux enhancements of the solar wind .",
    "these enhancements are long enough in duration that they can `` contaminate '' an entire observation , but variable enough that if there are multiple observations of a single target they can be identified , at least to some level .",
    "this was the basis of the lte `` cleaning '' of the rass @xcite , and of _ rosat _ pointed observations which were typically distributed over the period of a few days if not weeks @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report the detection of swcx emission during an _ xmm - newton _ observation of the _ hubble _ deep field north .",
    "we correlate that detection with a concurrent enhancement in the solar wind density observed by advanced composition explorer ( _ ace _ ) , solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) , and _ wind_. in ",
    "[ sec : data ] we present the data , data reduction , and analysis , in   [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the results , and in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we detail our conclusions both in regards to the emission itself and the implications for x - ray observations of more distant objects .",
    "the swcx emission discussed in this paper was observed in the fourth ( 2001 june 12 ) _ xmm - newton _ pointing of the _ hubble _ deep field north ( hdf - n , @xmath7 , a project guaranteed time observation ) .",
    "because of satellite constraints and the total length of the observation , it was broken into four segments ( pointings ) , which were scheduled over a period of 16 days ( table  [ tbl : observations ] gives the specifics of the pointings ) .",
    "because of this multiple coverage , the length of the individual pointings , and relative freedom from other non - cosmic backgrounds ( most critically the soft proton flaring ) , the hdf - n observation was chosen as a test case for a new non - cosmic background modeling and subtraction method for _ xmm - newton _ epic data @xcite . the serendipitous detection of the swcx emission came from that testing .",
    "outside of time intervals obviously affected by proton flaring ( which were removed for this analysis ) , the light curves for the observations were reasonably flat indicating at least a low if not zero level of residual flaring .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the x - ray light curves for the non - flaring periods of the fourth observation , and also includes the _ ace _ data ( discussed below ) .",
    "the light curve for the 28  kev band is relatively constant but the 0.520.75  kev band ( covering the o  vii  and most of the o  viii  lines ) shows a significant drop in the last quarter of the interval .",
    "we used this light curve to separate the spectrum into high and low states at @xmath8  s in figure  [ fig : lc ] ( 22:39:38 ut on 2001 june 1 ; @xmath9 seconds after 0  ut , 1998 january 1 , in the _ xmm - newton _ time reference system ) .",
    "table  [ tbl : observations ] also lists the average count rates in the 0.520.75  kev and 28  kev bands for the different pointings .",
    "the 28  kev band count rate is reasonably consistent among all of the pointings , as is the average count rate for the 0.520.75  kev band , except for the time period affected by the swcx emission .",
    "the minor , but greater - than - statistical scatter of the x - ray count rates in table  [ tbl : observations ] during the non - swcx periods is likely due to the contribution of the unsubtracted particle background which is temporally variable , and/or variations in the residual swcx emission .",
    "data from the full field of view were used in this analysis .",
    "they were conservatively filtered by screening the events using the parameters `` flag==0 '' and `` pattern@xmath10=12 '' ( only the best events selected by position and limiting the ccd pixel pattern to legitimate quadruple and lower pixel - number events ) . the non - cosmic background was modeled using the method of @xcite , which is currently limited to the epic mos data ( i.e. , excludes data from the epic pn detector ) .",
    "the nominal non - cosmic background , which is dominated by the quiescent high - energy particle - induced background , is modeled using closed filter data scaled by data from the unexposed corners of the detectors in the individual observation .",
    "the scaling is energy dependent and based on the hardness and intensity of the corner data ( which are temporally variable ) .",
    "this background modeling removes most of the non - cosmic background but unfortunately leaves untouched any backgrounds ( particle or x - ray ) originating in , or passing down the telescope tube ( i.e. , backgrounds which are blocked by the detector mask used in the closed - filter data collection ) .",
    "most notably there are strong fluorescent al  k@xmath11 and si  k@xmath11 lines , and the possibility of soft protons at some quiescent level .    after background subtraction ,",
    "the spectra from the full field of view of the first three hdf - n pointings and the low state of the fourth were reasonably statistically consistent , while the high - state data from the fourth pointing showed a strong enhancement at energies less than 1.4  kev ( consistent with the light curve ) , which was dominated by line emission .",
    "the spectra at higher energies of all four pointings ( including both high and low states of the fourth ) were consistent with each other as expected from their average count rates ( table  [ tbl : observations ] ) .",
    "for the spectral fits of the _ xmm - newton _ x - ray data we used spectral redistribution matrices ( rmfs ) and effective areas ( arfs ) produced by the project standard analysis software ( sas ) package ( version 5.4.1 ) .",
    "xspec ( version 11.2 , @xcite ) was used to fit a model of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , swcx line emission ( a number of discrete lines ) , probable residual soft proton contamination ( represented by a power law not folded through the instrumental efficiency ) , and the two instrumental lines ( al  k@xmath11 and si  k@xmath11 ) to the data after subtraction of the modeled non - cosmic background . in order to constrain the cosmic contribution to the spectrum , we simultaneously fit rass data provided through the heasarc x - ray background tool , which uses data from @xcite to create xspec compatible spectra for selected directions on the sky .",
    "the spatial distribution of the cxb emission within the observed field , which includes the hdf - n , is relatively simple ( by design there are no significantly bright point sources or extended objects in the field ) , and can be modeled using the four standard components listed in @xcite : a cooler unabsorbed thermal component with @xmath12  kev representing emission from the local hot bubble ( e.g. , @xcite ) , an absorbed cooler thermal component also with @xmath12  kev representing emission from the lower halo , an absorbed hotter thermal component with @xmath13  kev representing milky way halo or local group emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and an absorbed power law with a spectral index of 1.46 representing the unresolved emission of agn and other cosmological objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption was fixed to the galactic column density of h  i   ( @xmath14  @xmath15 ) .",
    "the spectral fitting was done simultaneously for eleven spectra : mos1 and mos2 data from the four observations with two spectra ( high and low states ) for the fourth observation , plus the rass spectrum .",
    "the cxb model was fit to all spectra with no scaling between the different instruments besides the normalization for solid angle , which was fixed .",
    "the instrumental lines and soft - proton power law were fit only to the mos data .",
    "the normalizations were allowed to differ between the mos1 and mos2 detectors but were constrained to be the same for all observations .",
    "the lines representing the swcx were fit only to the mos data from the high state of the fourth observation with the fit parameters constrained to be the same for the mos1 and mos2 data .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows the results with the excess emission attributed to swcx being clearly visible .",
    "the aluminum and silicon instrumental lines are the strong peaks at 1.49  kev and 1.74  kev , respectively .",
    "the swcx emission was modeled by a set of gaussians whose widths were set to zero except for the component at @xmath16  kev which covers multiple lines from o  viii  and possible lines from fe  xvii .",
    "the fitted line strengths are listed in table  [ tbl : flux ] .",
    "two gaussian lines with energies less than 0.5  kev were included in the fits , which can be associated with emission from highly ionized carbon ( c  vi  at 0.37  kev and 0.46  kev ) .",
    "they are included in table  [ tbl : flux ] with the following caveats . at energies less than 0.5",
    "kev the energy resolution and effective areas of the mos instruments fall off significantly and while the additional lines are necessary for reasonable fits ( @xmath17 when one line is removed , @xmath18 when both lines are removed ) the specific energies of the lines are not well constrained .",
    "however , there is no degrading of the quality of the fit when the line energies are fixed at the c  vi  values , and once the energies are fixed fluxes can be measured at better than the 3@xmath19 level .",
    "still , lines at other energies may fit the data as well so the attribution of the emission to c  vi  is not certain , it is however reasonable ( cf .",
    "note , however , that the addition of the c  v  line at 0.30  kev ( also listed in @xcite ) did not improve the quality of the fit .",
    "the power - law background component , which is assumed to represent residual soft proton contamination , was added to bring consistency between the rass and mos data . because this power law is best fit without being folded through the mos effective area , it is not due to x - rays originating externally to the satellite as they would be cut off at lower energies by the filter .",
    "the effective flux in this component is @xmath20  ergs  @xmath15  sr@xmath21  s@xmath21 while the flux of the cosmic background model is @xmath22  ergs  @xmath15  sr@xmath21  s@xmath21 in the 0.25.0  kev band , with @xmath23  ergs  @xmath15  sr@xmath21  s@xmath21 from the extragalactic power law .",
    "figure  [ fig : fold ] shows the mos1 spectra from the first pointing and the high state of the fourth pointing along with the various components to the fit folded through the instrumental response .",
    "the fit to the data is rather good with @xmath24 with 1922 degrees of freedom .",
    "the fitted values for the energies of the lines were consistent with the expected values in initial fits , and were subsequently fixed ( except for the o  viii  and the possible fe complex at @xmath16  kev ) . in general it is possible to move power between one spectral component and another in fits of such complex models as used here .",
    "the fitted parameters of the cosmic background model are , for example , strongly correlated .",
    "however , the measurement of the swcx emission is very robust ( as indicated by the quoted 90% probability statistical errors in the line fluxes listed in table  [ tbl : flux ] ) as the background is so well constrained and the swcx emission is in a limited number of discrete lines .        solar wind speed and flux data from four spacecraft during the period of the hdf - n observations are shown in figure  [ fig : sw ] .",
    "three of them , _ ace _ , _ wind _ , and _",
    "sample the near - earth environment .",
    "_ ace _ and _ soho _ have been , for the most part , located in halo orbits around the sun - earth libration point ( l1 , @xmath25  km , 235  @xmath26 from earth ) .",
    "_ wind _ has led a more peripatetic life and at the time of these measurements was no longer in an orbit around l1 .",
    "_ ace _ was launched on 1997 august 25 , _",
    "soho _ was launched on 1995 december 2 , and _ wind _ was launched 1994 november 1 .",
    "the three spacecraft function , in part , as upstream monitors of the solar wind , the hot ( @xmath27  k ) plasma continually flowing from the sun , and provide almost continual measurements of the solar wind density , speed , and magnetic field , among many other parameters . the fourth spacecraft , _ ulysses _ , follows a high - inclination ( @xmath28 ) , elliptical ( @xmath29 with a semi - major axis of @xmath30  au ) orbit around the sun .",
    "_ ulysses _ was launched 1990 october 6 and reached its roughly polar orbit after a fly - by of jupiter .    at the time of these measurements , earth was at @xmath31  au , @xmath32 ecliptic latitude , and @xmath33 ecliptic longitude .",
    "the solar wind speed and flux data from the three near - earth spacecraft are in reasonably good agreement showing the same structure ( figure  [ fig : sw ] ) .",
    "the major enhancements in the flux at all three spacecraft are roughly contemporaneous while discrepancies in the fluxes , although typically small but sometimes as much as a factor of two , may be in part due to the sometimes large separation ( @xmath34 ) between the spacecraft perpendicular to the sun - earth line .",
    "( note that the deviation of _ ace _ near day 9 in figure  [ fig : sw ] is due to missing data . ) on the other hand _",
    "ulysses _ , which is in a polar orbit around the sun , at this time was @xmath35  au from the sun with an ecliptic latitude of @xmath36 and an ecliptic longitude of about @xmath37 .",
    "this location is farther from the sun than the other spacecraft and @xmath38 ahead of the earth .",
    "thus , the ulysses flux in figure  [ fig : sw ] is only qualitatively similar to that observed near earth and shifted in time .",
    "these differences reflect the large scale structure of the interplanetary medium at this time . in addition , the _ ulysses _ direction was @xmath39 away from the hdf - n , and so is not particularly relevant for the swcx observation , but the comparison of the data provides an illustration of the variation of the solar wind from a uniform shell - like expansion .",
    "although there exists considerable variability , solar wind speeds are typically about 450  km  s@xmath21 ( about 1 kev / nucleon ) with fluxes at 1  au of about @xmath40  @xmath15  s@xmath21 @xcite . the solar wind by is about 95% protons and 4% helium nuclei by number .",
    "high charge state heavy ions ( i.e. , other than protons and he@xmath41 ) comprise less than 1% of the solar wind by number .",
    "these ions include carbon , dominated by charge states c@xmath42 and c@xmath5 , oxygen , dominated by charge states o@xmath5 and o@xmath4 , neon dominated by charge state ne@xmath43 , and iron with a wide range of charge states sometimes as high as fe@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the solar wind source ion for the c  vi  lines in the x - ray spectrum is c@xmath5 and the source ions for the o  vii  and o  viii  lines are o@xmath4 and o@xmath43 , respectively .",
    "although typically the dominant charge states of solar wind oxygen are + 6 and + 7 , under certain conditions , e.g. , in the cme - related solar wind ( coronal mass ejection ) , o@xmath43 can be comparable to and even dominate the o@xmath4 @xcite . ne@xmath45 and mg@xmath46 , the solar wind source ions for ne",
    "ix  and mg  xi  swcx emission , have also been observed in the solar wind ( a. b. galvin , private communication ) .",
    "o  viii  and ne  ix  lines have been observed in cometary spectra @xcite    during the period of the 2001 june 1 - 2 _ xmm - newton _ hdf - n pointing , the _ ace _ level  2 data show that the o@xmath4/o@xmath5 ratio was highly variable ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) compared to the first three pointings .",
    "the average ratio was enhanced by over a factor of two during the period when the swcx emission was detected , and dropped by nearly an order of magnitude at the end of the pointing concurrent with the reduction in solar wind flux ( table  [ tbl : ace ] ) .",
    "this large increase in the relative abundance of the higher ionization state during the swcx period might suggest that the relative abundances of the ionization states of o@xmath43 , ne@xmath45 , and mg@xmath46 may also be significantly enhanced .",
    "thus observation of swcx emission from these species would be reasonable .",
    "however , preliminary results from _ ace _ indicate that the o@xmath43/o@xmath4 ratio was actually relatively low at @xmath47 during the period of swcx emission ( zurbuchen & raines , private communication ; the analysis continues ) .",
    "the picture becomes even more murky as the preliminary results also show the o@xmath43/o@xmath4 ratio increasing by a factor of 20 to 30 just as the swcx emission and solar wind flux enhancement were cutting off .",
    "in addition , the ( 0.720.61  kev)/(0.520.61  kev ) count rate ratio , which is a measure of the relative emission of o  viii  and o  vii , was consistent with a constant value ( @xmath48 for 22 degrees of freedom ) over the period of the swcx emission .",
    "this is in spite of the variation in solar wind ionization state distributions .",
    "the temporal variation of the x - ray data requires that the enhancement originates locally , at least in the solar system if not in the satellite / near - earth environment .",
    "the presence of x - ray emission lines corresponding to the highly ionized charge states of oxygen , neon , and magnesium eliminates an origin internal to the satellite , and strongly implicates swcx as the source of the emission enhancement .",
    "furthermore , data from the low energy neutral atom _ lena",
    "_ imager on the _ image _ spacecraft inside the magnetosphere during this event show an enhancement which suggests a neutral solar wind resulting from swcx @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the 2001 june 12 observation with respect to the near - earth environment is shown in figure  [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "the satellite is on the sun side of the earth with an angle of @xmath49 between the sun and look directions .",
    "( due to satellite constraints , the look direction of _ xmm - newton _ must lie within @xmath50 of perpendicular to the earth - sun line . )",
    "the satellite and the observation line of sight are outside of earth s magnetosphere , based on the magnetospheric model of @xcite ( using a ram pressure of 7.4  npa and a northward @xmath51 ) . however , the line of sight may possibly pass through the magnetosheath relatively near the sub - solar point .",
    "such an observation trajectory would sample the region of strongest production of x - rays by swcx with exospheric material @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the trajectory may be entirely outside of the magnetosheath and therefore miss much of that emission .",
    "because of this uncertain geometry , the swcx emission can be from either exospheric material in earth s magnetosheath or from interstellar neutrals in the heliosphere , or more likely both ( at least to some level )",
    ". the detailed analysis of this geometry will be the subject of a following paper .    on a more global scale ( with perhaps no particular relevance to this observation ) , during the time period of the 2001 june 12 observation",
    "the location of earth in its orbit placed it almost directly upstream from the sun relative to the flow of interstellar material through the solar system .",
    "( earth is in the nominal upstream direction about 4  june . )      from table  [ tbl : flux ] and figure  [ fig : spec ] it is clear that the excess emission can be well characterized by a limited number of highly significant lines with energies consistent with those expected from swcx . with certain assumptions it is possible to use the observed x - ray line ratios to derive the concurrent ion ratios .",
    "the fitted o  viii(0.65&0.81  kev)/o  vii(0.56  kev ) line ratio from table  [ tbl : flux ] is 1.09 .",
    "however , from @xcite , the @xmath52 and ( at the 2% level ) o  vii  @xmath53 lines contaminate the o  viii  line at @xmath54  kev , and contribute @xmath55  @xmath15  sr@xmath21  s@xmath21 ( using a factor of 0.079 , derived from the relative intensities of the relevant lines in their table 1 , to scale from the o  vii  0.56  kev flux ) . correcting for this contribution , and assuming that the 0.81  kev emission is all from o  viii   ( see below ) , the o  viii(0.65&0.81  kev)/o  vii(0.56&0.67  kev ) emission ratio is then @xmath56 ( table  [ tbl : oxygen ] ) . to convert the emission ratio to an ion number ratio we use the swcx cross sections in @xcite .",
    "the ratios between the hydrogen and helium swcx cross sections for o@xmath4 and o@xmath43 are roughly the same , so we use the o@xmath43/o@xmath4 hydrogen cross section ratio of 1.66 to scale the flux ratio ( this assumes that the scattering is optically thin and hydrogen is the dominant swcx target neutral ) .",
    "this implies a solar wind o@xmath43/o@xmath4 abundance ratio of @xmath57 , which is somewhat higher than the more typical value of 0.35 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but not unreasonable , as would be expected considering the enhancement of the o@xmath4/o@xmath5 ratio .",
    "however , as noted above , the preliminary o@xmath43/o@xmath4 ratio from _ ace _ for the swcx period is @xmath47 , a significant discrepancy which we will revisit in a subsequent paper when the o@xmath43/o@xmath4 ratio data are more robust .",
    "the energy and non - zero width for the fitted line at @xmath16  kev is consistent with the expected o  viii  ly@xmath58 through ly@xmath59 emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is also the energy of possible fe  xvii  emission .",
    "the ratio of the line strengths , ly@xmath11/ly(@xmath60 ) , predicted by @xcite is 2.75 ( with a @xmath61 uncertianty ) , while our measured ratio is @xmath62 .",
    "the two values are therefore in reasonably good agreement but the result does not rule out a contribution from fe  xvii .",
    "it does suggest that any fe contribution to the observed flux is relatively limited .      as measured by _",
    "ace _ , the solar wind during the 2001 june 12 period was in its `` slow '' state but with with fairly uncharacteristic ion abundances and flux during the enhancement period . at solar maximum",
    ", the solar wind at 1 au shows a complex structure most likely resulting from the appearance of equatorial coronal holes .",
    "in contrast , at solar minimum , there tends to be a two state speed structure observed in the solar wind with fewer but well - formed transients such as coronal mass ejections and corotating interaction regions .",
    "@xcite provide a recent review of the complex variation of the solar wind during the solar cycle .",
    "solar wind fluxes during the first three _ xmm - newton _ hdf - n observations were close to nominal levels ( see figure  [ fig : sw ] ) .",
    "however , during the observation on 2001 june 1 - 2 , the solar wind flux observed by the ace spacecraft was enhanced ( as shown in figures  [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : sw ] ) by a factor of five over its typical value of @xmath63  @xmath15  s@xmath21 .",
    "the average o@xmath4/o@xmath5 ionization state ratios for the observation ( table  [ tbl : ace ] ) were also significantly enhanced .",
    "this flux enhancement was relatively localized ; it lasted 5 - 6 hours at a solar wind speed of @xmath64  km  s@xmath21 implying a width of about 0.05  au in the direction toward the sun .",
    "the x - ray flux decrease at @xmath65 ( 2001 june 1 , 22:30 ut ) and the sharp drop in both the solar wind flux and o@xmath4/o@xmath5 ratio propagated to earth from the l1 point ( a delay of @xmath66  s ) are approximately contemporaneous , which suggests the x - ray flux is responding primarily to local solar wind conditions .",
    "however , comparison of the solar wind flux and ionization state variation and x - ray light curves raises two critical questions .",
    "first , if the swcx emission enhancement observed by _ xmm - newton _ is due to a local phenomena , why is the large variation in solar wind flux not reflected in the x - ray intensity , or in a variation of the relative intensity of the o  vii  and o  viii  emission ?",
    "over the course of 20  ks ( roughly six hours ) the solar wind flux increases by a factor of six while the x - ray light curve is essentially constant ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "if the swcx emission was due solely to interactions with material from earth s exosphere , then the x - ray light curve should be closely linked to the solar wind flux measured by _ ace _ at the l1 point .",
    "@xcite point out that the geometry of the magnetosheath is strongly affected by the density and velocity of the solar wind . with the observation geometry considered by @xcite , i.e. , looking out through the flanks of the magnetosheath , there is some buffering of the x - ray emission which smooths out the effects of strong solar wind enhancements .",
    "however , with the geometry of this observation where the line of sight possibly runs tangentially through their region of maximum x - ray emission near the magnetosheath sub - solar point , the situation is much more confused , and perhaps more likely to produce variations rather than to smooth out the swcx flux .    given the possible difficulty in turning the large variation of the solar wind flux into a relatively constant x - ray light curve , a possible solution might be to distribute the emission along the line of sight through the heliosphere .",
    "this would smooth out temporal variations originating with the solar wind .",
    "however , this brings up the second question . if the emission is distributed through the heliosphere why do the solar wind and x - ray enhancements cut off at nearly the same time ?",
    "note again the large differential variation in the solar wind flux as measured by _",
    "ace _ and _ ulysses _ , up to a factor of 20 , during swcx observation .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry2 ] illustrates the observation geometry on a larger scale . since the pointing direction is @xmath49 from the earth - sun line , the observation samples a relatively long path length through the solar wind enhancement with a heliocentric distance similar to that of the earth . if the solar wind enhancement is a spherically symmetric shell moving outward there should still be a strong enhancement in the swcx emission roughly concurrent with the _ ace _ measurement .",
    "however , even introducing large variations in the density profile and arrival time of the solar wind enhancement as a function of direction from the sun will not in general smooth out the x - ray light curve significantly .",
    "in addition , once the position along the line of sight is greater than 1  au from the sun ( the short dashed part of the line of sight in figure  [ fig : geometry2 ] ) , it is sampling the solar wind enhancement after it would have passed earth , and therefore the x - ray count rate should fall off after the fall - off of the solar wind enhancement as measured at earth .",
    "one might argue that such a fall - off could slow down and therefore not be obvious in the relatively limited lower flux part of the 0.520.75  kev light curve .",
    "however , the absence of o  viii  emission during that period indicates that the swcx emission really has cut off .",
    "the quandary is therefore :",
    "1 ) if the x - ray emission is from the magnetosheath why is it so constant ?",
    "2 ) if the x - ray emission is distributed through the heliosphere why does the emission fall off concurrently with the end of the solar wind enhancement , and why ( again ) is the swcx emission light curve so constant ?      the episode of swcx emission reported here lasted for at least 38  ks ( @xmath67 hours ) which would have extended over seven _ rosat _ orbits .",
    "this is sufficiently long enough to be classified as a lte in the rass processing .",
    "however , this swcx episode has considerably more @xmath68  kev  flux than ltes observed during the rass .",
    "the fluxes listed in table  [ tbl : flux ] would have produced a _",
    "_ pspc count rate of @xmath69  counts  arcmin@xmath70  s@xmath21 in the r45 ( @xmath68  kev ) band , only slightly less than twice the typical intensity of the cosmic background at high galactic latitudes .",
    "most ltes were dominated by emission in the r12 ( @xmath6  kev ) band and the brightest @xmath68  kev band lte enhancements were only roughly half of the intensity of this detection .",
    "the data from the _ xmm - newton _ observation of the _ hubble _ deep field north show clear evidence for a time - variable component of the x - ray background that is most reasonably attributed to charge exchange emission between the highly ionized solar wind and exospheric or interplanetary neutrals .",
    "the swcx emission is dominated by the lines from c  vi , o  vii , o  viii , ne  ix , and mg  xi , and possibly lines from highly ionized iron ( e.g. , fe  xvii ) . the emission is concurrent with the passage of a strong enhancement in the solar wind observed by the _ ace _ satellite , and which is also strongly enhanced in its o@xmath4/o@xmath5 ratio , and possibly other highly ionized species ( although preliminary results for the o@xmath43/o@xmath4 ratio indicate otherwise ) .",
    "however , the light curve of the x - ray enhancement is relatively constant while the flux of the solar wind enhancement varies considerably .",
    "the observation of swcx emission allows the monitoring of interactions between the solar wind and solar system and/or interstellar neutrals without the need for _ in situ _",
    "measurements , albeit with the uncertainty of just where along the line of sight the emission arises .",
    "however , in certain circumstances the distance ambiguity can be resolved allowing the detailed study of the related phenomena .",
    "two such situations are mentioned above : the case of swcx emission from comets and exospheric material in the _ chandra _ dark moon observation .",
    "the ability to remotely sense the solar wind and its interactions can also be used when the emission is expected to have a predictable variation , such as an x - ray scan across the magnetopause sub - solar point @xcite . also ,",
    "for example , _ rosat _ data from the all - sky survey suggest that the downstream helium focusing cone can be imaged in x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the charge exchange line emission can provide a significant contaminating background to observations of more distant objects ( by any x - ray observatory with sensitivity at energies less than 1.5  kev ) which use those lines for diagnostics .",
    "however , the correlation of the x - ray enhancement with the solar wind density enhancement suggests a diagnostic .",
    "for those observations at risk because of such contamination , e.g. , observations of sources which cover the entire field of view and have thermal spectra , the data from solar wind monitoring observatories such as _ ace _ , _ wind _ , and _ soho _ should be used for screening .",
    "should the swcx emission be primarily exospheric in origin ( e.g. , from the magnetosheath ) , then the specific geometry of the observation should be examined as well .",
    "an observation where the observatory is outside of the magnetosheath and looking away from earth would clearly have significantly less exospheric swcx emission than the case of the emission reported in this paper where the observation line of sight may be passing tangentially through the magnetopause near the sub - solar point .    while swcx emission is likely responsible for the ltes observed during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , the swcx episode presented here was significantly brighter at @xmath68  kev  than what was typically observed ( a factor of two brighter than the most intense @xmath68  kev  rass lte ) .",
    "however , one important issue to note is that none of the x - ray emission lines discussed here ( or discussed in @xcite ) contribute significantly to the @xmath6  kev  band , where most of the lte emission was observed . also of note",
    "is that the geometry of this observation relative to earth s geomagnetic environment is considerably different from that of the rass . in this case",
    "we may be looking tangentially through the magnetosheath near the sub - solar point while _ rosat _ with its low circular orbit effectively looked radially outward through the flanks of the magnetosheath .",
