    "non - abelian moduli fields are widely discussed in the literature , in particular , in the context of non - abelian strings  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a number of theories allows strings with non - abelian moduli both in supersymmetric and in non - supersymmetric models .",
    "recently several simple models were suggested that allow the existence of topological defects ( abrikosov - nielsen - olesen string or domain walls ) which produce non - abelian degrees of freedom on their world sheets  @xcite .",
    "we consider a model with a global non - abelian symmetry @xmath0 which allows topological defects ( strings , vertices , domain walls ) to exist .",
    "these defects break the global symmetry @xmath0 to a subgroup @xmath1 ( also global ) .",
    "then , in addition to translational modes , there will be @xmath2 orientational modes .",
    "these moduli fields are governed by a sigma - model with @xmath3 internal space . as an example , see the recent publication  @xcite that introduced a simple model supporting domain walls .",
    "a domain wall breaks the global symmetry , and , as a result , there appear two orientational moduli in addition to a translational modulus . besides that , in  @xcite a spin - orbit interaction in the bulk was added that entangles the translational and orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "most of the main results of  @xcite have been obtained numerically .",
    "we , in turn , investigate the same model mostly analytically .",
    "we obtained an exact static solution that can be seen as a domain wall with an attached lump of the @xmath4 field and examined some of its properties .",
    "we also study the small excitation spectrum of the bare domain wall , with the field @xmath5 , and confirm that this domain wall is unstable when the model parameters are chosen as in  @xcite .",
    "we work with a real scalar field @xmath6 and a real triplet of scalars @xmath7 in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time .",
    "the space and time coordinates are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the dynamics of the system is governed by the lagrangian @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are positive constants , and @xmath15 runs from 1 to 3 .",
    "the fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 interact due to the term @xmath16 in the lagrangian .",
    "we further consider static domain - wall - like configurations .",
    "if the wall is orthogonal to the @xmath17 axis , the fields depend only on @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the equations of motion for the fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 that follow from the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) become @xmath21 here the prime stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath17 . since the considered model ( and , in particular , the system ( [ eq : eqmo1 ] ) ) allows arbitrary orientation of the field @xmath7 in the internal space ,",
    "we choose @xmath22 then the system ( [ eq : eqmo1 ] ) takes the form : @xmath23 to guess the form of the analytic solution , one has to look at the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) . if @xmath24 then the fields do not interact , and the free field @xmath19 is described by the lagrangian of the @xmath25 model , with one of the static solutions of the equation of motion being the well - known @xmath26 kink  @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "now , we assume that when we turn on the interaction between the fields in ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , @xmath19 holds its general form ( [ eq : kink ] ) with the possible scale dilation  @xcite : @xmath29 when this ansatz is substituted into the first equation of the system ( [ eq : eqmo_main ] ) , we obtain for @xmath30 : @xmath31 here the constant @xmath32 is related to @xmath33 and the other model parameters by @xmath34 further substituting ( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : chi ] ) in the second equation of the system ( [ eq : eqmo_main ] ) and equating coefficients in front of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we obtain two more relations between the constants : @xmath37    equations  ( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : chi ] ) , along with the constraints on the model parameters , are the static solution of the system ( [ eq : eqmo_main ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss some features of this solution .    * from equation  ( [ eq : a ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath38 at @xmath39 , which corresponds to the `` bare '' kink ( [ eq : kink ] ) . besides that",
    ", the limit @xmath40 can be taken only simultaneously with @xmath41 . * the spatial scales of the fields @xmath6 and @xmath4 are the same , both of the order of @xmath42 . *",
    "the asymptotics of the fields at @xmath43 are @xmath44 notice that these expressions coincide with those obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotics of the fields at @xmath45 are @xmath46 * on the @xmath47 plane the solution ( [ eq : phi ] ) , ( [ eq : chi ] ) is a semi - ellipse with semi - axes @xmath48 and @xmath32 ( we assume that @xmath49 ) . the ellipse becomes a line segment at @xmath39 . * the energy of the solution ( [ eq : phi ] ) , ( [ eq : chi ] ) or , more strictly , the tension of the corresponding plane structure in the three - dimensional space @xmath8 , is given by @xmath50\\right\\}dz,\\ ] ] and is equal to @xmath51 + when @xmath38 ( and @xmath52 ) , this gives just the energy of the kink ( [ eq : kink ] ) : + @xmath53 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath55 , @xmath5 satisfies the equations of motion following from the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) .",
    "now we will investigate the linear stability of this configuration . to do this , we insert @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , in the equations of motion , and get a time - independent schrdinger - like spectral problem with the spectral parameter @xmath58 : @xmath59\\eta=\\omega^2\\eta,\\ ] ] here @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath62 are : @xmath63 the discrete part of the spectrum is defined by @xmath64 , with @xmath65 starting from @xmath66 . in particular , with the choice of the model parameters as in  @xcite , we obtain : @xmath67 i.e.  there are three levels in the discrete part of the spectrum : @xmath68 the presence of the negative value @xmath69 means @xmath70 , i.e.  the configuration @xmath55 , @xmath5 is unstable .",
    "notice that our value of @xmath71 differs from that reported in  @xcite .",
    "we have considered a model with a real scalar field and a coupled scalar triplet with the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) .",
    "we found an exact analytic solution in the form of a domain wall with the coupled scalar triplet localized on the wall .",
    "we discussed some properties of this solution and also analysed the linear stability of the bare domain wall , and analytically showed that this bare domain wall solution is unstable .",
