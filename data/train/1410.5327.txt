    "capacitively coupled radio frequency ( ccrf ) discharges operated at low pressures are highly relevant for industrial applications such as plasma etching and sputtering@xcite . for these purposes",
    "low neutral gas pressures of a few pascal are typically used to ensure a perpendicular energetic ion bombardment of the wafer .",
    "commercial reactors are designed to optimize process rates via providing a high plasma density and ion flux . in this context , the effects of changing the driving frequency , @xmath1 , and the electrode gap , @xmath2 , on the plasma density in this low pressure non - local and collisionless regime are highly relevant for fundamental insights into the physics of ccrf discharges and applications , e.g. , for improved reactor designs . changing these two global control parameters",
    "affects the electron heating dynamics and the plasma density . at such low pressure conditions the electron heating",
    "is typically dominated by stochastic @xcite and ambipolar heating @xcite during the phases of sheath expansion at both electrodes in electropositive discharges .",
    "this heating mode is typically called the @xmath0-mode @xcite . in case of high ion fluxes and limited electron mobilities",
    "electric field reversals during sheath collapse can also cause significant electron heating @xcite . changing global control parameters such as the neutral gas pressure , the frequency , or the gas mixture can induce transitions into different heating modes .",
    "these can occur as the @xmath3-mode at high pressures , low driving frequencies and/or high driving voltage amplitudes@xcite or the drift - ambipolar heating mode at high pressures and/or in electronegative plasmas@xcite .",
    "in this work we investigate a regime , where stochastic electron heating dominates . extensive research on this topic has been performed in the past : by experiments and models , lieberman and godyak have shown that electrons are heated collisionlessly on time average by repeated interactions with the electric field of the time modulated plasma sheaths @xcite .",
    "based on a global power balance , the plasma density is assumed to increase proportionally to @xmath4 at fixed pressure and electrode gap@xcite .",
    "such models include the energy loss per electron lost at the electrodes , @xmath5 , as one loss term and assume it to be dominated by thermal electrons . under the assumption of a maxwellian electron energy distribution function ( eedf )",
    "@xmath6 is assumed , where @xmath7 is the electron temperature . under the low pressure conditions investigated here",
    "the eedf is non - maxwellian and the mean electron energy is strongly space dependent and changes on a nanosecond timescale due to the presence of non - local kinetic effects so that the definition of a global electron temperature becomes meaningless ( correspondingly , the terms heating and cooling are used with respect to the total kinetic energy of the electrons , not the electron temperature ) .",
    "in fact , beams of highly energetic electrons are generated at each electrode during sheath expansion and propagate almost collisionlessly through the bulk until they hit the opposing sheath , since @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is the electron mean free path .",
    "such kinetic effects are neglected in previous models , but are found to play a critical role when the gas pressure is low .    the impingement phase of these highly energetic electrons at the opposing sheath is found to be of great relevance .",
    "if an energetic beam electron hits the opposing sheath at a phase of high local sheath potential , it will be reflected back into the bulk and can still ionize the neutral gas , i.e. its confinement is effective .",
    "while interacting with the moving sheath , it can be cooled ( collapsing sheath ) or heated ( expanding sheath ) .",
    "if an energetic electron bounces back and forth between both sheaths and hits each sheath during its expansion phase , it will be heated multiple times .",
    "this effect is called electron bounce resonance heating ( brh ) and was recently investigated by liu et al .",
    "@xcite based on earlier work of wood@xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that an electron beam with a certain velocity will be heated coherently between both sheath expansions , if the time to traverse the bulk , @xmath10 , is half the rf period .",
    "it was also confirmed that electron brh is affected by the electrode gap distance , the pressure and the driving frequency and affects the plasma density .",
    "if beam electrons hit the opposing sheath during sheath collapse , i.e. , at a phase of low local sheath voltage , they will reach the electrode and will be lost from the plasma , i.e. , their confinement is not effective .    in this work ,",
    "we study the effect of changing the driving frequency on the plasma density and the electron heating dynamics by particle - in - cell / monte - carlo collision ( pic / mcc ) simulations and an analytical power balance model , at low pressures in argon gas .",
    "in contrast to previous models , we find that the plasma density is not proportional to @xmath4 in this collisionless regime , where @xmath11 . instead , a complex behavior of the plasma density as a function of the applied radio - frequency is observed including a steep step - like increase at a distinct driving frequency .",
    "based on the power balance model we demonstrate that this step - like increase is caused by a modulation of the confinement quality of energetic beam electrons as a function of the driving frequency .",
    "an abrupt decrease of the plasma density is observed , when a high number of energetic beam electrons hits the opposing collapsed sheath and is lost at the electrodes .",
    "this causes the energy loss per electron lost at the electrodes , @xmath12 , to increase drastically and the plasma density to decrease strongly .",
    "the number of energetic electron beams generated at a given electrode during one phase of sheath expansion and the impingement phase of beam electrons at the opposing electrode are found to change as a function of the driving frequency , since an electron heating mode transition is induced by changing the frequency . at high driving frequencies and high plasma densities",
    "the sheaths are small and expand relatively slowly , while the sheaths are found to expand more rapidly at lower driving frequencies and low plasma densities under the conditions investigated here . below a distinct driving frequency the sheaths",
    "expand so fast that the electrons can not react and oscillations of the electron heating rate at frequencies comparable to the local electron plasma frequency are excited similarly to previous findings of vender et al .",
    "@xcite . based on ku et al .",
    "@xcite these oscillations might be considered to be consequences of the local excitation of a plasma parallel resonance ( ppr ) .",
    "this effect induces a transition into a resonant heating mode . in this low density resonant mode",
    "two electron beams are generated at each electrode during one phase of sheath expansion .",
    "the later beam hits the opposing electrode during sheath collapse and causes the observed increase of @xmath12 and , thus , the decrease of the density .",
    "this mechanism is self - amplifying and keeps the discharge in the low density resonant heating mode .",
    "such kinetic confinement effects are not included in previous models , however , they have a dramatic effect on the plasma density .",
    "we investigate the effects of changing the electrode gap , the neutral gas pressure , and the electron reflection as well as the ion induced secondary electron emission coefficients at both electrodes on the plasma density at different driving frequencies .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : in section 2 the pic / mcc simulation and the choice of input parameters is introduced briefly .",
    "the analytical power balance model is described in section 3 .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "pic / mcc simulations provide the basis for studying the kinetic behavior of electron beams in ccrf plasmas based on a self - consistent and accurate description of the particle dynamics .",
    "in low temperature plasmas kinetic and non - local effects are of great relevance .",
    "the trajectories of fast electrons and their interaction with the plasma sheaths , as well as the kinetic energy loss due to electrons lost at the walls can be obtained from these simulations . in this work",
    "we use a 1d3v electrostatic particle - in - cell code , which has been benchmarked against other codes developed by different authors@xcite .",
    "the code includes three types of electron - neutral ( elastic , excitation and ionization ) and two types of ion - neutral collisions ( isotropic and backward elastic scattering ) for an argon plasma .",
    "the required cross sections are taken from the jila database@xcite .",
    "all particle interactions are treated by the monte - carlo method with a null - collision scheme @xcite .",
    "the electrodes are assumed to be infinite , planar and parallel .",
    "one of the electrodes is driven by the following voltage waveform :    @xmath13    while the other electrode is grounded .",
    "the electrode gap , @xmath2 , is varied ( 14 mm @xmath14 20 mm ) and the neutral gas pressure is between 1 pa and 5 pa .",
    "the driving frequency , @xmath1 , is scanned from 40 mhz to 90 mhz , while the applied voltage amplitude is kept constant at @xmath15 v. we define a base case with the following parameters : 1.3 pa , 1.5 cm electrode gap , and 150 v voltage amplitude ; the electron and ion sticking coefficients are set to 1 ( no reflection ) and the secondary electron emission from the electrodes is neglected due to the low pressure scenario investigated . by initially switching off these surface reactions in the simulation a clearer analysis of",
    "the underlying physics is possible due to the absence of surface induced effects .",
    "after understanding the fundamental particle dynamics of this base case , the electron sticking coefficient , @xmath16 , and the ion induced secondary electron emission coefficient , @xmath3 , are varied and their effects on the plasma density at different driving frequencies are studied .",
    "@xmath16 is varied from @xmath17 to @xmath18 and @xmath3 is varied from @xmath19 to @xmath18 , to cover the range of surface coefficients typically used in simulations of ccrf plasmas @xcite and also relevant to other physical systems .",
    "identical electrode materials are assumed , i.e. the electrode surface coefficients are kept identical at both electrodes .",
    "the spatial grid used in the simulations is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of numerical grid cells .",
    "we set @xmath22 2000 - 4000 timesteps per rf period and the time step is @xmath23 . as we vary the driving frequency and the gap size , the space and time step , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are not fixed , but fulfill the following stability and accuracy conditions , while minimizing the required computational time : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the debye length and @xmath28 is the electron plasma frequency .",
    "we use an adaptive particle weighting in order to obtain more than 100000 super - particles ( for electrons ) when convergence is achieved .",
    "we use a power balance for the electrons to calculate the ion density at the electrodes , @xmath29 , as a function of the driving frequency , while keeping the driving voltage amplitude , the pressure , and the electrode gap constant@xcite :    @xmath30    here , @xmath31 is the total power absorbed by the electrons per area which is calculated by the space and time average product @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the electric field and @xmath34 is the electron current density .",
    "@xmath35 is the elementary charge , @xmath36 is the ion velocity at the electrodes , @xmath37 is the collisional electron energy loss per electron - ion pair created , and @xmath5 is the average energy per electron lost at the electrodes .",
    "this model assumes equal electron and ion fluxes to each electrode on time average .",
    "this condition is necessarily fulfilled in ccrf plasmas driven via a blocking capacitor @xcite .",
    "solving this equation for @xmath29 allows to calculate the ion density at the electrodes :    @xmath38    where @xmath31 , @xmath36 , @xmath5 and @xmath37 are taken as input parameters from the pic / mcc simulation .    reproducing the plasma density as a function of the driving frequency obtained by the simulation via this model allows to understand the physical origin of the sudden increase in density at distinct frequencies observed in the simulation",
    "this is carried out by analyzing the absorbed power per area , the ion velocity at the electrodes , the energy per electron lost at the electrodes , and the collisional energy loss per electron - ion pair created separately as a function of the driving frequency .",
    "the model then allows to determine the effect of each of these parameters on the ion density at the electrodes .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the left plot of figure [ reflection ] shows the averaged plasma density as a function of the driving frequency for different electron sticking coefficients at the electrodes . typically a sticking coefficient of 0.8 is used in simulations of ccrf plasmas @xcite . reducing the sticking coefficient leads to a smoother density increase , because more beam electrons are reflected after hitting the electrode during sheath collapse .",
    "the step - like increase of the density is observed at lower frequencies in case of a lower sticking coefficient , since more reflected electrons lead to a higher density at a given frequency .",
    "this results in a slower sheath expansion at a given frequency and leads to the heating mode transition causing the density jump to occur at lower driving frequencies , where the plasma density is lower .",
    "the deviations from a quadratic dependence of the plasma density on the driving frequency remain substantial even for very low sticking coefficients .",
    "the electron sticking coefficient depends on the electrode material and is unknown for many materials under plasma conditions . comparing measured plasma densities as a function of the driving frequency to those obtained from the simulation under variation of @xmath16 might allow to determine the sticking coefficient for a given electrode material .",
    "the right plot of figure [ reflection ] shows the averaged plasma density as a function of the driving frequency for different @xmath3-coefficients . changing the secondary electron emission coefficient has only a weak effect on the plasma density under these low pressure collisionless conditions , since @xmath3-electrons are not multiplied efficiently by collisions inside the sheaths .",
    "increasing @xmath3 leads to a weak increase of the plasma density and shifts the heating mode transition and , thus , the density jump towards lower driving frequencies for the same reasons as discussed for the variation of the electron sticking coefficient .",
    "in contrast to previous assumptions , the dependence of the plasma density on the driving frequency in low pressure single frequency capacitively coupled argon plasmas is not found to be quadratic . instead , a strong step - like increase of the density at distinct driving frequencies is observed in kinetic pic / mcc simulations . based on an electron power balance model and a detailed analysis of the electron dynamics observed in the simulation , this increase is found to be related to a modulated confinement quality of energetic electron beams generated at each electrode during the phase of sheath expansion as a function of the driving frequency .",
    "this modulation results in a drastic change of the energy lost per electron lost at the electrodes and causes the observed density jump .",
    "it is related to an electron heating mode transition from the classical @xmath0-mode at high driving frequencies and plasma densities into a low density resonant mode at lower driving frequencies .",
    "this mode transition is induced by a faster sheath expansion at lower frequencies and plasma densities on the timescale of the inverse local electron plasma frequency . similarly to earlier results of vender et al.@xcite and ku et al.@xcite this causes high frequency oscillations of the electron heating rate .",
    "consequently , the generation of two electron beams at each electrode per sheath expansion phase is observed in the simulations in contrast to one beam in the classical @xmath0-mode observed at higher driving frequencies . at the low pressures investigated here these beams propagate through the plasma bulk almost without collisions and interact with the opposing rf boundary sheath . in the low density mode ,",
    "the second beam generated at each electrode per rf period hits the opposing sheath during sheath collapse resulting in a poor confinement of those beam electrons and an increase of the energy lost by electrons lost at the electrodes in contrast to the high density mode , where a good confinement quality is observed .",
    "due to the low plasma density the maximum sheath widths are large and the plasma bulk is small in the resonant heating mode .",
    "thus , beam electrons launched at the sheath edge at one electrode can not dissipate much energy via collisions while propagating through the bulk and are cooled immediately at the opposing collapsing sheath .",
    "this results in a sudden decrease of the electron heating on time average in the low density mode and causes a stronger change of the plasma density . due to their large widths",
    "the sheaths are more collisional in the low density regime and the ion velocity at the electrode decreases compared to the high density mode at higher driving frequencies .    at very high driving frequencies",
    "the confinement quality of energetic beam electrons is improved by shortening the duration of the sheath collapse at each electrode .",
    "beam electrons entering the collapsing sheath are reflected and leave the sheath during sheath expansion effectively , resulting in less efficient electron cooling during sheath collapse and more electron heating on time average . consequently , more energetic electrons are observed at high driving frequencies and the average energy of electrons absorbed at the electrodes during the short phase of sheath collapse is high .    increasing the neutral gas pressure is found to attenuate the density jump and to shift it towards lower driving frequencies due to collisional scattering of the beam electrons on their way to the opposing electrode and higher plasma densities .",
    "the latter effect causes the sheaths to expand more slowly at a given frequency and causes the heating mode transition to occur at lower driving frequencies , where the plasma density is lower and the sheaths expand faster . for similar reasons decreasing the electrode gap shifts the density jump towards higher frequencies and increases its height",
    ".    decreasing the electron sticking coefficient results in a smoother density jump , since the modulation of the confinement quality of the energetic beam electrons is attenuated . comparing density measurements as a function of the driving frequency with simulation results under variation of the sticking coefficient , therefore , potentially allows to determine the sticking coefficient for a given electrode material .    changing the @xmath3-coefficient has only a weak effect on the plasma density under the low pressure conditions investigated , since",
    "secondary electrons are not multiplied efficiently by collisions inside the sheaths . besides the weak increase of the plasma density as a function of @xmath3 a shift of the density jump towards lower driving frequencies is found , since the heating mode transition occurs at lower driving frequencies .",
    "the observed step - like increase of the plasma density is expected to be highly relevant for the reactor design of low pressure ccrf plasmas used for plasma etching and rf sputtering , where engineers typically intend to maximize the plasma density and ion flux to optimize process rates , while keeping the driving frequencies low .",
