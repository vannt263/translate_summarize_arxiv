    "they have been successfully used to detect the large scale structure and nicely match the structures detected by x  ray and spectroscopic surveys . although limited by the photo  z precision ( which implies a smoothing effect ) , the photometric redshifts trace the dependence of galaxy properties on environment in the lss and can use large unbiased galaxy samples , a factor of @xmath84 larger samples than the largest spectroscopic surveys thus limiting the statistical scatter ( scoville et al .",

    "scoville et al . (",
    "2007b ) showed that the correlations between galaxy properties , such as sfr , stellar mass , and environment are not smoothed out when using accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "conversely , spectroscopic surveys allow for precise distance measurements but are limited by the sampling rate which is usually low .",
    "the projected density around each galaxy is derived from the distance to the nth neighbor , _ r _ , which defines a circular area whose surface density is @xmath85 .",
    "this density is then divided by the median of projected densities of each redshift slice across the whole cosmos field , in order to obtain a relative density @xmath86 in each redshift interval .",
    "we compute projected densities for each galaxy with magnitude @xmath1 and stellar mass larger than 10@xmath87m@xmath10 , outside masked areas contaminated by saturated stars ( ilbert et al .",
    "2009a ) , using 50390 galaxies in total .",
    "we use a cylinder with a depth of @xmath88 centered on each galaxy .",
    "the main difference with previous studies on the cosmos field is that the accuracy of the photometric redshifts has now improved by roughly a factor of 3 .",
    "the density field of the cosmos data is measured using the same selection described above . at these stellar masses",

    "as discussed also in scoville et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , a higher stellar mass cut  off would be more conservative and yield larger completeness , but at the same time would limit the sample to only the most massive galaxies and under  represent lower mass galaxies , therefore limiting the dynamic range .",
    "therefore when computing densities we allow for a lower completeness .",
    "conversely , when comparing lirgs to optical galaxies we adopt a cut at @xmath90m@xmath10 in order to have a higher completeness level ( see sect .",
    "we used the millennium simulation mock catalogs ( kitzbichler & white 2007 ) to compare the derived surface densities with the three dimensional ( 3d ) volume densities for galaxies selected in the same way as for the cosmos data .",
    "we run the simulation here described using the same selection used for the observed data .",
    "first , we compute the 3d volume densities by using the positional information available from the millennium simulation , and measure the density field around each galaxy in a sphere of radius equal to the distance of the 10th nearest neighbor . in the simplest assumption ,",
    "i.e. spherical symmetry , the 3d densities are related to the projected densities by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the distance to the 10th nearest neighbor .",
    "no redshift errors were included in the 3d density computation at this stage .",
    "this density is related to the projected density by the following relation : @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ app ] shows the correlation between the input and recovered densities .",

    "the vertical axis shows the @xmath95 measured in the millennium simulation in the same way as for the cosmos data as described at the beginning of this section .",
    "this test indicates that projected densities on average overestimate the real densities by a factor of 2.2 but there is proportionality between the 2d and the 3d density estimates for the simulated data ( figure 4 , black contours ) . in order to estimate how the photo - z errors affect the 2d density computation we associate to each redshift in the mock catalog a random error drawn from a gaussian distribution with @xmath96 , equal to the error in the measured photometric redshift of cosmos , and we measure the projected densities",
    "a gaussian error distribution is an approximation of the real error distribution .",
    "however , it is reasonable , considering that catastrophic errors in the photo  z are not an issue both for the optically selected and the 24  selected samples down to @xmath64 , since they are of the order 1% and will therefore only affect densities by that amount ( ilbert et al .",
    "the effect of the photometric redshift error is shown in figure [ app ] with red contours .",
    "the errors in the photo  z increase the scatter in the correlation between 3d and projected densities .",
    "however projected densities are still proportional to 3d densities and environment can be characterized at least in the high density regime .",
    "the scatter of the correlation is large at small densities but it decreases with increasing density .",
    "this can affect and smooth out possible existing trends by scattering galaxies between contiguous density bins . at @xmath97",
    "the scatter is about 100% of the density value , meaning that a galaxy residing in a region of density 10@xmath98mpc@xmath29 will be assigned to a density range @xmath99mpc@xmath29 with a probability of 68.3% . at @xmath100100",
    "the scatter is about 25% of the density value .",

    "the scatter is @xmath102% .",
    "this must be taken into account when studying trends as a function of the environment , and the density bins must be chosen accordingly .",
    "in particular , for the four density bins used in this paper ( see section 5 ) , the 1@xmath22 error on the density estimate is 150% , 68% , 42% and 32% of the projected density value , for each bin from the low density to the high density one , respectively .     versus projected 3d galaxy density , from the millennium simulation ( black contours ) .",

    "we notice that possible existing trends are likely to be erased in the low density regime ( first two bins in projected densities ) , but the flat trend observed here is significant in the two highest density bins .",

    "( 2008 ) are not mass  limited and spanned a broader range both in stellar mass and sfr , probing down to significantly lower sfr compared to our lirg sample",

    "such rise is predicted by the evolution of the lirg luminosity function(le floch et al .",
    "2005 , caputi et al .",
    "2007 , magnelli et al . 2009 ) and of the mass function by spectral type ( ilbert et al . 2009b ) .",
    "_ ii _ ) we find that the lirg fraction decreases in the high density environments . at densities larger than about @xmath107 mpc@xmath108 the lirg fraction drops compared to the low density environment .",
    "the decrease of the lirg fraction with increasing density is observed up to @xmath13 , but the dependence flattens with increasing redshift .",
    "the difference between the 3rd and the 4th density bin decreases from the low redshift sample ( 2.0@xmath1090.2 factor at @xmath110 ) to the high redshift ones ( 1.6@xmath1090.16 and 1.3@xmath1090.1 factors at @xmath111 and 0.9 , respectively ) , for stellar masses m@xmath105m@xmath10 .",
    "the first two density bins should not be considered since in this range the uncertainties in the density measurement probably erase possible existing trends .",
    "figure [ frlirglowz ] , right panel , the lirg fraction is shown for galaxies with stellar masses larger than m@xmath112m@xmath10 .",
    "again , the lirg fraction decreases towards high densities , and the decrease appears to flatten with increasing redshift .",
    "the ratio between the third and fourth density bin is 2.15@xmath1090.2 at @xmath110 and it decreases to @xmath113 and @xmath114 at @xmath111 and 0.9 , respectively . at @xmath104",
    "the lirg fraction is constant at all densities within the errors for both stellar mass bins .",
    "we note that the dependence is observed also for the lirg sample cleaned from contribution by the agn detected by xmm",
    " newton survey .",
    "indeed , the two samples , with and without agn , follow the same trend within the errors ( figure [ frlirglowz ] ) . the environmental properties of agn in the large  scale structure and the comparison with star  forming galaxies are beyond the aim of this paper , and they will be addressed in a separate work .    the decreasing fraction observed here is not due to projection effects since : a ) the size of the two highest density bins is larger than the average scatter of the relation shown in figure 4 ; b ) the errors on projected densities tend to smooth out trends by scattering galaxies between contiguous bins .",
    "we explore the possibility that the decreasing fraction of lirg in the high density environment might be produced by mass segregation , i.e. the most massive galaxies are formed in the most massive halos at earlier times , and therefore , preferentially reside in high density environments . as mentioned before , we studied the environmental dependence in two stellar mass bins in order to minimize such effect . in figure [ frmass ]",
    "we plot the normalized distributions of stellar masses of lirgs and of the optical sample in redshift bins and in two regimes , high and low projected density ( @xmath115 and @xmath116mpc@xmath117 respectively ) .",
    "the red histograms show the lirg fraction , with poisson errors taken into account .",
    "such fraction is plotted in 0.5 dex wide bins of stellar mass in order to minimize the noise .",
    "the mass distribution of lirgs is not skewed towards lower masses compared to optically  selected galaxies .",
    "the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( ks ) test shows that the distributions of lirgs and optical galaxies derive from the same parent population with a probability larger than @xmath118 for all the bins except the last three ( @xmath72 and @xmath119 , high density ) , for which the ks test gives no significant result .",
    "however , the lirg fraction does not show any significant trend as a function of stellar mass in any environment in the stellar mass range studied here .",
    "therefore the decreasing fraction of lirgs in high densities ( figure [ frlirglowz ] ) is not a mass related effect but it is due to the environment .",
    "figure  [ frmipsz ] shows the fraction of lirgs as a function of redshift , normalized to their values in our first redshift bin ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "empty triangles represent the whole sample , regardless of the environment .",
    "the lirg fraction increases with redshift , reflecting the evolution of the whole infrared selected population .",
    "this increase is similar to the global increase observed in figure  [ frlirglowz ] . we compare it with the expectations from the known evolution of the galaxy population",
    ": we use the mass functions of ilbert et al .",

    "we expect that most lirgs lie above our mass threshold , but not all of them , given the scatter of the relation . therefore we can compute from the luminosity and mass functions ( lf and mf ) an upper limit to our observed relation . the solid curve in figure  [ frmipsz ]",
    "shows the expected upper limit variation for the lirg fraction .",
    "we find a similar behavior , with the lirg fraction increasing with redshift , but at a lower rate than what the lf and mf would predict : between @xmath120 and @xmath4 , we observe a 3 fold increase in the lirg fraction , while the computed increase is 4 fold .",
    "this discrepancy is expected since the solid line is an upper limit .",
    "we plot with open circles the evolution of the lirg fraction in low density environment ( @xmath124 mpc@xmath108 ) , and with solid circles that for high density environment ( @xmath125 mpc@xmath108 ) .",
    "we find that the lirg fraction evolves faster ( a factor of 2 ) in high density environments than in low density ones , at 2@xmath22 confidence level .",

    "we studied the properties of our infrared galaxy sample in two bins of stellar mass .",
    "the environment was characterized by using the distance of the 10th nearest neighbor , and the derived projected galaxy density around each galaxy in redshift slices .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * the median sfr and ssfr per lirg increase with redshift , in agreement with the expected evolution of the lirg luminosity and mass functions ( le floch et al .",

    "the median sfr and median ssfr are constant at all densities within the errors , in agreement with what found by hwang et al .",

    "* we find that the fraction of massive lirgs among optically selected galaxies with the same stellar mass , varies as a function of both redshift and environment .",
    "the global lirg fraction increases with increasing redshift , as expected from the cosmic evolution of the sfr density and of the infrared lf .",
    "the lirg fraction decreases with increasing environment density .",
    "such decrease flattens going from @xmath52 to @xmath3 and the fraction is constant in all environments for @xmath104 .",
    "these results imply that the evolution of the lirg fraction among optically selected galaxies from @xmath4 to @xmath52 is roughly twice as fast in dense than in low density environments . * finally , we find that a large fraction of lirgs is present in the most dense environments by @xmath3",
    ". these might be the progenitors of the massive galaxies found today in the center of clusters , which therefore were not likely formed through dry mergers .",
    "using photometric redshift , with their inherent limitations , we have shown that lss and environment has a role on star formation .",
