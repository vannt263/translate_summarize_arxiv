    "the lack of works on @xmath0 reveals the overlook of the importance of this meson .",
    "first of all , the hadroproduction rate of @xmath0 is a good test of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite , since , for one thing , the prediction based on color - singlet model ( csm ) is far below the nrqcd result ; one is easy to favor one over the other by comparing them to experimental measurement . and",
    "for another thing , the cross sections depend on only one nonperturbative parameter , which is not like the case of @xmath10 , where the difficulty of the precise determination of the three co ldmes causes ambiguity  @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the branching ratio @xmath11 is as large as @xmath12  @xcite , precise prediction of prompt @xmath13 production rate requires the evaluation of @xmath0 production rate .",
    "one should notice that , @xmath13 inelastic production in @xmath14 collisions is another one of the best processes for testing nrqcd other than the @xmath10 hadroproduction  @xcite .",
    "finally , nrqcd scaling rule requires the co ldme for @xmath0 should be of the same magnitude as that for @xmath15 .",
    "this rule does not only provide an opportunity to investigate @xmath0 in nrqcd framework despite the lack of experimental measurement , but also provides an opportunity to test the corresponding velocity scaling rule .    since next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections noticeably change the behavior of the transverse momentum ( @xmath16 ) distribution of the production rate of p - wave quarkonia through color - singlet ( cs ) channel  @xcite .",

    "@xcite .",
    "another thing we want to address before the discussions is that , csm can not provide nlo corrections to @xmath2 hadroproduction , since the infrared ( ir ) divergence does not cancel . in nrqcd framework , this part of the ir divergence is canceled by including the nlo corrections to the co ldme . to renormalize the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergence coming from the correction to the ldme , one should introduce a new scale , which here is called the nrqcd scale ( denoted as @xmath20 ) . before our work",

    "therefore , we employ the values of the co ldme obtained at different @xmath20 choices to see how much the results depend on this scale .",
    "as is know , an all - order ( in @xmath1 ) calculation will eliminate all the free scales from the expression of a physical quantity .",
