    "its existence has been confirmed by the cdf and d0 collaborations  @xcite through its inclusive production in proton - antiproton collisions .",
    "the discovery mode @xmath15 has also been confirmed by the babar collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 mass , combining all measurements in this final state , is  @xcite @xmath16 which is at the threshold for the production of the charmed meson pair @xmath17 .",
    "recent studies from belle and cdf that combine angular information , and kinematic properties of the @xmath18 pair , strongly favor a @xmath19 or @xmath20 assignment  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 does not appear to be a simple quark model @xmath21 meson state : different models have been proposed to explain the nature of the @xmath0 including s - wave @xmath22 molecule models  @xcite and various diquark - antidiquark models  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 molecule proposal is motivated by the proximity of the @xmath0 to the @xmath17 threshold : @xmath24  mev  @xcite .    in the molecular model ,",
    "the @xmath0 is a @xmath25 state .",
    "some authors have argued  @xcite that this model , together with factorization , heavy - quark and isospin symmetries , implies that the ratio of @xmath26 to @xmath1 decays is smaller than 0.1 ; this claim has recently been challenged  @xcite .",
    "this ratio is expected to be unity for charmonium as well as for hybrids ( @xmath27 ) and glueballs ( @xmath28 ) .",

    ", the @xmath0 produced in charged @xmath14 meson decays will have a mass that is different from its counterpart in neutral @xmath14 meson decays by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a mixing angle that is near @xmath31 .    in order to test the predictions of these models , we compare branching fraction and @xmath0 mass measurements in charged and neutral @xmath14 decays . a previous study performed by babar  @xcite using 413",
    "fb@xmath12 was not conclusive on these points ; this analysis uses a larger sample , 605  fb@xmath12 ( 657 @xmath32 pairs ) , collected with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath33 ( 3.5  gev on 8  gev ) collider  @xcite operating at the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath34 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) . the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two different inner detector configurations were used . for the first sample of 152 @xmath35 @xmath36 pairs , a 2.0 cm radius beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector (",
    "svd - i ) were used ; for the remaining @xmath37 @xmath36 pairs , a 1.5 cm radius beampipe , a 4-layer silicon detector ( svd - ii ) , and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used  @xcite .",
    "charged tracks are required to originate from the interaction point .",
    "a likelihood ratio @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the likelihood value for the pion ( kaon ) hypothesis , is built using acc , tof and cdc ( @xmath41 ) measurements . for charged kaons ,",
    "we impose @xmath42 that have an 88% efficiency and a 10% efficiency for pions .",
    "@xmath43 candidates are selected within the @xmath18 mass range [ 0.4840 , 0.5127 ] gev/@xmath8 .",
    "requirements on the @xmath43 vertex displacement from the interaction point and on the difference between vertex and @xmath43 flight directions are applied .",
    "this selection is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath44 mesons in the @xmath45 decay channel ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) and include bremsstrahlung photons that are within 50 mrad of either the @xmath48 or @xmath49 tracks ( denoted as @xmath50 ) .",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath44 candidates is required to be within @xmath51 gev/@xmath8 @xmath52 gev/@xmath8 and @xmath53 gev/@xmath54 gev/@xmath8 , where @xmath55 denotes the @xmath44 nominal mass  @xcite , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the reconstructed invariant masses from @xmath50 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath44 candidate is then combined with a @xmath59 pair for further analysis : both the @xmath0 and the @xmath60 , which is used for calibration , decay to this final state . more than one @xmath61 combination may be possible at this stage .",
    "an additional cut is applied on the @xmath62 variable : @xmath63 . for @xmath64 modes ( @xmath65 ) , we apply the above requirement with @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) . for the former case , this cut corresponds to @xmath68  mev/@xmath8 for the @xmath60 region and @xmath69  mev/@xmath8 for the @xmath0 region and reduces significantly the combinatorial background ( @xmath70 in the charged mode ) for a reasonable loss of efficiency ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "it also has the property of making the background flat in the @xmath72 variable .    to reduce the combinatorial background from @xmath73 continuum events , we require @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the ratio of the second to zeroth normalized fox - wolfram moments  @xcite , and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the polar angle of the @xmath14 meson momentum in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system , relative to the @xmath48 beam direction .",
    "@xmath14 candidates are obtained by combining a @xmath78 , a @xmath43 or @xmath79 candidate with the @xmath80 candidate .",
    "we select @xmath14 candidates using two variables : the energy difference @xmath81 , and the beam constrained mass @xmath82 , where the summation is over all particles from the @xmath14 candidate ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 are their cm three - momenta and masses respectively ) and @xmath85 is the @xmath14 candidate momentum in the cm frame . if more than one candidate is obtained at this stage of the analysis , the candidate with @xmath86 closest to zero is selected .",
    "only @xmath14 candidates with @xmath87 mev and @xmath88 gev/@xmath8 are considered for further analysis .",
    "from this point onwards , we correct the mass measurement using the known @xmath44 mass , redefining @xmath72 as @xmath89 .",
    "the selection cuts isolate a very pure sample of @xmath90 , @xmath91 decays .",
    "these events are used to calibrate the @xmath92 resolution and estimate the systematic uncertainty for the @xmath0 mass difference .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     for the @xmath93 mode , the pdf for the background is the sum of a function @xmath94 , representing phase space , and a breit - wigner function , to describe the @xmath95 contribution , obtained from @xmath92 sidebands ( @xmath96 gev ) .",
    "the pdfs for the signal are a breit - wigner pdf with a free mean and width to represent the @xmath95 component and a histogram pdf obtained from mc to represent the @xmath97 component .",
    "the signal yield obtained for the @xmath98 component is @xmath99 events and corresponds to @xmath100 .",
    "this result is in reasonable agreement with the pdg branching fraction  @xcite , @xmath101 .    for the @xmath102 mode ,",

    "the background yield is fixed from these sidebands .",
    "the signal is represented by two components : a @xmath95 breit - wigner pdf and a phase space function obtained from mc .",
    "the signal yields are @xmath104 and @xmath105 events , respectively .",

    "a product branching fraction of @xmath106 is also obtained . for the systematic error contributions , in addition to those that enter for @xmath1 ( table  [ tab_br_syst ] ) ,",
    "we have one more track in the final state , limited statistics to fix the background in @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) , and possible peaking background contributions in @xmath92 , based on a study of the @xmath109 calibration mode , ( @xmath110% ) .",
    "the result for the @xmath0 case is in marked contrast to the @xmath60 case , where the non resonant @xmath111 component is small and the @xmath112 and @xmath113 branching fractions are of comparable size .",
    "@xmath114 dominance is also found for @xmath115 and @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "+ in summary , we report the first statistically significant observation of @xmath2 decay and measure the ratio of branching fractions to be @xmath4 , consistent with unity .",
    "the mass difference between the @xmath117 states produced in these two decay modes is found to be @xmath7 mev/@xmath8 , consistent with zero .",
