    "currently , about 2000 microlensing events are being detected each year from survey experiments ( ogle : udalski 2003 ; moa : bond et al .",
    "2001 ; sumi et al .",
    "2003 ) . among them",
    ", a considerable fraction are produced by objects composed of two masses .",
    "when a lensing event is produced by a binary object , the resulting light curve deviates from the smooth and symmetric form of a single - lens event @xcite .",
    "analyzing a binary - lens light curve is important because it enables to extract information about the lens . for general binary - lens events ,",
    "this information includes the binary mass ratio , @xmath4 , and the projected separation between the lens components normalized by the angular einstein radius @xmath5 of the lens , @xmath2 ( normalized projected separation ) . for events with resolved caustic crossings ,",
    "it is possible to measure or constrain the mass and distance to the lens . not being dependent on the lens luminosity",
    ", microlensing provides an important tool especially for the study of binaries composed of faint or dark objects .",
    "however , accurate analysis of a binary - lens light curve is often hampered by the ambiguity in fits of observed light curves .",
    "many cases of degenerate solutions are accidental , implying that the degeneracy can be resolved by precise and dense coverage of light curves .",
    "however , due to a symmetry in the lens equation itself , degeneracies between close @xmath0 and wide @xmath1 binaries can be very severe .",
    "this was first pointed out for a special case of low - mass ( planetary ) companions by @xcite .",
    "it was then generalized to all binaries by @xcite and analyzed still more thoroughly by @xcite .",
    "therefore , devising a method resolving the close / wide degeneracy is important to uniquely characterize binary lens systems .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a method that can resolve the close / wide degeneracy .",
    "the method is based on the fact that orbital motion tends to be important for close binary lenses while it is negligible for wide binary lenses .",
    "we demonstrate the usefulness of the method in the interpretation of an actually observed lensing event moa-2011-blg-040/ogle-2011-blg-0001 .",
    "the existence of an additional lens component can make lensing light curves greatly different from that of a single - lens event .",
    "the most dramatic feature of binary lensing is caustics , which represent positions on the source plane where the lensing magnification of a point source becomes infinite @xcite . as a result , binary - lens light curves resulting from caustic - crossing source trajectories exhibit characteristic spikes .",
    "binary lensing caustics form a single or multiple sets of closed curves each of which is composed of concave curves that meet at cusps . the caustic topology is broadly classified into three categories depending on the binary separation @xcite . for a resonant binary with a normalized separation similar to the einstein radius of the lens @xmath6 , a single large caustic with six cusps forms around the center of mass of the binary . for a wide binary ,",
    "there exist two four - cusp caustics each of which is located close to each lens components . for a close binary , there are three caustics with one four - cusp caustic located near the barycenter of the binary while the other two three - cusp caustics are located away from the center of mass .",
    "the close / wide degeneracy in the interpretation of a binary - lens light curve occurs due to the similarity in shape between the central caustic of a close binary and either caustic of a wide binary @xcite .",
    "the binary - lens parameters of the pair of degenerate close / wide binaries are related by @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the projected separations and the mass ratios of the degenerate sets of the close and wide binaries , respectively @xcite . in the present context , it is important to emphasize that the degeneracy becomes especially severe when the normalized separation is either substantially smaller @xmath11 or larger @xmath12 than the einstein radius @xcite .",
    "the existence of a binary companion additionally affects lensing light curves due to the orbital motion of the binary @xcite .",
    "the effect of the orbital motion is twofold .",
    "first , it makes the projected binary separation vary in time , causing the shape and size of a caustic to vary during the event .",
    "second , it also causes the projected binary axis to rotate with respect to the source trajectory , which is equivalent to the lens - source relative motion deviating from rectilinear .    the orbital effect of a binary lens can provide a useful tool that allows one to resolve the close / wide degeneracy .",
    "the physical einstein radius of a typical galactic bulge event is @xmath31  2 au .",
    "then , orbital periods of wide binaries would be substantially longer than a year .",
    "considering that typical durations of binary - induced deviations are of order of 10 days , then , the orbital effect on the light curve of a wide binary event would be negligible .",
    "by contrast , orbital periods of close binaries can be small and thus the change of the lens position caused by the orbital motion during the deviating part of a lensing event can be important for some close binary events . hence",
    ", if it is found that the orbital effect is needed to describe an observed light curve , the close binary interpretation would be the correct one between two the possible close / wide binary interpretations .",
    "on the other hand , if the orbital motion is constrained to be extremely small , this would not absolutely rule out the close - binary solution , because the projected separation of a binary with a large semi - major axis can be small when the binary axis is aligned with the line of sight .",
    "however , because such extreme projections are a priori unlikely , strong upper limits on orbital motion would statistically favor wide solutions .",
    "we apply the orbit - based method of resolving the close / wide binary degeneracy to an actually observed event moa-2011-blg-040/ogle-2011-blg-0001 .",
    "the event was discovered from the survey conducted by the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) group on 2011-mar-12 toward the galactic bulge at @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 , based on observation using the 1.8 m telescope at mt .",
    "john observatory in new zealand @xcite .",
    "the event was also independently discovered in may 2011 by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) , immediately after commissioning of the early warning system ( ews ) of microlensing event detections @xcite for ogle - iv phase .",
    "ogle - iv has been conducted since march 2010 with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope and 32 ccd detector mosaic camera at las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "reductions of data were processed using photometry codes developed by the individual groups .",
    "figure [ fig : one ] shows the light curve of moa-2011-blg-040/ogle-2011-blg-0001 .",
    "it exhibits a deviation from the unperturbed single - lens light curve near the peak .",
    "the deviation is composed of multiple features .",
    "one at @xmath15 , shows a typical caustic - crossing feature of a strong spike . another feature is the bump at @xmath16 .",
    "located between the two features is an extended negative deviation region that lasted for @xmath36 days .    in modeling the light curve of the event ,",
    "we search for a solution of lensing parameters that best describes the observed light curve . for the basic description of a binary - lens light curve ,",
    "seven lensing parameters are needed .",
    "the first three describe the relative lens - source motion , including the time of the closest of the source star approach to the center of mass of the binary lens , @xmath17 , the lens - source separation at that moment , @xmath18 , and the time scale for the source to cross the einstein radius , @xmath19 ( einstein time scale ) .",
    "another three parameters are related to the binary nature of the lens , including the normalized projected binary separation , @xmath2 , the mass ratio between the binary components , @xmath4 , and the angle between the source trajectory and the binary axis , @xmath20 .",
    "the last parameter is @xmath21 , the angular source radius @xmath22 normalized by the angular einstein radius .",
    "the normalized source radius @xmath23 is needed to account for the finite - source effect which affects lensing magnifications during caustic crossings or approaches . with these parameters ,",
    "the solution of the lensing parameters is searched by minimizing @xmath24 in a parameter space .",
    "this is done by a combination of grid search and down - hill approach .",
    "the grid search is done in the space of the parameters ( @xmath2,@xmath4,@xmath20 ) , which are related to features of lensing curves in a complex way . for the @xmath24 minimization in the down - hill approach ,",
    "we use the markov chain monte carlo method . considering the possibility of the existence of degenerate close and wide binary solutions ,",
    "the search is done in the parameter space that is wide enough to encompass both binary solutions . from this search , we find a pair of degenerate close and wide binary solutions .",
    "although the overall shape of the observed light curve can be fitted with the basic binary lensing parameters , there are significant residuals to the fit .",
    "this gives a hint that second - order effects should be taken into account .",
    "considering a long duration of the event , which lasted @xmath3100 days , we examine the effect of the lens orbital motion and the parallax effect .",
    "the latter effect is caused by the positional change of the observer because of the earth s orbital motion around the sun @xcite .",
    "it is known that the parallax effect results in a long - term deviation in lensing light curves similar to the effect of the binary - lens orbital motion @xcite and thus we consider both effects simultaneously .",
    "to first order approximation , the lens orbital motion is described by two parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which represent the change rates of the normalized binary separation and the source trajectory angle , respectively .",
    "the parallax effect requires another two parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are the components of the lens parallax vector @xmath29 projected on the sky along the north and east equatorial coordinates , respectively .",
    "the direction of the parallax vector corresponds to the relative lens - source motion in the frame of the earth at a specific time of the event .",
    "the amplitude of the parallax vector is the ratio of the size of the earth s orbit to the einstein radius projected on the observer plane .",
    "we find that taking account of these second - order effects significantly improves the fit for both the close and wide binary solutions .",
