    "the top quark was discovered in 1995 by the cdf @xcite and d  @xcite experiments at the fermilab tevatron proton - antiproton collider .",
    "the mass of the top quark , which is by far the heaviest of all quarks , plays an important role in electroweak radiative corrections and therefore in constraining the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "precise measurements of the top quark mass provide a crucial test of the consistency of the standard model ( sm ) and could indicate a hint of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the tevatron is still the only place where top quarks can be produced and studied directly . at the tevatron , top quarks",
    "are mostly produced in pairs via the strong interaction . in the framework of the sm",
    ", the top quark decays to a @xmath4 boson and a @xmath5 quark nearly 100% of the time .",
    "events from top quark pair production are classified according to the @xmath4 boson decay channels .",
    "an event is referred to as `` dilepton '' if both @xmath4 bosons decay leptonically , `` all jets '' if both @xmath4 bosons decay hadronically , and `` lepton+jets '' channel if one of the @xmath4 boson decays leptonically in either and electron or muon and the corresponding neutrino and the other one hadronically . in this report measurements of the top quark mass in the lepton+jets channel are presented .",
    "the selected events are required to contain an isolated electron or muon and at least or exactly four jets with high transverse momenta and large missing transverse energy .",
    "the dominant background contribution is @xmath4 boson production with associated jets ( @xmath4+jets ) .",
    "the second largest background is multijet production where a jet is misidentified as a lepton and large missing transverse energy is faked . by identifying @xmath5 jets in the final state , these background contributions can be substantially reduced .",
    "different methods to measure the top quark mass are discussed .",
    "`` template methods ''  @xcite have the advantage of being more straightforward and transparent but are statistically less accurate . to maximize the statistical information on the top quark mass extracted from the event sample , more elaborated but also more complex methods exist as e.g. the `` matrix method ''  @xcite , the `` ideogram method ''  @xcite or the `` dynamical likelihood method ''  @xcite .",
    "an alternative method uses the cross section measurement to extract the top quark mass  @xcite .",
    "some examples are presented here .",
    "distributions of variables that are strongly correlated with the top quark mass are derived as templates in monte carlo simulations for different top mass hypotheses .",
    "they are compared to the measured distribution in order to extract the top quark mass from data .    in @xcite",
    "two variables are used .",
    "first , the reconstructed top quark mass @xmath6 is derived by minimizing a @xmath7-like function to the over - constrained kinematics of the @xmath8 system using the measured 4-vectors of the charged lepton and the jets , the measured missing transverse energy and @xmath5-tagging information .",
    "it is summed over all possible assignments of partons to jets .",
    "the well - known @xmath4 mass is used to constrain the invariant mass of the electron / muon - neutrino pair from the leptonic @xmath4 decay and the dijet mass from the hadronic @xmath4 decay .",
    "the top quark and antitop quark masses are constrained to be equal within the top width . as second variable the dijet mass of the hadronically decaying @xmath4 boson is used .",
    "it constrains the so - called jet energy scale _ in situ _ which represents the largest systematic uncertainty in top quark mass measurements .    the values of both variables for candidate events with at least 1 @xmath5-tag",
    "are compared to a two - dimensional probability density function derived by applying a kernel density estimation to fully simulated mc events for different values of the top quark mass and jet energy scale .",
    "the measurement is performed simultaneously in the lepton+jets and dilepton channels . the 2-dimensional likelihood is presented in fig .  [ 2dlhood ] ( upper left ) . as a result ,",
    "a top quark mass of @xmath9  gev was derived .",
    "the total accuracy is thus @xmath10% .      to be less dependent on the largest systematic uncertainty of the previous method , in @xcite quantities",
    "are used with minimal dependence on the jet energy scale .",
    "one variable is the transverse decay length of @xmath5-tagged jets , and the other is the transverse momentum of the lepton",
    ". both quantities are roughly linearly dependent on the top mass .",
    "their combination significantly reduces the statistical uncertainty because the statistical resolution in the top mass determination is similar and they are approximately uncorrelated . as a result",
    ", the top quark mass was measured to @xmath11  gev .",
    "this corresponds to a total uncertainty of 3.9% .",
    "since the result is statistically limited , it will improve with more data added in the future , or if the measurement is performed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .      for the matrix element method a probability is calculated for each event as a function of the assumed top quark mass @xmath12 and an overall multiplicative scale factor jes for jet energies .",
    "the factor jes is fitted _ in situ _ in data , simultaneously with the top quark mass by using information from the invariant mass of the hadronically decaying @xmath4 boson . for every event ,",
    "this mass is constrained to be equal to the known value for the @xmath4 mass .",
    "the probabilities from all events in the sample are then combined to obtain a probability as a function of @xmath12 and jes , and the top quark mass is extracted by finding the values that maximize this probability .",
    "the analyses performed by the cdf  @xcite and d  @xcite experiments are very similar .",
    "one main difference is the treatment of background . while in  @xcite a neural network discriminant",
    "is used to distinguish signal from background , in  @xcite the probability for one event is composed from probabilities not only for top quark pair production signal but also for @xmath4+jets background .    for both measurements pseudo - experiments using a large pool of fully simulated mc events",
    "are performed to calibrate the method , correcting for biases to ensure that the fitted parameters represent true values and that the estimated errors can be trusted .",
    "the two - dimensional likelihoods on data events are shown in fig .",
    "[ 2dlhood ] ( upper right for cdf and lower left for d ) . as a result",
    "the top quark mass is measured to @xmath13  gev by cdf  @xcite and @xmath14  gev by d  @xcite .",
    "the total uncertainties for both measurements are @xmath15% .",
    "they are systematically limited .",
    "the largest sources of systematic uncertainties apart from the simultaneous inclusion of jes are given by residual jes , in particular of @xmath5-jets , and theoretical uncertainties in signal and background modeling .",
    "currently both experiments are undertaking large efforts to get a uniform treatment of all uncertainties where ever possible .",
    "+        the value of a quark mass is renormalization - scheme dependent .",
    "thus it is important to extract this parameter using a well - defined renormalization scheme .",
    "direct top quark mass measurements as discussed previously compare measured distributions to distributions simulated by leading - order mc generators as a function of the top quark mass .",
    "the input mass for these mc generators is not in a well - defined renormalization scheme leading to an uncertainty in its definition .",
    "this can be avoided when the top quark mass is extracted by comparing top pair production cross section measurements to fully inclusive theoretical calculations in higher - order qcd .",
    "they include soft gluon resummations and represent the most complete calculations available .",
    "furthermore , they are worked out using the pole mass definition for the top quark which is thus the parameter extracted here .",
    "the experimental and theoretical cross sections as a function of the top mass were fitted using third - order polynomials in the top quark mass and likelihoods were defined .",
    "the theoretical and experimental likelihoods are multiplied to obtain a joint likelihood as a function of the top mass .",
    "the extracted top mass is given by the minimum of the likelihood function .",
    "as an example , the combination of the @xmath8 cross sections derived in the lepton+jets  @xcite , dilepton  @xcite and lepton+tau  @xcite decay channels as described in  @xcite is compared to a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculation that includes all next - to - next - to - leading logarithms ( nnll ) that are relevant in next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd  @xcite .",
    "this is shown together with the joint likelihood in fig .",
    "[ 2dlhood ] ( lower right ) .",
    "the extracted top quark pole mass is @xmath16  gev .",
    "the total uncertainty is thus @xmath17% .",
    "taking correlated uncertainties properly into account the cdf and d  collaborations have derived separate combinations of published run - i ( 19921996 ) measurements with the most recent preliminary run - ii ( 2001present ) measurements using up to @xmath18 of data .",
    "the new cdf combination  @xcite gives @xmath19  gev , the new dcombination  @xcite @xmath20  gev .",
    "these results were combined to the new world average  @xcite of @xmath21  gev .",
    "this corresponds to a relative precision of 0.7% on the top quark mass .",
    "various measurements of the top quark mass in the lepton+jets channel and combinations with other channels were presented .",
    "the most precise measurements today are systematically limited .",
    "the main challenge right now is thus to work on reducing the experimental and theoretical uncertainties where ever possible . to get a better understanding of the interpretation of the measured quantity with respect to",
    "the applied renormalization scheme will be an important task for the future .",
