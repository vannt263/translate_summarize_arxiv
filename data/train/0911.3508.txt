    "the multitude of models has been confronted with data , and the compete collaboration  @xcite gathered and cleaned the datasets which are now available on the servers of the particle data group  @xcite , and which gather all the soft data measured at @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ the total cross sections and the @xmath8 parameters when available , for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these data have some drawbacks .",
    "first of all , most cross sections have been measured at isr energies , and there is a gap from @xmath15 gev to @xmath16 gev .",
    "this gap would have been filled by the pp2pp collaboration at rhic , but it has unfortunately been stopped .",
    "another problem comes from the highest - energy data , where a @xmath17 disagreement exists between e710 and cdf .",
    "finally , the compatibility of the various measurements of @xmath8 at isr energies is questionable , and not enough information has been published to redo the analyses .",
    "r0.45        nevertheless , compete considered several hundreds of possible parametrisations , based on simple , double or triple poles , and kept only those which had a global @xmath18/point smaller than 1 , for @xmath19 gev . from these",
    ", one can predict the total cross section at the lhc , and estimate the error due to the extrapolation .",
    "figure 1 shows the result of this study .",
    "the extrapolation of the parametrisations which passed the @xmath18 test is given by the outer band .",
    "it predicts 84 mb @xmath20 mb for @xmath21  tev , and 90117 mb for 14 tev .    the inner band of fig .  1 shows the best guess , and it is based on a series of statistical indicators explained in  @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to a universal triple - pole ( @xmath22 ) parametrisation .",
    "one should note that the multiple - pole fits have some peculiar properties : in the triple - pole case , the contribution of the pomeron @xmath23 with @xmath2 for energies smaller than 6 gev , whereas in the double - pole case , it actually becomes negative below 9.5 gev .",
    "simple poles seem to be excluded , but they can be considered again if the lower cut - off on the energy is raised to 10 gev .",
    "the multiple - pole parametrisations have been used successfully  @xcite to reproduce low-@xmath24 data in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) , showing that universality does not seem to hold in general , as the coefficient of the triple pole depends on @xmath25 .",
    "more recently , multiple poles have been used successfully  @xcite to reproduce the differential elastic cross sections  @xcite .",
    "hence multiple - pole fits seem to work , but it is hard to imagine how such a structure may emerge from qcd . on the other hand , simple - pole fits have a simple phenomenology , a simple interpretation as the exchange of glueballs , and only a handful of parameters .",
    "clearly , one simple - pole pomeron has never been a reasonable choice : in their original soft - pomeron model  @xcite , donnachie and landshoff included a two - pomeron cut , which lowers the cross section , and which enables one to go to @xmath26 tev before unitarity is broken",
    ". however , such a simple model seems to produce worse fits than multiple poles .",
    "furthermore , hera data on dis and on vector - meson production have lead to the introduction of a second singularity @xcite , taken also as a simple pole , and mimicking the bfkl cut .",
    "one can indeed follow the standard transformation to the @xmath1-plane to convince oneself that hadronic singularities must be present in dis  @xcite .",
    "this new singularity has a coupling which depends on @xmath25 , or on the vector - meson mass , and , together with the soft pomeron , it enables one to reproduce all hera measurements  @xcite .",
    "the question then is to know whether such a singularity might be present in soft data .",
    "it actually came as a surprise that , indeed , the introduction of a hard pole brings the simple - pole pomeron fit on equal footing with multiple poles , as far as the @xmath18/point is concerned  @xcite .",
    "this is true provided that one stops the fit at @xmath27 gev . beyond that",
    ", the hard pole must be unitarised , as its contribution to the total cross section would be much too large .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that a global fit to soft data leads to a hard pomeron with an intercept @xmath28 , perfectly compatible with that obtained by donnachie and landshoff in dis .",
    "it must be noted however that the coupling of the hard pomeron is tiny .",
    "it contributes at most 7% to the total cross section for @xmath29  gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : relative ] .",
    "previous studies  @xcite considered only fits to the highest energy , in which case the hard pomeron coupling becomes extremely small . even if the energy is limited to 200 gev , the coupling remains of the order of 1% of that of the soft pomeron .",
    "r0.45        the two - pomeron model was later applied to the differential elastic cross section in  @xcite , where it was shown that the hard pomeron was compatible with data on the first cone ( 0.1 gev@xmath30 gev@xmath31 ) , for energies smaller than 100 gev , although in this case it did not significantly improve the fit .",
    "note also that the form factors of the various exchanges were directly extracted from the data , confirming the presence of a zero in the form factor of the @xmath32 trajectory , and suggesting one for the @xmath33 meson trajectory .",
    "one has thus found an alternative to the multiple - pole fits : the two - pomeron model , which can reproduce dis data , photoproduction data , soft forward data and differential elastic cross section , provided one stays at moderate energy and small @xmath34 . as we shall now see , if this model is the correct one , then it may have important consequences at the lhc .",
    "indeed , to go to higher energies , one must confront the question of unitarisation . at high energy ,",
    "the partial waves can be obtained by a fourier transform of the amplitude @xmath35 to impact - parameter space , as @xmath36 .",
    "the unitarity constraint can then be written @xmath37 it is easy to see that this means that the complex @xmath38 has to be in a circle of radius 1 centred at @xmath39 , which we shall call the unitarity circle ( note that another normalisation is frequently used , where the circle has radius 1 and is centred at @xmath40 . )    in our two - pomeron model , the amplitude @xmath41 leaves the unitarity circle for energies slightly below the tevatron , and it is quite far out at the lhc , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : unita ] .",
    "the problem , of course , is that one does not know exactly how the amplitude will stay in the unitarity circle .",
    "it is known that multi - pomeron exchanges , and maybe multi - pomeron vertices , will restore unitarity . but how to implement these ingredients is far from unique  @xcite .",
    "even the simplest two - pomeron cut is not fully calculable , let alone a full resummation .",
    "mathematically , unitarisation schemes can be classified into three classes .",
    "the first one maps the whole upper - half complex plane onto the unitarity circle . in this class",
    ", one finds the eikonal scheme , and the @xmath4-matrix scheme  @xcite .",
    "note that the latter is the only one to provide a one - to - one mapping between the half - plane and the circle , but the amplitude also has a new pole at @xmath42 .",
    "the second class is a simple extension of the first one : instead of mapping the upper half - plane to the full unitarity circle , one maps it to a smaller circle , still centred at @xmath39 .",
    "the third class , which we recently proposed  @xcite , maps a given amplitude to the circle , which is far less restrictive than mapping the half plane . in general",
    ", these schemes can have very different properties  @xcite : they can lead to the pumplin bound ( @xmath43  @xcite ) and to shadowing , but it is also possible to have anti - shadowing and @xmath44 , both for eikonal - like and @xmath4-matrix - like schemes .",
    "i shall not consider these more exotic possibilities here , but one has to bear in mind that they can not be a priori ruled out .",
    "0.3 cm    -0.5",
    "cm        as we do not know what scheme to use , we have decided to be conservative , and to unitarise the two - pomeron model using the simplest and most conservative approach .",
    "the minimal scheme assumes that something happens when the amplitude reaches the unitarity bound , and one simply cuts - off the amplitude at 1",
    ". we shall call it the saturation scheme . note that to do that while preserving analytic properties",
    "is not very simple , but nevertheless it can be done  @xcite .",
    "the other scheme is the standard one - channel eikonal .",
    "using either of these schemes produces an amplitude which respects unitarity , and thus can be used to predict the total cross section at the lhc .",
    "the first scheme keeps by definition the results of the fit below the tevatron energy , and thus one can keep the parameters of the low - energy simple - pole fit .",
    "the eikonal on the other hand changes slightly the low - energy results , and thus necessitates some re- fitting .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] .",
    "one sees that , in this very simple approach , the total cross section could be as large as 150 mb .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar number has been obtained by landshoff , in a very different manner  @xcite .",
    "the unitarised two - pomeron model has a consequence that has been overlooked so far .",
    "as the energy grows , the protons become blacker , and edgier . this in turn changes the diffraction pattern , _",
    "i.e. _ the exponential slope of the cross section varies quickly with @xmath46 : the differential cross section can not be approximated any longer by @xmath47 with @xmath48 constant . in turn , the real part of the amplitude also develops a strong @xmath46 dependence , and @xmath49 could be as large as 0.24 .",
    "we have checked that this is the case for the eikonal scheme , and for the saturation scheme  @xcite , and show the results for the latter in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhob ] .",
    "l0.45        a hadronic slope @xmath48 almost constant with @xmath46 for @xmath50 gev@xmath31 and a small @xmath8 parameter are standard assumptions for the planned measurement of the total cross section  @xcite",
    ". if the two - pomeron model is correct , then these assumptions will be wrong , and we can evaluate the systematic uncertainty that they will generate .",
    "so , we have used our unitarised two - pomeron model  @xcite to simulate data , using bins and errors similar to those of the ua4/2 experiment  @xcite , and including the coulomb - nucleon interference  @xcite .",
    "we then performed the standard analysis on these simulated data , and extracted a measurement of the total cross section , which we could compare to the input value from our model .",
    "the result of this analysis is that the extracted value of the total cross section will systematically overshoot the model value by about 10 mb in a luminosity - dependent method , and about 15 mb in a luminosity - independent one .",
    "hence , an additional study of the @xmath46 dependence of the slope and of the @xmath8 parameter will be needed before one reaches the 1 % precision level .",
    "the measurement of the total cross section at the lhc will tell us a lot about the analytic structure of the amplitude , as there is a variety of predictions that span the region from 90 to 230 mb :    * @xmath51 mb : the only unitarisation scheme able to accommodate such a large number is the @xmath4 matrix  @xcite .",
    "it basically predicts the same inelastic cross section as more standard schemes , but the elastic cross section is much larger , and accounts for the difference . *",
    "120 mb @xmath52 mb : this would be a clear signal for a two - pomeron model , and would also tell us about the unitarisation scheme . * @xmath53 mb : this is the standard prediction not only of the compete fits , but also of many models based on a simple eikonal and only one pomeron pole . * @xmath54 mb : this would indicate either the validity of double - pole parametrisations , or that of unitarisation schemes in which multiple - pomeron vertices are important  @xcite .    and",
    "finally , if one really enters a new regime at the lhc , the study of the @xmath46 dependence of the elastic cross section , and of the real part of the amplitude , may be of great importance to unravel the underlying dynamics and to improve the experimental measurement of @xmath45 .",
