    "hydromagnetic dynamos can be understood as a magnetic instability driven by a flow pattern in fluid conductors .",
    "there are , however , strong restrictions on the characteristics of flows that can excite dynamos @xcite , as well as on the geometry of the resulting magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the restrictions even exclude any dynamo activity for a number of flows , for example , differential rotation alone can never maintain a dynamo .",
    "an open question is whether magnetic instabilities are able to excite a sufficiently complicated motion that together with the background flow can generate magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite suggested that nonuniformly rotating disks can produce a dynamo when magnetorotational ( mri ) and magnetic buoyancy instabilities are active .",
    "later on , numerical simulations have shown that the mri alone may be sufficient for the accretion disk dynamo . however , at least for low magnetic prandtl numbers , it remains unclear whether the mri - dynamo is physical , or just a numerical artifact .",
    "another possibility was discussed by spruit ( 2002 ) , who suggested that differential rotation and a magnetic kink - type instability @xcite can together drive a dynamo in stellar radiation zones .",
    "if real , such a dynamo would be very important for angular momentum transport in stars .",
    "it taps energy from differential rotation , thus reducing the rotational shear .",
    "radial velocity fluctuations converting toroidal magnetic field into poloidal field are necessary for such a dynamo .",
    "this dynamo , therefore , would necessarily also mix chemicals in stellar interiors , which may have consequences for stellar evolution .",
    "however , simply the action of differential rotation and a magnetic instability converting toroidal field into poloidal does not guarantee such a dynamo , which has thus far not been proven to exist .",
    "doubts are especially directed to the kink - type instability which , in contrast to the mri , exists even without differential rotation and develops at the expense of the magnetic energy .",
    "detailed estimations of the dynamo parameters are thus necessary to assess any dynamo - efficiency of the tayler instability .",
    "a basic aspect of turbulent dynamos is the ability of correlated magnetic ( @xmath3 ) and velocity ( @xmath4 ) fluctuations to produce a mean electromotive force along the background magnetic field @xmath5 , and also along the electric current @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 we computed the @xmath8 effect of the current - driven instability for rigid rotation and for a 3d magnetic geometry in a previous paper ( rdiger et al .",
    "however , because a magnetic - instability - induced radiative - zone dynamo requires a differential rotation as an energy source , it remains to find the instability and the resulting electromotive force in the presence of a ( weak ) differential rotation .",
    "we have shown earlier that the interaction of even current - free toroidal fields and differential rotation leads to the appearance of an own instability where the growth rates ( for fixed magnetic field amplitude ) switch from the low diffusion frequency to the high rotation frequency",
    ". it would therefore not be surprising if the current - driven instability under the presence of differential rotation exceeded the power of the instability with no rotation or with rigid rotation .",
    "indeed , for toroidal fields in cylindrical geometry one can show that for rigid rotation the instability is suppressed for too weak toroidal magnetic field ( acheson 1978 ; pitts & tayler 1985 ; tataronis & mond 1987 ) , while it is re - animated by differential rotation ( see rdiger et al . 2013 ) . in the present paper",
    "we shall apply a linear theory to show that similar results are obtained even in non - uniformly rotating spheres with northern and southern magnetic belts of opposite direction .",
    "the formation of red giants without internal angular momentum transport would lead to steep radial profiles of the internal rotation law .",
    "ceillier et al .",
    "( 2012 ) report the kepler - like profile @xmath9 for the low - mass red giant kic 7341231 .",

    ", the core rotates only slightly faster than the outer convection zone ( deheuvels et al .",
    "2012 , 2014 ) .",
    "eggenberger et al .",
    "( 2012 ) argue that an artificial viscosity of @xmath10 @xmath11/s may explain the surprisingly flat rotation profiles .",
    "the outward flux of angular momentum then produces the observed spin - down of the inner radiative core .",
    "the general condition for this mechanism to work is that _ the rotation profile decays faster than the magnetic field_. the magnetic prandtl number represents the ratio of the decay time of the magnetic field and the decay time of the differential rotation .",
    "this basic requirement is thus fulfilled when the effective magnetic prandtl number is much larger than unity .",
    "we have thus to study whether and under what circumstances the magnetic prandtl number becomes large .",
    "the model and the stability analysis of this paper are close to those of @xcite and will be discussed here only briefly .",
    "the main idea is the use of the very small but necessarily nonzero radial flow component as the free parameter of the eigenvalue system , which is assumed to be proportional to the product of the critical length scale and the growth rate of the unstable mode .",
    "the special choice of this parameter always becomes unimportant for the results , which can be understood as the ratio of second - order quantities as there are the energy ratios and/or the effective magnetic prandtl number formed by the diffusivity coefficients .",
    "the dominant component of the magnetic field inside a star is assumed to be the toroidal one , which can easily be produced by differential rotation by induction from a weak poloidal field .",
    "the background toroidal field of our model consists of two latitudinal belts of opposite polarities @xmath12 ( see spruit 1999 ) with @xmath13 as the alfvn frequency of the toroidal field .",
    "spherical coordinates are used with the axis of rotation as the polar axis ; @xmath14 is the azimuthal unit vector and @xmath15 .",
    "field belts with equatorial symmetry are described by functions @xmath16 which are symmetric with respect to the equator . on the other hand ,",
    "the simplest case with two belts of opposite signs in the two hemispheres is @xmath17 . the latitudinal profile of ( [ 2 ] )",
    "then peaks in mid - latitudes at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 is referred in the following as the _ amplitude _ of @xmath20 . within the solar tachocline toroidal fields of ( say ) 1 kg are represented by @xmath21 .    the background flow is simply @xmath22 with @xmath23 as the equatorial rotation rate . for @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 , one finds @xmath26 with @xmath27 the alfvn velocity , which is stable according to the formulation of chandrasekhar ( 1956 ) for ideal , perfectly - conducting fluids .",
    "more realistic @xmath16 and @xmath23 are radius - dependent , but this dependence is not of basic importance for the analysis of barytropic instabilities .",
    "the reason is that the stratification of the radiative core is stable with positive @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the specific entropy and @xmath30 the specific heat for constant pressure .",
    "we shall see that the latitudinal shear of the global rotation is much more important .",
    "let the rotation law be given by @xmath31 with @xmath0 as the shear parameter of the normalized differential rotation .",
    "@xmath32 is the angular velocity of the equator , positive @xmath0 describes ( ` solar - type ' ) equatorial acceleration .",
    "this is the typical definition for the tachocline theory : the outer convection zone above the radiative interior generates equatorial acceleration at its bottom which defines the shear at the top of the radiation zone .",
    "in the upper solar radiative core for red giants ] the buoyancy frequency @xmath33 is large compared to @xmath23 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the radial scale of unstable disturbances is then short , and the dependence of the disturbances on the radius can be treated by the local approximation with @xmath35 .",
    "a normalized wavelength of the perturbations is @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the most unstable disturbances have @xmath38 so that the radial scale of the disturbances , @xmath39 , does not exceed 1000 km ( for solar values ) , which is certainly shorter than both the radial scales of the toroidal field or the angular velocity of rotation . for such short scales",
    "the local approximation in the radial coordinate is always applicable .",
    "the unstable modes in our analysis , however , remain global in their horizontal dimensions .",
    "the system of the linear stability theory includes the equation @xmath40 for the velocity disturbances , the equation @xmath41 for the magnetic disturbances , and @xmath42 for the entropy disturbances @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the total fluctuating temperature .",
    "the equations ( [ 6])([8 ] ) were reformulated in terms of scalar potentials for toroidal and poloidal parts of the magnetic and velocity fields , i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the resulting system of five eigenvalue equations can be found elsewhere @xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is solved numerically .",
    "the equations include finite diffusion .",
    "thermal diffusion is especially important because of its destabilizing effect ( acheson 1978 ) .",
    "the radial perturbations are suppressed in radiation zones by buoyancy .",
    "the thermal diffusion smooths out the entropy disturbances , reducing the effect of stable stratification .",
    "the diffusivities enter the normalized equations via the normalized quantities @xmath47 the values of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 characterize the upper part of the solar radiation zone .",
    "it is characteristic for stellar plasma that the magnetic prandtl number ( @xmath51 ) is much larger than the ordinary prandtl number ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "both prandtl numbers match the real situation in solar - type radiation zones .",
    "they are so small that no hope exists to apply direct numerical simulations to the problem .",
    "the smallness of the prandtl numbers even forms a massive challenge for the numerical procedures of the _ linear _ theory .",
    "note that the numerical values of ( [ 9 ] ) for the red subgiants differ from the solar - type values resulting in larger prandtl numbers ( rdiger et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the stability problem allows two types of equatorial symmetry of unstable eigenmodes .",
    "we use the notations s@xmath53 ( symmetric mode with azimuthal wave number @xmath53 ) and a@xmath53 ( antisymmetric mode ) for the single modes .",
    "s@xmath53 modes have vector fields @xmath54 which are mirror - symmetric about the equatorial plane ( symmetric @xmath55 and antisymmetric @xmath56 ) and mirror - antisymmetric flows @xmath57 ( symmetric @xmath58 and antisymmetric @xmath59 ) .",
    "am modes have antisymmetric @xmath54 and symmetric @xmath57 . the instability which is discussed here has only been found for non - axisymmetric disturbances with @xmath60 .",
    "the growth rates of modes with @xmath61 are rather small for weak fields of both symmetry types . for weak fields , @xmath62 ,",
    "the growth rates are fitted very well by the parabolic law @xmath63 . for strong fields , @xmath64 , they are proportional to the field strength @xmath65 , without depending on the rotation rate .",
    "there are obviously two different non - axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "the fast one is the standard tayler instability of adiabatic fluids , while the slow one for finite heat - conductivity is of the double - diffusive type .",
    "the tayler instability for adiabatic fluids exists for magnetic field configurations with equatorial symmetry only for @xmath66 , while this limit is reduced if the dipolar field constellation of the present paper is applied . in this case",
    "a jump exists of the growth rates to higher values at @xmath67 .",
    "the azimuthal drift rates of the unstable @xmath60 modes also differ strongly for the two regimes , as they jump from resting to corotating just at @xmath25 .",
    "the perturbations are considered as fourier modes in time , azimuth and radius , of the form @xmath68 . only the highest - order terms in @xmath69",
    "are used ( i.e. only the shortest waves ) so that in radial direction the theory is a local one .",
    "the wave number @xmath70 enters the equations in the normalized form ( [ 5 ] ) as a ratio of two large numbers .",
    "one can directly read from the equations that the radial flow component and the radial field component are much smaller than the horizontal components .",
    "if the fields are divergence - free then the immediate consequence is that for characteristic values @xmath71 ( and the same for @xmath72 ) . in order to work with quantities of similar numerical values the notation @xmath73",

    "the differences are strikingly small .",

    "the main result is that the shear supports the magnetic instability . yet",
    "the growth rates do not simply depend on the value of @xmath85 .",
    "there are also strong differences for weak and strong background fields . for weak magnetic field the influence of positive and weak shear vanishes ( fig .",

    "for the solar tachocline which may be characterized by @xmath86 and @xmath21 the stability results for rigid rotation thus remain valid also for inhomogeneous rotation laws .",

    "one also finds that @xmath21 is _ stable _ for positive  not too large  shear .         for sufficiently strong shear",
    "the rotation energy is pumped into the instability modes and the growth rates grow for both signs of @xmath0 . figure [ gr1 ] also shows that negative shear strongly destabilizes the toroidal field more than positive shear does .",
    "compared with the growth rates for rigid rotation a shear of only @xmath88 increases the growth rate by one order of magnitude .",
    "this is true , however , only for @xmath89 . for strong magnetic fields",
    "the negative shear slightly suppresses the instability while strong enough positive shear destabilizes it ( fig .",
    "[ gr1 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs in simulations of the kink - type instability for small magnetic prandtl numbers in cylindrical geometry for strong fields .",
    "the interaction of shear and toroidal field modifies the relations between the growth rates and the magnetic field amplitudes .",
    "e.g. , the growth rates for strong antisolar rotation laws ( @xmath90 ) seem to indicate a linear dependence on @xmath1 rather than the standard @xmath91-relation .",
    "the tayler instability for @xmath92 is a different phenomenon than the double diffusive instability for @xmath89 .",
    "the drift rates differ strongly for weak and strong magnetic background fields , while the influence of @xmath0 is rather weak for weak fields .",
    "it has been found earlier that the modes with @xmath61 are corotating with the star for weak fields ( @xmath89 ) , but they are stationary in the inertial frame for stronger background fields .",
    "note that the non - axisymmetric tayler instability without rotation is also stationary in the laboratory system and that for large @xmath1 the influence of the rotation becomes weaker and weaker .",
    "it becomes thus understandable that for @xmath93 the instability pattern becomes stationary in the inertial frame .",
    "the influence of the shear can easily be described for weak field amplitudes .",
    "the drift in the corotating system is simply @xmath94 .",
    "it means that for a solar - type rotation law ( @xmath95 ) the pattern no longer rotates with the equatorial rotation rate .",
    "the rotation rate of the poles is @xmath96 , hence the pattern corotates with the mid - latitudes which is also true for negative @xmath0 .      also the wavelengths of the instability pattern depend on the applied shear _ and _ on the background - field amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ wl1 ] ) .",
    "strong fields produce the smallest radial scales which hardly depend on the shear which is also known from the growth rates ( see fig .",
    "[ gr1 ] , right ) . for negative shear",
    "the wavelengths are nearly independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for weaker fields , however , and",
    "non - negative shear the results are much more complex .",
    "one finds that for weak fields the wavelengths are maximal for medium magnetic fields ( @xmath97 ) but they are reduced for weaker and for stronger fields . for positive shear the normalized wavelengths exceed the wavelengths for negative shear by one order of magnitude . for weak fields",
    "this trend does not comply with the behavior of the growth rates as shown in fig .",
    "[ gr1 ] .    of particular interest is the strong influence of very weak ( @xmath98% ) positive and negative shear . for such values",
    "there is a steep and linear slope of the critical wavelengths with the numerical value of @xmath0 if the field is not too strong .",
    "obviously , there are two different regimes for weak and for strong shear .     for the @xmath60 modes antisymmetric with respect to the equator vs. rotational shear .",
    "the curves are marked with their values of the background field .",
    "note the massive differences between the solutions with positive and negative shear .",
    "strong fields @xmath92 only allow very short waves ( see also table 1 ) . ]      for rigid rotation we already know that the kinetic energy @xmath99 for strong fields is almost in equipartition with the magnetic energy @xmath100 in contrast to the weak - field models with @xmath89 where the magnetic energy dominates ( rdiger et al .",
    "2012 ) . here",
    "the ratio @xmath101 of the two energies is calculated as averaged over latitude and longitude under the influence of differential rotation .",
    "the radial field and flow values can be neglected in the calculation of ( [ ratio ] ) as they are much smaller than the horizontal components .",
    "it is , nevertheless , _ not _ allowed to ignore them entirely in the equations as they must remain finite in order that the instability mechanism works .    as always for the solutions of a homogeneous system of linear eigen - equations ,",

    "models with positive shear are more magnetically dominated than models with negative shear . only for weak fields",
    "does the magnetic energy strongly exceed the kinetic energy . ]",
    "the situation does hardly change for models with finite shear .",
    "the values of @xmath107 are sligthly reduced for negative shear and they are increased for positive shear for all @xmath1 . if  simplifying  the maxwell stress is considered to produce the eddy viscosity and the reynolds stress is considered to produce the magnetic diffusivity then the effective ( `` turbluent '' ) magnetic prandtl number @xmath108 should result as very large only for small @xmath1 . for strong fields with @xmath1 of order unity also the ratio ( [ schmidt ] ) becomes o(1 ) . in this case",
    "a possible differential rotation would decay with the same time scale as the toroidal magnetic field . for large magnetic prandtl numbers ( [ schmidt ] ) the nonuniform rotation law decays much faster than the magnetic field .    in summary , for the given small microscopic prandtl numbers the kinetic and magnetic patterns of the kink - type instability are anisotropic and magnetically dominated for @xmath89 but they are isotropic and equipartitioned for background fields with @xmath92 .",
    "only positive shear produces higher values for the energy [ ratio ] ) describing a dominance of the magnetic energy .",
    "it is clear that the calculation of the eddy diffusivity is complicated by the high degree of anisotropy in the flow and the field fluctuations , which are characteristic for instability in stratified media .",
    "it is also clear that a radial gradient of a toroidal field is dissipated by small - scale radial motions while a latitudinal gradient of the same field is dissipated by latitudinal small - scale motions .",
    "the eddy diffusivity in anisotropic turbulence is thus described by a tensor with different components in the radial and the horizontal directions . here",

    "it is known that rotating anisotropic turbulence fields behave in a non - boussinesq way , in the sense that angular momentum is transported even for solid - body rotation . as this ` @xmath160 effect ' prevents rigid rotation from being a solution of the reynolds equation , it has been used to explain the equatorial acceleration which can be observed at the solar surface and the surface of many solar - type stars ( see rdiger 1989 , with many references therein ) .",
    "it is shown in the following that the @xmath160 effect also occurs in the theory of magnetic instabilities , so that it is obvious that also in magnetized stellar radiative zones solid - body rotation can not exist as a solution of the stationary equations .",
    "we shall show that the effect is only small for weak fields but its power grows for growing magnetic background fields .",
    "in contrast to spruit ( 2002 ) we focus on the latitudinal transport of angular momentum which is the natural choice if the rotation law has the structure ( [ om ] ) which is characteristic for radiative zones below a convection zone which drives a latitudinal @xmath23-gradient .",
    "the radial transport is weaker by orders of magnitudes although strong enough to produce the radially - uniform rotation of the solar interior .",
    "the latitudinal angular momentum transport for latitudinal - dependent rotation rates is due to the combined action of reynolds stress and maxwell stress and can generally be written as @xmath161 or with ( [ om ] ) as    @xmath162    it consists of two parts .",
    "the first one also exists for rigid rotation while the second one is of a diffusive nature and vanishes for vanishing shear .",
    "the @xmath160 effect always occurs for rotating density - stratified turbulence for sufficiently high rotation rate .     for @xmath84 and for various @xmath1 .",
    "the effect vanishes rapidly for @xmath163 .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath164 ( averaged over latitude ) depends strongly on @xmath1 .",
    "the contribution of the reynolds stress for the given examples is negligible in comparison to the maxwell stress.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for @xmath84 and for various @xmath1 .",

    "the contribution of the reynolds stress for the given examples is negligible in comparison to the maxwell stress.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it is possible to derive from ( [ vis11 ] ) the numerical values of the eddy viscosity and the @xmath160 effect in a similar way as the effective magnetic diffusivity has been derived in the previous section .",
    "for @xmath84 we write @xmath165 which yields the product @xmath166 . here , the correlation function @xmath167 is defined by @xmath168 which is free of the arbitrary parameter @xmath0 .",
    "figures [ q1 ] show the numerical results for the expression ( [ vis3 ] ) for @xmath84 but for various values of the normalized magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "one finds that ( [ vis2 ] ) is positive for all @xmath1 . in opposition",
    "to @xmath141 the @xmath167 possesses a strong inverse dependence on the amplitude of @xmath1 . if again the data are averaged over latitude the relevant expression in ( [ vis2 ] ) then @xmath169 runs with @xmath170 .    obviously , the quantity @xmath171 is positive if the viscosity @xmath172 is positive .",
    "this is true if , by ( [ vis11 ] ) for negative shear @xmath0 and positive @xmath173 , the quantity @xmath167 is always positive , which can indeed be demonstrated . from ( [ vis11 ] ) the @xmath160-coefficient @xmath171 equals @xmath174 if the correlation function @xmath167 provides very small values .",
    "if @xmath171 is known the viscosity @xmath175 then directly follows from the result for @xmath84 . the dependence of the @xmath167 on the shear @xmath0 for the field with @xmath176 is given in fig .",
    "[ q3 ] . for finite and positive shear values",
    "@xmath177 the @xmath167 changes its sign .",
    "one reads from the plots that @xmath178 for @xmath87 and @xmath179 for @xmath74 , hence @xmath180 . from eq .",
    "( [ vis2 ] ) it follows @xmath181     for various shear parameters .",
    "top : @xmath87 , bottom : @xmath74 .",
    "the latitudinal average vanishes for @xmath182 ( top ) and @xmath183 ( bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ]   for various shear parameters .",
    "top : @xmath87 , bottom : @xmath74 .",
    "the latitudinal average vanishes for @xmath182 ( top ) and @xmath183 ( bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ]    on the other hand , the @xmath160 effect prevents the formation of rigid rotation as a stationary solution of the reynolds equation . for @xmath184 angular momentum is transported towards the equator and produces equatorial acceleration .",
    "it is also known that the resulting horizontal shear is approximated by the relation @xmath185 . for the considered magnetized radiative stellar cores the resulting shear is less by two orders of magnitude than the observed shear in the solar convection zone .",
    "both the rotating convective envelope and the rotating magnetized radiative cores show equatorial acceleration  the difference is mainly the magnitude .",
    "for known @xmath171 the eddy viscosity @xmath172 can be obtained from the rhs of ( [ vis2 ] ) by dividing by @xmath171 . the combination of this expression and the result ( [ etar ] ) for the magnetic diffusivity yields the effective magnetic prandtl number @xmath186 where the latter relation valids are here not shown ] for @xmath187 . the ratio",
    "no longer contains the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath188 and @xmath23 .",
    "as expected ( because of the influence of the maxwell stress ) it will be much larger than unity if @xmath189 .",
    "for small @xmath1 the resulting viscosity by far exceeds the eddy diffusivity . for larger magnetic fields ,",
    "however , the magnetic energy is reduced in relation to the kinetic energy so that the effective magnetic prandtl number may approach unity .",
    "this result complies to that given in fig .",
    "[ energy3 ] , which means that the magnetic energy in the instability pattern exceeds the kinetic energy only for weak fields with @xmath89 .",
    "the instability pattern of fields with @xmath102 is _ not _ magnetically dominated .",
    "the instability of a large - scale toroidal magnetic field system with dipolar parity under the influence of a global rotation with latitudinal shear has been studied .",
    "we are able to compute simultaneously the mean stress tensor and the mean electromotive force from one and the same model , which allows the determination of both the effective diffusion coefficients @xmath127 and @xmath172 .",
    "the solution of such linear equation systems always contains an unknown arbitrary amplitude factor , which we have fixed in the present paper by the relation @xmath190 for the radial flow of the instability , with @xmath191 as the critical wavelength and @xmath192 as the maximal growth rate of the modes .",
    "the factor @xmath8 plays the role of the free parameter of the system .",
    "almost all of the numerical applications in this paper concern the upper layer of the solar radiative zone , also called the solar tachocline .",
    "the buoyancy frequency in this region exceeds the rotation rate by a factor of about 400 , which leads to rather slow radial perturbations in comparison to the horizontal ones .",
    "if the alfvn frequency of the toroidal field is taken in units of the rotation rate , i.e. @xmath193 , then weak fields are described by @xmath21 and strong fields by @xmath92 . for rigid rotation and for @xmath194",
    "the resulting radial flow for the instability with @xmath195 is of order 1 mm / s .",
    "the simplest estimate for the diffusion coefficient @xmath196 peaks for @xmath97 and reaches values of 250 in units of the microscopic diffusivity .",
    "this value would lead to a decay of the toroidal magnetic background field after 0.5 gyr .",
    "if the differential rotation shall decay within this time the condition @xmath197 must be fulfilled , otherwise the magnetic field decays faster than the differential rotation .",
    "it is not possible for mhd flows to estimate the effective magnetic prandtl number by simple scale relations , because reynolds and maxwell stresses contribute differently to the two diffusivities . to determine both the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity from one and the same model one has to solve the full equation system and to form the correlations which define the two diffusivities . in ratios of expressions of second order such as the electromotive force and/or the reynolds / maxwell stress the free parameter @xmath8 no longer influences the results .",
    "the inspection of the correlations which provide eddy diffusivity and eddy viscosity reveals an extreme anisotropy of both diffusivity tensors . as the radial components of flow and field of the instability pattern are smaller by orders of magnitudes than the horizontal components , the correlations including @xmath131 and @xmath132 are also smaller by orders of magnitudes than the horizontal correlations .",
    "one must thus be careful with the definition of the magnetic prandtl number . in this paper",
    "only the tensor components of the diffusivities are considered which dissipate both the latitudinal gradients of the background flow and field .",
    "hence , the expressions ( [ ub ] ) and ( [ vis1 ] ) must be computed .",
    "the relation ( [ pm ] ) defines the magnetic prandtl number as the ratio of the diffusion coefficients which result from the eqs .",
    "( [ etar ] ) and ( [ vis2 ] ) .",
    "we indeed find values up to @xmath2 for the effective prandtl number at @xmath97 .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity , however , grows monotonically for growing @xmath1 .",
    "strong fields with @xmath64 thus decay very quickly . for weaker background fields ( @xmath97 )",
    "the latitudinal shear of the global rotation decays 100 times faster than the field itself .",
    "one might thus predict that already after ( say ) 1 myr the radiative stellar cores rotate as a solid body .",
    "this , however , is not completely true .",
    "the calculations show that the magnetic instability transports angular momentum equatorward even for solid - body rotation .",
    "this so - called @xmath160 effect avoids the formation of uniform rotation in the same way as it does in rotating solar and stellar convection zones where it is directly observable .",
    "rigid rotation is no longer a solution of the stationary reynolds equation with lorentz force . as the density gradients and the horizontal anisotropies are weaker the @xmath160 effect for magnetized radiative zones , however ,",
    "is much smaller than in rotating convection zones .",
    "nevertheless , also weak differential rotation permanently produces toroidal fields from fossil poloidal fields , so that their existence during the existence of magnetic instabilities must be the rule rather than the exception .",
