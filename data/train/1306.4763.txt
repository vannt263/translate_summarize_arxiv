    "@xcite have introduced the topological entanglement entropy , which is obtained by the well - designed partition and the clever linear combination of the corresponding entanglement entropies .",
    "it is of interest to look for an explicit microscopic model that realizes quantum order characterized by the topological entanglement entropy .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the microscopic model related to the topological entanglement entropy .",
    "a system with a mass gap in two spatial dimensions can exhibit topological order @xcite .",
    "a mass gap is the key ingredient for the incompressible quantum hall state @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations in the quantum hall system obey fractional statistics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , haldane @xcite showed that , in the quantum hall system , the ground - state degeneracy depends on whether the geometry is either sphere or torus .",
    "these features of mass gap , fractional statistics , and dependence of degeneracy are all topological properties .",
    "hence it is natural to consider the topological entanglement entropy in the quantum hall system .    for applications of the topological entanglement entropy in relation with quantum phase transitions , we consider bilayer quantum hall systems , where it is simpler to introduce controllable parameters into the hamiltonian of the system . in bilayer quantum hall systems , two parameters to be controlled are the layer separation @xmath0 and the inter - layer tunneling amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "the experimental strong evidence for the quantum phase transition of bilayer systems was a strong enhancement in the zero - bias inter - layer tunneling conductance for a small @xmath0 system at total landau level filling factor @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "theoretically , if @xmath0 goes to @xmath3 for fixed @xmath4 , the bilayer system becomes a set of two single layer systems for @xmath5 . for a large @xmath0 system",
    ", the ground state would be compressible , which is not a quantum hall state .",
    "it is clear that phase transition takes place at the critical value @xmath6 which is met while @xmath0 changes from @xmath7 to @xmath3 .",
    "the main concern is now to draw the phase diagram of the system in the parameter space of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "pseudospin notation for the layer degree of freedom is used to find the phase diagram , by calculating the pseudospin magnetization @xcite .",
    "however this pseudospin magnetization approach is not conclusive because calculations of varying @xmath0 for fixed @xmath1 give different results from those of varying @xmath1 for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "since the pseudospin is a local order parameter , the approach of the pseudospin magnetization may not provide perfect explanation for the nature of quantum phase transitions in bilayer quantum hall systems .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the topological entanglement entropy , which is the most natural order parameter to study phase transition in bilayer quantum hall systems . using exact diagonalization",
    ", we numerically evaluate the topological entanglement entropy in finite size systems .",
    "we analyze the behavior of the topological entanglement entropy as we vary @xmath0 for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "we also carry out the analysis of finite size scaling .",
    "we will show that the topological entanglement entropy provides a different phase boundary from that of the pseudospin magnetization in bilayer quantum hall systems .",
    "this difference is controversial .",
    "more detailed experimental measurements are required to resolve the issue of topological entanglement entropy as an order parameter for bilayer quantum hall systems .",
    "we start with presenting the bilayer quantum hall system in terms of the second quantized form of the hamiltonian in a torus geometry within the lowest landau level approximation .",

    "it is convenient to measure all distances in the unit of @xmath13 , and energies in the unit of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a dielectric constant .",
    "the two - body interaction between electrons is described by the periodic coulomb interaction @xmath16 , which is written in terms of position variables @xmath17 and momentum variables @xmath18 by using the fourier transformation : @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is introduced in order to take into account the infrared divergence .",
    "if two electrons are on the same ( different ) layer , intra ( inter ) layer , the third component of @xmath21 is @xmath7 ( @xmath0 ) . in the torus geometry of the finite size @xmath22 , the first and second components @xmath23 and @xmath24 out of @xmath18 turn to the discrete integers @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while @xmath27 is kept as continuous .",
    "then @xmath16 between inter - layer electrons is written as @xmath28 } { ( \\frac{2\\pi}{l}n_{1})^{2}+(\\frac{2\\pi}{l}n_{2})^{2}+k^{2}_{3 } } \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is extracted as the infrared divergence part for the case of @xmath29 . integrating out @xmath30",

    "the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where pseudospin @xmath44 or @xmath45 is used to describe different layers .",

    "all electrons stay in a single layer according to hund s rule for a small @xmath0 as shown in table [ tab : tab1 ] .    following the procedure given by yoshioka - halperin - lee @xcite , we find @xmath55 here the orbital index @xmath34 in @xmath42 should satisfy the periodic condition such that @xmath56 .",

    "we drew the phase boundary by plotting the maxima of the first - derivatives with respect to @xmath0 in fig .",
    "4 . the phase boundary has a slight increasing tendency as the tunneling amplitude increases .",

    "_ @xcite . however , the parabolic phase boundary has a little discrepancy @xcite with the tunneling data as shown in fig .",
    "5 . in fact",
    ", the critical value @xmath78 at @xmath65 determined by the tunneling data is less than the value given by the parabolic phase boundary line .",
    "another point of the parabolic phase boundary is that there always exists an enough big tunneling amplitude @xmath1 that produces a quantum hall state for any @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the tunneling can produce a quantum hall state without the inter - layer coulomb interaction for infinitely separated bilayer systems .",
    "this dominant role of tunneling may be overestimated to produce a quantum hall state . in order to explain the transport data and the tunneling data simultaneously ,",
    "we modify the phase boundary line which is concave as shown in fig .",
