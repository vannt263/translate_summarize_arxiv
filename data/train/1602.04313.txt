    "with in plane incoming and out - going photon polarizations one can access three distinct irreducible representations of the d@xmath8 point group : a@xmath60 , a@xmath61 and e@xmath61 .",

    "the knowledge of these tensors allows to compute the raman intensity associated to each representation @xmath69 for a given set of out going and incoming photon polarizations @xmath70 , @xmath71 :    @xmath72    using the above equation , one can easily show that for parallel polarizations : @xmath73 while for cross polarizations : @xmath74",
    "the non - resonant ers intensity is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the electronic raman response @xmath75 , which for weakly correlated systems can be written in terms of an effective density - density correlation function @xcite .",
    "@xmath76 @xmath77 is the transferred wave - vector and @xmath78 the bose - einstein distribution whose effect is vanishingly small for @xmath79 and will be neglected hereafter .",
    "the raman response function @xmath80 measures an effective density @xmath81 which is given by    @xmath82    @xmath83 is the raman scattering amplitude or raman vertex whose symmetry @xmath69 is determined by the polarizations @xmath84 and @xmath85 of the incoming and out - going photons as discussed above .",
    "the raman vertex @xmath38 contains information on the two - photon interaction responsible for the raman processes . for ers",
    "these processes arise from ( i ) direct contact interaction processes and ( ii ) two - step processes involving virtual or real intermediate states .",
    "we note that if we replace the raman vertex by a constant , the raman response function is simply given by the dynamical polarizability @xmath86 : the standard lindhard function for non - interacting electrons @xcite .",
    "the interaction of matter with light occurs via coupling of the radiation field represented by the vector potential * a * to an electron with momentum @xmath87 .",
    "this interaction can be computed using the peierls substitution @xmath88 and gives two contributions to the light matter interaction hamiltonian : @xmath89 @xmath90    the electronic raman cross - section corresponds to two photon processes .",
    "its vertex can be computed by treating @xmath91 to first order perturbation theory and @xmath92 to second order perturbation theory .",
    "noting @xmath93 and @xmath94 the unit vectors of the in - going and out - going vector potentials @xmath95 , the general formula of the raman vertex for non - interacting bloch electrons can be written as ( see for e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the initial , intermediate and final bloch electron states with energies @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "these represents the lowest order ers processes .",
    "higher order processes involving coulomb interaction matrix element can also contribute .",
    "however they will typically give raise to a featureless continuum with a very weak dependence on the gate voltage @xcite .",
    "we therefore do not consider them here .",
    "to lowest order the raman vertex [ vertex ] contains two types of contributions depicted in the feynman diagrams shown in figure [ ers - process ] :    1 .",
    "the first term is a direct contact term in @xmath100 where the inelastic process occurs in a single step of light matter interaction ( two photon scattering ) .",
    "this term is never resonant .",
    "the last two terms in * p*.*a * corresponds to two - step processes : a photon emission ( absorption ) followed by a photon absorption ( emission ) .",
    "note that the intermediate electronic state @xmath98 does not have to satisfy energy conservation and only wave - vector should be conserved ( i.e. transitions are almost vertical ) .",
    "the sum is therefore over all the electronic states of the crystals which satisfy momentum conservation .",
    "the intermediate state can either virtual , ( non - resonant process ) , or real , ( resonant process ) . in the resonant case",
    "the incident photon energy matches an interband transition : @xmath101 and the vertex diverges .",
    "when finite lifetime effects are included the divergence will be replaced by a strong enhancement .",
    "this enhancement is observed for example in semiconductor heterostructures when the incoming photon energy is tuned close to the fundamental gap energy of the semiconductor host . in the case of graphene ,",
    "raman processes involving interband electron - hole excitations across the dirac cone can only be resonant if the fermi energy @xmath19 is on the order of the incoming photon energy @xmath13 . in typical raman experiment",
    "the incoming photon energy is in the near - infrared - visible range ( 1.5 - 3ev ) so that @xmath102 and resonant interband electron - hole excitation processes can not occur .",
    "this is because both wave - vector conservation and the resonance condition on the intermediate state energy can not be met simultaneously .",
    "this leaves non - resonant terms involving either contact interaction or two - step processes involving virtual intermediate states as the only possible processes . we note that higher order ers processes do not have this restriction , and will be in general resonant @xcite .",
    "they may contribute to the gate and symmetry independent continuum observed in our experiments .        for non - resonant raman scattering",
    "it is customary to compute the raman vertex using the effective mass approximation . in the case of graphene",
    "however , the effective mass approximation gives vanishing raman amplitude because of the linear electronic dispersion .",
    "instead the contact and two - step processes terms have to be calculated explicitly .",
    "this calculation was performed by kashuba et al .",
    "@xcite and , for interband electron - hole excitations they found a k - independent raman vertex dominated by non - resonant two - step processes . because of the chirality of the electronic bands of graphene , its leading term has @xmath1 symmetry and therefore breaks time - reversal symmetry .",

    "we notice that for t=30  k the effect of temperature is barely noticeable with respect to t=0  k calculations .",
    "temperature effects alone thus can not explain the broadening of the 2@xmath19 suppression seen experimentally at 30  k. they are however more significant at 300  k.",
    "we now take into account electron lifetimes effects more explicitly by considering the full expression for the electron spectral function including self - energy effects .",
    "in particular we explore the effect of disorder which will result in a finite frequency independent scattering rate @xmath50 which is given by the imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath112 : @xmath126 .",
    "we note that electron - electron interaction can also bring additional frequency dependent contributions to the self - energy .",
    "we do not consider them here but they might important for cleaner graphene samples like suspended ones , where the impact of disorder is reduced .    in order to proceed",
    "we need an estimate of the electron scattering rate . within a drude model ,",
    "the typical mobilities of supported graphene sample suggest a impurity induced scattering rate @xmath127  100 @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this value is confirmed by thz measurements of the drude response in cvd graphene samples @xcite .",
    "this value was therefore used and inserted in the electron spectral functions which are now lorentzian with a line - width given by @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding ers intensity and ratio @xmath25 were numerically computed and are shown for different values of the fermi energy @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig2si ] .",
    "the broadening of the 2@xmath19 suppression is still insufficient to account for the data hinting that inhomogeneous broadening due to non - uniform carrier density is the most dominant broadening mechanism in our sample .",
    "we note that the inclusion of finite lifetime effects will also release the kinematic constraint on intra - band processes @xmath128 . for finite chemical potential",
    "it will yield a drude - like contribution to @xmath75 at low energy , @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "we did not find any evidence for this contribution in our raman data for @xmath13080  @xmath16 , but this contribution could be masked by the signal coming from the doped si substrate .",
    "in the main text , the dirac voltage is determined from the well - known gate - dependent evolution of the g - band energy and line - width .",
    "this determination can be cross - checked with the ers continuum at 1580 @xmath16 which follows the evolution of the g band line - width . in figure [ fig3si ]",
    "we show the spectra of the g band , recorded at multiple gate voltages .",
    "they were performed on the same spot as the continuum data reported in the main text , but with a higher resolution using a 1800 grooves / mm grating .",
    "we fitted these spectra with lorentzian profiles in order to extract the energy and line - width which are shown in figure [ fig3si](c ) .",

    "[ fig3si](d ) , the evolution of the g band energy and line - width with fermi energy can also be well reproduced theoretically by the well - known expressions for the g - band renormalization by interband electron - hole excitations @xcite        in figure 3 of the main text , the intensity of the ers continuum at @xmath132 is plotted as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "it was determined using a lower resolution ( 600 groove / mm ) in order to increase the photon counts on the continuum .",
    "this gave rise to a resolution limited line - shape for the g - band phonon ( fig [ fig4si](a ) ) .",
    "the g band was fitted with a voigt profile together with an additional constant @xmath133 which describe the total continuum background ( fig [ fig4si](b ) ) ( for some gate voltages a additional linear in @xmath12 term was added to account for the continuum close to @xmath132 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath133 is equal to the ers intensity at @xmath132 up to a gate independent background @xmath28 : @xmath133=i@xmath134(@xmath132)+@xmath28 .",
    "@xmath28 was then identified as the value of @xmath133 far away from the dirac voltage and subtracted in order to obtain the gate dependence of i@xmath134(@xmath132 ) shown on the main text ( fig .",
    "as we can see in fig .",
    "2(b ) of the main text , after the introduction of the fermi level broadening , the value of 2@xmath19 does not correspond to a clear onset of the suppression of the signal as in the clean homogeneous case at t=0k .",

    "the smaller capacitance due to the increased thickness of the dielectric was compensated by the fact that the insulating layer was more resistive , which allowed us to achieve higher gate voltage values .",
    "figure [ fig5si ] ( a ) shows cross - polarization spectra recorded at different gate voltages in the same experimental conditions ( except the temperature ) as the data in the first device presented in the main text . we can notice a background of similar overall intensity but with a slightly different shape with respect to the device shown in fig 1(b ) of the main text",

    "we note that the overall shape of the background is also be controlled by interference conditions associated to sio@xmath2 thicknesses ( 280  nm for the first device versus 500  nm for the second ) , and by the optical alignment which could be slightly different between the two experiments .. nonetheless the gate effect on the continuum is clearly observed in this device and , more importantly , the ratio @xmath25 shown in fig [ fig5si ] ( c ) can also be very well reproduced by the theoretical expectations using the estimated capacitance of the device @xmath141 , t=293  k and the same distribution of fermi energy as the first device .",

    "<S> while all these corrections can in principle be estimated and corrected for , we choose a simpler way to extract informations on the spectral dependance of @xmath18 as a function of gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the raw spectra can be normalized with the one taken at the dirac voltage @xmath30 , i(@xmath31 ) , defined as the gate voltage at which the fermi level is at the dirac ( or charge neutrality ) point : @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we can define the ratio @xmath25    @xmath33    which is independent from @xmath34 and thus free from instrumental artifacts . </S>",
    "<S> as pristine graphene samples are generally doped by residual impurities and/or contaminants , the dirac voltage was estimated by following the evolution of the g - band frequency with the gate voltage @xcite , yielding @xmath30=20  v @xcite .    for clarity , </S>",
    "<S> the optical phonons were first subtracted from the raw spectra , at each gate voltage , using voigt profiles . </S>",
    "<S> this could however only be done reliably above  1100 @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> below 1100  @xmath16 the phonon contributions coming from the si substrate were found to be too broad and intense to allow for an unambiguous extraction of the small gate - induced changes in the continuum underneath . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phonon - free continua above 1100  @xmath16 were then divided by the spectrum at the dirac voltage in order to obtain @xmath35 which is plotted in figure [ fig:2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the gate voltage deviates from the dirac voltage , @xmath25 is increasingly suppressed and the onset of suppression moves progressively to higher energies , reaching @xmath3 4000  @xmath16 for @xmath15=-40  v. the behavior of @xmath25 bears a striking similarity with gate dependent optical conductivity data performed on similar devices @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now compare the experimental data with the theoretical expectations of the ers intensity in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> to lowest order , the non - interacting ers intensity arising from vertical electron - hole interband excitations in graphene reads @xcite @xcite    @xmath36 \\label{eqn : fd}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37^{-1}$ ] is the fermi - dirac distribution . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is the raman vertex which describes the electron - photon interaction process and depends on the in - coming and out - going photon polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> in general both direct contact processes and two - step processes involving a virtual excitation can contribute to ers intensity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown by kashuba et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in the case of graphene and for excitation photon energies in the visible range , non - resonant two - step processes are the dominant ones for interband electron - hole excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with conventional two - dimensional electron gas in semiconductor heterostructures , where ers is generally studied in the resonant regime , with incident photon energies @xmath13 tuned close to the fundamental gap of the semiconductor @xcite . in graphene </S>",
    "<S> the associated non - resonant raman vertex has @xmath1 symmetry @xcite : it is non - zero only for cross linear photon polarizations in agreement with our experimental data . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](b ) , at the dirac point the theoretical ers intensity has a linear in frequency spectral dependence , while away from the dirac point it displays a threshold at 2@xmath19 due to pauli - blocking . </S>",
    "<S> except for the linear in frequency term , the ers frequency dependence is very similar to the optical conductivity and the approximate relation @xmath39 holds for graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as typical graphene samples display inhomogeneous carrier doping , spatial fluctuations of the fermi energy were also considered and assumed to follow a gaussian distribution function ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](b ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to compare with the experimental data , a theoretical @xmath25 was calculated by dividing each theoretical spectra by the one at the dirac voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energies were chosen assuming the standard relationship between the gate voltage and the density : @xmath40 with @xmath41 , using the calculated geometrical capacitance of the device ( @xmath42/@xmath43 ) and a fermi velocity @xmath44=10@xmath45  ms@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results are superimposed on the experimental data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) for several gate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between theory and experiments is remarkable given that the only free parameter is the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution of fermi energy . in our case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 50  mev gave the best fits to the data . </S>",
    "<S> this value is consistent with previous estimations for supported graphene samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note however that others parameters , such as the finite electron lifetimes , can also contribute to the observed broadening of the 2@xmath19 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we thus consider this value of @xmath47 as an upper limit @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](d ) we show that the fermi energy can also be reliably obtained directly from the @xmath25 data by identifying the inflection point of the spectra ( shown with an arrow in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) ) with 2@xmath19 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( red dots ) and of the g band change in linewidth @xmath48=@xmath49-@xmath50 ( black dots ) as a function of the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 is the observed linewidth and @xmath50 a gate voltage independent contribution to the linewidth arising from lattice anharmonicity and disorder effects . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line is the theoretical expectation for @xmath51 after a convolution with a gaussian distribution of fermi energy with @xmath52 50   mev . </S>",
    "<S> the insets show feynman diagrams for the ers intensity ( red ) and electron - phonon induced g - band renormalization ( black ) . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite for details about the ers vertex . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is illuminating to draw a parallel between the observed gate dependent ers continuum and the well - known behavior of the g - band linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , apart from the raman vertex pre - factor , the frequency dependence of the ers intensity is essentially given by the imaginary part of the electron - polarizability of graphene , @xmath53 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , as first noted by ando @xcite , and observed experimentally @xcite , due to electron - phonon coupling the g - band linewidth @xmath49 contains a contribution , @xmath54 , which arises from landau damping by electron - hole excitations processes and is given by the imaginary part of the electron - polarizability at the phonon frequency : @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference between ers and g - band renormalization processes is the vertices involved : the raman vertex @xmath38 and the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath56 respectively ( see inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gate dependence of the g - band linewidth is thus directly proportional to the intensity of the ers continuum at the phonon frequency :    @xmath57    figure [ fig:3 ] displays the gate voltage dependence of the ers continuum taken at the g band frequency @xmath58 and the change in linewidth of the g - band @xmath48 , measured on the same spot but with a higher resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the overall agreement between both quantities provides a direct evidence of their common link to the electron - polarizability of graphene and gives an unified picture of both effects .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we have observed gate dependent ers signal from a single - layer graphene device . the gate voltage and light polarizations dependences of the signal are fully consistent with interband electron - hole excitations created by a non - resonant raman process . while raman scattering in carbon - based materials has been traditionally confined to the study of optical phonons </S>",
    "<S> , our work demonstrates the ability of raman scattering in exploring electronic excitations of 2d materials even far away from resonance . </S>",
    "<S> it paves the way for promising future studies of interaction induced effects in cleaner devices , which have remained hitherto inaccessible to most spectroscopies .    </S>",
