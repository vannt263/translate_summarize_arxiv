    "supernovae ( sne ) are classified into several commonly - recognized categories on the basis of features in their optical spectra .",
    "these categories  the sn types ia , ib , ic , and ii  are not merely phenomenological distinctions , but reflect real differences in the nature of the progenitor and the subsequent explosion ( for a recent review , see filippenko 1997 ) .    as understanding of the nature of these differences has grown  and moreover , as the number of supernova discoveries has increased to more than 100 per year ",
    "the sn follow - up community has become increasingly specialized .",
    "type  ia sne have proven to be useful standard candles for cosmography ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ; riess et al .  1998 ; tonry et al .  2003 ; knop et al .  2003 ; riess et al .",
    "2004 ) , and provided the first strong evidence for a cosmological constant or quintessence .",
    "three type  ic supernovae have been found in association with gamma - ray bursts ( sn1998bw : galama et al .",
    "1998 ; sn2003dh : stanek et al .  2003",
    "; hjorth et al .  2003 ; matheson et al .",

    "2004b ) , and indeed ,",
    "type ib and ic supernovae provide the most likely population of `` collapsar '' events ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "finally , interest in type  ii events has been focused by the type  ii sn1987a and its associated neutrino burst ( arnett et al .",
    "1989 and references therein ) , which provided the first direct observation of core collapse .",
    "type  ii sne may also prove to be useful distance indicators , if indications that their plateau - phase luminosities and expansion velocities are strongly correlated ( hamuy & pinto 2002 ) prove to be correct .    given the diversity of causes towards which sn observations may be applied  and the various strategies employed by groups that study sne  it follows that the efficiency of follow - up observations for any sn is dependent on the rapid identification of its type . these types",
    "are ultimately determined by analysis of the optical spectra .",
    "however , spectroscopy time remains a somewhat precious commodity , and there is often a significant time delay , of days to weeks , before a sn can be properly typed in this fashion .",
    "in two recent papers , poznanski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and gal - yam et al.(2004a ) have presented the outline of an alternative approach that can provide a probabilistic estimate of the type of newly - discovered , young supernovae using multi - color photometry . with the proper facilities this approach",
    "could be implemented on a rapid basis following the discovery of each new sn .",
    "depending on the quality of the data obtained , and assuming the supernova spectra used to develop their test are sufficiently generic , the type of the sn can be determined in this way with a high degree of confidence before any spectra are taken .    the poznanski - gal - yam method ( hereafter `` pgm '' )",
    "makes use of three- or four - filter photometry of the supernova , with the several magnitudes applied to calculate two colors for the object .",
    "the location of the object in this two - color space is then compared to the locations of supernovae of various types and ages by reference to an extensive spectroscopic library .",
    "since pgm works from the basis of flux - calibrated optical ( and to an extent , uv and near - ir ) spectra , the specific choice of filters and acceptable range of sn redshifts is not constrained a priori .",
    "in fact , poznanski and gal - yam have implemented the method via an interactive web page , their `` typing machine , '' which accepts input of an arbitrary set of sloan or johnson - cousins filters . as gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2004a ) have pointed out , the similar spectra of all young supernovae at redder wavelengths ( @xmath0 ) means that classification of low - redshift events is best done with measurements in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 filters .",
    "when the redshift of the supernova is known  typically , because the sn has been found in association with a catalogued local galaxy  the only remaining unknown is the quantity of extinction in the sn host galaxy .",
    "this parameter can not be directly estimated from the photometric data ; instead , an `` arrow '' in the two - color space shows the color correction that would account for one magnitude of extinction ( @xmath5  mag ) in the host .",
    "since this is more or less the greatest extinction we expect to observe for supernovae discovered in unfiltered optical searches , this provides a reasonable indication of the associated systematic uncertainty .    the first application of pgm photo - typing by poznanski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) evaluated the likely type of a supernova discovered during the course of the sloan digital sky survey , sn2001fg , which had its redshift and type determined by follow - up keck spectroscopy ( filippenko & chornock 2001 ) .",
    "although the photometric analysis ( based on the sloan discovery photometry ; vanden berk et al .  2001 ) suggested a @xmath61month - old type  ia identification for the event , in accord with the spectroscopy , this conclusion used the redshift of the event as derived from the keck data .",
    "thus it was more suggestive than diagnostic of the utility of the pgm .",
    "we are therefore interested in making the first observational tests of pgm photo - typing , by obtaining four - filter imaging of young , low - redshift supernovae .",
    "we are in a unique position to perform these tests , having recently completed the roboticization of the palomar 60-inch ( 1.5-m ) telescope ( p60 ) .",
    "approximately 80% of the observing time on p60 is devoted to transient astronomy , and in the absence of high - priority campaigns we are able to obtain images of new sne quickly , within a day or two of the sn discovery .",
    "indeed , in the 2004b semester we have begun a palomar large program , the `` caltech core collapse program '' ( cccp ; gal - yam et al .",
    "2004c ) to monitor the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of a complete sample of low - redshift core - collapse sne over the course of a year .",
    "early - time sn photo - typing observations make a natural supplement to these extended cccp photometric campaigns .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review our procedure for performing accurate photometry on the supernovae .",
    "section 3 presents our observations and data reduction and analysis . in section 4 , we photo - type our three target sne , sn2004cs , sn2004dh , and sn2004dk . in section 5",
    ", we present our spectroscopic observations of sn2004cs , demonstrating its unusual type  ii nature , and reflect on the erroneous photo - typing result for this event .",
    "section 6 presents our conclusions and discusses future prospects for this work .",
    "accurate photometry of a newly - discovered supernova presents at least two challenges .",
    "first , the sn will be superposed on some unknown quantity of background light due to its host galaxy ; and second , the immediate field of the sn will have to be photometrically calibrated . moreover , if a quick turn - around is desired , this calibration will generally have to be carried out in less than ideal conditions .",
    "we address the first of these issues by performing point - spread function photometry on the sn and on several reference ( psf ) stars , using the daophot package ( stetson 1987 , 1990 ) in the iraf environment .",
    "although this will fail to account for any point - like component of the host galaxy light ( e.g. , a compact underlying hii region ) , such contamination can not be avoided without reference pre- or post - supernova imaging ; moreover , since we are studying low - redshift events in resolved galaxies , the strength of such contamination is not expected to be severe .",
    "if the night is ( close to ) photometric , standard fields are analyzed with the stetson photometric catalog , using the photcal package in iraf to derive the photometric transformation equations for the night , and apply these equations to the aperture magnitudes of the psf stars in the sn field .",
    "the resulting `` true '' magnitudes of the psf stars are then compared to their psf magnitudes to derive the psf - to - aperture zero - point shift to apply to the supernova psf magnitudes .",
    "if the night is not sufficiently photometric , we retain the photo - typing observation sequence in the p60 queue for roughly a week , and use the best available night for our analysis .",
    "in general , we aim to perform our analysis of each supernova promptly . as such",
    ", we sacrifice some accuracy in attempting to calibrate the images on the same night as the observations whenever possible instead of waiting for a photometric night ( which are rare at palomar ) .",
    "we examine the coefficients of the transformation equations produced by the standard fields to determine if the night is photometric . if these parameters are unreasonable ( implying , for example , that stars are appearing brighter at increased airmass ) , some subset of the standard observations may be dropped .",
    "to force reasonable coefficients , the airmass term can be dropped from the fit entirely and only standards taken at an airmass similar to the target field s used to calculate the photometric and color shifts . to control for associated systematic effects ",
    "e.g.  clouds  we can observe the sn target field twice during the night . this does not add much time to the run , but allows the full analysis to be performed twice on quasi - independent sets of data . if consistent answers can not be obtained for the magnitudes of the reference stars across the two observations , we may find that we can derive consistent answers for their colors ( i.e. , to the extent that we are subject to varying levels of approximately gray extinction ) .",
    "this introduces an uncontrolled systematic error , in that it assumes the sn is similar enough in color to our reference stars that atmospheric and extinction effects are comparable ; however , it does at least allow for a photo - typing measurement to be made .",
    "the stetson standard fields are not calibrated in the @xmath2 band ; we calculate @xmath2-band magnitudes for stars in the standard fields from their @xmath1 and @xmath3 magnitudes using the transformation equations of smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    to check the accuracy of the photometric errors estimated by iraf ,",
    "the calculated magnitudes of the reference stars from two independent data - sets are then compared .",
    "ideally , the second data - set is taken on the same night , but it can also come from a different night with a distinct set of transformation equations .",
    "a chi - squared comparison can then be made to reject outliers and estimate the factor by which to inflate the iraf errors to get a reduced @xmath7 value of one .",
    "we have found that this is generally necessary since iraf tends to quote errors that are too small , partly because they are derived from an idealized model , and partly because the entire photometric calibration process presumes ideal photometric conditions . separately , at these beginning stages of the p60",
    "our observations were subject to significant seeing variations over the course of the night ; the seeing at p60 tending to be poor at the beginning of the night , then improving and stabilizing by midnight .",
    "a similar @xmath7 check is done for the calculated aperture - to - psf zero - point shifts , on a star - by - star basis .",
    "the derived multiplicative factors required to make the iraf - quoted errors acceptable are then applied to the sn errors .",
    "while one goal of this project is to create as automated a process as possible , a minimal amount of human interaction helps to ensure robust and repeatable results .",
    "first , it is advisable to have a human selecting or reviewing the reference stars selected in the sn field ; this does not take much time but is more reliable than iraf s selection methods , which occasionally select saturated stars , stars near bad pixels , cosmic rays , or non - isolated stars .",
    "additionally , constructing photometric calibrations for non - photometric nights can lead to variations which make it difficult to trust a single blind fit of the transformation equations .",
    "indeed , the three - step process of progressively more conservative ( and less precise ) approaches to photometric calibration that we describe above can probably only be carried out in an interactive fashion , although an automated pipeline could take the alternative approach of carrying out all three approaches in parallel ( later allowing human interaction to select the best of the three ) .",
    "we selected candidates that were discovered at a provably young age and were observable from palomar observatory .",
    "the target supernovae were observed by p60 on the first available night in @xmath8 or @xmath9 ( table  [ tab : mags ] ) .",
    "all of our images were taken with the new camera at p60 , which is a two - amplifier , 2048@xmath102048 site ccd with a 12.9  field of view at cassegrain focus .",
    "readout ( 25  s for the full chip in single - pixel binning mode ) is accomplished by a two - channel leach iii controller card ; details of the new camera and robotic observing system will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "data were overscan - subtracted , demosaicked , bias - subtracted , flat - fielded ( using dome flats taken the preceding afternoon ) , bad pixel - masked , and had a blind - pointing world coordinate system ( wcs ) applied by the p60 image analysis pipeline .",
    "we refined this wcs by referencing digitized sky survey images of the field .",

    "<S> we present photometric typing analyses of three young supernovae observed with the robotic 60-inch telescope at palomar observatory ( p60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this represents the first time that such photo - typing has been attempted , in a blind fashion , on newly - discovered supernovae . for one of the target supernovae , sn2004cs , </S>",
    "<S> our photometry provided the first constraint on the sn type , which we predicted would be type  ia . to the contrary , however , our subsequent keck spectroscopy shows it to be an unusual type  ii supernova . </S>",
    "<S> for each of the other two supernovae , sn2004dh ( type  ii ) and sn2004dk ( type  ib ) , our photo - typing results are consistent with the known type of the event as determined from ground - based spectroscopy ; however , the colors of sn2004dk are also consistent with a type  ic or type  ii classification . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our approach to the challenges of photo - typing  </S>",
    "<S> contamination by host galaxy light and the unknown photometric quality of the data  in the case where it is desirable to complete the analysis with just one night of observations . </S>",
    "<S> the growing interest in the properties and behavior of very young supernovae , and the increased discovery rate for such events , mean that prompt photo - typing analyses can provide useful input to observational campaigns . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate the value and feasibility of such a project for p60 , at the same time illustrating its chief inherent shortcoming : an inability to identify new and unusual events as such without later spectroscopic observations . </S>"
