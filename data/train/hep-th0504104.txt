    "understanding the underlying structure of space and time poses continuous challenges .",
    "it is hence interesting to study possible deformations of ordinary space - time which are mathematically under control .",
    "supersymmetric theories provide a natural laboratory to explore new ideas .",
    "of particular current interest are the non(anti)commutative deformed versions of the @xmath2 superspace @xcite according to which one requires the grassmanian variables of the ordinary superspace @xmath3 to satisfy the following anticommutator relation : @xmath4 since the @xmath5 variables are taken to anticommute a clifford deformation @xcite of the superspace must be performed in the euclidean space .",
    "here the @xmath6 and @xmath5 are independent @xcite .",
    "this also implies that only half of the original supersymmetry is kept intact @xcite .",
    "another interesting point is that these theories naturally emerge as an effective low energy description of certain superstring theories in constant graviphoton backgrounds @xcite .",
    "this is however not an entirely new subject .",
    "seiberg has shown that the noncommutative deformation of the wess - zumino model and of @xmath7 super yang - mills theories results in the addition of a finite number of higher dimensional operators with respect to the undeformed lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the deformed theories preserve locality , lorentz symmetry and are renormalizable @xcite .",
    "the study of instantons @xcite in this framework has also been a subject of much interest as well as the lower dimensional cousin theories .",
    "another interesting application of the deformed superspace used to analyze spectral properties in supersymmetric gluondynamics and one - flavor qcd has been proposed in @xcite .    here",
    "we construct the component form of the most general chiral model theory with an arbitrary number of chiral superfields in the deformed superspace theory in four dimensions .",
    "this generalizes the work in @xcite and @xcite which focussed on a single chiral superfield . due to the fact that the product of chiral superfields does not commute in the deformed superspace one must use an ordering procedure which renders the generalization to an arbitrary number of fields quite involved .",
    "we elucidate some issues related to how to handle the khler of the theory .",
    "more precisely we show that certain lagrangian terms , present in @xcite , are actually absent when considering the fully symmetrized deformed khler of the theory with respect to both chiral and antichiral superfields simultaneously .",
    "we recall that supersymmetric chiral models with an arbitrary number of fields are relevant since they have been used , for example , to investigate the vacuum structure of supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite . besides many models of spontaneously broken supersymmetry involve more than one field and/or nonperturbatively induced superpotentials .",
    "having determined the general chiral model for @xmath8 with an arbitrary number of superfields allows immediately to investigate the deformations of a number of low energy superpotentials derived in the standard supersymmetric case .",
    "we then propose an instructive toy model in which the potential of the theory at the component level , and after having integrated out the auxiliary field , contains an infinite number of terms .",
    "interestingly the full series in the deformation parameter can be summed .",
    "another amusing property of the final potential is that it is a function only of the product of the scalar and the antiscalar field . in the euclidean space",
    "the antiscalar field is not merely the complex conjugated of the scalar field .",
    "although we are forced , by the very definition of the deformed superspace , to be in the euclidean space the structure of the potential is so intriguing to us that we have been tempted to analytically continue it in the minkowski space .",
    "if the determinant of the deformation parameter is assumed real then also the potential is real and positive .",
    "one can show that the vacuum structure of the theory is unchanged with respect to the undeformed space while the potential is largely affected in the infrared , i.e. for small values of the bosonic field values .",
    "it naturally introduces a new maximum with a finite value of the potential while the theory still preserves lorentz symmetry @xcite .",
    "the presence of two scales , i.e. the one associated to the deformation parameter , which may be linked to the gravity scale , together with another , possibly dynamically generated , scale as well as the fact that the potential is very flat at large values of the bosonic field suggests that the effective theory explored here and more generally theories emerging from the deformed superspace @xcite when coupled to gravity might be of some interest for models of inflation @xcite .",
    "again we stress that we are not really entitled to continue the theory in the minkowski space and our example is just meant to be a primitive attempt in the quest for possible physical applications .",
    "there are however already interesting attempts @xcite to define superspace deformations directly in the minkowski space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section two we briefly review the basic properties defining the noncommuting @xmath0 superspace . in section three",
    "we investigate the product of a generic number of ( anti)chiral superfields in the deformed space . in the fourth section",
    "we extend the generic supersymmetric chiral sigma model to the deformed superspace while providing a number of useful relations . in section five",
    "we summarize the result for the generic deformed superfield expressed in terms of the component fields . in this section",
    "we also confront our lagrangian with previous results already present in the literature ( only for a single field ) and show how differences emerge .",
    "in section six we rewrite the full lagrangian in a compact form .",
    "in section seven and using a simple khler we compute the potential of the theory after having integrated out the auxiliary fields .",
    "the potential is , in general , a series in the deformation parameter of the superspace and is , in general , complex .",
    "we then present an example and indicate possible physical applications .",
    "section eight is dedicated to the conclusions .",
    "three appendices are dedicated either to relevant examples or lengthy but detailed computations useful for the interested reader to better understand our results .",
    "our starting point will be the deformation of ordinary @xmath10 superspace by requiring @xmath3 to satisfy the following anticommutator relation : @xmath11 the first implications of such an extension were investigated in @xcite .",
    "the deformation requires an ordering definition for the functions of @xmath6 .",
    "weyl ordering seems to be a natural choice @xcite . in this way",
    "every expression containing @xmath6 has to be ordered .",
    "this can be achieved , following ordinary noncommutative geometry , by introducing the star product : @xmath12    for the remaining coordinates a simple consistent choice of the ( anti)commuting relations is @xcite :    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15 = [ y^{\\mu},{\\theta}^{\\alpha } ] =      [ y^{\\mu},{\\overline{\\theta}}^{\\dot{\\alpha}}]=0 \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the chiral coordinate .",
    "one can imagine various generalizations of this superspace which will not be considered here .",
    "several remarks are in order . since the @xmath17 s are taken to anticommute it is clear that they can not be the complex conjugate of @xmath6 .",
    "we therefore have to be in the euclidean space where the lorentz group becomes @xmath18 .",
    "we will however keep the lorentz notation . according to @xcite the chiral coordinates @xmath19",
    "is assumed to commute .",
    "consistency then requires the ordinary spacetime coordinates @xmath20 not to commute .",
    "in fact , using the relations :    @xmath21    @xmath22    we obtain : @xmath23=\\overline{\\theta}\\overline{\\theta}c^{\\mu\\nu } \\ .\\ ] ] the reason for _ not _ assuming the ordinary spacetime coordinates @xmath20 to commute is that it makes it hard to define chiral superfields .",
    "recall that a chiral superfield @xmath24 is defined through the standard constraint @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the covariant derivative . in the @xmath20",
    "coordinates @xmath26 also depends on @xmath6 and therefore , in the deformed superspace , it does not act as an ordinary derivative , i.e. it does not satisfy the leibniz rule . in the chiral",
    "coordinates @xmath19 on the contrary , @xmath27 does not depend explicitly on @xmath6 and therefore acts as an ordinary derivative .",
    "so the deformed superspace is best parameterized by the following set of coordinates @xmath28 satisfying the algebra ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "the deformed superspace we refer to as the noncommutative space .",
    "it is clear that for vanishing @xmath29 this becomes the commutative space .",
    "any function defined on the noncommutative space is understood in terms of its taylor expansion but with every product replaced by the star product .",
    "the latter breaks half of the supersymmetry but preserves chirality , i.e. the star product of two ( anti)chiral superfields is again a ( anti)chiral superfield .",
    "it is convenient for the reader to review the expressions for the covariant derivatives @xmath30 , @xmath26 and the supercharges @xmath31 , @xmath32 in the standard way :    @xmath33    note that @xmath32 depends explicitly on @xmath6 .",
    "hence while all of the anticommutation relations are as in the commutative space we have for the @xmath34 :    @xmath35    this shows that the deformed superspace is generated by the supercharge @xmath36 and that the star product is invariant under @xmath36 .",
    "however since @xmath34 contains a @xmath6 the star product is not invariant under @xmath34 .",
    "so only transformations induced by @xmath36 are still intact symmetries while the ones induced by @xmath34 are broken .",
    "for this reason the deformed superspace has been termed @xmath9 superspace .",
    "since chirality is respected even in the deformed superspace we define chiral superfields through the standard condition @xmath37 which leads to @xmath38 . using the fact that @xmath39 we write :    @xmath40    the star product of two chiral superfields reads :    @xmath41    by construction the star product respects chirality , i.e. @xmath42 is again a chiral superfield .",
    "this fact allows to define the superpotential as a product of chiral superfields .",
    "ambiguities in extending the @xmath7 superpotentials to the deformed superspace arise due to the fact that in the noncommutative theory : @xmath43 .",
    "different noncommutatitive theories correspond to the same commutative theory .",
    "this problem is analogous to the one arising when trying to quantize a classical theory .",
    "following the procedure used when quantizing a classical theory , in @xcite a possible generalization to the @xmath0 case of the product of chiral superfields is that every product is always fully symmetrized : @xmath44 the symmetrized product ( [ eq:14 ] ) also has the nice property that the result only depends on the deformation parameter @xmath29 through @xmath45 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath46 is symmetric and @xmath47 is grassmannian in nature . as we will see , and already pointed out in @xcite , this feature survives when considering the symmetrized star product of @xmath48 different chiral superfields .",
    "hence while the deformation per se breaks lorentz invariance the resulting theories remain lorentz covariant @xcite .    in the case of @xmath48",
    "different chiral superfields we symmetrize them according to : @xmath49    we explicitly show the first few examples of the symmetrized star product of chiral superfields in appendix a. when analyzing the examples one can immediately observe that a series in @xmath50 with @xmath51 $ ] is generated$ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath52 . ] .",
    "one also obtains a polynomial in @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "we stress that the only dependence on @xmath6 is via this polynomial .",
    "terms containing explicitly @xmath55 , rather than @xmath56 , will never appear .",
    "this is so since such a term would be of the form : @xmath57 which vanishes upon symmetrization of the chiral superfields .    using appendix a as a guide it is not hard to guess , and then prove by induction , that the generic product of @xmath48 chiral superfields is : @xmath58}(-\\det    c)^jb_j(n)\\prod_{k = n - j+1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta\\theta}\\phi_k    \\vert_s \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a polynomial in the fields of the form : @xmath60 and the coefficients @xmath61 are constructed as follows : consider @xmath62 operators @xmath63 .",
    "then the coefficient @xmath61 is the sum of all possible terms of the form : @xmath64 where the superfields are ordered according to @xmath65 .",
    "unfortunately @xmath59 is a rather complicated function to work with .",
    "however it has been shown in @xcite that it is much more convenient to expand a generic function of superfields around their bosonic component . in this way they were able to construct the @xmath0 chiral model with a single field .",
    "as stated at the beginning we will address the problem of how to generalize the @xmath0 model to contain an arbitrary number of chiral superfields .",
    "this will greatly simplify not only the construction of the superpotential but also the one of the khler .",
    "the antichiral superfields are defined via the standard condition @xmath66 . therefore @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "it turns out that : @xmath69=4\\overline{\\theta}\\overline{\\theta }    c^{\\mu\\nu } \\ .\\ ] ]    we therefore have to order the @xmath70 s and multiply antichiral superfields according to :    @xmath71    as in the case of just chiral superfields we will symmetrize with respect to all of the antichiral superfields . since @xmath72 is antisymmetric",
    "we obtain :    @xmath73    i.e. there are no corrections due to the star product of antichiral superfields with respect to the ordinary product .",
    "this is also true for the star product of @xmath48 different antichiral superfields :    @xmath74    the previous identity can be proved using induction .",
    "the situation becomes more involved when one needs to multiply fields with opposite chirality . in this case",
    "it is necessary to expand the antichiral superfield as follows :    @xmath75    and multiply them according to :    @xmath76",
    "the main goal is to construct the most general chiral sigma model lagrangian in @xmath9 superspace featuring an arbitrary number of different ( anti)chiral superfields .",
    "the starting point is the generic chiral sigma model in four spacetime dimensions in @xmath7 which is usually represented as the sum of a khler term and a superpotential : @xmath77 we then deform the superspace and indicate this deformation by adding a star label for the superpotential and the khler : @xmath78 in the deformed @xmath9 superspace we understand the previous expression in terms of a series with every standard product replaced by a star product .      we focus our attention first on the deformed superpotential .",
    "following @xcite we choose to expand around the bosonic component fields @xmath79 of the chiral superfields .",
    "therefore we define : @xmath80 and expand the deformed superpotential according to : @xmath81 where the expansion coefficients are given by : @xmath82    we now recall ( [ eq:16 ] ) but with every chiral superfield replaced by the associated @xmath83 . to fully determine such an expression we need to determine the generic product : @xmath84    more specifically we need to determine @xmath59 .",
    "having subtracted the scalar component leads to a large number of simplifications .",
    "for example :    @xmath85    and therefore @xmath86 .",
    "this means that at maximum two l s can be next to each other in @xmath59 .",
    "further cancellations appear due to the symmetrization in the fields .",
    "namely the following constraints hold :    @xmath87    by definition @xmath59 contains @xmath62 operators @xmath63 and @xmath88 fields @xmath89 . because of the above constraints the number of fields can be no larger than the number of operators plus two : @xmath90 .",
    "so , in order to obtain non - vanishing contributions we must have : @xmath91 \\ .\\ ] ] if @xmath48 is even we get non - vanishing contributions for @xmath92 and @xmath93 and if @xmath48 is odd we get non - vanishing contributions only for @xmath94 . if @xmath48 is even a bit of algebra yields :    @xmath95    and if @xmath48 is odd : @xmath96 the most general superpotential in @xmath9 superspace is then : @xmath97 where we have used the fact that @xmath98 is symmetric in all its indices .",
    "the situation is considerably more involved for the explicit determination of the khler potential .",
    "we now have also to consider antichiral superfields and their product with chiral superfields .",
    "we start by defining @xmath99 which leads to the immediate constraint : @xmath100 in components @xmath101    the khler potential admits the following series expansion : @xmath102 where each term is fully symmetrized in the chiral and antichiral superfields .",
    "the expansion coefficients are : @xmath103 the first four terms in ( [ eq:38 ] ) either vanish or do not give any contribution in the deformation parameter @xmath104 to the lagrangian .",
    "only the last term induces corrections due to the deformed superspace .",
    "we start by analyzing in detail the case @xmath105 in the last term of the series .",
    "we will use the trace identity : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are two generic chiral superfields .",
    "symmetrizing in the antichiral field @xmath109 and using the above identity , we obtain : @xmath110    for @xmath105 we can immediately find using ( [ eq:17 ] ) together with ( [ eq:36 ] ) and ( [ eq:41 ] ) : @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116    we have also used the fact that the expansion coefficients are symmetric in their unbarred indices .",
    "what we now have left to address is the case @xmath117 .",
    "we will proceed in a manner similar to the @xmath105 case . by first symmetrizing @xmath118 and using the trace identity",
    "we find : @xmath119 the interested reader can find the complete computation , much more involved than for the @xmath105 case in the appendix b. here it is sufficient to report the final contribution of this term to the lagrangian :    @xmath120    @xmath121    @xmath122    @xmath123    @xmath124",
    "we can now summarize in components the generic chiral sigma model lagrangian for an arbitrary number of chiral superfields .",
    "this is achieved by combining ( [ eq:37 ] ) and ( [ eq:18]),([eq:54 ] ) as well as ( [ eq:38 ] ) .",
    "the deformed theory is then :    @xmath125    this is the complete expression for the chiral model with a generic number of chiral superfields .",
    "a similar action in the two dimensional deformed superspace framework has been developed by chandrasekhar and kumar in @xcite . as already noticed by seiberg the theory splits into the @xmath126 lagrangian and a part depending on the deformation parameter via its determinant .",
    "the result is quite involved and generalizes the single field result for the four dimensional superspace due to .",
    "a few observations are in order .",
    "it is rather hard to integrate out the auxiliary fields without invoking an expansion in the deformation parameter @xmath127 when the khler is not just a simple quadratic term in the superfields .",
    "another subtle point is in the definition of the deformed khler .",
    "when deriving the previous lagrangian we have _ fully _ symmetrized the chiral and antichiral superfields in performing the star product associated to the expansion of the khler potential .",
    "this seems to lead to few differences with previous results obtained in the literature both for the deformed four dimensional superspace @xcite as well as the two dimensional one @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the differences might arise due to apparently different definitions for the modified khler potential .",
    "we have already explained that we have symmetrized with respect to both chiral and antichiral fields treating the khler .",
    "this is the same procedure we have used for the superpotential with different chiral superfields .",
    "however one could also imagine to symmetrize independently the ( anti)chiral superfields per se and then multiply them together just before integrating in the superspace variables .",
    "the two procedures lead to different terms emerging in the lagrangian .",
    "note that to observe such differences one has to consider at least two antichiral superfields and more than one chiral field in the khler .",
    "if we consider the second symmetrization the terms in the lagrangian modify as follows : the fifth term counting from the bottom becomes : @xmath128 a new term appears which is : @xmath129 this would then seem to agree with the results found in @xcite when specializing to the single field theory .",
    "the limit of a single field can be found in appendix c.",
    "recently it was shown that both , in the two dimensional case and in the four dimensional case with only one chiral superfield it is possible to express the above lagrangian in a more compact from .",
    "this is possible in our case as well with the introduction of the following functions : @xmath130    @xmath131    @xmath132    @xmath133    the lagrangian presented in ( [ eq:55 ] ) can than be rewritten as : @xmath134 interestingly even though the full lagrangian can be expressed in a simple manner it still does not exhibit the standard structure of the original supersymmetric chiral model .",
    "specifically there are three terms which - for a generic khler potential - break the khler structure .",
    "this is perhaps not too surprising since the @xmath135 deformed superspace is not expected to be a khler manifold",
    ".    it might also be instructive to rewrite the previous lagrangian in a new form in which only two terms breaking the khler structure of the theory appear : and @xmath136    @xmath137    as we have already discussed different symmetrization procedures of the fields within the khler potential lead to different terms appearing in the lagrangian . in deriving the lagrangian ( [ eq:14v ] ) we fully symmetrized both the chiral and antichiral superfields .",
    "if we choose , however , to symmetrize the chiral and antichiral superfields independently and then we multiply them together we obtain , in addition to the lagrangian ( [ eq:14v ] ) , two new terms which spoil the khler structure of the original supersymmetric theory . the full lagrangian assuming this second symmetrization reads : @xmath138 it is important to stress that this point seems to have been overlooked in the literature .",
    "it is hard to solve for the potential of the theory with a general khler .",
    "however integrating out the auxiliary fields is straightforward in the case of the standard khler ( i.e. made only out of the sum of quadratic terms for each field ) . in this case",
    "the potential of the theory can be written explicitly in terms of the scalar components of the chiral and antichiral superfields : @xmath139 we recall that we are in the euclidean space .",
    "it is not clear how to continue in the minkowski space .",
    "interesting attempts to define deformed superspaces suitable for minkowski space are provided in @xcite .",
    "one could imagine to perform the continuation after the full superspace integration has been performed . what would be the ground state of the theory ?",
    "the potential is , in general , complex and hence it would describe an unstable theory .",
    "we now propose a toy model for which the potential of the theory at the component level , and after having integrated out the auxiliary field , contains an infinite number of terms .",
    "interestingly the full series in the deformation parameter can be summed .",
    "consider the superpotential : @xmath140 this superpotential is not renormalizable and should be considered as an effective theory of some more fundamental theory which dynamically generates the energy scale @xmath141 .",
    "summarizing , the @xmath7 theory we consider is then : @xmath142 the potential of the theory obtained after replacing the ordinary product with a star product can now be computed and reads : @xmath143= \\frac{(\\lambda \\bar{\\lambda})^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\sqrt{{\\rm det } c } } \\arctan \\left[\\frac{(\\lambda \\bar{\\lambda})^{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\sqrt{{\\rm det } c } } { \\bar{a}a}\\right ] \\",

    "although we are forced , by the very definition of the deformed superspace , to be in the euclidean space the structure of the potential is so intriguing that we have been tempted to analytically continue our example in the minkowski space .",
    "if we choose @xmath144 to be real this potential is real and also positive definite .",
    "regardless of whether @xmath145 is positive or negative . in the limit of null deformation one recovers the @xmath7 supersymmetric potential which has a runaway vacuum at large values of the scalar field @xmath146 .",
    "the main problem with reality is that even if we assume the determinant of the deformation parameter @xmath29 to be real the potential contains terms of the type : @xmath147 where , for simplicity , we are considering the single field theory .",
    "these terms are , for a generic superpotential , non symmetric under the exchange of @xmath146 with @xmath148 . in our example",
    "we have shown that it is possible to construct a superpotential which leads to terms in the deformed extension of the potential symmetric in the exchange of @xmath146 with @xmath148 .",
    "this is a quite distinctive property of the example presented .",
    "this exchange symmetry becomes the self conjugation property of the potential once continued the model in the minkowski space .",
    "it is interesting to compare the behavior of the new potential with the one in the @xmath7 theory . at large values of the fields",
    "the deformed and undeformed theory share the same properties , i.e. the vacuum of the theory is still of a runaway type .",
    "the main differences arise near the origin of the field space is negative . in this case",

    "another property of this potential is the natural presence of two scales , i.e. the dynamically generated one @xmath141 due perhaps to some strongly interacting underlying gauge theory and the one associated to the deformation parameter @xmath29 which can be linked ( see @xcite ) to a nontrivial graviphoton background .",
    "the noncommutative space modifies , at the potential level , the low energy behavior of the theory .",
    "it naturally introduces a new maximum with a finite value of the potential while the theory still preserves lorentz symmetry @xcite .",
    "the presence of the gravity scale together with another dynamically generated scale as well as the fact that the potential is very flat suggests that the effective theory explored here and more generally theories emerging from the deformed superspace @xcite , after coupling with gravity , could potentially lead to interesting models of inflation when trying to identify the inflaton with the field @xmath146 .",
    "interestingly our toy model provides an example of the so called natural type @xcite of inflationary models which , however , does not emerge due to spontaneous symmetry breaking but due to an underlying superspace deformation .",
    "we have constructed the component form of the most general chiral model theory with an arbitrary number of chiral superfields in the deformed @xmath152 superspace theory in four dimensions .",
    "this generalizes the work in @xcite presented for a single chiral superfield . due to the fact that the product of chiral superfields does not commute in the deformed superspace we used , following @xcite , an ordering procedure which renders the generalization to an arbitrary number of fields technically involved .",
    "we have also elucidated some issues related to how the khler of the theory is handled .",
    "more precisely we show that certain terms , present in @xcite , are actually absent when considering the fully symmetrized deformed khler of the theory with respect to both chiral and antichiral superfields simultaneously .",
    "having determined the general chiral model for @xmath8 with an arbitrary number of superfields will allow to investigate the deformations of a number of chiral models derived in the @xmath7 supersymmetric contest .",
    "it would also be interesting , in the future , to investigate the phase structure of these theories @xcite .",

    "here we have shown that , if the determinant of the deformation parameter is real and positive , also the potential is real and positive .",
    "the vacuum structure of the theory is unchanged with respect to the undeformed space while the potential is largely affected in the infrared , i.e. for small values of the bosonic field values .",
    "the deformation naturally introduces a new maximum with a finite value of the potential at the origin of the field space while the theory still preserves lorentz symmetry @xcite .",
    "the presence of two scales , i.e. the one associated to the deformation parameter , naturally linked to the the gravity scale , together with another ( possibly dynamically generated ) scale as well as the fact that the potential is very flat at large values of the bosonic field suggests that the toy model explored here and more generally theories emerging from the deformed superspace @xcite may lead to interesting models of inflation .",

    "in the main text we arrived at the expression @xmath157 which we now express in terms of the components fields . in order to perform",
    "such a computation we now use once more ( [ eq:16 ] ) .",
    "the analysis is then similar to the one for the superpotential .",
    "this means that we will consider the antichiral field @xmath109 as , yet just another field and hence define : @xmath158 we now wish to compute the product : @xmath159 where the symmetrization is in all of the @xmath160 indices . since @xmath161 is no longer a chiral superfield the constraints ( [ eq:33]),([eq:34 ] ) are no longer valid .",

    "if @xmath48 is odd we have @xmath94 and @xmath171 .",

    "the only term of @xmath118 containing a @xmath180 ( required from superspace integration ) also contains a @xmath181 and therefore the terms containing no @xmath6 s of ( [ eq:47 ] ) and ( [ eq:49 ] ) vanish in the end .",
    "also we can not have @xmath109 standing alone with an operator acting on it , simply because it will only contain a @xmath181 and therefore vanishes when multiplied with @xmath118 .",
    "therefore when symmetrizing in @xmath182 we obtain for @xmath172 : @xmath183    for @xmath177",
    "we get : @xmath184 it is now time that we write it out in components . if we remember that every time a term contains three spinors or more it vanishes after symmetrization and if we use the fact that the expansion coefficients are symmetric in their indices we obtain for @xmath48 even : @xmath185 @xmath186 @xmath187 and for @xmath48 odd : @xmath188 @xmath189 @xmath190 the contribution to the lagrangian therefore is : @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath191    finally together with ( [ eq:37 ] ) , ( [ eq:18]),([eq:54 ] ) as well as ( [ eq:38 ] ) the entire lagrangian can be constructed .",
