    "the recognition of proper names constitutes one of the major problems for the wealth of tagging systems developed in the last few years .",
    "most of these systems are statistically based and make use of statistical properties which are acquired from a large manually tagged training corpus .",
    "the formation of new proper names , especially personal names , is very productive , and it is not feasible to list them in a static lexicon . as church @xcite already discussed for english , it is difficult to decide whether a capitalized word is a proper name if it has a low frequency ( @xmath0 20 ) , and so they were removed from the lexicon .",
    "but because they are highly individual , this is the case for most proper names .",
    "furthermore , the problem of proper name tagging for german is not restricted to the disambiguation of sentence  initial words , because proper names and generic terms ( normal nouns ) are capitalized both at the beginning and within a sentence .",
    "church suggested labelling words as proper nouns if they are `` adjacent to '' other capitalized words .",
    "this also holds for german proper nouns , but it is difficult to decide which of the capitalized words belong to the proper name and which not , e.g. is it a first name ( as in `` helmut kohl '' ) or is it an apposition ( as in `` bundeskanzler kohl '' ) , or is it a complex institutional name composed of several generic terms and a proper name ( as in `` vereinigte staaten von amerika '' ) . in this procedure ,",
    "i use church s heuristic for the selection of proper name hypotheses , which are evaluated on the basis of their syntactic and textual context together with a morphological analysis .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is a small database of definite minimal contexts like titles ( e.g. `` prof . '' , `` dr . '' ) and forms of address ( e.g. `` herr '' , `` frau '' ) , which increases with the processing of texts in which proper names are identified , and supplies new contexts which can be used to find new proper names and new contexts , etc .. this incremental method is applied to unrestricted texts of a small corpus ( 50,000 words ) of german newspapers .",
    "from a psycholinguistic point of view it is possible that we memorize proper names better if we organize them in a hierarchy , in which each word would constitute a node whose subordinate nodes are its hyponyms @xcite . for example , we find in the semantic hierarchy in figure 1 socrates as hyponym of philosopher and philosopher as hyponym of scholar , and each node may bear features describing properties of the node .    [",
    "fig : semnet ]    one can observe that hyperonyms of names are used to identify or to introduce a proper name in texts . if the knowledge of a name can not be presupposed , then the name is often introduced by an appositional construction ( 1)-(2 ) @xcite and can be used without additional information ( 3)(4 ) @xcite later on .",
    "* der vorsitzende des verteidigungsausschusses , _ biehle _ ( csu ) , hat verteidigungsminister _ wrner _ gebeten , ... + ( the chair of the defence committee , _ biehle _ ( csu ) , asked the minister of defence _ wrner _ to ... ) * der spd  abgeordnete _ gerster _ kritisierte , da ... + ( the spd member of parliament _ gerster _ criticized that ... ) * in einem fernschreiben an _ wrner _ , uerte _ biehle _ am dienstag , ... + ( in a telex to _ wrner _ , _ biehle _ commented on tuesday ... ) * _ gerster _ forderte eine mindestflughhe von 300 metern + ( _ gerster _ called for a minimal flying height of 300 metres )    the syntactic analysis ( see section [ sec : entag ] ) operates on a small lexicon of definite minimal contexts of proper names ( mc  lexicon ) which are used in such appositional constructions and generates a lexicon of so  called potential minimal contexts ( mcpot  lexicon ) .",
    "in addition there exist other methods @xcite for the acquisiton of proper names , two of which can be directly observed in the texts .",
    "the first method ( `` lernpsychologische sinnverleihung '' ) tries to lend sense to the name in order to learn it , e.g. the name `` dsseldorf '' is given the meaning of ` village ' .",
    "today it is a big city , but the compound part _ -dorf _ helps us to identify it as a proper name .",
    "the second method , the formation of name fields ( `` namenfelder '' ) and name scenes ( `` namenlandschaften '' ) , helps us to recognize names describing places which belong to a certain district or scenery , e.g. , cities in the stuttgart area like `` tbingen '' , `` reutlingen '' , `` esslingen '' have the common suffix _ -ingen_.    the morphological analysis ( see section [ sec : entag ] ) operates with a list of so  called onomastic suffixes to identify place names .",
    "an overview of the tagging process is shown in figure 2 .    [",
    "fig : entag ]      the corpus has to be preprocessed first of all .",
    "this includes the tokenization of the corpus in which all punctuation marks are separated from the words to allow the following disambiguation of sentence  initial words .",
    "this disambiguation uses a heuristic derived from the one used in claws @xcite : if a sentence  initial word also occurs inside of a sentence with a lower case initial letter , then it is not a noun ( normal noun or proper name ) and represented with lower case letters . for this",
    "i use a list of all words with lower case initial letter found in the corpus which is stored in an avl ",
    "tree @xcite for better searching and inserting .",
    "after this , a first run through the corpus is done to identify definite proper names occuring in the contexts of the mc  lexicon .",
    "apart from appositons as mentioned above , this lexicon contains speech  embedding ( `` redeeinbettende '' ) verbs like `` sagte''and `` fragte '' frequently used in political newspaper texts , as in :    * die abgeordnete _",
    "kelly _ sagte , ... + ( the member of parliament _ kelly _ said , ... ) * _ heinlein _ fgte hinzu , ... + ( _ heinlein _ added , ... )",
    "* so fragte _ apel _ + ( _ apel _ asked )    the mc - lexicon also contains prepositions and preposition frames to identify place names , as in :    * bei _ frankfurt _ + ( near _ frankfurt _ ) * aus _ sllingen _ bei _ baden  baden _ + ( from _ sllingen _ near _ baden  baden _ ) * i m raum _ landshut _ + ( in the _ landshut _ area )    all proper names are stored in the pn ",
    "lexicon which is used during the entire processing .      in the following analysis ,",
    "the immediate syntactic and morphological context of all capitalized words is examined . if the capitalized word is already included in the pn  lexicon , then its immediately preceding context is stored as a potential minimal context in the mcpot ",
    "lexicon if it comprises one or more capitalized words .",
    "cases where the proper name is marked as genitive are not considered because this could lead to wrong mcs ( e.g. , _ aussage wrners , besuch lafontaines _ ) .",
    "the collection of potential minimal contexts is also done in the hypotheses processing , which follows .",
    "for example , the proper name _",
    "wrner _ supplies the mcs : _",
    "bundesverteidigungsminister , verteidigungsminister , minister , nato ",
    "generalsekretr_.    for the recognition of place names , a suffix list is used containing onomastic suffixes like _ acker , aich , beuren , hafen , hausen , stetten , weiler _ and a prefix list containing prefixes like _ mittel , ost , west , zentral_. in addition to this the ending of the left capitalized word of two adjacents is checked for adjectival endings _",
    "er , aner _ , as in :    * mainzer landtag + ( the state parliament of _ mainz _ ) * mnsteraner parteitag + ( the party conference of _ mnster _ )    if they also occur without this ending ( _ mainz , mnster _ ) , then these forms are proper nouns and are stored in the pn  lexicon . the adjectival forms in ( 11)(12 ) are considered as adjectives ( following @xcite , p. 265 ) .",
    "furthermore , loose appositional constructions ( `` lockere appositionelle konstruktionen '' , @xcite ) as in ( 13)(14 ) are analyzed according to the patterns of noun phrases which occur before the proper name .",
    "* der staatssekretr des landesinnenministeriums , _ basten _ , ... + ( the under  secretary of the department of the interior , _ basten _ , ... ) * der chef des schweizer wehrministeriums , bundesrat _ koller _ , ... + ( the director of the swiss department of the armed forces , the minister of state _ koller _ , ... )    during this run through the corpus , a second avl ",
    "tree is constructed in which all capitalized words are stored together with some information that can be useful for the hypotheses processing . for each word ( node )",
    "there is a counter for all occurences of the word with an article and a list of all its immediately preceding words , if these are also capitalized or are prepositions ( see table 1 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the non - german proper names are often put in quotation marks , so this could be an additional criterion for the hypotheses evaluation , but cases in which quotation marks are used to emphasize or to cite one or more words must be excluded ( 24 ) .",
    "* die fdp warnt vor `` panikmache '' + ( the fdp warns of `` panic mongering '' )    multi  word proper names consisting of normal nouns or mixed of normal nouns , adjectives , articles , prepositions and proper names constitute a major problem .",
    "apart from the fact that adjectives and prepositions belonging to a proper name are capitalized , some of these proper names ( 25 ) behave like normal nouns , i.e. , they are inflectional and take an article , but some do not ( 26)-(28 ) .",
    "the latter are mostly used with an introductory apposition and often put in quotation marks . for one",
    "it is difficult to determine which constituents belong to the proper name , and which do not when the construction can be modified and reduced as well ( e.g. _ vereinigte staaten von amerika , die staaten , die bundesrepublik , deutschland _ ) . under the more distributional analysis described here ,",
    "it is not possible to recognize them and no easy solution is possible . in secondly place , it is possible to recognize them if we know the minimal context ( here _ luftwaffenbasis , gasthaus , strae _ ) , which may be resolved if we use a very large corpus , and if we consider more than one following word and existing quotation marks .",
    "* _ die vereinigten staaten _",
    "die bundesrepublik deutschland _",

    "quantity terms could be excluded by an exception list and month names could be added to the en  lexicon from the start .    * ein dutzend personenwagen / demonstranten + ( a dozen automobiles / demonstrators ) * mindestens vierzig prozent kandidatinnen + ( at least 40 per cent candidates ) * nach metern abstand + ( after a distance of some metres ) * mitte april / ende september + ( in the middle of april / at the end of september )    but some of the remaining hypotheses are the result of a free german word order , often observed in sentences with support verb constructions ( 34 : _ ernst machen mit _ ( to be serious about ) , 35 : _ stellung beziehen gegen _",
    "( to take a stand against ) ) .",
    "the hypotheses ` kanzleramt erwgungen ' in sentence ( 33 ) could be ruled out if the form ` erwgungen ' was analyzed as a non",
    " possible inflection form of a proper noun and therefore as a normal noun .",
    "this was not performed by the morphological analysis , because there were no occurrences of ` erwgung ' without a plural ending in the corpus .",
    "this could be improved by the use of a very large corpus or a powerful morphological analyzer ( e.g. gertwol , @xcite ) .",
    "the support verb constructions could be excluded if we look for typical verbs used in such constructions ( _ machen , bringen , nehmen , ... _ ) .    * ... war bekanntgeworden , da i m kanzleramt erwgungen [ ... ] stattfnden , wie ... + ( ... became known that the chancellorship takes into consideration ... ) * ... wenn seine partei ernst macht mit ... + ( ... if his party gets serious about ... ) * ... indem man [ ... ] gegen die bundespartei stellung bezieht + ( ... while taking a stand against the federal party )    most of the incorrectly tagged proper names are the result of the hypotheses processing , because the corpus is too small .",
    "for example , the evaluation of the hypothesis ` ohne rcksicht ' ( with no consideration ) provides ` rcksicht ' as proper name , because it also occurs with the preposition ` aus ' ( from ) , which is frequently used with place names and never occurs with an article , but its frequency is only 4 .",
    "this is not representative for a reliable conclusion and it is hoped that a very large corpus would allow for a better analysis .",
    "most of the known statistically based tagging systems are confronted with the problem of proper name tagging . in german",
    "the problem is not only restricted to the disambiguation of sentence  initial words but also occurs with sentence  internal capitalized words .",
    "the procedure of proper name tagging described here makes use of a database of definite minimal contexts as a starting point for an analysis which takes into account both morphological and syntactic properties of proper names .",
    "furthermore , this local analysis is supported by a global analysis regarding all occurrences of capitalized words in the corpus . this global analysis",
    "should be improved by a larger corpus than the one used , and a more meaningful statistic procedure , like _ mutual information _ @xcite . however , the central idea of an incremental procedure for the collection of proper name contexts is encouraging .",
    "it is planned to include this proper name tagging in the german part - of - speech tagger likely @xcite developed in tbingen to disambiguate all the remaining cases where the tagger could not decide between proper name or normal noun .",
