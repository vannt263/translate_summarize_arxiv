    "a large sample of galaxies at @xmath12 has become available owing to the observational technique of selecting high - redshift galaxies by broad - band color signatures when the lyman limit spectral discontinuity at 912    passes through different filters ; the so - called lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , most surveys have been carried out at optical wavelengths , which corresponds to lbgs in the rest - frame far ultra - violet ( uv ) .",
    "such observations have detected strong clustering of lbgs @xcite , which has generally been interpreted as indirect evidence that lbgs reside in massive dark matter halos .",
    "however , the true character of lbgs and their evolutionary history remain uncertain . in one scenario ,",
    "lbgs are low - mass , merger - induced starbursting systems , and are the precursors of present day low - mass spheroids @xcite . in another scenario",
    ", they have stellar mass of @xmath13 , sitting in massive dark matter halos and continuously forming stars over a period of 1 gyr . they evolve into bright elliptical and spiral galaxies at @xmath1 , and later merge into clusters or groups of galaxies @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that they are massive galaxies experiencing merger - induced starbursts @xcite .    in order to clarify the stellar content and the star formation histories of lbgs , near infra - red ( ir ) studies of lbgs",
    "have recently been carried out @xcite .",
    "these observations directly probe the rest - frame optical properties of lbgs at @xmath5 ; wavelengths less affected by dust obscuration .",
    "however , the number of galaxies used in these studies is still small , and the inferred star formation time - scale and the values of extinction differ somewhat among authors due to different sample selection and different modeling of seds used in their analyses .",
    "nevertheless , the median value of extinction seems to lie in the range @xmath14 , and the recent studies seem to indicate the existence of a significant old stellar population in lbgs at @xmath5 with the stellar mass of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite used the observed oxygen lines in the rest - frame optical to estimate the metallicity of lbgs to be @xmath15 .    in this article , we focus on the merger history and the star formation history of lbgs from @xmath0 to 0 , as well as their stellar content .",
    "we follow the merger trees of galaxies both backward and forward in time , and examine the stellar mass of progenitors and descendants of lbgs as well as their star formation histories .",
    "we hope to provide some insights on how lbgs fit into the overall galaxy formation picture in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ; in particular , we address what kind of objects lbgs form from , and what type of objects lbgs evolve into .    in our earlier papers , we discussed the star formation history , stellar metallicity distribution , luminosity function , and color distribution of galaxies in a @xmath2cdm universe using the same simulation .",
    "there we showed that the agreement between local observations and the simulation was relatively good , considering the uncertainties involved on both sides , and argued that we are beginning to obtain meaningful results for the global properties of galaxies in large - scale hydrodynamic simulations , with the hydrodynamic mesh approaching @xmath16 .",
    "the simulation used in this paper has a box size of @xmath17 with eulerian hydrodynamic mesh of @xmath18 and cosmological parameters of @xmath19 ( see paper  i for the details of the simulation ) .",
    "other numerical studies of lbgs using hydrodynamic simulations exist . @xcite",
    "and @xcite used a smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulation with a box size of @xmath20 , which was stopped at @xmath21 , due to a lack of long wavelength perturbations .",
    "therefore , they can not check whether the properties of the simulated galaxies are consistent with local galaxy observations , in particular , the luminosity function , the color distribution of galaxies , and the stellar matter density at @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the simulation used in this paper is continued up to @xmath1 .",
    "the advantage of sph simulations is much higher spatial resolution than that of eulerian simulations , but the sph mass resolution is usually about an order of magnitude worse than that of the eulerian method which is adopted in this paper . with these differences in the simulations ,",
    "it is interesting to compare the results from the two types of simulations . comparisons with the work of @xcite and @xcite will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the present work extends and complements earlier works .    as in paper",
    "ii , we identify galaxies using the grouping algorithm hop @xcite , and use the isochrone synthesis model gissel99 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* charlot 1999 , private communication ) to obtain the stellar luminosity output in the simulation .",
    "we assume an initial mass function of @xcite with a turnover at the low - mass end as reported by @xcite .    in   [ section :",
    "selection_lbg ] , we describe how we select lbgs in our simulation . the rest - frame @xmath3 band luminosity function of galaxies at @xmath5 in the simulation is presented in ",
    "[ section : lf_lbg ] , which is compared with the observed one .",
    "we discuss the stellar mass of lbgs in ",

    "  [ section : fate_lbg ] ( @xmath23 ) , and the progenitor masses and the fate of lbgs are discussed .",
    "the star formation rate of lbgs is studied in   [ section : sfr_lbg ] , with emphasis on instantaneous vs. continuous star formation . in   [ section : metal_lbg ] , we discuss the metallicity of lbgs and the evolution of the entire luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "we conclude in   [ section : conclusion_lbg ] .",
    "observers select galaxies efficiently at @xmath24 by using a color selection criteria in color - color space ( e.g. with @xmath25 filters ; * ? ? ?",
    "by doing so , they select out star forming galaxies that are bright in far - uv at @xmath24 . therefore , it is often assumed that lbgs have similar properties to the local starburst galaxies .",
    "based on this expectation , many authors use an empirical extinction law of local starburst galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to model the internal dust extinction in these galaxies .",
    "if we were to mimic the observational color - selection criteria , we would need to obtain the extinction @xmath26 for each galaxy with some assumptions ; for example , its proportionality to the metallicity and the star formation rate of each galaxy .",
    "an empirical extinction law for the wavelength dependence ( e.g. galactic , small magellanic cloud , or starburst ) also has to be assumed .",
    "the position of galaxies in a color - color space depends significantly on the effect of dust extinction , which is highly uncertain , and therefore the selection of galaxies will depend on the assumptions made for the calculation of @xmath26 and the assumed extinction law .",
    "in particular , galaxies which have very high star formation rate may be strongly obscured and do not satisfy the color - selection criteria in the model .",
    "however , in reality , it is not clear how strongly these star - forming galaxies are obscured ( e.g. there may be less obscuration due to the sweeping of dust clouds by galactic winds @xcite .",
    "therefore , those galaxies which do not pass the color - selection criteria after dust extinction in the simulation may well be detected in reality within the current magnitude limit in the rest - frame @xmath3 band given that they are also intrinsically bright in the optical wavelengths as we show in .    in the left panel of , we plot the computed rest - frame @xmath3 band luminosity and the rest - frame far - uv luminosity ( summing all flux below @xmath27 ) of galaxies at @xmath5 in our simulation before taking dust extinction into account ( i.e. the intrinsic luminosity ) .",
    "the magnitude limit of @xmath28 ( which roughly corresponds to @xmath29 of the near - ir observations by @xcite with @xmath30 ) is indicated by the vertical short - dashed line and the arrow to the right .",
    "the horizontal long - dashed line and the upward arrow roughly indicate the far - uv selection criteria of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "note that the rest - frame @xmath3 band selected sample includes a broad range of values of far - uv luminosity .",
    "most current near - ir samples are first selected in the rest - frame far - uv , and then in the near - ir , therefore they are drawn from the upper right corner of this diagram @xcite . however , near - ir selected samples are becoming available @xcite , and there will be more in the future .",
    "therefore , rather than introducing further uncertainties in our analysis by invoking a certain color - selection criteria , here we consider all galaxies that are brighter than @xmath4 , and investigate the range of properties of the luminous galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "but we do estimate the effect of dust extinction by making a few assumptions . in the right panel of",

    "( ii ) the @xcite extinction law @xmath41 is assumed , where @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath41 is obtained empirically from local starburst galaxies , and the function @xmath43 is the spectral energy distribution of galaxies .    the decrease in the @xmath3 band luminosity is smaller than that in the far - uv luminosity , as the extinction law @xmath41 is a decreasing function of wavelength .",
    "galaxies that are brighter than @xmath4 after dust extinction are indicated by the empty squares in the right panel of .",
    "the same galaxies are indicated by the same symbol in the left panel .",
    "the scatter of the points is somewhat larger in the right panel , and the most far - uv luminous galaxies in the left panel have moved to lower far - uv luminosity in the right panel because of the assumed proportionality between @xmath26 and the star formation rate .",
    "in , we show the computed rest - frame @xmath3 band luminosity function of galaxies at @xmath5 in the solid histogram ( before dust extinction ) .",
    "the schechter function fits at @xmath44 and 5 are shown as the short - dashed , solid , and long - dashed curves , respectively .",
    "the method for the schechter fit is as follows : first we fix the faint - end slope to @xmath45 ( this value is consistent with the empirical one in @xmath46 band at @xmath1 . see paper ii . ) , then adjust the normalization @xmath47 to fit the plateau at the faint end of the luminosity function , and then choose the characteristic magnitude @xmath48 so that the integral of the schechter function is equal to the total @xmath3 band luminosity density in the simulation box .",
    "this fitting method is adopted to take into account of the luminosity of a few overmerged objects in the simulation ( see paper ii ) . at @xmath5",

    "this suggests that the intrinsic value of @xmath55 could be much larger than that given by @xcite .",
    "the observational estimate of the faint end slope @xmath56 is significantly steeper than the simulated result , but this is perhaps due to the fact that they have only observed the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "our result suggests that , with the magnitude limit of @xmath57 , one is not seeing the faint - end of the luminosity function sufficiently at @xmath5 , and dust extinction exacerbates the situation .",
    "therefore it is observationally difficult to derive the schechter parameters correctly with the current detection limit .",

    "it is encouraging that we get this level of agreement between the simulation and the observations without any fine - tuning of the parameters of the simulation .",
    "our simulation predicts a rest - frame @xmath3 band comoving luminosity density of @xmath60 ( before extinction ) and @xmath61 ( after extinction ) , when the luminosity of all the galaxies in the simulation is summed up .",
    "if the sum is taken only for the galaxies above the detection limit of @xmath4 , we get @xmath62 ( before extinction ) and @xmath63 ( after extinction ) .",

    "interestingly , gid=30 has the smallest stellar mass among the three , but it is the brightest because it had a starburst closer to @xmath5 than the other two .",
    "the galaxy gid=96 offers an interesting example , where we see a major starburst at @xmath12 but no corresponding major merger event during the same period .",
    "a significant gas infall without a galaxy merger event must have taken place in this case .",

    "it experiences a moderate number of merger events at @xmath85 , and has continuously formed stars over a period of 1 gyr .",
    "the galaxy gid=2 is also interesting in that it has almost no star formation activity in the interval @xmath12 , but is still bright enough at @xmath5 because of the significant star formation at @xmath86 associated with multiple merger events .",
    "this object merges into the same group at @xmath1 as gid=0 does .    to summarize , the majority of lbgs that are intrinsically brighter than @xmath87 at @xmath5 have experienced intensive star formation activities ( @xmath88 ) within 500  myr prior to @xmath5 , often lasting for a period of @xmath89  myr , resulting in a stellar mass of @xmath90 .",
    "besides the starbursts , the progenitors of these bright lbgs have continuously formed stars over a period of 1  gyr since @xmath77 when they are coadded . qualitatively",
    ", these histories seem to be consistent with the star formation histories inferred from recent near - ir observations of lbgs @xcite .",

    ", we see no quiescent star formation at low - redshift , which agrees with the observed absence of star formation in clusters of galaxies at late times .",

    "this system has only one lbg as its precursor at @xmath5 , and this lbg remains untouched until @xmath107 .",

    ", we show the cumulative stellar mass fraction as a function of the age of the universe for the total box ( short dashed ) , descendants of the lbgs which are brighter than @xmath4 at @xmath5 ( solid ) , and the cluster shown in panel ( a ) of .",
    "the long dashed lines indicate two epochs : @xmath5 and @xmath109 gyr , where @xmath110 is the age of the universe . the intersections with the solid curve show that the descendants of lbgs today have formed @xmath111% of their stellar mass by @xmath5 , and @xmath112% by @xmath109 gyr .",
    "in other words , 50% of the present day stellar population in lbg descendants is 10 gyr old .",
    "together with the merger trees presented in the previous subsection , this suggests that the stars we see as lbgs at @xmath5 will evolve into massive old stellar component of the present day galaxies ; i.e. the ` spheroids ' ( bulges of spirals and luminous ellipticals )",

    "unfortunately , due to limited spatial resolution of our simulation , we can not address the question of what happens to the lbgs that fall into clusters .",

    "in , we show the instantaneous star formation rate of galaxies at @xmath114 and 5 , calculated by averaging over 20  myr at each epoch , as a function of rest - frame @xmath3 band absolute magnitude ( before dust extinction ) . we have confirmed that the result is robust against the change in the time - scale of the averaging .",
    "those which are assigned @xmath115 $ ] happen to have no star formation at that particular epoch , due to the intermittent nature of the star formation in the simulation .",
    "note that ongoing star formation due to recycled matter within a galaxy might not be captured in this simulation due both to limited spatial resolution and the nature of the star formation recipe implemented in the simulation .",
    "the vertical dashed line at @xmath5 indicates the detection limit of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "there is a relatively strong correlation between the instantaneous sfr and the luminosity of galaxies at @xmath116 : more luminous galaxies are forming stars more actively .",
    "because of the correlation between luminosity and stellar mass shown in , this means that more massive galaxies are forming stars more actively on average in our simulation .",
    "galaxies that are brighter than @xmath4 take a wide range of instantaneous sfr ; from @xmath117 to a few @xmath118 .",
    "galaxies at the detection limit have values ranging from @xmath117 to @xmath119 . at lower redshifts ( @xmath120 ) ,",
    "star formation becomes inactive on average , as was shown in paper  i.    in , we plot ` instantaneous sfr(20myr ) ' ( averaged over 20  myr ) vs. ` continuous sfr(200myr ) ' ( averaged over 200  myr ) of galaxies in the simulation .",
    "the diagonal solid line indicates where the two sfrs take the same value ; i.e. the star formation is continuous over at least 200  myr at the same level of sfr(20myr ) .",
    "the dashed lines in @xmath0 and @xmath5 panels indicate the relation @xmath121 . at @xmath0 and 3 ,",
    "the lower envelope of the distribution follows the dashed line , indicating that in some galaxies star formation is episodic ; i.e. the level of sfr(20myr ) is not maintained over the period of 200  myr .",
    "therefore , in our simulation , star formation is episodic in some bright lbgs , while in others it is continuous .",
    "there is no clear - cut distinction between the two : both episodic and continuous star formation take place .",
    "the galaxies that are brighter than @xmath4 at @xmath5 occupy the upper end of the distribution .",
    "in , we show the mean stellar metallicity of galaxies in the simulation vs. intrinsic rest - frame @xmath46 band absolute magnitude at redshifts @xmath114 and 5 .",
    "the result at @xmath1 was presented in figure  6 of paper  i with galaxy stellar mass as the x - axis .",
    "the solid square points are the median in each magnitude bin , and the error bars are the quartiles .",
    "the slanted solid line is the best - fit to observational data compiled by @xcite for galaxies at @xmath122 , which shows good agreement with our result at @xmath1 in the range @xmath123 .",
    "the distribution at @xmath1 deviates from the best - fit line at @xmath124 , where we do not have enough statistics in the simulation due to limited box size .",
    "however , the flattening of the distribution at bright magnitudes at @xmath5 is likely to be real .",
    "the entire distribution shifts to lower metallicity at higher redshifts . this can be understood from figure  5 of paper  i , where we showed that the stellar metallicity distribution widens significantly at @xmath116 , taking the values ranging from @xmath125 to @xmath126 .",
    "the physical reason for this effect is that the metallicity is a strong function of local overdensity @xcite .",
    "as time progresses , the universe becomes more clumpy , and star formation takes place only in moderate to high overdensity regions where gas is already polluted by metals , resulting in a narrower scatter of metallicity at late times .",
    "the solid box at @xmath5 indicates the range of metallicity inferred from the oxygen abundance of lbgs @xcite .",
    "the same box is indicated by the dashed line at other redshifts .",
    "our model naturally explains the sub - solar metallicity of lbgs ; they take metallicities of @xmath15 because they are the most luminous galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "the long - dashed horizontal lines at @xmath5 indicate the typical values of metallicity taken by damped lyman @xmath58 systems ( dlas ; @xmath127 , @xcite ) .",
    "lbgs typically have higher metallicity than dlas .",
    "a semianalytic study by @xcite suggests that dlas are extended , high angular momentum , low surface brightness , rotationally supported disks , while lbgs are low angular momentum , compact , high surface brightness , possibly spheroid systems with high star formation rate .",
    "high star formation rate in compact lbgs results in a radial metallicity gradient in a galaxy , with the gas in the outer region having much lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "the connection between lbgs and dlas in our simulation will be discussed in detail in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "using a large - scale hydrodynamic simulation , we study the merger tree , the star formation history , the stellar content , and the metallicity of lbgs .",
    "we focus our attention on galaxies that are intrinsically brighter than @xmath4 at @xmath5 , and investigate the broad range of properties of such galaxies in accordance with recent near - ir observations @xcite .",
    "the computed rest - frame @xmath3 band luminosity function of galaxies at @xmath5 is presented , and a fair agreement with the observed one is found , given the uncertainties in the simulation , the observations , and the theoretical modeling including the initial mass function and the population synthesis model .",
    "we find that the observed luminosity function by @xcite agrees well with the dust extincted simulated luminosity function , and that the intrinsic @xmath55 could be much larger than the value given by @xcite .    the predicted comoving luminosity density in the rest - frame @xmath3 band at @xmath5 is larger than the observed value of @xcite when integrated down to the current detection limit , but is consistent within the uncertainties when dust extinction is taken into account .",
    "a detailed comparison of the total luminosity density at @xmath5 is hindered by the current detection limit , as the schechter parameters can not be determined reliably .",
    "the stellar mass of lbgs that have @xmath128 at @xmath5 lie between @xmath129 and @xmath130 , when dust extinction is taken into account .",
    "the median stellar mass of all lbgs that are intrinsically brighter than @xmath4 at @xmath5 is @xmath7 , in good agreement with the value inferred from a near - ir observation @xcite . at @xmath0 ,",
    "the stellar mass of the progenitors of lbgs ( @xmath28 at @xmath5 ) ranges from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , with a median of @xmath93 .",
    "we find that the majority of lbgs brighter than @xmath87 at @xmath5 fall into groups and clusters of galaxies by @xmath1 .",
    "roughly one half of lbgs with @xmath131 merge into groups / clusters of galaxies , while the other half evolve into typical @xmath10 galaxies with @xmath132 .",
    "present day galaxies with @xmath133 typically have a few lbgs as their progenitors brighter than @xmath4 , with @xmath134 .",
    "descendants of lbgs at the present epoch formed @xmath135% of their stellar mass by @xmath5 , and @xmath136% of their present stellar population is 10  gyr old .",
    "the existence of a significant old stellar population suggests that lbgs may be the precursors of the present day spheroids .",
    "our simulation suggests that lbgs that are brighter than @xmath87 at @xmath5 have experienced a burst of star formation ( @xmath88 ) within 500  myr prior to @xmath5 , often lasting for a period of @xmath137 myr .",
    "we also find that the majority of lbgs brighter than @xmath4 have extended star formation activity at higher redshifts ( @xmath138 ) over a period of 1  gyr , resulting in a median stellar mass of @xmath7 at @xmath5 , in accordance with the picture proposed by @xcite .",
    "there seems to be no clear - cut choice between the two star formation scenarios : the bright lbgs in our simulation exhibit both instantaneous and continuous star formation activity .",
    "our result seems to be in qualitative agreement with the star formation histories inferred from recent near - ir observations of lbgs @xcite .",
    "the stellar content and the merger history we observe in the simulation is not consistent with the picture that lbgs are low - mass starbursting objects which later evolve into low - mass spheroids at @xmath1 @xcite",
    ".    we argued in paper  i that the global star formation rate in the simulation increases toward higher redshifts up to @xmath139 .",
    "together with the results presented in this paper , the existence of high star formation rate galaxies at high - redshift seems to be a generic prediction of the cdm model .",
    "it is an important future task to investigate the link between these galaxies in the simulation and the observation of high - redshift galaxies such as the hubble deep field @xcite and the future next generation space telescope @xcite .",
    "our results on the star formation rates of high - redshift galaxies are in good agreement with the previous studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising given that the simulations used in both studies adopt a similar star formation recipe , although the spatial and the mass resolutions are very different .",
    "the sub - solar metallicity of lbgs at @xmath5 is naturally predicted by our simulation .",
    "the entire luminosity - metallicity distribution shifts to lower metallicity at higher redshifts .",
    "if indeed dlas have metallicity of @xmath140 @xcite , then lbgs typically have higher metallicity than dlas at @xmath5 .",
    "the connection between lbgs and dlas in our simulation will be studied in a separate paper @xcite .",
