    "the nature of phase separation and criticality in ionic fluids with the dominant coulomb interactions ( e.g. , molten salts and electrolytes in solvents of low dielectric constant ) has been an outstanding experimental and theoretical issue for many years .",
    "electrostatic correlations are also known to play an important role in many other technologically relevant systems such as charge - colloidal suspensions , room - temperature ionic liquids and micellar solutions of ionic surfactants .",
    "now , a generally accepted idea is that the gas - liquid and liquid - liquid critical points in ionic fluids belong to the universal class of a three - dimensional ising model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the crossover from the mean - field - like behavior to the ising model criticality when approaching the critical point remains a challenging problem for theory , simulations and experiments @xcite .",
    "the most commonly studied theoretical model of ionic fluids is a restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , which consists of equal numbers of equisized positively and negatively charged hard spheres immersed in a structureless dielectric continuum .",
    "the rpm undergoes a gas - liquid - like phase transition at low temperature and low density @xcite .",
    "theoretical @xcite and numerical @xcite investigations of the gas - liquid criticality in the rpm have provided strong evidence for an ising universal class .",
    "however , an issue of the width of the critical region was not addressed in these works . on the other hand ,",
    "the ginzburg criterion @xcite was used in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to study the crossover from the mean - field to asymptotic regime , but the obtained results failed to give a clear answer to the question of the extent of the crossover region in the model .",
    "recently , using the method of collective variables ( cvs ) @xcite , we have derived the landau - ginzburg ( lg ) hamiltonian for the model of ionic fluids which includes , besides coulomb interactions , short - range attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the developed approach is that it enables us to obtain all the relevant coefficients , including the square - gradient term , within the framework of the same approximation . the ginzburg temperature for the rpm , calculated using this theory turned out to be about @xmath5 times smaller than for a one - component nonionic model .",
    "furthermore , the results obtained for the rpm supplemented by short - range attractive interactions have shown that the ginzburg temperature approaches the value found for the rpm when the strength of coulomb interactions becomes sufficiently large .",
    "these results suggest the key role of coulomb interactions in the reduction of the crossover region . nevertheless , the study of the effect of an interaction range on the ginzburg temperature is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the crossover behavior in ionic fluids .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend the theory to the binary ionic model with screened coulomb interactions .",
    "specifically , we consider a two - component system of particles labeled @xmath6 and @xmath7 , such that the interaction potential between a particle of species @xmath8 and one of the species @xmath9 at a distance @xmath10 apart is as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 . for @xmath13 , eq .  ( [ int - yrpm ] ) describes a symmetrical mixture of hard spheres of the same diameter @xmath14 in which the like particles interact through a repulsive yukawa potential for @xmath15 , and the unlike particles interact through the opposite attractive yukawa potential for @xmath15 .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the case where the number densities of species @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the same , i.e. , @xmath16 . for @xmath17 , the model ( [ int - yrpm ] )",
    "is called a yukawa restricted primitive model ( yrpm ) . in this case , @xmath18 is the charge magnitude and @xmath19 is the dielectric constant of the medium . in the limit @xmath20 , the yrpm reduces to a hard sphere model whereas the rpm",
    "is recovered by taking the limit @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the yrpm can provide a basis for the study of the nature of phase and critical behavior in ionic fluids and in partially ionic fluids .",
    "it is worth noting that the yrpm is often used to model a system of oppositely charged colloids @xcite .",
    "the effective ( screened ) colloid - colloid interactions in such a system are due to the presence of coions and counterions in the solvent . in this case ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath1 take the form : @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the inverse debye screening length , @xmath26 is the bjerrum length , @xmath27 is the salt concentration and @xmath28 is the dielectric constant of the solvent . in a colloid system",
    ", the range of interaction can be modified by changing the salt concentration .    whereas the effect of an interaction range on the gas - liquid phase separation of a simple one - component fluid has been extensively studied ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references herein ) , as far as we know there are only a few works addressing this issue for the case of the yrpm @xcite . in particular , the evolution of the gas - liquid phase diagram of the yrpm as a function of the interaction range was theoretically studied using the integral equation methods @xcite and the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) @xcite .",
    "the results obtained from the generalized mean - spherical approximation ( gmsa ) show that both the critical density and the critical temperature increase above the corresponding values for the rpm when @xmath1 increases @xcite . moreover , the gmsa predicts a nonmonotonous behavior of the critical temperature as a function of @xmath1 : the critical temperature attains a maximum at @xmath29 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the attention was focused on several values of @xmath1 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the gas - liquid coexistence was found for all the listed values .",
    "the highest value for which the gas - liquid coexistence was found within the framework of integral equation methods is @xmath36 with the msa @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the main emphasis is made on the critical behavior of the model .",
    "simulations predict a rich phase diagram involving a gas - liquid phase separation as well as several crystalline phases , which is in agreement with experimental confocal microscopy data for charge - stabilized colloidal suspensions @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate a sensitivity of the phase diagram of the yrpm to the variation of @xmath1 . unlike theoretical predictions @xcite",
    ", it is found @xcite that the gas - liquid separation is not stable with respect to gas - solid coexistence for @xmath37 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the effects of the interaction range on the gas - liquid phase diagram and the ginzburg temperature of the yrpm . to this end , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we find analytical expressions for all the relevant coefficients of the lg hamiltonian in a one - loop approximation .",
    "based on these expressions , first we calculate the gas - liquid critical parameters , spinodals and coexistence curves of the model for @xmath38 . remarkably , there is no gas - liquid critical point for @xmath39 in the approximation considered .",

    ", the tricritical point is the point where the gas - liquid critical point merges with the spinodal branch induced by the charge ordering .",
    "the possible existence of a tricritical point for the yrpm with a large @xmath1 was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath183",
    ", @xmath157 shows a nonmonotonous behavior .",
    "first , @xmath157 increases reaching a maximum at @xmath184 and then for @xmath185 , @xmath157 again decreases approaching the rpm value for @xmath4 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the reduced ginzburg temperature for the yrpm with @xmath186 is about @xmath178 times larger than @xmath157 for the rpm ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore , we have found that an increase in the interaction region from the one typical of nonionic fluids to the one typical of ionic fluids leads to a decrease of the temperature region where the crossover from the mean - field critical behavior to ising model criticality occurs .",
    "extending our previous studies , we have clearly demonstrated that the range of the interactions plays a crucial role in the crossover behavior observed in ionic fluids .",
