    "at the present a wide variety of methods exists to calculate the macroscopic equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantities of many - body systems . however , their potentialities and efficiencies differ sensibly especially when small parameters are absent for intrinsic reasons and the ordinary perturbative expansions appear inadequate",
    ". there exist , for instance , many systems of experimental and theoretical interest which involve strongly interacting microscopic degrees of freedom and exhibit anomalous behavior of the specific heat , susceptibility and other macroscopic quantities which , in turn , indicate various phase transitions to occur in these systems .",
    "therefore , there is always a great interest to search for reliable methods going beyond the conventional perturbation theory to describe correctly nonperturbative phenomena and , especially , the various anomalies in the thermodynamic behavior of systems near a phase transition . in this connection , the two - time green function ( gf ) technique constitutes one of the most powerful tools in quantum statistical mechanics and in condensed matter physics to explore the thermodynamic and transport properties of a wide variety of many - body systems . within this framework , the equations of motion method ( emm ) and the spectral density method ( sdm ) allow to obtain reliable approximations to treat typically nonperturbative problems @xcite .",
    "when one mentions the two time gf technique , one refers usually to their quantum many - body version which is well known from long time and widely and successfully applied in quantum statistical physics .",
    "nevertheless , the pioneering introduction of the two - time gf s and the emm in classical statistical mechanics by bogoljubov and sadovnikov @xcite has opened the concrete possibility to describe classical and quantum many - body systems on the same footing . in this context , it is worth mentioning that , in many physical situations ( when the quantum effects are negligible ) , the use of the classical two - time gf formalism may offer substantial advantages especially from the computational point of view because in the calculations one handles only functions and not operators . in any case , the strong impact of the two - time gf technique in many - body physics and the continuous efforts for obtaining better approximations are well known and , hence , it is unnecessary to stress again its effectiveness and potentialities .",
    "rather , the less known sdm merits further remarks .",
    "the sdm was formulated some decades ago by kalashnikov and fradkin for quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "it is sufficiently simple and has been applied to a wide variety of quantum systems , also exhibiting phase transitions @xcite , as superconductors @xcite , magnetic @xcite and bosonic @xcite systems , strongly correlated electron compounds @xcite , and so on .",
    "it appears more effective than the emm for a direct calculation of two - time gf s , not only because it allows to obtain reliable and systematic nonperturbative approximations , but also because it assures the validity of a number of sum rules irrespective either to the interaction strength or any other characteristics inherent to the system under study .",
    "next , a classical version of the sdm ( csdm ) has been also formulated in extensive @xcite and nonextensive @xcite classical statistical mechanics and applied to classical magnetic systems with short and long - range exchange interactions .",
    "the last method , strictly related to the classical two - time gf technique @xcite , offers a robust technical instrument for systematic and well tested nonperturbative approximations to explore the equilibrium and transport properties of classical many - body systems as well , parallel to the quantum counterpart .",
    "unfortunately , both the mentioned methods in the classical context have not received the due consideration and further developments and applications are desirable .    in this article , also with a pedagogical aim in mind , we first review the basic formalism of two - time gf s in classical statistical mechanics in a form strictly parallel to the quantum better known counterpart emphasizing the concept of spectral density ( sd ) , quite important for next purposes , and its relation to the two - time gf s .",
    "besides , as a convenient alternative to the emm for calculation of the gf s , the basic ingredients of the csdm are presented in some details , together with useful insights for systematic nonperturbative approximations .",
    "then , we clarify how this method can be conveniently used to explore macroscopic properties of classical many - body systems .",
    "we introduce also the key ideas for studying , in a conceptually transparent way , the elementary excitation spectrum , or dispersion relation , and the damping effects in a unified way within the formalism of csdm .",
    "the general presentation of the method in the classical many - body framework will be performed in a form strictly related to the well known quantum counterpart @xcite , giving the possibility to use powerful calculation techniques , approximation methods and the basic terminology which are typical of the quantum many - body theory .",
    "next , we will show , with explicit calculations , how the csdm works emphasizing its effectiveness already to the lowest order of approximation . as a nontrivial theoretical laboratory , we choose the classical @xmath0-dimensional spin-@xmath1 heisenberg ferromagnet with long - range interactions ( lri s ) , decaying as @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with distance @xmath4 between spins , in the presence of an external magnetic field . for this model",
    ", besides some partial exact results @xcite , a lot of new information about thermodynamic and critical properties have been obtained by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite . as we shall see , the csdm allows us to obtain , in a relatively simple way , untrivial results which appear to be in a reasonable agreement with the available exact ones and mc simulations supporting the sdm as a promising method of investigation also in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we introduce the two - time gf s and the related sd s in classical statistical mechanics for two arbitrary dynamic variables .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the methods of calculation focusing on the general formulation of the csdm . here",
    ", the method is properly implemented for exploring also the damping of the classical excitations within the same basic formalism .",
    "the method at work is presented in sec .",
    "4 with a study of the thermodynamic properties and the critical phenomena of the classical @xmath0-dimensional spin-@xmath1 heisenberg ferromagnetic model with lri s . here , after a summary of known theoretical and simulational information about the model for a next checking of the effectiveness of the csdm , we present explicit calculations performed by using the general many - body formalism developed before . as a successive useful comparison , we first formulate the problem in the context of the emm for the two - time gf s appropriate to the spin model under study and the basic equations in the tyablikov - like approximation ( classical version of the well known quantum tyablikov one @xcite ) are presented . then , the basic sd and related moment equations ( me s ) are derived , the thermodynamic and critical properties of the model are presented working in the so called one - pole approximation for the sd and a comparison with the tyablikov - like results is performed . to underline the effectiveness of this lowest order approximation and the nature of difficulties arising to higher orders , we deduce the basic equations for the two - poles approximation . as a further insight , we use the implemented csdm to obtain , in a unified and relatively simple way , the dispersion relation and the damping of classical spin excitations .",
    "explicit results are given ( for the short - range fm chain ) in the low - temperature limit . finally , in sec .",
    "5 some conclusions are drawn .",
    "in strict analogy with the quantum case @xcite , we define @xcite the two - time retarded @xmath5 and advanced @xmath6 gf s in classical statistical mechanics for two arbitrary dynamical variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the usual step function . in eq .",

    "can easily prove @xcite that the two - time gf s ( [ eq2.1 ] ) and the corresponding correlations functions depend on times @xmath15 , @xmath16 only through the difference @xmath17 .",
    "so , one can write @xmath18 in the previous equations , the dynamical variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 depend on time via the conjugate canonical coordinates @xmath19 , ( @xmath20 is the number of degrees of freedom of the classical system under study ) , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the liouville operator one finds also the alternative definition @xmath24 .",
    "however , the final conclusions remain unchanged . ] and @xmath25 is the hamiltonian . here , @xmath26 acts as a classical time - evolution operator which transforms the dynamical variable @xmath27 at the initial time @xmath28 into the dynamical variable @xmath29 at the arbitrary time @xmath15 .",
    "of course , the time evolution of the generic dynamical variable @xmath30 is governed by the well known liouville equation of motion ( em ) @xmath31    with the previous definitions , one can show @xcite that the two - time correlation function @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , is related to the classical gf s ( [ eq2.2 ] ) by the relation @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the temperature and @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "in particular , we have also @xmath38 which connects the poisson bracket of two dynamical variables and the corresponding dynamical correlation function .",
    "working , as assumed before , within equilibrium gibbs ensembles , one can introduce for @xmath39 and @xmath40 the fourier transforms @xmath41    @xmath42    where @xmath43 will be named the @xmath44-gf s of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the @xmath45-representation and @xmath46 is called the classical spectral intensity of the time - dependent correlation function @xmath40 , with @xmath47 . then , using eq .",
    "( [ eq2.4 ] ) and the integral representations@xmath48 for the step function and the dirac @xmath49-function , the fourier transforms of the two - time gf ( [ eq2.1 ] ) for two dynamical variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be expressed in terms of the corresponding spectral intensity as : @xmath50 where the symbol @xmath51 means @xmath52 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 if @xmath55 .",
    "it is interesting to compare eq .",
    "( [ eq2.9 ] ) with the quantum corresponding one for two operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 for definition of quantum two - time gf s with commutator or anticommutator , respectively , and @xmath59 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "notice that formally , as expected for internal consistency , the function @xmath60 or @xmath61 characterizes the classical or quantum nature of the problem under study , respectively .    in analogy to the quantum case @xcite",

    "( [ eq2.13 ] ) and ( [ eq2.14 ] ) assume a particular importance for our purposes .",
    "if one determines independently the @xmath65 , these equations allow us to obtain the time - dependent correlation and green functions and therefore the macroscopic properties of classical many - body systems",

    "combining now eqs .",

    "as in the quantum counterpart @xcite , using the definitions ( [ eq2.1 ] ) and ( [ eq2.2 ] ) , one can easily prove that @xmath73 and @xmath74 , analytically continued in the @xmath45-complex plane , are analytical functions in the upper and lower half - plane , respectively .",
    "then , combining these two analytical functions , one can construct a single function@xmath75 of complex @xmath45 such that @xmath76 hence , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.13 ] ) yields for @xmath77 the spectral representation @xmath78 this function is analytical in the whole complex @xmath45-plane with a cut along the real axis where singularities for @xmath77 may occur .",
    "it is worth noting that , in terms of @xmath65 , no formal differences exist for the spectral representations of @xmath79 and @xmath77 in the classical and quantum context .",
    "hence , all the developments already known in quantum many - body theory remain formally valid for the classical case .",

    "this allows us to state also that the cut for @xmath77 along the real axis in @xmath45-complex plane is determined by eq .",

    "2.2 we will derive a spectral decomposition for @xmath65 , and hence for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , from which it becomes possible to analyze the nature of the classical gf singularities and their connection with the physical quantities .      in this section",
    "we will show that , in strict analogy with quantum case , also in classical statistical mechanics an exact spectral decomposition for the csd is true . with this aim , following refs .",
    "@xcite , we introduce the hilbert space of the classical dynamical variables with a scalar product defined as @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the ( generalized ) partition function for the problem under study . in this space",
    "one can consider the eigenvalue equation for the hermitian operator @xmath94@xmath95 or , equivalently , in terms of the wave functions @xmath96 corresponding to the vectors @xmath97@xmath98 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.28 ] ) and ( [ eq2.29 ] ) , @xmath97 @xmath99 and @xmath100 denote the eigenvectors ( eigenfunctions ) and the eigenvalues of the liouville operator @xmath94 .",

    "it is worth noting that , in general , the @xmath49-poles in the exact classical lehmann representation ( [ eq2.31 ] ) of the spectral density are expected lying infinitesimally close , therewith defining a continuous function @xmath119 . it is then obvious that the damped oscillation concept works only under the basic presumption that the csd exhibits some pronounced peaks , which have to be identified with oscillation poles for @xmath120 .",

    "it is also worth pointing that the method provides the possibility to perform , systematically and in a transparent way , higher - order approximations with the aim to improve the results here presented .",
    "some suggestions along this direction , also for exploring the damping of the classical excitations , have been given in secs .",

    "<S> in this article we review a less known unperturbative and powerful many - body method in the framework of classical statistical mechanics and then we show how it works by means of explicit calculations for a nontrivial classical model . the formalism of two - time green functions in classical statistical mechanics </S>",
    "<S> is presented in a form parallel to the well known quantum counterpart , focusing on the spectral properties which involve the important concept of spectral density . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the general ingredients of the classical spectral density method ( csdm ) are presented with insights for systematic nonperturbative approximations to study conveniently the macroscopic properties of a wide variety of classical many - body systems also involving phase transitions . the method is implemented by means of key ideas for exploring the spectrum of elementary excitations and the damping effects within a unified formalism . </S>",
    "<S> then , the effectiveness of the csdm is tested with explicit calculations for the classical @xmath0-dimensional spin-@xmath1 heisenberg ferromagnetic model with long - range exchange interactions decaying as @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with distance @xmath4 between spins and in the presence of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the thermodynamic and critical properties , performed by means of the csdm to the lowest order of approximation , shows clearly that nontrivial results can be obtained in a relatively simple manner already to this lower stage . </S>",
    "<S> the basic spectral density equations for the next higher order level are also presented and the damping of elementary spin excitations in the low temperature regime is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the results appear in reasonable agreement with available exact ones and monte carlo simulations and this supports the csdm as a promising method of investigation in classical many - body theory . </S>"
