    "the variability of s  vulpeculae was first recognized in 1836 - 37 with an estimated cycle length of @xmath668 days .",
    "the star was at times classified as either semi - regular or rv tauri - type ( e.g. , joy 1952 ) .",
    "a study by nassau & ashbrook ( 1943 ) appears to be the first to identify the variations as those of a long - period cepheid .",
    "photoelectric studies by fernie ( 1970 ) and others ( berdnikov 1993 , 1994 ; heiser 1996 ) subsequently confirmed the cepheid nature of s  vul , making it the longest period classical cepheid recognized in the galaxy .",
    "a few other cepheid - like supergiants ( e.g. , v810  cen , hd  18391 ) have periods in excess of 100 days .",
    "like s  vul , they have small light amplitudes .    in the 1970s the possibility was raised that s  vul might be a member of the association vul ob2 ( tsarevskii 1971 ; turner 1980 ) , a link that would provide a means of establishing both the luminosity and intrinsic colour of s  vul from the distance and reddening of association stars . circa 1980",
    "the author noticed that s  vul lies in an anonymous open cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , now catalogued as turner  1 ( turner 1985 ) .",
    "a photometric study of the cluster was subsequently performed using photoelectric and photographic photometry ( turner et al .",
    "1986 ) , the latter calibrated using stars in the photoelectric sequence and secondary images offset by @xmath64@xmath7 from the primary images using a racine - pickering wedge on the 3.6-m canada - france - hawaii telescope . interpreting the photometry was complicated , but it was possible to isolate an old cluster of fg dwarfs @xmath6650 pc distant reddened by @xmath8 , as well as possible background b stars of larger reddening .",
    "the presence of the background group of b dwarfs was later confirmed from 2mass infrared photometry ( turner 2011 ) , but has not yet been studied using optical photometry .",
    "this paper attempts to rectify that omission .",
    "optical studies of reddening in galactic star fields are best done using johnson system _ ubv _ photometry , for which interstellar reddening is readily separated from other effects ( temperature , metallicity , etc . ) .",
    "u_-band observations are not yet available for the s  vul field , but the availability of _ bvg@xmath9r@xmath9i@xmath9 _ observations for the field from the aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ) provides a useful beginning . a comparison of previous photoelectric and photographic _ v_-band and _ b_-band data for the s  vul field with apass data is provided in the upper portion of fig .  [ fig2 ] . a similar comparison with _ bv _ data from the naval observatory merged astrometric dataset ( nomad , zacharias et al . 2005 )",
    "is shown in the lower portion of fig .",
    "nomad data are derived from scans of plates in the palomar observatory sky survey .",
    "the apass photometry is in excellent agreement with the turner et al .",
    "( 1986 ) photometry , except for three stars in the apass survey that may be affected by crowding .",
    "there is also a lack of apass data for many stars near s  vul within the apass limits , which may also be a result of image crowding .",
    "the next release of apass for the s  vul field may overcome such problems .",
    "the comparison of previous photoelectric and photographic _ v_-band and _ b_-band data for the s  vul field with nomad data reveals sizable systematic offsets , particularly in _",
    "b_. such offsets appear occasionally in other nomad fields and may be linked to the choice of calibration stars .",
    "it is possible to infer from the plots the main trend in the data in order to correct the nomad results for s  vul stars for the calibration error . but correcting the resulting nomad _ b  v _ colours to the photoelectric system is rather complicated . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is a comparison of the adjusted nomad _ b  v _ colours with the photoelectric and photographic colours in the survey of turner et al .",
    "the adopted trend relation ( not shown ) depends significantly upon how many of the most discrepant stars are omitted from the fit .",
    "analysis of the combined photoelectric and photographic ubv , apass bv ccd , and nomad bv observations is involved , but a solution was found .",
    "data from the various sources were assigned weights depending upon the expected precision , with highest weights for the photoelectric observations , medium weights for the ccd and photographic _ bv _ observations , and low weights for the nomad _ bv _ data .",
    "the _ u_-band data from the turner et al .",
    "( 1986 ) study were adopted as given . in other words ,",
    "the apass and nomad data were used to improve the _ v_-magnitudes and _ b  v _ colours for stars in the turner et al .",
    "( 1986 ) study , as well as to add _ bv _ data for faint stars lying beyond its spatial and magnitude limits .",

    "[ fig4 ] .    the reddening relation for the field of s  vul",
    "is well established from previous studies ( turner 1980 , 1989 ) to be described by the relation @xmath10 , which has been approximated by @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . as found previously ( turner et al .",
    "1986 ) , most stars in turner  1 are fg dwarfs reddened by @xmath12 . a best fit by eye to the data of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] yields a mean reddening of @xmath1 for the fg dwarfs , where the uncertainty represents scatter arising from differential reddening in the field ( turner 1980 ) , uncertainties in the observations , and unknown corrections for ultraviolet excesses in the g dwarfs resulting from line blanketing ( wildey et al .",
    "there is also a relatively clear sequence of b dwarfs reddened by @xmath4 that represents background stars detected beyond the foreground cluster .",
    "since the stars are dispersed across the field , the scatter in their reddenings may also arise from the small amount of differential reddening in the field .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagram for the stars in turner  1 can be interpreted with the established reddenings of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] presents the colour - magnitude diagram for the analyzed stars using a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) for the smaller reddening of @xmath13 .",
    "the zams matches the lower envelope of fg stars at @xmath14 . with the adopted reddening ,",
    "the intrinsic distance modulus is @xmath15 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath0 kpc . that is larger than the value of 643 pc found in the study by turner et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , the difference being accounted for by the fainter stars added here to the zams for the cluster .",
    "an age isochrone for @xmath16 also provides a good fit to the evolved portion of the main sequence , as well as to a putative group of g giant members in fig .",
    "the eye fit to the data is limited by the mixed quality of the photometry .",

    ".intrinsic parameters for s  vulpeculae . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    the sequence of faint , reddened b dwarfs displays no degree of concentration towards the centre of turner  1 , so must represent a sparse clumping of young stars along the line of sight to the cepheid .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in a study of the field that made use of 2mass observations ( turner 2011 ) .",
    "the average reddening of @xmath4 for these stars must also apply to the cepheid , in which case its stellar reddening becomes @xmath17 according to the relationship of fernie ( 1970 ) .",
    "if s  vul is a member of the same group , as seems likely , it has an inferred luminosity of @xmath18 .",
    "other properties of s  vul as a likely member of the background group of b stars are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the consistency of the derived luminosity of s  vul with those of other calibrating cepheids is seen in its absolute spitzer @xmath19 m magnitude ( [ 3.6 ] ) in fig .",

    "similar results apply to the spitzer @xmath20 m magnitude .",
    "similar conclusions are reached if one compares the implied mass and age of s  vul with empirical values derived for cluster cepheids .",
    "a preliminary study of such characteristics by turner ( 1996 ) has been updated in table  [ tab2 ] using new results for cepheids and cepheid - like supergiants associated with open clusters ( turner 2010 ; turner et al .",
    "2009 , 2012a , 2012b ; majaess et al .",
    "2013 ) . included are results for two red supergiant variables associated with open clusters : bc  cyg in berkeley  87 and @xmath21 cep in trumpler  37 .",
    "dynamical masses have been derived for three cepheids in binary systems ( evans et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ; pietrzyski et al .",
    "2010 ) , while evolutionary masses have been deduced for cepheids and cepheid - like objects in clusters using @xmath22 , the mass of stars at the red edge of the tip of the evolved main sequence , i.e. , stars in the terminal stages of core hydrogen burning prior to the first crossing of the instability strip , as inferred from the models of meynet et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . in the study by turner ( 1996 ) the evolutionary masses of cluster cepheids were assumed to be roughly 10% larger than values of @xmath22 , but the close coincidence in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] of @xmath22 evolutionary masses with dynamical masses for binary cepheids suggests that the two estimates may be almost identical ( see also turner 2012 ) .",
    "the evolutionary stages of shell hydrogen burning and core helium burning therefore occur on significantly shorter time scales than is the case for core hydrogen burning in stars .",
    "the implied evolutionary mass of s  vul from its association with ba stars in its vicinity closely agrees with evolutionary masses deduced for other cluster cepheids ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "a similar result is found for the empirical cepheid period - age relation , as deduced for cluster cepheids and pulsating red supergiants in table  [ tab2 ] and plotted in fig .",
    "the pulsation periods used in table  [ tab2 ] and plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] ,  [ fig8 ] , and  [ fig9 ] are those for fundamental mode pulsation .",
    "the review by turner ( 2012 ) and other studies of the cepheid period - age correlation assume that the relationship is linear , but the results of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] suggest that the relationship may be non - linear for high - mass pulsators .",
    "such non - linearity depends upon how closely red supergiant pulsators resemble normal cepheids .",
    "fundamental properties have been deduced for s  vul from its likely association with a group of b stars in its immediate vicinity .",
    "all derived parameters for the cepheid are consistent with its membership in the loose group of b stars , but confirmation must await a deeper _ ubv _ study of stars surrounding the cepheid and measurement of radial velocities for brighter association members .",
    "preliminary measurements have already been made of potential candidates using the plaskett telescope at the dominion astrophysical observatory : older measurements from the 1980s by doug welch ( unpublished ) , and more recent ccd observations .",
    "results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the location of s  vul at the extreme long - period end of the leavitt relation for classical cepheids makes it extremely valuable for anchoring the slope of the relationship , so further study is essential .",
