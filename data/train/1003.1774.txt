    "the central task in the study of quantum many - body systems is the classification of possible phases of matter and the understanding of phase transitions between them . of particular interest",
    "is the study of systems at zero temperature , where a whole new realm of quantum effects emerge , and that is what we will focus on in this paper .",
    "landau s general principle for understanding continuous phase transitions based on symmetry breaking and local order parameter @xcite does not apply to all phases and phase transitions .",
    "topological order,@xcite in particular , is not related to any symmetry properties and topological phase transitions may happen between systems with the same @xcite or incompatible @xcite symmetries .",
    "it has been the subject of intensive research and will be the central topic of this paper . aside from the lack of a qualitative understanding , what makes the problem harder",
    "is the fact that for quantum systems whose components strongly interact with each other , direct numerical approach is limited due to strong entanglement among the particles . generically , the space required for description of a quantum system grows exponentially with system size , hence limiting direct numerical simulations to systems usually too small for any practical purpose .",
    "recently , insights into quantum many - body systems from both condensed matter physics and quantum information science have led to the discovery of the tensor product representation of quantum states ( also called the projected entangled pair states)@xcite , which provides a promising variational approach to study zero temperature quantum phase and phase transitions . representing quantum many - body states with a network of tensors , tensor product states ( tps )",
    "are proven to be efficient for the study of one dimensional quantum systems@xcite .",
    "the higher dimensional generalization of this approach may not be as efficient , yet study has shown that it reproduces many known results and may reveal new features in systems not solvable in any conventional way@xcite .",
    "the strength of the approach lies in the fact tps can describe long range entanglement that are present in a large class of topologically ordered states.@xcite so the variational approach based on tps can include both topologically ordered states and symmetry breaking states and can produce a phase diagram that contains both types of states .",
    "in contrast , the conventional mean - field / variational approaches are based on states with no long range entanglement , which exclude the topologically ordered states from the very beginning .",
    "we also note that the entanglement of a simple tps satisfies an area law@xcite , which coincides with the scaling of entanglement in the ground state of most known non - critical systems@xcite .    in the variational approach based on tps",
    ", we try to find a tps which minimizes the average energy of a local hamiltonian . as we change the hamiltonian by adding perturbation , the tensors in the tps",
    "are also changed in order to minimize the average energy for the new hamiltonian .",
    "while local physical perturbations can always be reflected by variations in the tensors , the other direction of this problem remains unclear : can an arbitrary variation of the tensor be induced by a local perturbation of the hamiltonian ?",
    "this is a very important question if we want to discuss phase based on states . because phase is defined as a region in hamiltonian space , where any two points @xmath1 , @xmath2 within the region can be connected by a smooth path without encounter singularities ( _ i.e. _ phase transitions )",
    ". so the question about tensor and phase becomes , which set of states in hilbert space correspond to such a region in hamiltonian space and which set of tensors in the tensor space represent these states .",
    "starting from one point in the phase region , we would like to know what kind of variations in the tensors correspond to local perturbations to the hamiltonian .",
    "we can discuss this important question in more concrete setting .",
    "assume a tps @xmath3 minimizing the average energy of a hamiltonian @xmath4 has a property .",
    "we would like to ask if the property is a universal property of a phase , or just a special property of @xmath4 .",
    "if the property is a universal property of a phase , then the ground state @xmath5 for the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath6 still has the same property . if the property is a special property of @xmath4 , the ground state for the perturbed hamiltonian will lose this property .",
    "it is the collection of universal properties that defines a phase .",
    "so a study of universal properties is a study of phases .",
    "if all the variations of the tensors can be induced by local perturbations of the hamiltonian , then we can study the stability of a property against local perturbation @xmath7 of the hamiltonian by studying the stability of a property against variations of the tensors .",
    "this will give us a powerful tool to study phases using tps .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that not all variations of the tensors can be induced by local perturbations of the hamiltonian , as we show in this paper . for a generic tps , which satisfies a condition called injectivity @xcite",
    ", tensor variations indeed correspond to hamiltonian perturbations . however , this is not true in the general case , as we show in this paper with a special system with topological order .",
    "so it is not easy to study universal properties and phases using tps . in order to use tps to study phases and phases transitions ,",
    "we need to find the subset of variations in tensors that are physical , _",
    "i.e. _ corresponding to local perturbations of the hamiltonian .    for clarity , we will always refer to small changes in the hamiltonian as ` perturbation ' and to those in the tensors as ` variation ' . without any efficient method to solve for exact tps representation of ground states of quantum many - body systems , finding",
    "the subset of the variations of the tensors that can be induced by local perturbation of hamiltonian is in general very difficult .",
    "we want to , in particular , study this problem for topologically ordered phases . as tps can give a simple description of a large class of topological ordered states",
    ", we expect that it might provide a powerful tool for studying topological phases in general .",
    "as we know , topologically ordered phases are proven to be stable against any local perturbations of the hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "that is , the topological properties , such as ground state degeneracy@xcite and quasi - particle statistics@xcite , are robust under any local perturbation to the hamiltonian .",
    "so in the tps approach to topologically ordered phase , it is natural to ask : are those topological properties robust against any variation of tensors , that is , for any tensor which represents a topologically ordered state , is the topological order robust against arbitrary variation in the tensors ?",
    "surprisingly , we find that this is not true .",
    "we focus on the @xmath0 topological order represented by an ideal tps in this paper and study how the topological order of the state changes as we vary certain parameters in the representing tensors .",
    "we characterize topological order by calculating the topological entanglement entropy @xmath8 @xcite for the state and observe that topological order ( _ i.e. _ the topological entanglement entropy @xmath8 ) is stable only against variations of the tensors that preserve certain @xmath0 symmetry of the tensors .",
    "since the topological order is robust against any local perturbations of hamiltonian , this result shows that not all variations of the tensors correspond to local perturbations of hamiltonian . for this @xmath0 model , we show that in the generic case @xmath0 symmetry is a necessary condition for the variations in tensors to correspond to physical perturbations of the hamiltonian .",
    "this claim is further supported by checking stability of the topological renyi entropy of tps with @xmath0 symmetry preserving variations and @xmath0 symmetry breaking variations of the tensors respectively .",
    "while calculating @xmath8 for a general state is exponentially hard@xcite , we find efficient ways to do so for two sets of tps near the ideal tps with @xmath0 topological order .",
    "for a general tps , we calculate the topological renyi entropy by mapping it to the contraction of a 2d tensor network , which is accomplished by using the tensor entanglement renormalization algorithm@xcite .",
    "hence we are able to calculate topological entropy for regions much larger than was possible previously and determine the topological order of the state more accurately .    our result on the stability of",
    "topological order will help us in the tps based variational approach to @xmath0 topological phase : we should only consider the variations of the tensors within the subspace of tensors with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry condition and possibly other conditions will help us to understand the physical variations of tensors in tps .",
    "this is crucial in using tps to study quantum phases and quantum phase transitions .",
    "it may even lead to a classification of topological order .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by introducing an ` ideal ' lattice spin model with @xmath0 topological order and show how the presence of topological order in the ground state wave function can be understood nicely with a physical mechanism called ` string - net condensation ' .",
    "such a physical picture naturally gives rise to a simple tensor product representation of the wave function , to which we then add two kinds of local variations , ` string tension ' and ` end of strings ' . by calculating topological entanglement entropy numerically for the first case and analytically for the second case ,",
    "we show how topological order is stable against @xmath0 preserving variations ( ` string tension ' ) , but breaks down immediately when @xmath0 symmetry is broken ( by ` end of strings ' ) .",
    "we then randomly picked  200 tensors in the neighborhood of the ideal @xmath0 tps and calculate the topological renyi entropy of the corresponding states .",
    "tensors with and without @xmath0 symmetry demonstrate totally different behavior as system size scales up .",
    "we discuss in the last section the implications of our findings in variational studies of topological phase and phase transitions .",
    "the details of the calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "we start from an exactly solvable model which has @xmath0 topological order@xcite . in this section , we give the system hamiltonian , find the ground state wave function and explain its structure and how that leads to a nontrivial topological order which can be detected with topological entanglement entropy . with these insights about the state",
    "we then present a simple tensor product representation of this wave function .",
    "the model is defined on a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice where each link is occupied by a qubit ( spin-@xmath9 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is a sum of commuting projection operators @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 are qubit pauli operators defined as @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 stands for each hexagon plaquette in the lattice and @xmath15 is the tensor product of six @xmath11 operators around the plaquette .",
    "@xmath16 stands for each vertex and @xmath17 is the tensor product of three @xmath12 operators connected to the vertex .",
    "the ground state wave function has a nice interpretation using the ` string - net ' picture where state @xmath18 corresponds to no string on a link and state @xmath19 corresponds to the presence of a string .",
    "the vertex term @xmath17 enforces that there are even number of strings connected to each vertex and hence the strings form closed loop while the plaquette term @xmath20 gives dynamics to the closed loops .",
    "the ground state wave function is an equal weight superposition of all closed loop configurations on the lattice .",
    "@xmath21 the normalization factor is omitted .",
    "if we refer to each closed loop configuration as a string - net , the appearance of @xmath0 topological order in this system has then a natural interpretation as being due to the condensation of string - nets .",
    "we will refer to this model as the ideal @xmath0 model .",
    "model can be defined on this lattice and the red , yellow , blue sets of qubits correspond respectively to the plaquette , vertex , and link terms in the @xmath0 hamiltonian.,width=240 ]    for simplicity of discussion , we split each qubit on a link into two qubits as illustrated in fig [ fig : hex ] .",
    "the string - net condensed @xmath0 wave function on the original lattice can be naturally extended to a state on the new lattice by replacing a @xmath22 link with @xmath23 and a @xmath24 link with @xmath25 .",
    "this new state is still an equal weight superposition of all string - nets and hence maintains the @xmath0 topological order .",
    "the new system hamiltonian can be obtained from the old one by adding a @xmath26 term to each link and expand the plaquette term into a product of @xmath11 operators on all twelve qubits around the plaquette @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes all the links and @xmath29 are the two qubits on the link .",
    "it is easy to see that the new hamiltonian indeed has the new string - net condensed state as its ground state .",
    "the topological order of the system can be detected from the ground state wave function by calculating the topological entanglement entropy of the state .",
    "the mapping to the new lattice allows this calculation to be carried out exactly in a few steps , as illustrated below .    according to the definition of topological entanglement entropy in ref .",
    "( or equivalently defined in ref . ) , we take out a simply connected region from the whole lattice and divide it into three parts @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 as shown in fig [ fig : hex ] . by calculating the entanglement entropy for regions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and combining them according to @xmath37 we arrive at the topological entanglement entropy @xmath8 of the state .",
    "the above definition needs to be applied to regions much larger than the correlation length of the state . for the state in consideration ,",
    "the correlation length is zero and the calculation gives the right result for whatever regions we take .",
    "we divide the regions by cutting through the pair of qubits on boundary links as illustrated in fig [ fig : hex ] . for a region with @xmath38 outgoing links on the boundary , there are @xmath39 orthogonal boundary configurations due to the closed loop constraint of the wave function .",
    "tracing out each boundary configuration contributes equally and independently to the entropy of the region and hence @xmath40 , which includes one term proportional to the length of the boundary @xmath38 and one constant term @xmath41 .",
    "the combination in the definition of @xmath8 makes sure that the boundary terms of different regions cancel out with each other , so topological entanglement entropy for the state is then @xmath42 .",

    "the eight tensors are : @xmath52}(000 ) = 1 & t_{[011]}(011 ) = 1 \\\\ t_{[101]}(101 ) = 1 & t_{[110]}(110 ) = 1 \\\\ \\text{all other terms are zero } \\end{array } \\label{tps_z2}\\ ] ] the physical indices @xmath53 $ ] correspond to the out - of - plane gray links in fig [ fig : tps ] .",

    "it can then be checked that only string - net configurations have non - zero amplitude in this representation and the amplitude are actually all equal .",
    "therefore , the tensors given in [ tps_z2 ] indeed represent a string - net condensed state  the ideal @xmath0 ground state .",
    "this set of tensors serves as a starting point for our variational study of topological phase transitions and we wish to know what kind of variations of the tensors correspond to physical perturbations of the hamiltonian .",
    "we will study first two specific cases in the following two sections .",
    "suppose that we want to know how magnetic field in the @xmath12 direction might affect topological order .",
    "the perturbed hamiltonian reads : @xmath55 the @xmath56 term commute with the vertex and link term @xmath17 , @xmath57 in the unperturbed hamiltonian , so the closed loop constraint is maintained .",
    "the ground state wave function is still a superposition of string - net configurations , but with different weight .",

    "@xmath58 where the summation is over all string - net configurations and @xmath59 is the total string length of a configuration .",
    "this weighted superposition can still have a simple tensor product representation by locally modifying the tensors in eq.[tps_z2 ] to @xmath60}(000 ) = g & t_{[011]}(011 ) = 1 \\\\ t_{[101]}(101 ) = 1 & t_{[110]}(110 ) = 1 \\\\ \\text{all other terms are zero } \\end{array } \\label{tps_z2_g}\\ ] ] for @xmath61 , the weight of each string segment is smaller by a factor of @xmath62 than that of no string , lowering the weight of string - net configurations exponentially .",
    "physically , we can imagine this is due to some kind of tension in the strings .",

    ", we can actually find the corresponding perturbations explicitly .",
    "the relation we mentioned above between the @xmath0 state with string tension and 2d classical ising model at finite temperature allows the construction of a continuous family of parent hamiltonian @xmath76 for the quantum states@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath76 is local , has the state @xmath77 as its exact ground state and remains gapped for @xmath78 .",

    "therefore , a change in @xmath163-igg will in general represent a change in topological order . apart from @xmath163-igg , the tensors might also have lower dimensional igg s .",

    "however , we believe that such lower dimensional igg s are not related to the topological order in two dimension and breaking them will not lead to a change in topological order .    note that in order to use @xmath168-igg of a tensor network to decide topological order , we only require that the network is composed of patches of tensors which are invariant under certain gauge transformations .",
    "it is not necessary that every single tensor is @xmath168-igg invariant .",
    "however , in the generic case , if the single tensors do not have special symmetry structure , it is not possible to have @xmath163-igg invariance on a bigger patch . as discussed in ref .",
    ", such a tensor network will generically satisfy a condition called ` injectivity ' , i.e. for a large enough region in the network , when the single tensors are contracted together to form a new tensor , the set of tensor vectors labeled by their physical indices will span the full tensor space of the @xmath38 outgoing inner indices of the region .",
    "therefore , the tensor network can not have nontrivial @xmath163-igg . in order for a bigger patch in the network to have @xmath163-igg invariance , it is in general necessary for every tensor to be @xmath163-igg invariant .",
    "hence , we believe that the invariance of every tensor under @xmath163-igg is a more general necessary conditions for generic variations of the tensor to correspond to physical perturbations of the hamiltonian . breaking of the @xmath163-igg invariance of the tensors will in general correspond to a change in topological order . therefore in a numerical variational calculation",
