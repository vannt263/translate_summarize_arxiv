    "the past decade has seen the discovery of over 150 exoplanets ( http://www.obspm.fr/planets ) .",
    "one statistical trend that has emerged from these data is that the probability of finding a gas giant planet around a star with current techniques increases with the host star s metallicity @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the high metal content of planet host stars seems to be primordial .",
    "therefore , this trend , if real @xcite , indicates that short - period gas giant planets are more likely to occur in metal - rich than in metal - poor protoplanetary disks .",
    "the two contending theories for gas giant formation are core accretion plus gas capture @xcite and disk instability @xcite .",
    "calculations show that the metallicity relation can be explained within the framework of core accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for disk instability",
    ", @xcite finds that , in his three - dimensional hydrodynamics disk simulations with radiative cooling , clump formation by disk instability occurs for all metallicities over the range 0.1 to 10 z@xmath0 , due to rapid cooling by convection @xcite , and he attributes the abundance of short period gas giants around high metallicity stars to migration @xcite , a mechanism also invoked by @xcite to explain part of the metallicity correlation . by contrast , @xcite , who uses a somewhat more sophisticated treatment of radiative boundary conditions , finds much longer cooling times and no fragmentation into dense clumps in her disk instability simulations . here",
    "we report results of new disk calculations based on meja s methods in which the opacity is varied by using different metallicities and grain sizes . even over a much narrower range of metallicities than considered by @xcite , we find that the strength of the gi s does vary noticeably and that disk fragmentation is not seen for any metallicity or grain size tested .",
    "we conduct protoplanetary disk simulations using the indiana university hydrodynamics group code ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which solves the equations of hydrodynamics in conservative form on a cylindrical grid @xmath1 to second order in space and time using an ideal gas equation of state .",
    "self - gravity and shock mediation by artificial bulk viscosity are included .",
    "reflection symmetry is assumed about the equatorial plane , and free outflow boundaries are used along the top , outer , and inner edges of the grid .",
    "we adopt the treatment of radiative physics detailed in @xcite with few modifications .",
    "let @xmath2 be the optical depth , defined by using the rosseland mean opacity measured vertically down from above .",
    "energy flow in cells with @xmath3 is calculated in all three directions using flux - limited diffusion @xcite .",
    "cells with @xmath4 2/3 , in the disk atmosphere and in the outer disk , cool radiatively using an optically thin lte emissivity .",
    "atmosphere heating by high - altitude shocks and upward moving photons from the photosphere are included . in this paper",
    ", we also assume that an external envelope heated by the star @xcite shines vertically down on the disk .",
    "this ir irradiation is characterized by a black body flux with a temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the optically thick and thin regions are coupled , over one or two cells , by an eddington - like grey atmosphere fit that defines the boundary flux for the diffusion approximation .",
    "the opacities and molecular weights for a solar composition are from @xcite , with a power - law grain size distribution of @xmath6 ranging from 0.005 @xmath7 m to a largest grain size @xmath8 that can be varied . to model variations in metallicity z , the mean opacities",
    "are multiplied by a factor @xmath9 z / z@xmath0 , as was done by @xcite .",
    "tests of our radiative scheme for a vertically stratified gas layer with a constant gravity , a constant input flux at the base , and a grey opacity show relaxation to an eddington - like solution with the correct flux from the photospheric layers .",
    "the initial axisymmetric model for all the calculations is the same as that used by @xcite .",
    "the central star is 0.5 @xmath10 , and the nearly keplerian disk of 0.07 @xmath10 has a surface density @xmath11 from 2.3 au to 40 au .",
    "the initial grid has ( 256 , 128 , 32 ) cells in ( @xmath12 ) above the midplane .",
    "when the disk expands at the onset of gi s , the grid is extended radially and vertically .",
    "the initial minimum value of the toomre stability parameter @xmath13 is about 1.5 , and so the disk is marginally unstable to gi s .",
    "the initial model is seeded with low - amplitude random density noise .",
    "we use @xmath14 k , which is lower than the 50 k assumed in @xcite because our larger and less massive disk is mostly stabilized by @xmath15 k. in this paper , we present simulations with four metallicities z = 1/4 z@xmath16 ( one - quarter solar metallicity ) , 1/2 z@xmath16 , z@xmath16 , and 2 z@xmath16 .",
    "the 1/4 z@xmath16 simulation was started from the 1/2 z@xmath16 disk after 13.0 outer rotation periods ( orps ) of evolution , to save computing resources . here",
    "1 orp ( about 250 yrs ) is the initial rotation period at 33 au .",
    "the varied metallicity cases use a maximum grain size @xmath17 m in the dust opacities . an additional simulation with @xmath18 mm and z = z@xmath0",
    "is conducted to explore the effects of grain growth .",
    "the current calculations resemble those presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the disks remain fairly axisymmetric until a _ burst phase _ of rapid growth in nonaxisymmetric structure .",
    "subsequently , the disks gradually transition into a quasi - steady _ asymptotic phase _",
    ", where heating and cooling are in rough balance , and average quantities change slowly ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "table [ comparetable ] summarizes some of the results . in the table",
    ", duration refers to the simulation length measured in orps , @xmath19 is the time in orps at which the burst phase begins , @xmath20 is the approximate time in orps when the simulation enters the asymptotic state , @xmath21 is a time - averaged integrated fourier amplitude for all nonaxisymmetric structure ( see below ) , @xmath22 is the final global cooling time obtained by dividing the final total internal energy of the disk by the final total luminosity , and thin@xmath23 is the percentage of disk volume that is optically thin during the asymptotic phase .",
    "one noticeable effect is that the onset of the burst phase ( @xmath19 ) is delayed for higher metallicity and larger grain size ( table [ comparetable ] ) , as expected due to higher opacity and therefore slower cooling .",
    "note that , over the bulk of our large cool disk , increasing @xmath8 increases the opacity .",
    "although the time to reach the asymptotic phase is relatively insensitive to grain size and metallicity , the overall final @xmath22 listed in table [ comparetable ] illustrates that the correlation between cooling time and opacity carries over to late times . during the asymptotic phase , in all cases ,",
    "the toomre @xmath13 values remain roughly constant with time , with values ranging between 1.3 to 1.8 for @xmath24 10 to 40 au , and the mass inflow rates peak near 15 au at @xmath25/yr , with negligible difference between 1/2 z@xmath0 and 2 z@xmath0 to the accuracy that we can measure these inflows @xcite . although there are some regions of superadiabatic gradients , the rapid overall convective cooling reported by @xcite does not occur",
    ". we do see upward and downward motions , which we attribute to hydraulic jumps @xcite .",
    "whether or not some of these motions are actually thermal convection , they do not result in rapid cooling for our disks .    in figure [ den ] , which shows midplane densities at 15 orps , the spiral structure appears stronger for 1/4 z@xmath16 than for 2 z@xmath16 . in order to quantify differences in gi strength ,",
    "we compute integrated fourier amplitudes",
    "@xcite    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the axisymmetric component of the density and @xmath28 is the amplitude of the cos(@xmath29 ) component .",
    "although variable , after @xmath30 14 orps , the @xmath31 s for most @xmath32 s are greater for 1/4 z@xmath16 than for higher z s .",
    "to measure total nonaxisymmetry , we sum the @xmath31 s and average this sum over 14.5 to 15.5 orps .",
    "as shown in table [ comparetable ] , this global measure @xmath21 is greatest for 1/4 z@xmath16 and generally decreases with increasing metallicity and grain size .",
    "figure [ energy ] plots the cumulative energy loss due to cooling computed for only half the disk as a function of time .",
    "the upper curves show energy loss from the disk interior after compensating for energy input by residual irradiation and by the glowing disk upper atmosphere ; the lower curves show net energy loss from optically thin regions after accounting for heating due to envelope irradiation . due to our restricted vertical resolution and use of the eddington atmosphere fit over one or two vertical cells ,",
    "the `` thick '' curves effectively include most of the photospheric layers for most columns through the disk .",
    "the `` thin '' curves tally additional cooling from extended layers above the photospheric cells , usually with @xmath33 , plus the parts of the outer disk that are optically thin all the way to the midplane .",
    "the initial cooling rates for the optically thick regions plus photosphere clearly differ .",
    "in fact , the initial slopes of the `` thick '' curves give @xmath34 z / z@xmath0 orps .",
    "however , the initial disks are far from radiatively relaxed , and so there are transients . remarkably , by the asymptotic phase , all the disk interior - plus - photosphere curves converge to similar energy loss rates . during these late times , the differences between the total cooling rates are dominated by the optically thin regions , which are larger for the lower metallicity cases , as indicated by the thin@xmath23 entry in table [ comparetable ] . the overall asymptotic phase @xmath22 s in table [ comparetable ] , based on summing the thick and thin loss rates , are longer for higher metallicity and larger grain size .",
    "altogether , the evidence in table [ comparetable ] and figures [ den ] and [ energy ] shows that higher opacity leads to slower cooling and that slower cooling produces lower gi amplitudes .",
    "we remind the reader that we detect these differences over a much narrower range of metallicities ( 1/4 to 2 z@xmath0 ) than considered by @xcite ( 0.1 to 10 z@xmath0 ) .    as in @xcite , except for brief transients during the burst phases of some runs , these disks do not form dense clumps , in apparent disagreement with @xcite . to investigate whether the disk evolution depends on spatial resolution in the asymptotic phase @xcite , both the 1/4 z@xmath0 and 2 z@xmath0 simulations",
    "are extended for another 2 orp s with quadrupled azimuthal resolution ( 512 zones ) , and the disks do not fragment into dense clumps .",
    "this is consistent with the analytic arguments in @xcite that an unstable disk and fast radiative cooling are incompatible constraints for realistic disks at 10 au ( see boss 2005 for a different perspective ) . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath22 listed in table  [ comparetable ] is a good measure of local cooling times in these disks , we do not expect fragmentation .",
    "@xcite shows that fragmentation occurs only if the local @xmath22 is less than about half the local disk orbit period @xmath35 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except possibly near sharp opacity edges @xcite .",
    "we only find locallized cooling times shorter than 0.5 @xmath35 in the asymptotic phase of the 2 z@xmath0 case , and then only in the 30 to 40 au region , which is optically thin .",
    "this occurs because , even though @xmath36 z in optically thick regions ( higher optical depth ) , @xmath36 z@xmath37 in thin ones ( more emitters ) . as a result",
    ", this disk displays the steepest drop of local @xmath22 with @xmath38 .",
    "the short local @xmath22 s appear to be highly variable and transient .",
    "the continuation of this simulation for 2 orps at higher azimuthal resolution ( 512 zones ) does not show evidence for fragmentation into clumps .",
    "it could prove important to push our simulations to higher z in the future .",
    "our results show that gi strength decreases as metallicity increases and , contrary to @xcite , that global radiative cooling is too slow for fragmentation into dense clumps . in the asymptotic phase , cooling rates for the disk interior plus photospheric layers converge for all z , but the total cooling , including the optically thin regions , is higher for lower z. thus , the optically thin upper atmosphere and outer disk play a role in the cooling rate of an evolved disk .",
    "in fact , the fractional volume of the optically thin regions becomes very large at late times ( see thin@xmath23 in table [ comparetable ] ) .",
    "note also that the optically thick region fractional volume , @xmath39 , varies roughly as z. the greater surface area of the disk photosphere at higher z tends to compensate for the higher opacity and leads to convergence of the cooling rates for the parts of the disk contained within the photospheric layers . in this respect ,",
    "we confirm boss s conclusion that the outcome of the radiative evolution is somewhat insensitive to metallicity .",
    "however , the important difference is that we do not see fragmentation into dense clumps , presumably because our cooling rates are much lower than in @xcite .",
    "for the 1 mm case , the optically thin regions have a much smaller volume ( table 1 ) and contribute little to cooling . outside the inner few au ,",
    "bigger grains make the disk more opaque to longer wavelengths , and @xmath22 is thus considerably larger , even initially .",
    "our results argue against direct formation of gas giants by disk instability in two ways  the global radiative cooling times seem too long for fragmentation to occur and gi s are stronger overall for _ lower _ metallicity . nevertheless , it is still possible that gi s play an important role in gas giant planet formation .",
    "@xcite suggest that dense gas rings produced by gi s will enhance the growth rate of solid cores by drawing solids toward their centers @xcite and thereby accelerating core accretion .",
    "such rings are indeed produced in the inner disks of all our calculations regardless of metallicity or grain size , and they appear to be still growing when the calculations end . in the weaker gi environments of high metallicity , there is less self - gravitating turbulence to interfere with the radial drift of solids @xcite . in this way",
    ", rings may provide a natural shelter and gathering place for growing embryos and cores .    the apparent disagreement between our results and",
    "those of @xcite could be due to any number of differences in techniques and assumptions , such as artificial viscosity , opacities , equations of state , initial disk models and perturbations , grid shapes and resolution , and radiative boundary conditions , including the way that we handle irradiation .",
    "we are now collaborating with boss in an effort to pinpoint which of these is the principal cause ( k. cai et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "preliminary results suggest that it is the radiative boundary conditions .",
    "we are therefore developing alternative techniques for disk radiative transfer that we hope are more reliable and accurate .",
