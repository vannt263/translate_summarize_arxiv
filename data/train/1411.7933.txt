    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : ( i ) we propose an experimentally feasible implementation based on trapped ions for a variety of famous np - complete problems .",
    "we show how controlled noise can be engineered in such setups .",
    "this , in combination with large intrinsic coherence times and precise control , enables a systematic study of how decoherence influences entanglement and efficiency in aqo protocols .",
    "( ii ) we perform a theoretical analysis of the role of entanglement in aqo .",
    "we numerically study its interrelation with the success probability , and we analytically show that the entanglement entropy provides an upper bound for the success probability .",
    "a key question that becomes accessible in the proposed trapped - ion setup is how entanglement , decoherence , and non - adiabaticity on the one side connect to the efficiency on the other side .",
    "our findings , obtained from exact numerical calculations , suggest that entanglement in the final state can reveal information about the efficiency of the protocol .",
    "we derive a universal upper bound that allows for an efficient estimation of the success probability from the final - state entanglement .",
    "moreover , we find that the maximal entanglement during the sweep is rather uncorrelated with the success probability .",
    "note that the goal of this paper is not to suggest a scalable quantum - annealing device that could compete with system sizes of a d - wave machine @xcite , but rather a well - controlled implementation that allows one to study the fundamentals of aqo .",
    "the basic idea behind aqo is to utilize quantum adiabaticity for solving hard optimization problems that can be encoded in couplings @xmath2 and weights @xmath5 of a classical ising hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , denote pauli matrices .",
    "the interaction matrix @xmath2 and the magnetic fields @xmath5 are chosen such that the ground state of @xmath9 is the optimal solution of the original problem .",
    "to arrive at the final ground state , aqo employs an adiabatic sweep starting from a simple to prepare ground state of some @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xmath11 with all spins initially polarized along the @xmath12 direction ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is then deformed adiabatically such that @xmath13 after the annealing time @xmath14 .",

    "if the ramp is sufficiently slow , according to the adiabatic theorem , the system will remain at all times in the ground state and the state at @xmath19 is the solution of the optimization problem .",
    "this procedure is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "it is in spirit very similar to adiabatic state preparation , where one seeks to reach the ground state of a quantum many - body hamiltonian via a ramp as eq .  .",
    "first steps in this direction have already been done in a trapped - ion setup @xcite .",
    "here , in contrast one seeks to employ quantum fluctuations for solving a classical optimization problem .",
    "the aqo scheme becomes particularly appealing for complex problems where @xmath9 is characterized by a high roughness of the free - energy landscape .",
    "such problems are equivalent to spin glasses , where classical annealing is known to experience a dramatic slow down at low temperatures because energy barriers become exponentially large @xcite . by overcoming the barriers via quantum tunnelling  @xcite instead of thermal activation , quantum annealing as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonianadiabaticpassage ] ) offers the prospect of outperforming classical annealing @xcite .",
    "however , the speed - up of quantum annealing has been only shown for certain classes of problems @xcite and for devices running at finite temperature aqo has been put into question entirely @xcite . in all of this ,",
    "the precise role of quantum effects during the sweep is an open question , although the presence of entanglement during quantum annealing at finite temperature has recently been demonstrated in superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "a measure for the efficiency of aqo protocols is the success probability @xmath20 , defined as the overlap between the final state @xmath21 with the actual ground state @xmath22 of @xmath23 .",
    "note that this measure can only serve as a benchmark , since it requires a priori knowledge about the solution of the problem .",

    "we give a short overview of the structure of this paper . in section  [ sec : trappedions ] , we present feasible implementations of various np - complete problems in trapped ions and show how noise can be engineered in a controlled manner . in section  [ sec : entanglementobservables ] , we introduce relevant entanglement measures that we use in this work .",
    "analytical results on the relation between entanglement after the sweep and the success probability are presented in section  [ sec : upperbound ] .",
    "numerical results for closed and open systems are discussed for a model problem , the coulomb glass , in section  [ sec : numericalresults ] .",
    "we close by presenting our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we present how current trapped - ion technology @xcite can be extended to implement several well - known np - complete problems @xcite .",
    "the main challenge is to encode these problems in @xmath9 [ eq .  ( [ eq : hfinal ] ) ] , which requires a certain degree of programmability of interactions @xmath2 and fields @xmath5 .",
    "below , we present several models where a local variation of laser power is sufficient to obtain this programmability  as opposed to a much more difficult programming by , e.g. , an extensive number of laser frequencies @xcite or specially designed trapping potentials  @xcite .",
    "we also describe how engineered noise can be generated in order to study the interplay between decoherence , non - adiabaticity , and entanglement in the well - controlled architecture provided by trapped ions .",
    "we consider a chain of ions confined in a linear paul trap .",
    "the spin-1/2 ising variables appearing in @xmath0 can be encoded by restricting the internal atomic dynamics to only two hyperfine sublevels .",
    "single - qubit rotations allow for a preparation with high fidelity of any desired initial product state @xcite , including the completely polarized ground state of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the projection of the spin-1/2 variable on any coordinate direction can be measured to high precision by appropriate single - qubit rotations followed by stimulated fluorescence measurements , allowing the reconstruction of arbitrary correlation functions @xcite . the synthetic magnetic fields @xmath5 and @xmath29 appearing in @xmath0 and @xmath10 can also be simulated in a straightforward fashion via ac - stark shifts or by resonantly driving the transition between the two sublevels @xcite .",
    "ising interactions can be simulated by coupling the ions via laser @xcite or microwave radiation @xcite to the collective vibrational modes . in the limit of off - resonant radiation",
    ", one can disentangle the collective vibrations and the atomic ising variables via a canonical transformation and obtain an effective hamiltonian for the ising variables alone .",
    "for example , when employing a mlmer ",
    "srensen scheme @xcite , the ising spins are subject to the effective interactions ( see appendix  [ sec : appendixisinginteractionsinions ] ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is lamb  dicke parameter including the amplitude of vibrational mode @xmath32 at ion @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the detuning of the laser relative to the vibrational mode @xmath32 , and @xmath35 is the absolute value of the laser s rabi frequency at ion @xmath33 . for the derivation of eq .  , we assumed the off - resonance condition @xmath36 .",
    "the addition of a transverse field , required for our choice of @xmath10 , induces additional couplings to the phonon modes in higher order , which , however , can be neglected as long as @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the precise form of the interactions depends on the coupling scheme used , but the qualitative behavior is similar for other schemes @xcite .",
    "as shown , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite , when transmitted via the transverse phonon modes the ising interactions follow an approximate power law as a function of the distance , @xmath39 , with a decay coefficient @xmath40 that can be adjusted using the detuning @xmath34 ( where larger detuning entails larger @xmath41 ) .",
    "when employing the longitudinal phonon modes , the large spacing of vibrational frequencies restricts the range to @xmath42 . by expressing the local rabi frequencies as multiplies of a reference frequency @xmath43 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath44 , we can thus write @xmath45 with @xmath46 setting the overall energy scale .",
    "note that the power - law decay is exact only in the limits @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , the interactions in the intermediate regimes are better described by an exponential tail added to a dipolar decay .",
    "additional modifications may arise from an uneven spacing of ions as is usual in linear paul traps or from inhomogeneous laser profiles .",
    "for small chains , a general power - law behaviour is , however , a good approximation of the system dynamics @xcite .    until now , we considered a coupling to a single set of vibrational modes .",
    "however , richer models can be quantum simulated by employing the fact that in a linear paul trap the three orthogonal directions of vibration decouple @xcite . in this case , by using different lasers to couple to each orthogonal set of modes , it is possible to generate three independent ising interaction terms , which we label @xmath49 . additionally , one may induce synthetic fields @xmath5 in an ion - dependent fashion by , e.g. , resonantly driving the qubit transitions with beams derived from an acousto - optic deflector @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible to realise in trapped ions  using available technology  the following ising hamiltonian : @xmath50      [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     experiments thus far  aiming at mimicking translationally invariant many - body models  made great efforts to engineer systems as homogeneous as possible , i.e. , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xcite . for the same reason , few theoretical works have considered a site - dependent tunability of couplings @xcite or fields @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our purpose of engineering np - complete problems in hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : hfinal ] ) requires a certain degree of programmability of the interaction matrix elements @xmath2 and fields @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "[ tab : npcompleteproblems ] , we present several np - complete problems that can be implemented with interactions of the form given in eqs .   and  , i.e. , without requiring a full programmability of interactions .",
    "these problems thus become amenable to current trapped - ion technology by adjusting the local laser intensities @xmath54 .",
    "the np - complete problems implementable in this way include the _ number - partitioning problem _ , the _ integer knapsack problem _ @xcite , and the _ coulomb glass problem _ , which  as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite  can be mapped to a class of _ opti - cut problems_. we summarize the description of the necessary hamiltonian parameters in table  [ tab : npcompleteproblems ] . in the numerical studies presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : numericalresults ] , we focus on the example of the coulomb glass problem , since it is closest to current experiments @xcite .",
    "the coulomb glass @xcite contains a random magnetic field @xmath55 $ ] and ising interactions that are homogeneous and long - ranged , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "usually , one imposes the constraint of vanishing total magnetization , which can be realized by mean - field - like interactions ( @xmath58 ) with @xmath59 . defining the strength of the constraint as @xmath60 ,",
    "the total hamiltonian is then @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "the large frustration of the ising interactions counteracts ordering tendencies and , for @xmath63 , leads to a strong competition between the interactions and the random local fields .",
    "this competition signs responsible for its computational complexity .",
    "currently , it is not clear whether the coulomb glass exhibits a spin - glass transition at nonzero temperature .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily imply a reduced complexity of the ground state of the model .",
    "certain random ising models on chimera graphs , such as implemented in the d - wave device , for example , do not show spin - glass transitions at nonzero temperature , but finding the ground state of the model is still np - hard .",
    "additionally , it may be that a non - perfect power - law decay , for example the more realistic dipolar plus exponential shape @xcite affects the complexity of the model .",
    "a fundamental question in aqo is how the optimization of problems such as given in table  [ tab : npcompleteproblems ] performs in the presence of decoherence .",
    "this question is of particular importance for current implementations of aqo devices such as the d - wave machine where decoherence rates are large compared to the annealing times .",
    "current trapped - ion setups are able to suppress noise to very low values , currently with time scales around @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility to systematically study the performance of aqo under varying degrees of purposefully engineered decoherence .",
    "a scheme to engineer different types of classical noise in a controlled fashion has recently been discussed and implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",

    "detailed derivations can be found in the appendix  [ sec : appendixnoiseinions ] .",
    "here , we sketch the main idea , which is based on the addition of randomly fluctuating synthetic magnetic fields .",
    "we assume that the rate of these fluctuations is much larger than any other parameter in the hamiltonian , so that we can treat the annealing parameter @xmath65 as quasi - constant .",

    "[ sec : ionhamiltonian ]",
    ". the additional requirement of fast fluctuations that are uncorrelated between different sites could be solved via a simultaneous addressing of the individual ions using several laser beams derived from an acousto - optic deflector @xcite .",
    "if the bandwidth @xmath71 of the fluctuations is much larger than the internal energy scales of the ions and the coupling to the phonon modes , @xmath72 , we can average over the noise and obtain a master equation describing classical white - noise dephasing , @xmath73 + \\gamma \\sum_i d[\\sigma^{(x)}_i ] + \\gamma \\sum_i d[\\sigma^{(z)}_i]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 = 2 x\\rho x^\\dagger - \\rho x^\\dagger x - x^\\dagger x\\rho$ ] is the lindblad super - operator . in the derivation of eq .  , we neglected additional couplings to the phonon modes that appear in higher order and can be dropped provided @xmath75 .",

    "[ sec : appendixnoiseinions ] , we discuss that they can all be fulfilled for realistic experimental parameters .",
    "hence , adding fluctuating fields with bandwidth much larger than other relevant energy scales allows to systematically engineer white noise in trapped ions . by inducing such fluctuations on the longitudinal or transversal fields ,",
    "it is possible to study different types of lindblad super - operators .",
    "aqo aims at solving classical problems using a quantum device , prompting the fundamental question of the role and importance of quantum effects within such a computational scheme .",
    "one particular feature of quantum as opposed to classical systems is entanglement , a theoretical study of which is the second central aim of this work . for that purpose ,",
    "we use different quantifiers for quantum many - body correlations : the entanglement entropy , the logarithmic negativity , an optimal local entanglement witness , and the fisher information .",
    "all of these quantifiers are sensitive towards different forms of entanglement and thus allow to address different aspects of entanglement .    in a perfect adiabatic protocol",
    ", entanglement vanishes in the initial and the final state , but it is finite during the sweep .",
    "the intermediate entanglement is due to avoided crossings between the ground state and excited states . in an optimal sweep , the final state shows no entanglement at all , as the true ground state is that of a classical ising model .",
    "therefore , entanglement in the final state is an indication for imperfections during the sweep .",
    "this mechanism of build - up and release of entanglement during an adiabatic optimization is the focus of the remainder of this work .",
    "a full study of the many - body entanglement , which would require a full state tomography , is computationally and experimentally not feasible for all but very small systems .",

    "thus , many spin flips should be necessary to tunnel from one local energy minimum to the next .",
    "if one assumes that all of these spins have to be coherent during the tunnelling process , multi - particle entanglement may become the critical phenomenon for the efficiency of aqo protocols .",
    "+ _ optimal local entanglement witness. _ while the above entanglement observables are powerful tools to theoretically understand the nature of entanglement , they require elaborate measurements in experiment .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to find entanglement witnesses that can be deduced from simple observables .    here , we introduce an _ optimal local entanglement witness _ @xmath101 that allows one to measure entanglement in closed as well as open systems .",

    "this procedure can be done via post - processing of the measured two - point correlation functions , which are simple observables in trapped - ion experiments @xcite .",

    "we found that , contrary to popular assumption , a large entanglement during the optimization has little significance for its success probability . on the other hand , in clean systems ,",
