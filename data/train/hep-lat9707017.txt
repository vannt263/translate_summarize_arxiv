    "a possible way to obtain new universality classes ( uc ) is to add disorder to known pure systems .",
    "the harris criterion  @xcite says that , if the specific heat diverges with a power law in the pure system , then , the disorder will change the critical behavior of the model , i.e. a new uc will appear .",
    "conversely , if the specific heat does not diverge in the pure system , then , the critical exponents of the disordered system will remain unchanged . in the limiting case ,",
    "what amounts to a discontinuous or a logarithmically divergent specific heat , the criterion does not apply and we need to study analytically or / and numerically the system .",
    "the quest and the characterization of new uc are very important in dimensions two and three ( with a direct relevance on condensed matter physics ) and in four dimensions ( with implications on high energy physics ) . in the last case it is crucial to characterize all the possible uc , in order to be able to define a field theory on a non - perturbative basis .",
    "as the gaussian model gives a trivial one ( i.e. at long distances the theory will be free ) we are interested in finding a non - gaussian uc .    in this paper",
    "we will study the four dimensional site - diluted ising model that was previously studied  @xcite by two of the authors , who calculated numerically the critical exponents , analyzing the divergences with the temperature .",
    "their results pointed to non gaussian critical exponents , for large values of the dilution , but it was noted the possibility of a crossover between the behavior found and the gaussian one .    in order to obtain accurate measures of the critical properties we have repeated the simulations in a greater number of spin configurations .",
    "the use of finite size scaling ( fss ) techniques allows us to work in large lattices at the critical point .    using the perturbative renormalization group ( prg ) equations",
    "we calculate the dependence of the observables at the critical point with the scale of the system including logarithmic corrections .",
    "these are different from the pure system .    our determination of the critical exponents and other critical properties matches very well with the predictions of the prg : a gaussian critical behavior with logarithmic corrections .",
    "we check this behavior along the critical line in a wide range of concentrations , from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ( the percolation threshold is near 0.2 ) .",
    "we remark that a scenario based on hyperscaling seems completely unlikely from our numerical simulations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model and the observables . in section 3",
    "we present our analytical calculations , obtaining the fss formulas and calculating the values of two different binder cumulants in the thermodynamic limit . in section 4",
    "we describe the numerical methods and the different techniques that we will use to analyze the observables . in section 5",
    "we show our numerical results confronting them with the analytical predictions .",
    "finally we report the conclusions .",
    "the model we study numerically in this article , is defined in terms of z@xmath3 spin - variables placed in the nodes of a hypercubic four - dimensional lattice .",
    "the action is    @xmath4    where the sum is extended over nearest - neighbors , and the @xmath5 are quenched , uncorrelated random variables , taking the value @xmath6 , with probability @xmath7 , and @xmath8 with probability @xmath9 .",
    "an actual \\{@xmath5 } configuration , will be called a _ sample _ from now on . for every observable",
    "it is understood that first one performs the ising model calculation and then the @xmath0-average .    in the following",
    ", we shall denote an ising average with brackets , while the sample average will be overlined .",
    "the observables will be denoted with calligraphic letters , i.e. @xmath10 and with italics the double average @xmath11 .",
    "we define the total nearest - neighbor energy and the normalized magnetization as    @xmath12    @xmath13 being the volume ( defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the lattice size ) .",
    "we also define the susceptibility as    @xmath16    another very useful quantity is the binder parameter :    @xmath17    other kind of binder parameter , meaningless for the pure system , can be defined as @xmath18    a very convenient definition of the correlation length in a finite lattice , reads  @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is defined in terms of the fourier transform of the magnetization @xmath21 as @xmath22    this definition is very well behaved for the finite - size scaling ( fss ) method we employ  @xcite , and it is also fair natural for considerations about triviality  @xcite",
    ". finally , we measure the specific heat @xmath23",

    "we will later argue that the only relevant parameters of the disorder distribution are its mean , @xmath26 , and variance , @xmath27 , so we will assume for simplicity the gaussian distribution    @xmath28\\propto { \\mathrm d}[m^2 ] \\exp\\left(- \\frac{(m^2(x)-r)^2}{2 { \\mathit{\\delta}}^2}\\right ) \\ .\\ ] ]    when the disorder is quenched we need to compute , in a first step , the free energy of the system for a given choice of the disorder ( in this case of the mass term ) , and then average this free energy with the probability distribution of the disorder . to manage this kind of problems",

    "as , it follows that @xmath142    to finish this section we will report , for completeness , the finite size formulas for the same observables in the pure case  @xcite : @xmath143    the latter expressions can also be obtained with the method described above .",
    "the choice of the monte carlo ( mc ) update algorithm should be carefully considered .",
    "the wolff single cluster method  @xcite is the best choice for the pure model .",
    "however in the diluted case , small isolated clusters of spins are very likely to appear .",
    "those clusters are scarcely visited by the wolff method .",
    "therefore , we have complemented the updating method with a metropolis sweep per measure . we have checked that this algorithm thermalizes appropriately the configurations for @xmath144 , by comparing the numerical results from cold and hot starts . however , for @xmath145 , equilibration by this method becomes really hard to achieve .",
    "this is due to the presence of intermediate size clusters almost isolated from the percolating one .",
    "we have then turned to the swendsen - wang ( sw )  @xcite algorithm which guarantees that all - sized spin - clusters are considered . in this way",
    ", we find complete agreement between hot and cold starts .",
    "we have also compared the results of a sw and a single - cluster simulation at @xmath146 on our largest lattice , finding compatible results . however , to get a statistically - independent new configuration takes significantly longer ( in cpu time ) with the sw algorithm .    for every",
    "observable , one first averages in the sample , then averages between different samples .",
    "therefore , a crucial point is how long each sample simulation should be .",
    "assuming full statistical independence between different measures ( quite possible with a cluster method ) , and also between measures taken in different samples , the variance of such a mean is    @xmath147    where @xmath148 is the number of samples generated and @xmath149 is the number of measures in each ising - model simulation .",
    "the variance between samples of the thermal average of our observable is @xmath150 and , finally , @xmath151 is the average of the variances in each sample . on the other hand ,",
    "the computational effort is roughly proportional to @xmath152 , as the computer usually spends a fixed fraction of the time measuring .",
    "it is then clear that the optimum value of @xmath149 can not be much bigger that @xmath153 .",
    "one could even be tempted to measure just once by sample .",
    "however , we shall come back to this point when discussing re - weighting methods .      the critical curve slope ( see fig .",
    "[ phases ] ) changes quite abruptly .",
    "it is nearly vertical for large @xmath7 and almost horizontal close to the percolation threshold .",
    "it is therefore wise to choose a re - weighting method such that we may extrapolate to different @xmath154 values close to the pure model , but to different @xmath7 values at very strong dilution .",
    "let us then comment both extrapolation methods separately .",
    "the energy measures allow the calculation of @xmath154-derivatives of observables , and the use of the standard re - weighting methods , before the sample - average is performed .",
    "however , an important point should be made now , so let us recall how are they calculated :    @xmath156    @xmath157    it is clear that both expressions are biased .",
    "for instance , the expectation value of eq .",
    "( [ derivada ] ) , when the averages are calculated with @xmath149 measures , is really @xmath158 @xmath159 being the integrated autocorrelation time  @xcite , which depends on the sample . the bias for eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) is also of order @xmath160 , but terms of higher order in @xmath161 are to be expected .",
    "these biases are immaterial for usual mc investigations , as the statistical error decreases with the square root of the number of measurements . however , in our case the bias is of order @xmath162 , while the statistical error is of order @xmath163 , which are similar in our simulations !",
    "the cure for this is to introduce unbiased estimators .",
    "a possible method would be to measure in completely independent samples , ensuring @xmath164 for every sample . in this case the unbiased estimator is constructed multiplying by @xmath165 the @xmath154-derivatives and by other more complex functions the extrapolated observables .",
    "however , this would be too expensive from the computational point of view .",
    "the solution we find is to work with @xmath166 , repeat the calculations with different values of @xmath149 and extrapolate @xmath167 .",
    "specifically , in each sample , we calculate the derivative with the full mc history , obtaining a number @xmath168 , the bias being proportional to @xmath160 .",
    "we then consider two contiguous halves of the mc history , repeat the calculation for each one and average the final result .",
    "this value , @xmath169 , has a bias that goes as @xmath170 .",
    "the next term , @xmath171 , is obtained with four quarters with a bias proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "the linear extrapolation is @xmath173 and the quadratic one @xmath174    we then average @xmath175 and @xmath176 for all the samples , checking that the difference is negligible compared with the statistical error . in fact , we have found that the slope in the @xmath177 plane is a very clean and easy measure of @xmath159 , which we have used to achieve statistical independence between different measures .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ tau ] for an example .",
    "we proceed analogously with the extrapolations of observables or their derivatives .",
    "another approach to eliminate the biases is to split the measures in statistically independent sets and multiply the average of some operator in the first set by the average of another operator in the second set . in some cases ( for instance derivatives extrapolated at different couplings )",
    "it could be necessary to work with more than two independent sets .",
    "as in practice one have contiguous mc measures , the statistical independence of the measures becomes involved when splitting in several sets .",
    "the comparison between the quadratic extrapolation and the linear one makes it possible to monitor this _ short mc history _ effects . in some cases due to the necessity of a large extrapolation in the coupling",
    ", we have found differences between @xmath175 and @xmath176 around one half of the statistical error ; then we have repeated the simulation at a nearer point .",
    "in addition to the standard @xmath154-extrapolation  @xcite , it is also possible to extrapolate the mean values obtained at a given dilution probability , @xmath7 , to a close one @xmath179 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "let us simply recall that the probability of finding a occupation number @xmath180 , when filling sites with probability @xmath7 , is binomial . therefore the re - weighting is calculated from a set of @xmath148 mean values of an observable @xmath10 and the actual density of the configuration @xmath181 :    @xmath182    the visible region is of course constrained to the variance of the binomial distribution @xmath183 .",
    "fortunately , it has been enough for us .",
    "using equation ( [ reweig ] ) @xmath7-derivatives of observables can also be computed , but statistical errors are about eight times bigger than for @xmath154-derivatives . therefore , our choice is to study @xmath7-extrapolated @xmath154-derivatives , where all the above comments for the bias in the derivative are in order , but the re - weighting is unbiased .",
    "as already stated in the introduction , we consider the possibility of finding a non - gaussian fixed point in four dimensions , where hyperscaling relations were fulfilled .",
    "in such a case , the usual fss ansatz is expected to hold .",
    "however , the prg analysis rather suggests the presence of logarithmic corrections to the gaussian behavior .",
    "therefore , we should also consider the modifications in the fss ansatz induced by the logarithmic corrections . in this section",
    ", we shall first remind how critical exponents are measured ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for similar calculations ) , then we shall show how to deal with logarithmic corrections .",
    "when hyperscaling holds , a very accurate way of measuring critical exponents involves a form of the fss ansatz where everything is directly measurable on a lattice : @xmath184 where a critical behavior @xmath185 is expected for the operator @xmath186 , @xmath187 is the universal scaling - corrections exponent , and @xmath188 is a ( smooth ) scaling function .",

    "the numerical results are shown in tables  [ nunaive ] and [ etanaive ] .",
    "for the @xmath229 exponent we find , instead of a stable value , a monotonically decreasing one .",
    "for @xmath200 , such an evolution with growing @xmath15 is found , but it is clearly weaker .",
    "therefore , an infinite volume extrapolation is called for .",
    "if hyperscaling holds , we expect finite - volume scaling - corrections proportional to @xmath230 . as @xmath231 in the percolation  @xcite ,",
    "in the last row of both tables  [ nunaive ] and [ etanaive ] we include an infinite - volume extrapolation with @xmath232 .",
    "this fit is shown in figure  [ nu1/l ] .    .the @xmath229 exponent for @xmath233 pairs at the different dilutions . [ cols=\">,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     now , we can check hyperscaling violations of the form :    @xmath234    in figure  [ hyperscaling ] , we plot @xmath235 as a function of @xmath236 , the slope being directly @xmath237 .",
    "we can see that a good linear behavior is obtained .",
    "the fitted @xmath237-values are reasonably close to the theoretical prediction , but a growing trend with the dilution is self - evident .",
    "a naive ( wrong ) explanation is that this is an effect coming from the vicinity of the percolation critical point .",
    "indeed , we can repeat the previous fit in the pure percolation for similarly - sized lattices .",
    "fitting from @xmath238 we obtain @xmath239 with @xmath240 and from @xmath241 , the fit parameters are @xmath242 with @xmath243 .",
    "so a linear behavior is ruled out for this model .",
    "however , this is not surprising , as hyperscaling is known to hold for percolation in four dimensions .",
    "another interesting observable is the specific heat , which for the pure model is expected to diverge as @xmath244 , while in the diluted case it is expected to remain bounded .",
    "both predictions can be tested .",
    "the fitted values for the logarithmic divergence exponent , @xmath245 , are @xmath246    on the values of the binder cumulants at the infinite volume critical temperature we can see directly the ( logarithmic ) corrections to the scaling  . in the pure case",
    "we have obtained @xmath247 for the largest lattice at the critical point : we remark that the asymptotic value for the pure model is @xmath248 .",
    "it is possible to show using  @xcite that the leading correction to scaling term for @xmath76 goes as @xmath201 in both the pure model and the diluted one .",
    "our pure @xmath76-data are compatible with a limiting value of @xmath249 modified by @xmath201 corrections .    in the diluted model , we have obtained data for the @xmath76 cumulant around @xmath220 ( see fig .  [ cortesvmfijo ] ) which is quite larger than the predicted value @xmath250 ( see eq .",
    "( [ g4g2 ] ) ) .",
    "again , this numerical discrepancy can be understood taking into account corrections like @xmath201 . the same comments hold for @xmath75 .    in figure  [ g2g4 ]",
    "we have shown @xmath75 against @xmath76 for some values of the dilution .",
    "we have also plotted the theoretical value for the pair @xmath251 .",
    "this figure must be interpreted having in mind the previously cited logarithmic corrections to the scaling .",
    "it is clear that the complete numerical characterization of these cumulants needs further numerical work .",
    "finally we have studied the probability distribution of the observable @xmath252 ( i.e. we collect the histogram of the values of @xmath253 at every measure independently of the sample ) .",
    "we have found that for large values of @xmath252 the data follow a law @xmath254 . using the results of section ( [ s_binder ] ) it is possible to show that the theoretical prediction for the probability distribution is a gaussian with @xmath255 .",
    "the coefficient , @xmath256 , computed numerically follows very well a law @xmath257 in perfect agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "we have performed a monte carlo simulation of the site - diluted ising model in four dimensions , for several values of the dilution , and in a wide range of lattice sizes .",
    "the use of a finite - size scaling analysis allows us to consider big lattices just at the critical point . to gain accuracy",
    "we have repeated the simulations for many different hole configurations .    as a first stage",
    ", we have measured with great precision the critical exponents under the hypothesis of hyperscaling .",
    "the value we obtain for the @xmath229 exponent changes along the critical line , ruling out the possibility of a single non - gaussian fixed point .    using perturbative renormalization group techniques ,",
    "we have computed the scaling formulas for the diluted model , obtaining specific logarithmic corrections to the gaussian behavior .",
    "we have re - analyzed our numerical data finding that they agree with a gaussian scenario with logarithmic corrections to hyperscaling .",
    "the pure model has also been considered and its corresponding scaling formulas , checked .",
    "although the nature of the logarithmic corrections hardly allows to perform precise fits to the predicted functional forms , we have found a reasonable agreement .",
    "we thank to the cicyt ( contracts aen94 - 0218 , aen96 - 1634 ) for partial financial support , specially for the use of dedicated pentium pro machines where we have carried out the simulations .",
