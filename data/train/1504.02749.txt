    "@xcite were the first who formulated the idea about the analogy of flares on red dwarf stars and on the sun .",
    "at present it seems obvious that the physical nature of the activity of the sun and red dwarf stars is similar ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite put forward the pioneering idea about the important role of gas - dynamic effects in the formation of the emission of solar flares .",
    "the authors showed that the radiative cooling of the shocked gas can be a source of the flare s emission in the optical range .",
    "the shock wave is produced by impulsive heating of the chromosphere by suprathermal particles .",
    "the kostyuk  pikelner model predicts the formation of a relatively homogeneous gas layer , a few kilometers of thickness , which is responsible for the flare s optical emission in the continuum and spectral lines .",
    "the layer is located between the front of the downward shock and the region of plasma heated from above .",
    "this model was applied to the problem of flares on red dwarf stars in @xcite .",
    "the authors fulfilled calculations of a one - dimensional radiative shock wave and demonstrated the formation of a region with a small gradient of the plasma parameters : temperature , pressure , and density ( see figures  3 and 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "this result is confirmed by the calculations of the radiative cooling behind a shock front in the atmospheres of cool stars ( see @xcite and @xcite ) with a more detailed account for the elementary processes in the plasma : ionization , recombination , bremsstrahlung , excitation and de - excitation of discrete levels of atoms and ions as well as radiation scattering at the frequencies of spectral lines .",
    "red dwarf stars have a complex structure of flare spectra : the intensities of the emission lines strongly increase , the continuum emission is also enhanced ; it is well approximated with planck curves obtained for different temperatures at the blue and red sides relative to the balmer jump ( see @xcite ) .",
    "layers producing the blackbody emission should be in a state close to thermodynamic equilibrium , whereas the gas generating strong emission lines is essentially non - equilibrium .",
    "thus , the flare plasma includes at the same time equilibrium and non - equilibrium regions .",
    "therefore , we investigate the problem of the formation of an emission spectrum in a wide range of the cloud parameters . we consider a homogeneous gas layer of thickness @xmath1 with definite values of temperature and density and consisting of pure hydrogen .",
    "we develop the model of @xcite in three points .",
    "firstly , we consider the influence of the layer s radiation ( bremsstrahlung and recombination ) on the occupation of atomic levels .",
    "this development is necessary , as the flare luminosity is stronger in the optical range than that of the quiescent atmosphere of the whole star .",
    "secondly , we take into account that broadening of the high members of spectral series is caused exclusively by the linear stark effect .",
    "thirdly , we consider the _ two - temperature _ approximation for a flare layer .    in section",
    "1 the problem is formulated . in section",
    "2 we write the set of equations of ionization balance with regard to the continuum . in section  3 the calculation of the continuum emission is described . in section  4",
    "we present the method of calculation of the quantum escape probability . in section  5 the intensities of the emission",
    "spectral lines are calculated .",
    "section  6 presents the results of the emission spectrum calculations of a layer with parameters possible in the flare regions of red dwarf stars .",
    "we calculate the emission in spectral lines and continuum of an homogeneous pure hydrogen layer .",
    "its temperature , density and dimensions are assumed to be given .",
    "the value of the ion  atom temperature , @xmath2 , is taken to be greater than the value of the electron temperature , @xmath3 , because both ions and atoms are heated more intensively than electrons at the shock front ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use the results of the radiative shock wave calculations by @xcite and @xcite to state the input parameter set .",
    "these calculations were fulfilled under the conditions of the atmosphere of a red giant star with an effective temperature of @xmath4 .",
    "the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the shock front are respectively @xmath5  ev and @xmath6  ev .",
    "the lyman-@xmath7 ( ly-@xmath7 ) optical depth , @xmath8 , in the cooling region , as it follows from @xcite , lies in the range @xmath9 the value of @xmath8 weakly depends on the density of the gas , as the cooling rate , @xmath10 , is proportional to the hydrogen atom concentration , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is cancelled : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 @xmath14 is the electron density , @xmath15 is the velocity of the gas flowing from the shock front , and @xmath16 is some time interval from the moment when a given gas layer intersects the shock front .    the value of @xmath17 is equal to the summa of the proton and atom concentrations : @xmath18 we accept @xmath17 typical for the m - dwarf chromospheres : @xmath19 the layer thickness , @xmath1 , is defined to be such that the condition is satisfied . the electron density is equal to @xmath20    the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 were obtained from a red giant star , which has a 100x smaller gravity compared to a red dwarf star .",
    "the ion - atom temperature at the shock front is determined by the shock velocity , @xmath21 , and weakly depends on the density of the gas .",
    "if the value of @xmath21 lies in the range @xmath22 km / sec , then it is true that @xmath23 the value of @xmath3 at the shock front is determined by the temperature @xmath24 of the unperturbed gas and heating due to the compression .",
    "the evolution of @xmath3 is caused by the balance between the supply of energy in elastic collisions with ions and atoms and radiative losses in the lyman-@xmath7 line .",
    "the radiative cooling in the hydrogen lines is the most intensive at @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that @xmath26",
    "the following processes we take into account : the electron impact ionization , excitation , and de - excitation , the triple recombination , radiative recombination ( induced and spontaneous ) as well as the influence of the layer s bremsstrahlung and recombination radiation on its ionization and excitation states .",

    "we use the kramers approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for the photoionization cross sections from the excited levels .",
    "the rates of the inverse processes are calculated following the detailed balance principle .",
    "the spectral lines optical depth can be rather large in this problem , so the scattering of line radiation should be taken into account .",

    "the values of @xmath30 are calculated in the section [ probab ] for the resonance as well as subordinate transitions .    according to the standard notation , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the probabilities of spontaneous and induced transition from the upper level @xmath28 to the lower level @xmath27 , and @xmath33 is the absorption coefficient .",

    "we consider that the deviation of the observed h@xmath7 line profile from the stark profile in the red wing ( see fig . 9 in @xcite )",
    "is almost entirely due to neglecting the contribution of electrons to the line broadening in the optically _ thick _ flare plasma .",

    "however , in the homogeneous layer model no strong lines on the background of the planck continuum observed by @xcite are obtained .",
    "probably , we see in the flares the total emission from several layers ; some of them are transparent in the continuum , while other ones are not .",
    "we hope to get a better agreement with observations by calculations of the radiative cooling behind the shock front under the conditions of the red dwarf chromospheres , since the shocked gas can include at the same time equilibrium and non - equilibrium regions .",
