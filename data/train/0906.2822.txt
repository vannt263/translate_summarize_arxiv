    "justifying its use in what follows , one of the great advantages of the woodhouse axiomatics @xcite resides precisely in the absence of the chronometric hypothesis ( ch ) of general relativity as well as in references to somehow unspecified standard or  absolute \" clocks .",
    "let us recall that the chronometric hypothesis is defined by the equality @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the proper time of the clock ( also known as the ` _ _ atomic time _ _ ' ) , @xmath2 is the time interval between two events and is defined from a given metric field @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the so - called ` _ _ gravitational time _ _ ' ( up to the speed of light @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite strongly criticized this hypothesis , invoking at least two reasons : 1 ) it can be replaced by the conformal or projective structures without a metric field , and 2 ) the shifts between atomic and gravitational times can be deduced from the kundt - hoffmann protocol @xcite and , as a result , allow the selection of those clocks satisfying the equality defined by the ch .",
    "these axiomatics are one of those appropriate frameworks under which the latter shifts , which are scale factors differing from @xmath5 , enable us to track physical justifications to the ch .",
    "the main tool we use throughout is the geometrical situation encountered in the so - called ` _ _ clock ( pseudo-)paradox _ _ , ' the solutions of which explicitly require the ch .",
    "additionally , this is another great advantage of the woodhouse axiomatics for approaching temporal paradoxes , since it does not refer to any proper time notions .    for more on the geometric settings",
    ", we recall that in these axiomatics , the so - called ` _ _ message functions _ _ '",
    "@xmath6 and ` _ _ clock functions _ _ ' @xmath7 ( i.e. the time parameterizations defined by woodhouse ) are only defined for ` _ _ particles _ _ ' @xmath8 ascribed to worldlines of freely falling massive punctual objects , and the metric fields @xmath3 depend only on particles @xmath8 up to conformal factors defined for clock functions @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , upstream of the metric structure given by @xmath3 , there is a unique affine structure given by the totality of the freely falling particles of the woodhouse axiomatics or equivalently , from ehlers _ et al .",
    "_ , a weyl structure , i.e. , in particular , a class of conformally equivalent riemann structures .",
    "weyl structures do not fix rates of clocks a priori independently of their histories .",
    "this is the so - called second clock effect .",
    "the opposite case was dismissed by audretsch @xcite , who concluded that there were several efforts after 1970 to assign a weyl geometry to spacetime rather than a riemannian geometry . in reality , this is close to our viewpoint , i.e. , that rates of clocks , invoked to approach the ch via the clock paradox , are not observable , but fixed only respective to very particular given causal protocols exhibiting the physical and historical relationships among particles themselves , each endowed with particular different sub - structures of a given common conformal one . obviously , whenever the ch is posed and the metric connection is chosen , then the clocks with proper time aging ( or those that are  displaying \" a proper time ) are automatically inferred from the so - called ` geodesic hypotheses ' as well as singled out , and so , there are clearly no clock paradoxes .",
    "the differential aging is quite simply given from the proper time differences obtained from the integration of the infinitesimal proper times along each worldline .",
    "however , the ch actually raises the point that we must feature a proper time notion in the physical viewpoint .",
    "that is , we must find a proper time definition _ regardless of _ the choice of time parameterizations of the worldlines carried out for each particle of the woodhouse axiomatics . on the contrary ,",
    "the differential aging would only translate or reflect the agreement between the proper time definition , and , in particular , the ch and the selected metric connections .",
    "that is to say , this agreement expresses the metric structure choice from the unique affine structure of a weyl spacetime .    additionally , the woodhouse results are situated upstream of the projective , conformal and weyl structures defined in particular in the ehlers _ et al",
    ". _ axiomatics .",
    "terms such as ` _ _ freely falling particles _ _ ' are simply generic , all the more so as their worldlines can not be defined from geodesic equations since metric connections are never utilized in the woodhouse formalism .",
    "the only important restriction in the definition of the particles is mainly , in our opinion , that it must satisfy the following fundamental property : that for each particle @xmath8 passing through each event @xmath9 in spacetime , there exists a neighborhood of @xmath9 into which a four - dimensional ` _",
    "_ @xmath10-congruence _ _ ' can be defined and which can also be an extension of @xmath8 . to some extent , this condition is a topological translation of the possible existence in this neighborhood of a projective connection .",
    "it can finally be substituted for axiom @xmath11 of ehlers _ et al .",
    "_ , specifying the ( projective ) equations assigned to freely falling particles and , in some ways , incidentally and unfortunately , making a contradictory use of proper times .",
    "this indicates another advantage of the woodhouse axiomatics . as a fundamental result ,",
    "the true freely falling particles are those belonging to a .",
    "particles subjected to forces do not belong to it , but even in this case , the message and clock functions are still usable in the woodhouse formalism .",
    "returning to the tool used in the following , a resolution of the clock paradox is possible if the accelerations are involved in the differential aging formulas , since they are the sole data distinguishing the two clocks .",
    "this accounts for the well - known historical attempts made by einstein @xcite to solve it in general relativity .",
    "he used , in his own terms , a ` _ _ pseudo - gravitational _ _ ' field accounting for the accelerating force experienced by the moving clock , which is at the origin of the clock asymmetry .",
    "unfortunately , we run into an important problem with at least two distinct physical situations : the first is met in the case of rectilinear motions and the second is related to circular motions . in the first case , we refer , for example , to the unnikrishnan @xcite results , recalling and clearly showing some possible inconsistencies in the solutions based upon general relativity due to the use of pseudo - gravitational fields .",
    "however , in the second situation for circular motions and among the most precise recent experimental results , differential aging clearly does not depend in any way on a pseudo - gravitational field such as , for instance , the pseudo - field associated with the centrifugal force . in this last case ,",
    "the conclusion is clear : special relativity is more than sufficient to fully account for the experimental results .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to raise the question of why , when motions are rectilinear , we must use general relativity , if that is indeed what must be done , and why , in the case of circular motions , general relativity no longer intervenes .",
    "nevertheless , a certain type of mechanical work might also be used for interpretations and solutions , as we shall see .",
    "it is a fact that in the first , linear case , some forces work , whereas in the case of circular motions , centripetal forces do not .",
    "in addition , at the origin of the conformal proper times , considering an accelerating frame under a kind of primary initial geometry or special relativity , we know , for instance , that there are precession effects influencing space vectors , such as the spin vectors leading to the so - called thomas precession .",
    "the latter has a long - standing history in relation to the clock paradox . at the basis of the precession equations ,",
    "there is , as a particular case , the so - called _ mller term _ @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a velocity vector , or more generally , if @xmath14 is a velocity field , @xmath15 .",
    "then , if @xmath13 is the restriction of @xmath16 to a worldline and is tangent to the latter , this mller term can exactly account for another metric connection restricted to this worldline . as a result , the precessing vector is the tangent vector of a geodesic .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath16 precesses itself with respect to another precession equation , i.e. , if @xmath16 is _ congruent _ with another vector field , then its dual with respect to the metric defines a _ weyl proper time _",
    "* remark ( d ) p.67 , and p.81 ) .",
    "moreover , the vanishing behavior of this mller term meaning the primary connection @xmath17 is a projective connection with its corresponding geodesics defines the projective geodesics as being those of the primary initial geometry . in other words ,",
    "a non - vanishing mller term points to a change in a non - equivalent projective geometry , i.e. , a change of physical frame of reference , but it is at least compatible with the conformal structure .",
    "consequently , again and in particular , the flat minkowski spacetime should no longer be valid for non - geodesic motions .",
    "we could say that the projective connections and , thus , the weyl structures depend on the non - geodesic motions to which they apply .",
    "this is a way of justifying the use of varying weyl structures ( or projective structures ) attached to each particle .",
    "then , each worldline or particle should correspond to the restriction of a specific weyl structure only , and all these non - projectively equivalent weyl structures should be conformally related , leading to ( relative ) conformal proper times .    in the next section , we recall the different definitions given in the woodhouse axiomatics and the malament theorem .",
    "section [ coeur ] is divided into four sub - sections , of which the second is devoted to a difficulty that occurs systematically and is inherited from the simultaneity maps resulting in a non - trivial differential aging . in the third sub - section ,",
    "geometrical arguments that are necessary to define formulas for differential aging and are consistent with the experimental results are presented using conformal proper times . in the fourth sub - section ,",
    "the conformal factors in the previous formulas are physically interpreted , and then in section [ expert ] , these formulas are applied to certain experimental results .",
    "in the woodhouse axiomatics , the spacetime @xmath18 is a set of points , to which a set @xmath19 of subsets of @xmath18 called ` _ _ particles _ _ ' and denoted by @xmath8 is associated , each of them being homeomorphic to @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the set @xmath18 is not a priori a topological manifold , and the particles can not be loops .",
    "it is assumed that at least one particle @xmath8 passes through each point @xmath21 of @xmath18 .",
    "the first axiom of causality , i.e. , axiom 1a , states that , for each particle , an orientation can be selected among the two determined by the homeomorphism with @xmath20 such that , once these orientations are selected and fixed for the whole set @xmath19 of the particles , each event @xmath21 of @xmath18 can not be chronological to itself , i.e. , @xmath22 then @xmath23 .",
    "the ` _ _ chronological relation @xmath24 _ _ ' is then a partial and anti - reflexive order on @xmath18 .",
    "this is a global property of @xmath18 called the ` _ _ chronological principle _ _ ' , i.e. , there are no causal loops , and thus , @xmath18 is also called a ` _ _ chronological _ _ ' spacetime .",
    "axiom 2 states that the intersection of any particle @xmath8 with any open @xmath25 of the alexandrov topology then @xmath26 , and also @xmath27 .",
    "these sets are open for the alexandrov topology .",
    "] is open for the topology on @xmath8 ( issued from the borel topology on @xmath20 ) . from axioms 1a , 1b , 2 and 3 , providing @xmath18 with the alexandrov topology @xmath28 ,",
    "then @xmath29 is hausdorff , the chronological relation @xmath24 is  _ _ past- and future - distinguishing _ _ is ` _ _ future distinguishing _ _ ' if @xmath30 , and ` _ _ past distinguishing _ _ ' if @xmath31 . ] and  _ full _ , , @xmath32 such that @xmath33 , 2 ) if @xmath34 and @xmath35 then @xmath36 such that @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and 3 ) the dual relations of 1 ) and 2 ) are satisfied with the dual chronological relation @xmath40 . ] and each event @xmath41 possesses a  _ _ past and future reflecting _ _ ) @xmath42 of @xmath21 is an ` _ _ future and past reflecting _ _ ' open if @xmath43 then 1 ) @xmath44 ( _ future reflecting _ ) , and 2 ) @xmath45 ( _ past reflecting _ ) . ]",
    "open ( for @xmath28 ) neighborhood .",
    "then , woodhouse shows that @xmath18 is of the kronheimer - penrose type @xcite , where @xmath46 is the ` _ _ causal relation _ _ ' if @xmath47 and @xmath48 . ] and @xmath49 the ` _ _ horismotic relation _ _ ' if @xmath50 and @xmath51 . ] or ` _ _",

    "the ` _ _ clock functions _ _ ' associated with each particle @xmath8 of @xmath19 are homeomorphisms @xmath58 , which increase monotonically for the chronological relation .",
    "additionally , we define the ` _ _ radar coordinates _ _ '",

    "hence , if @xmath91 then there exists a unique ( no caustics ) light path that is at least piecewise smooth .",
    "one can notice that in the woodhouse axiomatics , we may have @xmath91 without light path joining @xmath21 and @xmath90 , meaning the latter have no common past- and future - reflecting open neighborhoods .",

    "of course , @xmath392 satisfies the relations @xmath394 and @xmath395 .",

    "one can rewrite the preceding formula in another form that is more amenable to easy interpretation : @xmath403 these two relations depend on the clock chosen , i.e. , the clock function @xmath7 and , thus , the functions @xmath102 . then",
    ", if there are no applied forces @xmath404 when considering the metric @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath405 , then naturally it is no longer the case considering instead the metric @xmath3 if @xmath406 and , reciprocally , if @xmath407 and @xmath408 .",
    "thus , this exactly represents the ` _ _ pseudo - fields _ _ ' of the gravity viewpoint , whose explicit terminology can be found in the einstein paper on the twin paradox @xcite as well as in the lift metaphor of the einstein equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "hence , their origins can be ascribed to the choice of a clock _ displaying _ a time differing from the proper time .",
    "then , to the lift metaphor , we could append a sort of _ unregulated clock metaphor _ to special relativity : a massive object is in inertial motion along a straight line at a constant relative speed when compared to a certain clock , and the latter suddenly starts to have a delay that can not be observed in the absence of an absolute time of reference . as a result",
    ", one would observe a sudden increase in the relative speed and , thus , a non - vanishing relative acceleration .",
    "however , we must mention that the accelerations given by accelerometers remain null , so that the motion remains inertial , even though the relative accelerations are modified .",
    "we can ascribe this variation to a geodesic or curvature variation to become non - zero , as well as to a pseudo - field of gravity occurrence .",
    "thus , these fields are  pseudo \" only relative to the choice of the conformal metric carried out a priori during the variation and , thus , of a clock .",
    "if the variations are not considered as being due to changes in temporal coordinates or clocks , then , quite naturally , two metrics @xmath3 and @xmath104 can be simultaneously associated with each particle @xmath8 . in the geometry defined by @xmath3 , there are no forces applied on @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath409 , and in the geometry defined by @xmath104 , a force @xmath404 is applied on @xmath8 and is interpreted as fictive on the metric @xmath3 , i.e. , ascribed to a pseudo - field of gravity .",
    "on @xmath8 , one would then have , for example , the forces of gravity or centrifugal forces , which would be fictive forces on @xmath3 but  true \" forces on @xmath104 .",
    "nevertheless , why would that not remain valid if the variations are considered as changes in clocks or clock functions ?",
    "indeed , how do we note such a change ?",
    "we do not have a local absolute clock against which we can calibrate the others .",
    "this is well highlighted in the _ allan deviation _",
    "@xcite of a pool of identical clocks .",
    "then , deduced from the latter , the precision of an atomic clock is no longer defined from an absolute , standard clock linked to a given temporal orientation , but from a statistical relation between clocks , and moreover , time drift bias can not be defined .",
    "thus in practice , an unobservable change in clock function is also equivalent to the sole observed change in geodesics ( related to curvature ) , and then , the lift metaphor can no longer be distinguished from that of an unregulated clock .",
    "therefore , this at once poses the question of the relation between clock functions and accelerations , forces or geodesics .",
    "thus , if the relation @xmath410 holds , we should interpret @xmath411 as a quantity associated , in some ways , with the mechanical work of a force @xmath404 , fictive on @xmath3 , or with an energy potential . from the previous equality ,",
    "one thus notes that the fact that this scalar product does not change when passing from @xmath412 to @xmath99 means that the work would not be , in any case , fictive .",
    "additionally , we can notice elsewhere that a non - fictive work is at the basis of the schild argument for deducing the gravitational frequency shifts in light ( * ? ? ?",
    "187189 ) .",
    "now , starting from the relation , the function @xmath279 should be a priori the mechanical work of force @xmath99 , along @xmath8 and dependent on the path . as we shall see",
    "the function @xmath279 could be the variation in the total energy of the particle minus the kinetic energy .",
    "lastly , it is significant to note that this interpretation for @xmath279 differs for instance from that given by wheeler @xcite for the weyl potentials .",
    "wheeler identified @xmath279 with the classical action ; it would be very appealing indeed to connect to the physics .",
    "however , the examples presented below prevent us , disappointingly , from making such an identification and lead us to dismiss such a proposal in the present situation .",
    "one considers in this section only verifications up to the order @xmath413 , corresponding to a first approximation of the definitions of the functions @xmath279 , whose refinements in their complete physical interpretations , under study , remain to be made if one wants to move to results up to the order of at least @xmath414 .",
    "this is the simplest situation , occurring when @xmath415 , but with at least two distinct clocks on the same worldline of a freely falling particle , with one of them not running .",
    "thus , in this case , @xmath416 if @xmath241 is on @xmath8 between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and it starts to run only while arriving at @xmath112 , so that @xmath128",
    ". then , the relation is written in the form : @xmath417 where @xmath418 because the clock on @xmath107 is not running .",
    "moreover , @xmath419 is then linked only to the internal energy of the running clock , since it is in free fall .",
    "let us consider the term of the entropy @xmath420 in classical thermodynamics , such that @xmath421 , where @xmath422 is the infinitesimal  internal \" work ( work not related to the kinetic energy ) .",
    "the terms @xmath423 and @xmath424 are dimensionless quantities and represent energies per unit of mass or per unit of thermodynamic energy , such as @xmath425 for instance ( @xmath150 being boltzmann s constant ) . setting @xmath426 , where @xmath427 is the entropy , and @xmath428 where @xmath429 is the internal work , and assuming @xmath430 with @xmath431 constant while the clock operates , then : @xmath432 then , we consider that the clock produces a positive variation in entropy during its irreversible counting : @xmath433 , and @xmath434 .",
    "thus , the relation : @xmath435 holds . setting by definition @xmath436 , where @xmath1 is the proper time of this clock , and considering @xmath7 as the time the clock displays as an increasing counter , then at each point",
    "@xmath276 such that @xmath437 , we have the variation : @xmath438 hence , the second law of thermodynamics would be equivalent to the monotonic increase of the proper time @xmath1 with respect to the displayed time @xmath7 , with entropy linking them .",
    "the question remains as to what the verification conditions are for the chronometric hypothesis .",
    "one notes that we must start from the relation and the scalar potentials of metric @xmath439 .",
    "the metric field @xmath3 is independent of @xmath8 and @xmath7 up to a conformal factor .",
    "in fact , the conformal factor depends upon the first - order derivatives of @xmath7 at point @xmath368 only such that @xmath440 . at this point @xmath368",
    ", one can show that the conformal factor is proportional to the square of the differential @xmath204 and , so , of @xmath441 from .",
    "the mere verification of the ch would involve having a constant non - vanishing factor to set down a relation of the form @xmath442 up to a constant factor .",
    "the condition is that for every point @xmath388 between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath443 .",
    "then , necessarily , we find @xmath444 .",
    "this can not be required for the whole of the interval between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and then , it remains only to suppose that there exist @xmath445 and @xmath446 such that @xmath447 when @xmath448 .",
    "hence , only in that case , the chronometric hypothesis would be equivalent to einstein s adiabatic hypothesis .",
    "moreover , if @xmath449 , then it requires , first , that @xmath450 is high when @xmath448 , and second , that we have an adiabatic process .",
    "these are conditions that atomic clocks should satisfy with @xmath451  closed \" to @xmath111 .",
    "additionally , let us investigate the case with @xmath452 and @xmath431 constant .",
    "for instance , the clock starts to spin or acquire a moment of rotation .",
    "then , to first order , we find the following expression : @xmath453 in other words , this process leads to a  slower aging \" of the clock compared to the case without rotation .",
    "this phenomenon should be strictly different from the  rejuvenation \" case found by prigogine _",
    "_ @xcite in the same circumstances of a rotating thermodynamic system . nevertheless",
    ", they did not account for the time of rotation while this rejuvenating effect occurred .",
    "this time could compensate for the rejuvenation , such that the system would only age more slowly , and then , actually , their phenomenon would be very similar to the present case .",
    "this well - known experiment @xcite brings into play three reference frames , each one using a cesium atomic clock : two jet aircrafts , one moving westward @xmath454 and the other eastward @xmath455 , and a ground control base station @xmath8 on the equator at null altitude .",
    "actually , hafele and keating used a fourth reference frame , i.e. , an inertial reference frame @xmath254 ( thus , in particular , without rotation ) associated with a remote star .",
    "following our notations , they computed the integrals @xmath456 and @xmath457 to the first order of the relativistic effects .",
    "the two aircrafts were supposed to fly along the equator at the same velocity @xmath102 with respect to the ground .",
    "the altitudes and the maximal velocities during this experiment were typically about @xmath458 and @xmath459 , respectively .",
    "the earth s equatorial radius is about @xmath460 and the mean angular velocity for the earth rotation about @xmath461 .",
    "thus , the equatorial tangential velocity is about @xmath462 .",
    "the aircraft moving towards the east moves in flight at a speed @xmath463 with respect to the frame @xmath254 , and the aircraft moving towards the west travels at a speed of @xmath464 .",
    "in addition , we denote by @xmath465 the constant of gravity at the equator .",
    "now , considering the first term in the integral in the formula for @xmath457 , the term @xmath466 in is the factor @xmath212 for one of the aircrafts . for the aircraft flying toward the east",
    ", we find : @xmath467 in this expression , @xmath3 is the minkowski metric , since we refer only to the remote inertial frame @xmath254 . then , to the first order , we obtain : @xmath468 the second term in the integral can also be written to the first order as : @xmath469",
    "lastly , according to our interpretations , the coefficient @xmath470 is equal to 1 , because @xmath8 is not subjected to an external working force . on the other hand",
    ", the coefficient @xmath471 will reflect the work @xmath472 of the external force that brings the aircraft @xmath455 to its cruising altitude and speed . under these conditions , and",
    "contrary to the function @xmath279 in the previous example for one clock only , it is necessary to take with @xmath473 the expression @xmath474 , where @xmath472 is the work per energy of mass unit @xmath475 , where @xmath476 is the mass of the aircraft .",
    "thus , with @xmath477 being the work of the forces ( directed to the ground ) given by the accelerometers and considering @xmath465 to be roughly constant , then we find the relation : @xmath478 hence , to the first order , the relation : @xmath479 is exactly that given by hafele and keating .",
    "thus , the following integrands correspond to each integral : @xmath480 the integrals are both computed with respect to the variable @xmath481 , and thus , we can subtract them to find the differential aging @xmath482 between the airplanes .",
    "equivalently , the term : @xmath483 must be integrated .",
    "rigorously , this difference is possible only if the two aircrafts are in flight at the same speed , in opposite directions , and at the same distance from the base @xmath8 .",
    "this hypothesis is also needed to compare with the integrand in the difference @xmath484 , i.e. , to avoid passing by the basis @xmath8 .",
    "then , we easily obtain the corresponding following integrands : @xmath485 subtracting these two terms gives the same result .",
    "one can also consider the use of the formula . as previously indicated , the metric @xmath3 is the minkowsky metric , only far from the earth . in the vicinity of the earth , this is the schwartzschild metric , and from the viewpoint of each aircraft in motion or of the base station @xmath8 , this metric is in a rotating reference frame .",
    "in addition , it must be synchronous , or equivalently , conditions such that @xmath486 must be satisfied .",
    "the schwarzschild metric can be approximated by the expression ( @xmath487 ) : @xmath488 where @xmath489 , and @xmath490 is the gravitational radius of the earth . in a rotating reference frame such that @xmath491 , @xmath492 , and by replacing @xmath493 by @xmath494 with the approximation @xmath487 and taking into account the orders of magnitude for @xmath495 , @xmath496 and @xmath497 , we can write the following approximation of @xmath2 : @xmath498 however , we need a metric in a synchronous frame , so a change of basis is performed by replacing @xmath499 by @xmath500 and also by multiplying all of the terms by a factor  @xmath229 ( i.e. , the basis is defined up to a conformal factor and a projective transformation ) : @xmath501 the constants @xmath229 and @xmath502 are chosen in order to normalize the metric ,",
    "i.e. , its determinant is equal to @xmath503 on the basis @xmath504 , and with the constraint : @xmath505 for the value of @xmath506 .",
    "then , to the first order , we find that @xmath507 and @xmath508 , and so : @xmath509 in order to evaluate the factor @xmath212 for this metric , the tangential velocity denoted by @xmath379 of an object with respect to this rotating reference frame is such that : @xmath510 with the upward velocity @xmath511 defined by : @xmath512 setting @xmath513 at the equator , the inverse of the factor @xmath212 for this metric is roughly of the form : @xmath514 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] let us now consider the formula to compute @xmath515 .",
    "we assume the angles are @xmath516 toward the east . with @xmath517 or @xmath518 and assuming @xmath519 , then , for the two cases , we find the relations : @xmath520 \\right\\},\\\\ & & \\notag\\\\ \\beta^-_e=-\\frac{\\mathrm{g}\\,h}{c^2 } , & & \\frac{e^{-\\beta^-_e}}{g(\\eta,\\zeta^+_1)}\\simeq 1+\\frac{1}{c^2 } \\left\\ { \\mathrm{g}\\,h - v\\,v_t-\\frac{v^2}{2 } -\\frac{h}{3r } \\left [ 4\\,v\\,v_t+v^2 \\right ] \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , in order to obtain @xmath515 , we need to integrate : @xmath521 with respect to @xmath7 . at the zeroth order in @xmath317 ,",
    "we find again the formula .",
    "we consider now the formulas obtained from the viewpoint of each aircraft , that is to say , @xmath522 or @xmath523 .",
    "first of all , in their proper frames , none of the external forces work , since the origins of the reference frames are the aircrafts themselves . however , the functions @xmath279 are the evaluations of the work of the forces being applied on the aircraft which is not at the origin of the considered reference frame .",
    "formula must be applied : @xmath524 there are the following correspondences : @xmath525 is the work of the forces given by the accelerometers placed on the aircraft moving toward the west and estimated in the reference frame of the same aircraft .",
    "reciprocally , @xmath526 is the work of the forces given by the accelerometers placed on the aircraft moving to the east and estimated by the plane flying toward the west . from the point of view of each airplane",
    ", these two sources of work would be the same if they could simultaneously be estimated with the function @xmath191",
    ". however , in fact , this is not even necessary because the function @xmath527 takes into account the temporal delay via the map @xmath528 .",
    "for the two differences , it is thus necessary to estimate the coefficients @xmath529 ascribed to @xmath455 .",
    "there is the following correspondence : @xmath530 \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath531 , a function of @xmath532 , is the velocity of the airplane travelling towards the east from the point of view of @xmath454 , and @xmath511 is its upward velocity .",
    "the expressions for the functions @xmath279 are : @xmath533 where the altitudes are functions of the values of the clock function @xmath532 , @xmath534 is the altitude of the airplane moving toward the east , and @xmath535 is that for the plane traveling west .",
    "these altitudes are , actually , relative altitudes between the two airplanes , not respective to the ground .",
    "one can thus make the reasonable assumption that @xmath536 . under these conditions , by considering @xmath537 , the integrand of @xmath522 is of the approximate form : @xmath538 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] this expression is far from that obtained in the reference frames of @xmath8 or @xmath254 , but in fact it means that the comparison of the integrated terms is no longer valid .",
    "it is the complete integral that must be computed .",
    "it follows that the doppler terms in @xmath539 must include dilatations and contractions of the durations depending on whether the airplanes are moving away from each other or are approaching one another along the equator .",
    "the contributions of these two modifications in duration will be the same and will be cancelled out at the conclusion of a circumnavigation .",
    "thus , only the effect of the term in @xmath540 will persist , leading to the same final result .",
    "we have seen that the clock paradox is perfectly solved within the relativity framework due to the asymmetry resulting from the factors @xmath541",
    ". however , at the same time , it is necessary to ascribe a new meaning to these conformal factors .",
    "these factors are strongly associated with the concept of total energy minus kinetic energy , which is not necessarily defined by a potential along each timelike worldline ( particles ) .",
    "actually , these functions @xmath279 imply in themselves the data of an additional dimension .",
    "more precisely , we have sheafs of germs of functions @xmath279 that are classes of scalar fields , which  mimic \" , at each given event , the values of the functions @xmath279 .",
    "in other words , we could have no such scalar fields on @xmath18 , but there is always the need for non - vanishing conformal scale factors , i.e. , values independent on the _ locus _ in the spacetime , which is an extra dimension . in the same vein , we can suggest a reply to a concluding question of ehlers _ et al . _ , asking whether other interpretations of the so - called weyl _ streckenkrmmung _ bivector @xmath542 rather than those ascribing the latter to the electromagnetic field _  might contain some physical truth\"_. the fact is that as a field , per se , we may have no such field @xmath542 , but only germs of such fields along particles or beams of particles .",
    "again , this bivector @xmath542 would be related as a germ to derivatives of the functions @xmath279 . however , in any case , such ( bi)vectors would be defined only in jet manifolds of germs of functions and , as such , would be associated with an extra variable .",
    "thus , it seems necessary to consider a spacetime supplied with an extra dimension of energy , i.e. , the conformal scale factors , that translates the various physical transformations without gravitational origins .",
    "therefore , it is basically a  spacetime \" of five dimensions upon a conformal spacetime of four dimensions .",
    "however , the geometrical structure should also be a product of copies of the spacetime @xmath18 fibered by conformal scale factors ( or equivalently , @xmath191 ) . in conclusion , this extra dimension is absolutely necessary in order to provide an account of the internal evolution of objects in relation to the spacetime structure , and it alone gives a meaning to the concept of the proper time of an object in relation to the chronology given on a spacetime .",
