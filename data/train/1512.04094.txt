    "in our search for a better understanding of physical phenomena in nature , we have faced many drawbacks in explaining well - recognized four - dimensional problems ; in particular , it is of higher importance to understand why physical nature dwells in four dimensions . in our attempts to come close to answering these and other questions ,",
    "we have employed means that are sufficiently intricate so that it has proven useful to wander into lower - dimensional spacetime models @xcite .",
    "although our initial hope was solely motivated by the wishful thought that we could learn useful things in a simpler setting , the wandering into lower - dimensional models has proven to be very fertile and has stimulated significantly the development of our knowledge in such a way that we are now able to explain statistical systems and condensed matter physics by means of planar physics  in two dimensions and three dimensions .    in recent years",
    ", we have witnessed a major advance in the description of so many important condensed matter phenomena by means of connections with high - energy theories @xcite .",
    "we can cite bcs superconductivity @xcite and novel materials such as graphene @xcite and weyl semimetals @xcite as some of the most remarkable examples where a partial or fully description is obtained by means of the use of effective proposals of gauge field theory models @xcite .",
    "in particular , within the broad class of effective models , one can find proposals in which the violation of lorentz symmetry is analyzed in some materials by means of effective low - energy theories ; e.g. , a lorentz - violating effective version of qed is used to describe weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "in addition to the technological advance motivated by the development of new material and matter states , we do also live nowadays in a thrilling era of rich high - precision experiments in particle physics , testing long - dated gauge theories , where structural pillars of theoretical gauge theories are scrutinized , in particular the cpt theorem and lorentz symmetry @xcite , whose violation would be a sensitive signal for unconventional underlying physics .",
    "furthermore , if we enlarge our scope and add to our interest the description of the nature behavior at shortest distances @xcite , i.e. a quantum theory of gravity , or even the so - called minimal length scale physics , one inexorably finds that noncommutative geometry is one of the highly motivated and richer frameworks @xcite , including phenomenological inspirations @xcite . in attempts to accommodate quantum mechanics and general relativity within a common framework @xcite",
    ", one finds uncertainty principles that are compatible with noncommuting coordinates , showing that the spacetime noncommutativity naturally emerges at plank scale .",
    "it is well known that noncommutative geometry is a self - sufficient theory , which over the past decade has found motivation in several theoretical frameworks @xcite , but one should highlight its prominent role in the many phenomenological attempts to detect sensitive deviations originated from physics at the planck scale @xcite . in summary , in the noncommutative scenario , it is supposed that the spacetime coordinate operators do not commute with each other and satisfy the commutation relation @xmath0=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{eq:0.1}\\ ] ] in which @xmath1 is a constant antisymmetric matrix of dimension of length squared . to construct a noncommutative field theory , using the weyl - moyal ( symbol ) correspondence @xcite ,",
    "the ordinary product is replaced by the moyal star product defined as @xmath2 inserting the above star product into the lagrangian density of the ordinary field theory yields a highly nonlocal theory , including higher - derivative terms which are not present in commutative theory .",
    "furthermore , the study of nc gauge theories have uncovered several interesting properties .",
    "in particular , a common feature in these theories is that the high - momentum modes ( uv ) affect the physics at large distances ( ir ) leading to the appearance of the so - called uv / ir mixing @xcite , even in theories with massive particles .",
    "contrary to the initial expectation ( which was that noncommutativity could render uv finite field theories ) , this mixing complicates the renormalization of the theory . despite the many attempts to cure it @xcite , with no complete success , the problem has not yet been fully understood .    in the exact same way as we have discussed above , the noncommutative three - dimensional field theory , in particular gauge theory ,",
    "can find application in the study of planar physics in condensed matter and statistical physics @xcite . despite the fact that some perturbative aspects of the noncommutative three - dimensional field theory have been studied in the context of the chern - simons theory @xcite and qed3 @xcite , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "none of the aforementioned studies were concerned with the analysis of the anomalies that the noncommutativity can cause in the physical content of the field , e.g. uv / ir mixing that can be present in the physical dispersion relation of the gauge field due to radiative corrections @xcite , and , therefore , modify significantly the behavior of the quantum field in the description of a given phenomenon @xcite .",
    "in addition , this calculation allows also an analysis regarding the infrared finiteness of the given cases @xcite .",
    "the maxwell - chern - simons theory consists of an important model with the striking feature of allowing a massive gauge field theory without any gauge symmetry breaking @xcite , in this case we have the so - called topologically massive electrodynamics ( it describes a helicity @xmath3 mode ) .",
    "the presence of commutative ( noncommutative ) chern - simons action can also be seen as resulting from quantum effects , arising from integrating out the fermionic fields in commutative ( noncommutative ) massive @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can refer to some analysis , with a different scope than ours , in regard to the noncommutative maxwell - chern - simons theory @xcite and its supersymmetric extension @xcite , as well as to the higher - derivative extensions of the chern - simons action ( in both commutative and noncommutative space ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the gauge field two - point function renormalizability and physically significant quantities on the one - loop order polarization tensor of the three - dimensional noncommutative maxwell - chern - simons theory , with particular interest in analyzing the gauge field dispersion relation in search of possible noncommutative anomalies and infrared finiteness .",
    "we begin , in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , by reviewing the general properties of the gauge - invariant noncommutative maxwell - chern - simons theory as well as its discrete symmetries .",
    "we determine the one - loop @xmath5 self - energy function , and by considering a general tensor form for it , we are able to find relations for the respective form factors . moreover , in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , the renormalizability for the gauge field two - point function in this model is carefully established and afterwards analyzed , since it can be jeopardized by the uv / ir mixing @xcite . within this context ,",
    "a multiplicative renormalization holds , and quantities of physical significance are readily defined . in section [ sec:4 ] , we compute explicitly the planar and nonplanar contributions for the form factor expressions , where the commutative limit of the given outcome is investigated .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we establish three particular physical cases of interest . in particular , we examine the highly noncommutative limit , where its physical dispersion relation is discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] , we summarize the results , and present our final remarks .",
    "we start our analysis by considering the gauge - invariant lagrangian density of the noncommutative maxwell - chern - simons theory in a minkowski spacetime @xmath6 where , the field strength tensor is @xmath7_{\\star}$ ] .",
    "the gauge - fixing term is chosen as to the usual lorentz condition @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the nakanishi - lautrup auxiliary field and the ghost term reads @xmath10 where the covariant derivative is defined such as @xmath11_{\\star}$ ] .",
    "the full theory is invariant under the brst slavnov transformations : @xmath12 the auxiliary field @xmath9 can be integrated out , since it plays no part on the theory s dynamics .",
    "now , the tree - level propagator for the gauge field can be readily obtained , in the landau gauge @xmath13 , as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gauge field mass originating from the chern - simons term .    by completeness , in order to discuss the one - loop structure of the polarization tensor , it is useful to review on the discrete symmetries of parity ( @xmath16 ) , charge conjugation ( @xmath17 ) and time reversal ( @xmath18 ) , for a three - dimensional noncommutative spacetime @xcite :    * \\(i ) _ parity _    parity transformation in @xmath19 dimensions is indeed a reflection described by @xmath20 and @xmath21 . under parity , the gauge field transforms as @xmath22 which leads to a @xmath16-invariant noncommutative maxwell term if we consider that the parameter @xmath23 is not changed under a parity transformation .",
    "however , the chern - simons kinetic term changes sign under @xmath16 , @xmath24 whereas , for the interaction term of the chern - simons part , we obtain @xmath25 it is thus concluded that the total noncommutative chern - simons terms are @xmath16-odd .    *",
    "\\(ii ) _ charge conjugation _    under a charge conjugation transformation , the gauge field changes as @xmath26 and",
    "consequently the noncommutative maxwell term is not @xmath17-invariant unless we consider @xmath27 , which has an intuitive explanation discussed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the chern - simons kinetic term transforms as @xmath28 to study the @xmath17 transformation of the chern - simons interaction part , it is useful to rewrite it as @xmath29_{\\star},\\ ] ] and therefore we have that under a charge conjugation transformation @xmath30 accordingly , under the above consideration , we see that the noncommutative chern - simons term is @xmath17-even .",
    "* \\(iii ) _ time reversal _    under a time reversal transformation ,",
    "the gauge field now changes as @xmath31 which yields a @xmath18-invariant noncommutative maxwell term , with the condition @xmath27 . for the chern - simons free part , we obtain @xmath24 as well as @xmath25 therefore ,",
    "the noncommutative chern - simons term is also @xmath18-odd . in view of the above arguments on discrete symmetries ,",
    "we conclude that the noncommutative maxwell action is even under @xmath32 and @xmath33 , while the noncommutative chern - simons action is @xmath32-odd and @xmath33-even , although both of these actions are separately @xmath34 invariant .",
    "we expect that the tensor structure of the photon polarization tensor , which is induced by quantum effects , inherits ( respects ) the properties , gauge and discrete symmetries , from the classical theory .",
    "the one - loop contributions for the gauge field self - energy are those from the cubic and tadpole self - interaction and ghost loop , and these diagrams are depicted in fig.[oneloopdiagrams ] . a detailed account for each one of them",
    "can be found at appendix [ appa ] .",
    "these contributions can be conveniently written in the following form , @xmath35 where we have used the notation @xmath36 .",
    "also , the tensor quantities at the numerator are defined , respectively , by eq . , @xmath37 and eqs . and @xmath38        as a check for eq .",
    ", we see that , apart from the trigonometric factor @xmath39 , the remaining of the expression is exactly the same as the one appearing in @xcite , where a detailed one - loop analysis of the yang - mills - chern - simons theory is presented .",
    "the most general tensor structure of the photon self - energy in a noncommutative three - dimensional spacetime is given as @xmath40 where we had chosen @xmath41 , with @xmath42 as our orthonormal basis .",
    "we notice , however , that @xmath43 in this basis has nine terms that reduce to four terms due to the ward identity is not totally symmetric , the ward identity must hold for both @xmath44 and @xmath45.](for further details , see appendix [ appb ] ) .",
    "it is notable that the tensor structure of the first and the third term in is analogous to that of the tree - level counterparts in commutative maxwell - chern - simons model , which is a free theory .",
    "indeed , the first term is even under @xmath32 and @xmath33 , while the third term is @xmath32-odd and @xmath33-even , they are similar to the commutative maxwell and chern - simons actions , respectively .    on the other hand , the second and the fourth terms have no tree - level counterparts in commutative maxwell - chern - simons model , arising fully from quantum effects . furthermore , the second term in , similar to the first term , is even under @xmath32 and @xmath33 , while the fourth term , similar to the third term , is @xmath32-odd and @xmath33-even .",
    "consequently , the behavior of the quantum effect terms is the same as that of the tree - level terms , as we expected .",
    "we observe hence that the specific decomposition appearing in the tensor structure of the photon self - energy in is physically justified , using the aforementioned discussion on discrete symmetries .",
    "besides , we see that the one - loop photon self - energy is invariant under @xmath27 , which is in agreement with its tensor structure described by .",
    "consequently , all of the form factor coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 in are expected to be even in @xmath23 , at least at one - loop level , as we see in the following identities , eqs. , @xmath50    with these quantities we have introduced all necessary information on regard to our analysis .",
    "next , we shall proceed and write explicitly the one - loop expressions for the form factors of the gauge field self - energy .      in order to evaluate the above relations , eqs.",
    ", we shall take the respective tensor contraction with the one - loop expression .",
    "first , the relation yields the following result , @xmath51 besides , from the relation , we obtain @xmath52\\bigg)\\nonumber \\\\   & + \\left(p.k\\right)\\left(m^{2}\\bigg(4p^{2}+7\\left(p.k\\right)\\bigg)+p^{2}\\left(p.k\\right)+4\\left(p.k\\right)^{2}\\right)\\biggr]\\biggr\\}.\\label{eq:1.11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , from the relation , we find the odd form factor @xmath48 as @xmath53 finally , the form factor @xmath49 follows as @xmath54    in order to evaluate the above momentum integration , we can make use of the standard rules for feynman integrals",
    ". we shall next continue with our formal development by providing now a detailed account for the renormalizability of the photon two - point function , which analysis will allow us to define properly the one - loop dispersion relation .",
    "we shall now formally establish the gauge field two - point function renormalizability .",
    "in particular , we want to determine the renormalized gauge propagator and mass , which allow us to define the physical pole and , therefore , the dispersion relation of the gauge field .",
    "we start by writing the complete propagator expression .",
    "moreover , we take @xmath55 in eq .. this is explicitly shown in eqs . and , which is expected to be true to all orders .",

    "thus , we introduce the wave function and mass renormalization constants as the following , @xmath64 and we also define the renormalized mass as @xmath65 the most significant consequence arising from the multiplicative property of is that the gauge symmetry is exactly preserved at classical ( tree ) and quantum ( loop ) levels . mainly because @xmath66 corresponds to the noncommutative maxwell theory which is gauge invariant at any order , without any mass generation .",
    "hence , by taking into account the above definitions , eqs . and , we rewrite the propagator in the form @xmath67}\\left(\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{p_{\\mu}p_{\\nu}}{p^{2}}-\\frac{\\tilde{p}_{\\mu}\\tilde{p}_{\\nu}}{\\tilde{p}^{2}}\\right)\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\mathcal{z}}\\left[p^{2}-m_{\\mathrm{ren}}^{2}\\right]}\\frac{\\tilde{p}_{\\mu}\\tilde{p}_{\\nu}}{\\tilde{p}^{2}}+\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{ren}}}{\\sqrt{{\\cal { z}}\\tilde{\\mathcal{z}}}\\left[p^{2}-m_{\\mathrm{ren}}^{2}\\right]}\\frac{i\\varepsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}p^{\\lambda}}{p^{2}}+\\frac{\\xi}{p^{4}}p_{\\mu}p_{\\nu}. \\label{eq:2.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be emphasized that in view of eq .",
    "the multiplicative renormalization holds for the gauge - invariant noncommutative maxwell - chern - simons theory , which is a remarkable result .",
    "furthermore , we should stress the fact that the physical massive pole @xmath68 is found to be naturally present at all physical terms of the complete propagator .",
    "since we are working within a perturbation theory approach , we can express the physically significant renormalized mass @xmath69 at the lowest - order in terms of the form factors as @xmath70 whereas the dispersion relation @xmath68 , the renormalized mass at the lowest order is given by and , hence , written in a convenient form : @xmath71    with this renormalizability discussion we conclude our formal development for nc maxwell - chern - simons theory .",
