    "nonaxisymmetric toroidal magnetic fields can provide intrinsically steady - state , disruption - free plasma confinement .",
    "however , unlike axisymmetric fields , nonaxisymmetric fields do not generally confine all trapped particle orbits .",
    "this shortcoming has a modest deleterious effect on energy confinement , which still follows scalings comparable to tokamak confinement due to turbulent transport @xcite .",
    "however , unconfined orbits will likely pose a serious problem in a reactor , where unconfined energetic alpha particles will collide with the first wall before thermalizing , causing unacceptable damage to the plasma - facing components .",
    "consequently , one criterion of stellarator optimization in recent years has been the quality of collisionless particle confinement .",
    "the ideal limit in which all collisionless trajectories are confined is known as omnigenity ( sometimes spelled omnigeneity ) .",
    "omnigenity can be defined more precisely as the condition that the time average of @xmath4 along each field line vanishes for all values of magnetic moment @xmath5 . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the magnetic drift velocity , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the gyrofrequency , @xmath11 is the species charge in units of the proton charge @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the mass , @xmath14 is the speed of light , and @xmath15 is the toroidal flux .",
    "as shown in appendix [ a : proofs ] , an equivalent definition of omnigenity is that the longitudinal adiabatic invariant @xmath16 is a constant on a flux surface .",
    "other equivalent definitions are the absence of a  @xmath17 \" regime of confinement , where @xmath18 is the collision frequency , or an effective helical ripple of zero .    one method of obtaining omnigenity in a nonaxisymmetric toroidal system is quasisymmetry , the design principle behind the hsx@xcite and ncsx@xcite experiments .",
    "quasisymmetry is usually defined@xcite as the condition that the field magnitude @xmath1 varies on a flux surface only through a fixed linear combination of the poloidal and toroidal boozer angles : @xmath19 for integers @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "quasisymmetry can also be defined as @xmath22 for other coordinates @xmath23 such as hamada angles ( as proved in appendix [ a : hamada ] ) , or by the coordinate - free conditions@xcite @xmath24=0 $ ] or@xcite @xmath25 .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath26 for guiding - center drift motion , when expressed in boozer coordinates@xcite , only depends on @xmath1 and not the vector components of @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , an ignorable coordinate in @xmath1 gives rise to a conservation law .",
    "the conserved quantity@xcite , resembling canonical angular momentum , ensures each particle can only drift a distance on the order of a gyroradius away from a given flux surface , implying omnigenity .    while every quasisymmetric field is omnigenous , not every omnigenous field is quasisymmetric .",
    "a proof by cary and shasharina at first appears to show the opposite conclusion , that a field which is both infinitely differentiable ( analytic ) and perfectly omnigenous must be quasisymmetric @xcite .",
    "however , the same authors point out that the proof is quite fragile : an analytic field that deviates from omnigenity only slightly may depart from quasisymmetry by a great amount .",
    "( we will construct examples of such fields in section [ sec : construction ] . ) thus , in practice , omnigenity does not imply quasisymmetry .",
    "consequently , to achieve good collisionless particle confinement , there is no need to strive for the strict condition of quasisymmetry when the weaker condition of omnigenity is sufficient .",
    "while it is possible to find three - dimensional mhd equilibria that are reasonably close to quasisymmetry@xcite , lifting the demand of quasisymmetry widens the parameter space , allowing stellarators to be better optimized for other criteria .",
    "one may still aim to achieve quasisymmetry for a different reason : in non - quasisymmetric plasmas , the parallel flow is determined by leading - order neoclassical processes , while in quasisymmetric plasmas , the parallel flow is determined by turbulence@xcite . as flows and flow shear may affect mhd modes and microinstabilities , quasisymmetric plasmas may have unique stability and turbulence properties , though more research is required to explore this notion .",
    "quasisymmetric fields provide an important and useful ideal limit for understanding nonaxisymmetric plasmas . in quasisymmetric fields ,",
    "concise analytic expressions can be derived for the neoclassical distribution function , radial fluxes , and parallel flows and current @xcite .",
    "these formulae are nearly identical to the corresponding formulae for a tokamak .",
    "the formulae are explicit , in that they do not involve solutions of partial differential equations .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding formulae for a general stellarator must be expressed in terms of the solutions of partial differential equations involving the field strength @xcite .",
    "one example is the system of equations ( [ eqb2])-([eqb5 ] ) for the bootstrap current .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that perfect omnigenity is another useful ideal limit .",
    "omnigenity , while less restrictive than quasisymmetry , is still a strong enough condition to place powerful constraints on @xmath3 .",
    "for example @xcite , in the neighborhood of each minimum and maximum of @xmath1 along a field line , each adjacent field line segment on the flux surface has an extremum at the same value of @xmath1 , as we will show in section [ sec : bproperties ] using novel arguments .",
    "we will also show that field lines can never be parallel to the contours of @xmath1 on each flux surface , and these contours must topologically link the flux surface toroidally , poloidally , or both . by defining integers @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the number of times",
    "each contour links the plasma toroidally and poloidally respectively , the helical  mode numbers \" @xmath20 and @xmath21 in ( [ eq1 ] ) can be generalized to any omnigenous plasma . using this generalization",
    ", we will show in section [ sec : paralleltransport ] that formulae for the bootstrap current and flux - surface - averaged parallel flow in a quasisymmetric plasma in fact apply to the larger class of _ all _ omnigenous plasmas .",
    "the formulae for the pfirsch - schlter  flow and current in a quasisymmetric plasma also apply to all omnigenous plasmas if a new term is added , consisting of an integral of derivatives of @xmath1 .",
    "the same is true of the low - collisionality distribution functions .",
    "some of these neoclassical properties were discussed previously in refs .",
    ", , and for the specific case of generalized poloidal symmetry ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "here we give more general calculations that apply to omnigenity of any helicity . in refs .",
    "and it was pointed out that for an @xmath2 omnigenous plasma , the bootstrap current vanishes unless there is inductive or rf - driven current .",
    "this result will be recovered from the analysis of general - helicity omnigenous fields here .",
    "another interesting feature of omnigenous magnetic fields that we will demonstrate concerns the radial electric field @xmath28 . in a general stellarator ,",
    "the radial electron and ion particle fluxes exhibit different dependencies on @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , it is possible to determine the electric field using the condition that the net radial current must vanish , i.e. quasineutrality or ambipolarity .",
    "however , this procedure fails in tokamaks or in quasisymmetric stellarators , which possess the property of  intrinsic ambipolarity . \"",
    "this is the property that to leading order in the expansion of gyroradius to system size , the net radial current vanishes regardless of the radial electric field , and so the electric field is determined by higher - order processes that are more difficult to calculate .",
    "an omnigenous plasma that is far from quasisymmetry will not be intrinsically ambipolar , and so it is still possible to solve for @xmath28 using ambipolarity . in section [ sec : er ]",
    "we will derive @xmath28 for any omnigenous , non - quasisymmetric field .",
    "the result differs from previously known expressions for the electric field in non - omnigenous stellarators .",
    "our calculation will also show from a new perspective that @xmath28 indeed becomes undetermined in the limit of quasisymmetry .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : construction ] , we will derive some further geometric properties of @xmath3 for an omnigenous flux surface .",
    "it will be shown how to generate a family of omnigenous flux surfaces that are consistent with an additional symmetry usually possessed by stellarator experiments .",
    "let us now begin to analyze the geometric properties of omnigenous fields in detail .",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the nearest minimum and maximum of @xmath1 found by moving forward and backward along a field line from the starting position @xmath31 . in a general stellarator , @xmath32 and @xmath33 will take on a continua of values ( or several continua ) on each flux surface .",
    "however , in an omnigenous field we will now show that @xmath32 and @xmath33 may only take on _ discrete _ values on each flux surface , and in the simplest case , each has only a single value on each flux surface .",
    "in other words , in the neighborhood of an extremum of @xmath1 along a field line , each nearby field line segment on the same flux surface has an extremum at the same value of @xmath1 .",
    "let us first prove this property for the minimum @xmath32 .",
    "we begin by recalling the contravariant and covariant expressions@xcite for @xmath1 in terms of the poloidal boozer angle @xmath34 and the toroidal boozer angle @xmath35 : @xmath36 @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the rotational transform , @xmath39 is @xmath40 times the toroidal current inside the flux surface @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is @xmath40 times the poloidal current outside the flux surface @xmath41 . now let @xmath43 denote a point at which @xmath1 is minimized with respect to movement along a field line . at this point , @xmath44 must vanish , so @xmath45 if the field is omnigenous , deeply trapped particles at @xmath46 must have no radial drift . as @xmath47 , then @xmath48 equations ( [ eq : par0 ] ) and ( [ eq : drift0 ] )",
    "are a system of two linearly independent equations for @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath46 , so both of these derivatives must be zero .",
    "the vanishing of these derivatives implies @xmath51 is either an isolated local minimum , a saddle point , or one point along a  valley \" of constant @xmath32 .",
    "the first two of these three possibilities can be excluded as follows .",
    "we first taylor - expand @xmath52 where @xmath53_0 $ ] , @xmath54_0 $ ] , @xmath55_0 $ ] , and the zero subscripts indicate quantities evaluated at @xmath46 . considering the variation of @xmath1 along the nearby field line @xmath56 for some small @xmath57 , by eliminating either @xmath34 or @xmath35 in ( [ eq : taylor ] ) and completing the square , it is evident that @xmath1 is minimized along the field line at the point @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . plugging the definitions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 into ( [ eq : taylor ] ) gives @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath1 is minimized along the shifted field line at @xmath66 , the radial drift must vanish there , for the same reason it had to vanish at @xmath46 , so @xmath67 and @xmath68 at @xmath66 .",
    "consequently the third and fourth right - hand - side terms in ( [ eq : shiftedtaylor ] ) ( those linear in @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) must vanish , and so @xmath71 must be zero .",
    "thus , the second term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : shiftedtaylor ] ) vanishes , and so the minimum of @xmath1 along the shifted field line is @xmath72 , the same as the minimum on the original field line .",
    "this proves the desired result for @xmath32 .",
    "this fact , that deeply trapped particles are perfectly confined when all @xmath32 on a flux surface are the same , was first observed in ref . .",
    "now we make the analogous argument for @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath46 now represent a point at which @xmath1 is maximized along a field line .",
    "the bounce time diverges for barely trapped particles , because they spend an infinitely long time near the turning points .",
    "thus , if there is an outward radial drift at @xmath46 , marginally trapped particles there will have an arbitrarily large radial excursion .",
    "even if these particles would in principle make a large inward radial step at the opposite bounce point , they would drift out of the machine before having time to get to the other bounce point , so these particles effectively would have a nonzero time - averaged radial drift .",
    "we choose to include in the definition of omnigenity the condition that marginally trapped particles can not have radial steps of unbounded size in this manner .",
    "now suppose at @xmath46 there were an _ inward _ radial drift .",
    "by omnigenity , marginally trapped particles must make an arbitrarily large outward excursion elsewhere in the trajectory to balance the arbitrarily large inward excursion in the neighborhood of @xmath46 , so this case too is unacceptable .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 must vanish at @xmath46 , implying ( [ eq : drift0 ] ) .",
    "the rest of the argument for the constancy of @xmath32 then applies , and so @xmath33 must be constant as well for each field line in a neighborhood of @xmath46 on the flux surface .    due to these constraints on the extrema of @xmath1 ,",
    "omnigenous fields represent an intermediate level of complexity between quasisymmetric fields and general nonaxisymmetric fields .",
    "figure [ fig : balongfieldline ] illustrates this point . for axisymmetric and quasisymmetric fields , the @xmath1 wells in which particle are trapped all have identical shape . at the opposite extreme of a general three - dimensional field , different field line segments have different maxima and minima of @xmath1 .",
    "omnigenous fields represent a middle ground .",
    "maxima of @xmath1 occur repeatedly at the same values of @xmath1 , and the same is true of the minima . in fact",
    ", we will prove in section [ sec : bmaxisstraight ] that the maxima are equally spaced ( in @xmath34 , in @xmath35 , and in distance along the field ) , as indicated by the horizontal red arrows in figure [ fig : balongfieldline ] . yet , unlike in quasisymmetric fields , the shape of the @xmath1 wells is different at different points along a field line .    ]      in an omnigenous toroidal field , the constant-@xmath1 contours on a flux surface must all encircle the plasma toroidally , poloidally , or both .",
    "in other words , each contour must topologically link the flux surface : a contour can not be continuously deformable ( homotopic ) to a point without leaving the flux surface . if any constant-@xmath1 contour did not link the flux surface in this manner , then the contour would enclose a _ point _",
    "maximum or minimum of @xmath1 within the surface , and we just proved that such point extrema can not occur in an omnigenous field . as an illustration , the bold curve in figure [ fig : nonomni ] is a @xmath1 contour that does not link the plasma .",
    "this contour encloses a point minimum or maximum of @xmath3 at @xmath73 , and such points can not exist in an omnigenous field .",
    "for contrast , figure [ fig : b ] depicts an omnigenous field , one in which the @xmath1 contours encircle the plasma both poloidally and toroidally .",
    "figure [ fig : b2 ] shows an omnigenous field with toroidally closed @xmath1 contours .",
    "neither field has any point extrema of @xmath1 .     on a flux surface of a non - omnigenous stellarator .",
    "contours typically exist that do not topologically link the flux surface , such as the bold contour here .",
    "the bold black straight line is a field line .",
    "[ fig : nonomni ] ]     for two of the four periods of an omnigenous field with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",

    "field lines are parallel to the arrow .",
    "one branch is shaded and the other is unshaded .",

    "the arrows point along @xmath27 and connect two contours of equal @xmath1 .",
    "the conditions @xmath79 and @xmath80 imply the arrows must have the same length .",
    "[ fig : b2 ] ]    we can also prove that all @xmath1 contours must encircle the plasma using the following alternative argument . if a constant-@xmath1 contour does not link the flux surface , then there will be points at which the contour is tangent to the field , such as point @xmath81 in figure [ fig : nonomni ] .",
    "( recall that field lines are straight in the @xmath82 plane for boozer coordinates . ) at such a point of tengency , @xmath83 , but the derivative of @xmath1 in any other direction on the flux surface is nonzero .",
    "thus , ( [ eq : par0 ] ) is satisfied while ( [ eq : drift0 ] ) is not , violating the condition of omnigenity .",
    "physically , if @xmath1 is a minimum along the field line at @xmath81 , deeply trapped particles at @xmath81 will have nonzero average radial drift , while if @xmath1 is a maximum along the field line at @xmath81 , barely trapped particles will make an infinite radial step when they bounce at @xmath81 .",
    "neither type of radial motion is allowed in an omnigenous field , so the @xmath1 contours of each flux surface in an omnigenous field can never be tangent to field lines .",
    "this implies the contours must link the plasma .",
    "it can be seen in figures [ fig : b ] and [ fig : b2 ] that the @xmath1 contours are indeed nowhere tangent to the field lines .",
    "we can now define integers @xmath20 and @xmath21 as follows : each @xmath1 contour closes on itself after traversing the torus @xmath20 times toroidally and @xmath21 times poloidally , that is , after @xmath84 increases by @xmath85 and @xmath86 increases by @xmath87 .",
    "this convention may seem backward at first , but it is consistent with the @xmath20 and @xmath21 defined earlier for a quasisymmetric field : @xmath88 . by defining @xmath20 and @xmath21 in terms of the topology of the @xmath1 contours as we have done ,",
    "the helicity associated with quasisymmetric fields is generalized to any omnigenous field .",
    "notice that this helicity is completely independent of the rotational transform @xmath38 .",
    "it should be noted that definition of the term  quasi - isodynamic \" given by some authors@xcite is equivalent to the condition  omnigenous with @xmath2 .",
    "\" however , other authors@xcite define  quasi - isodynamic \" differently , as the case in which only particles with a particular value of normalized magnetic moment @xmath89 are omnigenous , not all particles .",
    "next , it will be convenient to define a field line label @xmath90 by @xmath91 this definition is convenient because if a constant-@xmath1 curve is followed until it closes on itself , then @xmath90 will increase by @xmath92 .",
    "for much of the analysis that follows we will use @xmath93 coordinates . in these coordinates the magnetic field has a contravariant form @xmath94 and a covariant form @xmath95 the jacobian is @xmath96 .",

    "the black arrows illustrate the toroidal and poloidal currents , which are the currents through the red and blue translucent surfaces respectively .",

    "as described above , @xmath108 increases by @xmath92 along this curve . from ampre s law , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the current linked by the loop , and the integrals are performed at constant @xmath111 and @xmath1 .",
    "the integration path links the torus @xmath21 times poloidally and @xmath20 times poloidally , so the amount of current linked by this helical curve is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the toroidal current inside the flux surface and @xmath114 is the poloidal current outside the flux surface .",
    "these currents are related to the coefficients of the boozer covariant representation by @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "therefore @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this application of ampre s law is illustrated in figure [ fig : ampere ] ( for @xmath74 and @xmath75 . )",
    "any single - valued function of position must be periodic in @xmath108 ( with period @xmath119 if @xmath1 is held fixed .",
    "in particular , @xmath120 must be periodic in this way , so we can write @xmath121 for some single - valued @xmath122 .",
    "hence , recalling ( [ eq6 ] ) , we obtain the useful formula @xmath123    in the quasisymmetric limit @xmath124 , then the left - hand side of this expression can be computed directly , and the result is the same but without the @xmath122 term .",
    "thus , quasisymmetry corresponds to the @xmath125 limit .",
    "the continuous coordinates @xmath126 do not uniquely determine a point in space , both because there may be multiple toroidal segments , but also because within each segment there are two points at given @xmath1 on either side of @xmath32 , the minimum of @xmath1 on the flux surface .",
    "this discrete degree of freedom , called the ",

    "the variations of @xmath1 in the two branches are related due to the condition of omnigenity .",
    "as shown in appendix [ a : proofs ] , @xmath128 this result was derived using different notation in ref . and is termed the  cary - shasharina theorem \" in ref . .",

    "but since @xmath130^{-1 } db'$ ] ( i.e. @xmath131 is evaluated at @xmath132 rather than @xmath1 ) , then ( [ eq15 ] ) implies @xmath133 in an omnigenous field .",

    "a similar proof shows the separation in @xmath34 between the points is also independent of field line .",
    "the results @xmath139 and @xmath140 are illustrated by the three arrows in figure [ fig : b2 ] .",

    "the rotational transform @xmath38 can be assumed to be irrational , since by continuity , @xmath1 on any rational surface can differ only infinitesimally from @xmath1 on a nearby irrational surface . to begin the rigorous proof ,",

    "let one @xmath33 contour be given by @xmath145 .",
    "if we shift this contour by @xmath143 and @xmath142 , it must lie on top of the next @xmath33 contour , the one given by @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , @xmath147 .",
    "then expanding @xmath148 as the fourier series @xmath149 , we can write @xmath150 the @xmath151 component of this equation implies @xmath152 .",
    "it follows that the exponent @xmath153 will never be an integer multiple of @xmath154 if @xmath38 is irrational .",
    "therefore , the quantity in parentheses in ( [ eq20 m ] ) can never be zero for @xmath155 .",
    "every @xmath156 component of ( [ eq20 m ] ) consequently implies @xmath157 , so @xmath158 must be constant , meaning the @xmath33 contours are straight . to apply the proof to fields in which both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are nonzero , all that is needed is to redefine @xmath158 as @xmath159 along the @xmath33 contour so @xmath148 remains periodic in @xmath34 .",
    "the proof can also be adapted to the @xmath77 case by switching the roles of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    finally , it is important to consider both branches when forming the flux surface average in the @xmath160 coordinate system . for any quantity @xmath161",

    "it can be immediately verified that ( [ inversess ] ) is indeed satisfied .",
    "similarly , if @xmath422 , then the left - hand side of ( [ inversess ] ) is given by the bottom line of ( [ eq : zetaofeta ] ) , while the right - hand side of ( [ inversess ] ) is given by the top line of ( [ eq : zetaofeta ] ) , and the satisfaction of ( [ inversess ] ) is immediate .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath441 is independent of field line . to see this , consider two points @xmath424 and @xmath423 on the same field line and at the same @xmath1 but on opposite sides of @xmath32 .",

    ", it can be seen that a consistent solution of the system is @xmath450 .",
    "therefore @xmath451 is independent of @xmath378 for each @xmath1 , so the magnetic field is omnigenous .    given that @xmath38 is rarely much larger than 1 in experiments , it is difficult to construct @xmath77 omnigenous fields that depart strongly from quasisymmetry .",
    "this is because the @xmath1 contours in a @xmath77 quasisymmetric field are already nearly parallel to the field lines when @xmath452 .",
    "even a slight curvature of the @xmath1 contours would result in points of tangency to the field lines , and as discussed in section [ sec : helicity ] , the @xmath1 contours and field lines can never be tangent in omnigenous fields .",
    "the limit of a single - helicity ( i.e. quasisymmetric ) field is a useful point of reference for insight into stellarator physics , for in these effectively 2d fields , analytic calculations can be carried out more completely than in a general stellarator . in the preceding sections , we have shown that omnigenous plasmas ought to be another such point of reference .",
    "many geometrical and physical properties of omnigenous plasmas are either identical to the associated quantity in a quasisymmetric plasma , or else obtained by the addition of one term that is strongly constrained . while every quasisymmetric field is omnigenous , in practice",
    "not every omnigenous field is quasisymmetric .",
    "therefore a broader attention to the larger class of omnigenous fields may allow better optimization for other criteria such as smaller aspect ratio or coil simplicity .",
    "furthermore , it is omnigenity and not quasisymmetry that is the necessary condition for confinement of alpha particles . any viable fusion reactor will need to be nearly omnigenous in order to prevent damage to the first wall from unconfined alphas . indeed , alpha particle confinement time is routinely used as an optimization criterion in stellarator design codes . as alpha confinement becomes increasingly important in future reactor - relevant experiments ,",
    "stellarator designs can be expected to more closely approach omnigenity .",
    "the recent design study in ref .",
    "gives one example of a nearly omnigenous device .    in section [ sec",
    ": bproperties ] , novel proofs were given of various geometric properties of omnigenous magnetic fields .",
    "the @xmath1 contours must link the flux surface toroidally , poloidally , or both , so no isolated extrema of @xmath1 on the flux surface are allowed .",
    "the field lines can never be tangent to the @xmath1 contours",
    ". the curve of @xmath33 ( the maximum of @xmath1 ) must be straight in boozer coordinates .",
    "the variation of @xmath1 on the two branches is constrained by ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "the integers @xmath20 and @xmath21 usually defined by the quasisymmetry relation @xmath88 may be generalized to any omnigenous field by redefining them as the number of times each @xmath1 contour encircles the plasma toroidally and poloidally . in ( [ eq13 ] ) , it was shown that the ratio @xmath453 , which arises repeatedly in transport calculations , may be written as a sum of a quasisymmetric part and a departure from quasisymmetry , @xmath164 .",
    "this same division into quasisymmetric and non - quasisymmetric components also arises in physical quantities .",
    "the pfirsch - schlter  flow and current ( [ eq59 ] ) and ( [ eq62 ] ) are given by the same formulae as in a quasisymmetric device , with the addition of the @xmath229 term , which is an integral of @xmath1 along field lines .",
    "in contrast , the pfirsch - schlter  flow and current in a general stellarator can only be expressed in terms of the solution of a partial differential equation like ( [ eq45 ] ) . the distribution function in a low - collisionality omnigenous plasma",
    "is given by the distribution function in a quasisymmetric plasma of the same helicity , plus the term @xmath454 .",
    "this term does not contribute to the average parallel flow @xmath455 and bootstrap current @xmath240 , so these quantities are given by exactly the same expressions as in a quasisymmetric plasma .",
    "for each of the quantities discussed above , formulae for a quasisymmetric plasma can be recovered by setting @xmath456 , and tokamak formulae can be recovered by also setting @xmath457 and @xmath458 .",
    "in general , a self - consistent current profile may be found by calculating the current density in term of the total current using kinetic theory , and then writing the current density as the appropriate derivative ( [ aj : eq6m])-([aj : eq7 ] ) of the total current . when @xmath2 , corresponding to generalized quasi - poloidal symmetry , the resulting self - consistent configuration has no bootstrap current .",
    "such configurations have several desirable properties owing to the minimization of current driven by pressure",
    ". the magnetic field would remain omnigenous over a larger range of plasma pressure .",
    "also , the equilibrium @xmath459 limit may be less severe and current - driven instability may be reduced .",
    "the property of omnigenous plasmas that is most fundamentally different from quasisymmetric plasmas is the radial electric field .",
    "omnigenous plasmas that are not quasisymmetric are not intrinsically ambipolar .",
    "the radial electric field @xmath28 is therefore determined by low - order neoclassical physics , so it is possible to solve for @xmath28 using the ambipolarity condition . the closed - form expression ( [ eq106 ] )",
    "gives the resulting radial electric field for low collisionality .",
    "the formula is independent of the details of the magnetic field geometry .    in every stellarator experiment to date ,",
    "detailed numerical neoclassical calculations@xcite find a @xmath17 regime of radial transport to exist , indicating that departures from omnigenity are non - negligible for radial transport in realistic experiments .",
    "thus , the results in section [ sec : er ] are likely to be applicable only for benchmarking numerical codes , since in codes the @xmath3 pattern can be made more perfectly omnigenous than in a true 3d equilibrium . however , unlike the radial transport , the parallel flow and current are carried by the bulk of the distribution function , not by a small fraction of trapped particles .",
    "therefore , the formulae derived in this paper for the flow and current are robust to small departures from omnigenity .",
    "this resilience is aided by the fact that any @xmath17 part of the distribution function would be even in @xmath460 and so it would carry no flow .    in conclusion",
    ", omnigenity is a useful ideal limit for gaining insight and benchmarking codes : omnigenity is experimentally relevant , it is more inclusive than quasisymmetry , and yet it allows explicit analytic results to be derived that are nearly as concise as results for quasisymmetric or axisymmetric plasmas .",
    "this work was supported by the us department of energy through grant de - fg02 - 91er-54109 and through the fusion energy postdoctoral research program administered by the oak ridge institute for science and education .",
    "in this appendix we will first prove the equivalence of the two definitions of omnigenity : 1 ) the bounce - averaged radial drift vanishes , and 2 ) the longitudinal adiabatic invariant is a flux function .",
    "then , we will derive ( [ eq15 ] ) .",

    "is then applied , using the coordinates @xmath462 , where @xmath463 is a field line label , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are any straight - field - line poloidal and toroidal angles ( so @xmath464 ) . noting that the inverse jacobian is @xmath465 and that @xmath466 , we thereby obtain @xmath467.\\ ] ] next , we define the bounce average , which for any quantity @xmath203 is @xmath468 , where @xmath469 , @xmath470 , and @xmath471 and @xmath472 are the two bounce points ( at which @xmath473 ) . the integrals in the bounce average are performed at constant @xmath474 .",

    "now , consider the longitudinal invariant for trapped particles : @xmath477 , where the integration is again carried out along a full bounce . using @xmath478 in this definition , then we obtain @xmath479 consequently , the bounce - averaged radial drift vanishes if and only if the longitudinal invariant @xmath480 is a flux function , and so the two definitions of omnigenity are equivalent .",
    "now we move on to the proof that @xmath481 in an omnigenous field @xcite .",
    "we first note that @xmath482 .",
