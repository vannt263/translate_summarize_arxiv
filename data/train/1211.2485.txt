    "sequential or joint nonprojective measurements can reveal the quantum nature of the detectors .",
    "for example , the pioneering work of arthurs and kelly @xcite demonstrated how two weak measurements of momentum and position could be carried out simultaneously , and how the uncertainty principle obeyed by the detectors ( or probes ) showed up in their mutual back - action . while the theory of positive operator - valued ( pov ) measures ( of which the weak and the strong measurements are particular cases ) has its mathematical roots in the seminal papers of neumark @xcite and has been developed since the 70s @xcite , only in 1988 was it realized that a weak measurement followed by a strong one could lead to arbitrarily large values of the average output  @xcite , provided that the weak measurement is conditioned on the result of the strong one .",
    "this conditioning is called postselection .",
    "as postselected weak measurements can give an arbitrarily large average output ( even for non - orthogonal preparation and postselection @xcite ) , they have been used to amplify a weak signal @xcite , to settle fundamental issues  such as determining the traversal time of a barrier @xcite , solving hardy s paradox @xcite , and observing quantum trajectories @xcite and also to perform quantum state tomography @xcite . concerning the last application",
    ", there are several proposals @xcite for extending the procedure to mixed states .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that having a stream of particles sent to probes initially prepared to measure in the strong regime can create coherence in the probes ; this drives the measurement to the weak regime and is reflected in a deviation of the statistics from that predicted for projective measurement , provided the decoherence rate of the probes does not exceed the firing rate of the particles . for other applications and studies of the weak measurement ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the theoretical papers on postselected weak measurements are mostly limited to the study of the average value and assume an instantaneous ( von neumann ) interaction . while for optical implementations postulating an instantaneous interaction is reasonable , for the still prospective realizations in solid - state systems ( see the proposals @xcite ) it is more realistic to suppose a coupling that lasts a finite time .",
    "in an earlier paper @xcite , we introduced a finite - duration interaction , assuming only that the measurement was a quantum nondemolition one @xcite .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , were limited to the average value of the output and its variance ( barring the case study of a spin 1/2 , for which , since an exact solution exists , the expansion in the weak coupling was made merely to test its validity ) . in a more recent paper @xcite",
    ", one of us studied the whole statistics of the weak measurement , by performing a controlled expansion in the coupling strength , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and providing an interpolation formula that works for any preparation and postselection . here",
    ", we provide the statistics of a nondemolition weak measurement of an arbitrary variable .",
    "we show that the finite duration has observable consequences , since in a weak measurement the coherence of the probe manifests through the contribution of its density matrix off - diagonal elements ( in the readout basis ) , and since the interaction contributes dynamical phases to these elements .",
    "let us consider a quantum system prepared , at time @xmath0 , in a state @xmath1 ( preselection ) and a second quantum system , the probe , prepared , at time @xmath2 , in a state @xmath3 .",
    "let the hamiltonian of the system be @xmath4 , and that of the probe @xmath5 .",
    "the system and the probe interact , at time @xmath6 , through @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an operator on the system s hilbert space , @xmath9 on the probe s , and @xmath10 is a function that vanishes outside a finite interval @xmath11 $ ] , with @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction generates a time - evolution operator @xmath13 that acts on the hilbert space of the system and the probe , entangling the two .",
    "let the operator @xmath14 be the conjugate observable for the write - in and readout variables , these need not be literal position and wave number .",
    "many authors use @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "] of @xmath9 , @xmath18=i$ ] .",
    "it follows from heisenberg s equations of motion , or even from hamilton s equations for the corresponding classical case , that @xmath14 is the observable of the probe that carries information about the measured quantity @xmath8 . as the interaction lasts a finite time",
    ", @xmath8 has to be be conserved , i.e. @xmath19=0 $ ] , otherwise the question would arise of what is being measured . , @xmath20",
    ", then we could allow @xmath21\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "] we notice that , in order for the measurement to be nondemolition , @xmath14 too must be conserved during the free evolution of the probe and change only due to the interaction with the observed system . hence @xmath22 . in other words",
    ", we are considering not a von neumann ( instantaneous ) weak measurement , but the more general nondemolition ( finite - duration ) weak measurement , having the former as a special limiting case . at time",
    "@xmath23 a projective measurement of the observable @xmath14 is made on the probe . as @xmath14 is conserved by @xmath5 , the value obtained will not depend on the time , as long as @xmath24 . in a strong nondemolition measurement , it is furthermore assumed that the probe is prepared in a state such that the elements @xmath25 are negligible unless @xmath26 , where the function @xmath27 maps the values of @xmath28 to the readout .",
    "this hypothesis guarantees the fidelity of the measurement , as well as its repeatability .",
    "however , as we are interested in the weak regime , we drop this assumption .",
    "at time @xmath29 , a projective measurement of an observable @xmath30 of the system is made , giving an output @xmath31 and leaving the system in the state @xmath32 .",
    "then , given @xmath31 , one keeps the outcome @xmath33 according to an arbitrarily chosen probability @xmath34 .",
    "this step leaves the system in the postselected mixed state @xmath35 the procedure detailed above and sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , describes a measurement with pre- and postselection . without loss of generality",
    ", we shall consider @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the duration of the interaction .     a schematic view of the measurement with pre- and postselection , the horizontal direction representing increasing time . a random number generator yields @xmath39 after each trial .",
    "if @xmath40 the outcome is considered . , width=672,height=288 ]    we notice that @xmath41 is not necessarily 1 as @xmath34 are probabilities _ conditional _ on the event @xmath31 , not probabilities _ of _ the event . if the system has a finite - dimension hilbert space , with @xmath42 the dimension , then @xmath43 . for @xmath44",
    "if @xmath45 and 0 otherwise , the postselection is in the pure state @xmath46 . in this case , @xmath47 is a sub - optimal choice , in the sense that some of the trials are discarded unnecessarily .",
    "the opposite limit is found for @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that no postselection is made , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "the optimal choice is @xmath50 .",
    "if all the probabilities are multiplied by the same factor @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the postselected state is unchanged , but the probability of a successful postselection is also multiplied by @xmath51 , and so is the joint probability of observing the probe in @xmath53 and successfully post - selecting the system . thus the conditional probability , given by the ratio of the two probabilities above , is unaffected by this rescaling .",
    "the optimal choice of @xmath51 is such that it maximizes the probability of postselection , namely @xmath54=1 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath55 , with the equality only for postselection in a pure state . in a sense",
    ", we could say that the probabilistic postselection leaves the system in the unnormalized state @xmath56 .",
    "another proposed method @xcite is to make the postselecting measurement a pov one .",
    "this way @xmath57 is replaced by a positive operator @xmath58 . however , while @xmath58 appears in the probabilities , as e.g. in eq .",
    "below , the system is not selected in a state @xmath59 but in @xmath60 , with @xmath61 its reduced density matrix after the interaction with the probe .",

    "the joint probability of observing the outcome @xmath33 at time @xmath72 for the probe and of postselecting the system in @xmath57 at time @xmath73 , follows readily from eqs .   and :",
    "@xmath74 }   \\label{eq : instgenprob } \\rho_0(k-\\lambda a , k-\\lambda a ' ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a von neumann measurement , @xmath75 .",
    "the conditional probability of observing the outcome @xmath33 , given that the state has been postselected in @xmath76 , follows from bayes s rule , @xmath77 where the denominator @xmath78 represents the probability of making a successful postselection in @xmath76 , irrespective of the value of @xmath33 , or of what observable of the probe , if any , was measured .",
    "what remains to be done is simple : apply the controlled expansion of both @xmath79 and @xmath80 in @xmath81 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the difference that here one should keep track of additional contributions from the dynamical phases @xmath82 .",
    "it is fundamental to keep in mind that , both in @xmath83 and in @xmath84 , the zeroth and first order terms vanish for nearly orthogonal pre- and postselected states ( nopps ) .",
    "thus one should write down @xmath85 as the ratio of two quadratic polynomials in @xmath81 , without succumbing to the temptation to expand the denominator .",
    "before proceeding to the expansion , we introduce the normal weak values as in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath86 we note that @xmath87 , so that @xmath88 are real . for nopps , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 for @xmath92 ; also , @xmath93 for @xmath94 . while there can be exceptions to this behavior when @xmath95 for some integer @xmath96 , in any case @xmath97 stays finite for nopps , barring some trivial instances .",
    "this consideration is important , as @xmath97 provides the dominant term to both @xmath84 and @xmath83 for nopps .",
    "we shall also use the phase - space averages @xcite , @xmath98 , with @xmath99 the initial wigner function of the probe .",
    "in particular , we define the covariance @xmath100 . a natural concept arising in the expansion",
    "is that of phase - space conditional averages @xmath101 , defined by @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "the phase - space average of @xmath104 is found by integrating eq .   over @xmath33 .",
    "finally , we define the time scales @xmath105^n [ 1-h(s)]$ ] , which satisfy @xmath106 .",
    "as @xmath81 is a dimensionful constant , it has to be compared to some homogeneous quantity in order to establish whether the measurement is weak , strong , or intermediate .",
    "let @xmath107 be the coherence scale , i.e. , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 the classical uncertainty scale , i.e. , @xmath110 . precisely , we define @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the classical uncertainty of the conjugate variable of @xmath33 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "the uncertainty relation requires @xmath115 . in order to realize the weak ( coherent ) regime ,",
    "the coupling constant must be small compared to the coherence scale , precisely , @xmath116 , with @xmath117 the maximum distance between the eigenvalues of @xmath8 .",
    "the validity of the expansion relies also @xcite on @xmath118 .",
    "equation   shows that both the off - diagonal terms of the detector and the hamiltonian phase contribute to the statistics .",
    "thus we are in presence of interference .",
    "we also remark that if either @xmath119 or @xmath120 , i.e. , no postselection or no preselection is made , the coherent contributions disappear . hence ,",
    "both pre- and postselection are essential in order for interference to show up .",

    ", @xmath127 appears instead of @xmath38 . varies linearly in time for fixed @xmath28 ( uniformly accelerated motion ) .",
    "then @xmath128 , and the classical displacement is indeed @xmath129 .",
    "notice that the @xmath33 appearing in the formulas refers to the value at time @xmath38 , hence @xmath130 is the final velocity @xmath131 . ]",
    "since the second - order term contributes significantly only for nopps , we have neglected @xmath132 compared to @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , as all expressions are homogeneous in @xmath133 , we may reduce the number of independent parameters by dividing by , say , @xmath134 .",
    "accordingly , we introduce the canonical complex weak value @xmath135 and the additional real term @xmath136 .",

    "in particular , @xmath142 for pure pre- and postselected states .",

    "this way , the shifts of the probability distribution are lost . however , as in the weak regime the shifted peaks are not resolved , this yields a small deviation from the exact result .",

    "@xcite are recovered as a special case .",
    "as an effective model for decoherence , we consider a random classical force acting on the probe , while the latter interacts with the system . in principle , if the probe is prepared before the interaction starts , decoherence will tend to kill the off - diagonal elements @xmath158 , driving the measurement to the weak incoherent regime",
    ". however , this effect can be counteracted by preparing the probe shortly before its interaction with the system , and in any case it can be treated rather simply . on the other hand , decoherence during the interaction with the system is unavoidable , as the probe is open to external influences , which can come from the system and from the environment . for simplicity ,",
