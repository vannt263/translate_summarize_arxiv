    "recently , simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) becomes appealing by essentially providing a perpetual energy source for the wireless networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , the swipt system offers great convenience to mobile users , since it realizes both useful utilizations of radio signals to transfer energy as well as information .",
    "therefore , swipt has drawn an upsurge of research interests @xcite .",
    "varshney first proposed the idea of transmitting information and energy simultaneously in @xcite assuming that the receiver is able to decode information and harvest energy simultaneously from the same received signal .",
    "however , this assumption may not hold in practice , as circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly .",
    "two practical schemes for swipt , namely , time switching ( ts ) and power splitting ( ps ) , are proposed in @xcite . with ts applied at the receiver , the received signal",
    "is either processed by an energy receiver for energy harvesting ( eh ) or processed by an information receiver for information decoding ( i d ) . with ps",
    "applied at the receiver , the received signal is split into two signal streams with a fixed power ratio by a power splitter , with one stream to the energy receiver and the other one to the information receiver .",
    "swipt for multi - antenna systems has been considered in @xcite . in particular , @xcite studied the performance limits of a three - node multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) broadcasting system , where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information from the signals sent by a common transmitter .",
    "@xcite extended the work in @xcite by considering imperfect channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter for a multiple - input single - output ( miso ) system .",
    "a miso swipt system without csi at the transmitter was considered in @xcite , where a new scheme that employs random beamforming for opportunistic eh was proposed .",
    "@xcite studied a miso broadcasting system that exploits near - far channel conditions , where `` near '' users are scheduled for eh , while `` far '' users are scheduled for i d .",
    "swipt that exploits flat - fading channel variations was studied in @xcite , where the receiver performs dynamic time switching ( dts ) @xcite or dynamic power splitting ( dps ) @xcite to coordinate between eh and i d .",
    "swipt in multi - antenna interference channels was considered in @xcite using ps and ts , respectively .",
    "swipt with energy / information relaying has been studied in @xcite , where an energy - constrained relay harvests energy from the received signal and uses that harvested energy to forward the source information to the destination .",
    "two relaying protocols , i.e. , the ts - based relaying ( tsr ) protocol and the ps - based relaying ( psr ) protocol , are proposed in @xcite . in the tsr protocol",
    ", the relay spends a portion of time for eh and the remaining time for information processing . in the psr protocol",
    ", the relay spends a portion of the received power for eh and the remaining power for information processing .",
    "networks that involve wireless power transfer were studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied a hybrid network which overlays an uplink cellular network with randomly deployed power beacons that charge mobiles wirelessly . under an outage constraint on the data links ,",
    "the tradeoffs among the network parameters were derived . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigated a cognitive radio network powered by opportunistic wireless energy harvesting , where mobiles from the secondary network either harvest energy from nearby transmitters in a primary network , or transmit information if the primary transmitters are far away . under an outage constraint for coexisting networks",
    ", the throughput of the secondary network was maximized .",
    "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is a well established technology for high - rate wireless communications , and has been adopted in various standards , e.g. , ieee 802.11n and 3gpp - long term evolution ( lte ) .",
    "however , the performance may be limited by the availability of energy in the devices for some practical application scenarios .",
    "it thus motivates our investigation of swipt in ofdm - based systems .",
    "swipt over a single - user ofdm channel has been studied in @xcite assuming that the receiver is able to decode information and harvest energy simultaneously from the same received signal .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a tradeoff exists between the achievable rate and the transferred power by power allocation in the frequency bands : for sufficiently small transferred power , the optimal power allocation is given by the so - called `` waterfilling ( wf ) '' allocation to maximize the information transmission rate , whereas as the transferred power increases , more power needs to be allocated to the channels with larger channel gain and finally approaches the strategy with all power allocated to the channel with largest channel gain . however , due to the practical limitation that circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly , the result in @xcite actually provides only an upper bound for the rate - energy tradeoff in a single - user ofdm system .",
    "power control for swipt in a multiuser multi - antenna ofdm system was considered in @xcite , where the information decoder and energy harvester are attached to two separate antennas . in @xcite ,",
    "each user only harvests the energy carried by the subcarriers that are allocated to that user for i d , which is inefficient in energy utilization , since the energy carried by the subcarriers allocated to other users for i d can be potentially harvested .",
    "moreover , @xcite focuses on power control by assuming a predefined subcarrier allocation . in this paper",
    ", we jointly optimize the power allocation strategy as well as the subcarrier allocation strategy .",
    "@xcite considered swipt in a multiuser single - antenna ofdm system , where ps is applied at each receiver to coordinate between eh and i d . in @xcite , it is assumed that the splitting ratio can be different for different subcarriers .",
    "however , in practical circuits , ( analog ) power splitting is performed before ( digital ) ofdm demodulation .",
    "thus , for an ofdm - based swipt system , _ all _ subcarriers would have to be power split with the same power ratio at each receiver even though only a subset of the subcarriers contain information for the receiver .",
    "in contrast , for the case of a single - carrier system , a receiver simply harvests energy from all signals that do not contain information for this receiver .    as an extension of our previous work in @xcite for a single - user narrowband swipt system , in this paper , we study a multiuser ofdm - based swipt system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) , where a fixed access point ( ap ) with constant power supply broadcasts signals to a set of distributed users . unlike the conventional wireless network where all the users contain only information receiver and",
    "draw energy from their own power supplies , in our model , it is assumed that each user contains an additional energy receiver to harvest energy from the received signals from the ap .",
    "for the information transmission , two conventional multiple access schemes are considered , namely , time division multiple access ( tdma ) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) . for the tdma - based information transmission ,",
    "since the users are scheduled in nonoverlapping time slots to decode information , each user should apply ts such that the information receiver is used during the time slot when information is scheduled for that user , while the energy receiver is used in all other time slots . for the ofdma - based information transmission",
    ", we assume that ps is applied at each receiver .",
    "as mentioned in the previous paragraph , we assume that all subcarriers share the same power splitting ratio at each receiver . under the tdma scenario",
    ", we address the problem of maximizing the weighted sum - rate over all users by varying the power allocation in time and frequency and the ts ratios , subject to a minimum harvested energy constraint on each user and a peak and/or total transmission power constraint . by an appropriate variable transformation",
    "the problem is reformulated as a convex problem , for which the optimal power allocation and ts ratios are obtained by the lagrange duality method . for the ofdma scenario",
    ", we address the same problem by varying the power allocation in frequency , the subcarrier allocation to users and the ps ratios . in this case",
    ", we propose an efficient algorithm to iteratively optimize the power and subcarrier allocation , and the ps ratios at receivers until the convergence is reached .",
    "furthermore , we compare the rate - energy performances by the two proposed schemes , both numerically by simulations and analytically for the special case of single - user system setup .",
    "it is revealed that the peak power constraint imposed on each ofdm subcarrier as well as the number of users in the system play key roles in the rate - energy performance comparison by the two proposed schemes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] presents the system model and problem formulations .",
    "section [ sec : solution - single ] studies the special case of a single - user ofdm - based swipt system .",
    "section [ sec : solution ] derives the resource allocation solutions for the two proposed schemes in the multiuser ofdm - based swipt system .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig : system ] , we consider a downlink ofdm - based system with one transmitter and @xmath0 users .",
    "the transmitter and all users are each equipped with one antenna .",
    "the total bandwidth of the system is equally divided into @xmath1 subcarriers ( scs ) .",
    "the sc set is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the power allocated to sc @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "assume that the total transmission power is at most @xmath5 .",
    "the maximum power allocated to each sc is denoted by @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "the channel power gain of sc @xmath3 as seen by the user @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "we consider a slow - fading environment , where all the channels are assumed to be constant within the transmission scheduling period of our interest . for simplicity , we assume the total transmission time to be one .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the channel gains on all the scs for all the users are known at the transmitter . at the receiver side",
    ", each user performs eh in addition to i d .",
    "it is assumed that the minimum harvested energy during the unit transmission time is @xmath11 for user @xmath12 .",
    "we first consider the case of tdma - based information transmission with ts applied at each receiver .",
    "it is worth noting that for a single - user swipt system with ts applied at the receiver , the transmission time needs to be divided into two time slots to coordinate the eh and i d processes at the receiver .",
    "thus , in the swipt system with @xmath0 users , we consider @xmath13 time slots without loss of generality , where the additional time slot , which we called the _ power _ slot , may be allocated for all users to perform eh only .",
    "in contrast , in conventional tdma systems without eh , the power slot is not required .",
    "we assume that slot @xmath12 is assigned to user @xmath9 for transmitting information , while slot @xmath13 is the power slot . with total time duration of @xmath13 slots to be at",
    "most one , the ( normalized ) time duration for slot @xmath14 is variable and denoted by the ts ratio @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the power @xmath18 allocated to sc @xmath3 at slot @xmath9 is specified as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the average transmit power constraint is thus given by @xmath21    consider user @xmath22 at the receiver side , user @xmath9 decodes its intended information at slot @xmath9 when its information is sent and harvests energy during all the other slots @xmath23 .",
    "the receiver noise at each user is assumed to be independent over scs and is modelled as a circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath24 at all scs .",
    "moreover , the gap for the achievable rate from the channel capacity due to a practical modulation and coding scheme ( mcs ) is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the achievable rate in bps / hz for the information receiver of user @xmath9 is thus given by @xmath26 assuming that the conversion efficiency of the energy harvesting process at each receiver is denoted by @xmath27 , the harvested energy in joule at the energy receiver of user @xmath9 is thus given by @xmath28    an example of the energy utilization at receivers for the ts case in a two - user ofdm - based swipt system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pa - ts ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pa - ts](a ) for user 1 , the received energy on all scs during slot 1 is utilized for i d ; while the received energy on all scs during slot 2 and slot 3 is utilized for eh . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pa - ts](b ) for user 2 , the received energy on all scs during slot 2 is utilized for i d ; while the received energy on all scs during slot 1 and slot 3 is utilized for eh .",
    "our objective is to maximize the weighted sum - rate of all users by varying the transmission power in the time and frequency domains jointly with ts ratios , subject to eh constraints and the transmission power constraints .",
    "thus , the following optimization problem is formulated .",
    "@xmath29    where @xmath30 denotes the non - negative rate weight assigned to user @xmath9 .",
    "problem ( p - ts ) is feasible when all the constraints in problem ( p - ts ) can be satisfied by some @xmath31 .",
    "from ( [ eq : ek - ts ] ) , the harvested energy at all users is maximized when @xmath32 , while @xmath33 for @xmath34 , i.e. , all users harvest energy during the entire transmission time .",
    "therefore , problem ( p - ts ) is feasible if and only if the following linear programming ( lp ) is feasible . @xmath35",
    "it is easy to check the feasibility for the above lp .",
    "we thus assume problem ( p - ts ) is feasible subsequently .",
    "problem ( p - ts ) is non - convex in its current form .",
    "we will solve this problem in section [ sec : solution - ts ] .",
    "next , we consider the case of ofdma - based information transmission with ps applied at each receiver . as is standard in ofdma transmissions , each sc is allocated to at most one user in each slot , i.e. , no sc sharing is allowed .",
    "we define a sc allocation function @xmath36 , i.e. , the sc @xmath3 is allocated to user @xmath37 .",
    "the total transmission power constraint is given by @xmath38 at the receiver , the received signal at user @xmath9 is processed by a power splitter , where a ratio @xmath39 of power is split to its energy receiver and the remaining ratio @xmath40 is split to its information receiver , with @xmath41 .",

    "@xmath49    from ( [ eq : ek - ps ] ) , the harvested energy at all users is maximized when @xmath50 , i.e. , all power is split to the energy receiver at each user . therefore , problem ( p - ps ) is feasible if and only if problem ( p - ps ) with @xmath50 is feasible .",

    "we will solve this problem in section [ sec : solution - ps ] .",
    "an upper bound for the optimization problems ( p - ts ) and ( p - ps ) can be obtained by assuming that each receiver is able to decode the information in its received signal and at the same time harvest the received energy without any implementation loss @xcite .",
    "we thus consider the following optimization problem .",
    "@xmath51    note that problem ( p - ub ) , as well as problem ( p - ts ) and problem ( p - ps ) are subject to the same feasibility conditions as given by problem ( [ prob : feasibility ] ) .",
    "also note that any infeasible problem ( p - ub ) can be modified to become a feasible one by increasing the transmission power @xmath5 or by decreasing the minimum required harvested energy @xmath52 at some users @xmath9 . in the sequel",
    ", we assume that all the three problems are feasible , thus optimal solutions exist .",
    "the solution for problem ( p - ub ) is obtained in section [ sec : solution - ps ] ( see remark [ remark : p - ub ] ) .",

    "we shall see that the peak power constraint plays an important role in the performance comparison between the ts and ps schemes .",
    "note that @xmath63 implies the case of no peak power constraint on each sc ; and @xmath64 implies the case of only peak power constraint on each sc , since the total power constraint is always satisfied and thus becomes redundant .",
