    "in making further progress in strengthening the connection between the string theory based holographic techniques and experimentally accessible strongly coupled systems such as the quark  gluon plasma studied in heavy ion collisions at facilities such as rhic and lhc ( for reviews see _ e.g. , _ refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , better understanding is needed of systems well away from the conformal @xmath5 theory . while it is remarkable that finite temperature @xmath5 theory ( at large @xmath1 , for @xmath2 gauge group ) already has several properties in common with the quark gluon plasma ( _ e.g. , _ the strikingly small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio for its hydrodynamic behaviour@xcite ) , the introduction of temperature , while indeed breaking conformal symmetry and supersymmetry , introduces only one scale into the problem , in terms of which all other thermal properties are determined .",
    "this is evident in the dual geometry , which is ads@xmath6schwarzschild ( times @xmath7 ) @xcite , with an horizon at a radius that sets the temperature .",
    "that system ( and its dual geometry  in local ads coordinates ) has no deconfining phase transition at some non ",
    "zero @xmath8 , and is in its `` high '' temperature phase for any @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , the microscopic theory of nuclear matter , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , dynamically generates a natural scale , @xmath4 , as a result of asymptotic freedom .",
    "@xmath10 , ultimately helps determine the basic size of the bound states of quarks and gluons in the theory , setting a finite transition temperature for deconfinement to the quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase .",
    "this extends to mesons in the theory , even after the qgp has formed .",
    "the properties of the spectrum of `` quarkonium '' , as a function of quark mass , and the subsequent melting of the mesons at temperatures @xmath11 , is a subject of considerable interest , both experimentally and theoretically , not the least because quarkonium suppression could be a valuable diagnostic probe in qgp studies , were it sufficiently computationally understood .    while there are many active discussions of the extraction of @xmath12 in the literature ( see _ e.g. , _",
    "ref.@xcite s review section and references therein ) the analogous quantity in ( so  called `` top  down '' ) holographic duals is easy to extract ( at large  @xmath1 , and in a quenched limit where the quarks do not back ",

    ", meson melting is a first order phase transition @xcite from d7brane probe@xcite fluctuations with boundary conditions leading to infinitely long  lived bound states ( the mesons ) to fluctuations of d7branes that end on a black hole , where there the boundary condition gives states that decay by falling into the black hole ( the `` quasinormal '' modes  the melted mesons ) .",
    "nevertheless , the placing of d7branes in the ads@xmath6schwarzschild background ( in the zero back  reaction limit ) will still result in a melting temperature that recalls too much of the conformal nature of the parent theory .",
    "the @xmath13function of the resulting @xmath14 theory at zero quark mass is again vanishing ( since it is of order @xmath15 and here @xmath16 in the probe / quenched limit ) and so @xmath12 will be determined only in terms of the quark masses , and since there is no intrinsic non  thermal scale like @xmath10 , will be lower than what would be expected experimentally .    to make progress",
    "it is highly desirable to move away from the neighbourhood of a conformal system and cleanly study meson melting in a holographic dual of a gauge theory with a natural scale present already at @xmath17 .",
    "the mesons size and binding should depend upon this scale ( in addition to the bare quark masses ) and so the gauge theory would have a @xmath18 that is higher than if it had no scale .",
    "this is the journey begun in our previous paper@xcite , and continued in the present one .",
    "the gauge theory in question is @xmath0 , obtained by making massive an @xmath14 hypermultiplet within the @xmath5 vector multiplet , and then flowing ( already starting at strong coupling ) to the infra  red ( ir ) to study the low energy physics .",
    "now , there is no finite @xmath10 in the ir for this theory , and instead the natural scale is set by the hypermultiplet mass @xmath3 , appearing in the dual geometry as a structure that is an example of the enhanon mechanism@xcite , a beautiful combination of large  @xmath1 , quantum effects , and strong coupling .",
    "the natural coupling , @xmath19 , already starts out large for this theory ( in order to be accessible as a smooth gravity dual at least asymptotically ) and so dimensional transmutation generates no natural scale @xmath4 in the ir .",
    "this is the scale that normally generates ( through quantum effects ) the separation between monopole / dyon points on the coulomb branch _  la _ seiberg  witten@xcite . at large @xmath1 , there generically would be @xmath1 such points and since @xmath10 is vanishing here they are densely packed together , spreading out to form a circle , or in the natural coordinates , a line segment ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the radius of the circle ( or length of the line ) is set by @xmath3 , so the hypermultiplet mass @xmath3 plays the role of @xmath4 for us in the @xmath0 theory , where the dual geometry is seen to be describing part of the coulomb branch of the theory . in the dual geometry",

    "warner geometry@xcite ) , the coulomb branch is the place where the potential of a probe d3brane vanishes , and the enhanon is the large @xmath1 locus where their tension drops to zero@xcite .",
    "more generally , in the natural supergravity coordinates , the hypermultiplet mass @xmath3 sets a radius in the core of the ten  dimensional geometry where the metric becomes singular as one of the fields , @xmath20 , which in the ultra  violet ( uv ) sets the mass of the hypermultiplet , diverges .    in our previous paper@xcite",

    ", we compare the expansion of @xmath121 near the ads background for the zero temperature background ( which is in terms of @xmath120 ) with that of the finite temperature background ( which is in terms of @xmath80 ) , since near the ads boundary , the asymptotic behavior of both backgrounds should be the same .",
    "using these two expansions and setting them equal , we can solve ( iteratively ) for @xmath122 , @xmath123 plugging the expression for @xmath122 into the asymptotic equation of @xmath118 , we get : @xmath124 if we make the identification : @xmath125 and use the expression for the bare quark mass and the condensate @xcite : @xmath126 we find that the bare quark mass and condensate are given by : @xmath127 where we have used that @xmath128 .",
    "we show the results for our condensate in figure [ fig : raw_result ] .",
    "we find that there is a divergence for large quark mass , a situation that we have encountered in the zero temperature case  @xcite .",
    "in the zero temperature case , the divergence can be attributed to the numerical artifacts arising from solving for @xmath129 on top of a numerical solution for @xmath20 .",
    "we can perform a similar subtraction as in the zero temperature case to get the result in figure [ fig : t=0_subtraction_result ] .",
    "we see that there is still a divergence that is unaccounted for .",
    "this is unsurprising since for finite temperature , we have more numerics in the background ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) . in particular , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath132 is what gives the coefficient of both the linear term and linear  log term in equation ( [ eqt : c ] ) .",
    "therefore , we should expect that numerical artifacts would appear as exactly linear and linear  log terms .",

    "we now wish to study the effect of the hypermultiplet mass on the melting temperature of the mesons , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the meson is associated with 77 strings and its mass can be determined by considering fluctuations of the d7brane embedding @xcite .",
    "recall that the minkowski embeddings are related to the phase where we have mesons ( quark bound states ) in our gluon plasma , whereas the black hole embeddings are related to the phase where the mesons have melted in the plasma ( the finite lifetime quasinormal modes arising from in  falling boundary conditions at the horizon ) .",
    "we may predict what might happen based on revisiting the zero temperature result .",
    "we revisit our results from ref .",
    "@xcite , but present them in a different fashion in figure [ fig : meson_t=0 ] .",
    "recall that the meson mass should in general be given by : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the constituent quark mass and @xmath135 is the ( positive ) binding energy .",
    "the constituent mass is calculated from the nambu ",
    "goto action per unit time for the string that hangs ( in the @xmath80 direction ) from the `` end '' of the d7brane at @xmath136 to the event horizon at @xmath137 : @xmath138 in these scenarios , the meson mass is a factor of @xmath139 relative to the constituent mass , so the meson is said to be deeply bound  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we can not directly extract the binding energy for the meson at a given constituent mass , however we can make relative comparisons between the constituent mass in @xmath0 versus the constituent mass in the @xmath5 for fixed meson mass .",
    "our result in figure [ fig : meson_t=0 ] suggests that the same mass meson in @xmath0 has a higher constituent mass than the meson in @xmath5 .",
    "this in turn suggests that the ( positive ) binding energy in @xmath0 is larger . therefore .",
    "we would predict that in the thermal case , we should expect a raising in the melting temperature .    to proceed",
    ", we can study the meson mass associated with different minkowski embeddings as follows .",
    "we consider fluctuations of the field @xmath118 such that : @xmath140 where @xmath141 corresponds to the embedding solution .",
    "we can expand the dirac  born  infeld ( dbi ) action given previously ( see equation ( [ eqt : action ] ) ) to quadratic order in @xmath142 and derive the equations of motion for @xmath142 from the resulting lagrangian .",
    "we take as an ansatz for the time dependence of @xmath142 : @xmath143 such that the meson mass ( associated to this fluctuation of the d7brane ) is given by : @xmath144 note that the factor of 2 is because of the factor of 1/4 associated with @xmath145 in the uv .",
    "the allowed values for @xmath146 are computed by requiring that @xmath147 , which has expansion in the uv given by : @xmath148 only has normalizable modes , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath149 . we present some solutions for the meson mass in figures  [ fig : meson_spectrum ] .",
    "several important features include the crossing over of the meson mass ratio @xmath150 below that of thermal @xmath5 as we approach @xmath151 in figure [ fig : meson_spectrum_mq ] .",
    "this was already observed in the zero temperature results in figure  [ fig : meson_t=0_mq ] .",
    "the meson melting transition occurs near where the meson mass is zero ( the far right of figures  [ fig : meson_spectrum ] ) , but not exactly . to find the exact location ( in terms of the quark mass )",
    ", we need to calculate the free energy of the system and find where the jump ( determined by minimizing the free energy ) between the black hole and minkowski embeddings occurs , inside the region of multivaluedness of the condensate _ vs. _ mass curves of figure  [ fig : c_vs_m_physical ] .",
    "we have enlarged an example of such a region in figure  [ fig : zoom ] .",
    "( see _ e.g. , _ ref .",
    "@xcite for examples of this extraction of the temperature . )",
    "we do not have numerical control of the free energy .",
    "however , where the meson mass drops to zero ( corresponding to the end of the minkowski embeddings ) provides a good estimate of the melting temperature especially in terms of the bare quark mass .",
    "this is because the crossover region between the black hole and minkowski embeddings is a very small part of the overall curve ( this becomes even more accurate as @xmath3 increases ) . in terms of the constituent mass , we believe that the general behavior is correct although we should not take the exact numerical values here too seriously since the constituent mass rises very rapidly near the zero mass meson . with this in mind , we can systematically find an estimate of the melting temperature , and we present our results in figure [ fig : t_melt ] . as predicted by the @xmath152 results , the melting temperature increases as we increase @xmath3 .",
    "notice that the melting temperature saturates for very large @xmath3 , a fact that we discuss further in the conclusions .",
    "in a very clean setting , we have been able to demostrate how the move to a non  conformal system changes the quark and meson dynamics in an important way .",
    "the instrinsic scale , @xmath3 , of the @xmath0 theory affects the temperature at which mesons of a given mass melt ( an important phenomenon in _",
    "e.g. , _ the experimentally accessible quark ",
    "gluon plasmas studied at rhic and lhc ) .",
    "this is because the quark bound states have their properties determined by not just the scale set by the bare quark mass , but also by @xmath3 .",
    "there is a strong analogy to qcd , with its dynamically generated scale @xmath4 , and indeed this was in part the motivation for our study .    of course , the @xmath0 theory is still quite different from qcd , and so we should expect differences in the meson dynamics .",
    "for example , the scale of @xmath0 is the mass of a field in the theory , while in qcd the scale is generated by dimensional transmutation .",
    "indeed , we see from figure  [ fig : t_melt_mc ] that , for fixed constituent quark mass , @xmath18 eventually saturates for high @xmath3 , a non  trivial dependence that one would not expect in qcd .",
    "we expect that this is due to the fact the the binding energy and constituent quark mass get their contributions from the massive hypermultiplet in different ways .",
    "the contribution to binding energy evidently becomes more suppressed at higher  @xmath3 .",
    "if this were a weakly coupled scenario , an examination of the structure of the feynman diagrams contributing to each quantity at a given order ( keeping only planar diagrams , since we are at large @xmath1 ) might make this more manifest , but it is not clear if the physics of interest is at all visible in perturbation theory , since we are dealing with bound states",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate this further .",
    "another key difference is that while we did have a scale , we were not working in a confining theory .",
    "the geometry tells us about the coulomb branch of the @xmath0 theory . to get access to quark and meson dynamics ( including meson melting ) in a confining theory , a study of how to holographically lift the @xmath0 theory s coulomb branch and",
    "trigger monopole condensation would be one of a number of interesting directions to pursue .",
