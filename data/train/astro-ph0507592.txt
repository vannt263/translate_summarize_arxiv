    "it has long been known that galaxies in the dense cluster environments systematically differ from those in the field in their morphology , stellar populations , gas fractions and gas distributions .",
    "more interestingly , observations of galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift show that these properties change with redshift .",
    "this could indicate that the dense cluster environment speeds up the evolution of galaxies .",
    "various mechanisms affecting the evolution of galaxies have been suggested such as ram - pressure stripping , merging , tidal interaction , harassment or starvation . in spite of the abundance of statistical studies on clusters at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) there is a lack of indepth studies of individual galaxies which will further constrain the environmental effects in clusters . our goal is to do a detailed study of galaxies that are currently being affected by the cluster environment .",
    "virgo is ideal for this purpose .",
    "its nearness allows us to study details , and as a dynamically young cluster it shows a variety of processes at work to affect the galaxies .",
    "different mechanisms can be traced by hi observations . since the first virgo survey in early 1980s",
    "the sensitivity of the vla ( very large array ) has been significantly improved by almost a factor of 10 with a comparable resolution . as several virgo galaxies observed with a higher sensitisity show ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the newer hi data will provide much more detailed ( and possibly never seen ) structures .",
    "we selected 41 spirals ( s0/a@xmath0sm ) in the virgo cluster ( figure 1 ) .",
    "these galaxies cover a factor of 50 in mass of the cluster and span a wide range in star formation properties @xcite .",
    "they are located throughout the cluster , from the dense region close to the center to the low density outer parts .",
    "compared to previous surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with brightness cutoff of @xmath1 in @xmath2 , our sample also contains fainter systems of @xmath3 mag which are more likely to be affected by stripping or gravitational interactions due to their low masses .",
    "the observations of the 13 galaxies were made between february and may 2004 in vla c - short array .",
    "we integrated @xmath48 hours on each source with a total bandwidth of 3.25  mhz and a channel separation of 24.4  khz ( 5.2 km s@xmath5 at 21  cm ) .",
    "online hanning smoothing has been applied and the resulting velocity resolution is 10.4 km s@xmath5 .",
    "we typically reached @xmath60.3  mjy per beam ( typically @xmath7 ) per channel ( 10.4 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a 3@xmath8 surface density sensitivity of 4@xmath910@xmath10  @xmath11 . in some cases ( e.g. ngc  4294 , ngc  4299 , ngc  4383 and ngc  4694 )",
    "the cubes were spatially convolved in order to bring out faint structures .",
    "in figure 2 we present the total hi maps of 13 galaxies .",
    "ngc  4351 , ngc  4396 , and ngc  4189 decline more sharply in hi surface brightness on the side toward the cluster center .",
    "these galaxies are at intermediate distances from m87 ( 1.7@xmath04.3 deg ) and are likely to be experiencing on - going icm - ism pressure .",
    "extended tails are seen in a number of galaxies .",
    "ngc  4294/9 , ngc  4351 , ngc  4396 , ngc  4424 , ngc4651 , and ngc4698 are found at a range of distances ( @xmath12 deg from m87 ) .",
    "no obvious companions are found around these galaxies and none of their tails except possibly ngc  4424 and ngc 4651 seems to be related to tidal interactions .",
    "especially we note that ngc 4294 and ngc 4299 which are only 0.1 deg apart from each other and at similar redshifts , show tails in the same direction , unlike what happens in tidal interactions .",
    "even though we do not have a coherent three dimensional picture of virgo , it is worth mentioning that all the tails except for one case ( ngc  4651 ) are pointing away from the cluster center .",
    "the southern extension in hi of ngc  4424 could be related to the giant elliptical ngc  4472 which is located 1.56 deg away to south , either through a tidal interaction or an icm - ism interaction @xcite .",
    "ngc 4651 is a peculiar case in a sense that its optical tail and the gas tail are extended in opposite directions , to east for the stellar extension and to west for the gas tail , suggesting a minor merger .",
    "gas accretion or tidal interaction is also found in some galaxies such as ngc  4383 ( a small gas blob in se ) and ngc  4694 ( tidally interacting with a low surface brightness system vcc  2062 ) .",
    "there are several galaxies with truncated hi disks such as ngc  4064 , ngc 4424 , ngc  4569 , and ngc  4580 .",
    "ngc  4424 and ngc  4569 are located in high density regions in a sub - cluster or in the center of the cluster ( ngc  4569 is discussed further in the following section ) and icm - ism pressure likely has caused the truncation in the gas .",
    "however ngc  4064 and ngc  4580 are exceptional in a sense that both of them are located in low density environments with projected distances of 8.8 and 7.2 degrees from m87 ( 3.1 and 2.5 virial radii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively .",
    "the most likely explanation is that they have gone through the center and are on their way out .",
    "even if galaxies have not gone through the the highest density regions , icm - ism interactions could still happen at further distances from the cluster center when the galaxy interacts with locally enhanced icm due to sub cluster - cluster merging as suggested by @xcite for ngc 4522 .",
    "deep optical and h@xmath13 images have already been taken .",
    "more recently we have been granted galex ( galaxy evolution explorer ) time for the entire sample of 41 galaxies .",
    "the uv data will allow us to trace the timescales on processes at work .",
    "combined by multiwavelength data and also compared with simulations eventually we will get more clear understandings of galaxy evolutions in the cluster environments .",
    "ngc  4569 is one of the closest galaxies to the cluster center in our sample and it is severely deficient in hi ( @xmath14% of the normal hi for its size and type ) .",
    "both the h@xmath13 and hi are truncated , and only extend to 30% of its stellar disk . an anomalous arm is seen to the west both in hi and h@xmath13 ( figure 3 ) and the hi arm seems to be interrupted at the location of the h@xmath13 starburst outflow nebulosity .",
    "the hi arm extends for 3 arcmin(@xmath413 kpc ) while the h@xmath13 nebulosity near the minor axis on the nw side extends up to 6 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "some h@xmath13 filaments are also observed on the se side , but only within @xmath15 of the nucleus , and there is no large - scale h@xmath13 nebulosity in the se like that in the nw .",
    "these diffuse structures seen along the minor axis must be a product of a nuclear starburst and have been disrupted by icm pressure ( nebulosity as the superbubble ) .",
    "the icm pressure must be stronger on the se to see that the nebulosity is weaker on this side and the more extended hi structure on the other side seems to be consistent with this picture .",
    "this arm thus must be extra - planar , because it appears to be interacting with the minor axis starburst outflow , and because it lacks significant dust extinction , suggesting that it lies behind the disk .",
    "the arm resembles the features that are seen in some phases of icm - ism interaction simulations @xcite it has been suggested that the stripped gas can form one extra - planar arm by the combination of wind pressure and galaxy rotation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "ngc  4396 also show signatures of extra - planar gas .",
    "the kinematics of this gas are especially interesting ( figure 4 ) .",
    "note how the velocities in the component north of the disk are all redshifted w.r.t .",
    "nearby disk on both sides of minor axis suggesting non - circular motions , possibly indication of the presence of extra - planar gas .",
    "simulations , estimating icm pressure in this region or studying stellar population will be helpful for sorting out the interaction parameters and history .",
    "some other cases of extra - planar gas in virgo cluster galaxies have been studied in highly inclined systems .",
    "there are several pieces of evidence that ngc 4522 is experiencing ongoing icm - ism stripping despite its location far ( but similar to the distance of ngc 4396 ) from the cluster center @xcite .",
