    "nonlinear waves in complex media have been intensively studied during the last decades ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are several prototypical equations that are widely used for the description of nonlinear waves such as the burgers equation , the korteweg  de vries equation and the burgers ",
    "korteweg  de vries equation ( see , e.g. @xcite are references therein ) .",
    "usually , these universal equations are derived with the help of some asymptotic approach , for instance with the help of the reductive perturbation method ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . taking into account first ",
    "order terms in the asymptotic expansion one can obtain famous nonlinear evolution equations like the kortweg  de vries equation and the burgers  korteweg  de vries equation .",
    "however , if we consider high order corrections in the asymptotic expansion we can obtain generalizations of the above mentioned equations .",
    "one can consider these equations as universal equations with high order corrections .",
    "recently , the burgers  korteweg ",
    "de vries equation with high order corrections has been obtained for the description of nonlinear waves in a liquid with gas bubbles @xcite .",
    "this equation can be also used for the description of long nonlinear waves on a surface of a fluid layer flowing down an inclined plane @xcite . the perturbed burgers  kortwege ",
    "de vries equation has the form @xcite : @xmath0=0.\\hfill \\label{eq : extended_bkdv_equation_1 }   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is the non  dimensional gas  liquid density perturbation , @xmath2 is the non  dimensional time , @xmath3 is the non  dimensional cartesian coordinate , @xmath4 are arbitrary parameters introduced by the near  identity transformations ( see @xcite ) , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are physical parameters , @xmath12 is a small parameter .",
    "one can see that if @xmath13 goes to zero , eq .",
    "transforms to the burgers  korteweg  de vries equation .",
    "therefore , we will refer to eq . as a perturbed burgers  korteweg ",
    "de vries equation .",
    "let us briefly discuss some aspects of the derivation of the perturbed burgers  korteweg  de vries equation .",
    "as for application to waves in a liquid with gas bubbles , at the derivation of eq .",
    "both high order corrections in the asymptotic expansion and a liquid viscosity , a surface tension , an interphase heat transfer and a weak liquid compressibility have been taken into account @xcite . in the case of a liquid falling down an inclined plane a liquid viscosity and a surface tension have been taken into account along with high order corrections in the asymptotic expansion @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that the burgers  korteweg  de vries equation with high order corrections can describe nonlinear waves both in dissipative systems and in systems with dissipation and instability",
    ". parameters of eq . will be discussed below after introducing a canonical form of eq . .",
    "note that some particular cases of eq . have been studied .",
    "for instance , neglecting dissipative effects ( i.e. setting @xmath14 ) we obtain the generalized korteweg ",
    "de vries equation @xcite which is used in studying of long waves on shallow water .",
    "there are also some other particular cases of eq . such as the kawahara equation @xcite and the equation for waves in a viscoelastic tube @xcite .",
    "let us also remark that several solitary wave solutions of eq .",
    "have been found in @xcite .",
    "however , the general case of the perturbed burgers  korteweg  de vries equation has not been investigated thoroughly previously . therefore , the general case of eq . is worth studying .",
    "the aim of this work is to study eq . without imposing conditions on its parameters . to this end",
    "we use the painlev approach and the symmetry approach . by means of the painlev approach",
    "we show that eq .",
    "is not integrable in the general case .",
    "however , applying a truncated painlev expansion we find several classes of solitary waves solutions of eq . .",
    "we consider both classical and nonclassical symmetries of the perturbed burgers  korteweg  de vries equation .",
    "we construct corresponding symmetry reductions and their exact solutions .",
    "we find that eq",
    ". admits interesting periodic structures which have not been reported previously .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we transform eq . into a canonical form and study it using the painlev approach .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the symmetry analysis of the perturbed burgers  korteweg ",
    "de vries equation .",
    "both classical and nonclassical symmetries of this equation are studied . in section 4",
    "we construct symmetry reductions of the perturbed burgers  korteweg ",
    "de vries equation and their exact solutions . in the last section",
    "we briefly discuss our results .",
    "in this section we transform eq . to a canonical form and investigate it using the painleve test for partial differential equations .    in order to construct a canonical form of eq .",
    "we use the following scaling and shifts transformations : @xmath15 applying with the following parameters @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a solution of the equation @xmath18 from eq .",
    "we obtain the equation ( primes are omitted ) : @xmath19 the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given by @xmath22 below , we study eq . .",
    "let us discuss parameters of eq . .",
    "as far as application of eq . to waves in a liquid with gas bubbles",
    "is concerned , parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be considered as parameters defining dissipation of nonlinear waves governed by eq . .",
    "this dissipation is caused by the inter  phase heat transfer ( parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , liquid viscosity ( parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) and weak liquid compressibility ( the parameter @xmath25 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 define dispersion of nonlinear waves which is caused by the presence of bubbles and by the interphase heat transfer .",
    "there are both dissipation and instability terms in eq . in the case of long waves on a surface of a liquid flowing down an inclined plane .",
    "parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 define instability caused by gravity and the parameter @xmath25 defines dissipation caused by the surface tension . therefore ,",
    "when application of eq .",
    "to flow of a liquid flowing down an inclined plane is concerned , parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are negative and the parameter @xmath25 is positive .",
    "let us investigate eq . using the painlev approach for partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "we look for a solution of eq . in the from @xcite @xmath26 the necessary condition for eq . to possess",
    "the painlev property is that expansion contains five arbitrary functions .    substituting into the leading terms of eq .",
    "we find that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "thus , eq . admits two expansions into series . substituting the expression @xmath30 into the leading terms of eq .",
    "we find the fuchs indices : @xmath31 therefore , functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the first expansion have to be arbitrary to eq .",
    "passes the painlev test .",
    "however , substituting into eq .",
    "we obtain that series exists only when @xmath34 .",
    "we also find that functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are not arbitrary .",
    "thus , we see that eq .",
    "does not pass the painlev test . in the case of second expansion",
    "there are no additional conditions for series to exist .",
    "however , we find that functions @xmath37 and @xmath33 are not arbitrary .",
    "on the other hand , expansion may be useful for construction of exact solutions of eq . .",
    "we use the following truncation of expansion @xcite : @xmath38 substituting into eq .",
    "we obtain an overdetermined system of equations for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath35 . in order to find solutions of this system of equations we use the ansatz @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an arbitrary constant @xcite . in this way we can find several families of exact solutions of eq . .",
    "for instance , the following typical solitary wave solutions corresponding to both of expansions can be constructed : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 values of parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 and corresponding constraints on parameters of eq .",
    "are given in table [ t : tab1a ] .",
    "we present plots of solitary waves solutions described by formulas  in fig.[f : f1 ] .    using values of parameters presented in table [ t : tab1a ]",
    "one can see that there are no constraints on parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for solution to exist .",
    "thus , a kink  type wave given by may describe nonlinear waves both in the case of a liquid with gas bubbles and in the case of a fluid flowing down an inclined plane .",
    "a balance between nonlinearity , dispersion and dissipation or between nonlinearity , dispersion , dissipation and instability allows the existence of this structure in both of these cases correspondingly .",
    "solution exists only at @xmath49 , and , therefore , may describe kink  type structures in dissipative media such as a liquid with gas bubbles .",
    "solitary wave solutions given by and may appear only in media with dissipation and instability since parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are negative .",
    "therefore , only a balance between nonlinearity , dispersion , dissipation and instability leads to existence of solitary wave solutions .",
    "in this section we study symmetries admitted by eq . .",
    "to this end we use the classical lie method ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and the nonclassical method by bluman and cole @xcite .",
    "let us apply the classical lie method to eq . .",
    "it is known that eq . is invariant under action of the infinitesimal transformations @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the group parameter , if the determining equations are satisfied on the solutions of eq . @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the prolonged infinitesimal generator @xcite .    substituting the expression for @xmath55 we obtain an overdetermined system of linear partial differential equations for infinitesimals",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "solving this system of equations we find that eq .",
    "admits three one - parametric lie groups with the following infinitesimal generators : @xmath59 in the case of @xmath60 we find additional infinitesimal generators : @xmath61 infinitesimal generators @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 correspond to shifts in @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath65 correspondingly , while infinitesimal generators @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 correspond to invariance of eq . under scaling transformations . therefore , eq . , and consequently eq .",
    ", admits only the traveling wave reduction in the general case .",
    "the case of @xmath60 corresponds to the self ",
    "similar reduction of the generalized kortweg ",
    "de vries equation .",
    "it is known that partial differential equations may admit symmetries which can not be found with the classical lie approach @xcite .",
    "such symmetries are called nonclassical symmetries .",
    "below , we investigate these symmetries using the method by bluman and cole @xcite .    according to this method we consider the additional auxiliary equation @xmath69 eq . is the invariant surface condition associated with the vector field @xmath70 .",
