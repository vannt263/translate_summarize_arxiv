    "there has been much recent interest in the investigation of the conditions for the existence of chimera states ( or chimeras ) in networks of interacting identical oscillators .",
    "a chimera state occurs , in general , when the symmetry of the system of oscillators is broken into coexisting synchronized and desynchronized subsets .",
    "such states were first recognized in systems of nonlocally coupled phase oscillators @xcite and have since been the subject of many investigations in a diversity of models , including coupled map lattices @xcite , chaotic flows @xcite , neural systems @xcite , population dynamics @xcite , van der pol oscillators @xcite , boolean networks @xcite , lasers @xcite , and quantum systems @xcite .",
    "chimera states have been also observed experimentally in coupled populations of chemical oscillators @xcite , optical light modulators @xcite , coupled lasers @xcite , mechanical @xcite , electrochemical @xcite , and electronic @xcite oscillator systems .",
    "furthermore , chimeras can occur in systems with local ( nearest - neighbors ) interactions @xcite or global ( all - to - all ) interactions @xcite .",
    "in fact , kaneko observed a chimera behavior in a globally coupled map network early in 1990 @xcite , consisting of the coexistence of one synchronized cluster and a cloud of desynchronized elements .",
    "this behavior has been recently identified as a chimera state @xcite .",
    "applications of chimera states may arise in real - world phenomena such as the unihemispheric sleep in birds and dolphins @xcite , neuronal bump states @xcite , epileptic seizure @xcite , power grids @xcite , or social systems @xcite",
    ". reviews of this growing field of research have lately appeared @xcite .",
    "although no universal mechanism for their emergence has yet been established , chimera states appear in many spatiotemporal dynamical systems under a broad range of conditions , including a variety of network topologies and local dynamics .",
    "however , it has been recently argued that chimera states can not be obtained in networks of oscillators possessing hyperbolic chaotic attractors @xcite .",
    "this type of chaotic attractors exhibits a homogeneous structure over a finite range of parameters . in this paper",
    ", we revisit this hypothesis .",
    "we consider a network of globally coupled lozi maps as a prototype of a system possessing hyperbolic chaotic attractors , and find that chimera states can actually take place for some values of parameters .",
    "these states appear related to the phenomenon of dynamical clustering typical of systems with global interactions . to characterize the collective behavior on the space of parameters of the system ,",
    "we employ two statistical quantities that allow to distinguish between chimera states , clusters , incoherence , and complete synchronization .",
    "in addition , we show that chimera states can arise for a sufficiently long range of interaction in nonlocally coupled networks of lozi maps .",
    "hyperbolic chaotic attractors possess the property of robust chaos : i.e. there exist a neighborhood in the space of parameters of the system where periodic windows are absent and the chaotic attractor is unique .",
    "it has been found that several dynamical systems can display robust chaos ; for a review see ref .",
    "robustness is an important feature in applications that require reliable operation in a chaotic regime , in the sense that the chaotic behavior can not be destroyed by arbitrarily small perturbations of the system parameters .",
    "for instance , networks of coupled maps with robust chaos have been efficiently employed in communication schemes @xcite .    as an example of a hyperbolic chaotic system , we consider the lozi map @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are real parameters . figure",
