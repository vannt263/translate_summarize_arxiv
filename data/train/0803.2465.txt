    "secondly , there is still a possibility to find a bound state existing purely due to tunnelling , i.e. , without external potential , as was shown in eq .",
    "( [ expsol ] ) , and a second bound state may arise with different energy due to coulumb repulsion between electrons with different spins",
    ". however , this is most probably not the case we have in the experiments , because due to electron - hole symmetry such states would exist also above the fermi energy , a result which is not observed experimentally .",
    "we presented several possibilities to explain the observed localized states at the crossing of metallic and semiconducting nanotubes.@xcite all of them require the existence of an external potential in the metallic and/or semiconducting swnt to break the electron - hole symmetry , since the localized states were seen only below the fermi energy .",
    "most probably , such a potential comes from a schottky barrier and the effect of lattice distortions is minimal , since such localized states were , up to now , observed only for ms crossings and not for mm or ss ones .",
    "moreover , the effective mass of quasiparticle excitations should be of order @xmath213 , where @xmath242 is the actual electron mass , to generate only a few bound states localized on a region of approximately @xmath220 nm with energy of order of @xmath243 ev .",
    "the best agreement with the experimental data is obtained by assuming that the second bound state has a different energy due to the coulumb repulsion between electrons with different spins .",
    "the role of tunnelling in the observed electronic structure is not clear and allows for many interpretations . to avoid such ambiguity ,",
    "the electronic structure of the semiconducting nanotube should be measured as well . moreover , to be sure that the available sts measurements indeed represent the electronic structure of the nanotube and are free of artifacts introduced by the stm tip @xcite several measurements with different tip height should be performed .",
    "we are very grateful to s.  g.  lemay for useful discussions .      here",
    "we consider the green s function as a function of one variable @xmath125 and fix @xmath157 for a moment .",
    "since @xmath138 is the green s function , we require it to satisfy proper boundary conditions @xmath244 , be continuous @xmath245 , and also @xmath246 . substituting eq .",
    "( [ fsrepf ] ) into the above requirements one finds @xmath247 where @xmath248 multiplying the eq .",
    "( [ acoef ] ) by the matrix @xmath249 we find @xmath250\\\\   \\psi_{2}(-l)[\\psi_{2}(l)\\psi_{1}(x_2)-\\psi_{1}(l)\\psi_{2}(x_2)]\\\\    -\\psi_{1}(l)[\\psi_{2}(-l)\\psi_{1}(x_2)-\\psi_{1}(-l)\\psi_{2}(x_2)]\\\\   -\\psi_{1}(-l)[\\psi_{2}(l)\\psi_{1}(x_2)-\\psi_{1}(l)\\psi_{2}(x_2 ) ] \\end{array }   \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath251^{-1}.\\ ] ] the wronskian @xmath252 is nonzero for linearly independent functions and its value does not depends on the point @xmath157 .",
    "suppose that eq .",
    "( [ srdng ] ) has a solution @xmath253 which is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric .",
    "thus , for symmetric potentials @xmath254 is also a solution and both of them are linearly independent .",
    "furthermore , we can then compose a symmetric @xmath255 and an antisymmetric @xmath256 solutions .",
    "in particular , for a harmonic potential @xmath257 , one can find such a solution @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the hermite polynomial for integer @xmath260 .",
    "it follows then that @xmath261 and @xmath262 moreover , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath147 , @xmath263 the eq .",
