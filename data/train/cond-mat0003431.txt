    "in addition , sedimentation experiments at larger concentrations , including the nematic phase are performed .",
    "in order to calculate sedimentation velocities , the connection between translational and angular velocities , and hydrodynamic forces and torques must be found . in the present section",
    "such a relation will be established for two rods on the rodne - prager level , that is , with the neglect of reflection contributions between the rods .",
    "considering only two rods limits the discussion on the sedimentation velocity to first order in concentration .",
    "reflection contributions to the two - rod hydrodynamic interaction functions and multi - body rod interactions are both probably small in comparison to the rodne - prager terms , due to the fact that the distance between segments of different rods is of the order of the length of the rods , at least in the isotropic state .",
    "a rodne - prager approximation could therefore work quite well for long and thin rods , although explicit results for reflection contributions should be obtained to confirm this intuition .",

    "this is the subject of subsection  [ flowfield ] .",
    "rotation of rods also plays a role in sedimentation , but as will turn out , to first order in concentration and with the neglect of hydrodynamic reflection contributions , these do not contribute to the sedimentation velocity .",

    "the approximations involved in the off - diagonal mobility matrices in eqs.(34,38 ) are primarily due to the mean - field treatment of the incident flow field .",
    "it is probably a formidable task to improve on these expressions .",
    "the use of the more accurate expression ( 22 ) for the diagonal translational mobility matrix also circumvents the practical problem of calculating volume fractions of colloidal rod material from given values for @xmath15 , @xmath14 and number density . for the bead model",
    "it is not so clear how the volume of a rod must be expressed in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "the volume of the cylindrical rod is simply equal to @xmath96 .",
    "the sedimentation of colloidal material induces , through the presence of the walls of the container , backflow of solvent .",
    "the backflow velocity is inhomogeneous , and varies on the length scale of the container . on a local scale , however , the backflow may be considered homogeneous , and the sedimentation velocity can be calculated relative to the local backflow velocity .",
    "this _ relative _ sedimentation velocity is a constant throughout the container ( except possibly in a small region of extent @xmath15 near the walls of the container , where gradients of the backflow velocity are large ) , and depends only on the properties of the suspension .",
    "a formal evaluation of the sedimentation velocity directly from eq.(1 ) , by ensemble averaging , leads to spurious divergences , which are the result of the neglect of the hydrodynamic effects of the walls of the container which lead to solvent backflow .",
    "batchelor was the first to deal with these divergences correctly , and we will use his arguments here [ 2 ] .    ensemble averaging of @xmath97 in eq.(1 ) gives the sedimentation velocity @xmath98 , which is thus found to be equal to , @xmath99 where the brackets @xmath100 denote ensemble averaging with respect to positions and orientations of the rods .",
    "the factors @xmath101 account for the presence of @xmath102 rods which all interact with rod @xmath66 under consideration .",
    "the divergence problems mentioned above arising in the explicit evaluation of the ensemble averages will be dealt with later .    in order to be able to calculate these ensemble averages , the forces and torques",
    "must be expressed in terms of the positions and orientations of the rods . on the brownian time scale",
    "there is a balance between all the forces and torques on each of the rods , that is , the total force and torque are equal to zero . the total force in turn is equal to the sum of the force @xmath8 that the fluid exerts on the rod , the interaction force @xmath103 ( with @xmath104 the total interaction energy of the rods ) , the brownian force @xmath105 ( with @xmath106 boltzmann s constant , @xmath107 the temperature and @xmath108 the probability density function for positions and orientations ) , and the external force @xmath109 due to the gravitational field .",
    "hence , @xmath110 similarly , the total torque is the sum of the hydrodynamic torque @xmath111 , the interaction torque @xmath112 , the brownian torque @xmath113 , while the torque on each rod due to the homogeneous external force vanishes .",
    "hence , @xmath114 where the rotation operator is defined as , @xmath115 with @xmath116 the gradient operator with respect to @xmath117 .",

    "it is convenient to introduce the pair - correlation function @xmath120 , defined as , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the probability density function for the position and orientation of a single rod . for spherical particles in a homogeneous external gravitational field ,",
    "the probability density function for the position coordinates is simply the equilibrium function , without an external field , provided that the particles are identical .",
    "the probability density function differs from the equilibrium function only in case the relative sedimentation velocity of two spheres is different , for example due to differing masses and/or sizes . for rods , things are somewhat more complicated . even if two rods are identical their relative sedimentation velocity generally differs as a result of the fact that the translational friction constant of rods is orientation dependent ( see eq.(17 ) ) .",
    "the probability density function is generally dependent on the external force due to the fact that rods with different orientations overtake each other during sedimentation .",
    "suppose , however , that the sedimentation velocity is so slow , that during a relative displacement of two rods in the gravitational field of the order of the length @xmath15 of the rods , each rod rotated many times due to their brownian motion .",
    "the relative sedimentation velocity of two rods then averages out to zero .",
    "for such a case , the pair - correlation function is only weakly perturbed by the external field , so that we may use its equilibrium boltzmann form , @xmath123 let us derive the inequality that should be satisfied for eq.(29 ) to be valid . according to eq.(17 ) , the largest relative sedimentation velocity @xmath124 of two rods is approximately equal to , @xmath125 on the other hand , the time @xmath126 required for a rotational revolution is equal to , @xmath127 the condition under which eq.(29 ) for the pair - correlation function is a good approximation is therefore , @xmath128 hence , the work provided by the external force to displace a colloidal rod over a distance equal to its length should be much smaller than a few times the thermal energy of the rods .",
    "substitution of typical numbers shows that this inequality is satisfied under normal practical circumstances .",
    "furthermore , when alignment of the rods during sedimentation in a homogeneous suspension is of no importance , the one - particle probability density functions in eq.(28 ) are both constants equal to , @xmath129 we will restrict ourselves here to the most common situation where the inequality ( 32 ) is satisfied , and assume negligible alignment , so that the probability density function is well approximated by eqs.(28,29,33 ) . in that case",
    "many of the terms in eq.(27 ) for the sedimentation velocity cancel : the interaction contributions cancel against the brownian terms .",
    "the sedimentation velocity reduces simply to , @xmath130 \\cdot{{\\mathbf f}}^{ext } \\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath131 for large distances , its ensemble average with respect to position coordinates diverges .",
    "such a spurious divergence is also found for spherical particles , and is the result of the neglect of the hydrodynamic effect of the walls of the container .",
    "batchelor [ 2 ] showed that a formally divergent quantity , which is unambiguously finite valued on physical grounds , can be subtracted from the ensemble average , rendering a perfectly well defined sedimentation velocity .",
    "this finite valued quantity is formally divergent for the same reason that the ensemble average of @xmath87 is divergent , and subtraction accounts for the local hydrodynamic effects of the wall .",
    ", as for spheres .",
    "such a divergence can be dealt with by noting that the ensemble average of the deviatoric part of the stress tensor vanishes .",
    "we will not go into the extension of batchelor s arguments to rods to deal with this conditionally divergence problem . ]",
    "batchelor s argument is as follows .",
    "first define the velocity @xmath132 as the velocity at a point @xmath28 ( either in the fluid or inside a colloidal rod ) , given the positions @xmath133 and orientations @xmath134 of @xmath135 rods . in the laboratory reference frame the net flux of material through a cross sectional area must be zero .",
    "this means that the ensemble average of @xmath136 must be zero .",
    "hence , @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the probability density function for @xmath139 .",
    "formally , this ensemble average diverges for the same reason that the sedimentation velocity diverges : the flow field @xmath136 varies like @xmath140 for large distances due to its oseen contribution . the formally divergent expression ( 35 )",
    ", that must be zero for physical reasons , is subtracted from eq.(34 ) for the sedimentation velocity to render this expression convergent .",
    "the field @xmath136 can generally be written as the sum of a two terms : a term to which the field would be equal to in the absence of reflection contributions plus a term that accounts for the reflection contributions . to within our approach reflection contributions",
    "are neglected so that only the former term survives here .",

    "on the other hand , the sedimentation velocity of the faster moving component rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath194 concentration and at the same time the difference between the plateau concentrations of the two components increases with increasing average concentration .",
    "the unstable sedimentation of colloidal rods in the nematic phase has a similar origin as the self - sharpening effect described in appendix c. the reason for the instability is the discontinous jump in sedimentation velocity that occurs at the isotropic - nematic phase transition as is shown in fig .",

    "below this boundary ( to the right ) the rods are still in the nematic phase while above it the concentration of rods is very low and therefore they are in the isotropic state .",
    "this occurs because some particles will inevitably diffuse against the centrifugal field from a highly concentrated plateau into the dilute region .",
    "as this happens they simultaneously undergo a transition from the nematic to the isotropic phase .",
    "since the sedimentation velocity of rods in the isotropic phase is much lower then in nematic phase , the probability of the rods diffusing from the isotropic phase back into the nematic phase is virtually zero .",
    "it is this asymmetry that results in a continuous flux of particles from the nematic into the isotropic phase and contributes to the formation of the second plateau in the isotropic phase that is moving at a slower speed .",
    "the concentration of the rods in the isotropic plateau will be very close to the concentration of isotropic rods co - existing with the nematic phase due to the self - sharpening effect because dilute isotropic rods will catch up with more concentrated isotropic rods .",
    "however , the highest concentration the isotropic rods can attain is the co - existence concentration between the isotropic and nematic phases , as long as the nematic phase sediments faster then the isotropic phase . indeed",
    ", this is very close to what we observe in fig .",
    "[ time_series_nematic ] .",
    "another experimental observation corroborating our explanation is that the sedimentation velocity and concentration of the slower isotropic plateau does not change significantly with average concentration of rods as seen in fig [ 10mmsvedberg ] .    since the theory presented in this paper is valid only to first order in concentration of rods , to obtain an accurate value of the prefactor @xmath2 in eq .",
