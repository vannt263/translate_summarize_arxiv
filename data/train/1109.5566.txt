    "the charmed baryon @xmath0 with mass @xmath12 mev and width @xmath13 mev was first observed in the @xmath14 invariant mass spectrum by the babar collaboration @xcite .",
    "later , @xmath0 was confirmed by the belle collaboration in the @xmath15 channels @xcite , where the obtained mass and width are @xmath16 mev and @xmath17 mev respectively .",
    "obviously the values achieved by the two collaborations are consistent with each other within the error tolerance @xcite .    actually , comparing with the meson case , the structure of baryons is more intriguing from both theoretical and experimental aspects . recently , along with the experimental progress at the babar , belle and bes , a great number of new states of mesons have been observed and some of them are identified as exotic , i.e. , these states can not be categorized into the regular @xmath18 structure .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that the possibility also exists for the baryons .",
    "however , this situation is much more complicated than the meson case . by the regular structure ,",
    "the baryon is composed of three quarks , so the exotic configuration of baryons would be much more difficult to be identified . on the other side , this study can enrich our knowledge on the fundamental structure of hadrons ; namely , it will answer the long - standing question that the @xmath19 theory indeed allows existence of the non @xmath20 and @xmath21 configurations , and , if yes , where do we search for them ? that is the job of theorists of high energy physics .    experimentally , some peculiar phenomena have been observed . before we can attribute them to new physics or new hadronic configuration , a thorough study of whether they can be interpreted by the regular quark structure and the standard model ( sm )",
    "must be carried out .",
    "the observation of @xmath0 has stimulated theorists extensive interest in understanding its structure .",
    "since the observed charmed baryon @xmath0 is close to the production threshold of @xmath22 , a conjecture that @xmath0 may be a @xmath23 molecular state , was naturally proposed @xcite .",
    "the masses of @xmath23 molecular states were calculated in the potential model , and the results support the statement that @xmath0 is an s - wave @xmath24 molecular state with spin parity @xmath25 or @xmath26 @xcite . recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite systematically studied the interaction between @xmath27 and the nucleon , and concluded that the @xmath23 systems may behave as @xmath28 baryon states . with the @xmath25 and @xmath26 assignments ,",
    "the strong decays of @xmath0 have been investigated by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , but their result determines that the assignment of @xmath0 as a @xmath23 molecular state with @xmath25 should be excluded .",
    "later , the radiative and strong three - body decays of @xmath0 were explored in refs .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath0 was assigned as a @xmath23 molecular state of @xmath26 .    besides supposing @xmath0 to be a molecular state , the alternative theoretical explanation that @xmath29 is just a conventional charmed baryon",
    "has also been widely discussed .",
    "the calculation in terms of the potential model shows that the masses of the conventional charmed baryons of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are 2900 mev and 2910 mev , respectively @xcite , which are close to the mass of @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors suggested that @xmath0 is the first radial excitation of @xmath32 of @xmath33 and possesses the quantum number of @xmath33 . in their calculations of the mass spectrum the relativistic quark - diquark model was used .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 as the first radial excitation of the @xmath34 was also suggested via solving the faddeev equations for three - body systems in the momentum space @xcite . in the heavy hadron",
    "chiral perturbation theory , the ratio @xmath35 was obtained if the spin - parity of @xmath29 is @xmath30 or @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "these ratios will be applied to distinguish different @xmath36 assignments of @xmath29 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors calculated the strong decays of newly observed charmed hadrons in the @xmath37 model . here , @xmath29 could only be a d - wave charmed baryon @xmath38 or @xmath39 while @xmath29 as the first radial excitation of @xmath40 is completely excluded since @xmath41 was observed by the babar collaboration @xcite .",

    "in this work we investigate the production rate of @xmath0 in the future experiments at panda .",

    ", let us briefly discuss dependence of the numerical result on the phenomenologically introduced parameter @xmath79 used in this work .",
    "the cutoff @xmath80 gev is adopted as suggested in ref .  @xcite . if the cutoff @xmath79 decreases to @xmath81 gev , both the production rate of @xmath0 and the background would increase about one order .",
    "the number of events is still large enough for investigating behaviors of @xmath0 in the proton and antiproton collision . in our numerical computations",
    "we adopt the same cutoff @xmath79 value as that in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we would like to specify an important issue , which was discussed in literature and may affect our theoretical estimate of the production rate . it is noted that the initial state interaction ( isi ) effect is included in the numerical result presented in secs . [ 2940 ] and [ background ] .",
    "the isi is an important effect for studying meson production in nucleon - nucleon collisions as the transition occurs near the threshold .",
    "that effect was first observed by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite that the isi makes the cross section to be reduced by an overall factor , which is slightly energy - dependent . in studying @xmath82 process , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also took into account the isi effect , which reduces the cross section of @xmath82 by a factor 10 .",
    "the isi may be induced by complicated interaction processes among the ingredients inside the colliding @xmath52 and @xmath83 , which may be valence quarks or even gluons and sea quarks .",
    "it is believed that such processes are governed by the non - perturbative qcd effects , thus not calculable so far .",
    "interesting to note that for high energy @xmath84 or @xmath85 collisions , one can use the parton distribution function ( pdf ) due to the asymptotic freedom of qcd , but for lower energy collisions , we do not know how to correctly deal with the isi effects .",
    "therefore , as suggested by previous research @xcite , we would retain a phenomenological factor in the numerical estimate of the production rate to take care of the isi effect on @xmath86 .",
    "thus , an extra factor is introduced to reflect the isi effect , which makes the cross section of @xmath86 corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) suppressed by one order of magnitude ( the isi effect is considered in the numerical results presented in figs .",
    "[ lclc]-[sp ] ) . with above consideration",
    ", we can roughly estimate the production events of @xmath0 at panda and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ lc2940 ] .",
    "the designed luminosity of panda is about @xmath87 @xmath6/s , so the integrated luminosity in one day run is about @xmath78 nb@xmath88 .",
    "assuming we have a 50% overall efficiency , we may expect @xmath89 events of @xmath0 per day produced at panda .",
    "in addition , we also would like to emphasize that the qualitative conclusion , which is made via the background analysis and dalitz plot , is not affected by whether including the isi effect .",
    "furthermore , the line shape of the cross section and invariant mass spectrum without taking in the background is independent of the coupling constant @xmath90 .",
    "if the branching ratio of @xmath91 is about 10% , there is a large final - state phase space for the production of @xmath54 . as @xmath89 of @xmath0 per day",
    "can be produced , one can carefully study the properties of @xmath0 via the channel of @xmath92 in the future panda experiments . in the second sub - process",
    ", @xmath56 decays into @xmath93 which is easy to be experimentally observed and the constructed invariant mass can accurately identify @xmath56 .",
    "since the belle collaboration confirmed @xmath0 in the @xmath15 channels @xcite , we also study the @xmath0 production in @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 compose the background and signal for the @xmath0 production respectively . in the former channel , because of constraint from the phase space , the @xmath56 can only be an off - shell intermediate state for the final state @xmath97 , so due to the breit - wigner structure , such sub - process is relatively suppressed in comparison with the `` signal '' . the cross section and the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath98 with @xmath99  gev and @xmath10010%",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ sp ] . here , we take the coupling constant as @xmath101 , which results in a weaker background",
    ". the signals of @xmath0 can be distinguished from the background easily as shown in fig .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the channel @xmath102 is also a suitable channel to study @xmath0 .",
    "c    based on the analysis above , it is optimistic to investigate @xmath0 in the future experiment of panda , even though the cross section is not as large as for the charminium - like states , such as @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is very interesting to notice the observation potential at belleii @xcite and the super@xmath104 factory @xcite , which will produce a large database of @xmath105 .",
    "as @xmath105 may have a sizable branching ratio to decay into @xmath106 , thus comparing the data obtained at panda with that from the @xmath104-factory would make more sense and help eventually to pin down the spin - parity assignment of @xmath0 .",
