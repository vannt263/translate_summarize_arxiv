    "about 10 per cent of white dwarfs reside in close binary systems @xcite .",
    "the formation of white - dwarf close - binary systems commences with a pair of main - sequence stars orbiting in a wide binary .",
    "the most massive star will evolve faster becoming a giant and transferring mass to its companion . if mass transfer is sufficiently rapid , the result will be the formation of a common envelope ( ce ) made of the outer layers of the giant .",
    "the orbital energy of the binary can then be used to eject the envelope , the result being a binary composed of a white dwarf and a main sequence companion .",
    "if the mass ratio of the initial components was close to unity , the binary formed after ce ejection can still be wide , whereas in the case of extreme mass ratios , the two components will spiral in to eject the envelope forming a tighter binary .",
    "this binary , called a post common envelope binary ( pceb ) , if close enough , might become a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) if mass is transferred stably from the main sequence star to the white dwarf .",
    "if , on the other hand , the binary is too wide to become a cv , the main sequence star will evolve into a giant and the system will undergo another ce phase .",
    "when the envelope is ejected , the resulting binary will be composed of two white dwarfs a few solar radii apart - called a double degenerate ( dd ) . for details on the evolution and formation of dds",
    "see nelemans et al.s recent population synthesis studies and references therein .",
    "the study of white - dwarf close - binary stars can help us understand the elusive ce phase that they must have gone through , at least once , during their evolution .",
    "this phase is very difficult to study in any other manner as it lasts only of the order of 1 to 100 years . for recent calculations on ce",
    "ejection efficiencies see soker &  harpaz and references therein .",
    "the subjects of this paper , white dwarf - m dwarf binaries and dds , are , as mentioned above , the progenitors of cvs , and potential progenitors of type ia supernova respectively .",
    "a short period dd where the combined mass of the white dwarfs exceeds the chandrasekhar mass might become a type ia supernova @xcite , but no candidates have yet been found . we should mention that this idea is still quite controversial with some theorists claiming that a dd does not become a type ia supernova @xcite and others claiming that this can be the case if one includes rotation in the calculations @xcite . the eso supernova ia progenitor survey ( spy )",
    "has as its main goal to search systematically for massive , short period dds in the galaxy to establish their direct link with type ia supernova and it is the source of more than 100 recently discovered dd systems @xcite .",
    "efforts are also been carried out to systematically find white - m dwarf binaries by using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) resulting in more than 400 possible candidates @xcite .",
    "schreiber &  gnsicke review the evolution of the known sample of white - dwarf close binaries with main sequence companions , the pcebs , and conclude that , due to selection effects , the ( until then ) known population of pcebs is dominated by young systems with hot white dwarfs that will evolve into short period cvs ( p @xmath0 3 h ) .",
    "the pceb sample is biased toward low mass companions as well which is the reason why they evolve into short period cvs .",
    "in contrast , the pcebs found in the sdss @xcite , published later on , show an average white dwarf temperature significantly lower , demonstrating that to sample the full parameter space better selection criteria have to be devised .",
    "in this paper we study 6 white dwarf close - binary stars .",
    "four of them are found to be dds , the other two are composed of a white dwarf and an m dwarf star .",
    "the separation of both components in these binaries is of the order of a few solar radii , as determined from their short orbital periods , so they are detached systems where no mass transfer between them takes place .",
    "we obtain their orbital solutions and compare the results obtained with predictions drawn from population synthesis studies .",
    "the data used in this study were taken over many years ( since 1993 ) using five different telescopes and seven different setups .",
    "table  [ obs ] gives a list of the number of spectra taken for each target at each observing campaign indicating also which telescope was used in each case .",

    "we have obtained the orbital solution for four dd systems and two white dwarf - m dwarf binaries .",
    "we find that the white dwarf companions for the four dds studied contribute between 10 and 20 per cent of the total luminosity and remain undetected .",
    "the masses and periods obtained for these systems agree with theoretical mass period distributions ( based on nelemans et al . ) .",
    "in the case of the white dwarf - m dwarf binaries we have been able to measure the motion of both components .",
    "we find that there are signatures of strong irradiation of the surface of the m dwarf component in .",
    "the white dwarf masses calculated from their gravitational redshift are unusually high compared to those measured by fitting their hydrogen lines with stellar atmosphere models , and could be the result of the evolution of giant stars with masses between 1.25 and 3.5  that went through a ce phase as a result of tidal interaction .",
    "these two binaries are young pcebs that will evolve into cvs , although not within a hubble time , with orbital periods below the period gap .",
