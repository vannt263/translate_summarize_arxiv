    "these results suggest that this galaxy actually has a seyfert  1 nucleus which is obscured from direct view but is seen in light scattered from , and hence polarized by , obscuring material which may be arranged in the form of a disk or torus surrounding the central nucleus",
    ".    inspection of the enlr spectra shows the existence of ionized gas emitting high - excitation ] @xmath6 and [ ] @xmath7 lines at an approximate distance of between 15@xmath8 and 50@xmath8 from the centre of ngc  1068 ( evans & dopita 1986 ; bergeron et al .",
    "lower ionization lines such as [ ] @xmath9 and [ ] @xmath10 have intensity ratios relative to h@xmath11 ) which are similar to those seen in regions , and do not reflect the degree of ionization which might be expected based on the detection of the [ ] @xmath6 line ( evans & dopita 1986 ) .",
    "furthermore the spectra of the enlr show a low intensity of [ ] @xmath7 and @xmath12 lines compared to the intensity of [ ] @xmath6 .",
    "evans and dopita ( 1986 ) modelled the enlr spectra in ngc  1068 with two emission components : regions and highly - ionized low density gas .",
    "they also suggested that the continuum seen by the high - excitation gas has a turn - on energy ( simulating a photo - electric cut - off due to absorption by intervening material closer to the centre ) varying over the range 20 - 60 ryd .",
    "this decreases the intensity of the @xmath13 and [ ] @xmath14 lines compared to the intensity of [ ] @xmath15 .",
    "bergeron et al . ( 1989 ) used optical emission - line ratios to infer that the ionizing continuum seen by the enlr gas may be two orders of magnitude larger than the observed soft x - ray continuum .",
    "nazarova ( 1995 ) modelled the high - excitation enlr gas in ngc  1068 with a central power - law continuum and an extended source of ionization .",
    "the extended source was assumed to be stars of temperature 80000k located 12  kpc from the centre ( or 1428 arcsec adopting 1 arcsec = 72pc ( tully 1988 ) ) .",
    "the central region of ngc  1068 does have a ring of very luminous regions 13 arcsec from the centre ( snijders et al .",
    "1982 ; bruhweiler et al .",
    "1991 ) . adding",
    "an additional stellar source changes the shape of the incident spectrum which ionises the enlr gas by adding a bump at 2.5 ryd ( corresponding to the peak emission energy of a star with temperature 80000k ) .",
    "this bump changes the population of the ionization stages .",
    "the o@xmath16 moves to the higher stages o@xmath17 and o@xmath18 and he@xmath19 to he@xmath20 .",
    "similarly ne@xmath17 moves to ne@xmath18 , although this change is small due to the higher ionization threshold .",
    "overall , adding the stellar component leads to stronger emission in [ ] @xmath15 compared to that of [ ] @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "although modelling the enlr spectra of ngc  1068 with an additional stellar ionization source helps alleviate the `` energy deficit '' problem , there still exists a problem connected with the geometry of the extended region .",
    "since there are many galaxies with enlrs which show strong emission in the high - excitation [ ] @xmath6 line ( binette et al .",
    "1996 ) , it seems unlikely that they all have a strong contribution from a ring of very luminous regions at just the right location around the nucleus .",
    "recently , binette et al . (",
    "1996 ) proposed that the high - excitation line strengths in enlrs , together with other problems such as low electronic temperatures and the small range in the /h@xmath21 ratio , could be successfully solved by assuming that the enlr contains a combination of matter - bounded and ionization - bounded clouds .",
    "these two cloud populations have different spectra and therefore can be combined to reproduce a wide range of observed enlr spectra .",
    "a principal result was that the ionization - bounded clouds are photoionized by radiation from the central - source which has been attenuated by the matter - bounded component .    in this paper",
    "we explore the advantages of such multi - component gas models in attempts to fit the observed enlr spectrum of ngc  1068 , adopting the shape of the central continuum as given by pier et al .",
    "we also examine the effect of different central luminosities and different amounts of attenuation of these continua on the predicted enlr spectrum .",
    "models of the observed enlr emission are discussed in section 2 .",
    "we examine in section 3 if the model which best fits the enlr line emission can also explain the observed extended soft x - ray continuum .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "the shape of the central - source continuum in ngc  1068 has been derived from two sources .",
    "the uv and x - ray continua ware assumed from pier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , while the rest of the continuum shape was taken to follow that of the canonical agn continuum given in mathews and ferland ( 1987 ) .",
    "these two continua are shown in fig.1 .    the bolometric flux from the scattering material in the spectral range 10@xmath210@xmath3 hz is @xmath22 erg @xmath5 s@xmath1 ( pier et al . 1994 ) , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath23 erg s@xmath1 for an adopted distance to ngc  1068 of 14.4  mpc ( tully 1988 ) . adopting this as a minimum central - source luminosity",
    ", our photoionization models were calculated within the luminosity range @xmath23 to @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ( log  l  @xmath2444.55 ) .",
    "the luminosity upper limit was chosen to be approximately half the ir luminosity of ngc  1068 ( l@xmath25 erg s@xmath1 ) found by telesco and harper ( 1980 ) , as about half of the ir emission could be due to dust heated by stars .",
    "evans and dopita ( 1986 ) and bergeron et al . ( 1989 ) detected extended high - excitation emission from two knots in ngc  1068 located between 29.4 and 43.5 arcsec and between 24.7 and 40.5 arcsec north - east of the centre .",
    "apart from these , there is also a small [ ] emission patch in the south - west between 18.2 and 28.8 arcsec from the centre .",
    "however the strong [ ] emission extends further out than the balmer emission , and is detected up to 45 arcsec from the centre ( bergeron et al .",
    "1989 ) . in our calculations we have adopted a location for the high - excitation enlr region in ngc  1068 ( henceforth called the [ ] zone ) between 25 and 45 arcsec from the centre ( or between 1.8 and 3.24 kpc ) .",
    "all calculations were carried out using cloudy ( version c90.01 ; ferland 1991 ) for a plane - parallel slab of gas with solar abundances . because the high - excitation emissivity in the enlr depends strongly on the shape of the ionizing continuum , we calculated the line fluxes taking into account the attenuation of the ionizing continuum by gas at radii between 5 and 25 arcsec from the centre ( section 2.4 ; nazarova et al .",
    "1997 ) . the transmitted portion of the central - source continuum and the diffuse continuum ( emitted by the low density gas ) were calculated for 6 different luminosities of the central - source within the luminosity range given in section 2.1 , with 5 different column densities and different corresponding gas densities .",
    "the sum of the transmitted continuum plus the diffuse continuum was then taken as the incident continuum at the starting radius of the [ ] zone ( 25 arcsec from the centre ) .",
    "the shape of the unattenuated , central - source continuum and the sum of the transmitted and diffuse continua are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the shape of the attenuated continua depend on both the luminosity of the central - source and the column density of the attenuating gas .",
    "the attenuation is large in the euv / soft x - ray range when the gas is effectively ionization bounded for the dominant absorption species .",
    "it should be noted that the shape of the sum of the transmitted and diffuse continua is quite different from the transmitted continuum alone . adding the locally - emitted diffuse continua reduces the depth of the gap in the continuum between approximately 1 and 100 ryd .",
    "the emission of the high - excitation [ ] @xmath6 and [ ] @xmath26 , 5007 lines depend on the shape of the continuum in this region as it controls the parent ion populations .",
    "the electron temperature of the [ ] zone is shown in fig.3 for different luminosities of the central - source .",
    "the sharp drop in temperature after column densities 10@xmath27 @xmath5 and 10@xmath28 @xmath5 respectively for low luminosities ( log  l  @xmath2442.85 ) is not shown . for high luminosities ( log  l  @xmath2944.55 ) the temperature remains high enough to produce strong emission in the high - excitation lines even for high column densities ( n@xmath30 @xmath5 ) .",
    "since we use in our calculations the sum of the transmitted and diffuse continua as the incident continuum for the [ ] zone , we need to consider the geometry of the gas which attenuates the central - source continuum . as the physical size of the region containing the attenuating gas",
    "is fixed ( 525 arcsec from the centre ) , varying its total column density n@xmath31 between 10@xmath32 and 10@xmath33 @xmath5 implies a variation in gas density between 0.023 and 234 @xmath34 , assuming the gas is homogeneously distributed and that the filling - factor remains the same .",
    "the starting radius for the region containing the attenuating gas has been taken to be 5 arcsec , as this is believed to be the maximum size of the region containing the material obscuring the central - source from direct view ( pier et al .",
    "the contribution from scattered central continuum to the illumination of the [ ] zone depends on the optically thickness for electron scattering ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the scattered continuum will also be absorbed in the gas with corresponding optical thickness ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "as @xmath35 is 10@xmath37 times less than @xmath36 we can neglect the contribution of the scattered continuum to the shape of the ionizing continuum for the [ ] zone .",
    "the high - excitation [ ] @xmath6 line and part , possibly most , of the [ ] @xmath7 and heii@xmath12 lines beyond 25 arcsec are produced by highly - ionized , low density gas in the enlr .",
    "the emission from low density gas in the [ ] zone corresponding to various total column densities is shown in fig.4 for different luminosities of the central - source .",
    "the two parallel lines show the observed ratios in the line intensities for different parts of the enlr of ngc  1068 derived from evans and dopita ( 1986 ) and bergeron et al .",
    "from fig.4 it appears that the observed line fluxes could be fitted with a luminosity of the central - source higher than log  l  @xmath29 .    adding emission from high density gas , which could explain the observed low ionization line emission ( discussed below ) , will increase the emission in the h@xmath21 , [ ] @xmath7 , and heii@xmath38 lines , but makes little contribution to the emission in [ ] @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we rule out luminosities below log  l  @xmath29 as they fail to explain the minimum observed flux in [ ] @xmath6 even with a filling - factor of 1 . for luminosities higher than log  l  @xmath29 the filling - factor in the [ ] zone might be less than 1 in order to fit the observed line intensities .",
    "we note that the predicted [ ] @xmath6 flux is lower than [ ] @xmath7 for all luminosities , in agreement with the observed f(@xmath6)/f(@xmath7 ) line ratio which varies between 0.26 and 0.58 in different parts of the enlr ( bergeron et al .",
    "as can be seen in fig.5 , a small change in column density produces a quite dramatic change in the f(@xmath6)/f(@xmath7 ) ratio .",
    "this is due to the approximately 1.7 times higher photon energy needed to produce [ ] than [ ] .",
    "hence the former is more sensitive to the column .",
    "the observed f(@xmath6)/f(@xmath7 ) ratio can be fitted for a small range of `` critical '' column densities from 10@xmath39 @xmath5 to 10@xmath27 @xmath5 for the luminosity range considered here .",
    "the presence of strong emission in low ionization lines such as h@xmath21 , [ ] @xmath9 , [ ] @xmath40 , [ ] @xmath41 , 6583 , and [ ] @xmath42 , 6731 indicates emission from low filling - factor high density gas , similar to regions , in the enlr of ngc  1068 .",
    "this emission is in addition to that from low density gas .",
    "the emission from high density gas was therefore also calculated for the 6 different luminosity models . because the most probable column density obtained from analysis of the low density gas is n@xmath4 @xmath5",
    "( fig.5 ) , the sum of transmitted and diffuse continua for this column density was used to calculate the continuum incident on the high density gas in the [ ] zone .",

    "we used cloudy to calculate the reflected continuum for different luminosities .",
    "we assume the reflected continuum is the continuum emitted from the illuminated face of the cloud back in the direction of the central - source ( i.e. into 2@xmath55 sr ) .",
    "for a plane - parallel slab the proportion of the reflected continuum in the direction to the observer could vary from @xmath56 ( when the enlr is located in the plane of the sky ) to zero ( when we see the nucleus through the enlr ) .",
    "the optical images imply that the galaxy disk , and therefore presumably the enlr gas , inclination is 40@xmath57@xmath583@xmath57 ( brinks et al .",

    "this gas could result from a hot outflowing wind driven by the putative central hard x - ray source , or through shocks driven by the radio jets ( wilson & elvis 1997 ) .",
