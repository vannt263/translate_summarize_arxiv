    "there is currently great interest in the statistical mechanics of finite  sized versions of systems that display phase transitions in the infinite  size limit . recently",
    ", atomic clusters have provided an example of a finite system whose caloric curve may be measured , yielding evidence for a `` melting '' transition over a broad range of temperatures.@xcite the clusters involved in these experiments were both small  ( containing from a few atoms to several hundreds of atoms ) and free  ( not supported on a surface ) .",
    "now , according to old thermodynamic models,@xcite a small particle should melt at a lower temperature than the bulk because of the effect of the surface , with the reduction in melting temperature being roughly proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radius of the particle .",
    "this effect has been verified quantitatively for particles of mesoscopic size  ( upwards of several thousand atoms ) supported on a surface.@xcite more recently , however , in a series of experiments on free na clusters in the size range 55 to 350 , haberland and co ",
    "workers@xcite found that the simple @xmath3 scaling is lost ; they did observe a substantial lowering  ( by about 30% ) of the melting temperature compared to bulk sodium , but accompanied by rather large size ",
    "dependent fluctuations in the melting temperatures . in spite of considerable theoretical effort,@xcite",
    "the precise form of the observed fluctuations remains unexplained to date .",
    "as is well known , metallic clusters  ( such as sodium ) possess the same first few `` magic '' sizes as atomic nuclei , @xmath5 , 8 , 20 , ",
    ", @xcite corresponding to particularly stable systems in which the delocalized valence electrons form closed fermionic shells . unlike nuclei ,",
    "however , metallic clusters also contain positively charged ions , which are much heavier than electrons and may be treated classically to a good approximation , leading to the possibility that geometric packing effects may enter into competition with electronic shell effects in determining certain properties .",
    "the precise pattern of melting points observed experimentally@xcite shows maxima at sizes that correspond neither to magic numbers of valence electrons nor to complete mackay icosahedra of ions , thereby suggesting a subtle interplay between geometric and quantum electronic effects.@xcite    reliable simulations to determine the melting properties of clusters are made difficult by a combination of two crucial requirements : the need to compute the ionic potential  energy surface accurately , and the need for high statistics to converge the features in the caloric curve .",
    "good statistics have been obtained using a variety of _ parametrized _ interatomic potentials,@xcite as well as with a treatment of the valence electrons in the extended thomas ",
    "fermi  ( etf)@xcite and related density  based  ( db ) approximations.@xcite but these attempts have failed to reproduce crucial features of the experimental results , such as the precise pattern of observed melting temperatures .",
    "an interesting observation is that in all earlier simulations the melting temperature of na@xmath0 has been considerably underestimated  ( by about 100  k lower than the experimental value ) .",
    "clearly , what is required is a more realistic treatment of interacting electrons , in particular , one that incorporates correctly electronic shell effects , which are explicitly excluded from the above  mentioned work using parametrized , etf , or db potentials .",
    "we have recently demonstrated the power of _ ab initio _ density  functional theory  ( dft ) , in the kohn  sham ( ks ) formulation , for simulating the melting properties of small sn@xcite and ga@xcite clusters in the size range 10@xmath620 .",
    "unfortunately , the computational expense of the ks approach , combined with the relatively large sizes of the na data  ( @xmath7 55350 ) , have so far made it difficult to perform ks simulations with high statistics in the size range of the experiment .",
    "recently , a ks simulation of na@xmath8,@xcite performed with limited statistics , shows encouraging results , with an estimated melting temperature @xmath9 between 300 and 350  k [ @xmath10  k for na@xmath8 ] .    in this paper , we report the first _ ab initio _ ks thermodynamic calculations up to size @xmath7 142 , within the size range of the experiment .",
    "we present simulations for na@xmath12 with @xmath7 55 , 92 , and 142 , each with total sampling times of the order of 23  ns . for each size",
    "there is a pronounced peak in specific  heat curve , whose position agrees with the experimental finding to better than 8% .",
    "this error is also the approximate level of statistical error for the simulation times used , suggesting that a ks approach is capable of quantitative predictions of melting temperatures at this level of accuracy or better .",
    "analysis of the structural and dynamical information in these simulations sheds new light on the respective roles of geometric and electronic effects in this intriguing problem .",
    "our simulations have been carried out using isokinetic born  oppenheimer molecular  dynamics with ultrasoft pseudopotentials in the local density approximation , as implemented in the vasp package.@xcite we have carried out calculations for up to 17 temperatures for na@xmath0 and 14 temperatures for na@xmath1 and na@xmath2 in the temperature range 100 to 500  k. the simulation times are 90  ps for temperatures below @xmath9 , and between 150350  ps for temperatures near the melting transition or higher .",
    "such high statistics have to be performed in order to achieve good convergence of thermodynamic indicators such as the root - mean - square bond - length fluctuation @xmath13.@xcite in fig .  [ fig.na55.delta_conv ]",
    ", we show @xmath13 for na@xmath0 as a function of the total time used to compute the time averages .",
    "we have discarded at least the first 25  ps at each temperature to allow for thermalization .",
    "this plot shows that , for lower temperatures ( below the transition temperature , that is , @xmath14  k ) simulation times of the order of 6070  ps are sufficient for convergence .",

    "[ results - discussion ] . ) for the higher temperatures ( 300  k and above ) , at least 100300  ps are required to achieve proper convergence . however , near the melting transition , namely , around 270 and 280  k , @xmath13 is rather poorly converged even up to about 300  ps , indicating the need for higher statistics at these temperatures .",
    "further , with increase in the cluster size , these averaging times may increase , making the _ ab initio _ simulations of larger clusters very difficult .",
    "an energy cutoff of 3.6  ry is used for the plane  wave expansion of the wavefunction , with a convergence in the total energy of the order of 0.00010.0005  ev . increasing the energy cutoff to ,",
    "say , about 22  ry causes a change of only 0.31% and 0.28% , respectively , in the binding energy and bond  length of the na@xmath15 dimer .",
    "we have also checked these results against those obtained by the projected augmented wave  ( paw ) method,@xcite taking only the @xmath16 electrons in the core and with an energy cutoff of about 51  ry .",
    "the na@xmath15 binding energy and bond  length according to the present dft method differ by less than 3% from those given by the paw method ( the paw method yielding smaller energies and bond  lengths ) .",
    "the dft method employed for our thermodynamic simulations can therefore be considered to be of comparable accuracy to the ( nearly ) all  electron method .",
    "the lengths of the simulation cells for na@xmath0 , na@xmath1 , and na@xmath2 are 24 , 28 , and 31   , respectively .",

    "clearly , all the plots overlap , indicating that about 46 scf iterations are sufficient to obtain a good convergence of the potential  energy .",
    "the force convergence test has been performed on the na@xmath17 cluster at 400  k. the forces are converged up to about 0.0001  ev /  in just 4 scf iterations . hence , in all our calculations , we have used a minimum of 4 , and in some cases up to 5 or 6 iterations for self  consistency .",

    "about 25 of the lowest of these structures were then used as input for relaxation within the ks approach .",

    "this is true both for the ks data , which include electronic shell effects explicitly , and for the sma , db , and etf@xcite data , which do not .",
    "we are thus led to conclude that geometry plays a significant role in the melting ",

    "this suggests quite strongly that the high melting point of na@xmath0 relative to na@xmath2 is due to electronic shell effects , since these are the main new element in our ks approach not included in previous simulations .",
    "this is particularly clear in the case of the db and etf methods . in these approaches , quantum shell effects",

    "wheeler parameters@xcite  ( not shown ) indicates the cluster to be undergoing shape fluctuations around a net prolate deformation .",
    "a typical deformed liquidlike structure is shown in fig.[fig.struc](d ) .",
    "a related phenomenon was observed earlier by rytknen _ _ et al.__@xcite for na@xmath43 , except that the magic na@xmath43 cluster underwent only an",
    "_ octupole _",

    "interestingly , simulations of na@xmath0 carried out by us within the sma model do not show a deformation upon melting , but rather the cluster remains essentially spherical at all temperatures , @xmath41 .",
    "since the sma model explicitly excludes quantum shell effects , we believe that the deformation of na@xmath0 is due to the quantal jahn  teller distortion of the open  shell system of valence electrons . as further support for this explanation ,",
    "we note that the mean prolate deformation in the liquidlike state agrees well with that found in jellium  model calculations for neutral na@xmath0 that we have carried out , which yield a uniaxial prolate deformation with a major to minor",
    " axis ratio of @xmath44 , in close agreement with the liquidlike simulations . evidently , the compact ground",
    " state structure is favored by the possibility of geometric packing into an icosahedron , while in the nonrigid liquidlike state the cluster can lower its free energy by undergoing a spontaneous shape deformation . on this reasoning ,",
    "the magic na@xmath1 cluster would not be expected to deform upon melting , consistent with the observation . on the other hand , the na@xmath2 cluster _ would _ be expected to deform , at least slightly ; presumably , the jahn  teller forces here are sufficiently weak that any deformation is not statistically significant .",
    "note that , as mentioned earlier , the melting temperature is strongly influenced by the potential  energy difference @xmath21 between liquidlike and solidlike states .",
    "therefore , even if the ground ",
    "state is quite spherical , as for na@xmath0 , the melting temperature may still be influenced by important quantal deformation effects entering only in the liquidlike state .",
    "the ks simulations undertaken here incorporate all these various effects correctly .",
    "in conclusion , the ks approach appears to be capable of making quantitative predictions of melting temperatures and latent heats in na clusters .",
    "na@xmath0 , na@xmath1 , and na@xmath2 are each magic or nearly magic , but only na@xmath0 and na@xmath2 are also close to icosahedral shell closures .",
    "the fact that na@xmath1 melts at a significantly lower temperature than the other two shows that geometric effects are very important in determining the pattern of melting temperatures observed experimentally . however , electronic shell effects can play an important role too , both in influencing overall binding energies and bond  lengths as a function of size , and indirectly via shape deformation effects that may arise differently in the solidlike and liquidlike states . for an accurate treatment of the metallic bonding , and a quantitative prediction of melting temperatures and latent heats , it is essential to incorporate electronic shell effects appropriately , as is possible , for example , within the ks approach used here .",
    "this is especially true for the smaller sizes of clusters .",
