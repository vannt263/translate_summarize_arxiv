    "in the standard paradigm for planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and chapters 4 - 6 in @xcite , large and massive protostellar discs eventually evolve into much less massive `` protoplanetary '' discs .",
    "the latter represent the end phase of star formation and the beginning phase of planet formation .",
    "such discs can be now observed around nearby pre - main sequence stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "an especially interesting sub - class of protoplanetary discs are the so - called `` transition discs '' , broadly defined as objects showing mid - ir excess above the protostar s emission , but lacking the corresponding near - ir excess .",
    "near - ir emission is characteristic of the inner @xmath1 few au disc region , and mid - ir emission is a signature of the outer @xmath2 tens of au disc .",
    "therefore , transition discs are interpreted as protoplanetary discs with inner holes .",
    "high - resolution sub - millimetre continuum images of several sources , such as lkh@xmath3 330 @xcite and gm tau @xcite , indeed show sharp inner holes tens of au in radius and thus confirm validity of this interpretation of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of transition discs .",
    "since gas discs around protostars disappear with time , discs with inner holes are believed to be the discs that are at the beginning of their `` disc clearing stage '' .",
    "since the fraction of such systems is low , e.g. , @xmath4 of the sample , this was taken to mean that the transitional disc phase takes @xmath5% of the disc lifetime , e.g. , from @xmath6 yrs to a few times that @xcite .",
    "such a behaviour naturally appears in models in which the disc is first evolving on a long viscous time scale and is then photo - evaporated rapidly when the accretion rate drops to low @xmath7yr values @xcite .",
    "it then came as a considerable surprise that transition discs with large @xmath8 au to @xmath9 au holes are quite common among _ mm - bright discs _ : recent observations of @xcite show that these discs comprise between @xmath10 to @xmath11 of their sample of such objects .",
    "these massive discs should not really be the ones in the process of dispersal yet .",
    "the disc photo - evaporation models can not easily create such large inner holes for the high accretion rates observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , @xcite suggest that `` ... either ( i ) `` transition discs '' are a misnomer and these objects do not physically represent an evolutionary stage from disc - bearing and disc - less systems ; or ( ii ) discs with inner holes can have multiple physical origins and the two populations shown in the data indicate two distinct classes of objects . ''",
    "the consensus seems to be building up to blame one or several massive planets per parent star , rather than disc photo - evaporation , for creating the observed gaps in the transition discs with large gaps @xcite .",
    "physically , a giant planet of a few jupiter mass or heavier pushes the gas away radially from its location by applying gravitational torques on the disc @xcite .",
    "this interaction first opens a wide gap in the protoplanetary disc .",
    "the inner disc then drains onto the protostar while the outer is held off by the planet ; this results in a completely evacuated inner hole in the disc @xcite , potentially explaining the observations of large holes in transition discs .",
    "however , many of the transition discs with inner holes have large _ gas _ accretion rates onto the protostar , e.g. , up to @xmath12/yr , requiring that only the dust flow was interrupted by the planet but not that of the gas @xcite . one plausible way out of this is a combination of dust filtration on gap edges and dust growth in the inner disc @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite showed that since gas pressure gradient at the outer edge of a gap opened by a massive planet is positive , rather than negative in a disc without a gap , grain particles migrate outward in the frame comoving with the gas .",
    "this contrasts with the usual situation when dust grains migrate inward .",
    "the outward migration speed depends on the size of a particle and the properties of the gap , but generally large grain particles , e.g. , those larger than @xmath13 mm migrate outward more rapidly than gas moves inward due to viscous torques",
    ". therefore such particles are stopped effectively at the gap from penetrating the inner disc . however , smaller particles ( smaller than about 10 @xmath14 m , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are so tightly bound to the gas by aerodynamical friction that they must follow the gas motion .",
    "these particles would follow the gas into the inner disc , through the gap , and would then still be observable in nir , in contradiction to the observations @xcite . to solve",
    "this difficulty , @xcite propose that small dust particles that did penetrate the gap grow to large sizes , so that their opacity drops to barely detectable levels .    in this paper",
    "we propose a completely different take on the problem of dust - poor accretion onto the protostars , based on a crucial element of the new `` tidal downsizing '' scenario ( td ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for planet formation ",
    "_ mass loss from the giant protoplanets_. this mass loss process is unique to td scenario .",
    "the two other models for forming giant planets  the core accretion ( ca ) and the gravitation disc instability ( gi ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assume that planets always _ grow _ in mass by accretion of gas from the disc as they age . in both of these models",
    "the inner dust - poor disc must be a continuation of the larger scale accretion disc , perhaps modified by the presence of the planet as discussed above . in td model , however , most of the protoplanets , having been formed in the outer cold disc at @xmath15 au , give their gaseous envelopes back to the _ inner disc _ when they migrate sufficiently close to the parent star ( see simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that ( i ) td planets , being initially more massive than ca planets , are able to open complete gaps in the protoplanetary discs . therefore , in our model for transition discs with large inner cavities , the outer dust - rich accretion flow , in both gas and dust , is completely disconnected from the inner region .",
    "( ii ) td planets must loose their envelopes on the way to becoming the present day planets .",
    "the accretion flow inward of the gap can be `` restarted '' when these envelopes are accreted by the protostar @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the protoplanet behaves like a lower mass version of the mass - loosing secondary in a compact stellar binary system with mass transfer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "( iii ) crucially , the envelopes of td protoplanets are dust - poor @xcite because the dust is expected to sediment to their centres .",
    "therefore , we propose that the inner accretion flow of dust - poor transition discs is nothing less than the planet s envelope devouring stage of tidal downsizing for one of the inner planets .    below we",
    "explore this model in greater detail .",
    "the first suggestion that planets are initially much more massive than they presently are , was made , to the best of our knowledge , by @xcite , who proposed that planets grew from self - gravitating condensations in the solar nebula .",
    "his figure 1 shows that he considered it quite possible that protoplanets were initially much more massive .",
    "specifically , on page 9 on his manuscript he suggests that each of the solar system planet was formed from @xmath20.003 solar masses of gas and dust , a guess that , amazingly , is consistent with the td model within a factor of a few .",
    "@xcite added practical detail to this scenario , explaining how the differentiation of materials within such proto - planets could have taken place .",
    "they showed that microscopic grains grow and sediment to the centre of such gas clumps within a few thousand years ( cf .",
    "also * ? ? ?",
    "proto - earth formation in this picture is complete when the gas envelope of the proto - planet is removed by solar tides .",
    "however , since the process of planet migration was unknown until later @xcite , a physically complete and self - consistent scenario for this _ top - down _",
    "scenario for planet formation was not found , and the model was essentially given up @xcite until very recently @xcite .",
    "the modern version of the top - down scenario is essentially gravitational disc instability model for planet formation upgraded by the physics of giant planet migration and disruption . in the td scenario , massive @xmath16 ( e.g. ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gaseous clumps are formed in the outer disc by the disc s gi .",
    "the clumps then migrate inward , while dust sediments to the centre of the clumps @xcite . a partial removal of their gas envelopes by gravitational tides , irradiation or other effects @xcite results in formation of metal - enriched giant planets such as jupiter or saturn , whereas a complete removal of the gas results in terrestrial like planets .",
    "td model has direct connections to protostellar disc evolution .",
    "a story line very similar to td scenario , but minus the role of dust grains , has been developing in the field of protostellar evolution since @xcite .",
    "these authors found that massive gaseous clumps formed by gi in the outer disc migrate rapidly inward and get `` accreted '' by the star in bursts ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such accretion bursts appear to be a natural explanation for the fu ori outbursts of young protostars where the star accretes mass at rates as high as @xmath17  yr@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of this episodic accretion model for the fu ori outbursts by @xcite confirmed its potential promise , and also showed that the inner disc behaviour may be additionally modulated by the thermal ionisation instability .",
    "this implies that both episodic accretion and thermal ionisation instability @xcite may play a role in explaining the observed fu ori outbursts .",
    "the other side of this bursty accretion picture  long periods of relatively low protostellar accretion rates  may naturally explain @xcite the `` luminosity problem '' of young stars @xcite .",
    "a sufficiently massive protoplanet may open a gap in the accretion disc and thus regulate the rate of mass flow onto the protostar @xcite .",
    "@xcite show with 2d simulations that the inner disc surface density is decreased by a factor of 10 ( compared with a disc with no embedded planet ) when the parameter @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the roche lobe radius , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the reynolds number , which can be re - written as @xmath24 for the @xcite disc model with viscosity parameter @xmath3 and the disc vertical aspect ratio @xmath25 . for @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , the smaller the value of @xmath30 , the deeper the gap ( the stronger the suppression of the inner disc ) . for @xmath31 , for example , @xmath32 .",
    "such a massive planet opens an infinitely deep gap in the disc according to equation ( 13 ) of @xcite , that is , the inner disc is completely cut off from the outer one by the planet .",
    "equation [ p ] predicts , on the other hand , that @xmath33 for @xmath34 , thus the gap is expected to be leaky , so that @xmath35 of gas is able to filter through to the inner disc @xcite . in accord with these results , @xcite found that protoplanetary discs with @xmath36 protoplanets feature infinitely deep gaps , so that the inner disc empties out on the protoplanet and becomes devoid of any gas flow for a period of time .",
    "given these results , protoplanets are much more important for the evolution of protoplanetary discs in td scenario than they are for discs with ca - built planets .",
    "indeed , in td scenario , _ every _ protoplanet , including those that go on to eventually make `` tiny '' planets such as the earth is initially quite massive , e.g. , from a few to over 10 @xmath37 . in other words ,",
    "_ essentially every _",
    "planet before the downsizing step may be able to open a very deep gap in the td scenario .",
    "thus we expect discs with empty or very strongly depressed inner flows to be a much more frequent feature in the td picture .",
    "if we accept that fu ori outbursts are produced by giant protoplanets being torn into pieces and then accreted by their protostars , and that this happens @xmath38 times during assembly of a typical star @xcite , we would expect that discs with inner holes / strong depressions should exist for a good fraction , e.g. , one comparable to unity , of all mm - bright ( that is massive ) protoplanetary discs .",
    "in addition to this , td scenario planets not only open the gaps and thus hold off accretion of gas and dust beyond their orbits , they can also feed their protostars with a significant amount of matter , given their masses . to appreciate this",
    ", we note that the total mass of all the solar system protoplanets in the ca framework is about 1.5 jupiter masses , while in td picture this is somewhere between 40 and 80 jupiter masses ( assuming that solar system planets were built from gas embryos of mass between 5 and 10 jupiter masses ) .    with this in mind",
    ", we echo the suggestion of @xcite that some transitions discs may not represent systems where the discs are being removed .",
    "we suggest that the flow of matter in these discs , both in gas and dust , is temporarily interrupted by very deep gaps . while the outer disc is held off by one or more embedded planets ( as suggested earlier by a number of authors , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the inner disc is fed by dust - poor gas lost by one or more planets in the gap .    in the simulations of @xcite , the period of the completely empty inner disc ( zero accretion rate onto the protostar )",
    "ends when the protoplanet is pushed deep enough so that it fills its roche lobe and starts loosing the mass through the inner lagrangian l1 point .",
    "the inner disc is then quickly re - filled _ by the material lost by the planet _ and accretes onto the protostar at very high accretion rate , leading to an fu ori - like outburst .",
    "these simulations confirm the earlier suggestions by @xcite that tidal disruption of giant protoplanets may produce accretion outbursts with properties required to explain the fu ori outbursts .",
    "below we consider whether a physically similar model may explain the transition discs with _",
    "large _ inner dust cavities .",
    "* to avoid potential confusion , we point out that the outer self - gravitating portions of relatively massive protoplanetary discs may have larger @xmath25 than the value of 0.05 used in equation ( 1 ) above , so that the protoplanets manage to migrate in type - i regime there ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although the transition in the migration regime of such massive protoplanets is a subject of ongoing research ( s .- j .",
    "paardekooper , private communication ) , the transition is generally expected to occur where the disc mass interior of the planet becomes comparable to that of the protoplanet , so that type - i migration rate slows down ( see also the physically related case of a binary super - massive black hole migration in * ? ? ?",
    "we shall first consider steady - state scenarios  and will find them unlikely  in which the inner dust - poor accretion disc is in a qasi - steady state , so that the mass is deposited into the disc by the protoplanet at the same rate as it is accreted by the protostar .",
    "an example of such a situation is quasi - equilibria found in some of the @xcite simulations .    in td scenario ,",
    "giant protoplanets go through two stages on the way to becoming fully fledged dense giant gas planets @xcite .",
    "the first stage begins with formation of the protoplanet in the outer cold disc by gravitational instability .",
    "the `` first protoplanet '' is a rather fluffy gas clump in which hydrogen is molecular ; the clump s central temperature is @xmath2 hundreds of kelvin and its radial extent is a few to ten au .",
    "these clumps cool rapidly : within some @xmath39 to at most @xmath40 yrs ( depending on the clump s mass and grain opacity , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the central temperature approaches @xmath41 k at which point hydrogen molecules dissociate rapidly , and the clump collapses hydrodynamically to sizes of the order of @xmath42 au or even smaller ( cf .  3.4 in * ? ? ?",
    "this collapse begins the second stage in the prtoplanet evolution , when most of hydrogen is atomic or partially ionised .",
    "this picture is very similar to the evolution from the first to second cores in star formation @xcite , although here mass of the protoplanet may remain fixed during contraction and collapse .",
    "we shall thus call protoplanets dominated by atomic or inosed hydrogen `` second planets '' below for brevity .",
    "mass transfer from a roche lobe - filling secondary to the primary has been a subject of numerous papers in the context of cataclysmic binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary s mass loss rate is found to be a very strong function of @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the planet s radius . before the roche lobe of the secondary",
    "is filled , @xmath45 , the mass transfer rate has an exponential form reflecting the exponential decrease of density with height in the stellar atmosphere ( cf .",
    "eq . 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath46\\ ; , \\label{dotm1}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the planet s mass , @xmath48 is the scale height of the planet s atmosphere , @xmath14 is the mean molecular weight , here taken to be @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the photosphere s density and sound speed , respectively .",
    "the hill s radius is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the planet - star separation .",
    "@xmath55 is approximately equal to the roche lobe radius .",
    "here we are interested in planets situated at @xmath56 au .",
    "@xcite , using a simple @xmath57 dust opacity model for first protoplanets , obtains that at large time @xmath58 since the formation of the clump , the clump s radius is @xmath59  au  @xmath60  yr@xmath61 , independently of the clump s mass . given the planet s luminosity ( see  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtain planet s photosphere  effective  temperature of about 100 k. the photosphere s scale height is then very small compared to @xmath44 , @xmath62 this shows that unless @xmath44 is almost exactly equal to @xmath55 , the factor @xmath63 is very small . speaking qualitatively , the roche lobe overflow rate is nearly zero when @xmath64 and then suddenly becomes very large ( up to @xmath65  yr@xmath18 ) when @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "it would thus be a surprising coincidence to have the planet to loose mass at the observed gas accretion rate range ( @xmath67  yr@xmath18 ) .",
    "the arguments presented just above are for the first protoplanets . as we mentioned above , massive @xmath16 h@xmath68 clumps survive only for @xmath2 ( few to few tens ) of thousand years before collapsing to much denser second configuration .",
    "this is too short given that transition discs probably exist for @xmath6 years : finding a protoplanet in the first stage inside the transition disc cavity should be unlikely .",
    "the protoplanet may be inflated by tidal torques @xcite if its orbit is eccentric , but the relevant time scales ( e.g. ,  3.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are longer than the hubble time at @xmath56  au .",
    "the second stage protoplanets are much more compact than the first stage ones , so that the ratio @xmath69 is yet smaller for them .",
    "we conclude that a quasi - steady state tidal disruption ( roche lobe overflow ) of giant protoplanets is unlikely to match the observed protostellar accretion rates of transition disc systems .",
    "alternatively , planets may loose mass by photo - evaporation @xcite . however , @xcite showed that mass loss of the second stage planets due to photo - evaporation does not exceed @xmath70  yr@xmath18 even for planets located at distances as close as @xmath71 au from the star .",
    "the weight of the argument is best appreciated by considering the energy - limited photo - evaporation , which is essentially the maximum possible outflow rate in which all the ionising power goes into driving the outflow , with no re - radiation losses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of stellar radiation intercepted by the planet is @xmath72 , which is only @xmath73 for a few @xmath37 planet completely filling its roche lobe . the combined x - ray and uv luminosity of a typical t - tauri star is @xmath74 a few @xmath75 erg  s@xmath18 .",
    "this yields the maximum outflow rate @xmath76 where @xmath77  km  s@xmath18 is the sound speed in the evaporated outflow .",
    "since @xmath44 is only a few percent of @xmath55 for the second stage planets at @xmath78 au , we conclude that the photo - evaporative mass loss rate is completely inadequate to explain the observed gas accretion rates of up to @xmath79  yr@xmath18 in the @xcite sample .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated the importance of rotation for clumps formed in the outer gravitationally unstable disc during the transition from the first to the second protoplanetary stages .",
    "in particular , when h@xmath68 dissociation occurs only @xmath80% of mass of the initial clump collapses into a quasi - spherical second planet , with the rest orbiting the collapsed part in a thickish ( @xmath81 ) rotationally supported circum - planetary disc .",
    "this disc ( instead of the planet s atmosphere ) could in principle play the role of the dust - poor mass reservoir being stripped away and consumed by the parent star .",
    "circum - planetary discs are truncated by tidal torques from the star at around @xmath82 to @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "thus their outer edges are still quite far from the l1 point . the most likely way to loose these discs is by photo - evaporation @xcite .",
    "however , applying the equation a7 in @xcite for the present case , the rate at which the discs are likely to be photo - evaporating is modest , @xmath84  yr@xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , this is likely to be an over - estimate , since we find that h@xmath68 molecule densities in the evaporative flows would be @xmath85  @xmath86 , and therefore the h@xmath68 gas should self - shield itself from the fuv radiation ( see the end of  2.1 and  2.3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further reducing the estimate . finally , the path of the protostar s photo - ionising radiation to the planet is likely to be blocked by the observed inner gas accretion flows since the inner disc aspect ratio ( @xmath87 ) may be larger than @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , while it appears clear that circum - planetary gas discs can be efficiently removed by photo - evaporation on long time scales @xcite , it seems that their steady - state mass loss is insufficiently large to explain protostellar accretion rates of up to @xmath79  yr@xmath18 .",
    "the accretion disc viscous time at radius @xmath89 is @xmath90 where @xmath91  au , @xmath3 is the @xcite viscosity parameter , @xmath25 is the disc geometrical aspect ratio , and @xmath92 is the keplerian angular frequency . the accretion disc viscous time is comparable with the estimated lifetime of the transition disc phase , suggesting that the disc may not necessarily be in a quasi - steady state .",
    "this in turn implies that the observed proto - stellar accretion rates do not have to be equal to _ instantaneous _ mass loss rates from the planet(s ) in the scenario we propose .",
    "suppose that a massive gas planet has lost a @xmath93 of its dust - poor envelope .",
    "the average accretion rate onto the protostar as the result of this is @xmath94 where @xmath95  yr ) .",
    "one expects that initially the accretion rate is higher than this estimate but then decays to a somewhat lower value . statistically speaking ,",
    "one is more likely to catch the longer decaying part of this accretion episode , so that the range of the observed accretion rates in the @xcite sample appears qualitatively natural in this picture .    to test these ideas",
    ", we have used the code of @xcite to investigate the disc - planet system evolution in the case of a partial envelope or circum - planetary disc removal from a massive planet . in this calculation",
    "we assume that the planet opened a gap in the accretion disc and that the inner disc has drained onto the star before the calculation begins .",
    "we then assume that the planet quickly looses a set amount of its envelope through the l1 point into the inner disc and then simulate the longer term evolution of the disc - planet system .",
    "figure 1 presents one such calculation in which the initial mass and position of the planet is @xmath96 and @xmath97 au , respectively .",

    "the functional form used in equation [ sigma0 ] is the same as that used by @xcite to fit their observations .",
    "the normalisation constant @xmath102 is set by requiring the total disc mass to be @xmath103 .    the planet s mass loss in this calculation is assumed to be constant during the first @xmath104  yrs , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 , and then @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "this mimics an essentially instantaneous mass loss from the planet and its injection into the inner disc .",
    "initially the mass lost by the planet circularises in a ring at @xmath109 ( cf .",
    "equation 38 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , just inward of the planet s location .",
    "it then spreads viscously in both directions .",
    "the inward facing front of this vspreading ring then starts accreting onto the star , whereas the outer edge starts to exchange the angular momentum with the planet .",
    "the strong gravitational torques in this model keep the inner dust - poor accretion flow separated from the outer dust - rich disc .",
    "figure 1a presents snapshots of the disc surface density profile at four different times as indicated in the caption .",
    "* we emphasise that the accretion flow inward of the gap ( planet ) is the flow of matter dumped by the planet into the inner disc , so it is physically distinct from the outer dust - rich disc flow . * as the planet is pushed closer to the star , the outer disc edges closer as well . the inner disc shrinks in size and mass with time . by the last snapshot shown in the figure ( dotted curve ) ,",
    "almost all of the planet s envelope has been accreted by the star . shortly thereafter , the inner @xmath0 au feature a complete disc hole  in gas and dust at the same time .",
    "figure 1b shows the planet - star separation evolution ( solid curve ) and the dust hole radius evolution with time ( dotted ) .",
    "1c shows the accretion rate evolution onto the protostar .",
    "as expected from our analytical estimate above , the accretion rate onto the protostar indeed spans the range from 0 to @xmath12  yr@xmath18 .",
    "note that the dust hole size and the protostellar accretion rate are consistent in bulk with the observed mm - bright sample of @xcite for @xmath110 myr , which appears to be long enough to account for the significant frequency of the discs with large holes .",
    "in this paper we argued that protoplanets created in the framework of tidal downsizing scenario play a very important role for their protoplanetary discs , one much more important than do planets in the ca framework .",
    "since a typical planet is initially as massive as @xmath0 jupiter masses , td scenario predicts that discs with deep gaps opened by gravitational torques of the planets must be much more frequent than in the ca picture .",
    "furthermore , as shown by @xcite , such massive planet can ( temporarily ) completely stop the flow of gas and dust from the outer disc , which is not possible for any but only the most massive ca planets . finally , td planets may themselves feed inner accretion flows when their envelopes are removed by tides or other effects .",
    "we then suggested that the current conundrum of the observed mm - bright transition discs with large _ dust but not gas _ holes is resolved by combining the de - facto most popular scenario for the hole opening ",
    "massive planet(s ) inside the hole  with the td ideas , e.g. ,",
    "that massive gaseous protoplanets have their dust sedimented and locked into the cores and their dust - poor envelopes removed by tides or other effects .",
    "we then found that steady - state mass loss from either `` first planets '' ( molecular h@xmath68 ) or `` second planets '' ( atomic or ionised @xmath111 ) at the requisite rates of up to @xmath12  yr@xmath18 is unlikely (  3 ) . in brief , the first planets should cool too rapidly so are somewhat unlikely to be found in transition discs that are at least a fraction of a myr old ; the second planets are too compact to loose mass at the observed high rates .    however , in  4 we pointed out that the inner dust - poor flows inside the planet s orbit do not have to be steady state on the disc viscous time scale , which is of the order of @xmath4  myr at the observed dust edges ( equation [ tvisc ] ) .",
    "in particular , it appears possible that the observed accretion rates onto the protostars in the transition discs are the residual flows remaining after a few @xmath37 of dust - poor material was dumped by a planet into the inner disc .",
    "one interesting possibility that we shall pursue in a future paper is that such an episodic envelope removal from the planet is a consequence of a much larger x - ray and ionising flux from the protostar during the `` last '' fu ori outburst of the protostar ( the average steady - state fluxes do not result in large enough steady - state planet photo - evaporation , see  3 ) .",
    "one issue that requires future work is the exact mechanism through which protoplanets may loose the required amount of mass , which was simply postulated in our numerical calculation above .",
    "it is definitely easier for first stage planets to loose mass than it is for the more compact second stage ones .",
    "the first stage planets may however not live long enough for most of class ii protostars .",
    "it may be possible that some of these are younger than they appear due to swelling during fu ori outbursts @xcite .",
    "also , the first stage protoplanets may be supported against contraction due to internal energy release in the manner discussed in @xcite , and so may survive for longer than calculations neglecting the energy release at the core suggest ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    furthermore , there are other plausible ways in which the necessary dust - poor material can be lost by the planets inside the hole at the requested rates .",
    "if there is more than one massive planet inside the hole , their mutual interactions may drive secular evolution of the system , pumping planets eccentricities and/or changing their inclinations .",
    "one of the planets ( or the circum - planetary disc around it ) may then loose mass at each passage of the pericentre .",
    "the matter lost by the planet would then accrete onto the star on much longer viscous time scales in a seemingly steady - state accretion .",
    "we note that we did not consider here the photo - evaporation of the disc itself , a process which may influence the structure of the disc in additional ways ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we suggested that the process of dust sedimentation invoked in the tidal downsizing scenario for planet formation * potentially * provides an attractive explanation for the origin of the dust - poor accretion flows onto protostars in mm - bright transition disc systems .",
    "since dust grows and sediments to the centre of td protoplanets , their envelopes are dust - poor .",
    "to explain the fact that most planets are far less massive than the initial protoplanet mass of many jupiter masses , these envelopes must be lost to the parent stars .",
    "it would thus be natural to find at least some protostars to accrete dust - poor matter .",
    "the expected accretion rate of protoplanet s envelopes onto the protostar in this picture is , within an order of magnitude , @xmath112 a jupiter mass divided by @xmath113  yr ( the order of magnitude disc viscous time and also the estimated age of the transition discs ) .",
    "this predicts a typical protostar accretion rate @xmath114  yr@xmath18 , which is logarithmically in the middle of the observed accretion rates @xcite .",
    "* however , one difficulty of our model is in the required age of the protoplanets . _",
    "if _ the observed transitional discs are indeed @xmath13 myr past the massive self - gravitating stage of the disc evolution , then the protoplanets embedded in them would have to be similarly old . at this `` old '' age",
    "they should have contracted to very high densities ; it appears very hard for them to loose much mass by any of the mechanisms we considered in this paper .",
    "a resolution to this may be found if we over - estimate the age of the discs in these systems ; we under - estimate the planet mass loss at a fraction of a myr ; or this model does not apply to the older of the observed systems . *",

    "<S> we point out that protoplanets created in the framework of the tidal downsizing ( td ) theory for planet formation play a very important role for the evolution of accretion discs hosting them . </S>",
    "<S> since all td protoplanets are initially as massive as @xmath0 jupiter masses , they are able to open very deep gaps in their discs , and even completely isolate the inner disc flows from the outer ones . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in contrast to other planet formation theories , td protoplanets are mass donors for their protostars . </S>",
    "<S> one potentially observable signature of planets being devoured by their protostars are fu ori like outbursts , and episodic protostar accretion more generally , as discussed by a number of authors recently .    here we explore another observational implication of td hypothesis : dust poor inner accretion flows , which we believe may be relevant to some of the observed mm - bright transitional discs around protostars . in our model </S>",
    "<S> , a massive protoplanet interrupts the flow of the outer dust - rich disc on its protostar , and at the same time looses a part of its dust - poor envelope into the inner disc . </S>",
    "<S> this then powers the observed gas - but - no - dust accretion onto the star . upon a more detailed investigation </S>",
    "<S> , we find that this scenario is quite natural for young massive discs but is less so for older discs , e.g. , those whose self - gravitating phase has terminated a fraction of a million year or more ago . </S>",
    "<S> this stems from the fact that td protoplanets of such an age should have contracted significantly , and so are unlikely to loose much mass . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that either ( i ) the population of `` transition discs '' with large holes and dust - poor accretion is much younger than generally believed ; or ( ii ) there is a poorly understood stage for late removal of dust - poor envelopes from td planets ; ( iii ) another explanation for the observations is correct .    </S>",
