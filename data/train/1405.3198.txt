    "<S> the first two are directly obtained from a gel of @xmath54 pa at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the third one is obtained after cooling sample of fig.[fig : module]-(f , g ) upside down from 50 degrees down to room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the shear modulus correspondingly decreases from @xmath55 pa to @xmath56 pa . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling takes place gradually from the boundaries towards the center of the sample , resulting in shear modulus gradients until thermal equilibrium is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the dramatic difference between the observed patterns highlights the existence of several equilibrium configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this must be related to a complicated energy landscape with several local minima far from the instability threshold , providing a particularly interesting challenge for non linear physics and morphogenesis . somehow </S>",
    "<S> the notion of instability as introducing a kind of free choice in the evolution of a system shows up here . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the ultimate state reached after such an instability depends not only on the growth of the unstable structure itself but also on uncontrollable or at least hard to control small effects , like various inhomogeneities in space and time . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly evidenced in our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> + we have shown that rti exists in real elastic solids and that it can be observed in everyday s gravity field in soft hydrogels . </S>",
    "<S> the instability threshold depends on the shear modulus , the thickness and the density of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental set - up with soft elastic gels has enabled a quantitative comparison with a linear theory . </S>",
    "<S> this has allowed us to identify the basic ingredients of this instability and the way it appears . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the dispersion relation of surface waves can be a mean to detect the proximity of the threshold , and therefore to predict an impending change .    </S>",
    "<S> these results open the way for further fundamental studies , for instance concerning the dynamic formation and the large - scale organization of the patterns , which are both of great importance for non linear physics and morphogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> rti in solids should also be found in more complex situations , such as biology , geology and industrial processing , with visco - plastic , visco - elastic or non - isotropic materials . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the instability is expected to occur in more extreme conditions ( high accelerations , strong and non - uniform gravitational fields ) where the direct observation is hardly possible . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that our work lays foundation to address such more complex cases . </S>",
