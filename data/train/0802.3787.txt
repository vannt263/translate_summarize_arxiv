    "interstellar dust ( isd ) became a topic of astrophysical research in the early 1930s when the existence of extinction , weakening , and scattering of starlight in the interstellar medium ( ism ) was realised . at that time",
    ", astronomical observations provided the only information about the properties of the dust in the ism . with the advent of dust detectors onboard spacecraft , it became possible to investigate dust particles in - situ .",
    "about 30 years ago , analysis of the data obtained with the dust instruments flown on a couple of spacecraft suggested that isd grains can cross the heliospheric boundary and penetrate deeply into the heliosphere @xcite . in the 1990s , this was undoubtedly demonstrated with the dust instrument carried by the ulysses spacecraft : the ulysses dust detector , which measures mass , speed and approach direction of the impacting grains , identified isd grains with radius above 0.1@xmath4 sweeping through the heliosphere @xcite .     our galactic environment within 500  pc of the sun .",
    "currently , the sun is passing through the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) , shown in violet , which is flowing away from the scorpius - centaurus association of young stars .",
    "the lic resides in a low - density hole in the interstellar medium called the local bubble , shown in black .",
    "nearby , high - density molecular clouds including the aquila rift surround star forming regions , each shown in orange .",
    "the gum nebula , shown in green , is a region of hot ionized hydrogen gas . inside the gum nebula",
    "is the vela supernova remnant , shown in pink , which is expanding to create fragmented shells of material like the lic ( from p.c .",
    "frisch , university of chicago ) .",
    "]    the galactic environment of our solar system on a larger scale is shown in figure  [ frisch ] .",
    "the nearby interstellar medium ( within about 3  pc of the sun ) is dominated by a shell of material , the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) .",
    "the solar system currently passes through the lic which is located at the edge of the local bubble .",
    "the local bubble was excavated by supernova explosions in the neighbouring starforming regions of the scorpius - centaurus and orion associations .",
    "the solar system emerged from the interior of this bubble within the last @xmath5 years .",
    "the only direct observation of isd close to the sun is weak polarization observed along the sightline towards 36 oph ( distance about 6  pc ) which is due to magnetically aligned dust grains @xcite .",
    "therefore , in - situ sampling of dust from the lic can greatly improve our understanding of the nature and processing of dust in various galactic environments and can cast new light on the chemical composition and homogeneity of the interstellar medium .",
    "in this paper we review the results from in - situ isd measurements obtained with the ulysses and other space - borne dust detectors .",
    "we review our current knowledge about isd inside the heliosphere and in our local interstellar environment .",
    "the ulysses in - situ dust measurements showed that the grain motion through the solar system is parallel to the flow of neutral interstellar hydrogen and helium gas , both gas and dust travelling with a speed of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the upstream direction of the dust flow lies at @xmath7 ecliptic longitude and @xmath8 latitude @xcite .",
    "the interstellar dust flow persists at high ecliptic latitudes above and below the ecliptic plane and even over the poles of the sun , whereas interplanetary dust is strongly depleted at high latitudes @xcite .",
    "the interstellar dust flux measured at a distance of about 3  au from the sun is time - dependent , and the mean mass of the grains is about @xmath9 @xcite , corresponding to a grain radius of approximately 0.3 @xmath4 .",
    "measurements with the identical dust instrument onboard galileo performed in the ecliptic plane showed that beyond about 3  au the interstellar dust flux even exceeds the flux of micron - sized interplanetary grains .",
    "results from the first decade of the ulysses mission showed that the radii of clearly identified interstellar grains range from 0.05@xmath4 to above 1@xmath4 .",
    "the data show distance - dependent alteration of the interstellar dust stream caused by gravitational focussing by the sun , solar radiation pressure , and electromagnetic interaction with the time - varying interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiation pressure and electromagnetic forces strongly depend on grain size , leading to a strong modification of the size distribution and fluxes of grains measured inside the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "the size distribution shows a deficiency of small grains below 0.3@xmath4 compared to astronomically observed isd @xcite .",
    "in addition , solar radiation pressure deflects grains with sizes of about 0.4@xmath4 and was found to be effective at solar distances below 4  au @xcite .",
    "significant differences in the particle sizes were also recorded at different heliocentric distances .",
    "in addition to the ulysses measurements which revealed a lack of small 0.3@xmath4 isd grains within 3  au heliocentric distance , measurements by cassini and galileo in the distance range between 0.7 and 3  au showed that the detected interstellar particles were bigger than 0.5@xmath4 , with grain masses increasing closer to the sun @xcite .",
    "the flux of these bigger particles did not exhibit temporal variations due to the solar - wind magnetic field like the flux of smaller particles observed by ulysses .",
    "the trend of increasing particle masses continues even closer to the sun , as demonstrated by helios which recorded particles of about 1@xmath4 down to 0.3  au @xcite .",
    "these facts support the idea that the isd stream is strongly filtered by solar radiation pressure .",
    "interstellar particles with optical properties of astronomical silicates or organic refractory materials are consistent with the observed radiation pressure effects @xcite .",
    "in addition to studies of the distribution of grain masses , the ulysses dust instrument monitors the flux of the interstellar particles in the heliosphere ( figure  [ fig_fit ] ) . in mid 1996 , we observed a decrease of the interstellar dust flux by a factor of 3 from an initial value of @xmath10 down to @xmath11 .",
    "this drop was attributed to increased filtering of small grains by the solar wind driven imf during solar minimum conditions @xcite . since early 2000",
    ", ulysses has again detected interstellar dust flux levels above @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of the grain dynamics in the heliosphere showed that the dominant contribution to the dust flux comes from grains with a charge - to - mass ratio of @xmath13 and a radiation pressure efficiency of @xmath14 , corresponding to grain radii of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "particles even bigger ( 40@xmath4 ) than the grains measured in - situ with the spacecraft detectors were reliably identified by meteor radar observations @xcite .",
    "the grains were identified by their hyperbolic speeds , and their flow direction varies over a much wider angular range than that of the much smaller grains observed by spacecraft .",
    "@xcite identified a general background influx of extra - solar system particles from southern ecliptic latitudes with enhanced fluxes from discrete sources .",
    "more sensitive meteor observations with the arecibo radar found micron - sized interstellar meteor particles radiating from the direction of the geminga pulsar @xcite . this is particularly interesting because the supernova that formed the geminga pulsar is a potential candidate which may have created the local bubble .",
    "ulysses has monitored the interstellar dust flow through the solar system for more than 15 years now .",
    "this time period covers more than two and a half revolutions of the spacecraft about the sun through more than 2/3 of a complete 22-year solar cycle .",
    "thus , ulysses measured interstellar dust during solar minimum and solar maximum conditions of the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) .",
    "the interstellar dust flux modulation due to grain interaction with the rather undisturbed magnetic field during solar minimum could be well explained @xcite .",
    "the consideration of sensor side wall effects lead to an improved flux determination @xcite .    until early 2005",
    "the approach direction of the interstellar grains was in agreement with the interstellar helium flow direction @xcite .",
    "an example is shown in the left panel of figure  [ rot ] which shows the impact direction of the interstellar impactors in the period from 1996 to 2000 .",
    "six years later , when ulysses was travelling through almost the same spatial region and had an almost identical detection geometry for interstellar grains , the situation was vastly different : first , the range in approach directions of the grains was somewhat wider ( best seen in 2004 ; right panel of figure  [ rot ] ; see also @xcite ) ; second , and more noticeable , in 2005/06 the approach direction of the majority of grains was shifted away from the helium flow direction .",
    "preliminary analysis indicates that this shift is about @xmath16 away from the ecliptic plane towards southern ecliptic latitudes @xcite . at the moment",
    ", we do not know whether it is a temporary shift limited to the time period stated above or whether it continues to the present time .",
    "furthermore , the reason for this shift remains mysterious .",
    "whether it is connected to a secondary stream of interstellar neutral atoms shifted from the main neutral gas flow @xcite is presently unclear .",
    "given , however , that the neutral gas stream is shifted along the ecliptic plane while the shift in the dust flow is offset from the ecliptic , a connection between both phenomena seems unlikely .",
    "even though ulysses position in the heliosphere and the dust detection conditions were very similar during both time intervals considered in figure  [ rot ] , the configurations of the solar wind driven interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) , which strongly affects the dynamics of the smallest grains , were completely different .",
    "we have to consider that the interstellar grains need approximately twenty years to travel from the heliospheric boundary to the inner solar system where they are detected by ulysses .",
    "thus , the effect of the imf on the grain dynamics is the accumulated effect caused by the interaction with the imf over several years : in the earlier time interval ( 1997 - 1999 ) the grains had a recent dynamic history dominated by solar minimum conditions @xcite , while the grains detected during the second interval ( 2002 - 2005 ) had a recent history dominated by the much more disturbed solar maximum conditions of the imf . during the solar maximum conditions the overall magnetic dipole field changed polarity .",
    "@xcite predicted that due to this effect in a 22-year cycle , small interstellar grains experience either focussing or defocusing conditions . during these times",
    "they are systematically deflected by the solar wind magnetic field either towards or away from the solar magnetic equator plane ( close to the ecliptic plane ) .",
    "this latter configuration likely has a strong influence on the dust dynamics and the total interstellar flux in the inner heliosphere but it is not modelled in detail in the presently existing models .",
    "an explanation of the grain interaction with the imf at the recent solar maximum conditions is still pending .    the fact that the models fit the flux variation by assuming a constant dust concentration in the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) implies that the dust phase of the lic must be homogeneously distributed over length scales of @xmath17 , which is the distance inside the lic travelled by the sun during the measurement period of ulysses from end 1992 to end 2002 @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the more recent ulysses data until the end of 2004 @xcite .",
    "the 2005/06 data , on the other hand , put a question mark onto this conclusion because if the observed shift in impact direction turns out to be intrinsic , it would imply that this homogeneity breaks down on larger length scales .",
    "isd grains carry information about their past dynamics outside the heliosphere and are thus of strong interest to understand the dynamical processes in the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) .",
    "they provide the main reservoir and transport mechanism of heavy elements in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the grains is crucial for understanding of nucleation , growth and collisional destruction processes @xcite .",
    "these processes strongly depend on the relative velocities of the grains .",
    "the most important phenomena responsible for the spread of velocities in the lic are gas drag , interaction with the local interstellar magnetic field , radiation pressure and photoelectric emission @xcite .",
    "the relative strengths of the different forces strongly depend on the size and the charge of the grains , together with local conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , like gas or magnetic field turbulences .",
    "observations of interstellar material ( ism ) towards nearby stars and inside of the solar system , combined with radiative transfer models , give a self - consistent description of the lic @xcite .",
    "the main characteristics of the lic are : atomic neutral hydrogen density @xmath18 , electron and ion density @xmath19 , temperature @xmath20 , and a relative sun - cloud velocity @xmath21 .",
    "the physical conditions in the lic are those of the intercloud medium  warm , low density , partially ionized gas .",
    "an enhancement of refractory elements ( such as fe , mg , mn ) in lic gas , compared to cool interstellar clouds , points to the destruction of interstellar dust grains by interstellar shocks ( velocity 100 to 200 km s@xmath22 ) @xcite .",
    "the ism within 10 pc of the sun is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "at least 5 distinct cloudlets are found within 5 pc of the sun , with differing compositions and physical properties .",
    "temperatures range from 5,400 k ( towards @xmath23 cen ) to 10,000 k ( blue cloud towards @xmath24 cma ) and total densities from @xmath25 ( blue cloud towards @xmath24 cma ) to possibly @xmath26 ( g - cloud towards @xmath23 cen , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gas - phase abundance of fe , with respect to undepleted s , varies by @xmath2750% within 3 pc of the sun , evidently due to grain destruction processes @xcite .",
    "if the ism is chemically homogeneous , elements absent from the gas phase must be depleted onto dust grains .",
    "this argument can be used to evaluate the gas - to - dust mass ratio over the integrated lic column , and can be compared with that of other nearby interstellar clouds .",
    "however , the required knowledge of the total chemical composition of the ism is an elusive quantity that has not been reliably determined .",
    "a 40%50% variation in / and / for the two clouds towards @xmath24 cma indicates different grain histories for two similar clouds within 3 pc of each other .",
    "if atoms not observed in the gas are concentrated in the dust , can be calculated from observations of interstellar absorption lines towards nearby stars . when evidence for 60%70% subsolar abundances is included , @xmath27600 integrated over the diameter of the lic @xcite .",
    "gas - to - dust mass ratios calculated from more recent models with improved solar abundances are in the range @xmath27140490 , again depending on solar abundances @xcite .",
    "interestingly , determined from comparisons of the ulysses in - situ measurements inside of the solar system , compared to gas densities from these models , yield = 116127 @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasised that the obtained from the in - situ measurements is an upper limit , since the smallest interstellar dust grains ( radii 0.1 @xmath4 ) are prevented from entering the heliosphere .",
    "overall , the in - situ value is a factor of @xmath2 2 larger than the one derived from astronomical observations , indicating a relative concentration of interstellar dust in the ism close to the sun compared to the @xmath270.5 pc lic cloud length towards @xmath24 cma .",
    "the gas - to - dust mass ratio also varies by more than 30% over the nearest 3 pc .",
    "if ism abundances are solar , the in - situ and astronomical methods of determining are  generally  in better agreement , but interstellar absorption line data towards weakly reddened stars remain unexplained .",
    "these differences are not yet understood .",
    "the chemical composition of interstellar dust grains observed within the solar system thus provides a window on the chemical composition and homogeneity of the ism .",
    "the combination of absorption line data toward @xmath24 cma and the modelled photoionization also lead to the conclusion that the lic has a very interesting pattern of gas phase elemental abundances @xcite : c appears to be substantially supersolar while fe , mg and si are subsolar .",
    "o and n are close to solar .",
    "this indicates that carbonaceous grains have been destroyed in the lic while silicate grains have survived .",
    "the extra c in the gas has not been explained but may be evidence for a local enhancement of carbonaceous dust followed by grain destruction in a shock .",
    "the masses of interstellar grains measured in - situ with the spacecraft detectors range from @xmath28 to above @xmath1 .",
    "if we compare the mass distribution of these interstellar impactors with the dust mass distribution derived from astronomical observations , we find that the in - situ measurements overlap only with the largest masses observed astronomically .",
    "this is further supported by the radar measurements which revealed even bigger grains .",
    "these measurements imply that the intrinsic size distribution of interstellar grains in the lic extends to sizes much larger than those grains which are detectable by astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "there are no direct observations of interstellar dust within 5 pc and outside of the solar system .",
    "the observations of very weak starlight polarization towards nearby stars ( @xmath2940 pc ) may originate from magnetically aligned dust grains close to the solar system .",
    "the observed polarization strength is consistent with the average interstellar density of @xmath30 over tens of parsecs in the upwind direction @xcite .",
    "the in - situ grains have a size distribution consistent with these classical dust grains .",
    "interstellar gas and dust couple through collisional processes , and through coupling of ions and charged grains to the interstellar magnetic field . over distance scales of 100500 pc , gas - dust coupling is demonstrated through the correlation of starlight - reddening dust grains ( measured as color excess e(b - v ) ) and interstellar hydrogen ( + 22 ) @xcite .",
    "for the multicloud structure observed within 5 pc , gas - dust coupling is not proven . the collisional lifetimes for classical dust grains ( radii @xmath31 m ) in the lic are @xmath32 years , during which time the lic will move @xmath275 pc through local space .",
    "the gyroradius is @xmath270.1 pc in a field of 3 @xmath33 g @xcite .",
    "the result will be magnetically captured dust grains that are collisionally destroyed over the lifetime of the cloud .",
    "grn and landgraf ( 2000 ) suggested that the small `` classical '' grains are replenished by the collisional destruction of larger dust grains .",
    "alternatively , silicate grain destruction peaks near shock column densities of @xmath34 @xcite , allowing the breakdown of gas - dust coupling locally over @xmath271 pc length scales .",
    "there are important consequences from the existence of the big particle population in the lic . while particles observed by spacecraft couple to the interstellar medium on length scales of less than 1 pc via electromagnetic interactions , more massive grains couple to the gas over much longer scales of 100 to 1000  pc @xcite . therefore , big interstellar meteor particles travel unaffected over much longer distances and may come directly from their source region .",
    "ulysses is presently in the inner solar system where interstellar grains can not reliably be separated from interplanetary impactors .",
    "after mid-2008 , however , if the ulysses spacecraft remains in good health , the dust instrument will monitor the interstellar grains again .",
    "the ulysses mission is presently planned to be extended until at least early 2009 so that additional dust data will hopefully become available .",
    "a further mission extension until 2011 is technically feasible and may provide interstellar dust data from the outer heliosphere again . with this latter extension",
    "the ulysses measurements would cover an almost entire 22-year solar cycle .",
    "it would make the ulysses data a unique data set of dust measurements from interplanetary space for decades to come .",
    "together with detailed modelling of the grain interaction with the imf during the highly disordered solar maximum conditions we will hopefully be able to reveal the origin of the observed @xmath16 shift .",
    "if the shift turned out to be intrinsic , being potentially connected with a secondary population of interstellar grains , it would put strong constraints on the small - scale structure of the lic .",
    "this would also be highly relevant for the interpretation of results from the stardust mission which recently brought a sample of collected interstellar grains to earth ( a. westphal 2006 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , and for future dust astronomy space missions aiming at the in - situ analysis and sample return of interstellar dust ( cosmicdune , sarim ; * ? ? ?",
