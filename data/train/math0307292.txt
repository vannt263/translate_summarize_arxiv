    "it follows that in the resulting bijection between @xmath0-parking functions and spanning trees , @xmath0-parking functions with the same sum of values are mapped to spanning trees with the same number of externally active edges .    to show that the bijections presented in this paper are substantially different from the ones in @xcite , consider the case @xmath30 , and",
    "let @xmath240 be the path obtained as follows : start at the root vertex @xmath11 , and then append the remaining vertices one by one , so that at each step the appended edge is the smallest , in the chosen edge order , among all edges that can possibly be appended .",
    "there are no externally active edges with respect to @xmath240 since every edge @xmath25 not in @xmath240 , where @xmath7 is closer to the root in @xmath240 than @xmath15 , is greater than the edge @xmath317 , where @xmath318 is the vertex appended after @xmath7 in the construction of @xmath240 , by choice of @xmath318 . on the other hand ,",
    "if a path @xmath319 does not include the smallest edge in the chosen edge order , then this edge is externally active with respect to @xmath319 .",
    "hence there is a different number of externally active edges with respect to @xmath240 and @xmath319 .",
    "however , every bijection @xmath57 maps both @xmath240 and @xmath319 to permutations of @xmath320 , so the sum of values of the corresponding @xmath0-parking functions is the same .",
    "hence for @xmath30 , none of the bijections @xmath57 coincides with a bijection from the family constructed in @xcite .",
    "dhar defined the _ burning algorithm _ for determining whether a given configuration is allowed ; see @xcite .",
    "in our setting this task corresponds to the question whether a function @xmath321 is a @xmath0-parking function , and an equivalent formulation of dhar s burning algorithm is the following .",
    "we mark vertices of the graph , starting with the root @xmath11 . at each iteration of the algorithm , we mark all vertices @xmath322 that have more marked neighbors than the value of the function at @xmath322 . if in the end all vertices are marked , then we have a @xmath0-parking function , as it is not hard to see directly from definition .",
    "conversely , for every @xmath0-parking function , this algorithm marks all vertices .",
    "we claim that our bijection corresponding to the breadth first search order @xmath323 is a natural generalization of dhar s algorithm . given a parking function @xmath324 ,",
    "perform the construction of @xmath325 as described above .",
    "we know that @xmath29 contains all verices if and only if we started with a @xmath0-parking function .",
    "let us group the vertices of @xmath29 by height , setting @xmath326 to be the set of vertices of @xmath29 of height @xmath15 .",
    "[ burningbreadthfirst ] @xmath326 is exactly the set of vertices marked at the @xmath15-th step of the burning algorithm .    for @xmath327",
    "the claim is true because the root @xmath11 is marked at the @xmath11-th step .",
    "we prove the claim by induction .",
    "suppose that for @xmath328 , the vertices in @xmath329 are marked at the @xmath155-th step of the dhar s algorithm .",
    "let @xmath330 be the edge going out of @xmath7 in @xmath29 .",
    "each vertex @xmath331 has more than @xmath6 edges going to vertices not larger than @xmath332 in @xmath323 order .",
    "all vertices not larger than @xmath332 are in @xmath333 since @xmath334 .",
    "therefore , all vertices in @xmath326 are marked at the @xmath15-th step of dhar s algorithm .",
    "on the other hand , every vertex marked at the @xmath15-th step of the algorithm in our is to be attached in @xmath29 to a vertex from @xmath333 since we add vertices to @xmath29 in the order @xmath323 .",
    "thus each such vertex is in @xmath326 .",
    "hence dhar s burning algorithm is realized by our bijection for the breadth first search tree order .",
