    "this galaxy was selected because of its blue color and visually estimated compact non - stellar appearance and faint apparent magnitude .",

    "follow - up observations ( koo et al . 2005 , in preparation ) with keck hires @xcite also show that the emission lines have gaussian velocity dispersions of @xmath2 27 km / s .",

    "these properties from koo et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) and summarized in table  [ props ] , strongly suggest that sa 68 - 6597 is a blue compact dwarf that is fainter and smaller than other bcds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the  content of sa 68 - 6597 is an important measure of its potential for future star formation .",
    "the current burst of star formation is small in an absolute sense , 0.003 @xmath12  yr@xmath6 , but if the  mass is also low then it can still rapidly consume its  and subsequently passively evolve , fade and possibly become a galaxy like the carina dwarf spheroidal in the local group .",
    "if the  mass is much higher , then it is more likely to continue forming stars for a long time and will retain its current appearance . furthermore , while the optical emission lines have a width of 27 kms@xmath6 , this linewidth may not trace the entire gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "the  gas tends to trace the gravitational potential to larger radii than the stars or ionized gas . in addition",
    ", ionized gas may be tracing galactic outflows ; this is less likely for the neutral gas . for all of these reasons ,  provides the best measure of the total , dynamical mass of a galaxy .",
    "the dynamical mass is an important constraint on the evolution of a galaxy .",

    "in this paper , we report on our arecibo observations of  in sa 68 - 6597 .",
    "these observations help constrain the potential for future star formation in the galaxy and provide a more robust measure of the total mass of the galaxy constraining the current nature and future evolution of sa 68 - 6597 , and its relation to other bcds like i zw 18 .",
    "we observed sa 68 - 6597 with the arecibo 305 m telescope on 2004 august 14 and october 34 .",

    "both values are weakly dependent on the zenith angle of the observation .",
    "data were processed through the interim correlator in both linear polarizations over total bandwidths of 25 mhz and 12.5 mhz , corresponding to a velocity range of @xmath25000 kms@xmath6  and @xmath22500  kms@xmath6 . each bandwidth and polarization had 9-level sampling and 2048 channels , resulting in a velocity resolution per channel of 5.2 kms@xmath6  and 2.6 kms@xmath6 .",
    "our observations utilized a high pass filter to block interference below 1370 mhz contaminating our band .",
    "the beam size of the l - wide receiver according to the arecibo documentation is 3.1@xmath31 3.5@xmath32 . at the distance of sa 68 - 6597 , 80 mpc",
    ", this corresponds to a linear size of 72 kpc@xmath10 81 kpc .",
    "as the effective radius of the stellar emission is only 190 pc , this should be more than sufficient to encompass all of the associated with this galaxy . yet",
    "this beam size is small enough that there are no known galaxies at a similar redshift that can contaminate our  measurements ; the closest galaxy is @xmath15400 kpc away and there are no known groups within 3 mpc based on a ned search .",
    "it is further unlikely that there are any -rich , optically invisible galaxies exist that could contaminate our measurements @xcite .",
    "we used the standard position switching algorithm for our observations spending 5 minutes on sa 68 - 6597 followed by 5 minutes offset to blank sky by 5 minutes in right ascension such that we tracked the same azimuth and zenith angle as the on - source scan .",
    "this was repeated for all six nights for an on - source integration time of 240 minutes .",
    "our data were reduced using standard arecibo idl routines written by phil perrilat .",
    "each bandwidth of each scan was calibrated separately and the polarizations were averaged together before a first or second order baseline was fit across the portion of the spectrum clean of any interference .",
    "all scans were then averaged together to produce the final spectrum .",
    "while some scans showed signatures of interference around 1400 mhz , since sa 68 - 6597 is at a frequency of 1394 mhz this should not affect our ability to detect the galaxy .",
    "the bandpass , however , was significantly better for the 12.5 mhz band as a result of the rfi at 1400 mhz , and so we proceeded only with this band . because the two bands are split after the first amplification ,",
    "their noise is not independent and , therefore , it would not have helped to combine these bands .",
    "the resulting noise was 0.22 mjy per 2.6 kms@xmath6channel . for analysis , we binned this spectrum by 4 channels to a resolution of 10.8 kms@xmath6 , improving the noise to 0.10 mjy per channel .",

''",
    "our derived gas depletion timescale , @xmath38 , for sa 68 - 6597 is 5@xmath92 gyr .",
    "this value provides a rough measure of the time it will take for sa 68 - 6597 to consume all of its gas at its current rate of star formation @xcite .",

    "the results of @xcite are based on a dark matter halo approximately 10 - 100@xmath51 larger than the gas mass .",

    "the large @xmath14of sa 68 - 6597 implies that if and when it consumes all its gas , it may be able to evolve into a moderate mass analog of the local group dwarf spheroidals @xcite .",

    "such outflows could result in partial blowout of the ism in the galaxy of anywhere between @xmath191% to 100% @xcite potentially reducing the gas depletion time .",
    "outflows can also be particularly efficient at ejecting metals into the intergalactic medium @xcite permitting a galaxy like sa 68 - 6597 to form many generations of stars while maintaining its very low metallicity .",
    "clearly more sensitive and detailed  observations are needed to address this issue .",
    "we have observed the recently discovered blue compact dwarf galaxy , sa 68 - 6597 , with the arecibo telescope to determine its gas content and better constrain its total mass using the  line .",
    "sa 68 - 6597 is one of the faintest , lowest metallicity bcds known .",
    "sa 68 - 6597 has properties which indicate it is a typical blue compact dwarf galaxy in all ways , except for its extremely low luminosity and small  and dynamical masses . in this way it represents the faint , low mass tail of the distribution of bcd properties .",

    "sa 68 - 6597 s gas depletion timescale is similar to the value for other bcds and normal field galaxies , yet is shorter than most dwarf irregulars in the local group . nevertheless , sa 68 - 6597 can continue to form stars at its current , prolific rate for almost 5 gyr and would , therefore , be unlikely to fade significantly in that time .",
    "when it does fade , its relatively large dynamical mass suggests it may be able to evolve into a massive dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "its future evolutionary path remains murky .    because of the combination of the distance and low  mass of sa 68 - 6597 , our detection was only at the 3@xmath36 level , meaning that the measured linewidth and derived dynamical mass are poorly constrained .",
    "nevertheless , the most probable value of the linewidth is less than the measured h@xmath4 linewidth indicating that galactic outflows may be present in sa 68 - 6597 . because of the potential implications of such a situation on sa 68 - 6597 s evolution , more sensitive , spatially resolved  observations of sa 68 - 6597 are essential to unravel its current nature and reveal its evolutionary path .",
