    "large - scale coherent structures in a non - rotating turbulent convection at very large rayleigh numbers are observed in the atmospheric convective boundary layers @xcite , in numerous laboratory experiments in the rayleigh - bnard apparatus @xcite and in direct numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "spatial scales of the large - scale coherent structures in a turbulent convection are much larger than turbulent scales and their life - time is larger than the largest time scales of turbulence . in the atmospheric shear - free convection , the structures ( cloud cells ) represent large , three - dimensional , long - lived bnard - type cells composed of narrow uprising plumes and wide downdraughts .",
    "they usually embrace the entire convective boundary layer ( of the order of 1 - 3 km in height ) and include pronounced convergence flow patterns close to the surface . in the sheared convective flows ,",
    "the structures represent large - scale rolls ( cloud streets ) stretched along the mean wind @xcite .",
    "coherent structures in convective turbulent flows were comprehensively studied theoretically , experimentally and in numerical simulations @xcite . however , some aspects related to the origin of large - scale coherent structures in non - rotating turbulent convection are not completely understood .",
    "hartlep et al .",
    "( 2003 ) noted that there are two points of view on the origin of large - scale circulation in turbulent convection @xcite .",
    "according to one point of view , the rolls which develop at low rayleigh numbers near the onset of convection continually increase their size as rayleigh number is increased and continue to exist in an average sense at even the highest rayleigh numbers reached in the experiments @xcite .",
    "another hypothesis holds that the large - scale circulation is a genuine high rayleigh number effect @xcite .",
    "recently , a new mean - field theory of non - rotating turbulent convection has been developed @xcite .",
    "this theory predicts the convective - wind instability in the shear - free turbulent convection that results in the formation of large - scale motions in the form of cells . in the sheared convection ,",
    "the large - scale instability causes generation of convective - shear waves .",
    "the dominant coherent structures in this case are rolls .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that a redistribution of the turbulent heat flux due to non - uniform large - scale motions plays a crucial role in the formation of the large - scale coherent structures in turbulent convection .    in this",
    "study a theoretical approach @xcite is developed further to investigate the formation of the coherent structures in the non - rotating turbulent convection . in particular , we investigated how the modification of the turbulent heat flux due to non - uniform large - scale motions affects the critical rayleigh number ( based on the eddy viscosity and turbulent thermal conductivity ) required for the excitation of the convective - wind instability .",
    "we performed numerical study of the convective - wind and convective - shear instabilities in order to determine key parameters that affect formation of the large - scale coherent structures in the turbulent convection .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discussed the physics of the formation of the large - scale coherent structures and formulated the mean - field equations which describe the formation of the coherent structures . in section",
    "iii we determined the critical rayleigh number required for the excitation of the convective - wind instability in a shear - free turbulent convection . in section",
    "iv we studied numerically the convective - shear instability in a sheared convection .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section  v.",
    "in this section we discuss a redistribution of the turbulent heat flux due to the non - uniform large - scale motions as a key mechanism for the formation of the large - scale coherent structures in turbulent convection . here",
    "we also formulate the mean - field equations which describe the formation of the coherent structures .",
    "traditional theoretical models of the boundary - layer turbulence , such as the kolmogorov - type local closures , imply the following assumptions .",
    "fluid flows are decomposed into organized mean motions and turbulent flow .",
    "turbulent fluxes are assumed to be proportional to the local mean gradients , whereas the proportionality coefficients ( eddy viscosity , turbulent temperature diffusivity ) are uniquely determined by local turbulent parameters .",
    "for example @xcite , the turbulent heat flux reads @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the turbulent temperature diffusivity , @xmath2 is the mean entropy , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are fluctuations of the velocity and entropy , respectively .",
    "this turbulent heat flux @xmath5 does not include the contribution from anisotropic velocity fluctuations .",
    "actually the mean velocity gradients can directly affect the turbulent heat flux .",
    "the reason is that additional essentially anisotropic velocity fluctuations are generated by tangling the mean - velocity gradients with the kolmogorov - type turbulence due to the influence of the inertial forces during the life time of large turbulent eddies .",
    "the kolmogorov - type turbulence supplies energy to the anisotropic velocity fluctuations which cause formation of coherent structures due to the excitation of a large - scale instability @xcite .",
    "anisotropic velocity fluctuations are characterized by a steeper spectrum than the kolmogorov - type turbulence @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model @xcite of the anisotropic velocity fluctuations and their effect on the turbulent heat flux includes the following steps in the derivations : applying the spectral closure , solving the equations for the second moments in the @xmath6 space , and returning to the physical space to obtain formulas for the reynolds stresses and the turbulent heat flux . the derivation are based on the navier - stokes equation and the entropy evolution equation formulated in the boussinesq approximation .",
