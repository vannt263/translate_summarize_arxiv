    "in this work , we study the @xmath8-excited random walk in one dimension .",
    "this recently - introduced model @xcite , gives rise to a stochastic process with many unusual properties @xcite .",
    "the definition of the excited random walk is as follows : initially each site of a one - dimensional chain contains a fixed number of cookies @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) .",
    "a random walk makes nearest - neighbor hops between sites on the chain , with hopping probabilities that depend on whether or not the current site contains a cookie .",
    "when the walker hops onto a site that contains one or more cookies , the walker eats a cookie and , at the next time step , the walk hops to the right with probability @xmath10 and to the left with probability @xmath1 . if the walker hops onto an empty site , then the hopping probabilities to the left and right at the next step are both 1/2 .",
    "this bias can be viewed as the foraging strategy of a primitive organism .",
    "when it encounters food , the organism consumes the food and continues to move in a preferred direction .",
    "conversely , the organism wanders aimlessly when it does not encounter any food .     and",
    "@xmath11 are shown as thick and dashed lines , while steps occurring with probability 1/2 are shown as thin lines .",

    "for the half - line system , the last cookie at @xmath12 is first hit after 10 time steps.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ]    a basic feature of the excited random walk is the transitory nature of the bias ; that is , when all the cookies at a given site are eaten the subsequent motion is unbiased .",
    "this non - markovian feature is responsible for the unusual properties of the excited random walk .",
    "related non - markovian constraints arise in many important stochastic phenomena .",
    "perhaps the best known example is the self - avoiding random walk , where returns to previously - visited sites are strictly forbidden @xcite .",
    "this leads to an expansion , relative to the pure random walk , in which the root - mean - square displacement grows faster than @xmath13 when the spatial dimension is less than 4 .",
    "a related example is the `` true '' self - avoiding walk , where returns to previously - visited sites are inhibited by an energetic constraint @xcite .",
    "the opposite type of perturbation occurs in the reinforced random walk @xcite , where the walk has a preference to hop onto previously - visited sites .",
    "depending of the functional form of this reinforcement , the walk may , quite surprisingly , `` condense '' onto a support that consists of only a finite number of sites as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the excited random walk represents a simple and surprisingly rich example of a non - markovian process in which the bias at each site disappears when all the cookies on the site are eaten . because a random walk in one dimension is recurrent , that is , the probability to eventually return to the starting point equals one , the walk returns to previously - visited sites infinitely often . for the 1-excited walk , the reinforcement mechanism due to",
    "the presence of cookies is insufficient to counterbalance this recurrence of the random walk ; thus the 1-excited random walk remains recurrent for any @xmath15 .",
    "nevertheless , this model exhibits many novel features .",
    "for example , the probability that a 1-excited walk on an infinite line first returns to the origin at time @xmath2 decays as @xmath3 , rather than the @xmath16 decay for a pure random walk @xcite .    on the other hand , the @xmath8-excited random walk with @xmath17",
    "is more strongly influenced by the cookie - induced bias .",
    "in fact , for @xmath18 , the @xmath8-excited random walk becomes transient @xcite .",
    "this transition has dramatic consequences on the statistical properties of the walk as @xmath0 is varied . as a final introductory point",
    ", the excited random walk appears to be most interesting in one dimension because of the non - trivial competition between the reinforcement when a cookie is eaten and the fact that encounters with sites that contain cookies become progressively less frequent . in contrast , an unbiased random walk in greater than one dimension typically encounters previously - unvisited sites @xcite . because each such site contains a cookie , the reinforcement mechanism acts as a non - zero global bias that is superimposed on the random walk motion .",
    "thus the asymptotic behavior of an excited walk in higher dimensions is close to that of a simple biased random walk .    in the next section ,",
    "we begin by recounting some basic first - passage properties for diffusion in a finite interval @xcite .",
    "we present these results separately because they underlie our analytical treatment of excited random walks . in sec .",
    "iii , we study a particularly simple version of the excited random walk ",
    "the 1-excited walk with a reflecting boundary condition at the origin .",
    "we use basic tools of first - passage processes to determine the time dependence of the size of the region in which the cookies have been eaten and thence the probability for the walk to first return to the origin .",
    "the long - time behavior of the first - passage probability in a closely related model was obtained previously , using quite different methods , in @xcite .",
    "our approach is also complementary to the tools employed in the probabilistic studies of excited random walks given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "iv , we first present numerical simulations for the unusual properties for the probability distribution and for the span of the 1-excited random walk on the infinite line .",
    "we also construct a probabilistic argument to quantify the asymmetry in the number of cookies eaten from the left and right sides of the line . finally , in sec .",
    "v we present several intriguing properties of the 2-excited walk on the infinite line , including the lack of scaling in the probability distribution , the time for the 2-excited walk to traverse a finite domain , and basic features of the cookie density profile that is left behind as the walk advances .",
    "to determine the motion of excited random walks , we require the first - passage properties of a nearest - neighbor unbiased random walk , or equivalently , continuum diffusion , in a finite interval @xmath19 $ ] when both boundaries are absorbing .",
    "the first such property is the eventual hitting , or exit , probability to @xmath20 and to @xmath21 for a random walk that starts at @xmath22 within the interval @xcite .",
    "these exit probabilities are : @xmath23 closely related quantities are the conditional exit times to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these are the mean times for the random walk to hit @xmath20 or to hit @xmath21 with the restriction that the other boundary is never hit .",
    "these conditional times are : @xmath24 next , we will also need the laplace transforms of the first - passage probabilities for a random walk that starts at @xmath22 to exit at the left edge and at the right edge of the absorbing interval @xmath19 $ ] at time @xmath2 . in the continuum limit , these first passage probabilities are ( eq .  ( 2.2.10 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath25 where we take the diffusion coefficient to be @xmath26 for the nearest - neighbor random walk",
    ".    we will also need first - passage properties in the interval @xmath19 $ ] when the boundary at @xmath20 is reflecting and the other boundary is absorbing .",
    "we implement the reflecting boundary condition for a discrete random walk that is at site @xmath20 by allowing the walk to remain at @xmath20 with probability 1/2 or by having hop to @xmath27 with probability 1/2 .",
    "this definition for the reflecting boundary has the advantage that it leads to a constant probability density around this boundary for large times . with this definition ,",
    "the average time to exit at the right edge of the interval @xmath19 $ ] as a function of @xmath22 is @xmath28 finally , the laplace transform of the first - passage probability to exit at the right edge at time @xmath2 in the continuum limit is ( eq .  ( 2.2.21 ) in @xcite ) @xmath29    we will exploit these results to now determine various basic features of the 1-excited random walk in one dimension .",
    "there are two basic properties of the excited random walk that we will be able to determine analytically : ( i ) the location of the last ( leftmost ) cookie ; we obtain this property in terms of the first - passage statistics of a 1-excited random walk to the right edge of the cookie - free domain , and ( ii ) the statistics of returns to the origin .",
    "consider the 1-excited random walk that is restricted to the non - negative integers by imposing a reflecting boundary condition at the origin .",
    "initially there is one cookie at each site and the walk is at @xmath30 . at the first time step , the walk either hops to @xmath31 with probability @xmath0 or it remains at site @xmath30 with probability @xmath11 ( fig .  [ def-1 ] ) . at later times , a bias in the random walk motion occurs whenever the walk reaches the right edge of the cookie - free domain .",
    "the restriction of fixing one boundary condition while the other boundary condition `` floats '' greatly simplifies the analytical description of the 1-excited walk on the half - line compared to the infinite line system .",
    "it is useful to characterize the walk by the sequence of times @xmath32 at which the walk hits the leftmost ( last ) cookie at @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ def-1 ] ) .",
    "suppose that the walk has just reached the cookie at @xmath34 .",
    "then with probability @xmath0 , the next step of the walk is to right , which takes one time step , while with probability @xmath11 , the walk steps left to @xmath35 and the last cookie now is at @xmath33 . in this latter case ,",
    "the average time it takes the walk to reach site @xmath33 is @xmath36 [ see eq .",
    "( [ exittime_ref ] ) ] plus the time for the initial step from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "thus the mean time increment for the last cookie to move from @xmath34 to @xmath33 is @xmath37 consequently , the mean time for the walk to hit the last cookie at @xmath33 for the first time is @xmath38 notice that for @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , the early time behavior is governed by ballistic motion , after which there is a crossover at a time of order @xmath41 to the asymptotic diffusive behavior of @xmath42 .",
    "we now extend this analysis to obtain the distribution of first - passage times for the walk to hit the last cookie at @xmath33 at time @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the probability that the time interval between the walk first hitting site @xmath44 and first hitting site @xmath8 equals @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath45 be the first - passage probability that the walk hits site @xmath33 for the first time at time @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",

    "the first step of the walk is accounted for by defining @xmath56 .",
    "we anticipate that the dominant contribution to @xmath48 in the long - time limit comes from terms where @xmath57 @xcite . in this limit , eq .  ( [ qfull ] ) reduces to @xmath58 by expanding @xmath59 of eq .",
