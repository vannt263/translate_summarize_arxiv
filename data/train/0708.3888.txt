    "let us review briefly a mechanism of superconductivity in weakly coupled 1d systems .",
    "a 1d system typically has several types of fluctuating order which coexist with each other ( for example , superconducting and spin or charge density wave orders ) . even though none of these can truly become long - range ordered in the isolated 1d system at generic ( incommensurate ) filling , the susceptibility of the system to these types for order can become large at low temperature . then , treating the inter - chain coupling at the mean - field level , the critical temperature is determined by the stoner criterion : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the inter - chain coupling and @xmath24 is the susceptibility to the type of order considered . assuming that the inter - chain coupling constants of the various types of order are all of comparable size",
    ", the type of order that is most likely to be selected is the one which has the largest ( i.e. most divergent ) susceptibility at low temperature .",
    "a single - component 1d electron system with repulsive interactions can generically be described at low energies as a luttinger liquid with one gapless spin and one gapless charge mode .",
    "such a system is usually a poor superconductor , with a superconducting susceptibility @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the charge luttinger parameter .",
    "since typically @xmath27 , the superconducting susceptibility is non - divergent while the cdw and sdw susceptibilities both diverge .",
    "multi - component 1d systems are more promising in this respect .",
    "the problem of two coupled luttinger liquids has been studied extensively , and it is found to be in a  luther - emery \" phase over a wide range of parameters . in this phase , only the total charge mode remains gapless while all other spin and charge modes are gapped .",
    "it is therefore similar to the phase of a single component system with a spin gap caused by attractive interactions , although the identity of the physical correlation functions in the two systems is somewhat different . if we label the 1d phases as c@xmath28s@xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the numbers of gapless charge and spin modes respectively@xcite , the luther - emery phase is c@xmath5s@xmath32 . since the entire spin sector is gapped , the dominant fluctuations in this system are superconducting fluctuations and @xmath33 cdw fluctuations , with susceptibilities @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "( here , @xmath36 is the total charge mode luttinger parameter . )",
    "near half filling , it has been shown schultzladderlowdope that @xmath37 and therefore superconducting fluctuations always dominate .",
    "the interpretation of superconductivity in pr-247 as deriving from a luther - emery phase was proposed in ref .",
    "an important observation is that in this scenario , the spin gap @xmath38 must be significantly larger than @xmath4 . at temperatures higher than @xmath38 , the spin modes are essentially gapless , and",
    "the exponents controlling the susceptibilities would cross over to new exponents of a gapless phase . in the regime @xmath39  pseudogap \" behavior should be observed : a gap appears in the spectrum , but this gap is not associated with any type of long - range order .",

    "assuming that the relaxation process is mostly due to local magnetic field fluctuations ( rather than electric field gradient fluctuations ) , this implies that there is no spin gap in the zigzag chains .",
    "the @xmath40 signal seems to follow a non - trivial power law as a function of temperature , which implies a power law decay of spin - spin correlations . for a discussion of the interpretation of @xmath40 nmr measurements , see [ ] .",
    "the preceding analysis leads us to the phenomenological idea that the zigzag chain is in a phase with gapless spin excitations .",
    "two uncoupled chains are in a c@xmath41s@xmath41 phase .",
    "inter - chain interactions can gap some of these modes .",
    "for example , we can consider a c@xmath5s@xmath41 or a c@xmath5s@xmath5 phase . in these cases ,",
    "the spin - spin correlations behave as a power law ( since the total spin mode is gapless ) .",
    "however , some of the relative spin and charge modes ( the modes that correspond to fluctuations of the charge of the two chains relative to each other ) are gapped , which can enhance superconducting ( as well as other ) susceptibilities . in the rest of this paper , we will advocate an explanation of superconductivity in pr-247 in terms of such a phase , whose existence will be established in a microscopic model for the zigzag chain .",
    "the most likely candidate phase that emerges from our analysis is what we will call a c@xmath5s@xmath6 phase , in which the relative charge mode and  half \" of the relative spin mode are gapped .",
    "( we give a more precise definition for these terms in appendix [ app : c_1s_1.5 ] . ) the resulting susceptibilities in this phase are @xmath42 note that the superconducting susceptibility is divergent for @xmath43 , and is the dominant one when @xmath44 .",
    "we comment that the proposed c@xmath5s@xmath6 phase is likely not to be a true @xmath45 phase : it will be ultimately unstable to formation of a c@xmath5s@xmath32 phase",
    ". nevertheless , if the gap in the total spin sector is small compared to @xmath4 , the physics above @xmath4 is best described in terms of a c@xmath5s@xmath46 .",
    "such a hierarchy of gaps is found to emerges in the microscopic model that will be studied here ( see section [ sec : dmrg ] ) .",
    "finally , the luttinger exponent @xmath36 that controls the low - energy properties of the system depends on microscopic details , and is therefore difficult to estimate theoretically .",
    "however , since the power with which the spin susceptibility depends on temperature also depends on @xmath36 , it can be extracted from a measurement of this susceptibility .",

    "away from half filling , both the @xmath205 and @xmath206 terms in ( [ h_int_bos ] ) are relevant , and produce a gap in the spectrum .",
    "they both have the same scaling dimension of @xmath207 ( assuming that @xmath208 ) . the system flows to a strong coupling fixed point at which the @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 fields are pinned .",
    "then the only gapless mode is the total charge mode , and the system is in a c@xmath212s@xmath213 phase , similar to the generic situation in the hubbard ladderbalentsfisher .",
    "however , the dmrg  result indicates that while there is a substantial gap in the relative charge mode , the gap in the total spin sector is either zero or very small ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg_gaps ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy is likely to be caused by less relevant ( sub - leading ) operators , not included in eq .",
    "( [ h_int_bos ] ) , whose bare coefficients are of order unity ( since we are not initially at weak coupling ) . the neglect of these operators in the initial stages of the rg transformation is a quantitatively unreliable approximation . taking the dmrg",
    "result into account , we _",
    "hypothesize _ that the effective value of @xmath206 _ at the fixed point _ is close to 0 ( since non - zero @xmath206 is what induces a full spin - gap ) .",
    "if this is true , then over a broad intermediate range of energies , the system is governed by the unstable fixed point with @xmath214 and non - zero @xmath205 .",
    "we would like to stress that the smallness of the spin gap is not a result of fine tuning , but rather appears ( from the numerics ) to be a ubiquitous property of the model .",
    "( the same result is obtained over a range of different parameters and doping levels . ) in contrast , if the inter - chain coupling @xmath77 is artificially turned to be antiferromagnetic , a spin gap appears in the numerical simulation .",
    "therefore the small spin gap seems to be a feature of the ferromagnetic @xmath77 case .",
    "note that the phase with @xmath215 , @xmath216 is unusual , because neither the field @xmath217 nor its dual @xmath218 can be pinned ( since @xmath219 contains the cosine terms containing both fields with equal magnitude ) .",
    "the properties of this phase , which follow closely from an earlier analysis of the heisenberg ladder by shelton , nersessyan and tsvelik@xcite , are explored in appendix [ app : c_1s_1.5 ] .",
    "the main conclusion is that essentially  half \" of the relative spin mode is gapped , and the other half is gapless .",
    "therefore we denote this phase as c@xmath220s@xmath6 .",
    "given that the system is in a c@xmath5s@xmath6 phase , the physical susceptibilities can be calculated in a similar way to that described in [ ] , with addition of the charge modes . for an example of such a calculation , see appendix [ app : c_1s_1.5 ] .",
    "the leading temperature dependence of these susceptibilities depends only on the total charge luttinger parameter @xmath221 .",
    "the superconducting susceptibility is @xmath222 for both singlet and triplet pairing , which gives that the superconducting susceptibility is divergent for @xmath43 ( _ i.e. _ even for strongly repulsive interactions ) .",
    "other susceptibilities are @xmath134 sdw and cdw , with @xmath223 and @xmath133 cdw : @xmath224 the superconducting susceptibility is the most divergent one for @xmath44 . assuming that the relative charge mode @xmath225 is gapped , it is possible to extract @xmath36 from the density profile in the dmrg simulation ( see fig .",

    "fitting @xmath227 of chains with different lengths to this expression , we obtain @xmath229 .",
    "since nqr measures of the spin - lattice relaxation rate have been done on superconducting pr-247 , it is interesting to extract the temperature dependence of this quantity from the theory . assuming that the main relaxation mechanism is the coupling of the nuclear spins to fluctuations of the local magnetic field due to electronic spins , @xmath18 is given byscalapinonmr :    @xmath230    where @xmath231 is the form factor of the hyperfine hamiltonian",

    "the fact that a power law is seen above @xmath4 is a clear evidence for the absence of a spin gap , and is consistent with a c@xmath5s@xmath243 phase .",
    "according to the measurement , @xmath244 above @xmath7 . comparing this behavior to ( [ t1theory ] ) , we see that it corresponds to @xmath245 .",
    "this is consistent with dominant superconducting correlations .",
    "the value of @xmath36 extracted from the nqr data is substantially larger than the one extracted from our dmrg calculation .",
    "clearly , this is a significant discrepancy .",
    "however , it is well known that @xmath36 is a non - universal exponent , and in this case it depends strongly on microscopic details of the problem .",
    "since the detailed aspects of the microscopic model are certainly not `` realistic , '' we do not feel that any microscopic calculation can be expected to predict the experimental value of @xmath36 reliably .",
    "a better strategy is thus to extract @xmath36 directly from experiments .",
    "as we saw , in the superconducting sample this yields a value of @xmath36 that corresponds to dominant superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the nqr measurement was done on with a sample with an oxygen content @xmath246 which is close to the optimal value for superconductivity .",
    "we are not aware of any similar nqr data on samples with a different o content and @xmath4 .",
    "were such data obtained , we would predict a smaller power should govern the @xmath247 dependence of @xmath248 , corresponding to a lower @xmath36 .",
    "to summarize , we have considered the possibility of zigzag chain - driven superconductivity in pr@xmath41ba@xmath249cu@xmath250o@xmath251 . assuming that the chains are weakly coupled , this implies that the single zigzag chain must have a large superconducting susceptibility .",
    "this , in conjunction with the fact that cu nqr experiments do not show any spin gap above @xmath4 , raises the possibility that the zigzag chain is in a phase in which some , but not all , of the modes of the two - component electron gas are gapped . we have shown evidence for such a phase using a microscopic copper - oxygen model for the zigzag chain .",
    "the gapping of some of the relative spin and charge modes enhances superconducting ( as well as other ) fluctuations at low temperatures .",
    "the pairing operator is composed of one hole from each chain with zero center of mass momentum . since there is no spin gap ,",

    "h_int_bos ) , we see that in order for the spin gap to vanish we must have @xmath216 in ( [ h_int_bos ] ) ) .",
    "the remaining term is then proportional to @xmath253 .",
    "the total scaling dimension of this term with respect to the luttinger liquid fixed point is @xmath254 , with @xmath255 , so it will grow under an rg  transformation . at some scale ,",
    "@xmath199 becomes of the order of unity , and we can replace @xmath256 and @xmath257 by their mean value ( since the field @xmath209 will be pinned to the minimum of the potential ) .",
    "however , since the interaction contains the cosines of the conjugate fields @xmath258 and @xmath218 with an equal weights , both fields fluctuate strongly at the fixed point , and neither is pinned .",
    "we are faced with the problem of how to describe the low - energy properties of the resulting phase .",
    "a remarkably elegant solution for this problem is given in a paper by shelton _",
    "et al _ [ ] .",
    "they considered the problem of two weakly coupled spin @xmath259 chains , but the results are readily generalized to our case by neglecting the fluctuations in the @xmath209 field , replacing it by its mean value .",
    "the hamiltonian ( h_boson ) can then be solved by re - fermionizing of the fields @xmath196 .",
    "we introduce two dirac fermions , @xmath260 and @xmath261 , as follows : @xmath262 where @xmath263 and @xmath90 denote right or left moving fields .",
    "the hamiltonian for @xmath260 is then just a free dirac hamiltonian : @xmath264 the interaction hamiltonian @xmath166 ( [ h_int ] ) becomes quadratic in @xmath261 , giving @xmath265 here @xmath266 depends on @xmath199 and the average of the @xmath209 part in ( [ h_int ] ) .",

    "we therefore denote this phase as a c@xmath212s@xmath243 phase .",
    "setting @xmath274 in ( [ h_int ] ) will gap out also the total spin mode , giving a c@xmath212s@xmath213 phase .",
    "moreover , adding less relevant inter- or intra - chain operators to ( [ h_int ] ) would generate the @xmath200 term , even if it is not present in the bare hamiltonian .",

    "therefore , at intermediate energies ( or temperatures ) between @xmath124 and @xmath275 , the physics is expected to be dominated by the unstable c@xmath212s@xmath243 fixed point .",

    "this correlation function is expected to have logarithmic corrections due to marginal operators , which we have neglected .",
    "the @xmath209 field is massive , so at long distances we can replace @xmath283 by its expectation value .",

    "it is nevertheless possible to calculate its correlations , following a method used in [ ] .",
    "we describe this method briefly here .",
    "the relative spin sector , which is described as two independent majorana theories , can be further mapped onto two 2d ising models . since one of the majorana fields",
    "is massless and the other is massive , one of the corresponding ising fields is at criticality and the other is away from criticality . it can be shown that the four operators @xmath285 , @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 have the following correspondance to the order and disorder operators of the two ising models@xcite : @xmath289 here @xmath290 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 , @xmath293 are the order / disorder operators of the two ising models labelled 1 and 2 .",
    "note that the scaling dimension of all the operators in the left hand side of ( operator_correspondance ) at criticality is @xmath294 , which is consistent with the fact that the dimension of the ising operators at criticality is @xmath295 .",
    "carrying out the correspondence to the ising model carefully , one finds that the ising model labelled by 1 is in its disordered phase , so @xmath296 , @xmath297 .",

    "this can be understood as a consequence of the fact that  half \" of the @xmath301 mode is gapped .",
