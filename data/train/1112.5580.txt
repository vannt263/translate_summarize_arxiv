    "the controlled generation of quantum entanglement is an essential process for performing a wide range of tasks in the field of quantum information  @xcite .",
    "quantum communication protocols such as teleportation  @xcite , key distribution  @xcite and dense  coding  @xcite all require the generation of entangled states .",
    "entanglement is also generated during quantum computation  @xcite and in the simulation of many - body quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "so far , small - sized entangled states have been generated in a wide range of physical setups , with photonic systems representing one of the most promising due to their speed and flexibility .",
    "recently much attention has been focused on generating multiqubit entangled states such as cluster  @xcite , graph  @xcite and dicke  @xcite states , as well as those with more unusual structures and correlations  @xcite in a probabilistic fashion .",
    "schemes that allow for the deterministic generation of smaller two - qubit entangled states have also been realized  @xcite , although low generation rates make these approaches challenging at present for building up to larger multiqubit entangled states .",
    "photonic setups that generate states probabilistically , although inherently non - scalable , provide a readily available test - bed for probing the unique properties of quantum systems .",
    "current experiments are however limited to entangled states of ten - qubits or less  @xcite .",
    "improving photon generation rates using new types of sources and understanding better the practical requirements for generating high - quality entanglement between these sources may open up access to even larger entangled states with more complex structures .",
    "this would enable the testing of quantum protocols and probing physical phenomena that only more sizable quantum systems are able to support .    in this work",
    "we report the first experiment to fuse photons from two independent photonic crystal fiber ( pcf ) sources into polarization entangled states .",
    "the fusion operation we demonstrate could be used to generate larger multiqubit entangled states , such as cluster and graph states for use in future quantum photonic technologies  @xcite , including quantum communication and computation .",
    "we also introduce a novel method to characterize the fusion process that could be applied to a variety of different setups , including bulk , waveguide and on - chip photonic systems . while the fusion process is probabilistic in our experiment , we comment on how it may be made deterministic in the long term for the purposes of building large scalable entangled quantum systems .",
    "our pcf sources have a very high photon generation rate compared to commonly used nonlinear crystal sources  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they make use of a zero - slope section of the phase - matching curve to produce photons in an intrinsically pure state , enabling good quality quantum interference without the need for spectral filtering ( with inherent loss ) resulting in high count rates  @xcite .",
    "we detect  90,000 coincidences per second from photon pairs produced with a pump laser power of 10.5mw . in this context , we investigate the fusion of photons from two independent sources in detail and provide a full quantum process reconstruction .",
    "we do this by developing a theoretical model to describe the entangling operation that includes the main causes of imperfection between the photons being fused .",
    "we find that our model fits well with the experimental results .",
    "our work shows how non - ideal settings limit the success of the fusion operation and provides detailed information about the practical requirements for using it to generate large multiqubit entangled states in bulk  @xcite and on - chip quantum photonic settings  @xcite .",
    "the fusion is performed with a fiber polarizing beamsplitter ( fpbs ) , which is better suited than the bulk optics equivalent for integration into more complex schemes and scaling up to generate larger entangled states , where space constraints and coupling stability become important considerations .",
    "as it is waveguide - based , it is also interferometrically stable and well suited to the generation of resource states that are to be transmitted and received over fiber networks , for use in distributed quantum communication and networking protocols .",
    "our setup for fusing photons from two independent pcf sources is depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "a ti : sapphire laser emits 8 nm pulses at a wavelength of 724 nm with a repetition rate of 80 mhz , which are then filtered to 1 nm . the pulses are split at a 50:50 beamsplitter ( bs ) and rotated to horizontal polarization by halfwave plates ( hwps ) in both arms , then passed through polarizing beamsplitters ( pbss ) and launched into the two pcfs . the fibers each produce a pair of photons ( signal and idler ) polarized orthogonally to the pump via four - wave mixing with nondegenerate wavelengths of 625 nm for the signals and 860 nm for the idlers .",
    "while these wavelengths can be tuned by changing the wavelength of the pump pulse , the photons are only emitted in an intrinsically pure state at this section of the phase - matching curve  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath4 twist in the fiber ensures these photons exit the pcfs horizontally polarized , with an aspheric lens directing them into the polarizing beamplitters ( pbss ) , which transmit them .",
    "the pbs helps to filter out the pump pulses , which exit the fiber vertically polarized , and unpolarized background such as raman scattering .",
    "an isolator ( iso ) at the output of the laser , which allows only one - way transmission , blocks any reflected pulses from entering back into the laser .",
    "the photon pairs are then separated into different paths using dichroic mirrors ( dm ) .",
    "the separated idler photons pass through a long- and short - pass filter tilted to give a tunable transmission window of  4 nm fwhm , which transmits the idler whilst removing as much raman background as possible .",
    "they are then collected in single mode fibers followed by additional pbss which remove background from reflected light in the pcfs .",
    "multi - mode fibers are used to couple the idler to the detectors , where detections at d3 and d4 are used to herald the generation of the signal photons .",
    "the signal photons are rotated to diagonal polarization by hwps and pass through a 40 nm fwhm bandpass filter .",
    "this bandwidth is large compared to the signal photon because the intrinsically pure state phase - matching makes narrow filtering unnecessary , and the filter only needs to remove any remaining light from the bright pump beam .",
    "they are then collected into single - mode fibers to guarantee optimal spatial overlap on the fpbs .",
    "fiber polarization controllers ( pcs ) compensate for the effects on the polarization of strain - induced birefringence in the fibers . a quarter wave plate ( qwp ) , hwp , qwp chain on mode 2 compensates any unwanted phase from the fpbs .",
    "multi - mode fibers are used to couple the photons to the detectors .",
    "the detection of a photon at detector d1a ( or d1b ) with detector d2a ( or d2b ) together with detections at detectors d3 and d4 are used in a fourfold coincidence circuit to register a successful fusion . here",
    ", the use of two detectors on each signal mode enables active filtering of higher - order photon emissions from four - wave mixing in the pcfs .",
    "the fiber polarizing beamsplitter ( fpbs ) depicted in fig .  [ setup ] transmits horizontal polarized photons ( h ) and reflects vertical polarized photons ( v ) .",
    "ideally it can be described by a unitary operation with respect to the reduced two - photon basis @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) represents two photons of different polarization in the first ( second ) mode and the vacuum , @xmath8 , in the second ( first ) . in the case",
    "that we ` monitor ' the number of photons present in the output ports ,  _ i.e. _  we gain information about the photon number but not the polarization , then the fpbs is described by the non - unitary trace - preserving channel @xmath9 , with @xmath10 . here",
    "the kraus operator @xmath11 describes an operation into the ` coincidence basis ' , or subspace of the hilbert space with states having a single photon in each output mode @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the second kraus operator @xmath14 describes an operation out of the subspace defined by the coincidence basis @xmath15 and into a subspace of the basis @xmath16 with states having two photons in one of the output modes .",
    "as all operations are limited to the two - photon subspace defined by @xmath16 , both @xmath17 and @xmath18 do not contain any basis states outside this subspace , such as @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , for input states restricted to the coincidence basis one can drop the last two terms from @xmath17 and by monitoring the output of the fpbs in the coincidence basis only , allowing these states to be transmitted and rejecting all other cases , one can also drop the @xmath18 operator to give the non - unitary non trace - preserving channel @xmath20 .",
    "this channel describes the combined action of the fpbs and monitoring in the coincidence basis with the kraus operator @xmath21 this is a parity check operation  @xcite in the sense that only states where both of the photons have the same polarization ( even parity ) are allowed to be transmitted .",
    "this operation can be used as a fundamental component in a variety of quantum protocols , such as quantum error correction  @xcite , entanglement purification  @xcite and filtering  @xcite .",
    "it also forms part of an efficient method to generate cluster state resources that can be used to carry out quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the parity check is used in type - i fusion for efficiently building one - dimensional  @xcite and two - dimensional cluster states  @xcite and can also be considered as a basic fusion operation ; if successful , it matches type - i fusion , but without the loss of any photons involved  @xcite . in our experiment , however , in order to ` monitor ' the output photon number in the coincidence basis we detect the photons by destroying them .",
    "thus our parity check , or fusion operation , is a postselected version and not scalable in its current form , unlike type - i fusion  @xcite .",
    "this is due to an exponential decrease in the total success probability when using many of these operations .",
    "it should be noted that active monitoring in the coincidence basis without destroying the photons can be achieved in principle using a non - demolition type measurement of the photon number  @xcite , making this approach scalable using the techniques of ref .",
    "however , such measurements require the photons to pass through media with a large nonlinear response at the single - photon level , which is technically challenging at present and beyond the scope of this work  @xcite .",
    "ideally , the fpbs channel @xmath22 from eq .",
    "( [ fusek ] ) takes two photons in the state @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and fuses them into the maximally entangled state @xmath26 $ ] , equivalent to a two - qubit cluster state under a local hadamard rotation on the first qubit .",
    "the above fusion operation occurs with success probability @xmath27 due to the non trace - preserving nature of the channel .",
    "note that regardless of the success probability of a given input state @xmath28 being transmitted into the coincidence basis , the channel @xmath22 always acts with unit probability .",
    "either a coincidence is measured and the input state is transmitted into the coincidence basis , or no coincidence is measured and the input state is not transmitted into the coincidence basis . moreover , if both photons represent the end qubits of two seperate linear cluster states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ]  * ( b ) * , then after passing through the channel @xmath22 the cluster states are fused together ; here the two linear cluster states involved are joined with one of the photons representing the middle qubit between the edges bonding to the two clusters and the other photon representing a qubit directly attached to it  @xcite .",
    "if failure occurs one tries again with the next qubits in both clusters  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional cluster states can also be formed using the channel @xmath22 as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ]  * ( c ) * , or in a scalable way based on the techniques of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "in order to check that our fpbs is implementing the correct fusion operation @xmath22 and coherently interfering two input photons in the required spatio - temporal manner we set the input state of the two signal photons to @xmath24 and modify a time delay @xmath29 between the input photon pulses using a translation stage , as shown in  fig .  [ setup ] .",
    "this allows us to maximize the coincidence probability temporally , with the fpbs single - mode input fibers ensuring good spatial overlap . at the detectors we measure the coincidence probability for the @xmath30 state population , which for the expected entangled state @xmath1 would give 1/2",
    "however , the state @xmath1 is produced from the fusion process acting on the input state @xmath31 with a probability 1/2 , so we expect the total coincidence probability to be 1/4 . on the other hand , for an incoherent interference of the two photons ,  _",
    "i.e. _  when @xmath29 is larger than the mutual coherence time of the incoming photons @xmath32 , but less than our detector coincidence time - window @xmath33 , the probability for a coincidence is 1/8 upon considering all possible outcomes of the non - interfering photons .",
    "thus , as we modify the time delay @xmath29 in our setup , we look for an ` antidip ' or peak in the coincidence probability ( number of coincidences ) . this is a hong - ou - mandel type interference effect  @xcite and a rigorous time - dependent derivation of the quantum interference phenomenon leading to this antidip in the coincidence probability is outlined in appendix a. here one finds that the probability for a coincidence at a set time delay of @xmath29 is given by @xmath34        where @xmath35 is the pulse duration of the signal photon , defined as @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the full width at half maximum of the signal s spectral intensity . in our experiment @xmath38ps and @xmath37",
    "corresponds to @xmath39 nm . for complete temporal overlap @xmath40 and for coherent interference",
    "we expect a coincidence probability of 1/4 . on the other hand for large @xmath29 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , and with the coincidence time - window larger @xmath43 we have incoherent interference and the coincidence probability drops to 1/8 as mentioned above .    in fig .",

    "these generation rates and corresponding state properties show the potential of using pcfs for the controlled generation of larger multi - qubit entangled states for carrying out quantum protocols and investigating quantum phenomena with desired state qualities and success rates .",
    "spatial - temporal mode mismatch , loss and higher - order photon emission are sources of error leading to deviation of our experimental data from the ideal case in both the coincidence probability and state tomography .",
