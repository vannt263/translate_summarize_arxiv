    "little is known about the stellar properties , extinction , and the expected intrinsic ly@xmath2  emission of distant , high redshift galaxies .",
    "indeed , although it has in the recent past become possible through various techniques to detect already sizeable numbers of galaxies at @xmath10 ( see e.g.  the reviews of taniguchi et al .",
    "2003 and spinrad 2004 ) the information available on these objects remains generally scant .",
    "for example , in many cases the galaxies are just detected in two photometric bands and ly@xmath2  line emission , when present , serves to determine the spectroscopic redshift ( e.g.  bremer  2004 , dickinson  2004 , bunker  2004 ) .",
    "then the photometry is basically used to estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) assuming standard conversion factors between the uv restframe light and the sfr , and nothing is known about the extinction , and the properties of the stellar population ( such as age , detailed star formation histories etc . )    at higher redshift ( @xmath11 ) even less information is generally available ( but see a recent study of eyles  2005 on two @xmath12 galaxies observed with hst and spitzer ) .",
    "many objects are found by ly@xmath2  emission , but remain weak or sometimes even undetected in the continuum ( e.g.  rhoads & malhotra 2001 , kodaira  2003 , cuby  2003 , ajiki  2003 , taniguchi et al .",
    "2004 ) . in these cases the ly@xmath2  luminosity can be determined and used to estimate a sfr using again standard conversion factors .",
    "also the ly@xmath2  equivalent width is estimated , providing some possible clue on the nature of these sources . however , this has lead to puzzling results e.g.  for the sources from the lala survey which seem to show unusually large ly@xmath2  equivalent widths that are difficult to understand without invoking exceptional conditions ( popiii stars ? ; malhotra & rhoads 2002 , rhoads  2003 ) .",
    "given the few data available for the lala sources it is fair to say that the nature of these objects , their stellar populations , extinction etc .",
    "remain currently largely unknown ( cf .",
    "dawson  2004 ) .",
    "when possible , a simple comparison between the uv and ly@xmath2  sfr is undertaken providing possibly information on the ly@xmath2  transmission , i.e.  the partial absorption of ly@xmath2  photons on their sight line through the intergalactic medium ( e.g.  haiman 2002 , santos 2004 ) and/or on partial ly@xmath2  `` destruction '' processes close to the source ( e.g.  due to dust or ism geometry ; charlot & fall 1993 , valls - gabaud 1993 , tenorio - tagle  1999 , mas - hesse  2003 ) .",
    "notable exceptions of @xmath13 samples for which some estimate of extinction is available from multi - band photometry include work on the subaru deep survey ( ouchi  2004 ) and _ goods _ data ( e.g.  papovich  2004 ) .",
    "lehnert & bremer ( 2004 ) also discuss some preliminary information on little extinction in their @xmath14 sources .",
    "interestingly , in their study of a @xmath15 galaxy discovered by dey  ( 1998 ) , armus  ( 1998 ) find indications for significant reddening ( @xmath16 mag ) from analysis of the observed sed and from the presence of ly@xmath2  emission .    in a similar manner we will here present a consistent study of the stellar population properties , extinction , and ly@xmath2  emission for two galaxies at redshift @xmath11 . for this aim we use two distant ( @xmath11 ) gravitationally lensed galaxies for which multi - band photometry is available ( detection in at least 34 bands ) . through a quantitative analysis of their sed , using a vast library of empirical and theoretical template spectra",
    ", we aim to constrain properties of the stellar populations , such as age and star formation ( hereafter sf ) history ( burst or constant sf ? ) and their extinction . furthermore by comparing the ly@xmath2  emission expected from the stellar population constraint with the observed ly@xmath2  flux we estimate consistently the ly@xmath2  `` transmission '' for the individual sources",
    ".    the ly@xmath2  transmission and sf properties derived here can in principle be used to infer the ionisation fraction of hydrogen in the igm at a given redshift ( cf .",
    "haiman 2002 , santos 2004 ) , a key quantity of interest for the study of the reionisation history of the universe ( cf .",
    "review from barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "obviously the present `` exploratory '' work will have to be extended to larger galaxy samples , and sophisticated tools will probably be needed to interpret such results in terms of igm properties ( cf .",
    "gnedin & prada 2004 )",
    ". however , this approach should be complementary to other methods probing the reionisation history by measuring the gunn - peterson optical depth observed in quasar spectra as a function of redshift ( e.g.  becker  2001 , fan  2003 ) , or by comparing ly@xmath2  luminosity functions at different redshifts ( e.g.  malhotra & rhoads 2004 ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "[ s_obs ] we summarise the adopted observational constraints from the literature . our modeling technique is described in sect .",
    "[ s_models ] .",
    "the detailed results for each galaxy are presented in sects .",
    "[ s_370 ] and [ s_kesr ] .",
    "our main conclusion are summarised in sect .",
    "[ s_conclude ] .",
    "the two galaxies studied here are : 1 ) the probable @xmath1 galaxy recently discovered by kneib  ( 2004 , hereafter kesr ) , which presently lacks of a spectroscopic redshift but for which rather accurate multi - band hst observations are available , allowing us in particular also to derive a fairly reliable photometric redshift .",
    "2 ) the @xmath0 ly@xmath2  emitter hcm 6a behind the lensing cluster abell 370 .",
    "we now summarise the observational data , taken from the literature .",
    "the adopted redshift and gravitational magnification factors are listed in table [ tab_props ] .    before proceeding let us mention for clarity that these two objects are generally considered to be star forming galaxies ( starbursts ) , not agn ( narrow line - type ii - or others ) , as no contradicting information is available so far .",
    "however , one must bear in mind that some of the interpretations presented below ( and in the literature ) may need to be revised , should this assumption be incorrect .    * triple arc in abell 2218 : * the observational data for this object , named abell 2218 kesr hereafter , is taken from kneib et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter kesr ) and from egami  ( 2005 ) .",
    "the photometry from kesr includes observations with hst ( wfpc2 , acs , nicmos ) in ( undetected ) , , , and , and with nirc / keck in @xmath17 .",
    "subsequently , additional photometry was obtained with nicmos / hst in the @xmath17 band ( f110w ) , and with irac / spitzer at 3.6 and 4.5  ( see egami et al . ) for our computations ( see below ) we have used the appropriate filter transmission curves . in particular , updated transmission curves were used for the acs and nicmos filters ( m. sirianni 2003 , private communication ; sirianni et al .",
    "2004 ; r.  thompson 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "few brief comments concerning the photometry are needed here .",
    "first , kesr present photometry for two multiple images ( a and b ) . apparently sources a and b differ in the  flux ( with quoted errors of @xmath18 0.05 mag ) by 3.2 @xmath6 , whereas the fluxes in the other filters agree well within 1 @xmath6 .",
    "differential lensing across the images together with sampling effects could be responsible for this small discrepancy .",
    "as we are interested in a global representative sed for this source , we have chosen to use the averaged photometric sed , the magnification factors being the same for the two images . finally , we have also noted some apparent discrepancies between the measurements reported in kesr and egami , the most important one being the  flux , which is @xmath5 1520 % ( 34 @xmath6 ) higher in the latter publication .",
    "these differences are mostly due to the use of different apertures on different repixeled / rescaled images ( j.  richard , 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "again , this illustrates the difficulty in deriving reliable colors for extended arcs . to account for these small discrepancies and for the possible error",
    "underestimate we therefore adopt a minimum photometric error of 0.15 mag in all filters .",
    "it is worth noting that photometric errors translate into absolute flux calibration errors for fitting purposes . as we will see below , adopting the latter minimum errorbars significantly improves the sed fits .",
    "in addition to the photometry , the non - detection of the source with keck lris spectroscopy provides an upper limit on the continuum flux between 9000 and 9300   ( kesr ) .",
    "this upper limit will be used as an additional constraint in our sed modeling .",
    "kesr also indicate a possible drop of the continuum below @xmath5 9800   from their keck ii nirspec spectrum . for various reasons",
    "the reality of this spectral break is questionable .",
    "first a true neutral hydrogen break ( `` ly@xmath2  break '' ) at @xmath5 9800  , far in the red wing of the  filter , seems incompatible with the relatively strong flux measured in this filter .",
    "furthermore , test computations show that such a break is difficult if not impossible to reconcile with our spectral modeling . in any case",
    "the significance of this finding appears questionable as the detected continuum is extremely faint and noisy .",
    "the reality of this spectral feature is now also questioned by egami  ( 2005 ) . for these reasons",
    "this information is discarded from our spectral fitting .    in practice",
    "we have retained the following two variants to describe the observed sed of this source : _",
    "sed1 ) _ the average fluxes ( , , , ) of images a and b from kesr plus the irac / spitzer data of image b from egami et al . _ sed2 ) _ all fluxes from image b from egami et al .",
    "these are treated as seds from two different objects .",
    "furthermore , for each of these `` objects '' we have computed two cases in our sed fitting described below : _",
    "i ) _ the observed seds in , , , , 3.6 , and 4.5 .",
    "_ ii ) _ same as ( i ) plus the flux limits from the  and keck lris non - detections .",
    "no emission line has so far been detected for abell 2218 kesr .",
    "its spectroscopic redshift remains therefore presently unknown but the well - constrained mass model for the cluster strongly suggests a redshift @xmath19 6 for this source ( kesr , egami  2005 ) .",
    "the magnification factors of both images a and b is @xmath20 , according to kesr .    *",
    "abell 370 hcm6a : * the observational data of this @xmath0 galaxy is taken from hu et al .  (",
    "the photometry includes @xmath21 from keck i and ii ( lris and echellette spectrograph and imager ) and from subaru ( cisco / ohs ) . the gravitational magnification of the source is @xmath22 according to hu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "photometric fluxes and errors were adopted from their fig .",
    "3 . where possible the appropriate filter transmission curves were used .",
    "the `` @xmath23 '' band filter transmission is somewhat uncertain , as these observations were undertaken using an rg850 filter , which together with the lris optics and the ccd response , yields a transmission similar to a @xmath23 band filter ( hu et al .",
    "our approximate filter curve shows a blueward shift of @xmath24 by @xmath5 200   compared to the information given by hu et al .",
    "however , since the redshift is known for this source and since we adjust the observed flux ( not magnitude ) in this band , this should not affect our conclusions .",
    "before proceeding to the fits of the individual seds a brief comment on the available sed features seems appropriate .    for obvious reasons the available sed ( basically from broad - band photometry ) of high - z ( @xmath11 ) galaxies",
    "is primarily limited to the rest - frame uv ( when observed from the ground ) or optical spectrum ( when available e.g. with spitzer and future satellite missions ) .",
    "the main information `` encoded '' in this sed is therefore : _ 1 ) _ the neutral hi break shortward of ly@xmath2  ( hereafter the `` ly@xmath2 '' break ) due to the strong or complete gunn - peterson trough , _ 2 ) _ the slope of the uv spectrum , and _ 3 ) _ possibly a 4000   break ( hereafter denoted balmer break ) , if present and covered by the observations .",
    "in addition the presence of the ly@xmath2  line , mostly used to determine spectroscopically the redshift , provides clear evidence for ongoing massive star formation ( hereafter sf ) .",
    "the position of the ly@xmath2  break depends essentially on redshift .",
    "the uv slope depends on the intrinsic spectrum  in turn depending mostly on age and sf history  and on the extinction , i.e.  the extinction law and the amount of reddening .",
    "the balmer break becomes visible ( in absorption ) in the continuum of stellar populations after @xmath25 1030 myr .",
    "ly@xmath2  emission , if due to stellar photoionisation and not agn activity , indicates the presence of young ( @xmath26 10 myr ) massive ionizing stars .",
    "concerning the uv slope , it is useful to recall that this quantity , are defined as the power - law index of the sed in @xmath27 versus @xmath28 over a certain wavelength interval . ]",
    "does not lend itself to determine the metallicity of a star forming galaxy from a theoretical point of view and in terms of individual objects .",
    "the reasons are that intrinsically the uv slope shows only small variations with metallicity , and that the slope depends strongly on the exact sf history ( see e.g.  leitherer & heckman 1995 , meurer  1995 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_beta ] where @xmath29 ( measured over the interval 1300 - 1800  ) is plotted as a function of age for populations of metallicities between solar and zero ( popiii ) and for the limiting cases of bursts and sfr = const . furthermore",
    ", as pointed out in schaerer ( 2002 , 2003 ) and also shown in this figure , for very low metallicities ( @xmath30 ) nebular continuous emission becomes dominant even down to uv wavelengths ( longward of ly@xmath2 ) , such that the observed integrated ( stellar+nebular ) spectrum has even a flatter uv slope than high metallicity starbursts .",
    "in other words , even for bursts , there are strong intrinsic degeneracies of @xmath29 between age and metallicity , to which the additional effect of reddening must be added , including the uncertainties on the a priori unknown extinction law .",
    "it is therefore evident that on an individual object basis there are in general degeneracies between age , metallicity , sf history , and extinction .",
    "however , this does not preclude the possible existence of statistical correlations between quantities such as e.g.  @xmath29 and metallicity in large samples of galaxies , as known to hold e.g.  for local uv selected starbursts ( cf .",
    "heckman et al .  1998 ) .",
    "also , as we will see below , there are cases where the uv slope and the mere fact of the presence of an emission line allow us nevertheless to lift some degeneracies and therefore to determine interesting constraints on the stellar population and on extinction .",
    "the behaviour of the 4000   break and its use as an age indicator has extensively been discussed in the literature ( e.g.  bruzual 1983 , and recently kauffmann  2003 ) . as in simple stellar populations",
    "its amplitude is basically a monotonically increasing function of age , an estimate of the break , e.g.  obtained from 3.8 - 4.5  photometry with irac / spitzer and jhk photometry in @xmath31 galaxies , provides information on the age of the light emitting stellar population . since the exact sf history can not be determined in these cases ( in contrast to studies at low @xmath32 , cf .",
    "kauffmann ) the amplitude of the break provides a range of ages , the minimum age being given by instantaneous bursts , the maximum age from models with constant sf . for obvious reasons this maximum",
    "`` luminosity weighted '' age derived from a measure of the balmer break is also unaffected by considerations of possible multiple stellar populations .",
    "the same is not true for the minimum age , which is , however , of less cosmological interest .      for the spectral fitting we use a slightly adapted version of the photometric redshift code   of bolzonella et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "does standard sed fitting using a number of modeling parameters .",

    "the source redshift is also a free parameter .    for the spectral templates we use a large compilation of empirical and theoretical sed , including starbursts , qso , and galaxies of all hubble types , and covering various star formation histories ( bursts , exponentially decreasing , constant sf ) and various metallicities . for most applications we group the templates in the following way :    * * starbursts and qsos ( hereafter sb+qso ) : * this group includes the starburst templates with @xmath33 from @xmath34 to 0.7 from the calzetti et al .",

    "we also explore the possible implications of other laws , such as the galactic law of seaton ( 1979 ) including the 2200   bump , and the smc law from prvot  ( 1984 ) and bouchet  ( 1985 ) showing no uv bump , but a steeper increase of the extinction in the uv compared to calzetti",
    ".    for the lyman forest attenuation ,  follows madau ( 1995 ) .",

    "earlier versions of  and other codes ( e.g.  evolutionary synthesis codes ) assume sometimes ( for `` historical '' reasons ) that transmission curves be given in flux units . in case of wide filters , e.g.  such as some acs / hst filters , this may lead to small differences .",
    "other modifications concern essentially features related to the user interface ( additional outputs etc . ) .    for given choices of the above parameters , the  code performs a standard minimisation fit to the observed seds and determines , for each point in the parameter space , the corresponding @xmath43 value .",
    "using these @xmath43 values , it is possible to quantify the probabilities for the main free parameters , namely extinction , age of the spectral template , sf history , etc .",
    "when the sed fitting is based on theoretical templates , the sfr value is easily obtained and allows us to compare the expected values for the ly@xmath2  flux to the actual ones .    to convert the observed / adjusted quantities to absolute values we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 km s@xmath47 mpc@xmath47 .",
    "as a spectroscopic redshift has not been obtained ( yet ) for this galaxy we here examine its photometric redshift estimate . in fig .",
    "[ fig_pz_7 ] we show the photometric redshift probability distributions  for the two seds ( sed1 , sed2 ) of abell 2218 kesr described above using the three spectral template groups and adopting a minimum photometric error of 0.15 mag . for each redshift ,  quantifies the quality of the best fit model obtained varying all other parameters ( i.e.  extinction , , spectral template among template group ) .",

    "alternatively , if intrinsically present , the ly@xmath2  non - detection could be due a variety of factors : a redshift @xmath61 placing ly@xmath2  below the spectral range discussed in detail by kesr , a flux below their strongly varying detection threshold , or other factors depressing the ly@xmath2  emission within the host galaxy ( dust , ism+hi geometry ) and in the intervening igm .    in conclusion , from the available data",
    "the apparent lack of ly@xmath2  emission from this source is not puzzling .",
    "however , it is not completely excluded that the galaxy truely shows ly@xmath2  emission , which has so far eluded detection .      after these main findings",
    "we shall now quickly mention more `` technical '' results about the influence of various fit parameters .",
    "quite generally , the results on the age , sf history , extinction etc .  depend little on the different variants of the observed seds ( sed1 - 2 ) , on the inclusion or not of the non - detections in the fits , and on the use of the published formal errors or a minimum error of 0.15 mag ( cf .",
    "[ s_obs ] ) .",
    "the results discussed above are therefore quite robust with respect to these assumptions .",
    "small differences in the best fit values can , however , be obtained .",

    "we note that sed1 allows better fits ( smaller @xmath43 ) than sed2 . adopting @xmath62 mag",
    "also significantly increases the fit quality .",
    "finally , considering variations around the mean lyman forest attenuation improves the fits ( especially as the hst photometry determining the `` ly@xmath2  break '' is quite accurate ) . in practice",
    "all best fits are found with an increased lyman - forest opacity ( @xmath49 ) .    to summarise ,",
    "given the absence of a spectroscopic redshift , a fair number of good fits is found to the observations of abell 2218 kesr when considering all the free parameters .",
    "the main conclusions from these `` best fits '' are :    * generally the determined extinction is negligible or zero quite independently of the adopted extinction law .",
    "the best fit with the empirical starburst spectrum of sbs 0335 - 052 represents an exception to this case , requiring an additional @xmath8 0.20.6 mag , depending on the adopted extinction law . *",
    "although generally burst models fit somewhat better than those with constant star formation among the theoretical templates ( bc , s03 + ) , the data does not strongly constrain the star formation history . * typical ages between @xmath5 15 and 400 myr are obtained . a reasonable 1-@xmath6 upper bound on the age of @xmath5",
    "650 myr can be obtained assuming constant star formation .",
    "however , the data can also be well fit with a very young ( @xmath5 35 myr ) stellar population with strong emission lines ( using e.g.   the spectrum of the metal - poor galaxy sbs 0335 - 052 ) . in this case",
    "the apparent balmer break observed between the hst and spitzer broad - band photometry is simply due to the presence of strong emission lines affecting the red 3.6 and 4.5  filters . * given degeneracies of the restframe uv spectra between age and metallicity ( cf .",
    "above ) no clear indication on the galaxian metallicity can be derived , in contrast to the claim of kesr .",
    "good fits to the available data can even be found with solar metallicity starburst templates .",
    "* depending on the star formation history and age one may or may not expect intrinsic ly@xmath2  emission , i.e. an important h  ii  region around the object .",
    "the apparent absence of observed ly@xmath2  emission does therefore not provide much insight .",
    "a more complete error analysis beyond the level presented here is difficult to achieve for a variety of reasons and clearly beyond the scope of this publication .",
    "the theoretical templates can also be used to estimate the stellar mass involved in the starburst or the star formation rate when constant star formation is assumed . for this aim",
    "we use all the best fits to the three seds ( sed1 - 3 ) with the s03 + templates , we assume a typical redshift of @xmath63 , and the magnification @xmath64 determined by kesr . for the adopted cosmology the distance luminosity is then @xmath6564457.8 mpc .",

    "how does our possible indication for a high extinction fit in with other studies ?",

    "however , this implies that dust extinction is likely present in starburst galaxies with redshifts above 6 .",
    "large amounts of dust have already been observed in qsos up to similar redshift ( bertoldi  2003 , walter  2003 ) .      to estimate properties such as the mass , sfr , and the intrinsic ly@xmath2  emission from hcm 6a we simply examine the predictions from the best fit models , scale them appropriately to the luminosity distance one has @xmath65 64005.7 mpc . ] , and correct for the gravitational magnification ( here @xmath22 ) .",

    "consider now the case of composite stellar populations . in this case",

    "formally we then have no handle on the ly@xmath2  transmission , except that it can not be very low ( say @xmath26 40 % @xmath120 ) since otherwise the associated uv flux from the young population @xmath121 would dominate the observed continuum flux @xmath122 .",

    "indeed , a high 3.6 and 4.5  flux could be a good indication for a composite stellar population , as discussed above .",
    "in addition it is important to secure higher accuracy photometry especially in the near - ir ( jhk ) to assess the accuracy of the redward increasing shape of the spectrum ( in @xmath89 ) , which drives one towards solutions with non - negligible extinction .",
    "using sed fitting techniques considering a large number of parameters ( mainly a vast library of empirical and theoretical template spectra , variable extinction and extinction laws ) we have attempted to constrain the properties of the stellar populations and ly@xmath2  emission of two strongly lensed galaxies with redshifts @xmath19 6 from their observed sed including various ground - based observations , hst , and spitzer observations .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of two strongly lensed galaxies at @xmath0 and @xmath1 for which multi - band photometric and spectroscopic observations are available . for one source </S>",
    "<S> the data include recent hst and spitzer observations . </S>",
    "<S> using an sed fitting technique considering a number of parameters ( various libraries of empirical and theoretical template spectra , variable extinction and extinction laws ) we attempt to constrain the properties of their stellar populations ( age , star formation history , mass ) and their intrinsic ly@xmath2  emission . </S>",
    "<S> the following main results are obtained for the individual galaxies :    * * triple arc in abell 2218 , probable @xmath1 galaxy : * the most likely redshift of this source is @xmath3 6.07.2 taking into account both our photometric determination and lensing considerations . </S>",
    "<S> sed fits indicate generally a low extinction ( @xmath4 ) but do not strongly constrain the star formation ( sf ) history . </S>",
    "<S> best fits have typical ages of @xmath5 3 to 400 myr . a reasonable maximum age of ( 250650 ) myr ( 1 @xmath6 interval ) can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> however , the apparent 4000   break observed recently from combination of irac / spitzer and hst observations , can also equally well be reproduced with the template of a young ( @xmath5 35 myr ) burst where strong restframe optical emission lines enhance the 3.6 and 4.5  fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated sfr is typically @xmath5 1  for a salpeter imf from 1 - 100 , in agreement with previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the unknowns on the age and star formation history could easily explain the apparent absence of ly@xmath2  in this galaxy . * </S>",
    "<S> * abell 370 hcm 6a : * the available ly@xmath2  and continuum observations indicate basically two possible solutions : 1 ) a young burst or ongoing constant sf with non - negligible extinction or 2 ) a composite young + `` old '' stellar population . in the first case one obtains a best fit @xmath7 , or @xmath8 0.51.8 at a 1 @xmath6 level . in consequence </S>",
    "<S> we obtain sfr @xmath5 1141 , higher than earlier estimates , and we estimate a fairly high total luminosity ( @xmath9 ) for this galaxy , in the range of luminous infrared galaxies . a ly@xmath2  transmission of @xmath5 2390 % is estimated from our best fit models . </S>",
    "<S> other properties ( age , sf history ) remain largely unconstrained . in case of composite stellar populations </S>",
    "<S> the sfr , mass , and luminosity estimate is lower . </S>",
    "<S> the two scenarios may be distinguishable with irac / spitzer observations at 3.6 and 4.5 .    </S>",
