    "gliese 229b is not only the first brown dwarf recognized as genuine @xcite , but it is also the brightest and best - studied t dwarf known . with an effective temperature of @xmath5k , it lies squarely between the latest l dwarfs ( @xmath6k , @xcite ) and the giant planets of the solar system ( @xmath7k ) .",
    "indeed , its near infrared spectrum shows the strong h@xmath8o absorption bands characteristic of very - low mass stars and the strong ch@xmath9 bands seen in the spectra of jupiter , saturn and titan .",
    "the transitional nature of the spectrum of gl 229b is remarkable and hints at the spectral appearance of extrasolar giant planets which have effective temperatures in the range 200 ",
    "1600@xmath10k @xcite .",
    "a wealth of data on gl 229b has accumulated since its discovery five years ago .",
    "broad band photometry from @xmath11 through @xmath12 and an accurate parallax @xcite allow an accurate determination of its bolometric luminosity .",
    "spectroscopic observations @xcite covering the range from 0.8 to 5.0@xmath13 m have revealed a very rapidly declining flux shortward of 1@xmath13 m , the unmistakable presence of ch@xmath9 , h@xmath8o , and cs , and demonstrated the _ absence _ of the crh , feh , vo and tio features characteristic of late m and early l dwarfs .",
    "finally , noll , geballe & marley ( 1997 ) and @xcite have detected co with an abundance well above the value predicted by chemical equilibrium , a phenomenon also seen in the atmosphere of jupiter .",
    "model spectra for gl 229b @xcite reproduce the overall energy distribution fairly well and all agree that 1 ) @xmath5k , 2 ) compared to gaseous molecular opacity , the dust opacity is small if not negligible in the infrared , 3 ) the gravity of gl 229b is poorly constrained at present .",
    "the rapid decline of the flux at wavelengths shortward of 1@xmath13 m is interpreted as caused by an absorbing haze of complex hydrocarbons ( griffith , yelle & marley 1998 ) or alternatively by the pressure - broadened red wing of the k i resonance doublet at 0.77@xmath13 m ( tsuji , ohnaka & aoki 1999 ; burrows , marley & sharp 1999 ) .    in this paper , we present new high - resolution spectra in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands . with the inclusion of the `` red '' spectrum of @xcite , we analyze each part of the spectrum separately to obtain independent measures of the h@xmath8o abundance of gl 229b  broadly interpreted as the metallicity index  to detect for the first time the presence of nh@xmath3 in its spectrum , and to estimate the nh@xmath3 abundance at two different depths in the atmosphere .",
    "our results are expressed in terms of the surface gravity which can not be determined from the data presented here .",
    "nevertheless , we identify a reduced set of acceptable combinations of @xmath14 and gravity , using the observed bolometric luminosity of gl 229b @xcite .",
    "the observations and the near infrared spectra are presented in  2 .",
    "section 3 shows how an accurate parallax , a well - sampled spectral energy distribution and evolutionary models greatly reduce the possible range of combinations of @xmath14 and gravity without having to resort to spectrum fitting . the synthetic spectrum calculation and our method of analysis",
    "are described in  4 .",
    "the results concerning several molecules of interest which are at least potentially detectable are presented in  5 , followed by a discussion in  6 .",
    "finally , a summary of the results and directions for future study are given in  7 .",
    "spectra of gl  229b in selected narrow intervals in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 windows were obtained at the 3.8  m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) in 1998 january , using the facility spectrometer cgs4 @xcite and its 150 l / mm grating . details of the observations are provided in table 1 .",
    "these are among the highest resolution spectra obtained of any t dwarf .",
    "the spectra were obtained in the standard stare / nod mode with the @xmath15 wide slit of the spectrometer oriented at a position angle of @xmath16 , nearly perpendicular to the line connecting gl 229a and gl 229b .",
    "the southward - going diffraction spike of gl 229a together with scattered light from that star , which is 10 magnitudes brighter than gl 229b , contaminated the array rows near and to the southwest of those containing the spectrum of gl 229b .",
    "the contamination on the gl 229b rows was determined by interpolation and was subtracted ; typically it was comparable or somewhat smaller than the signal from gl  229b . in order to remove telluric absorption features , spectra of the a0v star bs  1849 were measured just prior to gl  229b . in all cases the match in airmasses was better than five percent and hence in the ratioed spectra residual telluric features are small compared to the noise level .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved by observations of arc lamps and is in all cases better than one part in @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the spectra shown in this paper have been slightly smoothed , so that the resolving powers are lower than those in table 1 by approximately 25 percent .",
    "they also have been rebinned to facilitate coadding like spectra and joining adjacent spectral regions .",
    "the error bars can be judged by the point - to - point variations in featureless portions of the spectra , the signal - to - noise ratios at the continuum peaks are approximately 40 in the @xmath2 band , 25 in the @xmath1 band , and 30 in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the flux calibration of each spectrum is approximate as no attempt was made to match the photometry of gl 229b .",
    "while we identify the spectra by their corresponding standard photometric infrared bandpass , their wavelength coverages are much narrower than the @xmath19 filters and typically corresponds to the peak flux of gl 229b in each bandpass .    in the @xmath0 band spectrum ( fig .",
    "1 ) , nearly all features are caused by h@xmath8o .",
    "the short wavelength end of the spectrum shows the red side of a ch@xmath9 band , which is responsible for the features seen shortward of @xmath20 m .",
    "two lines of neutral potassium are easily detected near @xmath21 m .",
    "no other lines of alkali metals fall within the wavelength coverage of our observations .",
    "the @xmath1 band spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) is relatively rich in molecular opacity sources .",
    "all the features seen in the spectrum are either due to h@xmath8o ( @xmath22 m ) or part of a very strong ch@xmath9 absorption band ( @xmath23 m )",
    ". features seen between 1.59 and 1.6@xmath13 m can not presently be ascribed with certainty and are due to either h@xmath8o or ch@xmath9 . while the opacities of nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s are not negligible in this part of the spectrum , neither molecule forms distinctive spectral features .",
    "their presence can not be directly ascertained from these data , mainly because their opacity is weaker than that of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 and because of significant pressure broadening ( see  5.3 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 band flux emerges in an opacity window between a strong h@xmath8o band and a strong ch@xmath9 band ( fig .",
    "spectral features are caused by h@xmath8o at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath24 m ) and by ch@xmath9 at longer wavelengths ( @xmath25 m ) .",
    "several distinctive features of nh@xmath3 are expected at the blue end of this spectrum and models predict a single absorption feature of h@xmath8s at @xmath26 m .",
    "all features seen in figures 1  3 are unresolved blends of numerous molecular transitions .",
    "a spectral resolution at least 10 times higher would be required to resolve the intrinsic structure of the spectrum of gl 229b .",
    "while synthetic spectra have been fairly successful at reproducing the unusual spectrum of gl 229b @xcite , the entire spectral energy distribution has not yet been modeled satisfactorily .",
    "limitations in the opacity databases are partly responsible for the remaining discrepancies between synthetic spectra and the data ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "these shortcomings have impeded the determination of @xmath14 and of the gravity @xmath27 in particular .",
    "on the other hand , the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b is now well determined . combining spectroscopic and photometric data from 0.82 to 10@xmath13 m with the parallax",
    ", @xcite found @xmath28 . with new @xmath29 photometry",
    ", @xcite found @xmath30 .",
    "a recalibration using the hst photometry of @xcite gives @xmath31 .",
    "evolutionary models @xcite allow us to find a family of @xmath32 models with a given @xmath33 .",
    "figure 4 shows the cooling tracks of solar metallicity brown dwarfs in terms of the surface parameters @xmath14 and @xmath27 .",
    "models with the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b fall within the band running through the center of the figure . using a very conservative lower limit for the age of gl 229a of 0.2@xmath10gyr @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath34k . on the other hand , the gravity remains poorly determined with @xmath35 , corresponding to a mass range of 0.015  0.07@xmath36 . while the upper range is very close to the lower main sequence mass limit ,",
    "gl 229b s status as a brown dwarf is secure",
    ". a star at the edge of the main sequence would be much hotter with @xmath37k ; well outside of fig .",
    "4 .    in the remainder of this paper ,",
    "the discussion focuses on three atmosphere models which span the range of allowed solutions ( table 2 and fig .",
    "4 ) : @xmath38 ( 870 , 4.5 ) , ( 940 , 5.0 ) and ( 1030 , 5.5 ) , which we label models a , b , and c , respectively . these constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath27 from cooling sequences are quite firm .",
    "we find the same result , within the error bar on @xmath33 , from several cooling sequences which predate @xcite .",
    "the latter were computed with different input physics such as the equation of state and surface boundary conditions derived from grey and non - grey atmosphere models using several opacity tabulations .    in section 5 , we show that these three models can fit the spectra only if they have different metallicities , ranging from [ m / h]@xmath39 to @xmath40 . the evolution of brown dwarfs is sensitive to the metallicity through the atmospheric opacity which controls the rate of cooling . we find that for the range of interest here , the effect of a reduced metallicity on our determination of @xmath14 , @xmath27 , and the cooling age is smaller but comparable to that of the uncertainty on the value of @xmath33 . we choose to ignore it for simplicity .",
    "our analysis is based on the atmosphere models of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets described in @xcite . briefly",
    ", the atmospheres are in radiative / convective equilibrium and the equation of radiative transfer is solved with the k - coefficient method .",
    "the chemical equilibrium is treated as in @xcite .",
    "gas phase opacities include rayleigh scattering , the collision - induced opacity of h@xmath8 and the molecular opacities of h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 , nh@xmath3 , h@xmath8s , ph@xmath3 , and co , as well as the continuum opacities of h@xmath41 and h@xmath42 . the molecular line opacity database is described in more detail in  4.2 .",
    "atomic line opacity is not included .",
    "because of the relatively large gravity of gl 229b , pressure broadening of the molecular lines plays an important role in determining the @xmath43 profile of the atmosphere and in shaping the spectrum .",
    "the line - by - line broadening theory we use is described in @xcite .",
    "the strong continuum opacity source responsible for the rapid decrease of the flux of gl 229b shortward of 1.1@xmath13 m is included following the haze model of @xcite .",
    "details of the haze model and of our fitting procedure are given in  5.1 .",
    "the @xmath43 structures of these atmosphere models are shown in fig .",
    "the profiles intersect each other because both @xmath14 and the gravity vary between the models .",
    "the inflexion point at @xmath44 signals the top of the convection zone .    using the same monochromatic opacities used to compute the k - coefficients ,",
    "high - resolution synthetic spectra are generated from the atmospheric structures by solving the radiative transfer equation with the feautrier method on a frequency grid with @xmath45@xmath46 .",
    "spectra with resolution lower than @xmath47@xmath46 can then be generated for comparison with data .",
    "an unusual aspect of t dwarf atmospheres is the great variation of the opacity with wavelength .",
    "these atmospheres are strongly non - grey and the near infrared spectrum is sculpted by strong absorption bands of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 . most of the flux emerges in a small number of relatively transparent opacity windows .",
    "the concept of photosphere becomes rather useless since the level at which the spectrum is formed depends strongly on the wavelength .",
    "figure 6 shows the depth of the `` photosphere '' @xmath48 in both temperature and pressure as a function of wavelength for model b ( @xmath49k , @xmath50 ) . in the @xmath51 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 bands , and , to a lesser extent , in the @xmath2 and @xmath52 bands ,",
    "the atmosphere is very transparent and can be probed to great depths . for @xmath53",
    "m , the spectral energy distribution approaches a planck function with @xmath54k .",
    "figure 6 reveals that spectroscopy between 0.8 and 12@xmath13 m can probe the atmosphere from @xmath54k down to a depth where @xmath55k , corresponding to a range of 6 pressure scale heights ! this provides an exceptional opportunity to study the physics of the atmosphere of a brown dwarf over an extended vertical range .",
    "the top of the convection zone for model b ( located at @xmath56k ) is below the `` photosphere '' at all wavelengths and is not directly observable , however .      given the range of acceptable values of @xmath14 and @xmath27 (  3 ) , we can determine the metallicity of gl 229b and the abundance of several key molecules by fitting synthetic spectra to the observations , for each of the three models .",
    "the precision of our results is determined by the reliability of the models , the noise level in the data and , most significantly , by the limitations of the molecular line lists used to compute their opacities .",
    "the latter point requires a detailed discussion .",
    "the opacities of ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 are computed from line lists obtained by combining the hitran @xcite and geisa @xcite databases , which are complemented with recent laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations .",
    "further details are provided in @xcite .",
    "the resulting line lists for these two molecules are very nearly complete for @xmath57k , and their degree of completeness decreases rapidly at higher temperatures where absorption from excited level become important .",
    "furthermore , the line list of ch@xmath9 is limited to @xmath58 m .",
    "we extend the ch@xmath9 opacity to shorter wavelengths with the laboratory measurements of @xcite which provide the absorption coefficient averaged over intervals of 5@xmath10@xmath46 between 1 and 5@xmath13 m at @xmath59k .",
    "we use @xcite opacities for @xmath60 m and the line list for @xmath61 m .",
    "this puts the transition from one tabulation to the other in a strong h@xmath8o absorption band and obliterates any discontinuity in ch@xmath9 opacity at the transition . for @xmath62",
    "m , the tabulation of @xcite gives the absorption coefficient of ch@xmath9 determined from spectroscopic observations of the giant planets at 0.0004@xmath13 m intervals . because of the low temperatures found in the atmospheres of giant planets , the karkoschka ch@xmath9 opacities are appropriate for @xmath63k . to our knowledge",
    ", this compilation of nh@xmath3 and ch@xmath9 opacity is the most complete presently available .    as can be seen in figure 6 ,",
    "the temperature in the atmosphere of gl 229b is everywhere greater than 300@xmath10k .",
    "for ch@xmath9 , we compute temperature - dependent line opacity ( which is incomplete above 300@xmath10k ) from the population of excited levels determined by the boltzmann formula for @xmath61 m , and use temperature independent opacity at shorter wavelengths . while the synthetic spectra computed reproduce the fundamental band of ch@xmath9 very well ( centered at @xmath64 m ) , the match with the 1.6 and 2.3@xmath13 m bands is rather poor . even though ch@xmath9 is a very prominent molecule in the spectrum of gl 229b ,",
    "the current knowledge of its opacity is not adequate for a quantitative analysis of its spectral signature .",
    "for this reason , we have essentially ignored the regions in our spectra where ch@xmath9 is prominent . unfortunately",
    ", this prevents us from estimating the abundance of ch@xmath9  and therefore of carbon  in gl 229b .",
    "ammonia shows significant absorption in both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band spectra .",
    "the line list for nh@xmath3 starts at @xmath65 m . because the line list does not include transitions from highly excited levels which occur at @xmath66k , the nh@xmath3 opacity we compute at a given wavelength is strictly a lower limit to the actual opacity .",
    "except for the collision - induced absorption by h@xmath8 , the most important molecular absorber in gl 229b is h@xmath8o , for which the opacity is now relatively well understood .",
    "we use the most recent and most extensive ab initio line list ( @xcite , @xmath67 transitions ) .",
    "this line list is essentially complete for @xmath68k . as a demonstration of the equality of this database , we find that the h@xmath8o features computed with this line list correspond extremely well in frequency with the observed features of gl 229b ( _ e.g. _ figs . 7 to 9 ) .",
    "however , we find noticeable discrepancies in the relative strengths of h@xmath8o features which we attribute to the calculated oscillator strength of the transitions (  5.1 ) .",
    "this effect can also be seen in fig .",
    "1c of @xcite . at high resolution ,",
    "the distribution of molecular transitions in frequency and strength is nearly random , and the inaccuracies in oscillator strengths we have found limit the accuracy of model fitting in a fashion similar to noise .",
    "this `` opacity noise '' is at least as significant as the noise intrinsic to our data .",
    "we have constructed a grid of synthetic spectra for the three models shown in fig .",
    "4 with metallicity @xmath69 } \\le 0.1 $ ] in steps of 0.1 .",
    "we use these modeled spectra to fit four distinct spectral regions ( the `` red '' , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 spectra ) separately to determine the metallicity as a function of gravity with an internal precision of @xmath70 dex . for the purpose of fitting the data ,",
    "the synthetic spectra were renormalized to the observed flux at a selected wavelength in each spectral region .",
    "the model spectra show some distortions in the overall shape of the spectrum which are probably due to remaining uncertainties in the @xmath71 profile of the atmosphere , the inadequate ch@xmath9 opacities , and possible effects of dust opacity .",
    "considering the additional problems with the strength of the h@xmath8o features , we elected to do all fits `` by eye , '' except where otherwise noted .",
    "we discuss the fitting of each spectral interval below . in the interest of brevity , we present a detailed discussion of fits obtained only with the model of intermediate gravity ( model b ) .",
    "the best fits obtained with models a and c are very nearly identical to those with model b. the results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the `` red '' spectrum extends from 0.83 to @xmath72 m and is formed deep in the atmosphere where @xmath73k .",
    "the spectra of @xcite and @xcite reveal two lines of cs i ( at 0.852 and 0.894@xmath13 m ) and a strong h@xmath8o band but _ not _ the bands of tio and vo common to late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "refractory elements , such as ti , fe , v , ca , and cr , are expected to be bound in condensed compounds in a low - temperature atmosphere such as that of gl 229b and therefore are not available to form molecular bands @xcite . with the exception of the strong , unidentified feature at 0.9874@xmath13 m , all features between 0.89 and 1.0@xmath13",
    "m can be attributed to h@xmath8o .",
    "an overlap of a weak band of h@xmath8o and a weaker ch@xmath9 band causes the small depression at 0.894@xmath13 m which was tentatively tentatively attributed to ch@xmath9 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "features below 0.89@xmath13 m can not be identified at present .",
    "the two cs i lines are not included in our model .",
    "the flux from gl 229b is also observed to decrease very rapidly toward shorter wavelengths @xcite , which , in the absence of the strong tio and vo bands , is evidently caused by the presence of a missing source of opacity in the atmosphere .",
    "spectra computed with molecular opacities only ( but excluding tio , vo , feh , etc ) predict visible fluxes which are grossly overestimated @xcite but the detailed sequence of absorption features of the spectrum are well reproduced , indicating that the short wavelength flux is suppressed by a _",
    "opacity source .",
    "we fit the red spectrum of gl 229b between 0.82 and 1.15@xmath13 m to obtain the metallicity .",
    "we have recalibrated the published spectrum @xcite using the hst photometry of @xcite .",
    "we model the continuum opacity with a layer of condensates following the approach of @xcite .",
    "condensates are expected in the atmosphere of gl 229b on the basis of chemical equilibrium calculations @xcite and can provide the required opacity . alternatively , tsuji , ohnaka & aoki ( 1999 ) and burrows , marley , & sharp ( 1999 ) attribute this rapid decline to the pressure broadened red wing of the 0.77@xmath13 m k i resonance doublet .",
    "the first optical spectrum of a t dwarf ( sdss 1624 + 0029 ) shows that the latter explanation is correct @xcite . the nature of this opacity source is not very important for the determination of the metallicity , however , as long as the proper continuum opacity background is present in the calculation .",
    "the dust opacity is computed with the mie theory of scattering by spherical particles and is determined by the vertical distribution of the particles , their grain size distribution , and the complex index of refraction of the condensate .",
    "the cloud model of @xcite is described by 1 ) the vertical density profile of the condensate , taken as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number density of condensed particles , @xmath76 is the ambient gas pressure , and the cloud layer is bound by @xmath77 2 ) the size distribution of the particles @xmath78 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the diameter of the particles ; and 3 ) the complex index of refraction of the condensate @xmath80 the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , the function @xmath85 , and the metallicity of the atmosphere are free parameters .",
    "such a multi - parameter fit of the observed spectrum is not unique .",
    "furthermore , arbitrarily good fits of the `` continuum '' flux level can be obtained by adjusting the imaginary part of the index of refraction since its wavelength dependence is weakly constrained _ a priori_. our results for the three models are qualitatively similar to those of @xcite .",
    "typical values of the fitted dust parameters are @xmath86@xmath87bar@xmath88 , @xmath89bar , @xmath90 m , and @xmath91 , with the imaginary part of the index of refraction decreasing from @xmath92 at 0.8@xmath13 m to 0.01 at 1.10@xmath13 m .",
    "these parameters applied to model b with a metallicity of [ m / h]=@xmath93 result in the fit shown in figure 7 .",
    "the metallicity of the atmosphere [ m / h ] is largely independent of the dust parameters , however , as it is constrained by the amplitude of the features in the h@xmath8o band which we fit between 0.925 and 0.98@xmath13 m . a larger metallicity results in a larger amplitude of the features inside the band .",
    "we obtain the same value of [ m / h ] as long as a good fit of the `` continuum '' flux level is obtained , regardless of the particular values of dust parameters .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "7 clearly shows differences in the relative strengths of the absorption features in the h@xmath8o band between the synthetic and observed spectra .",
    "similar differences also occur in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands .",
    "the same differences are found for all three atmospheric profiles and point to inaccuracies in the oscillator strength of the ab initio line list of h@xmath8o @xcite .",
    "the metallicity is fitted to give the best overall fit of these features with a precision of @xmath70 dex .",
    "strictly speaking , this procedure gives the h@xmath8o abundance , or [ o / h ] rather than [ m / h ] .",
    "for solar metallicity , the condensation of silicates deep in the atmosphere of gl 229b will reduce the amount of oxygen available to form h@xmath8o by @xmath94% @xcite which implies that @xmath95 } = { \\rm [ o / h ] } + 0.07.\\ ] ] the correction , which decreases for subsolar metallicities , is smaller than our fitting uncertainty and will be ignored hereafter .",
    "the @xmath0 band spectrum probes the most transparent window of the spectrum of gl 229b and is formed at great depth where @xmath96k and @xmath97bar ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "our spectrum contains almost exclusively h@xmath8o features , with the exception of ch@xmath9 absorption for @xmath98 m and of two prominent k i lines ( fig .",
    "since we have elected to ignore ch@xmath9 bands and our synthetic spectra do not include alkali metal lines , we fit the @xmath0 spectrum between 1.215 and 1.298@xmath13 m to determine the metallicity from the depth of the h@xmath8o absorption features .",
    "figure 8 shows the effect of the metallicity on the spectrum ( top panel ) and our best fit ( bottom panel ) for model b. the flux level in the @xmath0 spectrum varies by a factor of 3 and our best fit shows distortions in the general shape of the spectrum .",
    "the distortions may be caused by a combination of uncertainties in the @xmath43 profile of the atmosphere , problems with the h@xmath8o opacities or a small amount of dust opacity in the infrared spectrum of gl 229b ( not modeled ) . since the fit is based on the depth of the features , we ignore these distortions and fit the logarithm of the flux rather than the flux , as shown in fig .",
    "8 . as in the red spectrum (  5.1 )",
    ", we find a remarkable correspondence of spectral features between the observed and modeled spectra although the model spectrum is somewhat less successful at reproducing the relative strengths of the h@xmath8o features .",
    "while the @xmath1 band spectrum falls between the red side of a strong h@xmath8o band ( for @xmath22 m ) and the blue side of a prominent ch@xmath9 band ( for @xmath99 m ) , nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s have non - negligible opacity in this wavelength interval which also includes a band of co.    the strong ch@xmath9 band is responsible for the turnover of the flux at 1.59@xmath13 m . in this wavelength range ,",
    "the ch@xmath9 opacity is described in our calculation by the @xcite laboratory measurements which are restricted to @xmath59k . as a consequence ,",
    "the ch@xmath9 band comes in at 1.61@xmath13 m in the synthetic spectra , which results in strong departures of the mean flux level between data and models for @xmath100 m .",
    "this limits our analysis of the @xmath1 band spectrum to wavelengths shorter than 1.58@xmath13 m . in this wavelength range ,",
    "the spectrum is formed deep in the atmosphere , where @xmath101k and @xmath102 bar ( fig . 6 ) . within this spectral region ,",
    "we determine the abundance of nh@xmath3 as a function of the metallicity , but can not untangle the two .",
    "we also comment on the presence of h@xmath8s and co.      while nh@xmath3 absorption can significantly affect the slope of the spectrum shortward of 1.56@xmath13 m ( fig .",
    "9 ) , there is no distinctive feature at this spectral resolution ( @xmath103 ) to provide an unambiguous detection of this molecule .",
    "the detection of co at 4.7@xmath13 m well above the equilibrium abundance @xcite suggests the possibility that nh@xmath3 may also depart from its chemical equilibrium abundance @xcite .",
    "we therefore vary the abundance of nh@xmath3 by reducing its chemical equilibrium abundance  _ as computed for a given metallicity _  uniformly throughout the atmosphere by constant factor .",
    "we found that reduction factors of 1 , 0.5 , 0.25 , and 0 provide an adequate grid of nh@xmath3 abundances given the s / n ratio of the data and the residual problems with the h@xmath8o opacity .",
    "the effect of varying the metallicity on the @xmath1 band spectrum is shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath2 band spectrum provides a unique opportunity : once the metallicity is determined by matching the depth of the h@xmath8o features between 2.05 and 2.10@xmath13 m , the abundance of nh@xmath3 can be obtained by fitting its features below 2.05@xmath13 m .",

    "the effect of the former can be seen in the trio of features at 2.026 , 2.029 and 2.031@xmath13 m , which overlap h@xmath8o absorption features . even after removing all nh@xmath3 opacity , these features are still too strong in the calculated spectrum ( top panel of fig .",

    "we therefore consider a depletion in nh@xmath3 in the atmosphere of gl 229b at the level probed by the @xmath2 band spectrum .",
    "following the approach used in fitting the @xmath1 band spectrum , we express this depletion as a fraction of the chemical equilibrium abundance of nh@xmath3 for the metallicity obtained independently from the amplitude of the h@xmath8o features in the @xmath2 band .",
    "this fraction is applied uniformly throughout the atmosphere for the computation of the synthetic spectrum .",
    "given the ambiguous presence of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band , we have determined the optimal nh@xmath3 abundance by minimizing the @xmath122 of the spectral fit for @xmath123 m .",
    "this gives a depletion factor of @xmath124 with no nh@xmath3 present being an acceptable fit . restricting the fit to the region where nh@xmath3 features are clearly observed ( @xmath125 )",
    "gives a similar result but favors a finite value for the nh@xmath3 depletion of @xmath126 .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the lower panel of figure 15 shows the model b fit obtained by reducing the nh@xmath3 abundance throughout the atmosphere to @xmath127% of its chemical equilibrium value _ for the adopted metallicity_. with this significant degree of depletion , the model reproduces the three detected features ( 2.033 , 2.037 and 2.046@xmath13 m ) extremely well and makes the 2.041@xmath13 m feature consistent with the observations .    because our nh@xmath3 line list is incomplete at high temperatures , the opacity which we compute is strictly a lower limit to the actual nh@xmath3 opacity at any wavelength .",
    "if the incompleteness is significant for the features found in the @xmath2 band spectrum , then the nh@xmath3 abundance is actually lower still .",
    "it appears extremely unlikely that the errors in the oscillator strength of the h@xmath8o transitions would conspire to mimic the depletion of nh@xmath3 which we find .",
    "for example , if we imagine that there is no nh@xmath3 depletion ( dotted curve in the top panel of fig .",
    "14 ) , the residuals between the data and the fitted spectrum for @xmath120 m would be much larger than the typical mismatch which we find in h@xmath8o features in all four spectra presented here .",
    "we consider the depletion of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band spectrum to be firmly established .",
    "we are not able to establish the presence of h@xmath8s from our @xmath1 band spectrum (  5.3.2 ) . throughout the @xmath2 band ,",
    "the h@xmath8s opacity is generally overwhelmed by h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 absorption .",
    "however , there is a peak in the opacity of h@xmath8s which is about one order of magnitude higher than all other opacity maxima ( fig .",
    "our synthetic spectra indicate that this feature is strong enough to become visible in the midst of the background of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 features .",
    "figure 17 shows the relevant portion of the @xmath2 band spectrum with synthetic spectra for all three models ( a , b , and c ) using the fitted metallicity ( table 2 ) .",
    "all three panels are remarkably similar .",
    "the strength of the predicted feature is well above the noise level of the data , and taken at face value , figure 17 indicates a probable depletion of h@xmath8s by more than a factor of 2 . on the other hand ,",
    "chemical equilibrium calculations indicate that the h@xmath8s abundance should be very near the elemental abundance of sulfur , even in the presence of vertical transport and condensation @xcite .",
    "since there is no reason to expect a significant depletion of h@xmath8s , the discrepancy is probably due to remaining uncertainties in the opacities .",
    "our h@xmath8s line list is based on an ab initio calculation ( r. wattson , priv .",
    "which hasnt been compared to laboratory data in this part of the spectrum .",
    "the strong feature centered at 2.1084@xmath13 m is a blend of three strong lines from three different bands of h@xmath8s .",
    "possible errors in the position or strength of these lines could significantly reduce the amplitude of the feature in our synthetic spectra .",
    "the limitations of the background opacity of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 may also be responsible for the observed mismatch .",
    "nevertheless , it is desirable to look for this feature at a higher resolution and a higher s / n ratio as an absence of sulfur in gl 229b would be a most intriguing result .      given our determination of @xmath14 and [ m / h ] in terms of the surface gravity , we can obtain the abundance of co from the 45@xmath13 m spectra of @xcite and @xcite which is consistent with our results .",
    "for each model  a , b , and c  and using the metallicity given in table 2 , we computed synthetic spectra with various co abundances .",
    "the latter is varied freely without imposing stoichiometric constraints .",
    "the synthetic spectra are binned to the wavelength grid of the data and fitted to the data by a normalization factor adjusted to minimize the @xmath122 .",
    "the @xmath122 of the fitted spectra shows a well - defined minimum as a function of the co abundance , @xmath108 ( table 3 ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the co abundance is obtained by generating synthetic data sets by adding a gaussian distribution of the observed noise to the best fitting model spectrum . after doing the same analysis on 1000 synthetic data sets ,",
    "we obtain a ( non - gaussian ) distribution of values of @xmath108 .",
    "the uncertainties given in table 3 correspond to the 68% confidence level .",
    "the @xcite spectrum gives co abundances which are 0.1 dex higher than those obtained from the @xcite spectrum ; which is well within the fitting uncertainty .",
    "@xcite found a co mole fraction of 50 to 200 ppm ( @xmath128 ) by assuming a h@xmath8o abundance of 300 ppm ( effectively , [ m / h]@xmath129 ) , which agrees well with our result for model a which has [ m / h]@xmath130 .",
    "our results are also consistent with those of @xcite who find co abundances of @xmath131 and @xmath132 ppm ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) for [ m / h]=@xmath135 and 0 , respectively , using the data of @xcite .",
    "since this part of the spectrum contains only h@xmath8o and co features , our fitting procedure is sensitive only to the co to h@xmath8o abundance ratio .",
    "chemical equilibrium calculations show that the h@xmath8o abundance scales linearly with the metallicity at the level probed with 45@xmath13 m spectroscopy ( _ i.e. _ all the gas phase oxygen is in h@xmath8o ) .",
    "accordingly , the co abundance we find scales with the metallicity of the model .",
    "as shown in figure 18 , the co abundance determined from the 4.7@xmath13 m band corresponds approximately to the co / ch@xmath9 transition in chemical equilibrium .",
    "the observations definitely exclude the very - low chemical equilibrium abundance of co. the fact that the extreme case where all carbon is co provides an acceptable fit to the data ( while we know that a good fraction of the carbon is in ch@xmath9 ) is due to the rather noisy spectra .",
    "it is highly desirable to restrict the surface gravity @xmath27 of gl 229b to an astrophysically useful range .",
    "since @xmath33 is known , a determination of @xmath27 fixes @xmath14 , the radius , the mass , and the age of gl 229b ( fig .",
    "4 ) , as well as the metallicity and the abundances of important molecules such as co and nh@xmath3 . the large uncertainty on @xmath27 results in a large uncertainty in the mass of gl 229b and on the age of the system determined from cooling tracks .",
    "while a dynamical determination of the mass may be possible in a decade or so @xcite , a spectroscopic determination might be obtained much sooner .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to constrain the gravity better than @xmath136 with the data and models presently available .",
    "our high resolution spectroscopy does not allow us to choose between models a , b and c ( table 2 ) as an increase in gravity can be compensated by an increase in metallicity to lead to an identical fit .",
    "the gravity sensitivity of the @xmath2 band synthetic spectrum models reported by @xcite occurs for a fixed metallicity only .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite report that the spectral energy distribution of gl 229b models is fairly sensitive to the gravity .",
    "but this is true only for a fixed metallicity . for the three models indicated in fig . 4 , and using the metallicity we have determined for each ( table 2 ) the gravity dependence of the infrared colors is @xmath137 and @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( table 4 ) .",
    "this dependence is very weak in the light of the uncertainty in the photometry of gl 229b .",
    "more problematic is the fact that the synthetic @xmath140 disagrees with the photometry .",
    "furthermore , the incomplete ch@xmath9 opacities used in the spectrum calculation almost certainly result in an inaccurate redistribution of the flux in the near infrared opacity windows which determines the broad band colors .",
    "an example of this effect on the @xmath1 band flux can be seen in fig .",
    "we conclude that a photometric determination of the gravity is not possible at present .",
    "an alternative approach to determining the gravity of gl 229b is through a study of the pressure - broadened molecular lines of its spectrum .",

    "ammonia is a relatively fragile molecule which is easily dissociated by uv photons : @xmath175 with a photodissociation cross section of @xmath176cm@xmath164 per molecule , optical depth unity for the photodissociation of nh@xmath3 is reached at pressures of a few millibars in gl 229b .",
    "photodissociation of the much more abundant h@xmath8 molecules does not effectively shield nh@xmath3 from incoming uv photons since the two molecules absorb over different wavelength ranges .",
    "photodissociation of nh@xmath3 therefore represents a net sink of nh@xmath3 which occurs at the very top of the atmosphere .",
    "we can estimate a lower limit to the time scale of photodissociation of nh@xmath3 by assuming that each photodissociating photon results in the destruction of a nh@xmath3 molecule .",
    "the incident photon flux is @xmath178 where photons causing dissociation of nh@xmath3 are between @xmath179 and @xmath180 , @xmath181 is the flux at the surface of the primary star , @xmath182 the radius of the primary star and @xmath79 the separation of the binary system . for nh@xmath3",
    ", we have @xmath183  and @xmath184  ( moses , priv . comm . ) .",
    "the primary star has a dm1 spectral type , with @xmath185erg@xmath10@xmath186s@xmath88@xmath46 and @xmath187 cm @xcite .",
    "the binary separation is @xmath188au @xcite .",
    "this results in @xmath189@xmath186s@xmath88 .",
    "photodissociation will affect significantly the nh@xmath3 abundance when @xmath190 where @xmath84 is the column density of nh@xmath3 . because the incident flux of uv photons is fairly low ,",
    "this condition is satisfied only at pressures below a few microbars , _ i.e. _ very high in the atmosphere . in the region of interest",
    ", photodissociation destroys a very small fraction of nh@xmath3 during one mixing time scale and therefore has little effect on the abundance of nh@xmath3 .",
    "photolysis of nh@xmath3 can not explain the relatively low nh@xmath3 abundance we find in the @xmath2 band spectrum .",
    "we believe that the difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band determinations of the nh@xmath3 abundance arise from the limitations of the nh@xmath3 opacity data used for the calculation of the synthetic spectra . as discussed above , the incompleteness of the nh@xmath3 line list for @xmath66k results in upper limits for the nh@xmath3 abundances obtained by fitting the data .",
    "since this effect increases with temperature , we expect that the abundance determined from the @xmath1 band spectrum is overestimated relative to the one obtained from the @xmath2 band spectrum , which is what we observe .",
    "until nh@xmath3 opacities become available for @xmath191  1200@xmath10k , we will not be able to quantify this effect .",
    "figures 6 and 18 show that ammonia offers a third window of opportunity for a determination of its abundance .",
    "the region between 8.3 and 14.4@xmath13 m is rich in strong nh@xmath3 features , the two strongest being at 10.35 and 10.75@xmath13 m ( fig .",
    "this spectral region probes a higher level in the atmosphere ( @xmath192k ) where the hot bands of nh@xmath3 which are missing from opacity data bases are less problematic than in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands . in this spectral region ,",
    "the spectrum is very sensitive to the nh@xmath3/h@xmath8o ratio , especially for nh@xmath3 abundances below 25% of the equilibrium value ( fig .",
    "this would allow a good determination of the degree of nh@xmath3 depletion in the upper levels of the atmosphere .",
    "we anticipate that 10@xmath13 m spectroscopy should reveal a nh@xmath3 abundance of @xmath193% of its equilibrium value .",
    "with the availability of extensive photometric , astrometric , and spectroscopic data , our picture of the atmosphere of gl 229b is gradually becoming more exotic and more complex .",
    "the initial discovery of ch@xmath9 in its spectrum set it appart and has prompted the creation of a new spectral class , the t dwarfs .",
    "h@xmath8o , co , cs i , and k i have also been detected .",
    "there is good evidence that the rapid decrease of the flux at visible wavelengths is caused by unprecedently broad lines of atomic alkali metals @xcite .",
    "the presence of condensates may also play a role in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b .",
    "it is unfortunate that the surface gravity of gl 229b remains poorly constrained .",
    "we have not been able to further restrict the allowed range with our new @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 spectroscopy . as a result ,",
    "all our results are expressed as a function of gravity .",
    "this is the most significant obstacle to further progress in elucidating the astrophysics of this t dwarf .",
    "the surface gravity can probably be determined from the study of the pressure broadened shape of molecular lines .",
    "we have found good evidence for the presence of nh@xmath3 in the spectrum of gl 229b , which was expected from chemical equilibrium calculations .",
    "we have been able to determine its abundance at two different levels in the atmosphere , and we find a significant deviation from chemical equilibrium .",
    "a similar situation has been found with co previously @xcite and this abundance pattern can be explained by vertical mixing in the atmosphere .",
    "the extent of the convection zone is not sufficient to account for the abundances we find and the mixing may be due to overshooting or to less efficient eddy diffusion . we find that nh@xmath3 photolysis is not important in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b . because nh@xmath3 can be observed in three different bands corresponding to three distinct depths in the atmosphere , an accurate determination of its abundance in each band provides information on the time scale of mixing as a function of depth .",
    "this is an unusual and powerful diagnostic tool which can provide valuable clues for modeling the vertical distributions of possible condensates . in principle , any absorber with a large abundance gradient through the visible part of the atmosphere can be used to infer the details of the mixing process . among detected and abundant molecules , only co and nh@xmath3",
    "satisfy this criterion .",
    "chemical equilibrium calculations with rainout of condensates @xcite show that we can expect significant vertical gradients in the abundances of atomic k , rb , cs , and na as they become bound in molecules ( kcl , rbcl , cscl and na@xmath8s , respectively ) in the cooler , upper reaches of the atmosphere .",
    "cesium and potassium have been detected in the spectrum of gl 229b , and resonance doublets of k",
    "i and na i appear to shape the visible spectrum .",
    "however , the chemical timescales for alkali metals are so short that they should always remain in thermodynamic equilibrium ( lodders 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , they can not serve as probes of vertical mixing in gl 229b .",
    "further progress in understanding the atmosphere of gl 229b requires better opacities for ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 , and , to a lesser extent , of h@xmath8o .",
    "a more accurate determination of the co abundance from 4  5@xmath13 m spectroscopy is very desirable and will require higher signal - to - noise spectroscopy than is currently available .",
    "similarly , 10@xmath13 m spectroscopy to determine the nh@xmath3 abundance for @xmath194bar , while difficult , is important .",
    "the issue of vertical mixing and departures from chemical equilibrium gains importance when we consider that the observed departure of co from chemical equilibrium implies a significantly reduced ch@xmath9 abundance , by conservation of the abundance of elemental carbon .",
    "similarly , our results imply that nh@xmath3 absorption in the 10@xmath13 m region is reduced .",
    "because ch@xmath9 is a significant absorber in the near infrared , as is nh@xmath3 in the 10@xmath13 m range , departures from equilibrium must be taken into account when accurate modeling of the atmosphere and spectrum of gl 229b is desired .",
    "this new level of complexity compounds the exoticism and the challenges posed by t dwarfs .",
    "the astrophysics of gl 229b is far richer than has been originally anticipated .",
    "gl 229b is currently the only t dwarf known to be in a binary system .",
    "there is no evidence that the illumination from the primary star has a significant effect on the state of its atmosphere and gl 229b is most likely typical of isolated t dwarfs .",
    "it remains the brightest and by far the best studied of the seven t dwarfs currently known , but the list should expand to several dozens during the next 2  3 years @xcite .",
    "the existing body of work on gl 229b points to the most rewarding observations to conduct on t dwarfs .",
    "the possibility of studying trends in the physics of t dwarf atmospheres as a function of effective temperature is a fascinating prospect .",
    "we thank t. guillot for sharing programs which were most useful to our analysis , j. moses for invaluable information regarding the photolysis of nh@xmath3 in giant planets , and k. noll and b. oppenheimer for sharing their data .",
