    "we recall that eckart @xcite was the first to discuss relativistic dissipative fluids in a proper way . the energy - momentum tensor decomposition proposed by him",
    "contained no bulk viscous pressure , @xmath144 , and no particle diffusion current , @xmath145 , hence the fluid dynamical flow velocity was fixed to the conserved particles , @xmath146 .",
    "moreover the energy - momentum current in this case was identified with the heat - flow , @xmath147 .",
    "later landau and lifshitz @xcite introduced a different decomposition where the flow is tied to the flow of energy - momentum @xmath148 .",
    "this defines the flow as the only time - like eigenvector of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "therefore the energy - momentum diffusion current vanishes , @xmath149 , in this frame .",
    "these physically different choices are related by the general expression for the heat - flow @xmath150 .",
    "here we showed that using the nebe we obtain formally the same results as in the case of the classical boltzmann equation , but they are generalized to include the non - extensivity of entropy .",
    "since the equations of dissipative fluid dynamics are not closed due to the fact that @xmath127 is unknown , we need to find additional equations and relations which close the system of equations .",
    "let us assume , following chapman and enskog @xcite , that the non - equilibrium contributions from the streaming term are negligible near the equilibrium @xmath151 @xmath140 , that is @xmath152 . in this way",
    "@xmath153 @xmath154 and therefore all non - equilibrium moments vanish from the left hand side of the transport equation .",
    "hence we obtain the gradients of thermodynamic quantities multiplied by transport coefficients .",
    "we calculate the streaming term in @xmath1-equilibrium , @xmath155 from here we follow the pioneering works of anderson and witting @xcite and employ the relaxation time approximation .",
    "this simplifies the collision integral of the nebe , @xmath156 \\simeq -e_{k}\\frac{\\left ( \\tilde{f}_{k}-\\tilde{f}% _ { 0k}\\right ) } { \\tau _ { c } } ,   \\label{coll_int}\\]]where @xmath157 is the relaxation time .",

    "furthermore , this approximation fixes the local rest frame so that the energy flow vanishes , as it will be shown below .",
    "note that these approximations are made in order to simplify the collision term , which in the nebe is even more complicated than in the classical case .",
    "nevertheless , these model equations and solutions can be used to make very reasonable first estimates for the transport coefficients .    replacing @xmath158 into the nebe and using the previous assumptions we get the following transport equation",

    "it is about @xmath220 times smaller than the coefficient of shear viscosity @xmath221 , which corroborates the classical result that the bulk viscosity in the non - relativistic or ultra - relativistic massless limit vanishes , while it is much smaller than the shear viscosity in between for massive particles @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio does show a monotonic increase with increasing @xmath1 but only for @xmath222 .",
    "for @xmath223 the behaviour is reversed due to the fact that the entropy density increases with temperature at a slower rate compared to the viscosity .",
