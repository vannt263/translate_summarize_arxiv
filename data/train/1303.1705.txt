    "as is known , one of the most attractive features of the ordinary kerr spacetime , which describes a family of rotating black holes in general relativity ( gr ) , is its separability structure .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation for geodesics admits a complete separation of variables @xcite , despite the fact that the spacetime possesses only two global isometries generated by two commuting killing vector fields .",
    "clearly , the separability structure implies an extra integral of motion that in turn signals the existence of hidden symmetries in the spacetime .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed that this is indeed the case .",
    "the kerr spacetime possesses hidden symmetries generated by a second rank symmetric killing tensor , rendering the hamilton - jacobi equation for geodesics completely integrable .",
    "moreover , the kerr spacetime provides full quantum separability in both the klein - gordon equation @xcite and the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "while the existence of the killing tensor plays a crucial role for the separability of the klein - gordon equation , the situation with the dirac equation is more subtle .",
    "in addition to the killing tensor , the kerr spacetime also admits a second rank antisymmetric killing - yano tensor which can be thought of as a  square root \" of the killing tensor @xcite .",
    "it is the killing - yano tensor that lies behind the separability of the dirac equation in the kerr background @xcite .",
    "thus , in a sense , the usual ",
    "square root \" relationship between the dirac and klein - gordon equations turns out to be echoed in the structure of hidden symmetries of the kerr spacetime .    in recent years",
    ", there has been an active interest in hidden symmetries of higher - dimensional black hole spacetimes . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the spacetime of higher - dimensional rotating black holes given by the myers - perry metric @xcite , which generalizes the kerr metric to all higher dimensions , admits both the killing and killing - yano tensors .",
    "in other words , the hidden symmetries of the kerr spacetime survive for the myers - perry spacetime in higher dimensions as well . to gain some insight into the origin of hidden symmetries generated by the killing - yano tensor",
    ", the authors of @xcite managed to relate them to a new kind of _ supersymmetry _ , appearing in the worldline supersymmetric mechanics of spinning point particles in the kerr background . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that similar analysis based on the viewpoint of worldline supersymmetric mechanics also remains true for the higher - dimensional spacetime of the myers - perry black holes .",
    "the hidden symmetries of general rotating charged black holes in five - dimensional minimal gauged supergravity @xcite as well as various black hole solutions of supergravity and string theories have been studied in a number of works ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "intriguing generalizations of the kerr spacetime have also been studied in kaluza - klein theory . in a relatively simple setting ,",
    "the kerr solution in kaluza - klein theory describes a rotating black hole in four dimensions from the kaluza - klein point of view and involves the signature of an extra dimension .",
    "this shows up through the appearance of the electric and dilaton charges , though the dilaton charge is not an independent parameter .",
    "that is , the solution satisfies the coupled einstein - maxwell - dilaton field equations , which are obtained from the kaluza - klein reduction of einstein gravity in five dimensions .",
    "the procedure of obtaining such a solution is well known @xcite and amounts to boosting a four - dimensional  seed \" solution under consideration in the fifth dimension with a subsequent kaluza - klein reduction to four dimensions . the most general solution for rotating black holes in kaluza - klein theory was obtained in @xcite by employing a solution generation technique based on the use of hidden symmetries of the einstein field equations .",
    "recently , intriguing developments have also been towards exploring the physical effects of black holes in four and higher dimensions .",
    "observations of rapidly rotating black holes ( with the angular momenta approaching the kerr bound in gr ) in some x - ray binaries @xcite have sparked the old theoretical question of _ bona fide spacetime geometry _ around the black holes . in light of this , many investigators have studied gravitational effects of black holes both in gr and beyond it , focusing in some cases on the imprints of the extra dimension in our physical world ( for instance , see refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is two - fold : firstly , we examine the separability structure and the hidden symmetries of the rotating black hole in the kaluza - klein framework ( the kerr - kaluza - klein black hole ) , where it carries the imprint of the extra fifth dimension through the electric and dilaton charges .",
    "we consider the hamilton - jacobi equation for a massive ( uncharged ) particle in the background of this black hole and show that the complete separation of variables occurs only for the vanishing mass of the particle , in contrast to the case of the original kerr black hole in gr .",
    "this implies that the black hole spacetime under consideration possesses hidden symmetries generated by a second rank conformal killing tensor .",
    "next , we construct the explicit form for the conformal killing tensor by employing a nice procedure built up on an effective metric , which is conformally related to the original spacetime metric and admits the separability structure due to the killing tensor .",
    "such a procedure of constructing the conformal killing tensor was earlier used in @xcite as well .",
    "secondly , we explore the geodesic motion of the uncharged massive particle in the equatorial plane of the kerr - kaluza - klein black hole . using the hamilton - jacobi and geodesic equations , we study the effects of the extra fifth dimension on the properties of the circular motion around this black hole .",
    "we show that the extra dimension has its greatest effect in enlarging the regions of existence , boundedness and stability of the circular motion towards the event horizon , regardless of the classes of orbits .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec.ii we describe a theoretical framework for the kerr - kaluza - klein black hole .",
    "this includes a brief recalling the construction of the pertaining spacetime metric , the description of its physical properties as well as the properties of the hamilton - jacobi equation in this spacetime .",
    "in sec.iii we introduce a procedure that builds up on the use of an effective metric , conformally related to the original spacetime metric and admitting the killing tensor . here",
    "we show that such a procedure enables one to construct the conformal killing tensor for the kerr - kaluza - klein spacetime under consideration .",
    "in sec.iv we study the properties of the circular and quasicircular ( epicyclic ) motions in the equatorial plane of both static and rotating kaluza - klein black holes . in both cases ,",
    "we present defining equations for the boundaries of the existence regions as well as for the boundaries of the regions of boundedness and stability of the circular motion . here",
    "we also present the results of a detailed numerical analysis of these equations .",
    "next , using the general theory of the epicyclic motion , earlier developed in @xcite , we give the analytical expressions for the orbital , radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies and perform the numerical analysis of these expressions . in sec.v",
    "we conclude with the discussion of our results .",
    "we begin by recalling briefly the construction of the exact solution that represents a rotating black hole in kaluza - klein theory , namely the kerr - kaluza - klein black hole with the maxwell and dilaton fields .",
    "the details of the construction can be found in the original paper @xcite as well as in a recent paper @xcite , including a nut parameter as well . at the first step ,",
    "the procedure of obtaining this solution amounts to adding an extra spacelike flat dimension to the usual kerr solution of four - dimensional gr .",
    "thus , in the boyer - lindquist coordinates we have the five - dimensional metric given by @xmath0 ^ 2 + dy^2 , \\label{5kerr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 determine the mass and the angular momentum of the solution .",
    "next , one needs to boost this metric in the fifth dimension by @xmath4 y & \\rightarrow &   y \\cosh\\alpha + t \\sinh\\alpha\\ , , \\label{boost}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and with the velocity of the boost @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , the boosted metric will satisfy the vacuum equations of five - dimensional gr . putting this metric into the standard kaluza - klein form @xmath6 we compactify the extra fifth dimension , identifying the four - dimensional metric @xmath7 & & + \\,\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{b \\sigma } \\left[a dt - \\left(r^2+a^2\\right)\\cosh\\alpha\\ , d\\phi\\ , \\right]^2 ,   \\label{solution2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the associated potential one - form @xmath8 and the dilaton field @xmath9 , which are given by @xmath10 here we have used the notation @xmath11",
    "we see that for the vanishing boost velocity , @xmath12 , the maxwell and dilaton fields vanish and the metric in ( [ solution2 ] ) reduces to the original kerr solution .",
    "it is straightforward to check that solution ( [ solution2 ] ) , accompanied with the maxwell and dilaton fields given in ( [ potform1 ] ) , satisfies the equation of motion derived from the four - dimensional action of kaluza - klein theory @xmath13 , \\label{4d action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 .",
    "we recall that this action is obtained from the five - dimensional einstein action for the metric in the form given by ( [ kkmetric ] ) .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the spacetime in ( [ solution2 ] ) admits two commuting killing vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which reflect its time - translational and rotational invariance . calculating the various scalar products of these vectors ,",
    "we arrive at the metric components in the form @xmath17 { \\bf \\xi}_{(t ) } \\cdot { \\bf \\xi}_{(\\phi)}&= & g_{03}= -\\ , \\frac{2 m r a \\sin^2 \\theta}{b \\sigma}\\,\\cosh\\alpha\\,,\\nonumber \\\\[3 mm ] { \\bf \\xi}_{(\\phi ) } \\cdot { \\bf \\xi}_{(\\phi)}&= & g_{33}= \\,\\left(r^2+a^2 + \\frac{2 m r a^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{b^2 \\sigma } \\right ) b \\sin^2 \\theta \\ , .",
    "\\label{killproduct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , as follows from metric ( [ solution2 ] ) , the boosting and dimensional reduction procedures do not change the location of the event horizon .",
    "it is still determined by the largest root of the equation @xmath18 , which is given by @xmath19 implying that the horizon exists provided that @xmath20 . as for the physical parameters of the metric , the total mass , angular momentum and the total electric charge ,",
    "they can be determined by evaluating the corresponding komar integrals and the flux integral over a @xmath21-sphere at spatial infinity , respectively .",
    "this has been done in works @xcite .",
    "writing these parameters in terms of the boost velocity @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 it should be noted that the dilaton charge is not independent as it can be expressed in terms of the other parameters @xcite . clearly , the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath24 implies the vanishing of the  seed \" ( unboosted ) mass @xmath2 as well , thus keeping the physical mass @xmath25 fixed .",
    "another important feature of spacetime ( [ solution2 ] ) arises from its dragging properties , which can easily be understood by introducing a family of locally nonrotating observers .",
    "these observers move on orbits with constant @xmath26 and @xmath27 and with a four - velocity @xmath28 , obeying the condition @xmath29 . from this condition",
    ", we find that the coordinate angular velocity of these observers is given by @xmath30 at large distances , we have the following expansion for the angular velocity @xmath31 which reveals _ the dragging property _ of metric ( [ solution2 ] ) in the @xmath32-direction , vanishing at spatial infinity .",
    "this expansion also confirms the physical angular momentum of the metric , given in ( [ mjq1 ] ) . meanwhile , as follows from equation ( [ angvelocity ] ) , towards the event horizon the angular velocity increases , approaching its constant value at @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath34 it is not difficult to show that the corotating killing vector defined as @xmath35 is tangent to the null surface of the horizon .",
    "that is , the quantity @xmath36 is nothing but the angular velocity of the horizon .",
    "we note that the angular velocity of the extreme horizon , @xmath37 , diverges in the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath24 as the horizon radius in this limit shrinks to zero , by equations ( [ horizon1 ] ) and ( [ mjq1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the following we will focus only on the physically acceptable values of the boost velocity , i.e. on those obeying the condition @xmath38 .    in summary , the spacetime metric in ( [ solution2 ] )",
    "generalizes the kerr solution of general relativity to include the signature of the extra fifth dimension that in four dimensions shows up through the appearance of the maxwell and dilaton fields . in other words",
    ", it describes a rotating black hole from the kaluza - klein point of view , whose physical properties were briefly described above .",
    "let us now consider the geodesic motion of a massive ( uncharged ) particle in spacetime ( [ solution2 ] ) of the kerr - kaluza - klein black hole .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation governing the geodesic motion is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an affine parameter .",
    "since the spacetime under consideration possesses two commuting timelike and spacelike killing vectors , one can assume that the action @xmath41 admits the following representation @xmath42 here @xmath43 is an arbitrary function of two variables , the constants of motion correspond to the mass @xmath44 , energy @xmath45 and to the angular momentum @xmath46 of the particle .",
    "we have seen that one of the salient features of the spacetime metric in ( [ solution2 ] ) is that it does not allow for the complete separation of variables in the hamilton - jacobi equation for massive particles .",
    "interpreting this fact in terms of pertinent hidden symmetries , one concludes that the spacetime does not admit hidden symmetries , which are generated by a second rank symmetric killing tensor @xmath52 , in contrast to the original kerr spacetime .",
    "we recall that the killing tensor obeys the equation @xmath53 where the operator @xmath54 denotes the covariant differentiation and the round brackets stand for symmetrization over the indices enclosed .",
    "let us now assume that such a killing tensor exists for an effective metric @xmath55 , which is conformally related to the original metric @xmath56 in ( [ solution2 ] ) as follows @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a smooth scalar function .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the associated christoffel symbols @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the metrics @xmath61 and @xmath56 , respectively , are related as @xmath62 meanwhile , for the covariant derivatives of a second rank symmetric tensor @xmath63 we find the relation @xmath64 where @xmath65 and the operator @xmath66 denotes covariant differentiation with respect to the metric @xmath61 , the comma stands for the partial derivative .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that for the tensor @xmath67 defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the killing tensor in the metric @xmath70 , equation ( [ condeq ] ) reduces to the form @xmath71 in which we recognize the defining equation for the conformal killing tensor @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that for the one - form @xmath72 being exact , the conformal killing tensor goes over into the killing tensor ( see equation ( [ kteq ] ) ) , implying the representation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a scalar function .    with all this in mind",
    ", we turn now to the effective metric @xmath70 in ( [ confmet ] ) . choosing the function @xmath58 in the form @xmath75",
    "we see that the hamilton - jacobi equation in the effective metric admits a complete separation of variables .",
    "in other words , in this case under consideration the factor @xmath50 on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) disappears and the resulting equation allows for separation in the @xmath26 and @xmath49 variables .",
    "thus , for the action @xmath41 in the form @xmath76 we arrive at two independent ordinary differential equations @xmath77 ^ 2 + r^2 \\left(m^2 + \\sinh^2\\alpha\\ ,",

    "it is evident that the separability occurs due to the existence of the new quadratic integral of motion @xmath79 , which is guaranteed by the existence of the irreducible killing tensor @xmath80 in the effective metric @xmath70 , thereby confirming our assumption made above .",

    "a detailed numerical analysis of expression ( [ vf2 ] ) shows that it is always nonnegative in the regions of existence and radial stability of the circular motion . in other words ,",
    "the circular motion is stable with respect to small perturbations in the vertical direction . in figure 5",
    "we plot the vertical epicyclic frequency as a function of the radii of direct orbits in the field of an extreme kerr - kaluza - klein black hole .     for given values of the boost velocity.,width=377 ]",
    "we note that for the direct motion , the vertical epicyclic frequency attains its highest value in the near - horizon region .",
    "again , the growth of the boost velocity results in moving the location of the maxima towards the event horizon , thereby significantly increasing the maximum value of the vertical epicyclic frequency .",
    "it is also interesting that the location of the maxima lies in the region of the radial stability of the motion .",
    "for instance , solving the equation @xmath193 numerically , we find that for @xmath175 and @xmath194 , the location of the maxima is given by @xmath195 , which is greater than the radius of the pertaining innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "to conclude this subsection , we wish to calculate the binding energies of the innermost stable circular orbits in the field of the extreme kerr - kaluza - klein black hole , for both direct and retrograde motions .",
    "using expression ( [ energy2 ] ) and performing some numerical calculations , with equation ( [ orbitfreq2 ] ) in mind , we find that for the direct motion @xmath196 in contrast to the binding energy @xmath197 of a particle in the kerr field with @xmath198 and @xmath199 . similarly , for the retrograde motion we obtain that @xmath200 while in the kerr field with @xmath201 and @xmath202 , we have @xmath203 .",
    "thus , our analysis shows that the rotating kaluza - klein black holes are more energetic objects , compared to the original kerr black holes , in the sense of the potential energy - release process in their vicinity .",
    "the remarkable property of rotating black holes in kaluza - klein theory is that they involve the imprint of the extra dimension through the appearance of additional charges in the spacetime metric . in the most simple setting , it is the kerr spacetime that from the kaluza - klein point of view carries the signature of the extra fifth dimension by acquiring the electric and dilaton charges . in this paper , we have examined the separability structure of the hamilton - jacobi equation for geodesics and the pertaining hidden symmetries in the spacetime of the kerr - kaluza - klein black hole .",
    "we have shown that in the general case of massive geodesics , the hamilton - jacobi equation does not admit the complete separation of variables , whereas such a separability occurs for massless geodesics .",
    "this fact implies the existence of hidden symmetries in the spacetime , which are generated by a second rank conformal killing tensor .",
    "next , we have employed a simple framework based on the effective metric which has the following properties : ( i ) it is conformally related to the original spacetime metric under consideration , ( ii ) it admits the killing tensor , rendering the associated hamilton - jacobi equation for massive geodesics completely separable . with this framework , we have constructed the explicit expression for the conformal killing tensor .",
    "we have also examined the properties of the geodesic motion in the equatorial plane of the kerr - kaluza - klein black holes , using the frameworks of both the hamilton - jacobi and geodesic equations . in order to make the description more transparent ,",
    "we have considered the cases of static and rotating black holes separately . for both cases , we have obtained the analytical expressions for the energy and angular momentum / orbital frequency of the circular motion as well as we have derived the defining equations for the boundaries of the regions of existence , boundedness and stability of the motion . in order to gain some simplifying advantages , we have also invoked the description of the geodesic motion in terms of three fundamental frequencies : the orbital frequency , the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies and we have obtained the associated analytical expressions for these frequencies .",
    "next , applying a numerical analysis , we have found that the greatest effect of the extra fifth dimension amounts to the significant enlarging of the regions of existence , boundedness and stability towards the event horizon , regardless of the classes of orbits .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that for the large enough values of the boost velocity , the locations of the maxima of the epicyclic frequencies essentially shift towards the event horizon , thereby resulting in much greater values of these frequencies , compared to those for the original schwarzschild / kerr black holes , respectively .",
    "finally , we have explored the binding energy of the innermost stable circular orbits for both the static and rotating kaluza - klein black holes .",
    "it is interesting that for these black holes the energy - release process in their vicinity turns out to be potentially much more efficient than for the ordinary schwarzshild and kerr black holes of general relativity .",
    "it should be emphasized that throughout the paper we have focused on the physical aspects of our description . of course",
    ", it would also be of interest to explore possible astrophysical implications of our results , especially in the context of high frequency quasiperiodic oscillations observed in some black hole binaries .",
