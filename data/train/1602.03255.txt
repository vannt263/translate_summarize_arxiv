    "this article is a brief survey on rough path theory , in particular , on its probabilistic aspects . in the first half ,",
    "we summarize basic results in the deterministic part of the theory .",
    "the most important among them are odes in rough path sense . in the latter half",
    ", we discuss several important probabilistic results in the theory .",
    "though putting them all in a short article like this is not so easy , we believe it is worth trying because of importance and potential of rough path theory .    in 1998",
    "t. lyons @xcite invented rough path theory and then he wrote a book @xcite with z. qian which contains early results on rough paths .",
    "this book is splendid mathematically .",
    "however , because of minor errors and its very general setting , this book is not so readable . therefore , it was not easy to learn this theory for non - experts who wanted to enter this research area .",
    "( a few other books were published after that and the situation has changed .",
    "see lyons , caruana and levy @xcite , friz and victoir @xcite , friz and hairer @xcite . ) unlike in these thick standard books , in this article we will try to give a brief overview of rough path theory without computations and proofs so that the reader could grasp what the theory is all about .",
    "a sample path of brownian motion is an important example of continuous paths in probability theory , but its behavior is quite bad . in this theory , which has one of its roots in k. t. chen s theory of iterated path integrals , ( objects corresponding to ) iterated integrals of such bad paths are considered . as a result , line integrals along a path or ordinary differential equations ( odes ) driven by a path are generalized .",
    "this , in turn , makes pathwise study of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) possible . in other words ,",
    "t. lyons successfully `` de - randomized '' the sde theory .",
    "in particular , he proved that a solution to an sde , as a functional of driving brownian motion , becomes continuous . from the viewpoint of the standard sde theory in which the martingale integration theory is crucially used ,",
    "this is quite surprising .",
    "the sde theory is very important and and has been a central topic in probability theory without exaggeration . since it has a long history and has been intensively and extensively studied by so many researchers , this research area looked somewhat mature and some experts may have had a feeling that no big progress would be made when rough path theory was invented .",
    "rough path theory looks at sdes from a very different angle and we believe that it is breaking through the above - mentioned situation . the number of researchers were not large , but it started to increase around 2010 as well as the number of papers .",
    "in retrospect , this was probably when rough path theory really `` took off . ''",
    "since this research area is still young , there will probably be many chances left for newcomers .",
    "indeed , we still saw unexpected developments recently , which indicates that the theory is quite active and has large potential .",
    "the purpose of this article is to give a bird s eye view of the rough path world to those who wants to enter it and to everyone who is interested in the theory , too .",
    "though rough path theory is rapidly developing , the population of researchers are not very large . even among probabilists ,",
    "not so many seem to understand the outline of the theory . therefore , our aim of this section is to give a heuristic explanation on what the theory is all about .",
    "the contents of this section are not intended to be rigorous and small matters are left aside .",
    "let us start with an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) driven by a path .",
    "this type of ode is usually called a driven ode or a controlled ode .",
    "let @xmath0 \\to { \\mathbf r}^d$ ] be a `` sufficiently nice '' path that starts at the origin .",
    "( in this article all paths are continuous ) .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be sufficiently nice functions , where @xmath3 stands for the set of @xmath4 real matrices . consider the following ode driven by the path @xmath5 : @xmath6 this is slightly informal and its precise definition should be given by the following integral equation : @xmath7 when there exists a unique solution , @xmath8 can be regarded as a function ( or a map ) of @xmath5 . using the terminology of probability theory , we call it the it map . it is a map from one path space to another",
    ". we will assume for simplicity that @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( because we can take the space - time path @xmath11 and a block matrix @xmath12 $ ] of size @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , we will consider @xmath14 from now on .",
    "whether ode ( [ eq.xode1 ] ) makes sense or not depends on well - definedness of the line integral on the right hand side .",
    "if it is well - defined , then under a suitable condition on the regularity of the coefficient matrix @xmath15 , we can usually obtain a ( time-)local unique solution .",
    "the most typical method is picard s iteration on a shrunk time interval .",
    "note that for a generic continuous path , the line integral can not be defined",
    ". a stronger condition on @xmath5 is needed .",
    "for instance , for a piecewise @xmath16 path @xmath5 , the line integral clearly makes sense since @xmath17 .",
    "a more advanced example could be a path of bounded variation . in this case , the integral can be understood in the riemann - stieltjes sense and ode ( [ eq.xode1 ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "moreover , if the path spaces are equipped with the bounded variation norm , then line integrals and it maps become continuous as maps between path spaces .",
    "these are basically within an advanced course of calculus and not so difficult .",
    "less widely known is the young integral , which is essentially a generalized riemann - stieltjes integral .",
    "we will briefly explain it below .",
    "if @xmath5 is of finite @xmath18-variation and @xmath8 is of finite @xmath19-variation with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then the line integral in ( [ eq.xode1 ] ) makes sense .",
    "the approximating riemann sum that defines the young integral is exactly the same as the one for the riemann - stieltjes integral .",
    "it is obvious from this that the young integral extends the riemann - stieltjes integral if it exists .",
    "we often use the young integration theory with @xmath22 .",
    "in such a case , the young integral is well - defined if @xmath23 and with respect to @xmath18-variation norm ( @xmath24 ) , line integrals and it maps become continuous , too .",
    "however , for some reason that will be explained shortly , it can not be used for stochastic integrals along brownian motion .",
    "our main interest in this article is that `` how far can we extend line integrals beyond young s theory in a deterministic way so that it can be used for probabilistic studies . '' of course",
    ", the main example we have in mind is a sample path of brownian motion .",
    "denote by @xmath25 the @xmath26-dimensional wiener measure , that is , the law of @xmath26-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "it sits on the space of continuous functions @xmath27 \\to { \\bf r}^d ~|~ \\mbox{conti , $ x_0=0$}\\}$ ] and is the most important probability measure in probability theory .",
    "the path @xmath28 can be viewed as a random motion under @xmath25 . in that case",
    "we call @xmath29 ( the canonical realization of ) brownian motion .",
    "it is well - known that brownian motion is a very zig - zag movement and its trajectory is very wild .",
    "for example , for any @xmath30 , the set of paths with finite @xmath18-variation is a @xmath25-zero set.$ ] equals @xmath31 , the definition of `` quadratic variation '' is different from the one of the @xmath32-variation norm in this article .",
    "so , there is no contradiction . ]",
    "therefore , it is impossible to define line integral along brownian paths by using the young ( or the riemann - stieltjes ) integral .    in standard probability theory ,",
    "a line integral along brownian paths is defined as it s stochastic integral as follows ( for simplicity we set @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a partition of @xmath36 $ ] . in defining and proving basic properties of this stochastic integral",
    ", the martingale property of brownian motion plays a crucial role . using it",
    "one can show that @xmath37   = { \\mathbf e } [   \\int_0^t   |z_s|^2 ds ] , \\ ] ] which means that stochastic integration is an isometry between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this is the most important fact in it s theory of stochastic integration .",
    "each element of @xmath39 is just an equivalence class with respect to @xmath25 and a single - point set is of @xmath25-zero set , the stochastic integral does not have an @xmath5-wise meaning .",
    "neither is it continuous in @xmath5 .",
    "for example , let us consider lvy s stochastic area for two - dimensional brownian motion @xmath40 with respect to any banach which preserves the gaussian structure of the classical wiener space , the above map is discontinuous ( see sugita @xcite ) . as a result , the solution @xmath8 to equation ( [ eq.xode1 ] ) understood in the it sense",
    "is not continuous in @xmath5 . in other words ,",
    "the it map is not or can not be made continuous in the driving path .",
    "as we have seen , deterministic line integrals such as the young integral have a limit and are unsatisfactory from a probabilistic view point .",
    "on the other hand , the it integral turned out to be extremely successful .",
    "in such a situation , discontinuity of the it map and impossibility of a pathwise definition of stochastic integrals were probably `` unpleasant facts one has to accept '' for most of the probabilists .",
    "this was the atmosphere in the probability community .",
    "t. lyons @xcite made a breakthrough by inventing rough path theory .",
    "it enables us to do pathwise study of sdes .",
    "in fact , in this theory we consider not just a path itself , but also iterated integrals of the paths together . a generalized path in this sense",
    "is called a rough path .",
    "this idea probably comes from k. t. chen s theory of iterated integrals of paths in topology . unlike in topology , however , we have to deal with paths with low regularity , since our main interest is in probabilistic applications .",
    "therefore , we have to take completion of the set of nice paths with respect to a certain banach norm , but it is difficult to find a suitable norm .",
    "the most important feature of the theory is as follows : `` if the rough path space is equipped with a suitable topology , then line integrals and it maps can be defined in a deterministic way and they become continuous . ''",
    "the continuity of it maps is called lyons continuity theorem ( or the universal limit theorem ) and is the pivot of the theory .    as is mentioned above",
    ", a rough path is a pair of its first and second level paths .",
    "the first level path is just a difference of a usual path ( which is a single line integral of the path ) and the second level path is a double integral of the usual path .",
    "if we agree that the starting point of a usual path is always the origin , then the path itself and its difference is equivalent .",
    "so , a first level path is actually a path in the usual sense .",
    "novelty is in taking iterated integrals of a path into consideration .",
    "choose @xmath41 and introduce a topology on the rough path space so that the first level paths are of finite @xmath18-variation and the second level paths are of finite @xmath42-variation .",
    "then , it is important that the following two seemingly opposite requests are satisfied simultaneously . * ( a ) *  line integrals along a rough path can be defined deterministically .",
    "this means that regularity of rough paths is nice and hence the rough path space is small at least to this extent . *",
    "( b ) *  ( lift of ) wiener measure sits on the rough path space .",
    "this means that the rough path space is large at least to this extent .",
    "if we substitute the lift of brownian motion in the lyons - it map , which is a rough path version of the it map , then we obtain the solution to the corresponding sde of stratonovich type .",
    "( an sde of stratonovich type is a slight modification of an sde of it type . )",
    "recall that the driven ode in rough path sense is deterministic and irrelevant to any measure .",
    "therefore , sdes are `` de - randomized . '' in other words , probability measures and driven odes are separated .",
    "this is impossible as long as we use the martingale integration theory .",
    "before we end this section , we make clear what are basically not used in rough path theory . *",
    "( a ) *  martingale integration theory , * ( b ) *  markov property , * ( c ) *  filtration , which is an increasing family of sub-@xmath15 field indexed by the time parameter .",
    "consequently , this theory has a strong taste of real analysis and does not look like probability theory very much .",
    "in this section we define rough paths , following @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case @xmath43 , where @xmath18 is a constant called roughness and stands for the index of variation norm .",
    "this is enough for applications to brownian motion . in this case only the first and the second level paths appear .",
    "some people prefer @xmath44-hlder norm , which is a twin sister of @xmath18-variation norm , but we basically use the variation norm in this article .",
    "of course , rough path theory extends to the case @xmath45 . in that case paths up to @xmath46$]th level , which roughly correspond to @xmath47th iterated integral ( @xmath48 $ ] ) of the first level path , are used .",
    "set @xmath49 . for @xmath50 and a continuous map @xmath51",
    ", we define @xmath18-variation norm of @xmath52 by @xmath53 here , the supremum runs over all the finite partitions @xmath54 of @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "note that , if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 implies @xmath57 .",
    "in other words , the larger @xmath18 is , the weaker the condition of finite @xmath18-variation becomes . in particular , if something is of finite @xmath58-variation , it is considered to be `` very nice '' in this theory .",
    "if you prefer the hlder norm , then instead of ( [ def.norm ] ) use @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the truncated tensor algebra of degree @xmath32 .",
    "now we define an @xmath61-valued rough path of roughness @xmath18 .",
    "the totality of such rough paths will be denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "a continuous map @xmath63 is said to be a rough path if the following two conditions are satisfied : + * ( i ) *  ( chen s identity )   for any @xmath64 , @xmath65 * ( ii ) *  ( finite @xmath18-variation ) @xmath66 .",
    "we will basically omit the obvious @xmath67th component `` @xmath58 '' and simply write @xmath68 .",
    "the two norms in condition * ( ii ) * naturally defines a distance on @xmath69 and makes it a complete metric space ( but not separable ) .",
    "the first level path @xmath70 is just a difference of the usual path in @xmath61 with finite @xmath18-variation . at first sight ,",
    "chen s identity for the second level path @xmath71 may look strange .",
    "as we will see , however , @xmath71 is an abstraction of the two - fold iterated integral of a nice usual path in @xmath61 .",
    "if the multiplication of @xmath72 is denoted by @xmath73 , then chen s identity reads @xmath74 .",
    "( this is the relation for differences of a group - valued path . )",
    "now we give a natural example of rough path .",
    "it is very important both theoretically and practically . for a continuous path @xmath75 \\to { \\bf r}^d$ ] of finite @xmath58-variation that starts from @xmath67 and @xmath76 , set @xmath77 then",
    ", it is straight forward to check that @xmath78 .",
    "it is called a smooth rough path above @xmath5 ( or the natural lift of @xmath5 ) .",
    "note that the riemann - stieltjes ( or young ) integral is used to define @xmath71 .",
    "hence , a generic continuous path can not be lifted in this way .",
    "since @xmath62 is a bit too large , we introduce the geometric rough path space .",
    "this is the main path space in rough path theory and plays a role of the classical wiener space in usual probability theory .    a rough path that can be approximated by smooth rough paths",
    "is called a geometric rough path .",
    "the set of geometric rough paths is denoted by @xmath79 , namely , @xmath80 .    by way of construction @xmath79",
    "becomes a complete separable metric space .",
    "there exist @xmath81 such that @xmath82 , but @xmath83 .",
    "this means that the second level paths do have new information . for @xmath84 , the symmetric part of @xmath85",
    "is determined by the first level path since it is given by @xmath86 .",
    "hence , all information of @xmath87 is contained in @xmath70 and the anti - symmetric part of @xmath71 .",
    "the latter is also called lvy area and has a similar form to ( [ levy ] ) . therefore",
    ", things like lvy area are built in the structure of @xmath79 and continuity of lvy area as functions on @xmath79 is almost obvious .",
    "for @xmath88 the addition `` @xmath89 '' can not be defined in general .",
    "however , a natural scalar action called the dilation exists . similarly , for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , a paired rough path @xmath92 can not be defined in general , either . however ,",
    "if one of @xmath87 and @xmath93 is a smooth rough path , then both @xmath89 and @xmath94 can be defined naturally since the `` cross integrals '' of @xmath87 and @xmath93 is well - defined as riemann - stieltjes integrals .",
    "( this paragraph is actually important ) .    in the definition of geometric rough paths , paths of finite @xmath58-variation and",
    "the riemann - stieltjes integral are used . however , even if they are replaced by paths of finite @xmath19-variation with @xmath95 and the young integral , respectively , the definition remains equivalent .",
    "similarly , the addition @xmath89 and the pair @xmath94 are in fact well - defined if one of @xmath87 and @xmath93 are of finite @xmath19-variation with @xmath95 and @xmath21 .",

    "it is known that the @xmath179-condition on the coefficient matrix in theorem [ thm_cont ] can be relaxed to one called the @xmath180-condition with @xmath181 ( see lyons , caruana and lvy @xcite for details ) .",
    "theorem [ thm_cont ] also holds for @xmath45 . in that case , a suitable sufficient condition on the coefficient is either @xmath182 + 1}_b$ ] or @xmath180 with @xmath181 .    in fact , the lyons - it map is locally lipschitz continuous not just in @xmath87 , but also in @xmath15 and the initial condition .",
    "so , it is quite flexible .",
    "if particular , if it is regarded as a map in the initial condition ( and the time ) only , it naturally defines a rough path version of a flow of diffeomorphism associated to an ode / sde .",
    "there are other methods to solve rdes .",
    "davie @xcite solved an rde by constructing a rough path version of the euler(-maruyama ) approximation method ( see friz and victior @xcite for details ) .",
    "this method seems powerful .",
    "moreover , bailleul invented his flow method , which is something like a `` monster version '' of davie s method .",
    "in this method , not just one initial value , but all initial values are considered simultaneously and approximate solutions takes values in the space of homeomorphisms . using this , he recently solved rdes with linearly growing coefficient .",
    "( precisely , the condition is that @xmath15 itself may have linear growth , but its derivatives are all bounded .",
    "see @xcite for detail . )",
    "gubinelli s approach is also important , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "however , it is not that his method to solve pdes is different , but his formalism is .",
    "the aim of this section is to present gubinelli s formalism of rough path theory in a nutshell .",
    "it is recently called the controlled path theory and currently competes with lyons original formalism .",
    "it seems unlikely that one of the two defeats the other in the near future .",
    "however , it is also true that this formalism is gaining attentions , because it is simpler in a sense and recently produced offsprings , namely , two new theories of singular stochastic pdes ( hairer s regularity structure theory and gubinelli - imkeller - perkovski s paracontrolled distribution theory ) .",
    "the core of gubinelli s idea is in his definition of rough path integrals . in lyons original definition ,",
    "it is basically of the form @xmath105 . in other words ,",
    "`` @xmath87 in @xmath183 '' and `` @xmath87 in @xmath184 '' must be the same and an integral @xmath185 can not be defined in general .",
    "this is reasonable since a line integral is defined for a @xmath58-form .",
    "however , impossibility of varying @xmath87 and @xmath93 independently looks quite strange to most of probabilist who are not familiar with rough paths .",
    "the author himself got surprised when he started studying the theory . since things like that are possible in the young ( or riemann - stieltjes ) integration and it s stochastic integration , some people may have tried it for rough path integral only to find it hopeless .",
    "almost everyone gives up at this point and forget this issue .",
    "gubinelli did not , however .",
    "he advanced `` halfway '' by setting a banach space of integrands for each rough path @xmath87 in an abstract way .",
    "since this space contains elements of the form @xmath183 , this is an extension of lyons rough path integration .",
    "this banach space depends on @xmath87 and may be different for different @xmath87 . hence , this is not a complete separation of @xmath87 and the integrand .",
    "such an integrand is called a controlled path ( with respect to @xmath87 ) and @xmath87 is sometimes called a reference rough path .",
    "one rough analogy for heuristic understanding is that it looks like a `` vector bundle '' whose base space is an infinite dimensional curved space and whose fiber space is a banach space .",
    "the fiber spaces above different @xmath87 s are different vector spaces , although they look similar .    in this formalism",
    ", the integration map sends an integrand with respect to @xmath87 to an integral with respect to @xmath87 ( which takes values in another euclidean space ) for each fixed @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , a solution to an rde driven by @xmath87 is understood as a fixed point in a certain banach space of integrands with respect to @xmath87 .",
    "now we give a brief mathematical explanation .",
    "see friz and hairer @xcite for details . in this section",
    "we use @xmath44-hlder topology instead of @xmath18-variation topology .",
    "we assume @xmath43 for simplicity again , though the controlled path theory extends to the case @xmath45 . the geometric rough path space with @xmath44-hlder topology is denoted by @xmath186 .",
    "the @xmath47th level path of @xmath187 is estimated by @xmath188-hlder norm ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "let @xmath187 .",
    "a pair @xmath190 is said to be an @xmath136-valued controlled path ( controlled by @xmath87 ) if the following three conditions are satisfied :    * ( i ) *  @xmath191 , where @xmath192 stands for the space of @xmath136-valued , @xmath44-hlder continuous paths .",
    "+ * ( ii ) *  @xmath193 . + * ( iii ) *   if @xmath194 is defined by @xmath195 then @xmath196 holds .    note",

    "note also that @xmath93 and @xmath199 are one - parameter @xmath44-hlder continuous functions , while @xmath200 is a two - parameter @xmath201-hlder continuous function .",
    "loosely , the last condition means that `` behavior of @xmath93 is at worst as bad as that of @xmath87 '' since regularity of @xmath200 is better .",
    "( to check this , fix @xmath202 arbitrarily and let @xmath198 vary near @xmath202 . )",
    "the totality of such @xmath190 is denoted by @xmath203 , which becomes a banach space equipped with the norm @xmath204 .",
    "one should note that this banach space of controlled paths depends on @xmath87 .",
    "examples of controlled paths include : * ( a ) *  @xmath87 itself . precisely @xmath205 . *",

    "rough path integration is generalized .",
    "there is a significant difference , however . in lyons formalism , the rough path integration maps a geometric rough path space to another . in gubinelli",
    "s formalism , it mops a controlled path space to another for each fixed reference geometric rough path @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , it is linear in @xmath190 .",

    "then , composition @xmath219 and the rough path integral belongs to @xmath220 again .",
    "therefore , the integration map on the right hand side maps @xmath203 to itself and it makes sense to think of its fixed points , which are solutions to the rde . as we have seen , a solution to an rde in this formalism is not a rough path , but a controlled path with respect to the driving rough path @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath15 is of @xmath179 , then the rde has a unique global solution and the corresponding lyons - it map is locally lipschitz continuous . from this",
    "we can see that the ( first level paths of ) the solutions in both lyons and gubinelli s senses agree for any @xmath87 .",

    "the support theorem answers this question .",
    "it claims that we should look at where the corresponding deterministic it map sends cameron - martin paths . for @xmath303 ,",

    "@xmath296 is dense in it . hence , if it map _ were _ continuous , the support theorem would be very easy .",

    "the case of the usual sde was first proved by azencott @xcite and ben arous @xcite , followed by many others .    in this article",
    ", we consider this problem from a viewpoint of rough path theory .",
    "an advantage of this approach is as follows .",
    "the most important part of the proof is taylor expansion of ( lyons-)it map .",
    "it also becomes deterministic in rough path theory and therefore small difference of the original gaussian process does not matter as long as it admits a rough path lift .",
    "consequently , the rough path proof can treat the cases of the usual brownian motion and fbm in a unified way .",
    "now we introduce assumptions :    * ( h1 ) : * for some @xmath276 , @xmath373 and @xmath374 are real - valued bounded continuous functions defined on @xmath375 .    * ( h2 ) : * a real - valued function @xmath376 on @xmath296 defined by @xmath377 achieves a minimum exactly at one point @xmath378 .    * ( h3 ) : * on a certain neighborhood of @xmath379 in @xmath375 , @xmath373 and @xmath374 are frchet smooth and all of their derivatives are bounded .    *",
    "( h4 ) : * the hessian @xmath380 of @xmath381 at @xmath378 is strictly larger than @xmath382 in the form sense .",
    "these assumptions are typical for laplace approximations .",
    "we assume in addition that the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath351 are bounded , smooth with bounded derivatives of all order .",
    "then , we can show the following asymptotic expansion : as @xmath321 we have @xmath383 = \\exp ( - \\hat{f } ( \\gamma )   /{\\varepsilon}^2 )   \\bigl ( \\alpha_0   + \\alpha_1 { \\varepsilon}+ \\cdots +    \\alpha_m { \\varepsilon}^m   + \\cdots \\bigr)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for certain constants @xmath384 .",

    ", we can see from the ldp that contributions from the complement set of the neighborhood is negligible .",
    "a more detailed explanation is as follows .",
    "denote by @xmath386 the lyons - it map associated with the coefficient @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "substitute the young pairing @xmath387 of @xmath388 and @xmath251 into @xmath334 .",
    "then , @xmath389 and @xmath390 , where @xmath391 and its natural lift is denoted by the same symbol .",
    "what we need in the proof is an expansion of @xmath392 .",
    "note that @xmath393 is in fact a young translation by @xmath385 .",
    "there exist @xmath394 such that the first level path admits the following expansion as @xmath321 with respect to the @xmath18-variation topology : @xmath395 formally , each @xmath396 satisfies a simple ode of first order and can be written down by the variation of constants formula . since @xmath396 is of order @xmath397 as a functional of @xmath87 ,",
    "the above expansion is something like taylor expansion .",
    "of course , the remainder term also satisfies a reasonable estimate with respect to the rough path topology .",
    "( one should note here that , while @xmath87 can be an arbitrary element in @xmath237 , @xmath385 has to be a `` nice '' path so that the young translation works .",
    "otherwise , this expansion would not make sense . )",
    "let us take a look from a slightly different angle .",
    "this explanation might be easier for non - experts of rough path theory . in the setting of finite variation",
    ", the it map in the riemann - stieltjes sense is known to be frchet smooth .",
    "hence , it admits a taylor expansion around any @xmath385 for an infinitesimal vector @xmath398 .",
    "the taylor terms are formally the same as @xmath399 s above .",
    "the taylor - like expansion for @xmath348 is a completion with respect to the rough path topology of this taylor expansion in frchet sense .",

    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "as before we consider the sde with the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath351 , but we denote the column vectors of @xmath15 by @xmath401 and @xmath351 by @xmath402",

    "take ( formal ) differentiation of @xmath406 with respect to the initial value @xmath407 .",
    "then , @xmath408 and @xmath409 are @xmath410-matrices and satisfy the following odes at least formally : @xmath411 here , @xmath412 is regarded as a @xmath410-matrix , too .",
    "this @xmath397 is called a jacobian process of the original differential equation and plays a very important role in analysis of the usual sdes",
    ". therefore , it should be very important in rough path theory , too .",
    "when we regard ( [ wai])-([kay ] ) as a system of rdes driven by a geometric rough path @xmath87 , we have troubles .",
    "the first one is that the coefficients of ( [ jay])-([kay ] ) are not bounded .",
    "hence , we can not use the standard version of lyons continuity theorem ( theorem [ thm_cont ] ) .",
    "rdes with unbounded coefficients are often difficult to handle and their solutions may explode in finite time",
    ".    however , the system of rdes ( [ wai])-([kay ] ) has a unique time - global solution and lyons continuity theorem holds .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "because of a `` triangular '' structure of the system , rde ( [ wai ] ) solves first and we obtain @xmath109 .",
    "now that @xmath413 is known , ( [ jay ] ) and ( [ kay ] ) become linear rdes .",
    "a solution to a linear driven ode can be expressed as an infinite sum . by generalizing this argument to the case of rough path topology",
    ", we obtain the first level path of a solution to a linear rde .",
    "if the first level path of the solution stays inside a sufficiently large ball , then behavior of the coefficients outside the ball is irrelevant and we can use a standard cut - off technique to obtain higher level paths of the solution and prove the continuity theorem .",
    "thus , we have seen that for every @xmath90 , the system ( [ wai])-([kay ] ) has a unique time - global solution @xmath414 .    in stochastic analysis for rdes , integrability of @xmath415 and @xmath416 matters .",
    "due to the cut - off argument as above , it is sufficient to prove integrability of @xmath417 .",
    "however , this was quite hard since a straight forward computation yields @xmath418 }   \\|x^i\\|_{p / i}^{p / i } \\bigr)\\ ] ] for some constant @xmath419 .",
    "if @xmath87 is a gaussian rough path , then we usually have @xmath420 .",
    "fernique s theorem is not available and the right hand side is not even in @xmath421 .",
    "an integrability lemma by cass , litterer and lyons @xcite solves this problem . for any @xmath422 , set @xmath423 and @xmath424 }",

    "@xmath425}$ ] is the @xmath97-variation norm of @xmath426 restricted on the subinterval @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "then , we set @xmath427 this quantity is important .",
    "since it is non - increasing in @xmath428 , integrability of @xmath429 is valuable for small @xmath428 .",
    "if we compute on each subinterval @xmath430 $ ] , we can prove @xmath431 where @xmath432 is a constant which may depend on @xmath428 .",
    "note that this is a deterministic estimate .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to show the exponential integrability of @xmath429 for some @xmath428 .",
    "they proved in @xcite that for a gaussian rough path @xmath225 with the complementary young regularity condition , there exists @xmath433 such that @xmath434 < \\infty$ ] for any @xmath422 .",
    "( more precisely , they gave a sharp estimate of the tail probability of @xmath435 ) .",
    "consequently , both sides of ( [ estjk ] ) have moments of all order .",
    "thus , we have obtained moment estimates of the jacobian process for an rde driven by a gaussian rough path .",
    "as most of successful theories in analysis , malliavin calculus has its abstract part and concrete examples of functionals to which the abstract theory apply .",
    "the former is the theory of sobolev spaces on an abstract wiener spaces . in other words , it is differential and integral calculus on an infinite dimensional gaussian space .",
    "the latter is solutions to sdes .",
    "hence , a natural question is whether malliavin calculus is applicable to rdes driven by a gaussian rough path . in this section ,",
    "we consider rde ( [ wai ] ) with @xmath436-coefficient vector fields driven by a gaussian rough path as in section [ sec.gauss ] .",
    "the first works in this direction are cass and friz ( and victoir ) @xcite .",
    "they consider the lift of gaussian processes with the complementary young condition and a certain non - degeneracy condition .",
    "( loosely , this `` non - degeneracy '' condition above is to exclude gaussian processes that do not diffuse very much such as the pinned brownian motion . )",
    "examples include fractional brownian motion with @xmath437 $ ] .",
    "they proved that the solution @xmath438 to the rde is differentiable in a weak sense , namely , it belongs to the local sobolev space @xmath439 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath403 satisfies hrmander s bracket generating condition at the starting point @xmath440 , malliavin covariance matrix of @xmath438 is non - degenerate in a weak sense , namely , it is invertible a.s . , which implies that the law of @xmath438 has a density @xmath441 with respect to the lesbegue measure @xmath442 .",
    "however , this argument bring us no information on regularity of the density .    as in the study of the usual sdes",
    ", we would like to show that ( i ) the solution @xmath438 belongs to the sobolev space @xmath443 for any integrability index @xmath444 and the differentiability index @xmath445 and ( ii ) malliavin covariance matrix of @xmath438 is non - degenerate in the sense of malliavin , namely , the determinant of the inverse of the covariance matrix has moments of all order . these imply smoothness of the density in @xmath446 .",
    "the biggest obstacle was the moment estimates of the jacobian process as in the previous section , however .",
    "for example , @xmath447 , the @xmath260th derivative of the solution , has an explicit expression which involves the jacobian processes and its inverse . therefore , unless this obstacle was removed , we could not proceed .",
    "after the moment estimates was recently proved , malliavin calculus for rdes has developed rapidly .",
    "first , hairer and pillai @xcite proved the case of fbm with @xmath448 $ ] .",
    "differentiability in the sense of malliavin calculus , that is , @xmath449 for any @xmath450 and @xmath451 , was shown by fractional calculus . the point in their proof of non - degeneracy of the malliavin covariance matrix is a deterministic version of norris lemma in the framework of the controlled path theory .    under the young complementary regularity condition ,",
    "differentiability was shown in inahama @xcite .",
    "the theory of wiener chaos , not fractional calculus , is used in the proof .",
    "non - degeneracy under hrmander s condition was proved by cass , hairer , litterer and tindel @xcite ( and baudoin , ouyang and zhang @xcite ) for a rather general class of gaussian processes including fbm with @xmath437 $ ] .",
    "since these recent results enables us to study rdes with malliavin calculus quite smoothly , this research topic may make great advances in the near future .",
    "some papers on this topic in the case of fbm were already published .",
    "( 1 )  varadhan s estimate , that is , short time asymptotics of the logarithm of the density @xmath452 ( see @xcite ) . ( 2 )  smoothing property of the `` heat semigroup '' under kusuoka s ufg condition ( see baudoin , ouyang and zhang @xcite ) .",
    "this condition is on the lie brackets of the coefficient vector fields and weaker than hrmander s condition .",

    ", watanabe s theory of generalized wiener functionals , ( that is , watanabe distributions ) and asymptotic theory for them are used .",
    "the theory is known to be a very powerful tool in malliavin calculus , but it also works well in the frameworks of rough path theory .",
    "we also point out that the proof of the off - diagonal asymptotics is a kind of laplace approximation in the framework of malliavin calculus and therefore the taylor - like expansion in section 11 plays a crucial role .",
    "for lack of space , we did not discuss some important topics in and around rough path theory .",
    "the most important among them is applying ideas from rough path theory to stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) .",
    "this is an attempt to use rough path theory to solve singular spdes which can not be solved by existing methods .",
    "( one should not misunderstand that the general theory of spde is rewritten or extended with rough paths . )",
    "several attempts have already been published , but there seems to be no unified theory .",
    "so , reviewing them in details in a short article like this is impossible , but we give a quick comment on two of them which look very active now .",
    "the two most successful ones are hairer s regularity structure theory @xcite and gubinelli - imkeller - perkowski s para - controlled distribution thoery @xcite . examples of singular spdes these theories solve are similar , including kpz equation , the dynamic @xmath454 , three dimensional stochastic navier - stokes equation , etc . , but the two theories look quite different .",
    "they now should be classified as independent theories , not as a part of rough path theory .",
    "the numerical and the statistical studies of the usual sdes are very important .",
    "hence , it might be interesting to consider analogous problems for rdes driven by a gaussian rough path .",
    "not so many papers have been written by now , but we believe these topics will be much larger .",
    "approximations of sdes from a viewpoint of rough paths should be included in this paragraph , too .    neither have we mentioned signatures of rough path t. lyons and coauthors study intensively . for a ( rough ) path defined on the time interval @xmath36 $ ]",
