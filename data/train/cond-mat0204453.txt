    "as mentioned above , these years great efforts have been contributed to ising model with competing dynamics . because exact analytical treatment is too hard ,",
    "most of the studies have been either approximation or monte carlo simulation .",
    "there are some differences between the conventional method and ours . in the following paragraph we present our considerations .    the results one may expect directly depend on the expression of the transition ( flipping , exchange , redistribution ) probabilities .",
    "we think that there are two requirements : first , this probability should contain the hamiltonian , and thus naturally favors either higher energy ( kawasaki - type ) or lower energy ( glauber - type ) .",
    "second , introducing temperature into it , we require that the transition be influenced by the heat noise .",
    "it is the first requirement that makes the two mechanisms compete and in all the studies it has been well adopted .",
    "however , due to the difficulties of actual practice , most of them used the simplified versions . in most of the studies , the temperature factor has not been introduced into the exchange probability , while in the flipping probability it has been only partly combined . typically for ferromagnetic ising model",
    "it has been set as : glauber - type @xmath31 kawasaki - type @xmath32    in the new mechanism the transition and redistribution probabilities do not take the simplified versions .",
    "besides some mathematical aspects such as normalization , their difference lies in the role of temperature . with the new mechanism",
    "there is greater influence of heat on the system .",
    "the fact , order for lower temperature and disorder for higher temperature , is not universally true in the phase diagrams obtained in earlier studies@xcite .",
    "however , we believe that this expectation will be unshakable if the system is governed by the new mechanism . in order to further study it , we applied our method to @xmath2 ising model .",
    "it is well known that , due to the heat noise , there is only paramagnetic phase in @xmath2 ising model .",
    "the analytical results we obtained confirms this conclusion , however one increases the energy flux , for all temperatures .",
    "( the details are in appendix a , but we suggest you read it later for your easier understanding of our method . ) @xmath2 ising model governed by the conventional mechanism has been studied in ref.@xcite with approximation method and mc simulation .",
    "further application on @xmath3 ising model is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "there is no better or worse , since the two mechanisms have different characteristics , but we think the comparison will be interesting and also feasible in practice .",
    "in this section we apply the new mechanism to the @xmath33 kinetic gaussian model and report our findings with the phase diagram .",
    "one and two - dimensional cases are quite similar .",
    "first we briefly review some basic properties of this model .",
    "gaussian model , proposed by t. h. berlin and m. kac , at first in order to make ising model more tractable , is an continuous - spin model .",
    "it has the same hamiltonian as the ising model ( three dimensional ) , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath21 means summation over nearest neighbors . compared with the ising model , it has two extensions : first , the spins @xmath36 can take any real value between @xmath37 .",
    "second , to prevent the spins from tending to infinity , the probability of finding a given spin between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is assumed to be the gaussian - type distribution @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a distribution constant independent of temperature .",
    "being an extension of ising model , gaussian model is quite different however . in the equilibrium case ,",
    "on translational invariant lattices it is exactly solvable , and later as a starting point to study the unsolvable models it has also been investigated with mean field theory and the momentum - space renormalization - group method .    as an example of the applications of single - spin transition and spin - pair redistribution mechanism , we have studied kinetic gaussian model with both of them respectively .",
    "we summarize its dynamic properties as follows@xcite .",
    "the inherent dynamical competition of this model is that : the system tries to lower its hamiltonian with the spins tending to infinity , while the gaussian - type probability serves to restrict this tendency . above the critical temperature ,",
    "the prevailing heat noise permits only a disordered state , whereas below the critical point some kind of order will appear .",
    "our study shows that , on translational - invariant lattices , _ the dynamic critical exponent _ @xmath4 _  is independent of space dimensionality and the governing dynamical mechanism .",
    "_    now we turn to treat the @xmath33 kinetic gaussian model with the competing dynamics . @xmath2 and @xmath3 systems can be treated in a similar way and they have qualitatively the same properties . in earlier studies we obtained the time expectation of single - spin . with the competing mechanism we can borrow these equations from ref.@xcite and @xcite .",

    "each term in a bracket is a second order derivative of @xmath48 , and they will cancel each other if a summation is taken over all the spins .",
    "thus @xmath49 .",
    "then with the competing mechanisms , @xmath50    it is natural to first consider using the system hamiltonian , @xmath51 to characterize its behavior .",
    "if we find the hamiltonian is decreasing , then the system is believed to be evolving to ferromagnetic phase ; if the hamiltonian is stable around zero , the system must be in paramagnetic phase ; if the hamiltonian is increasing , then the system is evolving towards antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "unfortunately , in gaussian model although we can conveniently obtain the exact result for @xmath52 and the average value , @xmath53 , we find it difficult to obtain an analytical result of the system hamiltonian . in order to differentiate between these phases ,",
    "instead we study the following two aspects .",
    "first , magnetization , @xmath54 and second , @xmath55 for pure ferromagnetic phase , if without any extra conditions , we expect nonzero magnetization , that is to say , @xmath56 . at the same time , if the system is divided into two penetrating subsets , in one of which the spins have @xmath57 being an odd number , and in the other one the spins have @xmath57 being even , then one will find these two subsets are almost identical , and that leads to @xmath58 .",
    "so @xmath59 and @xmath58 is the characteristic of ferromagnetic phase . for pure antiferromagnetic phase ,",
    "we expect such a situation that the system can be divided into two penetrating opposing sublattices in the way mentioned above , one of positive spin and one of negative . except the direction of the spins , these two sublattices are identical .",
    "this leads to @xmath60 but @xmath61 . in disordered paramagnetic phase",
    ", we expect disorder of the whole system and both @xmath62 and @xmath63 to be zero . thus , if we get the evolution of @xmath62 and @xmath64 , we can decide in which phase the system is .",
    "with eqs.([1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) we can write the time derivative of @xmath62 and @xmath64 as , @xmath65 and @xmath66 m^{\\prime } \\left ( t\\right )   \\label{m'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the details of eqs.([m ] ) are in appendix b. because we want @xmath67 to be positive , the inequality @xmath68 becomes @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "fig.1 shows the phase diagram of @xmath33 kinetic gaussian model .",
    "it is divided into several regions by the following three curves , @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "\\label{curve3}\\ ] ] phase diagrams for @xmath2 and @xmath3 models are quite similar .    we know that the critical point of @xmath33 gaussian model is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the space dimensionality . in the region above line ( [ curve1 ] ) , the temperature is higher than the critical value .",
    "both @xmath62 and @xmath76 are approaching zero exponentially , and this is identified as paramagnetic phase .",
    "the overwhelming heat noise permits no observable magnetization , and the hamiltonian is static in equilibrium .",
    "when the temperature is below @xmath77 , the heat noise becomes secondary and some kind of order appears .    for the region below line ( [ curve1 ] ) and above curve ( [ curve3 ] ) , as well as that below line ( [ curve2 ] ) , we have exponentially increasing @xmath78 while @xmath64 is approaching zero , and this corresponds to ferromagnetic phase . in this phase ,",
    "glauber - type mechanism prevails and the energy is decreasing .",
    "there is observable homogeneous magnetization , the direction of which depends on that of the initial magnetization .    in the region between curve ( [ curve2 ] ) and line ( [ curve3 ] ) we have both exponentially increasing @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and it can not be simply identified as ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic . we give it a name , heterophase . in this region , the kawasaki mechanism and the energy flux control the system , and the energy has a tendency to increase .",
    "the spin values are interesting .",
    "our analytical results show that @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this means that , if the initial phase is ferromagnetic , @xmath81 , but @xmath82 , later we will observe @xmath83 increasing but @xmath64 staying at zero .",
    "if initially the system is antiferromagnetic , @xmath84 , but @xmath85 , later we will have @xmath86 increasing but @xmath62 staying at zero .",
    "if initially a disordered paramagnetic phase is given , @xmath87 , and also @xmath81 , we will get both zero @xmath62 and @xmath64 . from this one",
    "may get confused ,",
    "what is the real picture ? how is the energy sure to increase if the spin values are dependent on other conditions ?",
    "direct computer simulation reveals the key .",
    "for example , we apply the periodic boundary condition and initially set the system as , @xmath88 this leads to @xmath89 , but @xmath81 . after @xmath90 second ,",
    "it becomes ( we only give approximate values ) , @xmath91 after @xmath92 seconds , @xmath93 after @xmath94 seconds , @xmath95 this shows the routine of _ self - organization _ the system chooses in this specific case , and it is a self - explanatory picture of how the energy manages to increase while @xmath58 .",
    "however , there is one exception .",
    "if at the beginning the system is set in a pure homogeneous ferromagnetic phase , we will find that the system remains in this homogeneous state .",
    "how can one explain this ?",
    "actually the system does have a tendency to increase its energy in this region , but it needs a hint to know exactly how .",
    "here we cite the words of tome and oliveira@xcite : it is  the result , in the case considered here , of a far from equilibrium process , namely , the continuous flux of energy into the system .",
    "thus an instability of the usual ( equilibrium ) solutions leads the system toward states with spatial self - organized structure .",
    " the self - organization routine is closely related with a basic phenomenon of symmetry loss .",
    "a system under conditions that lead to paramagnetic phase is like a ball placed on the ground , for which all directions are identical .",
    "a system set in such a heterophase is like a ball placed on the top of another sphere .",
    "the upper ball has a tendency to fall down , but the direction depends on some kind of disturbance . if there is no disturbance at all , it will stay still .",
    "it will even have its energy increasing if the lower ball is being lifted up .",
    "surely in reality we have never seen a ball stay still on the top of another , because disturbance can not be avoided .",
    "so discussion here is only to help qualitatively explain this strange phase and the mechanism hidden behind .",
    "in this article , we have given a systematic formulation of the new competing mechanism .",
    "the glauber - type single - spin transition mechanism with probability @xmath0 simulates the contact of the system with the heat bath and the kawasaki - type spin - pair redistribution mechanism with probability @xmath1 simulates an external energy flux .",
    "these two mechanisms themselves are natural generalizations of glauber s single - spin flipping mechanism and kawasaki s spin - pair exchange mechanism .",
    "thus , on the one hand , this mechanism is in principle applicable to arbitrary systems , while on the other hand , our formulation is able to contain a mechanism that just _ directly _ combines single - spin flipping and spin - pair exchange _ in their original forms _ ( not simplified ) . _  _ compared with the conventional one , the new mechanism does not assume the simplified versions .",
    "their difference lies in the different role the system temperature plays .",
    "( as we have emphasized before , there is no better or worse , since they are different . )",
    "we applied the new mechanism to @xmath2 ising model and used the analytical results to exemplify this difference . with the new mechanism",
    ", there is greater influence of temperature and the fact , order for lower temperature and disorder for higher temperature , will be universally true .    in sec .",
    "[ sec.4 ] , we applied this mechanism to @xmath33 kinetic gaussian model . @xmath2 and",

    ", we confirm the expectation , order for lower temperature and disorder for higher temperature . for temperature above @xmath77",
    ", the system evolves to paramagnetic phase . for temperature lower than @xmath77",
    ", we observe ferromagnetic phase and another heterophase ( instead of the antiferromagnetic phase as guessed ) .",
    "this interesting heterophase is the result of the energy flux and self - organization .",
    "we have analyzed it in details in that section , and hope it will help make clear the self - organization process in phase transitions . with regard to ising model , we also hope it will be a good reference when people are trying to solve the puzzling differences between the results yielded by approximation method and mc simulation .",

    "<S> in this article , we have given a systematic formulation of the new generalized competing mechanism : the glauber - type single - spin transition mechanism , with probability @xmath0 , simulates the contact of the system with the heat bath , and the kawasaki - type spin - pair redistribution mechanism , with probability @xmath1 , simulates an external energy flux . </S>",
    "<S> these two mechanisms are natural generalizations of glauber s single - spin flipping mechanism and kawasaki s spin - pair exchange mechanism respectively . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the new mechanism is in principle applicable to arbitrary systems , while on the other hand , our formulation is able to contain a mechanism that just directly combines single - spin flipping and spin - pair exchange in their original form . _  _ compared with the conventional mechanism , the new mechanism does not assume the simplified version and leads to greater influence of temperature . the fact , order for lower temperature and disorder for higher temperature , will be universally true . in order to exemplify this difference , we applied the mechanism to @xmath2 ising model and obtained analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> we also applied this mechanism to kinetic gaussian model and found that , above the critical point there will be only paramagnetic phase , while below the critical point , the self - organization as a result of the energy flux will lead the system to an interesting heterophase , instead of the initially guessed antiferromagnetic phase . </S>",
