    "our goal is to discern whether a moderately varying m giant , such as r doradus , could be modelled satisfactory with a hydrostatic model photosphere .",
    "we observed the @xmath2 region with the iso sws 06 at a resolution of @xmath3 and the full @xmath4 region with the sws 01 at @xmath5 .",
    "the low - resolution sws01 observation is used to ensure that the different sws06 observations in this region were properly aligned .",
    "we have calculated hydrostatic model photospheres with the marcs code in spherical geometry .",
    "synthetic spectra were calculated using these model photospheres .",
    "the synthetic spectra , also calculated in spherical geometry , include lines from h@xmath6o ( partridge & schwenke 1997 ) , co ( goorwitch 1994 ) , sio ( langhoff & bauschlicher 1993 ) , ch ( jrgensen et al . 1996 ) , cn ( jrgensen & larsson 1990 and plez 1998 , priv . com . ) ,",
    "oh ( goldman et al . 1998 ) , c@xmath6 ( querci et al . 1971 and",
    "jrgensen 2001 , priv . com . ) , and co@xmath6 ( hitemp ; rothman et al . 1992 ) .",
    "we are able to fit the observed range well with a hydrostatic model photosphere , see figs .",
    "[ fig - noll ] and [ fig-0 ] .",
    "our best fit model have the fundamental parameters of @xmath7 k , @xmath8 , and solar metallicity .",
    "we find that the wavelength region investigated is sensitive to the effective temperature used in the modeling of the photosphere .",
    "the agreement between the synthetic spectrum and the iso observations is encouraging , especially in the wavelength region of @xmath9 , suggesting that a hydrostatic model photosphere is adequate for the calculation of synthetic spectra in the near infrared for this moderately varying red giant star .",
    "however , an additional absorption component is needed at @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we also find that the model does not account for this extra absorption component at the beginning of the interval .",
    "for a discussion of this discrepancy see ryde & eriksson ( 2002 ) .",
    "the spectral signatures are dominated by water vapour in the stellar photosphere , but several photospheric oh , co , and sio features are also present .    figs .",
    "@xmath11 show which molecules are important contributors to the emergent spectrum ( up to @xmath1 ) of r doradus .",
    "the synthetic spectra shown there are all calculated using our r dor model atmosphere .",
    "however , the spectra are synthesized with only one molecule at a time .",
    "r dor is a moderately varying m giant .",
    "we have modelled its 3 micron iso spectrum ( resolving power is ca 2000 ) successfully with a hydrostatic model photosphere .",
    "dynamical models are , however , certainly needed for the mira stars , which show larger variations with time .",
    "line opacities contributing at @xmath12 microns are h@xmath6o , co , oh , and sio . the region is found to be very temperature sensitive , and it is found that an extra absorption is needed at 2.6 - 2.8 microns .",
