    "the idea of inducing charge transport in nanodevices by means of special type of time - dependent manipulations with the parameters of a device was formulated theoretically as adiabatic pumping @xcite and nano - electromechanical shuttling @xcite mechanisms .",
    "both phenomena are related to charge transfer through a nanoobject under perturbation @xmath0 periodic both in time @xmath1 and a coordinate @xmath2 . in case of pumping , @xmath2 is not necessarily a spatial coordinate .",
    "it may be , e.g. , the point on the coulomb diamond diagram for the tunnel conductance @xmath3 in double quantum dots , which circumscribes closed trajectories as a function of the gate voltages @xmath4 and @xmath5 applied to two dots @xcite .",
    "not only charge but also spin density may be pumped within this paradigm.@xcite electron - electron interaction plays essential part in the adiabatic pumping . in particular , the resonance kondo - like tunneling is essential for the spin - charge separation of the pumping component of tunnel current ( see , e.g. , ref . for discussion of this problem and references therein to other theoretical investigations of adiabatic",
    "pumping in quantum dots ) .    in pumping devices",
    "the nanoobject is immovable , and single - electron transport is induced by time - dependent control parameters . in the nanoelectromechanical",
    "shuttling ( nems ) the charge and spin transport occurs due to an interplay of electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom : a nanoobject ( or its parts ) move periodically in real space between the electrodes and transport electrons from one electrode to another in the course of this motion . in the `` classical '' nems@xcite the shuttling instability develops because the charge accumulation in the shuttle induced by electron tunneling results in an electromechanical instability of the shuttle at a sufficiently large bias voltage and periodic mechanical motion of the shuttle arises in the system .",
    "mechanical motion of the shuttle may be also induced in the `` dot '' geometry , where a nano - island is attached to a flexible pillar or cantilever.@xcite as a rule , shuttling in these devices is substantially nonadiabatic .",
    "usage of flexible nanowires in the shuttling circuits opens new exciting possibilities .",
    "the flexural vibration of a suspended nanowire in combination with a scanning tunnel microscope working as one of the two electrodes may be used for realization of a charge transport in the shuttling regime.@xcite on the other hand the nano - island may be attached to such a string .",
    "then mechanical motion of a shuttle will be provided by excitation of vibrational eigenmodes of this string.@xcite if the coulomb blockade in the island is strong enough , the single electron shuttling regime may be realized under certain experimental conditions.@xcite although the shuttle motion induced by the string flexure is slow in comparison with characteristic tunneling rate , the adiabaticity is usually violated when the shuttle approaches the electrodes and moves away .    in this paper",
    "we consider the single electron transport in suspended nems geometry .",
    "we study the shuttle shaped like a dumbbell ( double quantum dot ) rocking periodically around a fixed axis .",
    "such turnstile transports electrons by means of cotunneling mechanism .",
    "first , we formulate the problem of cyclic tunneling in general terms .",
    "second , we calculate the periodic time - dependent conductance in the adiabatic regime . finally , the role of non - adiabaticity will be discussed qualitatively .",
    "as is known , cotunneling mechanism is a cornerstone of the kondo regime of tunnel conductance through quantum dots under strong coulomb blockade .",
    "the cotunneling amplitude @xmath6 , which arises in the second order perturbation theory in tunneling integrals @xmath7 between the dot and the left and right metallic leads is exponentially weak , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the ionization energy of quantum dot ) . due to formation of many - particle abrikosov - suhl resonances at the fermi level",
    ", this amplitude approaches unity at low temperatures ( @xmath10),@xcite and the zero bias anomaly ( zba ) in quantum conductance shows up in the coulomb diamond window.@xcite    shuttling provides another enhancement mechanism for single electron tunneling , which exists even in the absence of kondo screening.@xcite this mechanism is an analog of the debye - waller effect in neutron scattering intensity : the average distance between the dot and the leads effectively reduces due to periodic motion of the shuttle between the source and drain electrodes .",
    "the exponential enhancement of effective tunneling transparency is controlled by the ratio @xmath11 , where the numerator is the average mean square displacement of the shuttle position relative to its static distance @xmath12 from the leads ( the device is supposed to be symmetric ) .",
    "recently we have described one more enhancement mechanism unrelated to kondo effect , which may be realized in half - metals with the energy gap for minority spin carriers.@xcite this mechanism may be evinced as a finite bias anomaly in conductance , which arises due to opening of a resonance tunneling channel for the minority spin carriers .    in this paper",
    "we consider tunneling through a dumbbell shaped shuttle .",
    "a schematic sketch of the device is presented in fig .",
    "[ f.0 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "we suppose that this shuttle is suspended on an elastic string oriented perpendicularly to the figure plane , e.g. , by means of the method developed in ref . .",
    "another option is to suspend two islands on a string where the standing wave polarized in the tunneling plane is excited ( fig .",
    "[ f.0 ] , right panel ) .",
    "let us turn to the twisting turnstile as a more simple in practical realization object .",
    "we consider the idealized case where the equilibrium position with zero strain corresponds to the symmetric orientation of the dumbbell relative to the edges .",
    "then the torque vibration mode may be excited in the string , which induces the in - plane rotation of the dumbbell .",
    "when the rotation angle approaches @xmath13 , the distances between the dots and _ both _ leads become small and the tunneling amplitude increases simultaneously for the source and the drain lead ( see fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] ) . if the coulomb blockade is strong enough , the number of electrons in the turnstile is fixed and an electron from the lead can tunnel from the source into a turnstile only provided another electron leaves the dot simultaneously .",
    "thus effective elastic cotunneling arises as a zba in the tunnel conductance with strongly enhanced amplitude .",
    "one may say that electrons tunnel between two banks in a shuttling regime , where a carrier may be injected from a bank to the moving island during the limited time span , when one of the two islands is passing this bank . in our idealized geometry",
    "this condition is satisfied by assuming that in the equilibrium position at rotation angle @xmath14 tunneling is exponentially weak and electron can jump onto the shuttle or leave it only at @xmath15 .",
    "second , the characteristic frequencies of string vibrations are of the order of several mhz under the realistic experimental conditions.@xcite this means that the mechanically driven shuttle moves slowly in comparison with the characteristic times of electron motion , and the time dependent processes are adiabatic for the most part of the shuttling period .",
    "adiabaticity may be violated only when the shuttle approaches the metallic banks and tunneling amplitudes grow exponentially with time reaching its maximum for @xmath16 and then again decreasing to nearly zero value .",
    "thus the torque vibrations of a dumbbell - shape shuttle are transformed into periodically pulsing tunnel amplitudes with completely synchronized source - shuttle and shuttle - drain tunneling processes . due to non - adiabatic character of switching",
    ", this tunneling is accompanied by formation of quasienergy levels , which contribute to the single - electron shuttling .    to separate the single electron shuttling from kondo shuttling,@xcite we consider here spinless carriers .",
    "this approximation is valid provided the leads are fabricated from half - metals , i.e. materials in which the fermi surface is formed by majority spin electrons , whereas the spectrum of minority spin electrons is gapped @xcite .",
    "the turnstile shuttle ( ts ) may be described within a framework of time - dependent anderson model with the hamiltonian @xmath17 here the first term is hamiltonian of the moving ts @xmath18 @xmath19 is the occupation operator for the electrons in the wells of ts labeled as @xmath20 ; @xmath21 are the corresponding discrete energy levels . usually the time dependence is explicitly included in the shuttle coordinate,@xcite because the shuttle is driven by external electric field .",

    "the second term in eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) is the electrostatic interaction between electrons located in two potential wells .",
    "there is no need to introduce the single site coulomb blockade potential because the pauli principle forbids double occupation of any well .",

    "<S> the problem of electron transport by means of a dumbbell shaped shuttle in strong coulomb blockade regime is solved . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons may be shuttled only in the cotunneling regime during the time spans when both shoulders of the shuttle approach the metallic banks . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional anderson - like tunneling model is generalized for this case and the tunneling conductance is calculated in the adiabatic regime of slow motion of the shuttle . </S>",
