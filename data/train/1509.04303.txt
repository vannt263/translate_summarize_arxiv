    "the large multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) paradigm , known also as massive mimo  @xcite , is a promising technology for achieving higher throughput per area , which is necessary for next generation systems  @xcite . in particular , this concept employs multi - user mimo technniques , where the base station ( bs ) includes a large antenna array that results to the vanishment of both inter - user interference and thermal noise as the number of antennas increases due to channel orthogonality .    originally , most studies assume perfect channel state information ( csi ) ; however , this is a strong assumption , being untenable in practice . given that the performance depends on the quality of csi at the transmitter , it is of paramount importance to investigate realistic scenarios with imperfect csi , acquired during the uplink training phase in time - division - duplex ( tdd ) architectures  @xcite .",
    "one of the main sources contributing to imperfect knowledge of csi is channel aging , present in time - varying channels , that describes the mismatch between the estimated and current channels due to the relative movement between users and bs antennas . despite its crucial role ,",
    "it has not been studied in depth .",
    "specifically , the uplink and downlink signal - to - interference - and - noise - ratios ( sinrs ) have been derived by using a deterministic equivalent analysis after applying a maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) decoder and a maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) precoder , respectively  @xcite .",
    "furter investigation and comparison took place in  @xcite , where more sophisticated linear techniques were applied .",
    "moreover , the optimal linear receiver for cellular systems has been derived in  @xcite by exploiting the correlation between the channel estimates and the interference from other cells , and in  @xcite , the uplink analysis of a cellular network with zero - forcing ( zf ) receivers for any finite as well as infinite number of bs antennas has been provided .",
    "neverteless , tight lower bounds and the power scaling law have been studied for massive mimo with channel aging in  @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "the application of massive mimo is meaningful , if both hardware cost and power consumption are kept low . in such case ,",
    "hardware impairments become a significant degrading factor leading to imperfect csi . among the hardware imperfections , phase noise  @xcite , randomly phase shifting the output of the local oscillator ( lo ) , accumulates over time . unfortunately",
    ", it has been scarcely studied in the case of massive mimo systems , and mostly for uplink scenarios .",
    "specifically , the phase noise has been taken into account for single carrier uplink massive mimo by considering time - reversal mrc and zf in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in  @xcite , the achievable uplink user rate with mrc has been obtained by considering a general model with additive and multiplicative ( phase noise ) distortions , and it was shown that the phase noise can be alleviated in the large antenna limit .",
    "especially , regarding the downlink , an effort to address the effect of phase noise , being of great importance in large mimo systems , has taken place only in  @xcite .",
    "given that phase noise , being time dependent , contributes to channel aging , this work provides a novel model incorporating both effects of user mobility and phase noise .",
    "in fact , we present an insightful joint channel - phase noise model . in addition , we provide the deterministic equivalent of the downlink sinr with mrt .",
    "furthermore , the power scaling law has been studied in the case of user mobility combined with phase ( general channel aging conditions ) .",
    "numerical results reveal the impact of both effects in massive mimo for various mobility conditions and topologies of los . among the interesting observations , we mention that the effect of user mobility is more severe than phase noise , and the massive mimo technique keeps being favorable even in general time - varying conditions .",
    "we consider a single - cell system with a bs serving @xmath2 single - antenna non - cooperative users . in particular , the bs is deployed with an array of @xmath1 antennas .",
    "our study focuses on large scale networks , where both the number of antennas @xmath1 and users @xmath2 grow infinitely large , while keeping a finite ratio @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 with @xmath5 fixed such that @xmath6 .",
    "a realistic quasi - static fading model is taken into account , where the @xmath7 channel response vector between the bs and user @xmath8 during the @xmath9th symbol , is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "especially , @xmath10 exhibits flat fading , and it is assumed constant during the current symbol , but it may vary slowly from symbol to symbol . moreover , common effects such as path loss dependent on the distance of the users from the bs , and the spatial correlation due to limited antenna spacing , are considered by expressing the channel between as @xmath11 where @xmath12\\in \\bbc^{m \\times m}$ ] is a deterministic hermitian - symmetric positive definite matrix representing the aforementioned effects . the independence of @xmath13 by @xmath9 is a reasonable assumption , since effects such as spatial correlation and lognormal shadowing vary with time in a much slower pace than the coherence time  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath14 is an uncorrelated fast fading gaussian channel vector drawn as a realization from zero - mean circularly symmetric complex gaussian distribution , i.e. @xmath15 .      in practice , phase noise , induced during the up - conversion of the baseband signal to bandpass and vise - versa , impairs both the transmitter and the receiver , and it appears as a multiplicative factor to the channel vector .",
    "the cause is a distortion in phase due to the random phase drift of the generated carrier by the corresponding lo .",
    "our analysis regarding the @xmath9th time slot , takes into account for both synchronous and non - synchronous operation at the receiver .",
    "the latter setting assumes independent phase noise processes @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the phase noise process at the @xmath18th antenna .",
    "note that the phase noise processes are considered as mutually independent , since each antenna has its own oscillator , i.e. , separate independent los ( slos ) at each antenna .",
    "this setting can degenerate to identical phase noise processes , if the los are assumed identical ( ilos ) . in the synchronous scenario ,",
    "all the bs antennas are connected with a common lo ( clo ) , i.e. , there is only one phase noise process @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , we denote @xmath20 , @xmath21 the phase noise process at the single - antenna user @xmath8 .",
    "phase noise during the @xmath9th symbol can be described by a discrete - time independent wiener process , i.e. , the phase noises at the los of the @xmath18th antenna of the bs and @xmath8th user are modeled as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath25 , @xmath26 describes the phase noise increment variance with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 being the symbol interval , a constant dependent on the oscillator , and the carrier frequency , respectively .      in real systems obeying to the tdd architecture , the bs estimates the uplink channel  @xcite .",
    "the estimation occurs by means of an uplink training phase during each transmission block , where the transmission of pilot symbols takes place .",
    "the knowledge of the downlink channel is considered known due to the property of reciprocity .    by assuming that the channel estimation takes place at time @xmath30 , we now derive the joint channel - phase noise linear minimum mean - square error detector ( lmmse ) estimate of the effective channel @xmath31 under phase noise , small - scale fading , and channel impairments such as path loss and spatial correlation .",
    "note that @xmath32 is the phase noise because of the bs and user @xmath8 los at time @xmath30 with @xmath33 .",
    "the lmmse estimator of @xmath34 , obtained during the training phase , is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a noisy observation of the effective channel from user @xmath8 to the bs , and @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the power per user in the uplink data transmission phase and the duration of the training sequence during the training phase , respectively .    during the training phase @xmath40 ,",
    "all users transmit simultaneous mutually orthogonal pilot sequences consisting of length @xmath39 symbols .",
    "also , we assume that the effective channel remains constant during this phase . in particular , the pilot sequences can be represented by @xmath41 \\in \\bbc^{k \\times \\tau}$ ] with @xmath42 normalized , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "given that the channel estimation takes place at time @xmath30 , the received signal at the bs is written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the common average transmit power for all users , and @xmath46 is spatially white additive gaussian noise matrix at bs during this phase . by correlating the received signal with the training sequence @xmath47 of user @xmath8 ,",
    "the bs obtains @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "since we seek to find the joint channel - phase noise estimate , we denote the effective channel at time @xmath30 to be @xmath50 . after applying the mmse estimation method  @xcite ,",
    "the effective channel estimated at the bs can be written as in  .    employing the orthogonality principle",
    ", the current channel decomposes as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is distributed as @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the channel estimation error vector .",
    "note that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are statistically independent because they are uncorrelated and jointly gaussian .      the relative movement between the users and the bs results to a doppler shift , which makes the channel vary between when it is learnt by estimation , and when the estimate is applied for detection / precoding . the higher the velocity , the greater the performance loss because of worse channel estimation .",
    "the description of channel aging can be made by an autoregressive model of order @xmath58 , which relates the joint channel - phase noise process @xmath59 between the bs and the @xmath8th user at time @xmath9 ( current time ) to the estimated channel during the training phase .",
    "specifically , we have @xmath60 where , initially , @xmath61 is supposed to model 2-d isotropic scattering  @xcite is a scalar , since it is reasonably assumed that all antennas appear the same relative movement comparing to the user . ] , @xmath34 is the channel obtained during the training phase , and @xmath62 is the uncorrelated channel error vector due to the channel variation modelled as a stationary gaussian random process with i.i.d .",
    "entries and distribution @xmath63 .    since   allows to expresss the channel at time @xmath30 by means of its estimate ,",
    "the effective channel at time @xmath9 can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath52 are mutually independent . as far as @xmath66 is concerned , it is assumed known by the bs .",
    "interestingly , it incorporates the effects of 2-d isotropic scattering , user mobility , and phase noise , as shown by theorem  [ lmmse ] .",
    "consequently , useful outcomes can be extracted during the analysis in section  [ deterministic ] .",

    "<S> massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) is a promising technology aiming at achieving high spectral efficiency by deploying a large number of base station ( bs ) antennas using coherent combining . </S>",
    "<S> channel aging due to user mobility is a significant degrading factor of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , cost efficiency of massive mimo is a prerecuisite for their deployment , that leads to low cost antenna elements inducing high phase noise . since phase is time - dependent , it contributes to channel aging . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we present a novel joint channel - phase noise model , that enables us to study the downlink of massive mimo with maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) precoder under these conditions by means of the deterministic equivalent of the achievable sum - rate . among the noteworthy outcomes </S>",
    "<S> is that the degradation due to user mobility dominates over the effect of phase noise . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we demonstrate that the joint effects of phase noise and user mobility do not degrade the power scaling law @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the number of bs antennas ) , as has been established in massive mimo systems with imperfect channel state information .    channel estimation , doppler shift , phase noise , massive mimo , linear precoding . </S>"
