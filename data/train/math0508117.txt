    "during the fall semester of 2003 i was visiting the department of mathematics of the vanderbilt university , where i had the opportunity to continue my collaboration with ed saff .",
    "i was very excited with the evolution of the riemann - hilbert approach to the asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomials , and discussed extensively with ed the new perspectives .",
    "he was the one who posed the question : can this method tell us anything new about such a classical object as the orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle ( opuc , known also as szeg polynomials ) , in particular , about their zeros ?",
    "the question was more on a skeptical side .",
    "i was aware of some previous work of the founders of the method , @xcite , @xcite , but none of these papers was focused on the description of the zeros of the opuc s .",
    "so , we started to work and realized that we were able to find curious facts even in the simplest situations .",
    "later on i visited ken mclaughlin , at that time in chapel hill .",
    "a two - day discussion at strong caf ( a recommended place ) was crucial , and ken joined the team .",
    "this paper is a short and informal report on some of the advances we have had so far .",
    "let me introduce some notation and describe the setting",
    ". for @xmath0 , denote @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "a positive measure @xmath3 on @xmath4 has the lebesgue - radon - nikodym decomposition @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the singular part of @xmath3 with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath4 . throughout",
    ", we will consider measures satisfying the szeg condition @xmath7 allowing to define the _ szeg function _",
    "( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "x ,  10.2 ) ) : @xmath8 this function is piecewise analytic and non - vanishing , defined for @xmath9 , and we will denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 its values for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , given by formula . it is easy to verify that @xmath14 and for the boundary values we have @xmath15 the first equality in can be regarded as a wiener - hopf factorization of the weight @xmath16 , which is a key fact for the forthcoming analysis .    for a nontrivial positive measure @xmath3 on @xmath4",
    "there exists a unique sequence of polynomials @xmath17 , @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 we denote by @xmath20 the corresponding monic orthogonal polynomials .",
    "they satisfy the szeg recurrence @xmath21 where we use the standard notation @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 are called _ verblunsky coefficients _ ( also _ reflection coefficients _ or _ schur parameters _ ) and satisfy @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 is a bijection ; the map @xmath27 is an _ inverse problem _ , and it is known to be difficult . in @xcite there is a thorough discussion of several techniques to tackle this problem .",
    "recently , the riemann - hilbert approach , not described in @xcite , proved to be very promising in this context also ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is a further discussion of how this method can shed new light on the study of the asymptotics of the szeg polynomials .",
    "we are not going to provide detailed proofs that can be found elsewhere ( the references are included ) , the aim is to show the method in action and to discuss some new results in two apparently simple situations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : analytic ] is devoted to the case when @xmath28 is non vanishing and has an analytic extension across @xmath4 .",
    "the main role here is played by the _ _ scattering function _ _ is denoted in @xcite by @xmath29 , and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.2 ) by @xmath30 .",
    "it corresponds also to the scattering matrix in @xcite .",
    "i prefer to follow the notation of @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath31 meromorphic in an annulus , containing @xmath4 , and which , via its iterated cauchy transforms , allows to write some canonical series representing @xmath32 s .",
    "in this situation convergence is always exponentially fast , and the riemann - hilbert analysis is particularly simple and transparent . only some of the multiple corollaries of the canonical representation are discussed ; a more thorough analysis is contained in @xcite . in section [ sec : nonanalytic ] we look at the situation when the original analytic and nonvanishing weight has been modified by a factor having a finite number of zeros on the unit circle . now the behavior of the zeros of @xmath33 s is qualitatively different : most of them cluster at @xmath4 , and only a finite number stays within the disc @xmath34 .",
    "the method of section [ sec : analytic ] must be modified now in order to handle the zeros of the weight : a local analysis plays the major role .",
    "the exposition here is much more sketchy ; in this sense , more than a detailed view this window gives us a glimpse of the possible techniques and results . at any rate , the main goal is to persuade the reader that the riemann - hilbert analysis is a powerfull technique , that deserves to be in the toolbox of those interested in orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle .",
    "any analysis of opuc s can be started either from the orthogonality measure @xmath3 or from the sequence of the verblunsky coefficients @xmath35 .",
    "let us assume that the sequence of the verblunsky coefficients has an exponential decay : @xmath36 nevai - totik @xcite proved that this situation is characterized by the following conditions on @xmath3 : in the decomposition , @xmath37 , measure @xmath3 satisfies the szeg condition , and latexmath:[\\[\\label{def_r_bis } \\rho =   \\inf\\{0<r<1:\\ , d_{\\rm e}(w;z ) \\text { is holomorphic in }    be regarded as an analytic extension of the weight @xmath16 . with this definition of @xmath16 ( which we use in the sequel )",
    "we can say equivalently that @xmath39 and both circles @xmath40 and @xmath41 contain singularities of @xmath42 .",
    "in this situation the well - known szeg asymptotic formula @xmath43 can be continued analytically through the unit circle @xmath4 and is valid locally uniformly in @xmath44 .",
    "it shows that the number of zeros of @xmath45 on compact subsets of @xmath46 remains uniformly bounded , and these zeros are attracted by the zeros of @xmath11 in @xmath47 ( _ nevai - totik points _ in the terminology of b.  simon @xcite ) .",
    "numerical experiments show that the vast majority of zeros gather at the `` critical circle '' @xmath40 .",
    "this fact was justified theoretically by mhaskar and saff @xcite , who using potential theory arguments showed that for any subsequence @xmath48 satisfying @xmath49 the zeros of @xmath50 distribute asymptotically uniformly in the weak - star sense on @xmath40",
    ".    the behavior of the zeros inside @xmath51 can be intriguing .",
    "although approaching in mass the critical circle @xmath40 as predicted by mhaskar and saff , some of them still may remain inside and follow interesting patterns .",
    "even the convergence to the circle @xmath40 is different for different measures .",
    "can we give a full description of this behavior in terms of the weight of orthogonality ?",
    "the answer is positive , and the description will involve a sequence of iterates of certain hankel and toeplitz operators with symbols depending on the scattering function @xmath52 introduced in . it is a consequence of a canonical representation of the szeg polynomials , found by means of the riemann - hilbert characterization .      the starting point of all the analysis is the fact that under assumption conditions can be rewritten in terms of a non - hermitian orthogonality for @xmath32 and @xmath53 : @xmath54 here and in what follows , all the circles @xmath55 , @xmath56 , are oriented counterclockwise ; with this orientation we talk about the `` @xmath57 '' and the `` @xmath58 '' side of @xmath55 referring to its inner and outer boundary points , respectively .",
    "analogously , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the corresponding boundary values on @xmath55 for any function @xmath61 for which these limits exist . by standard arguments ( see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite , as well as the seminal paper @xcite where the riemann - hilbert approach to orthogonal polynomials started ) , @xmath62 is a unique solution of the following riemann - hilbert problem : @xmath63 is holomorphic in @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath67 identity matrix .",
    "this is the starting position for the steepest descent analysis as described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which consists in performing a series of _ explicit _ and _ reversible _ steps in order to arrive at an equivalent problem , which is solvable , at least in an asymptotic sense .",
    "since these steps are almost standard , they will be described very schematically .",
    "we will use the following notation : @xmath68 is the pauli matrix , and for any non - zero @xmath69 and integer @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "step 1 : define @xmath73 and put @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath75 is holomorphic in @xmath64 ; this transformation normalizes the behavior at infinity : @xmath76 .",
    "the price we pay is the oscillatory behavior of the new jump matrix on @xmath4 : @xmath77 we get rid of these oscillations in the next transformation , taking advantage of the analyticity of its entries in the annulus .",
    "step 2 : choose an arbitrary @xmath29 , @xmath78 , that we fix for what follows ; it determines the regions ( figure [ fig : nice_case1 ] ) @xmath79    nice_case1bis ( 79,24)@xmath4 ( 70,32)@xmath80 ( 90,17)@xmath81 ( 60,60)@xmath82 ( 69,69)@xmath83 ( 78,78)@xmath84 ( 90,90)@xmath85 ( 54,38)@xmath29 ( 27,10)@xmath86 ( 20,41)@xmath87    define @xmath88 , where @xmath89 then @xmath90 is holomorphic in @xmath91 . we have not modified its behavior at infinity , but now @xmath92 where @xmath93 the jump on @xmath80 and @xmath81 is exponentially close to the identity , which is convenient to our purposes .",
    "we have to deal now with the relevant jump on the unit circle .",
    "step 3 : the szeg functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 have been introduced in .",
    "define @xmath94 hence , if we introduce the geometric mean @xmath95{\\stackrel{\\text{\\tiny def}}{=}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\int_{0}^{2\\pi }   \\log\\left ( w\\left(e^{i\\theta } \\right)\\ , d\\theta \\right )   \\right)\\,,\\ ] ] then @xmath96\\right)^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the piece - wise analytic matrix - valued function @xmath97 is invertible , and has the same jumps on @xmath4 as @xmath98 .",
    "this motivates to make a new transformation , defining @xmath99 .",
    "matrix @xmath100 is holomorphic in @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 where @xmath104 our main character , @xmath52 , has entered the picture !    summarizing ,",
    "we have @xmath105 here @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are explicitly defined in , and , respectively .",
    "about @xmath100 we know only that it is piece - wise analytic and satisfies the jump condition . a feature of this situation is that we can write a formula for @xmath100 in terms of a series of iterates of some cauchy operators acting on the space of holomorphic functions in @xmath109 with continuous boundary values .",
    "indeed , let us denote @xmath110 and look at the equations given by the jumps on @xmath80 . according to",
    ", the first column is analytic across this circle , while the second column has an additive jump equal to the first column times @xmath111 .",
    "so , if we define the operator @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the exterior boundary values of the function @xmath61 on @xmath80 , then taking into account the behavior at infinity and sokhotsky - plemelj s theorem we get that @xmath114 analogously , with @xmath115 where @xmath113 denotes the exterior boundary values of the function @xmath61 on @xmath81 , we have again @xmath116 by , , functions @xmath117 satisfy the following integral equations : @xmath118 where @xmath66 is the identity operator .",
    "straightforward bounds show that there exists a constant @xmath119 depending on @xmath29 only , such that @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the @xmath122-norm on @xmath123 ; in the sequel we use @xmath124 to denote some irrelevant constants , different in each appearance , whose dependence or independence on the parameters will be stated explicitly .",
    "thus , we can invert these operators using convergent neumann series , @xmath125 in order to make this somewhat more explicit , let us define recursively two sequence of functions : @xmath126 then @xmath127 all these series are uniformly and absolutely convergent in their domains .",
    "moreover , straightforward bounds on the cauchy transform show that there exists a constant @xmath119 depending on @xmath29 only , such that for @xmath128 , @xmath129 we emphasize that in each of the regions above functions @xmath117 have their own meaning , and are not obtained in general by analytic continuation from one domain to another .",
    "once we have computed @xmath100 , we may replace its expression in in order to find @xmath63 .",
    "it should be performed independently in each region .",
    "for instance , in the domain @xmath85 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , so that @xmath133 analogous computations are easily completed in the rest of the regions .",
    "all the information about the parameters of the orthogonal polynomials is codified in the first column of @xmath63 : its @xmath134 entry gives us @xmath33 , that evaluated at @xmath135 yields the verblunsky coefficients , while the @xmath136 entry at @xmath135 is related to the leading coefficient @xmath137 : @xmath138 .",
    "hence , we have obtained the following theorem , that has been proved in @xcite :    [ thm : nice case ] let @xmath16 be a strictly positive analytic weight on the unit circle @xmath4 , the constant @xmath139 as defined in  , and constant @xmath29 with @xmath78 fixed . then with the notations introduced above , for every @xmath140 sufficiently large",
    "the following formulas hold : @xmath141    remark : it is easily seen that the method we have just described is valid also if we replace the condition of positivity of @xmath16 on @xmath4 by the requirement that its winding number on @xmath4 is zero . in such a case",
    "we can assure that @xmath142 only for sufficiently large @xmath143 s , but the rest of the argument remains the same .    before we analyze some implications of these formulas let us look more carefully at the scattering function @xmath52 and at the iterates of its cauchy transforms used in the definition of @xmath100 .",
    "following notation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.2 ) , let @xmath144 be the laurent expansion ( equivalently , the fourier series ) for @xmath145 . then straightforward computation shows that @xmath146 let @xmath147 be the laurent expansions of @xmath52 and @xmath148 in the annulus @xmath149 , respectively .",
    "taking into account that @xmath150 on @xmath4 , @xmath151 denote by @xmath152 the hardy class , and @xmath153 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath154 and @xmath155 the riesz projections onto @xmath152 and @xmath156 , respectively , and @xmath157 .",
    "then @xmath158 in particular , @xmath159 the series in the right hand side converge locally uniformly . observe also that @xmath160    if we introduce the following composition of hankel and toeplitz operators , having @xmath161 as a symbol , @xmath162 then @xmath163 where @xmath164 represents the values of @xmath165 in @xmath166 .    for @xmath167 we can obtain analogous formulas : @xmath168 and @xmath169 for instance , taking into account , for @xmath170 , @xmath171 and by identities in we can rewrite last formula as @xmath172    remarks : there are some further relations and equivalent expressions that an interested reader can easily derive .",
    "for instance , if we introduce the operator @xmath173 on @xmath174 with kernel @xmath175 then @xmath176 and we can obtain expressions for @xmath177 and @xmath178 .      representation is asymptotic in nature . using , it is immediate to show that for all sufficiently large @xmath143 and for @xmath179 , @xmath180 where the constant @xmath181 depends only on @xmath29 and @xmath108 , but neither on @xmath143 nor on @xmath182 .",
    "analogously , @xmath183 where @xmath181 has a similar meaning as above .",
    "these bounds show that allows us to obtain approximations of @xmath184 of an arbitrarily high order .",
    "we will concentrate only on the most interesting domain including the critical circle @xmath40 and its interior ( for a full analysis , check @xcite ) .",
    "let us discuss the consequences of truncating @xmath185 and @xmath186 in at their first terms , @xmath187 imposing some additional conditions on the analytic continuation of our weight @xmath16 ( or function @xmath52 ) .",
    "we assume first that the critical circle @xmath40 contains only isolated singularities in a finite number .",
    "[ prop : residues ] assume that there exists @xmath188 such that @xmath11 can be continued to the exterior of the circle @xmath189 , as an analytic function whose only singularities are on the circle @xmath190 , and these are all isolated .",

    "( i ) _ establishing zero - free regions for the approximation , and _",
    "( ii ) _ bounding @xmath203 away from zero using the error estimates . similarly , isolating the zeros can be done by first isolating the zeros of the approximation , and then using a rouche type argument for @xmath203 .",
    "this theorem tells us that in general all the relevant information for the asymptotics of @xmath33 s in @xmath204 comes from the singularities of the exterior szeg function @xmath11 on @xmath40 ( that is , from the first singularities of @xmath11 we meet continuing it analytically inside the unit disc ) , and reduces the asymptotic analysis of @xmath33 s ( at least , in the first approximation ) to the study of the behavior of the corresponding residues . in the case when all the singular points that we met on @xmath40 are poles , this analysis is more or less straightforward .",

    "this is also an analogue of the interlacing property of the zeros of orthogonal polynomials on the real line .",
