    "understanding the behavior of interacting dynamical systems is a long standing problem .",
    "main efforts focused on dynamical systems interacting in a lattice , and with a mean field coupling @xcite .",
    "typical attempts establish the existence of an absolutely continuous invariant measure , see for example @xcite .",
    "more recently , the attention has shifted towards more general and irregular networks of coupled maps @xcite .",
    "the last decade has witnessed a rapidly growing interest in dynamics on spaces with complex topology .",
    "this interest is partly motivated by results showing that the structure of a network can dramatically influence the dynamical properties of the system , but also because many , disparate , real - world networks share a common feature  heterogeneity in the interaction structure @xcite .",
    "this suggests a network structure in which most nodes have degree close to the minimum , while some high - degree nodes , termed _ hubs _ , are present and have greater impact upon the network functioning .",
    "recent work has suggested the ability of networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution to present degree dependent collective behavior @xcite .",
    "hubs may undergo a transition to coherence whereas the remaining nodes behave incoherently .",
    "the dynamical properties among the hubs play a central role in many realistic networks .",
    "there is evidence that the dynamics of hub neurons coordinate and shape the network in a developing hippocampal network @xcite , and play a major role in epileptic seizures @xcite .",
    "recent efforts to understand the dynamics of the hubs concentrated mainly on numerical investigations @xcite .",
    "the description of the dynamical properties of the hubs remains elusive .",
    "it remains unknown how hub dynamics depends on various network parameters such as the dynamics of the isolated nodes , and the structure of the network .",
    "revealing the dynamics of the hubs in relation to the graph structure is an important step toward understanding complex behavior and unveiling the topological implications on the network functioning .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of coupled expanding circle maps on a heterogeneous random network .",
    "we provide a probabilistic approach to describe effective dynamics of the massively connected nodes in a weak interaction limit .",
    "we show that for almost every random network and almost all initial conditions the high dimensional network problem governing the dynamics of the massively connected nodes can be reduced to a few macroscopic equations .",
    "such reduction is intimately related to the ergodic properties of the expanding maps .",
    "this reduction allows one to explore the coherent properties of the network .",
    "our analysis reveals that the intrinsic properties of the node dynamics also play a major role and may hinder or enhance coherence .",
    "our main object of study is the network dynamics of coupled maps . _",
