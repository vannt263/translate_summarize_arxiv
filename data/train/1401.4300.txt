    "double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) is a linear semiflexible polymer chain with persistence lengths of about 150 base pairs ( bp ) ( @xmath2 nm ) and cross - section diameter of about @xmath3 nm . in aqueous solutions dna molecules are highly negatively charged due to dissociated phosphate groups along the chain backbone that confer to b - form ds - dna a bare base - pair charge of @xmath4 per 0.34 nm length of dna , engendering strong repulsive interactions along and between dna molecules @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , under specific solution conditions dna molecules can be induced to condense into highly compact structures that phase separate from the solution @xcite . in these condensates dna",
    "is in a liquid crystalline state @xcite with lattice spacings close to measured spacings in bulk dna liquid crystals at the same solution conditions @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of semiflexible polymer condensation is not specific to dna only but can be observed in other semiflexible polyelectrolytes as well , e.g. f - actin filaments @xcite .",
    "the morphology of these condensates varies depending on the method of preparation @xcite as well as on the dynamics of the nucleation and growth of the condensate @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will make the simplifying assumption that the condensate morphology is an equilibrium property , eventually reached after different nucleation and growth relaxation processes are over , and study the consequences .",
    "previous attempts at a theoretical analysis of dna condensation in the presence of various condensing agents shed light on the resulting ordered nematic dna structure often in the form of toroidal and/or rodlike globules @xcite .",
    "different aspects of this collapse transition have been scrutinized in order to deduce the detailed geometry of the aggregate and the corresponding phase diagram @xcite as well as their dependence on the assumed form of the elastic energy and the dna - dna or dna - condensing agent interaction @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will revisit the problem of the stability and phase diagram of the various condensed structures of dna in light of the recent understanding of the interactions driving the condensation transition in the case of polyvalent counterions and osmoticants , as well as the emerging details of the non - linear nature of the dna elastic energy .",
    "the theoretical approach advocated here , combined with monte carlo simulations , provides a simple and unified foundation on which the effects of various components of the dna condensation phenomenon can be compared and assessed .",
    "when condensed in a very dilute solution , the most commonly observed dna condensate morphologies are torus - like and rod - like ( see figs.[fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "a typical compact structure has the size of approximatively @xmath5 nm , with an inner hole about @xmath6 nm wide in the case of the toroidal aggregate .",
    "it is found to be relatively robust with respect to the length of the dna involved in the condensation .",
    "the packing of dna strands inside the condensed structure is highly ordered with a predominantly hexagonal packing in the plane perpendicular to the toroidal main axis @xcite .",
    "the condensation can be induced by a variety of _ condensing agents_. among these flexible polymers , such as peg ( poly - ethylene - glycol ) , at large enough concentrations , the presence of salt ( psi - condensation = ( p)olymer and ( s)alt ( i)nduced condensation ) induces condensation of both dna as well as f - actin filaments @xcite .",
    "the mechanism here appears to be osmotic depletion interactions @xcite due to the exclusion of the polymer from the dna subphase .",
    "more commonly exploited condensation agents in various biological settings are the multivalent counterions .",
    "in fact many , but not all , multivalent cations induce ds - dna condensation .",
    "those that do condense ds - dna at finite concentrations are mn@xmath7 , cd@xmath7 , co(nh@xmath8)@xmath9 , polyamines such as spermidine@xmath9 , spermine@xmath10 , polylysine@xmath11 and all the higher valency ( poly)counterions . that electrostatics plays an important role in dna condensation is clear but it is just as clear that it can not be the only factor driving it @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a radical reformulation of the theory of electrostatic interactions is needed @xcite , based on the concept of the `` strong - coupling '' electrostatics between the multivalent salt counterions and the charges on the dna backbone , in order to understand the counterintuitive change in sign of interactions between nominally equally charged bodies @xcite .    while electrostatics should play an important role in the dna condensation mechanism",
    ", it can not be the sole and sometimes not even the dominant factor affecting it .",
    "for instance @xmath12 is more efficient in condensing dna than spermidine@xmath9 , both being trivalent counterions , and the best condensing agents appear to be those that bind into one of the dna grooves @xcite .",
    "these well documented ion specific effects @xcite furthermore suggest that interaction of condensing ions with water molecules , i.e. hydration interactions , provide the necessary specificity that is absent in condensation interactions based exclusively on coulomb interaction [ for a recent review of hydration effects see ref ] .",
    "apart from the polymer depletion and `` strong - coupling '' electrostatic interactions , a fundamental ingredient of any theory of semiflexible polymer condensation is their significant stiffness that frustrates the formation of a spherical globule @xcite . without any stiffness effects",
    ", one would expect that the spherical globule would be the ground state of a flexible polymer by minimizing its surface energy @xcite .",
    "indeed , the local structure of this condensed phase consists of straight chains with parallel nematic alignment to minimize the bending energy . however , even within this simple picture , it is not clear why this particular structure is necessarily favored with respect to other structures  such as , for instance , a rod - like structure  having similar characteristics . nor is the role of the concrete form of the elastic energy as well as the interactions between dna molecules that induce the condensation well understood .    in this paper",
    "we will address these issues using simple analytical arguments supported by numerical simulations , and discuss under what conditions the toroidal condensate is favored with respect to a rod - like counterpart .",
    "we will include the bending energy , the surface energy and the detailed interaction energy between polymer molecules in our _ _ ansatz _",
    "_ for the free energy whose minimization will provide us with the equilibrium configuration of the condensate .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we first present the model with the corresponding packing geometry , and the non - equilibrium curvature , surface and interaction free energies written for the dominant configurations of a toroid and a spherocylinder .",
    "we then proceed to the analytical minimization of the total free energy for the toroidal and rod - like aggregate that we compare with monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we finally explore the effect of various interaction models and generalize the elastic energy _ _ ansatz _ _ to the case of an intrinsic threshold .",
    "we conclude with a commentary on previous works and with an assessment on the validity of our approach .",
    "we consider a semiflexible polymer of length @xmath0 formed by @xmath13 spherical beads of diameter @xmath14 .",
    "the bond length between consecutive beads is also taken to be equal to @xmath14 for simplicity .",
    "a conformation of the polymer is given by the positions of the beads @xmath15 .",
    "we furthermore assume that all the energies involved in condensate morphology are sufficiently large so that entropic terms can be neglected .",
    "hence we expect a compact phase for which only curvature , surface and interaction energy terms are present .      in our model",
    "the polymer chain fills the condensate interior and is locally hexagonally packed .",
    "consider a tessellation of a plane perpendicular to the long axes of the polymer , having a schlfli symbol @xcite @xmath16 .",
    "for hexagonal packing the schlfli symbol is @xmath17 . the hexagonal packing fraction @xcite @xmath18 for the case of hexagonal close packing ( @xmath19 ) is then given by @xmath20 if the packing of polymers inside the aggregate is still hexagonal but not at the highest close packing fraction @xmath21 , where the separation between the polymer chains is equal to @xmath22 , then @xmath23 and the packing fraction is given by : @xmath24 the hexagonal packing symmetry is thus still preserved but at a lower packing fraction .",
    "this will be important when we introduce soft interactions between polymer segments .      within the worm - like chain model @xcite the elastic bending free energy",
    "is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ( reduced ) stiffness , @xmath27 is the angle between @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the energies are assumed to be in units of thermal energy @xmath31 , so that both @xmath32 and @xmath26 are dimensionless variables .",
    "here @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath34 the absolute temperature , and we denote as @xmath35 the persistence length of the chain . if @xmath36 is the radius of curvature at the bead @xmath37 , i.e. the radius of the circle through @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , it is easy to show that @xmath41    assume that the chain forms a toroid of the mean radius @xmath42 and radius of the cross - section @xmath43 with @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the limiting case @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) would correspond to a swollen conformation whereas @xmath47 would correspond to a `` globular '' conformation with no inner hole inside the torus ( not a sphere ) .    in the simplest case",

    "( [ sec2:eq1 ] ) in the large @xmath13 limit then simplifies to @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "note that our constant radius of curvature approximation follows the model proposed in ref . which claimed to predict a correct toroid size distribution .",
    "this approximation may not be fully consistent with our previous assumption on the hexagonal packing .",
    "thus , we assume that the latter is not rigorously valid but only essentially correct .",
    "an alternative model of dna organization inside the condensates based on perfect hexagonal packing @xcite yields similar expression for bending energy but only in the limit of thin condensate .    .",

    "( [ sec1:eq2 ] ) by the ratio of the occupied to the total surface @xmath54 in order to compare low - energy configurations with different geometries , we need to translate the typical length scale of the problem ( @xmath42 in this case ) to the contour length @xmath0 of the polymer that is common to all configurations . in the present case , we have @xmath55 thus we end up with @xmath56 inserting eq .",

    "consider now the rod - like structure sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] as another possible low energy conformation competing with the toroid .",
    "we assume a spherocylindrical shape for the dna condensate with circular cross - section of radius @xmath42 and length @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "the limiting case @xmath65 again corresponds to a `` globular '' conformation , albeit different from the previous one . within this compact structure",
    "the polymer chain folds in such a way that parallel segments are hexagonally packed in the main body of the structure and there are loops only at the two spherical caps ( see fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) .        as in the previous case",
    ", a relation between the length @xmath0 of the dna polymer and the characteristic geometry scale @xmath42 of the rod - like condensate can be found hinging upon simple geometrical considerations .",
    "the total length @xmath0 of the polymer is the sum of two parts : the straight part in the cylinder body @xmath66 , and the loop part in the two spherical caps @xmath67 that can be estimated as @xmath68 in the above equations , the length is estimated as volume times the packing fraction of the condensate divided by cross section area of the polymer .",
    "thus , @xmath69 within the same rationale followed for the toroidal conformation , we assume each loop to have a constant radius of curvature @xmath70 so that the bending and the surface energy for the rod - like conformation have the following form    @xmath71    use of eq .",

    "we have not yet considered the actual interactions between neighboring polymer segments but our approach can be easily generalized to include them .",
    "these interactions can be included on a general poor - solvent level @xcite , on the detailed level of explicit electrostatic interactions @xcite or on a phenomenological level based on experimentally determined effective potentials @xcite .",
    "we opt for the latter as the poor - solvent level seems to be too generic while the details of the exact dna - dna electrostatic interactions are still incompletely understood @xcite .",
    "an important reason for sticking to the phenomenological level is that the measured interactions of course contain all the interaction free energy contributions , including the water mediated hydration interaction @xcite that do not feature explicitly in model expressions of the poor - solvent or indeed at the electrostatic level .",

    "the total interaction energy between all segments of the chain is then in general given by : @xmath89 as this is difficult to evaluate explicitly we introduce an approximation at this point by considering only the segments that are nearest neighbors and locally straight .",
    "this approximation works fine for short range interactions .",
    "this yields @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of nearest neighbor pairs having distance @xmath22 between the polymer segments . for the assumed hexagonal local packing symmetry",
    "the number of nearest neighbors per segment is 6 inside the condensate and 4 on its surface .",
    "as the interactions are partitioned between two neighbors , each segment contributes only half of its interaction energy to the total energy .",
    "the total number of residues is @xmath92 whereas the number of residues on the surface of the condensate equals to @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the condensate s surface area .",

    "the effective interactions between polymer segments include the depletion interaction contribution to osmotic pressure , which is attractive , stemming from the flexible polymers in solution @xcite , and acts on top of a short range repulsive interaction of either electrostatic or hydration origin @xcite .",
    "the components of the interaction energy should thus be a repulsive part and an attractive part that should look like @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the osmotic pressure of the external polymer solution and @xmath100 is the overlap of the excluded volume of dna in the condensate @xcite : @xmath101 let s denote @xmath102 the size of the condensing agent molecule ( in our case the peg ) .",
    "the overlap volume can be estimated as @xmath103 where the first term corresponds to the excluded volume of the polymer in an open conformation , the second term corresponds to the volume of the condensate ( presumably to be fully excluded from the osmoticants ) , the third term corresponds to the excluded volume of the condensate s surface , and @xmath94 is the surface area of the condensate ( either toroidal or rod - like ) . using eq .",

    "our results clearly shows that the ratio of the toroid diameter to toroid thickness strongly depends on the solvent condition as given by the energy parameter @xmath79 .",
    "the poorer the solvent , the smaller is the toroid diameter . our model could be used to infer the interaction energy between base pairs from experimental data of toroid sizes for various solvent conditions .",

    "for the toroidal condensate , the energy takes the following form : @xmath210 where @xmath91 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nc ] ) and @xmath100 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v0 ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for a given @xmath22 , the energy is minimized at the value of @xmath133 given by @xmath211 with @xmath212 .",
    "similarly for the rod - like condensate , the equation for @xmath181 is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) with the new @xmath187 as in the above equation .",
    "note that in order for the toroid to be stable , @xmath187 should be positive , this leads to the following condition for the osmotic pressure : @xmath213 where the minimum is taken over all @xmath22 satisfying @xmath214 .",

    "[ fig : fig11 ] and [ fig : fig12 ] show the phase diagram and the dependence of toroid diameter on toroid thickness for the case with depletion potential .",
    "note that phase separation line well follows the @xmath1 law , and the stronger osmotic pressure , the smaller sizes of toroids are formed .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained with the morse potential and the hard - core interaction case",
    ". therefore the detailed form of the interaction potential , while being important for the equation of state of dna @xcite , has only a small effect on the location of the transition lines and on the length dependence of the various phases themselves .",
    "up to now we have only considered the variations in the interaction potential on the phase diagram of the condensate .",
    "inspired by the tube model of a polymer @xcite , we finally also consider a variation in the form of the bending energy of the polymer .",
    "specifically we intend to introduce modifications in the @xmath218 dependence of the curvature energy .",
    "assume first that the curvature energy vanishes for @xmath219 and becomes @xmath220 otherwise .",
    "the ensuing radius of curvature is in this case also limited by a corresponding lower bound @xmath221 @xmath222 or @xmath223    under these assumptions , the polymer will try to make very large turns ( i.e. large radius of curvature ) in order to have @xmath224 .",
    "hence a rod - like structure , where short turns are unavoidable , will then be consequently highly unfavorable , as further elaborated below .    when the condition ( [ sec4:eq2 ] ) is met , the total energy coincides with surface energy only , so that @xmath225 in the same form as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : storoid ] ) . from the above equation one can see that for a given length @xmath0 the minimum energy is obtained when both @xmath53 and @xmath96 are at their maximum values , i.e. @xmath135 and @xmath131 . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rb ] ) it is clear that for a given @xmath0 , @xmath96 is maximum when @xmath42 is minimum , thus one obtains the following equation for @xmath133 : @xmath226 the above equation has a solution @xmath139 only if @xmath227 in other words , the toroid can be a minimum energy configuration only when @xmath228 . for @xmath229 the minimum energy",
    "would be a globule ( @xmath180 ) . because there is no bending energy , the globule would be always favored compared to the rod - like conformation , having the lowest surface energy .",
    "it then follows that within this model , only two phases are possible : the toroid phase for length @xmath230 and the globule phase for @xmath231 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ) .",
    "here @xmath232 is the smallest length necessary to form a globule and can be determined from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ll0 ] ) and ( [ sec4:eq2 ] ) as @xmath233    .",

    "[ fig : fig13 ] .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram of semi - flexible polymers with self - attraction as a function of the stiffness and the contour length of the chain .",
    "this is a prototypical model for dna condensation , a problem with a long history that is still not completely understood .",
    "we have combined analytical arguments with extensive monte carlo simulations , to study the competition between toroidal and rod - like configurations as candidates for the ground state of the condensate at increasing stiffness of the polymer molecules .",
    "as the stiffness increases , we find an increasing tendency for the polymers to achieve a nematic alignment in order to minimize the bending energy .",
    "this typically favours first a transition from a globular to a rod - like conformation , and then a further transition to a toroidal conformation that is then the most stable one at sufficiently large stiffness values .",
    "this scenario appears to be rather robust irrespective of the details of the interaction potential between the segments of the molecules , provided that the polymer chain is sufficiently long .    in the stiffness - length plane",
    ", we furthermore found a robust @xmath1 dependence of the transition line between the rod - like and the toroidal phases , that can be simply explained within our analytical approach .",
    "an additional @xmath198 dependence was also observed for the toroid radius . while the existence of some of these scaling laws has been known for some time ,",
    "see the work of grosberg and zhestkov ref .",
    ", a comprehensive analysis combining an analytical approach with numerical simulations has been , to the best of our knowledge , still missing .",
    "our work fills this gap .",
    "finally , our conclusions are in good agreement also with very recent molecular dynamics simulations @xcite that studied the dynamics of a polymer chain collapse in poor solvents as a function of the chain flexibility .",
    "we assessed the importance of the exact form of the interaction potential , as extracted from experiments , while constructing models for polyvalent salt condensed dna as well as polymer and salt induced dna condensation .",
