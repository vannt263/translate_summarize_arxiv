    "during the past half - decade categorification and , in particular , that of topological invariants has flourished into a subject of its own right .",
    "it has been a study finding connections and ramifications over a vast spectrum of mathematics , including areas such as low - dimensional topology , representation theory , algebraic geometry , as well as others .",
    "following the original work of m. khovanov on the categorification of the jones polynomial in @xcite , came a spew of link homology theories lifting other quantum invariants . with a construction that utilized a tool previously developed in an algebra - geometric context , matrix factorizations , m. khovanov and l. rozansky produced the @xmath0 and homfly - pt link homology theories . albeit computationally intensive , it was clear from the onset that thick interlacing structure was hidden within .",
    "the most insightful and influential work in uncovering these innerconnections was that of j. rasmussen in @xcite , where he constructed a spectral sequence from the homfly - pt to the @xmath0-link homology .",
    "this was a major step in deconstructing the pallet of how these theories come together , yet many structural questions remained and still remain unanswered , waiting for a new approach .",
    "close to the time of the original work , m. khovanov produced an equivalent categorification of the homfly - pt polynomial in @xcite , but this time using hochschild homology of soergel bimodules and rouquier complexes of @xcite .",
    "the latter proved to be more computation - friendly and was used by b. webster to calculate many examples in @xcite .    in the meantime ,",
    "a new flavor of categorification came into light . with the work of a. lauda and m. khovanov on the categorification of quantum groups in @xcite , a diagrammatic calculus originating in the study of @xmath1-categories arrived into the foreground .",
    "this graphical approach proved quite fruitful and was soon used by b. elias and m. khovanov to rewrite the work of soergel in @xcite , and en suite by b. elias and the author to repackage rouquier s complexes and to prove that they are functorial over braid - cobordisms @xcite ( not just projectively functorial as was known before ) .",
    "an immediate advantage to this construction was the inherent ease of calculation , at least comparative ease , and the fact that it worked equally well over the integers as well as over fields .    as there has yet to be seen an integral version of either homfly - pt or @xmath0-link homology , with the original khovanov homology being defined over @xmath2 and torsion playing an interesting role , a natural question arose as to whether this graphical calculus could be used to define these .",
    "the definition of such integral theories is precicely the purpose of this paper .",
    "the one immediate disadvantage to the graphical approach is that at the present moment there does not exist a diagrammatic calculus for the hochschild homology of soergel bimodules .",
    "hence , to define integral homfly - pt homology , our paper takes a rather roundabout way , jumping between matrix factorizations and diagrammatic rouquier complexes whenever one is deemed more advantageous than the other . for the @xmath0 version of the story",
    ", we add the rasmussen spectral sequence into the mix and essentially repeat his construction in our context .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : in section [ sec - toolkit ] we give a brief account of the necessary tools ( matrix factorizations , soergel bimodules , hochschild homology , rouquier complexes , and corresponding diagrammatics ) - the emphasis here is brevity and we refer the reader to more original sources for particulars and details ; in sections [ sec - complex ] and [ sec - rmoves ] we describe the intergal homfly - pt complex and prove the reidemeister moves , utilizing all of the background in [ sec - toolkit ] ; section [ sec - ss ] is devoted to the rasmussen spectral sequence and integral @xmath0-link homology , and we conclude it with some remarks and questions .    throughout the paper",
    "we will refer to a positive crossing as the one labelled @xmath3 and negative crossing as the one labelled @xmath4 in figure [ resolutions ] . for resolutions of a crossing we will refer to @xmath5 and @xmath6 of figure [ resolutions ] as the  oriented \" and  singular \" resolutions , respectively .",
    "we will use the following conventions for the homlfy - pt polynomial    @xmath7    with p of the unknot being @xmath8 .",
    "substuting @xmath9 we arrive at the quantum @xmath0-link polynomial .",

    "we will require some knowledge of matrix factorizations , soergel bimodules and rouquier complexes , as well as the corresponding diagrammatic calculus of elias and khovanov @xcite . in this section the reader will find a brief survery of the necessary tools , and for more details we refer him to the following papers : for matrix factorizations @xcite , @xcite , for soergel bimodules and rouquier complexes and diagrammatics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and for hochschild homology @xcite , @xcite .",

    "a useful and easy exercise is the following :    given two matrix factorizations @xmath12 and @xmath17 with potenials @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , the tensor product @xmath21 is a matrix factorization with potential @xmath24 .    following rasmussen @xcite , we work with @xmath2-graded , rather than @xmath25-graded , matrix factorizations as in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-grading implies that @xmath16 is equivalent to @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the case that @xmath28 , we acquire a new @xmath25-graded chain complex structure with differential @xmath29 . supressing the underlying ring @xmath10 and potential @xmath14 , we will denote the category of graded matrix factorizations by @xmath30 .",
    "we also need the notion of complexes of matrix factorizations .",
    "if we visualize a collection of matrix factorizations as sitting horizontally in the plane at each integer level , with differentials @xmath19 and @xmath20 running right and left , respectively , we can think of morphisms @xmath31 between these as running in the vertical direction .",

    "in addition we will be taking tensor products of complexes of matrix factorizations ( in the obvious way ) and , just to add to the confusion we will also have homotopies of these complexes as well homotopies of matrix factorizations themselves .",

    "the generating pictures above may exist in various colors , although there are some restrictions based on adjacency conditions .",

    "this is legitimate , as only the various adjacency relations between colors are relevant for any relations or calculations .",
    "we will specify adjacency for all pictures , although one can generally deduce it from the fact that 6-valent vertices only join adjacent colors , and 4-valent vertices join only distant colors .",
    "in addition to the bimodules @xmath76 above , we will require the use of the bimodule @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the ring of invariants under the transpositions @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and will use a black squiggly line , as in equation [ decomp2d ] below , to represent it .",

    "the functor gives an equivalence of categories between this diagrammatic category and the subcategory @xmath42 of @xmath10-bimodules mentioned in the previous section , so the use of the same name is legitimate .",
    "our diagrammatic category has many wonderful properties , such as the self - adjointness of @xmath43 , which permits us to  twist \" morphisms around and view any morphism as one from or to the empty diagram .",
    "this allows for a very hands - on , explicit , understanding of hom - paces between objects in @xmath42 , which was key in proving functoriality in @xcite .",
    "primarily we will work in another category denoted @xmath94 , the category formally containing all direct sums and grading shifts of objects in @xmath42 , but whose morphisms are forced to be degree 0 .",
    "in addition , we let @xmath95 be the karoubi envelope , or idempotent completion , of the category @xmath94 .",
