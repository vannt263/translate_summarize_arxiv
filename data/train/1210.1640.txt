    "with the recent detections of possible terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of other stars by the kepler mission ( lissauer et al . , 2012 )",
    "a question arises : to what extent could these remote worlds support life similar to what we know here on earth ( terrestrial - type life ) ?",
    "there are many conditions for a planet to fulfil to support terrestrial - type life , which can be controlled by either geological , climatological , orbital , or geophysical processes . in this study ,",
    "the first in a series , we focus on the dynamical factors that may affect the habitability of a terrestrial exoplanet .",
    "we identify several key features that we believe are important , if not essential , for supporting terrestrial - type life .",
    "these are i ) a stable climate , ii ) low to moderate ( @xmath13 50@xmath4 ) seasonal temperature variations , iii ) low to moderate diurnal temperature variations , and iv ) low to moderate spatial variation of temperature over the planet .",
    "these conditions need to be supplemented with the following : v ) regular , low - amplitude obliquity oscillations , vi ) moderate obliquity to induce seasonal variations , vii ) moderate rotation rate , and viii ) small orbital perturbations .",
    "we examine each of these below . + for the current earth , the first condition requires a constant obliquity and a low eccentricity .",
    "earth s life is both land - based and water - based and requires a stable climate over millions or even billions of years .",
    "in addition to continental drift the long - term climate on the earth is largely regulated by the milankovi cycles ( milankovi , 1941 ) .",
    "these cycles are related to variations in earth s orbit and their influence on the obliquity .",
    "the main cycles are related to its equatorial precession ( with period 26  kyr , corresponding to a frequency @xmath14 - 50.5  ",
    "/yr , where @xmath15 is the angle between the vernal equinox and the intersection of the equator with the ecliptic ) , the obliquity variations of the earth ( with period 41  kyr , corresponding to the frequency @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the earth s nodal eigenfrequency ) , and the orbital eccentricity ( with periods 100  kyr and 400  kyr , corresponding to frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the eccentricity eigenfrequencies of venus and jupiter respectively ) .",
    "the present obliquity variations of the earth are small : the amplitude is just 1.5@xmath4 , and the low amplitude is a result of the presence of the moon",
    ". however , even these small oscillations are enough to cause regular ice ages through the positive feedback effect ( deser et al . , 2000 ) . + the second condition that is necessary to make the planet desirable for terrestrial - type life leans on the following .",
    "spiegel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have shown that the polar regions of a planet with perpendicular spin are mostly uninhabitable because of the lack of seasons : the cold regions will mostly stay cold , possibly even below freezing . on earth the onset of the ice ages tends to favour low obliquity for two reasons : the reduction in overall summer insolation at high latitudes and the corresponding reduction in mean insolation ( huybers & wunsch , 2005 ) .",
    "the cooling would result in more ice building up near the polar caps , increasing the albedo which then instigates a positive feedback effect .",
    "however , there are other theories that show that precession and eccentricity forcing on the insolation also play a role ( e.g. imbrie & imbrie , 1980 ; paillard , 1997 ; huybers , 2011 ) and the debate is ongoing .",
    "the weak seasonal effects at low obliquity and the corresponding constant low temperatures at high latitudes may imply that habitability is increased for planets that have a moderate obliquity because the associated seasons make the polar regions partly habitable by increasing the yearly mean insolation , and thus the temperature .",
    "however , too high an obliquity may not be favourable for habitability either ( williams & kasting 1997 ; williams & pollard , 2003 ; spiegel et al . , 2009 ) because the long summers at the poles could cause large seasonal temperature variations above large continents ( williams & pollard , 2003 ) and the highest temperatures could exceed 50  @xmath4  c. additionally the long periods of darkness even at mid latitudes could cause difficulties for photosynthetic life to survive .",
    "thus it appears that the current obliquity favours the development of terrestrial - type life rather than more extreme values .",
    "+ the third condition , a low to moderate diurnal temperature variation , is regulated by a sufficiently slow rotation rate , a thick atmosphere and oceans .",
    "diurnal temperature changes are partially governed by the relaxation time scale for atmospheric heat losses and temperature variations . on the earth",
    "this time scale is 20 days ( matsuda , 2000 ) and the diurnal temperature variation is approximately 10  k. for mars the story is very different : the relaxation time is comparable to its rotation period and the diurnal temperature variation is approximately 60  k ( matsuda , 2000 ) .",
    "part of the reason the diurnal variation on mars is much higher than on earth is because the latter s oceans store heat much more effectively than land and mars atmosphere is much more tenuous .",
    "however , a very slow rotation will cause the hadley cell to cover the whole planet ( farrell , 1990 ) and the diurnal temperature variations may be diminished",
    ". a fast rotation , on the other hand , would decrease the heat transport as argued in the next paragraph . by themselves",
    "these temperature changes may not pose a problem but , coupled with the seasonal variations , they may be difficult for land - based life to adapt to .",
    "+ the fourth condition , low to moderate spatial variation of temperature over the planet , can be the result of the following .",
    "simulations of global circulation models on an earth - like planet with different rotation rates have shown that for a fast rotating earth the atmosphere experiences the creation of many small hadley - like cells ( williams , 1988a ) and most of the heat transport is caused by baroclinic eddies .",
    "these eddies decrease the efficiency of heat transportation from the warmer regions to the colder regions .",
    "this possible reduction in heat transportation by the atmosphere may decrease the habitability of the planet because the polar ( and thus colder ) regions would probably stay cold ( williams , 1988a ) .",
    "however , even though there appears evidence for a more equable climate having existed during the cretaceous and eocene aeons ( e.g. barron , 1989 ) , which may have been caused by latitudinal ocean currents rather than the present - day longitudinal ones ( bice & marotzke , 2002 ) , it is not clear to what extent the size of the hadley cells depends on rotation rate or on land mass distribution , and how this increased equator to poleward heat flow could have been sustained ( barron , 1983 ) .",
    "nevertheless it is probable the area of habitability is smaller on a fast - rotating planet than it is on a slow - spinning one .",
    "secondly , we have the issue that pertains to the effect of tides on ocean mixing .",
    "it is well known that tidal forcing causes the mixing of stratified layers in the ocean ( e.g. egbert & ray , 2000 ) , though recent work shows that mixing by swimming sea creatures could be equally important ( katija & dabiri , 2009 ) .",
    "whatever its source this mixing has profound effects on the earth s climate because it allows for more efficient energy exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean , when cooler water reaches the surface from the deeper regions .",
    "the mixing also aids in the transport of water from warmer regions to colder ones by currents such as the gulfstream ( garrett , 2003 ) .",
    "last , the mixing brings up important nutrients from the depths of the ocean that micro - organisms residing closer to the surface can feed on .",
    "thus , it appears that in a simplistic sense ocean mixing could be an important ingredient in the sustenance of terrestrial - type life , and the habitability of the earth might be decreased without this effect .",
    "+ regarding the second set of conditions for the existence of terrestrial - type life , v ) , vi ) and vii ) are satisfied because of the presence of the moon , while conditions v ) and viii ) are the result of the planets all having small eccentricities and mutual inclinations , and the earth being far from a secular orbital resonance and from a ( secular ) spin - orbit resonance .",
    "thus at first glance it appears that the moon plays a key role in supporting life on earth .",
    "however , some of the above definitions should be interpreted with care .",
    "mars appears to fulfil several of these criteria ( moderate rotation speed , moderate obliquity , moderate orbital perturbations , moderate seasonal temperature variations ) . in addition , it could have a stable spin - axis if the secular frequencies where different .",
    "however , the slow rotation comes from the fact that it is a planetary embryo ( dauphas & pourmand , 2011 ) , and embryos appear to be less adapted for life because they lack the gravitational strength to keep a thick atmosphere and oceans against jeans escape , impact erosion or stellar wind pick - up over 4.5 gyrs .",
    "the mass of an embryo may be regulated by an ` isolation mass ' , which is one order smaller than an earth mass at 1  au .",
    "thus for the remainder of this paper we focus on a fully - formed planet with a satellite , such as the earth - moon system . but is the earth - moon system unique in its architecture or is the current system a common outcome ?",
    "we aim to answer that question and relate the findings to the habitability of the resulting systems .",
    "+ it is generally believed that the moon formed through the giant impact of a mars - sized body with the proto - earth ( e.g. hartmann & davis , 1975 ; cameron & ward , 1976 ; ida et al , 1997 ; kokubo et al . , 2000 ;",
    "canup , 2004 ) .",
    "this impact melted the impactor and part of the proto - earth , and resulted in much of the ejecta orbiting the earth ( benz et al . , 1991 ; cameron , 1997 ; canup , 2004 ) .",
    "the moon subsequently accreted from this disc of debris in less than a year",
    "( ida et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "usually the final disc mass was less than 2.5 lunar masses and orbited inside the earth s roche limit , currently at 2.9 earth radii @xmath22 .",
    "the moon ends up orbiting in the earth s equatorial plane .",
    "tidal evolution over the next 4.5  gyr pushed it towards its current orbit ( goldreich , 1966 ; touma & wisdom , 1994 ) . with the aid of numerical simulations elser et al .",
    "( 2011 ) conclude that binary planetary systems , such as the earth - moon system , occur approximately 8% of the time , ranging from 2.5% up to 25% .",
    "however , their studies did not take subsequent tidal evolution into account .",
    "+ goldreich ( 1966 ) and touma & wisdom ( 1994 ) have shown that the earth s current obliquity of 23.5@xmath4 requires its obliquity to have been approximately 10@xmath4 just after impact .",
    "similarly , earth s rotation period was approximately 5  h after the impact and the moon s inclination with respect to the earth s equator was about 10@xmath4 .",
    "the initial spin of the earth being nearly perpendicular to its orbital plane is a fairly rare outcome after a moon - forming impact : it has been shown that the obliquities of the terrestrial planets are isotropically distributed ( chambers , 2001 ; kokubo & ida , 2007 ) and their resulting rotation rates are approximately half of their maximum values ( kokubo & genda , 2010 ) .",
    "it is likely that the planetary rotation period is partially determined by the impact that formed the satellite ( lissauer , 2000 ) and the satellite mass is related to the impact parameter of the collision : grazing impacts produce heavier satellites and speed up the planet s rotation rate much more than head - on collisions ( kokubo et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "this result suggests there is a relation between the planet s rotation period and the satellite that has formed .",
    "however , as we show in appendix a , the relation is not one - on - one but rather a rough estimate .",
    "additionally , an isotropic obliquity distribution favours coplanar spins rather than perpendicular ones .",
    "what is then the evolution of the earth - moon system if the earth had been much more oblique just after the moon - forming impact ?",
    "+ atobe & ida ( 2007 ) studied the tidal evolution of systems consisting of an earth - like terrestrial planet with a satellite ranging from sub - lunar to super - lunar mass on a circular orbit .",
    "they varied the initial mass of the satellite ( @xmath23 ) and the initial obliquity of the planet ( @xmath7 ) but kept the initial semi - major axis of the satellite at 3.8  @xmath24 , the earth s rotation period at 5  h and the satellite s inclination with respect to the earth s orbit , @xmath25 , at 1@xmath4 .",
    "they showed that there are essentially three outcomes when these systems are evolved towards completion : i ) the satellite recedes from the planet and approaches ( and sometimes reaches ) the outer co - rotation radius ( case a ) , ii ) the satellite first recedes from and then approaches the planet resulting in collision ( case b ) , or iii ) the satellite first recedes from the planet and then approaches it but gets caught at the inner co - rotation radius ( case c ) . in general terms , case a occurs for low - mass satellites at low prograde or high retrograde obliquities .",
    "case b occurs for initial obliquities @xmath26 and case c occurs for heavy satellites ( @xmath27 , with @xmath2 being the planetary mass ) at low obliquity .",
    "we have summarised the results in fig .",
    "[ atobeida ] , taken from atobe & ida ( 2007 ) , where the symbol @xmath28 is @xmath7 in our notation .",
    "the outcome case a is further subdivided according to whether the system is still evolving .",
    "for case a1",
    "prograde planetary spins will have the planetary obliquity , @xmath29 evolve to @xmath30 while retrograde spins will evolve to @xmath31 .",
    "in the outcome a2 the system has stopped evolving .",
    "outcome a3 is a particular case of a1 , where a retrograde - spinning planet will eventually spin prograde due to the dominance of solar tides over satellite tides ( for a1 this does not happen ) .",
    "+ from this figure it appears that the outcome for oblique planets can be very different from the current earth - moon system .",
    "atobe & ida ( 2007 ) studied the evolution of these systems until their ultimate state . for light satellites , such as the moon ,",
    "the time scale to reach the final configuration is much longer than the age of the solar system , exceeding the hubble time for masses below half a lunar mass .",
    "thus their results can not be used to directly determine the state of the system at the current epoch i.e. 4.5  gyr after its formation .",
    "+    in this paper we determine the state of fictitious systems consisting of an earth - like terrestrial exoplanet and a satellite whose mass ranges from sub - lunar to super - lunar values .",
    "we investigate the tidal evolution of these systems starting with different initial planetary obliquities and satellite masses .",
    "we do this by performing a series of simulations similar to those done by atobe & ida ( 2007 ) but we cease them after the system has reached an age of 4.5  gyr .",
    "we then analyse the states of each system and determine which regions of the phase space are the most suitable for supporting terrestrial - type life .",
    "in addition we attempt to determine how likely it is to produce a system similar to our own from a range of initial conditions .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "+ in the next section we lay out the equations of motion consisting of the star , planet and satellite .",
    "these are based on the work of bou & laskar ( 2006 ) and correia ( 2009 ) . in section 3",
    "we describe our numerical methods and compare the evolution from our simulations to earlier results presented in bou & laskar ( 2006 ) for the conservative motion , and touma & wisdom ( 1994 ) for the tidal evolution . in section 4",
    "we present the results of our numerical simulations , focusing on the final states of the system and how these may change with slightly different initial conditions and passages through secular spin - orbit resonances . in the last section we present a summary and conclusions .",
    "we study the evolution of a hierarchical system consisting of a central star with mass @xmath32 , a terrestrial planet with mass @xmath2 and a satellite with mass @xmath23 .",

    "the planet and satellite rotate about the axis with maximal inertia , @xmath35 . from now on ,",
    "we shall use the dimensionless variant @xmath37 .",
    "we follow bou & laskar ( 2006 ) and correia ( 2009 ) in the derivation below .",
    "+ the conservative motion of the system can be tracked through the conservation of the total angular momentum    @xmath38    where a dot denotes a time derivative , @xmath39 are the spin angular momenta of the planet and satellite and @xmath40 are their orbital angular momenta .",
    "here @xmath41 is the spin frequency of either body , @xmath42 are the semi - major axes , @xmath43 are their eccentricities and @xmath44 are their mean motion .",

    "what follows the subscript @xmath25 can refer to either the planet or the satellite .",
    "tidal evolution acts on time scales much longer than the orbital period of both the planet and the satellite , so equation ( [ angmomcons ] ) is averaged over the mean anomalies of both bodies and the periapse of the planet - satellite pair .",
    "the resulting equations for the conservative motion are then given by ( bou & laskar , 2006 )    @xmath47    the equations above assume that the eccentricity of the satellite is constant during one full rotation of the line of apses .",
    "this does not necessarily have to be true , but we shall assume that it is so in this simplified model .",
    "a study that also accounts for the eccentricity evolution of the satellite is left for the future .",
    "+ in equations ( [ cons ] ) above we have introduced the angles @xmath48 , which is the inclination of the orbit of the satellite with respect to the planet s orbital plane , @xmath49 are the obliquities of both bodies with respect to the planet s orbital plane and @xmath50 are the obliquities of both bodies with respect to the satellite s orbital plane .",
    "in this study we are primarily interested in the quantities @xmath51 , @xmath29 and partially @xmath52 .",
    "we also introduced the precession constants    @xmath53    roughly , the quantities @xmath54 are the precession rates of the figures of the planet and satellite caused by the torques from the sun , the quantities @xmath55 are the precession rates of the poles of both bodies caused by mutual torques between them , and @xmath56 is the precession rate of the nodes of the satellite s orbit on the planet s orbit .",
    "+ on long time scales the system is subject to tidal forces , most notably between the planet and the satellite . in this study",
    "we adopt the constant time delay model of mignard ( 1979 , 1980 ) for its simplicity , keeping the eccentricity of the planet and satellite constant ( but not necessarily zero ) .",
    "the tidal forces from the planet and the satellite on each other act to reduce their rotation rates .",

    "in order to determine the evolution of the planet - satellite system with various initial conditions , we integrated the equations of motion with the aid of computer codes .",

    "the first only integrates the conservative motion without any tidal evolution .",
    "a second version only includes planet - satellite tides while the third version also includes the solar tides .",

    "these endstates should quantitatively reflect the possible configurations of the planet - satellite system for different values of the initial satellite mass and initial planetary obliquity . while the outcome is similar to atobe & ida ( 2007 ) , our approach is different because we terminate the simulations at a given time rather than determine the final state of the system after all tidal evolution .",
    "we also checked whether the planet s precession frequency will pass through a secular spin - orbit resonance with one or more of the inclination eigenfrequencies of the solar system , @xmath117 ( brouwer & van woerkom , 1950 ) .",

    "extreme seasonal variations in insolation and temperature may occur ( e.g. williams & kasting , 1997 ) and these could be a concern for terrestrial - type life .",
    "the widest satellite orbits are obtained for low - obliquity planets and masses between 0.005@xmath2 and 0.0125@xmath2 , and for planets with initial obliquity close to 180@xmath4 .",
    "smaller satellites do not raise a high enough bulge on the planet and thus need more time to expand .",
    "it should be noted that in all figures , the structure is symmetrical around @xmath120 .",
    "the size of the satellite orbit affects the strength of the tidal bulge on the planet and its pole precession frequency .",
    "the latter , especially , could be important for habitability when this frequency is close to one of the eigenfrequencies of the solar system .",

    "atobe & ida ( 2007 ) call this evolution type c. the final period ratio depends steeply on @xmath23 and scales as @xmath121 ( atobe & ida , 2007 ) and thus the transition from an evolving system to a double synchronous one with increasing @xmath23 is rather abrupt . applying this to our own system",
    "suggests that the habitability of the earth would be completely different if the moon were just 50% more massive .",
    "the double synchronous state also explains the decreasing final satellite semi - major axis with increasing satellite mass : the system reaches the double synchronous state and the final orbit is closer to the planet because of the lower initial ratio of angular momentum in the planet s rotation vs. that in the satellite s orbit .",

    "[ prot4 g ] .",
    "here we plot @xmath122 as a function of satellite mass and initial planet obliquity .",

    "[ sync4 g ] above , there is a very steep increase of the rotation period as a function of satellite mass , and the period reaches a maximum for a mass of approximately 0.02@xmath2 . here",
    "the rotation period of the planet is several weeks and the satellite semi - major axis sits between 40 and 45  @xmath123 .",
    "as the satellite mass increases , the final rotation period of the planet is reduced because of the larger fraction of initial angular momentum residing in the satellite orbit compared to the planet s rotation .",
    "even so , in the double synchronous state the rotation period of the planet is always longer than 96  hours , apart from very close to the edge of the central wedge .",
    "+ as we discussed earlier , these long rotation periods affect the climate on the planet and have implications for the origin and sustenance of life . in the double synchronous case the rotation period of the planet could be a substantial fraction of the relaxation time scale and large diurnal temperature variations could occur .",
    "furthermore , in the double synchronous state there are no tides and thus ocean mixing could stop , thereby reducing possible heat transport to the poles .",
    "however , the slow rotation rate may increase the hadley cell to reach the poles , which increases the heat flow to and the temperature at the polar regions .",
    "more studies are needed to decide which of these two effects dominates over the other .",
    "lastly , the long rotation period reduces the @xmath75 moment and causes the precession period of the planet to increase .",
    "this issue is discussed below .",
    "+ systems with very light satellites ( say @xmath124  @xmath2 ) may negatively affect the habitability because the lack of a tidal bulge raised by the satellite causes the planet to still rotate rapidly , which reduces ocean mixing .",
    "this would decrease the heat flow towards the poles , likely causing sustained low temperatures there that reduce habitability . + even though many systems are in the double synchronous state after 4.5  gyr , the real test to measure if the system has fully evolved is to determine the final obliquity of the planet . from atobe & ida ( 2007 )",
    "we know that when the double synchronous state is reached , the planet s obliquity slowly decreases back to 0 if prograde , or increases to 180@xmath4 if retrograde .",
    "figure  [ obl4 g ] depicts the obliquity of the planet after 4.5  gyr of tidal evolution .",
    "all double synchronous systems are fully evolved and the planet s obliquity is at 0 or 180@xmath4 .",
    "the only cases where the obliquity has a different value is when the system is not synchronous or when the satellite has collided with the planet . for planets",
    "whose spin is perpendicular to their orbit , the habitable regions are substantially reduced from planets with moderate to high obliquities ( spiegel et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "+    one last quantity that determines the stability of the obliquity , and potentially the habitability , is the precession frequency of the spin pole of the planet .",
    "figure  [ prec4 g ] plots the logarithm of the precession frequency of the spin pole of the planet , in arcsec per year , as a function of satellite mass and initial obliquity . in order to have a rough idea of whether this system will experience a secular spin - orbit resonance , contours corresponding to resonances with the nodal eigenfrequencies @xmath125 and",

    "the precession of the planet is slowest when the rotation period is the longest , and some of these systems could have evolved through the @xmath127 and @xmath128 and @xmath129 secular spin orbit resonances .",

    "each of these will be discussed in turn .",
    "it is unlikely that extrasolar terrestrial planets will exist in isolation , and recent data confirms this hypothesis ( lissauer et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "the existence of multiple planets in a given system raises the possibility of the system crossing secular - spin orbit resonances .",
    "the chances of that happening depends on the secular architecture of the system .",
    "atobe et al . (",
    "2004 ) studied the effect of the obliquity evolution of terrestrial exoplanets that were perturbed by a giant planet .",
    "they concluded that the terrestrial planet s obliquity variations were too large to sustain life if the giant planet was closer than about 5 hill radii from the terrestrial planet .",
    "however , their study was necessarily limited to a few representative cases of planetary configurations because a general study is currently unfeasible .",
    "+ the only planetary system for which we know the secular eigenfrequencies with a decent precision is our own .",
    "ideally we would like to test how a planet - satellite system responds to a secular spin - orbit resonance crossing in a multitude of systems , preferably even in a generalised manner , but that is not possible at this stage .",
    "thus in what follows we shall focus on a fictitious planet - satellite system crossing a secular spin - orbit resonance in our own solar system as a proof of concept , and cautiously use it as a possible outcome for other systems .",
    "if the mutual inclinations of the planets in other systems is small , the outcome presented here should be quantitatively similar to what happens in other systems .",
    "+ figure  [ prec4 g ] showed that it is possible for the planet - satellite system to cross several secular spin - orbit resonances , mostly @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the effect of such a resonance crossing is to increase the planet s obliquity . during a secular spin - orbit resonance",
    "the obliquity oscillates around its resonant value , @xmath141 . while in resonance , the maximum libration amplitude of the obliquity",
    "is given by ( atobe et al .",
    ", 2004 )    @xmath142    where @xmath143 is the forced inclination on the planet s orbit corresponding to the frequency @xmath117 .",
    "if the oscillation range is small , then we can use the approximation @xmath144 .",
    "the increase in obliquity when crossing a resonance is then @xmath145 .",

    "+    in fig .",
    "[ rescross ] we portray the obliquity of the planet vs time as it goes through the resonance crossing @xmath127 .",
    "the precession and obliquity of the planet were integrated using the method described in brasser & walsh ( 2011 ) , and the precession constant was artificially enhanced so as to match the precession rate of the planet just before it crosses the resonance with @xmath125 . during the integration",
    "the precession constant was linearly decreased in order to mimic the regression of the satellite from the planet . in the top panel",
    "the regression was twice as fast as in the bottom panel .",

    "the obliquity oscillates chaotically with large amplitude . for a low - obliquity planet",
    "the crossing through the resonance with @xmath125 could have disastrous consequences if it has polar ice caps such as the earth because the increased insolation at high latitudes would partially melt these ice caps , raise sea levels and potentially wipe out a substantial portion of coastal life .",
    "thus we argue that for terrestrial - type life to develop and be sustained , passage through secular spin - orbit resonances should be avoided .",

    "however , a 50% increase in the lunar mass or initial obliquity of the earth would have resulted in the earth - moon system having passed through the @xmath152 resonance before 4.5  gyr .",
    "recent simulations of terrestrial planet formation with a realistic accretion scenario demonstrated that these planets have rotation periods of about twice their minimum value , with @xmath153 and a spread of about @xmath154 ( kokubo & genda , 2010 ) . in order to account for the different initial rotation period of the planet we performed a series of simulations where we set the planet s initial period equal to 3  h and 7  h. rather than show the full results we decided to only show the regions where the system is doubly synchronous .",
    "the results are plotted in figs  [ s43h ] and  [ s47h ] . in the case",
    "the initial rotation period is 3  h the minimum satellite mass for which the system is synchronous has now increased beyond 0.03  @xmath2 , while it is close to 0.0125  @xmath2 for the case where the initial rotation period was 7  h. another interesting feature is that the area in the plot where the satellite falls onto the planet also depends on the initial rotation period , and it grows as the initial period increases .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that the tidal evolution increases the obliquity of the planet as the satellite recedes from the planet . at high",
    "obliquity the satellite will eventually turn around and fall onto the planet , but this only happens if the inclination between the spin of the planet and the orbit of the satellite @xmath155 part of the time .",
    "the planet s obliquity increase is lower for fast - spinning planets , a smaller number of cases will experience retrograde motion and the satellite will not fall onto the planet .      the habitable zone around the sun is thought to reside between 0.7  au and 1.3  au ( williams & kasting , 1997 ) .",
    "the precession time of the planet s spin and the satellite s orbit scales with the planet s semi - major axis as @xmath156 .",
    "this strong dependence means that at the edges of the habitable zone the strength of the solar tides varies by up to a factor of 3 from the value at 1  au .",
    "thus the regression rate of the planet s spin and the satellite s nodes vary by the same amount , regressing twice as fast at 0.7  au compared to 1  au and twice as slow at 1.25  au compared to 1  au . since the final state of the system is dominated by the tidal interaction between the planet and the satellite rather than by the influence of the sun , we found that the final outcome is very similar to what was presented in the figures above .",
    "however , the different precession rates of the planet s spin and the satellite s nodes are noteworthy , in particular in the case where the planet is farther from the sun because the region inside the @xmath125 contour of fig .",
    "[ 4g125 ] is greatly enhanced . for planets very close to the sun ( @xmath157  au )",
    "the tidal forces from the sun may begin to dominate over those of the satellite for lunar mass satellites .",
    "however , at these close solar distances the hill sphere of the planet becomes comparable to the maximum semi - major axis of the satellite for planets with low obliquity and approximately lunar mass satellites , and other dynamical effects can not be ignored .",
    "thus the investigation of these cases require a proper n - body treatment .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current study .",

    "most of the results are the same as in the previous examples , apart from the precession frequency of the planet s spin pole .",
    "since @xmath158 , the precession frequency for an identical system at 1  au should be a factor @xmath159 lower .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ 4g125 ] above , where we show the precession frequency of the planet s spin after 4.5  gyr of evolution as a function of the satellite mass and initial obliquity .",

    "<S> we investigate the obliquity and spin period of earth - moon like systems after 4.5  gyr of tidal evolution with various satellite masses ( @xmath0  @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the planet mass ) and initial planetary obliquity ( @xmath3  175@xmath4 ) and discuss their relations to the habitability of the planet . </S>",
    "<S> the satellite initially orbits in the planet s equatorial plane at @xmath5 planetary radii and the planet s initial rotation period is 5  h. the other tidal parameters are modelled after the earth and moon and we keep the satellite on a circular orbit . we find three possible outcomes : either i ) the system is still evolving , such as our own , ii ) the system is in the double synchronous state , with the planet s obliquity at either 0@xmath4 or 180@xmath4 , or iii ) the satellite has collided with the planet . </S>",
    "<S> the case iii ) occurs for initial planetary spins in the range @xmath6  120@xmath4 . for other @xmath7 , the satellite survives . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between case i ) and ii ) is abrupt and occurs at slightly larger satellite mass ( @xmath8 ) than the lunar mass . for higher masses </S>",
    "<S> the system is in the double synchronous state and the final planetary spin periods ( @xmath9 ) are longer than 96  h. we also discuss the habitability of the planet in each case . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that cases ii ) and iii ) are less habitable than case i ) . using results from models of giant impacts and satellite accretion </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the systems that mimic our own i.e. , with rotation period @xmath10  h and current planetary obliquity @xmath11 or @xmath12 only represent 14% of the possible outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> this esimate may only be reliable to within factors of a few , depending on how the probability is evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> elser et al . ( </S>",
    "<S> 2011 ) conclude that the probability of a terrestrial planet having a heavy satellite is 13% . combining these results </S>",
    "<S> suggests that the probability of ending up with a system such as our own is of the order of 2% .    </S>",
