    "galaxy clusters are the largest bound structures in the universe .",
    "this oft - repeated phrase captures both their extremeness as well as their simplicity .",
    "clusters are virialized and nearly spherical , their baryons are mostly in the form of a hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , and their galaxies are nearly all early - types with old stellar populations .",
    "the icm is close to hydrostatic equilibrium with a temperature near the halo s virial temperature , and is enriched to around one - third solar independent of cluster mass .",
    "the only significant subdivision of clusters comes from examining their central gas properties , where they split into cool core ( or cooling flow ) and non - cool core clusters .",
    "their smaller counterparts , galaxy groups ( usually referring to systems with x - ray temperatures below 2  kev or so ) , share many of these characteristics .",
    "the simplest models regard groups as mini - clusters , i.e. bound spheres of hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium , whose properties should be self - similar with clusters  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but a closer inspection of group and cluster properties reveals many puzzles and complexities .",
    "for instance , gas in hydrostatic equilibrium near the centers of groups should be sufficiently dense to have cooling times significantly shorter than a hubble time  @xcite , and therefore gas should be cooling rapidly onto the central galaxy . yet",
    "x - ray observations show a distinct lack of gas at temperatures below roughly one - third of the system temperature , and little cold gas or star formation is seen in the center  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) .",
    "evidently , some source of energy or entropy is acting to prevent gas cooling in the core .",
    "recently , observations of x - ray bubbles in the icm apparently blown by agn - driven jets from the central galaxy offer a possible way to balance cooling  @xcite . cosmic rays  @xcite , conduction  @xcite , and gravitational heating  @xcite may also be viable mechanisms .",
    "another indication of non - gravitational energy injection into intracluster gas comes from scaling relations between cluster x - ray luminosity ( @xmath8 ) , x - ray luminosity - weighted temperature ( @xmath9 ) , and galaxy velocity dispersion ( @xmath10 ) . the self - similar model including only gravitational heating predicts @xmath11 , which is confirmed by hydrodynamic simulations that do not include gas cooling or processes associated with galaxy formation  @xcite .",
    "observations indicate @xmath12 for clusters  @xcite , and an even steeper relation in groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this has led to speculation that some feedback process has added a significant amount of non - gravitational energy into the icm , which would puff out the gas distribution and lower the x - ray luminosity .",
    "such energy injection was dubbed  pre - heating \" by @xcite .",
    "understanding the amount , epoch , and origin of pre - heating has been the subject of many investigations .",
    "an influential paper by @xcite claimed that systems above 12  kev showed rising entropy with temperature , while below that temperature all groups had a similar entropy of @xmath13  kev @xmath14 . here",
    "entropy is defined as the x - ray weighted temperature divided by the electron density at one - tenth the virial radius to the two - thirds power . while subsequent observations showed that this claimed entropy floor is instead merely a more - gradual - than - expected decline  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the question of what elevates the entropy of gas in smaller systems remains unanswered .",
    "entropy has now become the de facto quantity discussed when quantifying pre - heating .    a third , more oblique indication of non - gravitational energy input into the icm is the presence of metals .",
    "the amount of metals , roughly one - third solar in clusters regardless of size , is large when one considers that in the most massive clusters only a few percent of baryons have formed into stars .",
    "it is further remarkable that this enrichment level is similar in clusters of all masses despite significant trends with mass in the amount of stars formed  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . enriching the icm to these levels represents a non - trivial challenge , because stars in cluster galaxies can themselves only provide a metallicity of about one - sixth solar  @xcite .",
    "accounting for intracluster stars can alleviate this disrepancy  @xcite , but the metals still must be removed from galaxies yet be retained in the hot icm gas .",
    "one possibility is that gas stripped off of infalling galaxies can sufficiently enrich the icm  @xcite ; if so , the enrichment process would not be energetically important .",
    "however , it is clear that the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) is enriched at as early as @xmath15 by powerful outflows  @xcite , so perhaps such outflows could also be responsible for enriching intracluster and intragroup gas .",
    "if so , outflows might simultaneously provide some level of pre - heating .",
    "in short there are three current puzzles in understanding the physics of the icm :    * _ cooling flow problem : _ cooling rates of hundreds to thousands of solar masses per year are expected based on simple cluster models , yet the measured amount of cooling gas is at least an order of magnitude less . * _ entropy problem : _ entropy levels are progressively more elevated over self - similar predictions towards smaller systems . * _ metallicity problem : _ it is unclear how metals are removed from galaxies in such a way as to enrich intracluster and intragroup gas as observed .",
    "occam s razor leads one to attempt to solve these issues with a single physical mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , this is difficult .",
    "for instance , the solution to the cooling flow puzzle can not invoke significant star formation ( and hence metal production ) , because little recent star formation is seen in cluster galaxies .",
    "models of entropy injection from supernovae seem to suggest that it is insufficient to solve the entropy problem  @xcite .",
    "these days , it is fashionable to mostly neglect the metallicity problem , ascribing it to a change in stellar yields or perhaps even the initial mass function ( imf ) , and attempt to solve the cooling flow and entropy problems with a single energy source : heating from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "however , this has difficulties as well , because the entropy requirements are large  @xcite , though more recently analytic models that use agn in a self - regulated way have had some success  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the entropy and metallicity problems , leaving aside the cooling flow issue for now .",
    "previous theoretical studies of the entropy problem have generally assumed some amount of energy or entropy injection at an early epoch , and then attempted to constrain the amount and epoch of pre - heating by evolving systems ( either analytically or numerically ) to compare with present - day clusters  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "few attempts have been made to understand or model in detail possible sources of pre - heating .",
    "observationally , there have been attempts to connect pre - heating and metal enrichment , but with limited success .",
    "@xcite argued that galactic winds must be responsible for icm enrichment , but they could only add a negligible amount of energy .",
    "* hereafter psf03 ) found that neither isentropic pre - heating nor cooling models can reproduce the entropy structure of intragroup gas .",
    "hence the physics of pre - heating remains a mystery , and the constraints on its amount and epoch remain only loosely connected to physical process of galaxy formation .    here we take a different approach .",
    "we begin with a model for galactic outflows within hierarchical galaxy formation simulations that is constrained by non - icm related observations , such as high - redshift igm enrichment and the galaxy mass - metallicity relation .",
    "we then study how such outflows impact the enrichment and entropy level of intragroup gas at @xmath16 .",
    "we are limited to investigating galaxy groups and not clusters owing to our numerical capabilities , but this is actually desirable because groups fall in a particularly interesting regime for pre - heating and enrichment processes .",
    "the observed turn - down at @xmath5  kev in the @xmath4 scaling relations  @xcite indicates that pre - heating energy input is comparable to the system s gravitational energy at group scales .",
    "groups have a signficantly larger stellar fraction , yet their metallicity appears to be comparable to or even lower than clusters , indicating that metal transport processes are crucial .",
    "groups are more generally important because they contain the majority of galaxies in the universe , and simple dynamical arguments suggest that group environments are the most effective for morphologically transforming galaxies through mergers .",
    "hence there appears to be a lot of action at the group scale .",
    "observations of intragroup gas are rapidly improving , and this provides important constraints on models of pre - heating and enrichment .",
    "investigating such constraints is a central theme of this paper .",
    "we have recently identified a model for galactic outflows that is remarkably successful at reproducing a wide range of observations of cosmic chemical enrichment . in (",
    "* hereafter od06 ) we used cosmological simulations that incorporate enriched kinetic feedback to show that a certain class of outflow models are particularly successful at matching detailed properties of igm enrichment , as traced by absorbers in quasar spectra from @xmath17 . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the exact same model was concurrently and fairly uniquely successful at reproducing the observed mass - metallicity relation in galaxies .",
    "in @xcite we showed that such winds are able to reproduce the luminosity functions of early galaxies , significantly suppressing early star formation as needed to solve the overcooling problem .",
    "@xcite showed that such a model best reproduces the early cosmic luminosity density evolution .",
    "the success of a single outflow model in matching such a wide range of observations , albeit mostly at @xmath18 , is compelling , and merits investigation into its impact on intragroup and intracluster gas .",
    "the outflow model we have found to be most successful follows scalings predicted by a momentum - driven wind scenario  @xcite . in such a model ,",
    "the wind speed scales with the galaxy s circular velocity , while the mass loading factor , i.e. the amount of mass ejected in an outflow as compared to the star formation rate , scales inversely with it .",
    "this yields a constant momentum input per unit star formation .",
    "we have found that the generic property making this outflow model successful is that early galaxies drive out an amount of mass comparable to or exceeding that formed into stars , at speeds well above the escape velocity of their host halos .",
    "while this might seem suprising , it appears to be required for early igm enrichment  @xcite , global star formation suppression  @xcite , and establishing the gas and metal content of high-@xmath19 galaxies  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , this scaling of wind velocity with galaxy size is also observed in local starburst - driven outflows  @xcite , and at @xmath20 in star - forming galaxies  @xcite , providing a connection between rare present - day outflows and the ubiquitous ones at high-@xmath19  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one notable issue is that for sufficient mass to be ejected , the energetic requirements are large , comparable to the available supernova energy  @xcite . given expected radiative losses , it may be that another source of energy besides supernovae is required , such as photons from young stars in low - mass galaxies , or agn in high - mass galaxies .",
    "the successes of these momentum - driven wind scalings suggest that we now have a plausible model , albeit phenomenological , of how outflows move mass , metals , and energy on large scales within a hierarchical structure formation scenario .    in this paper",
    "we show that cosmological hydrodynamic simulations incorporating momentum - driven outflow scalings are able to simultaneously enrich intragroup media , reduce the stellar fraction to observed levels , and match the entropy levels of observed groups .",
    "we compare simulations with and without winds to assess the impact of outflow metal and energy injection .",
    "we find that radiative cooling is mainly responsible for breaking the self - similarity between groups and clusters , but that outflows provide an additional entropy boost that becomes important in the poorest groups ( @xmath21  kev ) .",
    "a key aspect of outflows is that they suppress star formation , because cooling - only models can match intragroup medium entropy levels only at the expense of excessive stellar content .",
    "our results suggest that pre - heating and enrichment in groups today arise from the same outflows that are required to distribute metals in the cosmos and regulate early star formation .    in  [ sec :",
    "sims ] we describe our gadget-2 simulations with our chemical evolution and outflow modeling . in ",
    "[ sec : enrichment ] we study the enrichment properties of intragroup gas in these models , including alpha element ratios and evolution from @xmath22 . in ",
    "[ sec : entropy ] we examine entropy levels and scaling relations in intragroup gas , and quantify energy injection from outflows . in ",
    "[ sec : profiles ] we compare radial profiles of physical properties to data , and study the impact of outflows on such profiles .",
    "we summarize in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we run cosmological hydrodynamic simulations using gadget-2  @xcite , a cosmological tree - particle mesh - smoothed particle hydrodynamics code including radiative cooling and star formation  @xcite .",
    "our version  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter od08 ) also includes metal - line cooling  @xcite , uses a ( spatially - uniform ) cosmic photoionizing background given by  @xcite .",
    "we include the effects of galactic outflows and the creation of heavy elements as described in od08 .",
    "this builds on our implementation detailed in @xcite , following @xcite , with three major improvements : ( 1 ) we track enrichment contributions from type  ii supernovae , type  ia supernovae , and mass and metal loss from agb stars ; ( 2 ) we individual follow carbon , oxygen , silicon , and iron enrichment ; ( 3 ) we use galaxy baryonic masses ( rather than the local gravitational potential ) to estimate the galaxy parameters from which outflow properties are derived , using an on - the - fly galaxy finder .",
    "the upshot of these improvements is a more accurate tracking of metal evolution in various phases down to @xmath16 , as well as a more realistic implementation of the dependence of outflow properties with galaxy size .",
    "our chemodynamical model is broadly similar to that used to study icm enrichment using gadget-2by @xcite , though some details differ .",
    "we employ @xcite models with a chabrier imf for computing stellar evolution .",
    "the differences in our new implementation versus the one in od06 are motivated primarily by a desire to treat the momentum - driven wind model more accurately . in our old model",
    ", we used the local gravitational potential as a proxy for galaxy velocity dispersion . at high-@xmath19 ,",
    "when the dominant star - forming galaxy is the central object and halos generally only contain a single large galaxy  ( i.e. the halo occupation distribution lies on the plateau portion ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is a reasonable assumption . at low-@xmath19 ,",
    "as halos grow , satellites become more numerous and house more of the total star formation , this becomes a poorer assumption .",
    "a galaxy driving an outflow does so locally , and does not necessarily know about the halo in which it resides .",
    "hence in od08 we moved to identifying individual galaxies and using their properties rather than the global halo properties to derive wind parameters .",
    "in od08 we presented a detailed comparison of the resulting global and igm enrichment properties between our implementations , and found that at high-@xmath19 they gave similar results , but at low-@xmath19 they differed .",
    "we believe our new implementation is more accurate particularly at @xmath16 , so we employ it here , and do not compare to our previous ( od06 ) implementation .",
    "a key aspect for studies of the icm is iron enrichment from type  ia supernovae , included in our new simulations .",
    "we employ a type  ia rate following @xcite , who parameterize observations by @xcite via a prompt component that tracks star formation plus a delayed component that tracks stellar mass .",
    "the formulae and metal yields are detailed in od08 .",
    "metals and energy from delayed type  ia sne ( coming from stars ) are added to the nearest three gas particles .",
    "as noted in od08 , the vast majority of iron in the universe is produced in type  ii supernovae , but for concentrated stellar systems like groups and clusters , type  ia s provide a large contribution to the gas - phase iron abundance  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as in @xcite , each particle that is eligible for star formation has its star formation rate computed based on a @xcite law , and an appropriate level of enrichment is added based on type  ii supernova yields ( see od08 ) .",
    "the star - forming particle has some probability to be kicked into an outflow or spawn a star particle .",
    "the ratio of those probabilities is given by the mass loading factor @xmath23 , which is an input parameter to the model .",
    "if a particle is selected to be in an outflow , it is kicked with a velocity @xmath24 in a direction given by @xmath25*v*@xmath26*a * ( velocity cross acceleration ) , resulting in a quasi - bipolar outflow .",
    "wind particles propagate purely gravitationally until they are outside the star - forming region ( typically few kpc ) , at which point they can again interact hydrodynamically with surrounding gas . the following formulae are used to relate the galaxy baryonic mass @xmath27 to the mass loading factor and wind speed for star - forming particles in that galaxy : @xmath28 where the first equation is taken from @xcite , originally based on @xcite . the value of @xmath29 is taken from observations of outflows by @xcite , who found that they lie between @xmath30 ; we choose a random number in that interval for every outflow event .",
    "we include a factor to account for increased photon production in lower - metallicity systems .",
    "this wind model is identical in form to the  vzw \" model of @xcite ; full details are available in od08 .",
    "ejected wind particles are hydrodynamically decoupled ( i.e. the hydro forces are turned off , but not gravity ) until they reach a density one - tenth of the critical density for star formation , or for a maximum period of @xmath31 , which is e.g. @xmath32  myr for @xmath33  km / s .",
    "this is intended to simulate the outflow blowing a hole through the interstellar medium , which can not be accurately represented given the smoothed nature of sph . @xcite",
    "have investigated the effects of turning on or off hydrodynamic decoupling , and found that it gives significantly different results for high - resolution simulations of disk galaxies . however , we have done similar tests at the cosmological resolution used here , and found little difference in the global enrichment properties ; this is perhaps not surprising since the spatial resolution here is @xmath34 , and the maximum distance an outflow particle can propagate during the decoupled phase is @xmath35 ( and typically it is much less ) .",
    "one advantage of decoupling , as pointed out by @xcite , is that it results in better resolution convergence .",
    "of course this may not be desireable if the result converges to a physically incorrect answer , but it at least allows a resolution - independent calibration of the outflow model .",
    "we consider two main runs in this paper .",
    "they are identical in every way ( including random phases in the initial conditions ) with the exception that one includes momentum - driven outflows as described above , while the other does not include outflows .",
    "note that in both cases , thermal energy feedback from supernovae is still accounted for in the multi - phase subgrid model of @xcite ; however , the explicitly coupled phases means that such feedback can not drive an outflow .",
    "this is the reason why an explicit outflow model is required  @xcite .",
    "each run has @xmath36 dark matter and @xmath36 gas particles in a randomly - generated volume of @xmath37 ( comoving ) , with a concordance cosmology  @xcite having @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is slightly higher than that favored from wmap-5 , moving more towards values derived from cluster abundances  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the difference is not important for the present work .",
    "initial conditions are generated using an @xcite power spectrum in the linear regime at @xmath45 by displacing particles off a grid according to the zeldovich approximation .",
    "particle masses are @xmath46 and @xmath47 for gas and dark matter , respectively , and the gravitational softening length is set to @xmath34 comoving .      to identify galaxy groups , we find large bound halos using a spherical overdensity ( so ) algorithm , as described in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm finds particles at local potential minima , then expands spherically around those particles until the mean overdensity enclosed corresponds to the virial overdensity for the assumed cosmology ( specifically , @xmath48 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the outskirts of these systems may not properly follow the ellipticity of real systems ( which is often ambiguous anyway ) , but since the outermost properties contribute little to global group properties particularly when weighted by x - ray emission , this difference is not likely to be important .    to identify galaxies , we use spline kernel interpolative",
    "denmax ( skid ; * ? ? ?",
    "groups of galaxies are taken to be so halos that contain @xmath49 resolved galaxies .",
    "our galaxy mass resolution limit is given by a stellar mass of @xmath50 ( i.e. 64 star particle masses ) , above which galaxy stellar properties have been shown to be converged  @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "this mass is @xmath51  @xcite , where @xmath52 is the characteristic mass in a schechter function fit to the present - day stellar mass function .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of individual gas particles is computed using the astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec ) models  @xcite , from the particle s mass , sph - weighted density , temperature , and metallicity .",
    "apec outputs x - ray spectra , from which the luminosity is computed by summing intensities from 0.510  kev , uniformly weighted ( i.e. no filter profile is assumed ) .",
    "restricting to 0.52  kev makes little difference for our systems .",
    "contributions to line and continuum emission from individually tracked elements ( iron , oxygen , silicon , and carbon , along with hydrogen and helium ) are computed separately and summed .",
    "other elements are tied to iron assuming solar abundance ratios  @xcite , though because line cooling is dominated by iron and oxygen in the intragroup gas temperature and density regime , this choice makes little difference .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath8 of a given group is the summed x - ray luminosities of all particles within the virial radius .",
    "the group temperature @xmath9 is computed as the x - ray luminosity - weighted temperature of gas particles , and all quoted metallicities are also x - ray emission - weighted .",
    "the emission weighting is done to mimic observations , which obtain temperatures and abundances by fitting apec or similar models to x - ray spectra , and hence are effectively measuring luminosity - weighted quantities .",
    "radial profiles are computed by performing similar summations in 25 equal thickness spherical shells about the so halo center .      in this paper we will not directly present any numerical resolution convergence tests .",
    "this is unfortunate , and is not our preferred mode of operation .",
    "however , several practical issues limit our ability to directly study convergence for the objects of interest , primarily because the groups we examine in this work are already at the extreme of what we can compute in a random - volume simulations .",
    "while we have smaller - volume simulations available , they do not produce any systems in the observed group - mass regime , so direct convergence tests on group properties are not possible . to be specific ,",
    "our @xmath53 run s largest group is 2  kev , which is already fairly small by x - ray group standards ; our @xmath54 run s largest is around 0.5  kev , which then does not allow us to check resolution effects for the observationally relevant @xmath55  kev regime .",
    "on the flip side , we can not run even larger volume simulations given our present computational capabilities , because worsening the mass resolution beyond our @xmath53 run is found to significantly compromise early galaxy formation , which is important because these large bound systems form much of their galaxy population early on .",
    "hence , we are stuck in the uncomfortable position of only having a single combination of mass resolution and volume that can examine the properties relevant for observed galaxy groups . for these reasons ,",
    "the results in this work must be considered preliminary , and our main goal is to present new physical interpretations for group scaling relations as plausible if not definitive .",
    "nevertheless , we do have some reason to believe that our results are robust .",
    "in od08 we present resolution convergence studies for cosmic mass , energy , and metal distribution , and the simulation resolution used here is reasonably well converged .",
    "we have also checked using a @xmath54 simulation with @xmath36 dark matter and gas particles that the group properties at temperatures below 0.5  kev are numerically converged .",
    "we hope to be able to run constrained simulations to form individual groups and clusters at higher resolution in the future , but for now we do not take that approach because we would like to compare large statistical samples to observations .",
    "however , such a constrained - realization study for clusters was done by @xcite also using gadget-2 , with mass resolution comparable to what we use here , and through direct tests they determined that their results are not very sensitive to numerical resolution , at least in the central regions of clusters that dominate the x - ray emission .",
    "hence we believe that our results here should be sufficiently robust to numerical effects , so that our conclusions should be generally correct .",
    "observations of cluster and group enrichment have been bolstered by the increased sensitivity provided by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm_. it is well known that clusters show an iron abundance of one - third to one - half solar ( outside the cool core ) , essentially independent of cluster size  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "measurements in the poor group regime ( @xmath56  kev ) , which have recently become available , show a larger scatter with a tendency towards slightly increased metallicity relative to rich clusters , although the poorest groups seem to reverse the trend and have lower abundances  @xcite .",
    "it is puzzling that despite a significant increase in the stellar baryon fraction from the rich clusters to groups  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no corresponding change is seen in the x - ray gas metallicity .",
    "this suggests that the intragroup / intracluster medium metal enrichment is not simply related to the stars formed within the halo potential , and that distribution mechanisms and sources of enrichment play a critical role in governing metallicities . hence the enrichment level of intragroup gas provides key constraints on such processes",

    "the green points show the results for our momentum - driven wind simulation , and the blue points show the no - wind run .",
    "the number of resolved galaxies in each group is indicated by the small number on the plot ( in this and subsequent figures ) .",
    "the key result is that the iron abundance hovers around the observed value between one - third and two - thirds solar for @xmath57  kev systems .",
    "the range of observations for clusters from 1.510  kev ( [ fe / h]@xmath58 ) from @xcite is shown as the dotted lines .",
    "individual iron abundances for galaxy groups from @xcite are shown as the red points ; observations by @xcite show a similar trend .",
    "there is a mild trend for lower - mass systems to have higher metallicities down to 0.5  kev , then a significant drop to smaller systems .",
    "qualitatively , this is in agreement with observations , though data on the poorest systems is still highly uncertain .",
    "matching the observed enrichment level of intragroup gas is a significant success for this outflow model , and indicates that our chemical enrichment model is working together with stellar mass growth to properly enrich x - ray emitting gas .",
    "@xcite achieved similar success for clusters , with a similarly sophisticated chemical enrichment model implemented in gadget-2 .",
    "hence a metallicity of one - third to one - half solar in intracluster and intragroup gas is achievable using standard yields and initial mass functions , when the cosmic production and distribution of metals is properly incorporated into hierarchical structure formation models .",
    "this suggests that non - standard metal yields or initial mass functions  ( imfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not required to match observed abundance levels . in fact , @xcite and @xcite found that standard yields and a salpeter imf provides a better fit to cluster abundances and its evolution than a highly top - heavy imf .",
    "perhaps more surprising is that no wind simulation also roughly reproduces the observed iron abundance .",
    "one might surmise that this is because the iron content in intragroup gas is dominated by delayed type  ia supernovae , thereby tracking the stellar mass distribution , and gaseous outflows play a subdominant role . to some extent that is true , but it turns out that the apparent insensitivity of iron enrichment to outflows is something of a coincidence .",
    "in reality , the no - wind simulation only matches the iron abundance because it overproduces the amount of stars in groups , thereby compensating for the lack of metal dissemination into intragroup gas .",
    "we will return to this point when we examine the baryon fractions in  [ sec : baryfrac ] .",
    "the evolution of the iron abundance has now been measured for massive clusters out to @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found an increase of roughly a factor of two from @xmath59 .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fig : metal ] shows the iron abundance in our momentum - driven case at @xmath16 ( green points ) and @xmath60 ( magenta ) .",
    "the dotted lines show the @xcite range at @xmath16 lowered by a factor of two , for a rough comparison to the @xmath60 predictions .",
    "our simulation predicts iron abundance growth that is roughly consistent with that seen in clusters , though the growth rate seems somewhat higher in the models than in the data .",
    "of course we are comparing simulated groups with observed rich clusters at @xmath60 , so the discrepancy may be due to differential metal evolution between groups than clusters .",
    "but the predicted metal increase is independent of system size , at least in the range we can probe with these simulations , so this explanation is disfavored .",
    "another possibility is that our central group galaxies have too much star formation at @xmath61 , since we do not include any feedback mechanism for truncation of star formation .",
    "these minor discrepancies aside , the predicted metallicity evolution is generally in agreement with observations .",
    "the outflow simulation predicts a significant drop in metallicity below 0.5  kev or so .",
    "this is likely a reflection of the mass - metallicity relation for galaxies setting in  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "poor groups of this size typically house @xmath62 galaxies ( such as our local group ) , and below @xmath63 the metallicity of a galaxy begins to drop with stellar mass  @xcite . since the mass - metallicity relation is governed by outflows",
    ", one would expect the no - wind simulation to show no such drop , and figure  [ fig : metal ] confirms this to be the case .",
    "hence although the star formation efficiency and stellar fractions are higher in smaller groups ( as we will see in  [ sec : baryfrac ] ) , outflows are able to compensate for this by driving more metals out of group potentials . @xcite and @xcite found that the poorest groups in their sample at @xmath21  kev have lower metallicities ( see data points at @xmath64  kev in figure  [ fig : metal ] ) , but the samples are small and the uncertainties large .",
    "our simulation also predicts an increase in the spread in metallicities at low-@xmath9 , owing to the stochastic nature of outflows ; this may help explain the large range of metallicities seen for the poorest groups .",
    "as observations improve in this regime , the abundances of the smallest x - ray groups should provide a critical test of outflow models .",
    "the oxygen to iron ratio is often employed as a diagnostic of the contribution from type  ii versus type  ia supernovae , since oxygen is produced primarily in the former while iron primarily in the latter ( at least in groups and clusters ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : metal ] shows [ o / fe ] for the momentum - driven wind simulation at @xmath16 ( green points ) and @xmath60 ( magenta ) .",
    "these metallicities are x - ray emission weighted , so they trace the enrichment level of hot gas only .",
    "since oxygen enrichment occurs predominantly at earlier epochs coincident with star formation , while type  ia supernovae enrich in iron over longer cosmic timescales , [ o / fe ] drops mildly with redshift .",
    "our wind simulations predicts a @xmath65% drop from @xmath22 , independent of system size .",
    "future observations of icm alpha element abundances in high-@xmath19 clusters can test this prediction .",
    "comparing [ o / fe ] between our wind ( green points ) and no - wind ( blue ) simulations , it is evident that the [ o / fe ] ratio provides a strong constraint on outflow properties . without outflows ,",
    "oxygen is not disseminated effectively into diffuse gas , and instead remain trapped in stars . in our no - wind run , this results in [ o / fe]@xmath66 at all group masses . observations of clusters from @xmath67  kev by @xcite indicate an oxygen to iron ratio of @xmath68% compared to solar , with no trend versus system size ; this range is indicated by the dotted lines in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : metal ] .",
    "our momentum - driven wind run places much more oxygen into x - ray emitting gas , and no trend with system size , in remarkably good agreement with observations .",
    "it is notable that a different wind model explored by @xcite , namely the  constant wind \" model of @xcite , was not able to achieve as high [ o / fe ] ratios as observed .",
    "hence , [ o / fe ] represents a sensitive test of outflows , which our momentum - driven wind simulation nicely passes .",
    "contrary to the usual assumption , we find that the [ o / fe ] ratio in x - ray emitting gas is not a good indicator of the relative numbers of type  ii and type  ia supernovae that have exploded within the group potential . rather , [ o / fe ] ( and presumably other alpha - to - iron ratios ) reflect more the distributions mechanisms of the various elements .",
    "this is seen by comparing the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : metal ] and figure  [ fig : baryfrac ] .",
    "the latter shows the global mass - weighted [ o / fe ] ratio in our simulated groups , including both stars and cold gas . in both the no - wind and momentum - driven wind simulations , the mass - weighted [ o / fe ]",
    "is around solar , roughly independent of group size .",
    "this is in stark contrast to typical values of 0.7  solar in the outflow run , and 0.1  solar in the no - wind case .",
    "this arises because oxygen is predominantly distributed into hot gas via winds from galaxies , while iron is predominantly distributed from old stars .",
    "when no winds are present , oxygen remains trapped within galaxies , eventually being locked into stars , while iron comes from older stars that can dynamically diffuse out of galaxies directly into hot gas . as a result , x - ray weighted [ o / fe ] is a sensitive tracer of metal distribution mechanisms , but is not effective as a stellar chronometer .    at face value ,",
    "our results further imply that tidal and ram pressure stripping of metals out of galaxies falling into deep potential wells is not sufficient to pollute intragroup gas as observed .",
    "such dynamical processes are in principle implicitly included in the no - wind run , yet the no - wind run fails to enrich intragroup gas sufficiently with oxygen .",
    "this result apparently contradicts the semi - analytic+n - body simulation results of @xcite , whose models predict that ram pressure stripping dominates hot gas enrichment for present - day clusters .",
    "this may indicate that the simplified modeling used in that work is not capturing the full hydrodynamics .",
    "alternatively , it may be that ram - pressure stripping is numerically suppressed in our simulations .",
    "for instance , @xcite demonstrated that gadget-2  tends to oversuppress stripping relative to amr codes , as sph has trouble modeling hydrodynamical instabilities .",
    "hence while our model of dynamical metal ejection is successful , further testing is required to determine whether gas stripping processes can also be effective .",

    "the top panel shows the fraction of baryons in stars ( we do not distinguish stars in galaxies from intracluster / intragroup stars ) .",
    "it is evident that galactic outflows are effective at suppressing star formation on group mass scales .",
    "observational estimates of the stellar fraction on group scales are challenging , primarily owing to the difficulty in constraining the dominant baryonic component in hot gas , but data from @xcite , which carefully accounts for intracluster stars , are broadly reproduced in the momementum - driven wind run .",
    "as seen in the second panel , there is virtually no cold gas ( @xmath70k ) at least in the range of observed x - ray groups , so baryons not in stars are essentially all in an x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the @xcite stellar fraction data are consistent with data from @xcite for @xmath71 when corrected for icl light contributions  @xcite .",
    "below this mass , systematic uncertainties become large .",
    "the most massive groups still have 20% of their baryons in stars , which is too high compared to data , and a simple extrapolation of the simulated group trends to higher masses would clearly violate observations of stellar fractions in rich clusters ( typically @xmath72 ) . another way to say",
    "this is that the observed @xmath73 relation ( where @xmath74 is the stellar fraction ) is steeper than our simulations predict .",
    "specifically , our simulations yield @xmath75 around @xmath76 , which is shallower than both @xcite and @xcite data , though somewhat steeper than the semi - analytic model predictions of @xcite  ( as calculated by * ? ? ?",
    "however , this does not necessarily indicate a significant constraint on cold dark matter models  ( as argued by * ? ? ?",
    "rather , it probably owes to a lack of suppression of star formation in massive systems in simulations , from agn feedback or whatever the heating source is that prevents cooling flows .",
    "the suppression of star formation on group scales is not as great as the global suppression : the simulation without winds at @xmath16 contains 17% of its total baryons in stars , while the wind run has 7% .",
    "the latter value is in good agreement with observational estimates  @xcite .",
    "hence outflows are able to suppress star formation both globally and on group scales in general agreement with observations .",
    "the third panel of figure  [ fig : baryfrac ] shows the mass fraction of total baryons against halo mass .",
    "in general , the total baryon fraction is slightly smaller than the cosmic baryon fraction ( indicated as the dotted line ) , owing to increased pressure support that puffs out the hot gas ; this is qualitatively consistent with observations  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "outflows are further able to remove a small but noticeable amount of baryons from halos with masses @xmath77 .",
    "returning to the iron abundance with and without outflows , it is now clear that although simulations without outflows reproduce the observed intragroup metallicities , they do so by forming too many stellar baryons .",
    "outflows therefore serve the dual purpose of suppressing star formation , while transferring sufficient metals from galaxies into the hot gas phase .",
    "furthermore , outflows significantly increase the alpha element ratio in intragroup gas to be in better agreement with observations .",
    "hence our simulations suggest that outflows are likely to be necessary in order to enrich intragroup gas to observed levels .",
    "we now turn to studying another aspect of outflows , namely the energy they add to intragroup gas .",
    "entropy levels in intragroup gas are known to be elevated relative to self - similar extrapolations from clusters , but the physical process responsible for pre - heating is unclear .",
    "@xcite argued analytically that supernova heating together with radiative cooling could yield the observed entropy distribution in groups .",
    "incorporating such feedback processes into simulations has only recently been attempted ; for instance , @xcite examined and dismissed a simple model of galactic outflows as the dominant source of pre - heating .",
    "@xcite showed that an ad hoc model of energy input proportional to star formation is able to reproduce observed entropy levels , but preliminary comparisons to entropy evolution favored an early pre - heating scenario .",
    "none of these works employed an outflow model that is constrained to match external observations . here",
    "we examine whether our momentum - driven wind model , in addition to enriching intragroup gas , is concurrently able to add significantly to its entropy budget .",

    "entropy is defined here as @xmath80 , where @xmath9 is the system x - ray luminosity - weighted temperature and @xmath81 is the electron density at a given radius .",
    "data points ( binned ) from psf03 are shown , and the expected self - similar scaling normalized to the most massive clusters is indicated by the magenta line . in self - similar scaling , @xmath82 is independent of size since groups are scaled - down versions of clusters , hence @xmath83 .",
    "as is well - known , @xmath78 is elevated at group scales relative to a self - similar extrapolation from massive systems .",
    "while an entropy floor at @xmath13  kev  @xmath14  @xcite is not seen in the models , more recent observations indicate no floor but merely a more gradual decline than expected .",
    "psf03 finds a best fit of approximately @xmath84 .",
    "elevated entropies are obtained in both wind and no - wind runs , since radiative cooling is effective at preferentially removing low - entropy intragroup gas over a hubble time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the low - entropy gas then ends up forming stars . while the entropy trend produced by radiative cooling qualitatively agrees with data , as shown in @xcite ,",
    "there are two major difficulties with the radiative cooling solution alone .",
    "the first is that the amount of stars produced by the low - entropy gas exceeds observations , as shown in figure  [ fig : baryfrac ] and found previously  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the second is that , as seen in figure  [ fig : stemp ] , the entropy increase from radiative cooling alone is not quite sufficient to match observations .",
    "hence an alternate source of entropy is still required , preferably one that simultaneously reduces the amount of star formation in groups .",
    "our momentum - driven outflow model appears to alleviate both problems .",
    "we have seen that it reduces the stellar baryon fraction to be in better agreement with observations on group scales .",
    "figure  [ fig : stemp ] also shows that it raises the entropy level over the no - wind case , particularly for systems with @xmath21  kev , to be in slighly better agreement with the low-@xmath9 end of available observations .",
    "an extrapolation of the observed trend ( @xmath85 ) to lower @xmath9 is also well - matched to the outflow run predictions , which can be fit by @xmath86 over the temperature range probed .",
    "hence outflows together with radiative cooling appear to provide a viable solution to the entropy crisis in galaxy groups .",
    "the fact that outflows _ increase _ core entropy is not trivial ,",
    "since they also suppress cooling , and hence suppress the removal of low - entropy gas .",
    "the entropy addition from outflows therefore appears to be ( more than ) compensating for the reduced stellar fraction .",
    "that said , our most massive systems show twice the stellar fraction as observed ( see figure  [ fig : baryfrac ] ) , and so some additional mechanism such as agn feedback is likely required to further suppress star formation at @xmath87  kev .",
    "it is not clear whether such a mechanism would continue to compensate for further reductions in stellar fractions in the way that outflows do .",
    "looking carefully at figure  [ fig : stemp ] , it does appear that the core entropy is still slightly low for @xmath87  kev systems , though it is within uncertainties .",
    "hence it could be that radiative cooling , outflows , and some other feedback mechanism all work together to establish the entropy level in larger groups and clusters . a fully self - consistent model incorporating all these processes is required to assess this .    the entropy in group outskirts is also seen to be elevated with respect to a self - similar extrapolation from clusters .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : stemp ] shows the entropy at @xmath69 , roughly two - thirds the virial radius .",
    "observations ( psf03 , shown as the red points ) are more uncertain here , particularly for groups , but our simulations generally fall in the observed range .",
    "@xmath88 is mostly insensitive to outflows ; it is apparently established by radiative cooling .",
    "if anything , the wind run shows marginally lower entropies , probably owing to reduced removal of low - entropy baryons .",
    "the @xmath89 relation shows a slope just below unity , unlike @xmath78 and more in line with expectations from self - similarity . if this would continue to the largest clusters",
    ", it would exceed the observed @xmath88 ; this will require constrained realization simulations of large clusters to test .",
    "we now quantify pre - heating due to outflow energy injection in simulations . during our runs",
    "we record the mass and velocity ( and hence energy ) of particles kicked into an outflow .",
    "ideally , one would like to track where and when this energy gets deposited into surrounding gas ; unfortunately , this is not straightforward .",
    "so instead , we make a crude estimate of energy input into intragroup gas by assuming that all the outflow particles lying within a group s hot gas by @xmath16 have deposited their entire outflow energy into that gas .",
    "note that this estimate may either be an underestimate of the actual energy added if outflow particles lose energy to intragroup gas but end up outside the group , or it may be an overestimate if groups accrete outflow particles that already have deposited most of their energy outside the group s halo . while this estimate is not exact , it is still instructive .",
    "-0.5 in    -0.5 in    figure  [ fig : ewind ] shows the wind energy per hot baryon deposited as a function of @xmath9 ( top panel ) , and the median age when the energy was deposited ( bottom panel ) , as the green points .",
    "the energy is the total outflow energy of all wind particles residing within the hot intragroup gas , divided by the number of baryons in that gas ( note that this is not all the baryons in the group ) .",
    "the age is estimated by taking the median of the ejection times of all wind particles within intragroup gas ; again , this must be considered a relatively crude estimate of the energy injection time .",
    "the energy deposition per baryon shows a mild decreasing trend with system size .",
    "this is at first glance surprising , since in the momentum - driven outflow model the wind energy output per unit star formation scales as @xmath90 ( equation  [ eqn : vwind ] ) .",
    "hence one expects larger systems to have larger energy input .",
    "but the baryonic budget serves to counter this trend : larger groups have a lower stellar fraction and more hot gas over which to spread the energy ( figure  [ fig : baryfrac ] ) .",
    "the net result is that hot baryons in larger systems are heated slightly less by winds .",
    "the total energy injection into groups from outflows is comparable to the total supernova energy from stars formed in the group ( magenta points in figure  [ fig : ewind ] ) .",
    "the sn energy is computed by taking the total stellar mass in each group and multiplying by @xmath91  ergs@xmath92 for a standard imf  ( od08 ) . as argued in od08 ,",
    "such high levels of energy input appear to be necessary to provide the cosmic distribution of metals from galactic outflows , and owing to expected radiative losses this level of energy may not be obtainable from supernovae alone ( barring imf variations ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while we can not claim to fully understand or model the outflow driving mechanism , we note that such energetic outflows seem to be required to match a wide range of observations , not just intragroup gas entropy .",
    "the median energy injection time ( green points in bottom panel of figure  [ fig : ewind ] ) is typically fairly recent , with the smallest systems having a median pre - heating age of 5  gyr ( @xmath93 ) , while our largest systems at around 2  kev have a typical pre - heating age of 8  gyr ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this can be compared to the median age of star particles in the group ( magenta points ) , which are comparable although slightly older , particularly in the smaller systems . in general",
    "it appears that stars in group galaxies are responsible for enriching and pre - heating intragroup gas , as expected . in the future we plan to examine the redshift evolution of hot gas to determine more precisely where and when outflow energy and metals are deposited .",
    "figure  [ fig : ewind ] shows that the energy deposition from winds typically exceeds the system s thermal energy for systems below about 0.5  kev ( note the solid line showing equality between @xmath9 and wind energy input ) .",
    "hence outflows should produce a lowered luminosity for systems near this temperature and below .",
    "here we investigate whether this provides an explanation for the apparent break in luminosity scaling relations near @xmath95  kev , below which the @xmath4 relation is observed to be significantly steeper  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". the large scatter may be due partly to observational systematic uncertainties , but this seems unlikely to provide the bulk of the explanation , since clusters show similar scatter that can be directly linked to their well - measured density and temperature profiles  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has been suggested that it may instead reflect intrinsic scatter in the level of pre - heating  @xcite .",
    "since our simulations implicitly produce variations in halo concentration and formation epoch , as well as in wind energy deposition , these alone can not provide the observed scatter  ( as also argued by * ? ? ?",
    "we leave for the future a careful consideration of observational causes of scatter via making mock x - ray images and analyzing them alongside real x - ray data",
    ". this will also be useful for evaluating the more general bias that observed groups tend to be x - ray bright , but these may not be representative of groups as a whole .",
    "the final solution , however , may require some intermittent additional source of heating such as agn feedback .    in summary , outflows add an important contribution to the entropy budget of poor groups , whose energy input becomes comparable to the system thermal energy at @xmath103  kev .",
    "radiative cooling is primarily responsible for breaking self - similarity above this scale , while outflows exaggerate deviations from self - similarity below this scale .",

    "the inner limit corresponds to @xmath105 , which is typically few tens of kpc , and approaches the effective resolution limit of our simulations .",
    "as seen in the top panel , the luminosity profile shows a flat central core  ( similar to observed non - cool core systems ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the poorly resolved central region does not make a significant contribution to groups x - ray emission - weighted properties .",
    "we subdivide the groups into two equal - number bins exceeding 0.5  kev , which results in about 40 groups each from @xmath106  kev and @xmath107  kev .",

    "outflows have essentially no impact here , as the elevation of @xmath88 owes purely to the removal of low - entropy gas via radiative cooling .",
    "* the amount of energy per baryon added to hot intragroup gas drops with increasing system size , and exceeds the thermal energy below 0.5  kev . as a result , the @xmath4 relation shows a clear break below 1  kev .",
    "both the @xmath4 and @xmath96 relations predicted from our momentum - driven wind run are in good agreement with observations .",
    "* profiles of @xmath9 and [ fe / h ] are qualitatively similar to observed , though model profiles appear to be somewhat steeper than data .",
    "the alpha enhancement profile is also quite shallow .",
    "possible causes include missing heat transport mechanisms and an excess of late - time star formation in the central galaxy .",
    "* outflow energy injection makes the density and entropy profiles shallower at @xmath21  kev , particularly in the inner regions .",
    "the simultaneous success of enrichment and entropy injection from our momentum - driven wind outflows is a significant achievement , especially considering that this outflow model was not tuned in any way to match observations of intragroup gas . while the iron abundance is not very sensitive to outflows , the oxygen to iron ratio provides a key diagnostic that is well reproduced by our outflow model .",
    "most of the entropy increase actually owes to radiative cooling , but outflows serve both to enrich intragroup gas as well as lower the stellar content to bring it more into line with observations .",
    "the implication of our models is that pre - heating in intragroup gas arises from radiative cooling together with the same galactic outflows required to , for instance , enrich the igm at high redshifts or establish the mass - metallicity relationship of galaxies .",
    "hence the source of pre - heating may not be a mysterious widespread energy injection at high redshifts , nor be related to agn feedback at lower redshifts . while something like agn feedback is still required to truncate star formation in the central galaxy , our results suggest that it need not be a significant contributor to the overall entropy budget of intragroup gas .",
    "this eases the tension between a feedback process that must operate on dense central gas to prevent cooling flows ( and therefore requires large amounts of energy to significantly increase entropy , since @xmath124 ) , and the need to raise the entropy of the more diffuse intragroup medium",
    ".    nevertheless , there are certainly still significant problems with our simulations as - is , most notably the excess of late - time star formation in the central galaxy that may be responsible for poor fits to observed x - ray profiles .",
    "there is also the issue of the observed scatter in the x - ray scaling relations , which points to some more stochastic form of energy injection .",
    "finally , it appears that large galaxy clusters also have elevated entropies all the way out to their outer regions  @xcite .",
    "since wind energy can not be responsible because it is less important in higher mass systems , this suggests that agn energy , perhaps transported via bouyant bubbles , are needed to explain the thermodynamics of clusters .",
    "a complete understanding of hot diffuse gas in groups and clusters will only come when a model addresses all three icm issues simultaneously , namely the cooling flow , entropy , and metallicity problems .",
    "our current simulations explicitly do not do so , focusing on two of the three problems solely in the poor group regime .",
    "hence although our simulations suggest that entropy injection is tied mostly to metal enrichment and not cooling flow prevention , we forward this interpretation only a suggestion and not a definitive statement .",
    "this must still be tested using simulations that self - consistently incorporate some mechanism to quench star formation in massive galaxies in accord with cluster galaxy data .",
    "we are actively pursuing such investigations .",
    "there are two immediate paths for future investigations .",
    "the first is to incorporate some physical or heuristic model of star formation truncation in massive galaxies , in order to understand its impact on energy and metal input into intragroup gas .",
    "the second is to study how the enrichment and entropy of intragroup gas grow with redshift within a hierarchical framework , in order to better understand its physical origin .",
    "we also plan to continue developing tools to provide closer comparisons with observations , such as the ability to produce simulated x - ray maps that can be analyzed alongside data .",
    "finally , we are planning to run significantly larger simulations with up to @xmath125 particles in the near future , which will allow us to have greater dynamic range , study larger clusters , and properly assess resolution effects . while our initial efforts towards understanding intragroup gas chemo- and thermodynamics from outflows seem promising , there is much work to be done to fully understand the interplay between galaxy formation processes and the x - ray emitting plasma in the largest bound structures in the universe .",
    "the simulations used here were run at the national center for supercomputing applications , as well as the university of arizona s campus supercomputers .",
    "we thank mark dickinson , mark fardal , neal katz , dusan keres , trevor ponman , david weinberg , and the referee for helpful suggestions .",
