    "the accelerator complex at jlich consists of an isochronous cyclotron as injector and a strong focusing synchrotron .",
    "injection is performed by stripping of negative ions ( hydrogen and deuterium ) at an energy of 40 mev*a .",
    "they can be vector polarised ( protons and deuterons ) and tensor polarised ( deuterons ) .",
    "the synchrotron cosy is equipped with electron cooling at injection energy and stochastic cooling at higher energies .",
    "it provides beams up to @xmath0 mev / c momentum .",
    "cosy can be used as a storage ring to supply internal experiments with beam .",
    "the beam can also be stochastically extracted within time bins ranging from 10 s to several minutes to external experiments .",
    "the emittance of the extracted cooled beam is only @xmath1 mm mrad .",
    "this allows excellent close to target tracking .",
    "hence a large fraction of the experimental program is devoted to meson production close to threshold .    in fig .",
    "[ energy_comp ] is the maximal energy of cosy compared to other hadron accelerators",
    ". some mesons , which can be produced in a @xmath2-collision in the cosy range , are shown together with some selected nucleon resonances . also shown",
    "is the equivalent photon energy to produce the same final systems and maximal energies of photon facilities are given .    here",
    "we will concentrate on hadron physics thus leaving out detectors built for different purposes like pisa , nessi and jessica ( see fig .",
    "[ energy_comp ] ) .",
    "the detectors of interest are cosy-11 , anke and edda internally and tof and big karl externally .",
    "the physics at edda , proton - proton scattering of unpolarised on unpolarised , polarised on unpolarised and polarised on polarised @xcite is terminated and is therefore neglected here .",
    "cosy-11 and anke are magnetic detectors .",
    "the former @xcite employs an accelerator dipole magnet while the latter @xcite is a chicane consisting of three dipoles with the middle one as analysing magnet .",
    "tof @xcite is a a huge vacuum vessel with several layers if scintillators .",
    "time of flight is measured between start detectors in the target area and the scintillators .",
    "the target area detectors are especially suited for the identification of delayed decays and tof is thus a geometry detector .",
    "big karl @xcite is a focusing magnetic spectrograph of the 3q2d - type .",
    "particle tracks are measured in the focal plane area with packs od mwdc s followed by scintillator hodoscopes allowing for a time of flight path of 3.5 m. additional detectors exist .",
    "momo @xcite measures the emission vertex of charged particles .",
    "the germanium wall @xcite is a stack of four annular germanium diodes being position sensitive .",
    "it acts as a recoil spectrometer .",
    "one strong item in cosy physics is the study of strangeness production in various processes in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions .",
    "here we have to concentrate on a few of these reactions .",
    "the @xmath5 reactions , associated strangeness production were measured by cosy-11 @xcite and tof @xcite . fig .",
    "[ associated ] shows the ratio @xmath6 as function of the excess energy .",
    "the ratio rises strongly to threshold .",
    "this unexpected behaviour is studied within several models , including pion and kaon exchange added coherently with destructive interference @xcite or incoherently  @xcite , the excitation of nucleon resonances  @xcite ( labeled effective lagrangian ) , resonances with heavy meson exchange ( @xmath7 ) @xcite and heavy meson exchange ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding curves are also shown in the figure .",
    "all models show a decrease of the ratio with increasing excitation energy but none of them accounts for all data .",
    "the associated strangeness production is also a useful tool to study the nucleon - hyperon interaction via fsi . at present a high resolution study of this interaction runs at big karl ( see contribution by roy et al . ) .",
    "the measurement of dalitz diagrams enables even the investigation of the importance of intermediate @xmath11 excitation .",
    "connected with the associated strangeness production is the question whether pentaquarks exist .",
    "most of the experimental searches were performed with electromagnetic probes on the neutron , which , of course , is embedded in a nucleus .",
    "a cleaner environment is the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "the reaction studied with tof is the @xmath12 reaction .",
    "the @xmath13 is identified via its decay into two pions and the @xmath14 via its delayed decay .",
    "the data from ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ pentaquark ] .",
    "there is evidence on a @xmath15 level for the production of a pentaquark @xmath16 with a subsequent decay of the @xmath17 into @xmath13 and @xmath18 . for the enormous body of papers related to pentaquark",
    "we refer to a review given by stancu @xcite .",
    "another interesting reaction is @xmath19 on order to reach the threshold of this reaction the maximal energy of cosy had to be lifted above its design value of 2.5 gev .",
    "the data were taken at an energy of 2.65 gev @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the data @xcite resulted in a dominance of the channel @xmath20 with a subsequent decay @xmath21 .    at the big karl",
    "spectrograph the reaction @xmath22 was studied with the momo vertex wall .",
    "= 13 cm    the interest in this reaction stems from the surprising behaviour of two pions in the @xmath23 reaction @xcite .",
    "the latter reaction showed a p - wave between the two pions even close to threshold . in fig .",
    "[ kk_pipi ] the energy spectrum of two kaons for a maximal energy of 35 mev are shown .",
    "besides a smooth continuum the production of @xmath24-mesons is visible .",
    "the energy distribution follows phase space , hence it is s - wave .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the @xmath25@xmath26 system . also the excitation function for the @xmath24 production is an accord with the assumption of s - wave . to summarise : the @xmath25@xmath26 behaves as expected while the @xmath27@xmath26 system shows an unexpected behaviour . in order to proof the findings for this system the experiment was repeated but with inverse kinematics .",
    "the advantage of doing so is a smaller number of settings of the spectrograph .",
    "a result of this measurement is also shown in fig .",
    "[ kk_pipi ] .",
    "it supports the previous findings .",
    "one aspect of strangeness physics is the @xmath28 content in the nucleon .",
    "this is connected to a violation of the ozi - rule in the ratio @xmath29 these two mesons have almost ideal quark mixing and hence the @xmath9 has negligible @xmath28 content while the @xmath24 is an almost pure @xmath28 state ( see previous reaction ) .",
    "tof measured @xmath9 production at exactly the same excess energy as previous @xmath24 production , thus allowing the deduction of @xmath30 as function of excess energy .",
    "this yields @xmath31 while the ozi - rule predicts @xmath32 .",
    "this may point to a serious content of @xmath28 pairs in the nucleon .",
    "there is a wealth of data of light meson production measured at cosy in the threshold region .",
    "the data were taken mainly by the cosy-11 and gem collaborations for the nucleon - nucleon channel @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on @xmath33 and @xmath34 production .",
    "= 6 cm    first , we discuss the production in @xmath2 interactions .",
    "[ eta_exfu ] shows the total cross sections @xcite and references therein as function of the excess energy @xmath35 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate a phase space integral normalised arbitrarily .",
    "the solid lines show the phase space distribution with inclusion of the @xmath36 proton - proton strong and coulomb interactions . in case of the @xmath37 reaction",
    "the solid line was fitted to the data in the excess energy range between 15 and @xmath38 .",
    "additional inclusion of the proton-@xmath33 interaction is indicated by the dotted line .",
    "the scattering length of @xmath39 and the effective range parameter @xmath40 have been chosen arbitrarily .",
    "the dashed - dotted line represents the energy dependence taking into account the contribution from the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 transitions .",
    "preliminary results for the @xmath41 transition with full treatment of three - body effects are shown as a dashed - double - dotted line .",
    "the absolute scale of dashed - double - dotted line was arbitrary fitted to demonstrate the energy dependence only .",
    "to summarise : in @xmath34 production the fsi between the two protons is of importance . in the case of @xmath33 production also",
    "the fsi between the @xmath44 and the two protons matters .",
    "this rather strong interaction has led to the speculation wether bound or quasi - bound @xmath33-nucleus systems may exist .",
    "this will be discussed in other talks at this meeting .",
    "the pdg @xcite reported up to 2002 a rest mass of the @xmath33-meson of @xmath45 mev / c@xmath46 .",
    "then a new measurement by the na48 group at cern reported a larger value @xcite with a very small uncertainty : @xmath47 mev / c@xmath46 .",
    "this value does not within error bars overlap with the previous results .",
    "this measurement made use of the decay @xmath48 .",
    "gem performed an experiment with a different technique proof this result with uncertainties within the same order of magnitude .",
    "the idea is a self calibrating experiment making use of the following three reactions : @xmath49 at a beam momentum around @xmath50 mev / c the @xmath51 ions being emitted forward , the @xmath52 s being emitted backward in the centre of mass system as well as the @xmath26 ions being emitted backward are within the acceptance of the magnetic spectrograph .",
    "reactions [ eqn : rea1 ] and [ eqn : rea2 ] are in principe used to calibrate the detector and the accelerator .",
    "reaction [ eqn : rea3 ] is then used to determine via the missing mass technique the @xmath33 mass .",

    "[ eta_mass ] .",
    "it shows excellent agreement with the previously published values except the one from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we will proceed to @xmath54 reactions with @xmath55 or @xmath56 and @xmath57 . here",
    "we will start with pion production .",
    "a series of angular distributions was measured by gem , in order to study possible violations of isospin symmetry @xcite .",
    "two components were found : one depending strongly on the emission angle and thus on the momentum transfer , another one which is almost isotropic . in the first component a violation of isospin symmetry was found .",
    "the data also serve to investigate the production mechanism .",
    "this has to be understood before more complicated reactions as multi - pion production or @xmath33 production can be understood .",
    "a calculation which goes beyond the locher - weber type calculations @xcite was performed recently by canton and levchuk @xcite .",
    "they treated the three nucleon wave functions in the isi within the ags formalism .",
    "their results are compared with gem data in fig .",
    "[ pd2pihe3 ] .",
    "one can see that the isotropic component strongly depends on isi .",
    "the paris @xmath58 potential seems to slightly underestimate the experiment .",
    "we now proceed to the @xmath59 reaction which is of great interest , since the @xmath33-nucleus interaction should be more attractive than in the @xmath2 case . from the differential cross sections",
    "one can deduce a matrix element @xmath60 as @xmath61 the right hand side is valid for @xmath62-wave production with fsi in the exit channel . with @xmath63 the production matrix element and with @xmath64 the fsi matrix element are denoted .",

    "@xcite analysed near threshold data in this way .",
    "later , sibirtsev et al .",
    "@xcite extended the range to the then available data .",
    "their value for the @xmath65 scattering length is @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting angle integrated matrix element is shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ iso_threshold ] as function of the of the @xmath33 momentum @xmath67 .",
    "this is in agreement with model calculations for instance those of khemchandani et al .",
    "@xcite . they calculated the cross section in a two - step model .",
    "in a first step a pion is produced in a nucleon - nucleon interaction while in the second step this pion is scattered at the spectator nucleon @xmath68 with eventual fusion of the three nucleons .",
    "the agreement between data and [ equ : matrix ] is nice up to @xmath69 @xmath70 ( the data from cosy 11 are still preliminary ) . also shown in the figure is the matrix element of a resonance model @xcite without fsi enhancement .",
    "therefore it underestimates the data close to threshold .",
    "there are ambiguities between the data .",
    "angular distributions close to threshold are isotropic as expected . at higher energies the data from ref.s @xcite",
    "show a strong forward peaking while the data from @xcite peak at @xmath71 .",
    "this could be reproduced by the calculations performed by stenmark @xcite . however , this approach is based on the ad hoc assumption of the intermediate pion to be limited into a narrow forward cone , as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the gem collaboration studied isospin symmetry breaking by comparing neutral and charged pion production in @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite reactions , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 reactions @xcite . for the latter reactions it was found that the angular distribution of the matrix elements consists of two parts .",
    "an exponential part showing scaling which is attributed to a one step reaction .",
    "this part shows isospin symmetry breaking .",
    "the second component is isotropic and is related to two step processes .",
    "it does not show isospin symmetry breaking .",
    "the origin of isospin symmetry breaking is in addition to the coulomb force a difference in the masses of the up and down quark .",
    "it was suggested @xcite to study the @xmath75 reaction at maximal momentum transfer around the @xmath33-production threshold .",
    "this channel should be sensitive to @xmath76-@xmath33 mixing with the mixing angle being dependent on the different quark masses .    on the contrary",
    "the @xmath74 reaction should not show such an interference effect .",
