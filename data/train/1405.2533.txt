    "in computer aided geometric design and geometric modeling , we often use some common surface to construct a complex model .",
    "these common surfaces are generally called basic modeling surfaces , and they should have some advantages such as simple and widely used .",
    "the simple surfaces refer the ones with low degree , for instance , quadratic surfaces @xcite and cubic surfaces @xcite .",
    "the widely used surface refer the ones common in industrial design , for instance , ruled surfaces @xcite , swept surfaces @xcite and translational surfaces @xcite . then a primary task is to have a well study for these basic modeling surfaces .",
    "certainly , how to represent these surface is the first problem in studying surface .",
    "as we know , two representation forms are usually used as parametric form and implicit form . for the parametric representation ,",
    "it is a main popular geometric representation in cg and cad  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to render and is helpful for some geometric operations , such as the computation of curvature or bounds and the control of position or tangency .",
    "however , it is difficult in positional relationship determination and collision detection .",
    "another limitation is that the parametric surfaces have lower ability in topology comparing with the implicit surfaces .",
    "this is also the reason that modeling technology of implicit surfaces is increasing in more applications .",
    "however , it is difficult to classify and control the implicit surfaces .",
    "hence , it is a problem to determining some basic modeling surfaces in the implicit form , and furthermore , find a parametric representation if it has .    in this paper",
    ", we prefer to study the translational surface which is commonly used in industrial design .",
    "the translational surface is a simple solution to the problem of interpolating a surface passing through two curves .",
    "hence , people generally give two space curves @xmath0 and @xmath1 with parametrizations @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , and the two curves define a translational surface @xmath4 .",
    "however , as we mentioned above , newly geometric modeling often begin with implicit equations @xcite . in this situation , for better control and design ,",
    "it is necessary to find the basic modeling surface and compute their parametric representations if exist .",
    "the main task of this paper is to parametrize a given algebraic translational surface . considering the parametric form of translational surface ,",
    "the two variables are separated .",
    "based on this fact we firstly find a space curve which can play the role @xmath0 .",
    "then we compute a parametrization @xmath2 for it .",
    "successively , we find @xmath1 and compute a parametrization @xmath3 for it . finally , we get a parametrization @xmath4 for the given algebraic translational surface .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce some preliminaries and previous results ( see section 2 ) . in section 3",
    ", we show a necessary and sufficient condition for that an algebraic surface has a parametric representation of the form @xmath4 .",
    "the proof is constructive , and then a method for computing @xmath5 is developed .",
