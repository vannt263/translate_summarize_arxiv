    "quantifying correlations in quantum systems is an important issue in quantum information theory . from an hierarchical picture ,",
    "measures of correlations can be classified into three parts : total correlations , quantum correlations , classical correlations @xcite .",
    "roughly specking , _ total correlation _",
    "encapsulates all the correlations in a composite system , including quantum and classical correlations .",
    "contrarily , _ entanglement _ is a well - known measure of quantum correlation which does not take into account the classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "it has been identified that entanglement is a necessary condition for providing exponential speed - up in quantum computation @xcite and is taken as a useful resource for various quantum information processing .",
    "recently , another class of quantum correlation , _ quantum discord _ , is proposed @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that discord characterizes quantum correlation better in terms of computational advantage and the operational meanings of discord have recently begun to be understood @xcite .    from the spirit of multipartite correlation which quantifies overall amount of correlation , it is natural to think about the relationships between the multipartite correlation in total system and the bipartite correlations of subsystems .",
    "a basic example is that , for a tripartite system a - b - c , tripartite correlation is required to be equal to or greater than bipartite correlation in any subsystem .",
    "also , a measures of tripartite correlations should be reduced to a measures of bipartite correlations in a subsystem when a party has completely no correlation with the other parties . for the case of total correlation ,",
    "such relationships are well - defined by additivity relations .",
    "we are questioning here whether such relations are generally satisfied for different measures of _ quantum correlations _ , e.g. , entanglement and discord .",
    "formal definition of total correlation is given as an optimal distance of entropy between a given state and a state without any correlation , _",
    "product state_. a multipartite state is called product state if the state of a @xmath0-party quantum system @xmath1 is written as a product , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a positive operator in the hilbert space @xmath4 . the total information can be represented as @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ] is the relative entropy and `` @xmath7 '' denotes the minimization of @xmath8 over @xmath9 within a product state @xmath10 . after a simple algebra",
    ", it can be proved that the closest product state to a state @xmath11 is the product of reduced states , @xmath12 @xcite where @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 means trace out of all the state except the state in the @xmath15th hilbert space .",
    "therefore , for an arbitrary multipartite state , it can be written in a different way as @xmath16 where @xmath17 $ ] is von neumann entropy @xcite .",
    "the quantity is sometimes called as total mutual information since the total information becomes mutual information when the system is bipartite , as @xmath18 defined in a bipartite system @xmath19 @xcite . in terms of the quantum relative entropy , @xmath20 .    a physical state @xmath21 of @xmath0-party quantum system @xmath1",
    "is called separable if the state can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a state in @xmath24 . by definition ,",
    "the state is considered to have no entanglement and it is a type of multipartite state which can be prepared in a classical methods , i.e. , local operation and classical communication . under the circumstance , a measure of entanglement",
    "can be characterized using a distance measure between a given state and the closest separable state , called the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement is defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the set of separable states .",
    "the measure of entanglement is naturally applied to multipartite systems as the criterion of separable states has been well - defined for a multipartite system .",
    "in addition , the notion of quantum correlation can be greatly extended once the notion of state distance from classically correlated states instead of separable states is considered @xcite .",
    "a physical state @xmath27 of a @xmath0-party quantum system @xmath1 is called classically correlated if the state can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a local basis at @xmath31-th site .",
    "the states are considered to have no entanglement since they are convex sum of product states .",
    "the relative entropy of discord @xcite is defined to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the set of classically correlated states . due to its definition ,",
    "the measure of discord is also naturally applied to multipartite systems .    as it was seen from their definition , the total mutual information ,",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement , and the relative entropy of discord are multipartite measures of correlations in a unified view of correlations .",
    "those measures have the clear relationship @xmath34 because @xmath35 , and they also enable us to compare the three criteria of correlation , product states , classically correlated states , and separable states .    in the following section , we discuss about the additivity relation in the total correlation , entanglement and discord .",
    "we derive four different additivity relationships using the total correlation ( [ eq : total ] ) and shows that whether similar type of correlation can be derived for the case of entanglement and discord . in the section iii , it is shown that the additivity relationship is satisfied by a specific class of states .",
    "as specific examples , we will deal the generalized ghz - states , a variant of the generalized ghz - states , the generalized w - states , and a few mixed states . in the section iv",
    ", we summarize our result and presents the conclusion on the additivity relationship in quantum correlations .",
    "in this section , we discuss about the additivity relation of multipartite correlations . at first , we discuss that how a multipartite correlation in general can be related with sets of bipartite correlations .",
    "we will show that the relationship is led to three different types of inequalities .",
    "it is our main question whether such inequalities are satisfied for the case of quantum correlations so that we will study the relationships between multipartite and bipartite quantum correlations using entanglement as well as quantum discord .",
    "the total information counts all the correlation existing in a multipartite system .",
    "the structure of multipartite correlation is quite complicated in general although there are rules by which they can be decomposed into the correlations of subsystems .",
    "in fact , the total mutual information of a tripartite a - b - c system can in principle be decomposed by two different types of bipartite correlations as such @xmath36 and the equality holds for any permutation of a , b , and c. the equation shows how the tripartite correlation is quantified in terms of bipartite correlations .",
    "if we consider only the subsystem a - b among the total system , there is only correlation between a and b. in addition , if a system c is joined to the subsystem a - b , it is natural to understand that the total amount of correlation is increased and the amount corresponds to the correlation existing between the subsystem a - b together with the correlation between a - b and the additional system c. the additional correlation is taken by the term @xmath37 while it is still characterized by the bipartite correlation between two different subsystems , a - b and c.    the relation between the multipartite correlation and the bipartite correlations has been well summarized in the famous strong subadditivity relation of shannon entropy @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the inequality is easy to prove in general , while the quantum version of the strong subadditivity with von neumann entropy is difficult .",
    "the strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy @xmath17 $ ] @xcite refers to the following inequality for tripartite quantum state @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the strong subadditivity is widely used in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "the proof of the inequality and its operational meaning can be found in @xcite .    using the strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy ,",
    "the bounds on the total mutual information are obtained as @xmath45 from the definition , it is straightforward to show that the three inequalities above are equivalent to the strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy .",
    "the strong subadditivity frequently has been represented in the form of eq .",
    "@xcite , but it can also be represented in the forms of eqs .   and by using the tripartite total mutual information .",
    "we can give intuitive interpretations of the three inequalities .",
    "the first inequality states that the correlation between a - b and c contains the correlation between a and c. the correlation between a and b is missing in the right - hand side .",
    "the second inequality is also intuitively clear because the left - hand side of the inequality counts all the correlations among a , b , and c , so it is greater than or equal to the correlations between a - b and a - c only . in that case",
    ", it can be said that the correlation between b and c has not been counted . in the third inequality ,",
    "both two terms of the right - hand side contain the correlation between a and c ( i.e. , double counting ) , so it is less than or equal to the tripartite correlation .",
    "those relations between the correlations in a tripartite system a - b - c are represented in the conceptual diagrams in fig .",
    "[ conceptual ] .",
    "the total information covers all the correlations in both a classical part and a quantum part .",
    "one may wonder that there exist the consistent inequalities as ( [ total equality ] ) , ( [ total bound 1 ] ) , ( [ total bound 2 ] ) and ( [ total bound 3 ] ) for the measures of quantum correlations . a natural candidate for quantum correlation is quantum entanglement .",
    "there are several measures of entanglement which have been studied extensively so far @xcite .",
    "however , our question requires a measure which can be naturally generalized to multipartite systems and which is consistent to the quantum part of total information in eq .  .",
    "a proper measure in that purpose is the relative entropy of entanglement which is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : relative ] ) .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement is always less than or equal to the total information and is naturally generalized to multipartite systems .    for the relative entropy of entanglement",
    ", there exists an inequality which corresponds to eq .   of the total information .",
    "the authors of @xcite first showed that the following inequality holds for any tripartite pure system a - b - c .",
    "@xmath46 they derived it by using the inequality @xmath47 @xcite , which holds for any state @xmath40 and for any tri - separable state @xmath48 . unlike the equation of the total mutual information , eq .",
    "is an inequality .",
    "it means that the tripartite entanglement contains entanglement between a , b and ab , c but they are not exactly same .    also , the following inequality holds for any tripartite system a - b - c : @xmath49 it can be derived directly from the monotonicity of the relative entropy under partial trace , @xmath50 @xcite .    combining eqs .   and gives the following inequalities which hold for any tripartite pure system a - b - c : @xmath51 at the same time , a symmetrized version of the inequality can be found as @xmath52 $ ] by taking the average of eq .   over all permutations of a , b , and c.",
    "the inequality corresponds to eq .   of the total mutual information .",
    "it is a weaker inequality than the monogamy inequality of entanglement @xmath53 , which is not known if it holds for the entanglement measure .",
    "it is not an unique property of quantum correlations .",
    "we can see the analogy in the classical correlations between classical random variables . for three classical random variables",
    "x , y and z , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a multivariate mutual information .    there is also the same form of upper bound for the regularized relative entropy of entanglement @xmath56 , @xmath57 which holds for any tripartite pure system . the inequality is also proven in @xcite , and it follows from the fact the @xmath58 is an entanglement monotone .    therefore , it is possible to conclude that similar kinds of additivity relationship with total correlation are satisfied for the case of entanglement .",
    "although it is found that they do not coincide sharply , they asymptotically behave in the same way .",
    "now we consider the quantum discord in eq .",
    "( [ eq : discord ] ) as another candidate of quantum correlations .",
    "it is well - known that the criterion of non - zero quantum discord is not identical to the criterion of non - zero entanglement . unlike entanglement",
    ", quantum discord is defined to be non - zero even when a state is separable .",
    "the difference makes it non - trivial to consider whether there exist the consistent additivity relations as eqs .",
    "( [ total equality ] ) to ( [ total bound 3 ] ) for quantum discord in multipartite systems .",
    "we take the relative entropy of discord in eq .",
    "( [ eq : discord ] ) as quantum discord measure . the relative entropy of discord differs from the relative entropy of entanglement in the set of states whose minimization should be taken .",
    "it enable us to genuinely compare the difference in the separability criterion and the classicality criterion .",
    "first , we show that there is the consistent lower bound on the tripartite relative entropy of discord .",
    "the minimization in @xmath59 can be reduced to a minimization over set of local bases @xmath60 @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 . for the matter of convenience , we write @xmath63 instead of @xmath40 from now on .",

    "the outcomes of the local measurements can be treated as three classical random variables , which are denoted x , y and z. they correspond to the outcomes of the local measurements on a , b and c respectively . for any classical random variables",
    "x , y and z , shannon entropies satisfy @xmath70 .",
    "using this inequality , @xmath71 , so the proof is completed .",

    "we have discussed about the consistent additivity relations for the multipartite measures of total correlations and quantum correlations .",
    "it would also be worth to consider the relations for multipartite measures of classical correlations . in terms of the quantum relative entropy , a measure of classical correlations",
