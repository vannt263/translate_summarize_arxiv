    "in the past two decades , a great effort has been devoted to the study of diffusion and transport in disordered media by models based on random walks  @xcite .",
    "basically , the dynamics of the system can be described by a master equation for a particular probability distribution .",
    "two alternative ways are usually employed .",
    "the first one is based on the probability @xmath0 that the walker is on site @xmath1 at time @xmath2 when starting from the origin at @xmath3 . the second way",
    "consists of analyzing the statistics of the exit time from a given region . in both cases ,",
    "there are exact enumeration techniques which enable us to calculate the corresponding observable in all the possible disorder configurations .",
    "thus , we can numerically reckon the distribution over disorder of the probability @xmath0 , or the moments @xmath4 of this distribution @xcite . in an analogous manner",
    ", we can numerically evaluate the distribution of the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) over disorder , or its moments  @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distribution over disorder and @xmath7 is a real number not necessarily integer .",
    "the crucial point of diffusion in disordered media is that transport can be _ anomalous _ , i.e. , the mean square displacement of a random walk scales with time as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the anomalous diffusion exponent .",
    "a relevant property of the anomalous diffusion is that it leads to broad distributions .",
    "their moments can not be described by a single exponent but an infinite hierarchy of exponents is needed to characterize them  @xcite .",
    "this fact enables us to study the distributions over disorder with the multifractal formalism  @xcite .",
    "random walks on random fractals ( such as the infinite percolation cluster at criticality ) are processes with anomalous diffusion , which are characterized by logarithmically broad distribution functions reflecting an underlying multifractal structure @xcite .",
    "an important issue in these systems is the nature of the multifractality based on the dynamical process or in the steady state ( as the voltage drop distribution in percolation ) . for the voltage drop distribution , the multifractal behavior is well established for all values of @xmath7  @xcite ; whereas for the dynamical diffusive process the multifractality only appears in a range of values of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "another property of these processes is that while the multifractal behavior appears in the distribution of the probability @xmath0 , it is not present in the mean number of distinct sites visited by a particle diffusing on the percolating cluster  @xcite . another dynamical process with `` ultra - anomalous ''",
    "slow motion is the sinai model  @xcite for diffusion in a linear chain in the presence of random fields .",
    "for this model , the mean square displacement of a random walk follows asymptotically @xmath10 .",
    "several studies  @xcite have established the multifractal properties of the model .",
    "however , the origin of the multifractality in this process is yet an open question .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the sinai model and we address the last question .",
    "particularly , we compare the behavior of the mfpt distributions over disorder and its moments for two processes with dichotomic disorder .",
    "one of them is the sinai model and the other is a nonanomalous biased random walk in a finite disordered chain .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mfpt ] , we present expressions for the mfpt for a given realization of the ( quenched ) disorder in the chain .",
    "the description of the models of disorder , employed in our studies , is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] .",
    "the moments of the mfpt distribution over disorder diverge with the system s size .",
    "these divergences are characterized by the scaling exponents @xmath11 in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi ] , where we employ the multifractal formalism  @xcite to calculate the exponents @xmath12 of the corresponding partition function .",
    "also , the generalized renyi dimensions @xmath13 , and the spectra @xmath14 are given in that section . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : fin ] , we briefly summarize the results of our work .",
    "we consider the continuous time dynamics of a random walk on a discrete one - dimensional lattice with nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "the walker jumps from site @xmath15 to site @xmath16 with transition probability per unit time @xmath17 , or to site @xmath18 with transition probability per unit time @xmath19 .",
    "we are concerned with the exit time of the walker from the finite interval @xmath20 $ ] on the chain , with at least one absorbing end . the average of the survival time until the absorption , over realizations of the random walk , is the mfpt .",
    "recently , we have obtained a general exact expression for the mfpt for a fixed set of transition probabilities @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the mfpt if the walker initially began at site @xmath23 .",
    "for an interval with both absorbing extremes @xmath24 we get @xmath25 in this work we fix the starting point @xmath26 ( defining @xmath27 ) and we consider two possible boundary conditions . the first one is the interval @xmath28 $ ] with absorbing - absorbing ( aa ) extremes .",
    "the total number of sites , @xmath29 , in the interval is @xmath30 .",
    "the mfpt for this case is given by eq .",
    "( [ mfpt : aa ] ) taking @xmath31 .",
    "the second case is the interval @xmath32 $ ] with reflecting - absorbing ( ra ) ends . here , @xmath33 and from eq .",

    "this fact leads us to consider also the aa boundary conditions in the problem of multifractality of the mfpt distribution over disorder .",
    "in finite discrete systems , we can enumerate all the configurations @xmath38 of disorder .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 the mfpt for the @xmath40th realization of the quenched disorder .",
    "we stress that all the configurations of disorder are equally probable .",
    "however , the resulting values @xmath39 are distributed by @xmath6 , the mfpt distribution over disorder .",
    "thus , we can compute exactly the moments of the mfpt distribution , given the set of values @xmath41 , from the definition given by eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) , @xmath42 in particular , the mfpt averaged over disorder results in @xmath43 . for dichotomic models of disorder , in a chain with @xmath29 sites , there are @xmath44 possible realizations of the random lattice , which can be easily enumerated .",
    "the set of values @xmath45 can be exactly calculated employing expression  ( [ mfpt : aa ] ) for the aa boundary conditions , or by eq .",
    "( [ mfpt : ra_0 ] ) for the ra extremes .",
    "now , we assume that the hopping probabilities @xmath46 are strictly positive random variables , chosen independently from site to site and identically distributed .",
    "additionaly , we admit that the site transition probabilities are not necessarily symmetric in the sense that @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we can incorporate the effects of bias in to the chain by external fields .",
    "we select the first distribution for the transition probabilities in such a way that they satisfy the sinai condition  @xcite , namely , the random variable @xmath48 has zero mean and finite variance @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we consider a dichotomic model by defining @xmath50 and prescribing @xmath51 to be equal to @xmath52 with equal probabilities .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 measures the strength of disorder , and can take values between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 corresponds to a simple homogeneous random walk , and for @xmath57 we get a disordered random walk with local bias ( random field ) .",
    "it is easily verified that the above prescriptions satisfy the sinai condition .",
    "particularly , we obtain @xmath58 , where @xmath59 . in the asymptotic limit @xmath60 , the variance diverges .",
    "the mfpt averaged over disorder for the dichotomic sinai model diverges as @xmath61 for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 @xcite , whereas the typical value of the first - passage time , defined as @xmath64 , diverges slower , as @xmath65  @xcite . here , the brackets @xmath66 denote the average over disorder .",
    "therefore , the distribution of the mfpt over the sinai disorder has a power - law tail  @xcite .",
    "it is easily seen that the largest value of the mfpt , @xmath67 , is obtained for the ra ends when at all the sites , the right jump transition is @xmath68 , and the left jump transition is @xmath69 . in the asymptotic limit of @xmath62",
