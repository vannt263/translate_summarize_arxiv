    "in the process of deflagration - to - detonation transition ( ddt ) in tubes with a closed end , a slow premixed flame accelerates spontaneously from the closed end and triggers detonation .",
    "a qualitative explanation of the process was first proposed by shelkin , ref .",
    "@xcite . according to this scenario , the burned gas expands and drives a flow in the fuel mixture .",
    "the flow becomes nonuniform because of the no - slip boundary condition at the wall which , together with turbulence , distorts the flame front , increases the burning rate , and leads to the acceleration .",
    "an accelerating flame front pushes compression waves that continuously heat the fuel mixture ahead of it until an explosion is triggered that eventually develops into a detonation .",
    "while the shelkin mechanism relies prominently on the action of turbulence , it was recently shown theoretically that flame acceleration is possible even in its absence , in tubes with smooth adiabatic wall @xcite .",
    "this theory has been validated by extensive numerical simulations in refs .",
    "@xcite and supported by experiments in smooth micro - tubes @xcite . the theory and modeling",
    "further demonstrate that laminar flame acceleration becomes quite weak in wide tubes with increasing reynolds number of the flow , and as such loss to the wall may actually terminate the process .",
    "thus obstacles placed in the tube @xcite appear to be an essential factor in order to overcome the loss and consequently support the ddt .",
    "it is generally believed that these obstacles generate stronger turbulence , which increases the burning rate and facilitates the flame acceleration .",
    "however , in our recent work @xcite we have demonstrated that the obstacles play a more important role than just producing turbulence , in that they provide a specific physical mechanism of flame acceleration that is qualitatively different from the shelkin mechanism .",
    "this new mechanism is extra strong , providing flame acceleration that is independent of the reynolds number , through the tube width , and as such may be quite important for technical applications .",
    "specifically , flame propagation in an obstructed channel creates pockets of fresh fuel mixture between the obstacles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "gas expansion due to delayed burning in the pockets produces a powerful jet flow in the unobstructed part of the channel .",
    "the jet flow renders the flame tip to propagate much faster , which produces new pockets , generates a positive feedback between the flame and the flow , and leads to flame acceleration .",
    "the accelerating flame reaches supersonic speed with respect to the tube wall , and consequently triggers explosion and detonation .",
    "the present paper extends the work of bychkov et al . ,",
    "@xcite , in which the basic concepts of the new mechanism were outlined , by presenting details of the theory and simulations .",
    "specifically , we discuss the influence of the planar / axisymmetric flow geometry and gas compression on the acceleration rate .",
    "we show that the flame accelerates much faster in cylindrical tubes than in planar channels , and that the acceleration is slowed down due to gas compression . furthermore , as the mach number of the flow increases , the acceleration process saturates to statistically steady flame propagation at supersonic speed with respect to the tube wall .",
    "this saturation state may develop prior to the attainment of explosion and then detonation .",
    "the flame speed in this state may be correlated with the chapman - jouguet ( cj ) deflagration speed and with the state of fast flames observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "finally , we demonstrate numerically that flame acceleration may lead to explosion and detonation triggering .",
    "figure [ fig-1 ] is a schematic of the problem under study .",
    "the flame propagates from the closed end of a semi - infinite channel of half - width ( radius ) @xmath0 , with a fraction @xmath1 blocked by obstacles .",
    "the central part of the channel , of half - width @xmath2 , is unobstructed .",
    "the flame propagates extremely fast along the unobstructed part of the channel , leaving behind pockets of unburned mixture , between the obstacles , which will be burned later .",
    "the deep narrow spaces between the obstacles , namely the pockets , act as mini - channels in which the flame can be considered to propagate mainly in the radial direction .",
    "this assumption is most appropriate when the obstacles are placed close to each other with deep pockets , @xmath3 , and with slip boundary conditions at the wall . in general , burning in the pockets depends on the obstacle geometry , whose influence will be discussed later .",
    "we nevertheless recognize qualitatively the same mechanism of flame acceleration in simulations and experiments involving complicated obstacle shapes @xcite .",
    "we now briefly state the fundamental concepts of the new mechanism presented in ref .",
    "we employ the standard model of an infinitesimally thin flame front propagating normally to itself with the unstretched laminar flame velocity @xmath4 . the tube wall is ideally slip and adiabatic .",
    "non - slip boundary condition is not needed for flame acceleration in the new mechanism and the reynolds number is not involved in the calculations . at the initial stage of flame acceleration , the flow may be treated as incompressible , @xmath5 while the fresh gas trapped in the pockets is burning .",
    "expansion of the burnt gas is characterized by the density ratio of the fuel mixture and the burnt gas , @xmath6 , which is quite large for most flames , with @xmath7 . in the model of a planar laminar flame front in the pockets ,",
    "the fuel mixture in a pocket is at rest , while the burnt gas is pushed out with the velocity @xmath8 , see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ( b ) .",
    "this value determines the gas velocity at the border of the unobstructed part of the channel @xmath9 the shape of the flame tip is of minor importance for the present mechanism , and it may be taken to be planar at all times . consequently , the flow of the burnt gas in the unobstructed channel part is potential .",
    "accounting for boundary condition ( [ eq1a ] ) , we find the flow velocity @xmath10 the propagation speed of the infinitesimally thin flame front with respect to the burnt gas is @xmath11 using the velocity distribution ( [ eq2 ] ) , we find @xmath12 integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) with the initial condition @xmath13 , we obtain a strong exponential acceleration of the flame tip @xmath14},\\ ] ] with the scaled acceleration rate @xmath15 the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] )  ( [ eq6 ] ) explains the basis of the new acceleration mechanism presented in ref .",
    "this mechanism is quite powerful , with the acceleration rate ( [ eq6 ] ) much larger than that of the shelkin mechanism in smooth tubes @xcite .",
    "the scaled acceleration rate does not depend on the reynolds number , and hence the viscosity and the tube width .",
    "as will be discussed below , viscosity and turbulence may induce supplementary effects in the new acceleration mechanism . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this new acceleration mechanism has many features in common with the acceleration of finger flames , refs .",
    "@xcite , although the finger flame acceleration is quite limited in time , yielding maximum increase in the burning rate by a factor of only 10 - 15 relative to the planar flame speed @xcite . in contrast , the new physical mechanism leads to supersonic flame propagation with respect to the tube wall , with possible transition to explosion and detonation .",
    "it was also demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the new mechanism remains effective even when the flame skirt touches the main wall of the channel",
    ".        theoretical understanding of the new acceleration mechanism enables the analysis of the optimal obstacle geometry for flame acceleration .",
    "figure [ fig-4 ] shows typical obstacle shapes discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . specifically , in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] ( a ) we have rectangular obstacles of thickness @xmath16 and spacing @xmath17 . in this case",
    "delayed burning occurs only between the obstacles , while the volume occupied by an obstacle itself is ineffective for flame acceleration . averaging volume production in the burning process over the obstacle step , we rewrite the boundary condition ( [ eq1a ] ) as @xmath18 which leads to the reduced acceleration rate @xmath19 thus , thinner obstacles produce stronger acceleration .",
    "another possible factor suggested was obstacle phase shift at the bottom of the channel in comparison to that at the top .",
    "this suggestion , however , is not expected to substantially affect the laminar flame dynamics , although it could influence the turbulence generated in the flow in later stages . the triangular obstacle shape in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] ( b ) also renders the flame acceleration slower because it reduces the volume of the fresh fuel mixture trapped between the obstacles .",
    "consequently , the optimal design for flame acceleration is that of the infinitely thin obstacles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . for a fixed tube radius @xmath0",
    ", maximum acceleration rate is achieved for maximum possible blockage ratio , i.e. for minimum value of @xmath20 . however , for a fixed width of the free channel part @xmath20 , the acceleration rate does not depend on the total tube radius @xmath0 , i.e. it does not depend on the depth of the pockets .",
    "this is true , of course , only when pockets are sufficiently deep with @xmath21 comparable to unity .",
    "very small obstacles ( @xmath22 ) can not be treated as obstacles and the new mechanism is ineffective .",
    "still , typical experimental configurations employ obstacles with the blockage ratio of @xmath23 , for which the present mechanism is quite effective . the dimensional acceleration rate @xmath24 is determined by the expansion factor @xmath25 , the laminar flame velocity @xmath4 and the half - width of the unobstructed channel part @xmath26 .",
    "the theoretical model of a laminar flow does not predict any dependence of the acceleration rate on the spacing between the obstacles . as we shall demonstrate numerically in sec .",
    "4 , the spacing between the obstacles determines primarily the amplitude of the velocity pulsations ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . still , these pulsations do not change the average acceleration rate , which remains quite close to the predictions of the theoretical model .",

    "furthermore , this correction becomes important only when the leading part of the flame skirt has almost touched the main wall , when burning in the first pocket is almost finished . at the beginning of the burning process",

    "( [ eq34 ] ) .",

    "2 predicts considerably stronger flame acceleration as compared to the planar case .",
    "figure [ fig-7 ] shows the velocity of the flame tip versus the position in the tube for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and demonstrates much faster flame acceleration .",
    "the growth rate is about twice larger in agreement with eqs .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) , ( [ eq34 ] ) .",
    "however , quantitative agreement between the theory and simulation in the axisymmetric case is not as good as in the planar geometry . in the planar case of fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] , the quantitative difference is less than 5% , while in the axisymmetric case this difference increases from about 10% at the beginning to 20% at later time .",
    "equation ( [ eq34 ] ) provides better agreement with the simulation than eq .",
    "( [ eq41 ] ) , which may indicate a minor role of the radius growth for the flame skirt in the pockets .",
    "this effect may be observed directly for the flame shape in the axisymmetric geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-8 ] , which shows that even minor penetration of the flame skirt into the pockets between the obstacles provides quite strong flame acceleration in the axisymmetric geometry . for comparison ,",
    "the flame skirt penetrates much deeper into the pockets in the planar case of fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ]  ( a ) .",
    "we also observe that the difference between theory and modeling becomes larger in fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] as the flame velocity increases .",
    "the quantitative difference of 10 - 20% in the axisymmetric case is partly related to the influence of viscosity and the moderate tube width , corresponding to moderate values of the reynolds number .",
    "as obtained in numerical studies of the early acceleration of finger flames @xcite , moderate tube width reduces flame acceleration as compared to the theory . however , there are also other reasons that cause a reduction of the flame acceleration in the numerical modeling .",
    "the first is the incompressibility assumption of the theory .",
    "this assumption is acceptable at the beginning of the acceleration , but deteriorates as the local mach number increases as the flame accelerates .",
    "the deviation develops faster for the axisymmetric geometry because of its faster acceleration . in order to study the influence of gas compression on the flame acceleration , we investigated the dependence of the scaled acceleration rate @xmath103 on the initial mach number , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-9 ] for various values of the blockage ratio .",
    "it is thus seen that the scaled acceleration rate decreases strongly with the mach number . for initial mach number @xmath117 instead of @xmath118 , the acceleration rate",
    "is approximately reduced by a factor of two .    ; other parameters are the same as for fig .",
    "[ fig-11 ] . ]",
    "the slowdown of flame acceleration because of gas compression agrees with the concept that the flame propagation velocity can not exceed the value of the chapman - jouguet ( cj ) limiting state , for which the downstream flow is sonic .",
    "we therefore expect saturation of the flame tip velocity to a certain steady value at the end of the acceleration process , but prior to an explosion . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig-10 ] demonstrates for the planar geometry such a saturation , obtained in the numerical simulation at the final stage of flame acceleration , for various blockage ratios . the initial mach number in fig .",
    "[ fig-10 ] is @xmath119 , and the saturation velocity is about @xmath120 . for comparison ,",
    "one - dimensional theory predicts the cj deflagration velocity with respect to the wall in the limit of large energy release ( @xmath121 as @xmath122}\\sqrt { 2{\\frac{{\\theta - 1}}{{\\gamma + 1}}}}.\\ ] ] in the present case of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , eq .",
    "( [ eq59 ] ) yields @xmath123 , which is about the saturation velocity obtained in the present numerical simulation .",
    "more accurate theoretical calculation of the cj deflagration velocity without the assumption of @xmath124 yields @xmath125 , which is also close to the present numerical results .",
    "finally , we discuss how flame acceleration in channels with obstacles may lead to ddt .",
    "since the time and position of ddt are quite sensitive to the chemical kinetics adopted , our results on detonation triggering should be considered as qualitative .",
    "at the same time , they demonstrate the general features of ddt irrespective of the particular fuel mixture .",
    "it is well known that any flame propagating from a closed end pushes a flow in the fuel mixture with a weak shock / compression wave at the head of the flow .",
    "the flame acceleration renders the compression wave stronger , until it develops into a shock of considerable amplitude .",
    "preheating of the fuel mixture by the shock is conventionally considered as one of the main elements of ddt both in smooth tubes and in channels with obstacles .",
    "the temperature behind the shock increases and the reaction time in any compressed gas parcel decreases drastically .",
    "the decrease in the reaction time may result in explosion and ddt ahead of the flame front unless the parcel is burnt by the flame before active explosion is initiated .",
    "thus , in general , we may expect two possible outcomes for the flame acceleration : 1 ) if the reaction time behind the shock is sufficiently short , then it drives the explosion and ddt ; 2 ) the reaction time may be longer than the interval available for a gas parcel to travel between the shock and the flame . in this case explosion",
    "does not occur and the final state of flame acceleration is the cj deflagration .",
    "for comparison , the possibility of spontaneous explosion ahead of an accelerating flame was considered in the theory @xcite for smooth tubes .",
    "both cj detonation and deflagration have also been found in smooth tubes experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite . in channels with obstacles , the state of cj deflagration",
    "is also known as `` fast flames '' @xcite . in the present simulations we observed both possibilities of ddt and cj deflagration for different reaction kinetics .",
    "taking reaction of the first order with respect to density ( designated by @xmath126 in fig .",
    "[ fig-10 ] ) , we obtained statistically steady cj deflagration at the end of flame acceleration with no explosion or ddt , see fig .",
    "[ fig-10 ] .",
    "this result indicates that the decrease in the reaction time behind the shock is not sufficient , and gas parcels are consumed by the flame front before spontaneous reaction develops into a powerful explosion .",
    "thus , in order to observe ddt , we need to take another reaction mechanism , which is more sensitive to pressure and temperature increase in the shock .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we considered a reaction of the second order with respect to density , @xmath108 , and obtained explosion triggering and ddt , see fig .",
    "[ fig-10 ] .",
    "remarkably , in this case the reaction rate is so sensitive to pressure and temperature that the ddt occurs before the flame reaches the cj deflagration state .",
    "figure [ fig-11 ] shows characteristic temperature snapshots at the ddt .",
    "it is seen that the accelerating flame acts like a piston pushing a shock , which raises the temperature of the fuel mixture ahead of the flame , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-11 ] ( a , b ) . the snapshot of fig .",
    "[ fig-11 ] ( c ) already corresponds to detonation .",
    "development of the temperature profiles ahead of the flame front along the channel axis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-12 ] for the time instants @xmath127 close to the ddt time . unlike the case of smooth tube with monotonic temperature distribution in the compression wave @xcite , in fig .",
    "[ fig-12 ] we observe noticeable temperature pulsation due to secondary shocks reflected from the obstacles .",
    "the main tendency nevertheless remains the same : we can see a considerable temperature jump in the main shock followed by further temperature increase in the compression wave from the shock to the flame front .",
    "the compression wave and the shock become stronger as the flame accelerates , until explosion starts and develops into detonation .",
    "recent papers @xcite on ddt in tubes with smooth adiabatic wall have also demonstrated the important role of viscous heating at the wall in addition to shock heating .",
    "because of viscous heating , the temperature at the wall of a smooth adiabatic channel is larger than that at the axis , and numerical modeling demonstrates ddt onsets at the wall .",
    "a similar physical mechanism of viscous heating may also be identified in channels with obstacles , though with proper modifications due to the specific geometry . to elucidate the mechanism , fig .",
    "[ fig-13 ] shows the temperature profiles for @xmath128 along the channel axis , along the wall and at specific obstacle edges .",
    "we can see that on average , temperature is considerably higher at the channel axis .",
    "obstacles reduce the shock strength , which results in much lower average temperature at the obstacle edges , with the lowest temperature at the wall deep in the pockets .",
    "still , obstacles not only moderate the main shock , but they also produce hot spots , which may be crucial in explosion triggering and ddt @xcite . though the average temperature is lower at the obstacle edges , we also observe sharp peaks of temperature ahead of every obstacle , which are much higher than the respective temperature at the channel axis .",
    "there are two possible reasons for these temperature peaks . first",
    ", secondary shock waves reflected from the obstacles may produce local temperature increase .",
    "second , the strong jet - flow pushed by an accelerating flame slows down at the obstacles and generates vortices in the pockets with high velocity gradients .",
    "slowdown of the jet flow increases local pressure and temperature .",
    "viscous dissipation of the vortices leads to additional temperature increase , which has the same effect as viscous heating at the wall in smooth tubes @xcite .",
    "the important role of viscous heating in producing temperature peaks is especially obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig-13 ] at the positions @xmath129 , which are ahead of the strong shock position , @xmath130 . at this simulation run explosion starts at an obstacle edge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-14 ] .",
    "it is noted the exact position of explosion triggering may depend on the particular obstacle geometry , e.g. on the spacing between the obstacles . in figs .",
    "[ fig-11 ] , [ fig-14 ] we used a rather small spacing @xmath131 .",
    "other simulations @xcite performed for larger spacings also demonstrated the possibility of explosion triggering deep in the pockets with the hot spots produced by reflected shocks .",
    "thus , both in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present simulation , obstacles play an important role in explosion triggering and ddt .",
    "this paper presents the theory and numerical simulation of flame acceleration in channels with obstacles .",
    "we showed theoretically as well as computationally that flame acceleration is noticeably stronger in the axisymmetric geometry as compared to the planar one .",
    "we also considered the influence of gas compression on the flame acceleration , and showed numerically that the flame acceleration rate decreases with increasing initial mach number , and that the velocity of the accelerating flame eventually saturates to a value that is supersonic with respect to the wall and is correlated to the known cj deflagration speed .",
