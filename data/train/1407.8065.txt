    "such quantum enhancement of precision has been experimentally achieved in several quantum systems like quantum optics @xcite , ions @xcite , and atoms @xcite .",

    "a linear approximation is used in the derivation of the lu , while many estimation methods used in quantum metrology like a maximum - likelihood estimator are nonlinear functions of data , and the nonlinearity is not negligible for finite data .",

    "we assume that the measurement outcomes are bounded , i.e. , @xmath17 .",

    "it might seem natural to consider a direct inversion estimator , @xmath35 .",
    "in general , however , the direct inversion estimator does not work well , because the sample mean is a random variable and can be out of @xmath26 , which is caused by a statistical fluctuation originated from the finiteness of @xmath12 .",
    "the inverse function @xmath36 may not exist outside @xmath26 , and we may not be able to calculate @xmath37 there . even if @xmath38 exists , @xmath37 can be out of @xmath39 .",
    "one solution to avoid this problem of @xmath40 mentioned above is a maximum - likelihood estimator ( mle ) , @xmath41 . unlike @xmath42 ,",
    "an estimate of the mle always exists and takes a value in @xmath39 .",
    "the mle has good statistical properties , for example , it attains the cramr - rao bound in the limit of @xmath12 going to infinity @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic ( @xmath43 ) behavior of the mle is well known in classical statistics @xcite , but a rigorous analysis for finite @xmath12 is an open problem . instead of the mle , we consider a different estimator relatively easier to be analyzed .",
    "let us choose an estimator @xmath15 .",
    "the estimates @xmath44 depend on data and probabilistically fluctuate .",
    "this means that we can observe estimates deviated from the true parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this difference is called an estimation error of the estimator .",
    "to evaluate an estimation error is an important topic in quantum metrology .",
    "as explained in sec [ sec : introduction ] , the most popular benchmark is the root mean squared error ( rmse ) , which is defined as @xmath45}.     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] generally speaking , a direct analysis of the rmse itself is difficult , since the rmse is a function of the dynamics @xmath7 and our choice of the initial state @xmath6 , measurement @xmath21 , and estimator @xmath15 .",
    "there are two approaches to reduce the degree of this difficulty for analyzing the rmse .",
    "the first approach is to approximate the rmse for the di estimator .",
    "when the number of repetition @xmath12 is sufficiently large , we can approximate the rmse of the di estimator as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47}}{\\left| \\frac{d}{d\\phi } { \\mathbbm{e}}[\\bm{\\pi } | \\rho_{\\phi } ] \\right|}.             \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this approximation , the nonlinearity of the di estimator is ignored .",
    "in other words , the r.h.s . of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx_lu ] ) is the rmse of the linearized di estimator , and it is called the linearized uncertainty ( lu ) .",
    "the details of this approximation are given in appendix [ sec : lu ] .",
    "an advantage of the lu is that the analysis is easy , because it consists of the variance and derivative of expectation with respect to a single outcome .",
    "estimates of @xmath48 such as @xmath49}}{\\left| \\frac{d}{d\\phi } { \\mathbbm{e}}[\\bm{\\pi } | .",
    "\\rho_{\\phi } ] \\right| } \\right|_{\\phi = \\phi^{\\mathrm{di}}_{n}(\\bm{x}^{n } ) } \\label{eq : estimate_lu }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are calculated in some experiments @xcite .",
    "the second approach is to analyze an asymptotic lower bound of the rmse , which is independent of our choice of estimator .",
    "let us introduce two classes of estimators in statistical estimation theory .",
    "when the expectation of an estimator with respect to @xmath12 equals to the true parameter , the estimator is called unbiased for @xmath12 .",
    "when the derivative of the expectation converges to one in the limit of @xmath12 going to the infinity , the estimator is called asymptotically unbiased . for any unbiased estimator with respect to @xmath12 , the following inequality holds under certain normal conditions",
    "@xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are quantities called the classical and quantum fisher information , respectively .",
    "( [ eq : ccrb ] ) and ( [ eq : qcrb ] ) are called the classical and quantum cramr - rao inequality for finite @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "most of estimators in quantum metrology , which include di an mle , are biased for finite @xmath12 , which is originated from the nonlinear parametrization of probability distributions .",
    "this means that the cramr - rao inequalities for finite @xmath12 is not applicable for quantum metrology",
    ". however , most of  natural \" estimators in quantum metrology , which includes di and mle again , are asymptotically unbiased . for any asymptotically unbiased estimator",
    ", the following inequality holds under certain normal conditions @xcite : @xmath53 where eqs .",
    "( [ eq : asymptoticccrb ] ) and ( [ eq : asymptoticqcrb ] ) are called classical and quantum cramr - rao inequalities for asymptotic @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the mle attains the classical cramer - rao bound ( crb ) for asymptotic @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the crbs is their generality for our choice of estimator and measurement .",
    "the classical crb is independent of estimators , and the quantum crb is independent of measurement .",
    "so , classical and quantum crbs are used for evaluating ultimate performances of a combination of @xmath6 and @xmath21 or @xmath6 , respectively .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "lu and crbs are interesting and important quantities .",
    "however , they are not suitable for rigorously evaluating an estimation error in experiments with finite @xmath12 because of the following two reasons .",
    "( 1 ) lu and crbs are functions of the unknown parameter @xmath4 , and we can not know their exact values in experiments . of course , we can estimate their values by calculating quantities like eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimate_lu ] ) , but the calculated values are estimates that can be different from the exact value .",
    "( 2 ) lu and crbs are not valid for finite @xmath12 as explained in this subsection .",
    "when @xmath12 is sufficiently large , we may be able to validate the use of them , but it is unclear which @xmath12 can be interpreted as sufficiently large . in order to rigorously evaluate an estimation error for finite @xmath12 , we need another benchmark .",
    "roughly speaking , confidence intervals are intervals including the true parameter with high probability .",
    "we propose the size of an confidence interval as a new benchmark in quantum metrology .",
    "when an interval @xmath54 is a function of data and is independent of @xmath4 , the function is called an interval estimator .",
    "we would like to find an interval estimator such that the interval estimates @xmath55 include @xmath4 with high probability .",
    "when @xmath56 holds with probability at least @xmath57 for any @xmath25 , the interval estimator is called a confidence interval with ( @xmath57)-confidence level .",
    "for example , @xmath58 is a confidence interval with @xmath59-confidence level .",
    "this example is trivial and useless .",
    "we need a nontrivial and useful confidence interval .",
    "the following two properties are required for a  nontrivial \" and  useful \" confidence interval in quantum metrology experiments .    1 .",
    "its size converges to zero in the limit of @xmath12 going to infinity .",
    "2 .   its size can show a quantum enhancement when we use a quantum resource in quantum metrology experiments .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a new confidence interval and prove that it has two properties mentioned above .    before moving on to our results ,",
    "let us note their difference from known results .",
    "confidence interval and confidence level are well known concepts in classical statistics , and there are many statistical techniques to calculate them for finite data @xcite .",
    "most of these techniques are , however , based on the normal distribution approximation ( nda ) , and a confidence interval calculated with the nda is called an approximate confidence interval .",
    "the nda is valid when the number of measurement trials @xmath12 is sufficiently large ( the central limit theorem ) , but again , it is not clear which @xmath12 can be considered as sufficiently large . therefore , it is not rigorous to apply approximate confidence intervals for finite data in experiments .",
    "in contrast to an approximate confidence interval , a confidence interval calculated without any assumption on probability distribution is called an exact confidence interval .",
    "our new confidence interval is an exact confidence interval , and to the best of our knowledge , it is the first exact confidence interval for quantum metrology .",
    "an exact confidence region , which is a generalization of confidence interval to higher dimensional spaces , for quantum tomography was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the estimation object in quantum tomography is quantum state , process , or measurement , which includes multi parameters .",
    "some readers might think that the result in @xcite would be applicable for quantum metrology because quantum metrology is an estimation problem of quantum process with single parameter , but this is not correct .",
    "quantum process tomography and quantum metrology are different problems from statistical viewpoints , and the result for quantum tomography obtained in @xcite is not applicable for quantum metrology . the main difference is from the difference of their parametrization of probability distribution . in quantum tomography , the probability distribution of measurement outcome can be linearly parametrized by the estimation object . in quantum metrology , on the other hands , the estimation object is single parameter , but the parametrization of probability distribution is nonlinear . in general , statistical estimation problems with linearly parametrized and nonlinearly parametrized probability distributions have different statistical properties .",
    "for example , the classical crb for finite data is attainable in the linear case , but it is not attainable in the nonlinear case @xcite . actually , in quantum tomography , there exists an unbiased estimator that attains the equality of the classical cramer - rao inequality for any finite data , but in quantum metrology , there do not exist any unbiased estimators that attain the equality for finite data .",
    "this is caused from the difference of their parametrizations .",
    "therefore quantum process tomography and quantum metrology are different problems in statistical estimation .",
    "additionally , the linearity of the parametrization in quantum tomography is used in the derivation of the exact confidence region in @xcite , and the result is not applicable for quantum metrology . in order to derive an exact confidence interval that reflects quantumness of resources in quantum metrology , we need new mathematical techniques .",
    "we consider the least squares ( ls ) estimator , @xmath60 same as the mle , the ls estimates @xmath61 always exist and take values in @xmath39 .",
    "let us define @xmath62 note that @xmath63 is the unbiased sample variance of the data and satisfies @xmath64 = { \\mathbbm{v}}\\left [ \\bm{\\pi } | \\rho_{\\phi } \\right]$ ] . using the quantities introduced above , we define three functions of data @xmath30 and an user - specified constant @xmath65.@xmath66 the following theorem guarantees that the deviation of the ls estimates from the true parameter is upper bounded by @xmath67 with high probability .",
    "[ theorem : exactconfidenceinterval ] for any number of measurement trials @xmath68 , user - specified constant @xmath69 , and true parameter @xmath25 , @xmath70 holds with probability at least @xmath71 .",

    ", @xmath73 holds with high probability @xmath57 , where we choose the value of @xmath65 as small as we like . the @xmath74 becomes larger as we choose smaller @xmath65 .",
    "this means that , if we require a higher confidence level for a fixed @xmath12 , the  error bar \" becomes larger for safe .",
    "if we want to keep the confidence level , we need to increase the number of measurement .",
    "we sketch the proof of theorem 1 , with the details shown in the appendix [ sec : prooftheorem1 ] .",
    "the ls estimator is a nonlinear function of the sample mean , which is the origin of the main difficulty for the analysis .",
    "we use the taylor expansion up to the second order with the remainder , and reduce the problem to an analysis on the deviation of the sample mean from the true expectation , @xmath75 . in the reduction , we use the contractivity of the ls estimator , i.e. , @xmath76 the contractivity is one of the two main keys in this proof , and this is the reason why we choose the ls estimator . after the reduction",
    ", we use two inequalities for evaluating @xmath75 .",
    "one is hoeffding s inequality @xcite , which is well known in classical statistics .",
    "the other is the empirical bernstein inequality @xcite , which is a new mathematical tool developed for finite data analysis in machine learning .",
    "the empirical bernstein inequality is the second key in this proof .",
    "it enables us to show a relation to the linearized uncertainty explained later . by combining these inequalities , contractivity , and taylor expansion , we obtain theorem 1 .",
