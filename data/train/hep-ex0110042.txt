    "it can be expressed in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath12 by @xmath32 , where @xmath31 is the negative four momentum vector squared of the quark entering the _ i_-subprocess and @xmath12 is a variable describing this process in analogy to the bjorken scaling variable @xmath0 in dis .",
    "the instanton cross section can be safely calculated @xcite in `` instanton perturbation theory '' only for large values of @xmath31 and @xmath12 . towards lower values the cross section calculated perturbatively steeply increases .",
    "matching the instanton size and distance distributions in the qcd vacuum , which are fundamental properties of instantons , to high quality lattice calculations allows to derive lower boundaries @xmath33 , @xmath34 above which the perturbative calculations are applicable .",
    "the most recent calculations of the cross section for _ i_-induced events at the hera collider requires an additional cut on @xmath35 to further reduce theoretical uncertainties due to non - planar diagrams , which are not present in the calculation . in the kinematic region defined by the cuts required by the perturbative ansatz @xmath34 , @xmath36 and general additional cuts @xmath37 and @xmath38 the cross section at hera is @xmath39 @xcite .",

    "both generators incorporate the @xmath46 matrix elements .",
    "the main difference is the treatment of gluon emission where rapgap implements the parton shower approach @xcite while ariadne employs the colour dipole model @xcite .",
    "we will therefore refer to rapgap as `` meps '' and ariadne as `` cdm '' in the following .",
    "the data were collected in the year 1997 when the hera machine collided @xmath47 positrons with @xmath48 protons . the accumulated data sample recorded with the h1 detector amounted to an integrated luminosity of @xmath49 .",
    "a detailed description of the h1 detector can be found in @xcite .",
    "a scematic view of a simulated qcdins event in the h1 detector is given in figure  [ fig : detector ] .",
    "for this analysis the important detector components are the backward spacal calorimeter which is necessary for the measurement of the scattered positron and the liquid argon ( lar ) calorimeter which together with the tracking system measures the particles in the _ i_-band and the current jet . because the positron is only identified using the backward spacal calorimeter polar angles are limited to @xmath50 which restricts the analysis to values of @xmath51 .",
    "the most characteristic feature of _ i_-induced events is the densely populated band of hadrons in the laboratory frame due to the isotropic decay of the instanton in its rest system .",
    "therefore the measurement of the energy flow of the hadronic final state is crucial to the identification of _ i_-induced events .",
    "the energy flow in the detector is reconstructed combining the calorimetric energy depositions in the lar and spacal calorimeters with the momenta of low momentum tracks ( @xmath52 ) in the central jet chamber according to the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "also the second striking feature of _ i_-induced events , the current jet , relies on this measurement .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "the most interesting observables characteristic to _ i_-induced events are @xmath12 and @xmath31 since they are linked to the instanton size and distance which show a characteristic behaviour . therefore reconstructing these kinematic variables of",
    "the _ i_-subprocess from the hadronic final state is paramount to identifying",
    "_ i_-induced events .",
    "the starting point of the reconstruction of the underlying kinematics can either be finding the current jet or reconstructing the expected band of hadrons in the detector .",
    "both ways have been intensively studied @xcite and a preference to identifying the band first was given .",
    "the first step is to reconstruct the mean pseudo - rapidity @xmath53 of the band by finding the @xmath54 weighted mean @xmath26 of the calorimeter clusters @xmath55 and define the band by @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this spread of 1.1 rapidity units of the band is expected from basic theoretical considerations .",
    "the second step is to find the current jet which has roughly an @xmath54 of @xmath57 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : varslog ] .",
    "using the cone jet algorithm with a cone radius of @xmath58 allows to identify the jet in about 70% of the cases .",
    "the reason for the relatively small cone size is the fact that the correct current jet can also be directed into the _ i_-band and thus a bigger cone radius is prone to pick up more energy from the band while the cone size is still sufficient to find jets and reconstruct their kinematics reliably when they are well separated from the band .",
    "if the jet is emitted into the same @xmath26 and @xmath59 region as the band , then the clusters belonging to the jet are removed from the band .",
    "after the reconstruction of the jet @xmath31 can be calculated and assuming the invariant mass of the band to be the mass @xmath60 of the instanton allows to derive @xmath12 ( see figure  [ fig : kine ] ) .    the tagged band can now also be exploited to calculate properties that should be characteristic to the particles produced by an instanton transition .",
    "that is a high isotropy of the outgoing particles , a high number of charged particles which can be seen in the tracking system of the detector and possibly an increased strangeness production .    , the sphericity @xmath61 and the reconstructed virtuality of the quark entering the _ i_-subprocess @xmath62 .",
    "the lines and the associated arrows denote the cuts applied . ]    for this analysis the following three variables have been chosen to characterize the _",
    "i_-induced events : the reconstructed virtuality of the quark entering the _",
    "i_-subprocess @xmath62 , the number of charged particles in the @xmath26-region of the band @xmath63 and the sphericity of all particles except those belonging to the jet , calculated in their centre of mass frame .",
    "these variables are shown in figure  [ fig : dvarshape ] . because of their potential in discriminating _",
    "i_-induced events from background and due to the good description of the data prior to any cuts these variables are used in a cut procedure to enhance the _",
    "i_-signal over the dis signal .",
    "the distributions are generally described within 5% by the standard dis monte carlo programs except for the tails which are only described within 10% ( for the highest multiplicities up to 20% ) .",
    "three additional observables have been chosen which are used to monitor the remaining events after the cuts and to see whether they support the _ i_-hypothesis after after discriminating against the dis background .",
    "the variables are the total transverse energy of the band @xmath64 , the isotropy variable @xmath65 described below and calculated for the band and the transverse energy of the jet @xmath66 .",
    "these variables are described not as well as the first three , but still the description differs by about only 10% .",
    "the isotropy variable of the band @xmath67 is defined using the quantities @xmath68 where @xmath69 will be small for a non - isotropic set of hadrons since then there is a direction @xmath70 onto which the projections of the hadron momenta @xmath71 is small and @xmath72 will be large for the same set of non - isotropically distributed hadrons .",

    "in order to reduce the standard dis background , several different combinations of cuts into the three observables @xmath62 , @xmath75 and @xmath63 are studied and evaluated for their ability to separate _",
    "i_-induced events from the background by achieving a high separation power @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the fraction of events left after the cuts .",
    "125 different scenarios where surveyed which represent all possible combinations of five different values at which to cut into the three observables .",
    "the following cuts are used : @xmath78 , @xmath79 and for @xmath62 : @xmath80 .",
    "three different scenarios were singled out according to the following criteria :    ( a ) : :    the highest instanton efficiency ( @xmath81 ) ( b ) : :    high @xmath81 at reasonable background    reduction ( @xmath82 ) ( c ) : :    highest separation power @xmath83 at    @xmath84    the values of the cuts chosen in the three scenarios as well as the number of events in the data and the two standard dis monte carlo simulators is shown in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the error on the number of mc events includes systematical and statistical uncertainties .",
    "the systematic experimental uncertainties are of an order of 510% and the two available standard dis monte carlo models based on leading order qcd matrix elements and implementing different treatments of higher order parton emissions agree with each other within 20% .",
    "the number of data events is about 20% larger than predicted by the dis models . note that this is about the difference of the prediction of the two monte carlo generators and the background estimation is largely unknown in this extreme phase space region . whether the excess can be explained by instanton induced processes or is simply due to an incomplete implementation of higher order parton emissions or due to another possible deficiency in the description of the dis background , for example , an incorrect treatment of heavy quarks , remains an open question .",
    "looking at the three variables after the cuts of scenario  c ( figure  [ fig : varscut ] ) shows that the three variables which were used in the cut scenario would support the _",
    "i_-hypothesis while especially the distribution of @xmath64 and @xmath85 disfavour it . in both of these distributions data shows a softer behaviour than the dis monte carlo programs while qcdins predicts a harder @xmath86 spectrum .",
    "recent theoretical analysis shows , that this might be due to the lack of a cut in @xmath41 which suppresses the contribution of non - planar graphs in the _ i_-subprocess and which are not implemented in qcdins .",
    "in fact , schrempp and ringwald have shown that it is possible to soften the @xmath86 spectra of the jet and the band while not affecting the other four distributions by a cut against low @xmath87 and thus , by exploiting the strong correlation between @xmath87 and @xmath1 in qcdins and suppressing the contribution of events at low @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it will therefore be definitely interesting to extend the analysis to high @xmath1 where the theoretical uncertainties in particular on these two variables are smaller . in the following section a possible search strategy is presented .",

    "since the expected cross section of _ i_-induced events in the kinematic region ( @xmath88 ) is by approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the dis cross section @xmath89 , it is important to gain the highest possible signal to background ratio .",

    "the number of events in the vicinity of a certain point is a problem known as range searching .",
    "range searching algorithms have been developed which allow a search time @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the number of points that have to be searched @xcite .",
    "an algorithm using binary trees to store the events is employed , suitable especially for a large number of events and dimensions ( i.e. observables ) .",
