    "the large @xmath1 limit , where @xmath1 is the number of colors , is a useful device to understand many systematic features of baryon properties @xcite , such as the @xmath0 scaling of various physical quantities . in a series of papers , dashen and manohar @xcite , and jenkins",
    "@xcite have discussed the @xmath0 structure of baryon properties , and the framework for combining chiral symmetry with the large @xmath1 aspects of qcd has been developed by many authors @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the baryon octet and decuplet mass spectra were discussed in this framework and the baryon mass relations were derived . however , although those works successfully reproduce mass relations at tree level , they do not compute all possible terms allowed by the chiral and large @xmath1 expansions .",
    "the baryon mass spectrum was re - examined in conventional baryon chiral perturbation theory by borasoy and meissner @xcite . to compute the baryon masses to order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the quark mass , the decuplet degrees of freedom are integrated out to give counter terms , and some low - energy constants are determined from resonance saturation . however ,",
    "when we work with the @xmath0 expansion , the octet and decuplet states are degenerate at the leading order , and the decuplet fields must be treated explicitly .    in this paper , we re - examine the baryon masses in chiral perturbation theory taking into account the @xmath0 counting based on the techniques developed in the literature , e.g. , in refs .",
    "this enables us to investigate the @xmath0 structure of the baryon properties and the meson - baryon interactions in a systematic way .",
    "the baryon axial current matrix elements and the strangeness contribution to the nucleon mass are computed as well .",
    "some of these topics were discussed in the literature @xcite focusing on the leading order terms in @xmath0 expansion ( up to one loop corrections ) . in this paper , we perform the calculations to the next orders and discuss a difficulty which arises in computing the one loop corrections in a way which is consistent with the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the formalism of this approach . in section iii , we compute the baryon axial current up to one - loop corrections .",
    "the baryon mass formulas are given in section iv .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the baryon masses are calculated in section v. we discuss the strangeness contribution to the nucleon mass and the sigma term in section vi and then finish with a summary and conclusion in section vii .",
    "explicit expressions of baryon wave functions and some detailed formulas are given in appendices .",
    "we start with a brief review of the construction of baryon states in the large @xmath1 limit , referring to refs.@xcite for further details . the baryon states with @xmath1 quarks can be written as follows : @xmath4 in particle number space , where @xmath5 are the flavor indices , @xmath6 the spin indices and @xmath7 the color indices . the quark creation and annihilation operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 satisfy the usual anti - commutator relations for fermions .",
    "the symmetric tensor @xmath10 is characteristic of each given baryon wave function .",
    "since the baryons are in color - singlet states , however , it is more convenient to work with @xmath11 and @xmath12 are _ bosonic _ operators satisfying the usual commutator relations . for short - hand notation",
    ", we label the quark operators as @xmath13 so that @xmath14 creates @xmath15-quark with spin - up , and so forth .",
    "there is an ambiguity when we extrapolate the physical baryon states to large @xmath1 . as in the literature , we keep the spin , isospin and strangeness of baryons as @xmath16 in the large @xmath1 limit . for example",
    ", the nucleon state in large @xmath1 limit has spin 1/2 , isospin 1/2 and no strangeness .",
    "this can be done by acting with spin - flavor singlet operators on the physical baryon states .",
    "for example , the proton spin - up state can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the normalization constant .",
    "the spin - isospin singlet operator @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 one can easily verify that this state reduces to the usual quark model state in the real world with @xmath22 .",
    "the complete list of the baryon octet and decuplet states can be found in appendix a.    next we define a one - body operator @xmath23 in spin - flavor space as @xmath24 so that its expectation value on baryon states is at most of @xmath25 . in a similar way , one can define 2-body operators @xmath26 and 3-body operators @xmath27 , and so on .",
    "then , it is found that the coefficient of an @xmath28-body operator is at most @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of inner quark loops @xcite .",
    "this enables us to treat the coupling constants as @xmath16 quantities in the large @xmath1 expansion by writing the @xmath1-dependence of the operators explicitly .    by direct evaluation",

    "this means that the order of an operator in @xmath0 counting reduces when we have a commutator structure as in eq .",

    "this plays an important role in the large @xmath1 analyses of the baryon properties",
    ".    we will discuss the explicit forms of some operators which appear in the calculation of baryon axial currents and masses in the next sections .",
    "our starting point is the chiral meson - baryon effective lagrangian .",
    "baryon matrix elements of this lagrangian involve the meson - baryon interaction in the following form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the baryon spin matrix , with the usual pauli matrices @xmath35 . ] and the dots denote higher order terms .",
    "the axial field @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 with the meson decay constant @xmath39 .",
    "the su(3 ) matrix field @xmath40 represents the octet of pseudoscalar goldstone bosons .",
    "it is defined as @xmath41 with the usual gell - mann matrices @xmath42 @xmath43 . in eq .",
    "( [ lag : mb ] ) , the @xmath1 factors of operators are given explicitly , and the coupling constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 are of @xmath16 in the @xmath0 counting",
    ".    then the baryon axial current @xmath46 reads @xmath47 from the lagrangian ( [ lag : mb ] ) with @xmath48 this gives its matrix elements as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dirac spinor of the baryon and @xmath51 at the tree level .    by using the wave functions given in appendix a , we can compute the baryon axial current straightforwardly .",
    "a naive investigation of each term gives that , despite the @xmath0 factor , the @xmath45 term contribution is expected to be of the same order as that coming from the @xmath44 term .",
    "this is because the @xmath45 term contains a 2-body operator whose expectation value can be @xmath32 , thus the leading order of the @xmath45 term contribution can be of @xmath1 .",
    "however , close inspection shows that the @xmath44 term contribution dominates , because the @xmath45 term contains the operator @xmath52 and our baryon wave functions satisfy @xmath53 .",
    "the explicit forms of the relevant operators are @xmath54 so that we obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 these results show that the @xmath45 term contributions are suppressed as compared to those of the @xmath44 terms as we discussed above .",
    "we can also find that the leading order of @xmath57 is @xmath25 , whereas @xmath58 , which changes the baryon strangeness , is @xmath59 .",
    "this shows that the strangeness - changing ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) baryon axial currents are suppressed as compared to the strangeness - conserving ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) baryon axial currents by @xmath59 . this can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ opform1 ] ) by noting that the number of @xmath15,@xmath62 quarks in the baryon wave functions is @xmath25 whereas that of @xmath63 quark , i.e. , strangeness , is @xmath64 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath65 , acting with @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) on the baryon state gives the factor @xmath1 , and the inner product of initial and final baryon wave functions with the proper normalization constants gives @xmath16 , so that @xmath65 is @xmath25 .",
    "however , for @xmath68 , the action with @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) gives @xmath64 because our baryon wave functions have the strangeness of @xmath64 .",
    "since the normalization constants of nucleon and @xmath71 are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , we have an additional factor @xmath74 in the calculation of @xmath68 , which implies that the order of @xmath68 is @xmath59 .",
    "since the contributions of the @xmath45 term are suppressed as compared to those of the @xmath44 term by @xmath75 for the @xmath61 axial currents and by @xmath72 for the @xmath76 axial currents , we can neglect the @xmath45 term up to next to leading order . at this order ,",
    "when we fix @xmath22 , we can recover the quark model relation @xcite , @xmath77 by comparing with the results of the baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite in addition to the quark model predictions @xmath78 for the octet - decuplet - meson and decuplet - decuplet - meson coupling constants , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , defined as in ref .",
    "when we go further in the @xmath0 expansion , we must include the @xmath45 term , and we get the modified relations , @xmath81 as found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also compute @xmath82 by using @xmath83 where we have introduced @xmath84 .",
    "this leads to @xmath85 from these results we find that the leading order of @xmath82 is @xmath64 and that the @xmath45 term provides a leading contribution together with the @xmath44 term .",
    "this is because the expectation values of @xmath86 are @xmath25 whereas those of @xmath87 are @xmath16 .",
    "so we conclude that in order to get a consistent result on @xmath82 , one should consider @xmath88-body ( @xmath89 ) operators in general unless their coupling constants are suppressed . from the fitted values of @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    ", one can estimate @xmath92 together with @xmath93 , which shows that @xmath45 is indeed small , less than 15% of @xmath44 , but with opposite sign @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should keep in mind the contributions from @xmath88-body ( @xmath94 ) operators in the calculation of @xmath95 .",
    "we have a similar situation when we compute the @xmath96-meson loop corrections to the baryon masses in section v.      the one - loop corrections to the baryon axial current in large @xmath1 chiral perturbation theory as shown in fig .",

    "this shows that the meson - baryon coupling is of order @xmath1 .",
    "because of the presence of @xmath101 which scales as @xmath102 , each vertex has a factor @xmath74 . then from fig .",
