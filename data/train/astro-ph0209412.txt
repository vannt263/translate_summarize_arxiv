    "growing evidence connects grbs to the the birth of hyper - accreting black holes @xcite , that is stellar mass black holes accreting matter from a disk at rates from @xmath30.01 to 10 @xmath0 .",
    "such models include the collapsar @xcite , merging neutron stars and black holes @xcite , supranovae @xcite , merging helium cores and black holes @xcite , and merging white dwarfs and black holes @xcite . for such high accretion rates",
    "the disk is optically thick , except to neutrinos , and very hot , consisting in its inner regions of a ( viscous ) mixture of neutrons and protons . at its inner boundary",
    "the disk connects to the black hole .",
    "whatever processes accelerate the putative grb - producing jet might therefore be expected to act upon some mixture of disk material and other background medium ( e.g. , the collapsing star in the collapsar model ) .",
    "farther out , material will be lost from the disk in a vigorous wind @xcite .",
    "in fact , narayan et al .",
    "suggest that _ most _ of the disk will be lost to a wind except for those models and in those regions where neutrino losses dominate the energy budget .",
    "it is thus of some consequence to know the composition of such disks . in the least case ,",
    "the nucleosynthesis may be novel and could account for rare species in nature , such as the @xmath1-process . at most , the presence of free neutrons may affect the dynamics of the grb jet @xcite , the grb neutrino signature @xcite , light curve @xcite , and afterglow ( e.g. via a `` pre - acceleration '' mechanism similar to the one discussed by beloborodov 2002 ) .",
    "it is also of some consequence to know whether the disk wind consists of radioactive @xmath2ni , as is necessary if a visible supernova is to accompany the grb .",
    "if the electron mole number , @xmath4 , is less than 0.485 , the iron group will be dominated by @xmath5fe and other more neutron - rich species @xcite which will be incapable of illuminating the supernova . since the jet itself is inefficient at heating sufficient matter to temperatures required for nuclear statistical equilibrium ( t @xmath6 k ) ,",
    "supernovae seen in conjunction with grbs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) would be difficult to understand .",
    "we have thus undertaken a survey of the nucleosynthesis that happens in the disks of rapidly accreting black holes .",
    "the work is greatly facilitated by the existence of numerical and semi - analytic solutions that yield the temperature - density structure and drift velocity @xcite .",
    "these solutions have been verified in the case of the collapsar model by direct numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "for a disk that is optically thin to neutrinos the neutron to proton ratio , @xmath7 , is determined by the competition between electron and positron capture on nuclei and free nucleons .",
    "since the baryon number per co - moving volume is conserved , it is convenient to work with the electron fraction @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the proton number , mass fraction , and atomic mass number ( integer ) of the species @xmath13 .",
    "we shall refer to compositions with @xmath14 0.5 as `` neutron - rich '' .",
    "if we neglect lepton capture on bound nuclei and approximate the disk material as consisting of a mixture of free nucleons and @xmath15-particles , the evolution of @xmath8 with radius is given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the mass fraction of free nucleons , @xmath18 is the 4-velocity of the flow , @xmath19 represents the black hole mass , and @xmath20 is the radial drift velocity as measured in an inertial frame co - rotating with the disk . in the middle term in eq .",
    "[ yedot ] we have assumed steady state conditions as well as cylindrical symmetry , and we have adopted the relatively simple schwarzschild metric relevant for most of our calculations . generally , relativistic effects do not make a big difference in our calculations of the electron fraction , though they are important for determing the structure of the disk .    in eq .",

    "the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the electron and positron distribution functions , while the @xmath30 are the coulomb wave correction factors discussed in @xcite .",
    "the electron fermi energy @xmath31 is found by inverting the expression for the net electron number density ,    @xmath32    with @xmath33 .",
    "we solve for the evolution of @xmath8 by integrating eq .",
    "[ yedot ] for the results presented in @xcite .",
    "those authors assumed @xmath34 . because we will show that in some cases @xmath35 , and consequently that the electron fermi energy and degeneracy pressure are substantially smaller than for @xmath34 , our results are not entirely self consistent , but should suffice given the very approximate nature of a one - dimensional calculation .",
    "we present results for several different disk models .",
    "the parameters describing these models , as well as the electron fraction near the event horizon at @xmath36 , are given in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "in all cases we assume @xmath34 at large radii . for simplicity",
    "we have adopted a constant black hole mass of 3 @xmath37 though the scaling relations for mass are obvious in popham et al .",
    "all else being equal , a larger mass will give less electron capture .    table",
    "[ tbl1 ] shows a clear trend with disk viscosity and accretion rate : electron capture in the inner disk becomes more pronounced with decreasing viscosity and increasing mass accretion rate .",
    "this arises because low viscosity flows inefficiently advect angular momentum outwards and are , for a given mass accretion rate , denser than high viscosity flows .",
    "dense flows are electron degenerate , so that pair @xmath38 creation is suppressed and electron capture dominates over positron capture .",
    "similarly a larger accretion rate also implies a denser disk - for a given value of @xmath15 - and more capture .    before discussing in some detail the evolution of @xmath8 in our calculations",
    "we note that the influence of black hole spin on the composition is also important .",
    "this is because the angular momemtum imparted to the black hole via the accreting matter will typically drive the kerr parameter high . for example , a kerr parameter of @xmath39 is typical for collapsars .",
    "a larger kerr parameter allows the disk to move to smaller radii before entering the event horizon , so that more electron capture and a smaller @xmath8 will result .",
    "this is demonstrated by model g , which corresponds to a black hole with @xmath40 . in this model @xmath7",
    "near the event horizon is about ten times larger than @xmath7 for the same model except with @xmath41 ( model b ) .",
    "the influence of the black hole spin on @xmath8 is limited to regions quite near the event horizon . for @xmath42 , @xmath8 in model",
    "b is essentially the same as in model g. these considerations imply that as far as the composition is concerned , the main difference between flows around zero angular momentum holes and those around large angular momentum holes will be that the jet in the large angular momentum case will likely be more neutron rich .",
    "the composition in the bulk of the wind coming from the disk , however , will likely be similar in the two cases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.m.01.alpha.1 ] we show the evolution of @xmath8 with radius for an accretion disk with @xmath43 and a relatively low mass accretion rate ( at least for standard collapsar models ) , @xmath44 .",
    "this flow is not dense enough to drive the electrons degenerate .",
    "consequently @xmath8 is governed by thermal @xmath38 capture . in this case",
    "the only asymmetry is the neutron - proton mass difference and @xmath8 actually increases slightly owing to the threshold for the rate in eq .",

    "[ fig.m1.alpha.1 ] .",
    "the material at radii @xmath46 is mildly degenerate and the electron fraction is driven to @xmath47 .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 is the product of the electron capture rate and a rough measure of the dynamic timescale , or time left before the infalling material crosses the event horizon .",
    "because @xmath8 can not come to equilibrium unless @xmath49 , @xmath8 is not in equilibrium in this flow .",
    "also , because @xmath50 when bound nuclei are present , weak processes on heavy nuclei are not important even in the extreme limit where the bound nucleons behave as free nucleons with respect to electron capture .",
    "figures [ fig.m.1.alpha.03 ] and [ fig.m.1.alpha.01 ] show the influence of viscosity on the composition of the flow . for @xmath51 electron capture",
    "becomes important at @xmath52 and @xmath8 is in close equilibrium with @xmath38 capture until @xmath53 .",
    "there is at most @xmath54 of an electron capture per bound nucleus in the disk . for @xmath55",
    "the inflowing material becomes degenerate and neutron rich early on .",
    "most of the free protons are locked into @xmath15-particles until the @xmath15-particles dissociate .",
    "positron capture on the excess free neutrons results in a brief _ increase _ in @xmath8 , as seen in the bump at @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig.m.1.alpha.1 ] .",
    "the final @xmath7 in this disk is very large , @xmath57 .",
    "the influence of the mass accretion rate on the composition is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.m1.alpha.1 ] , where we plot results for @xmath58 and @xmath43 .",
    "this disk is quite similar to the @xmath59 , @xmath60 case .",
    "indeed , this is just what is expected from the scaling relations in @xcite . for @xmath61 and larger , the assumption that the disk is optically thin to neutrinos begins to break down @xcite .",
    "this influences both the structure of the disk , and , because neutrino capture becomes important , the evolution of @xmath8 .",
    "because neutrino trapping likely influences the structure of the disk at the same level as the assumption that @xmath62 , we do not calculate @xmath8 for disks calculated under the assumption of partial neutrino trapping ( and @xmath62 ) .      the effect of neutrino capture on the evolution of @xmath8 can be addressed in an approximate way . in particular , we are interested in the rate @xmath63 for the process @xmath64 the rate for @xmath65 capture is suppressed both because of the low proton number density and the absence of high energy positrons in the flow . the number of neutrinos captured per neutron is roughly @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the optical depth for the process in eq .",
    "[ nuen ] , and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is the number of electron neutrinos produced per neutron ( proton ) in the flow .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 of the number of neutrino captures per neutron to the number of electron captures per proton is @xmath71 this equation implies that an optical depth of 1 to @xmath72 capture is roughly equivalent to a doubling of @xmath73 .",
    "we note here that while the the @xmath72 s produced in electron - capture reactions are not thermal , their average capture cross section is only approximately a factor of 2 higher than the average capture cross section calculated under the assumption of a thermal distribution for the electron neutrinos ( at the electron fermi energy and temperature ) for conditions of interest in accretion disks .",
    "it is difficult to quantitatively calculate the influence of neutrino capture on @xmath8 in a post - processing step .",
    "this is both because of the complexities of neutrino transport , as well as because of the feedback between @xmath8 , the electron capture rate , and the disk dynamics .",
    "however , the following simple considerations argue that neutrino capture is unlikely to have a dramatic influence on @xmath8 .    to discuss some specific cases , consider first the @xmath74 , @xmath43 disk .",
    "@xcite argue that neutrinos will have an absorptive optical depth of unity at @xmath75 for this disk . because weak processes have essentially frozen out by this radius ( see the @xmath76 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig.m.1.alpha.1 ] ) , neutrino capture will have a small influence on @xmath8 .",
    "denser flows trap neutrinos more efficiently but are still expected to remain neutron rich .",
    "for example , for the @xmath77 , @xmath43 disk , @xcite show that the neutrino absorptive optical depth will be greater than unity for @xmath78 . as weak processes are rapid compared to the dynamic timescale in this disk",
    ", the result will be an increase in @xmath8 . to estimate the magnitude of this increase we adopt the simple procedure of artificially increasing the positron capture rate , @xmath79 , which is likely an overestimate of the protonization rate .",
    "the increase in @xmath73results in an electron fraction of @xmath80 near the event horizon . this is approximately 50% higher than the electron fraction calculated by neglecting the influence of @xmath72 capture , though still quite neutron rich .    to summarize , @xmath8 in disks with high viscosity and modest accretion rates",
    "will not be affected by neutrino capture simply because neutrinos are not trapped or because weak processes are too slow . the electron fraction in disks with neutrino absorptive optical depths of",
    "a few will increase somewhat but will remain neutron rich owing to the sharp rise in @xmath81 with @xmath8 .      in order for a low electron fraction to have observable implications",
    "the electron fraction must not come to equilibrium at @xmath34 as the material travels out of the plane of the disk . to estimate the evolution of the electron fraction in convective blobs moving out of the disk we parametrize the convective timescale by the turbulent convection speed @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this implies a time to go one pressure scale height @xmath85 we also assume that the convective blob expands adiabatically .",
    "an estimate for the entropy per baryon in the disk is given by @xcite : @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the temperature in mev and @xmath88 is the density in units of @xmath89 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ entropy ] is the contribution to the entropy from relativistic light particles ( @xmath90 ) , while the next two represent the contribution from free nucleons .",
    "[ entropy ] is not appropriate when electrons are degenerate . for degenerate electrons",
    "the contribution of thermal @xmath38 pairs is small and the coefficient 0.052 should be closer to 0.02 , representing just the entropy of the photons .",
    "however , changing the coefficient to 0.02 makes little difference for our purposes .",
    "when relativistic particles dominate the entropy , the adiabat satisfies @xmath91 .",
    "when free nucleons dominate the entropy , the adiabat satisfies @xmath92 .",
    "the evolution of the electron fraction in a convective blob is crucially sensitive to the adiabat on which the blob travels .    to illustrate this ,",
    "consider first a disk with @xmath93 , @xmath43 .",
    "in fig . [ blob1 ] we show the evolution of the electron fraction in matter originating from two different points in this disk and for different assumptions about @xmath94 .",
    "the upper curves in fig .",
    "[ blob1 ] correspond to material originating from @xmath95 in the disk . at this point",
    "the entropy is relatively high , @xmath96 by the estimate in eq .",
    "[ entropy ] , and consequently the adiabat is closer to @xmath91 than to @xmath92",
    ". the temperature decreases quite slowly relative to the density , allowing for the formation of pairs which efficiently drive @xmath7 to equality . for large @xmath94",
    "this process occurs more efficiently than for small @xmath94 . the lower curves in fig .",
    "[ blob1 ] correspond to matter originating from @xmath97 in the disk . at this point",
    "the entropy is @xmath98 , so the adiabat is near @xmath99 . for low entropies ,",
    "then , the temperature and density decrease at a comparable rate and pair formation is somewhat suppressed , keeping @xmath8 low .    for flows where the electron fraction is high enough to drive the inner disk neutron rich , the entropy is generally dominated by non - relativistic particles , and",
    "the adiabat again preserves a low @xmath8 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ blob2 ] where we plot the evolution of electron fraction in an adiabatic convective bubble for two different disks characterized by a low @xmath8 . in this figure",
    "we only show the evolution of a fluid element from a single initial radius ( @xmath100 ) because the entropy in these is disks never dominated by relativistic particles when @xmath8 is low , so that the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ blob2 ] is generic .",
    "the above considerations outline the general features of how @xmath8 evolves in material as it travels from the center to the surface of the disk . in flows",
    "where @xmath8 is driven small , the degeneracy of the electrons implies that free nucleons dominate the entropy .",
    "a low @xmath8 then , will remain low .",
    "by contrast , in flows where @xmath8 is close to 1/2 , the adiabat can be close enough to @xmath91 for @xmath8 to be driven to 1/2 , and the neutron excess at the center of the disk is larger than the neutron excess in material finding its way out of the disk .",
    "the most obvious consequence of our calculations is that @xmath2ni will be absent from the winds of hyper - accreting black holes unless a ) the accretion rate is low ( @xmath101 ) , and b ) the disk viscosity is high , @xmath102 .",
    "interestingly , modern views regarding @xmath15-disks and grb models favor values close to these .    typical accretion rates in the collapsar model are 0.05 - 0.1 @xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figures 5 and 10 )",
    ". the neutron excess will be smaller in type ii collapsars powered by fall back rather than direct black hole formation @xcite .",
    "considerable accretion into the hole and mass loss from the disk may continue , at a declining rate , even after the main grb producing event ( @xmath320 s ) is over @xcite .",
    "it thus seems likely that the collapsar model will be able to provide the @xmath2ni necessary to make the supernovae that accompany grbs ( though only if @xmath102 ) .",
    "this is also true of the slower accreting models like helium - star black hole mergers and black hole white dwarf mergers .",
    "however any wind from merging compact objects , or similar models like the supranova , will be neutron rich .",
    "though perhaps of interest for nucleosynthesis , they will not produce @xmath2ni , at least during the black hole accretion epoch .      for disks with high accretion rates , and certainly for merging neutron stars or black hole neutron star mergers ,",
    "the matter near the event horizon will be very neutron rich .",
    "if this material pollutes the outgoing jet , the the grb jet will itself , at least initially , contain free neutrons .",
    "the dynamics of accelerating neutron - rich jets can differ dramatically from the dynamics of pure proton jets .",
    "@xcite showed that a high lorentz factor fireball that is neutron rich can lead to two very distinct kinematic components , a slow neutron outflow and a fast proton outflow .",
    "this arises because the uncharged neutrons are weakly coupled to the radiation dominated plasma , and are accelerated principally via strong neutron - proton scatterings @xcite .",
    "strong scatterings freeze out when they become slow compared to the dynamic timescale and at this point the neutrons coast .",
    "if this decoupling occurs while the jet is still accelerating , then the coulomb - coupled protons go on to have a larger lorentz factor than the neutrons .",
    "roughly , dynamic neutron decoupling is only expected for fast jets . here",
    "the precise meaning of `` fast '' depends , among other things , the fireball source size . for relativistic flows originating from compact objects , the dynamic timescale characterizing",
    "the acceleration of the flow is about 1 ms and the final lorentz factor must be greater than @xmath103 in order for dynamic neutron decoupling to occur . for jets in the collapsar model ,",
    "the timescale characterizing the acceleration is set by the surface of last interaction of the jet with the stellar envelope at @xmath104 . in this case",
    "the final lorentz factor of the jet has to be @xmath105 for dynamic neutron decoupling to occur . because this is an impossibly high lorentz factor for the collapsar model",
    ", dynamic neutron decoupling will not occur",
    ".    there may be a detectable neutrino signature of dynamic neutron decoupling .",
    "neutron - proton collisions occurring during decoupling will generate pions . in turn",
    "these pions will decay and lead to the generation of neutrinos with energies of a few gev in our reference frame .",
    "these neutrinos should be detectable at the rate of about one per year in next generation neutrino telescopes @xcite .",
    "in addition , there may also be a direct electromagnetic signature of neutron decoupling .",
    "for some bursts arising from external shocks , a slow decoupled neutron shell will decay and shock with the outer proton shell as the outer shell plows into the interstellar medium .",
    "this leads to a characteristic two - peaked structure in the burst @xcite .",
    "regardless of whether dynamic neutron decoupling occurs , neutrons in the jet may have observable implications for the grb afterglow .",
    "this is particularly true when the shocking radius , i.e. the radius at which the shocks giving rise to the observed @xmath106rays occur , is smaller than the length over which free neutrons decay .",
    "this condition is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the shocking radius , @xmath109 is the lorentz factor of the outflow in units of 100 , and @xmath110 is the free neutron lifetime .",
    "[ nafterglow ] is generally satisfied for bursts from internal shocks and bursts from external shocks in a very dense medium . when eq .",
    "[ nafterglow ] holds , the neutrons can stream ahead of the slowing proton shell ( the complement of the dynamic neutron decoupling discussed above ) and deposit energy as they decay .",
    "implications for the resulting afterglow in such a case have been discussed by @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the r - process in winds and jets from accretion disks .",
    "however , we first note that grb jets are characterized by interesting light element synthesis . @xcite and @xcite calculated the thermal synthesis of light elements in grb - like outflows . they find that the final deuterium mass fraction can be of order 1% , some three orders of magnitude larger than the primordial yield . for kinematically well coupled flows",
    ", the nucleosynthesis depends sensitively on @xmath8 , with deuterium yield decreasing with increasing neutron excess . for flows in which dynamic neutron decoupling occurs , high energy neutron-@xmath15 collisions will spall deuterons and can result in final deuteron mass fractions as high as 10% @xcite .",
    "the jet has the merit of originating in the vicinity of the black hole where the neutron excess is likely to be greatest .",
    "if magnetic fields drive the heating and initial acceleration of the jet , then this neutron excess will likely be preserved .",
    "if neutrinos drive the outflow @xcite , @xmath8 will be reset to some extent by the weak interactions .",
    "however , if the details of the outflow above the black hole are similar to spherically symmetric neutrino driven ultra - relativistic winds , then only @xmath111 annihilation will be important and the flow will remain neutron rich @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the rapid expansion of the jet will be favorable to freezing out with a large abundance of free neutrons and this is conducive to the @xmath1-process @xcite .",
    "however , a pure nucleonic jet coming from the adiabatic expansion of a fireball with energy loading @xmath112 is too much of a good thing when it comes to entropy and rapid expansion .",
    "the entropy was given in eq .",
    "[ entropy ] @xcite @xmath113 the internal energy ( erg / gm ) is @xmath114 and hence , for @xmath115 and @xmath116 2 mev @xmath117    the time scale for the expansion , @xmath118 , is less than a millisecond .",
    "the high entropy implies a low density at the temperature when @xmath119 and @xmath120 can start to recombine .",
    "coupled with the rapid expansion , one might conclude that the jet will remain pure nucleons and light nuclei and that an @xmath1-process is impossible .",
    "this conclusion would be erroneous on several counts .",
    "first , the jet may not always have such high energy loading .",
    "there may be cases where no gamma - ray burst is produced and the energy loading of the jet is much less .",
    "the entropy would then decrease and the expansion time scale would increase . whether to call these `` dirty fireballs '' or simply an extension of the `` disk wind '' is simply a matter of taste ( see below ) .    of more relevance to grb models , and particularly to those that involve massive stars , is that the jet will not escape the star without interaction . along the walls of the jet",
    ", the kelvin helmholtz instability will occur @xcite .",
    "the jet will also encounter one or more shocks where it will be abruptly slowed .",
    "most interesting is the `` jet head '' which moves through the star subrelativistically with a speed that varies but is of order c/3 . at this head",
    "the jet mixes with stellar material and the mixture is swept backwards ( in the moving frame ) forming a cocoon .",
    "it typically takes 5 to 10 sec for the jet head to penetrate the roughly one solar radius of overlying wolf - rayet star in the collapsar model .    during this time , neutrons in the jet are mixed with heavy nuclei - he , o , si , ne , mg and the like - which can serve as seeds for an @xmath1-process . the overall dynamics is likely to be quite complex and its study would requires a multi - dimensional relativistic simulation well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , @xcite find typical densities and time scales in the jet prior to break out are 10@xmath121 to 10@xmath122 g @xmath123 and seconds .",
    "this is enough that many , if not all of the neutrons in the jet would capture .",
    "still , the overall yield in gamma - ray bursts is too small to account for the solar @xmath1-process .",
    "assume there is one grb for each 100 supernovae .",
    "each burst has 10@xmath124 - 10@xmath125 erg of relativistic ejecta ( both jets ) and a lorentz factor that is at least 200 @xcite .",
    "the jet will be some mixture of entrained stellar material and jet , but assume that the initial jet is half or more of the relativistic ejecta .",
    "this gives an equivalent yield of about 10@xmath126 @xmath37 per supernova .",
    "probably the @xmath1-process will be at most 10% of this ( the rest may be @xmath15-particles and entrained nuclei ) .",
    "this then is several orders of magnitude less than required to make the solar r - process .",
    "however , grb jets might still be important sources of the r - process in metal - deficient stars or of select rare nuclei in the sun .",
    "a more significant @xmath1-process could come from the non - relativistic ejecta that comprise the disk wind , provided that the entropy is increased by magnetic processes to well above its value in the middle of the disk , as in for example , @xcite .",
    "assume that the accretion is 50% efficient , that is that half the material that enters the disk eventually enters the black hole and the other half is blown away @xcite .",
    "a typical collapsar powered grb involves the accretion of from one to several solar masses , so @xmath31 @xmath37 is ejected from the disk .",
    "most of this will not be neutron - rich enough or expand fast enough to make the @xmath1-process , but consider the implications if only 1% of the mass that is lost comes from the inner disk at times when the accretion rate is over 0.1 @xmath0 and @xmath127 .",
    "so close to the hole , significant entropy will be added by any acceleration process that produces a strong outflow .",
    "a crude estimate is @xmath128 @xcite , where @xmath129 is the temperature where the energy deposition is the greatest .",
    "in fact the conditions in the inner disk for accretion rates @xmath30.1 @xmath0 are not so different - in terms of neutrino luminosity , neutron excess , temperature , and gravitational potential - from the neutrino - driven wind in an ordinary supernova , and one might expect a similar @xmath1-process @xcite . the gravitational potential though , can in principle , be greater and a larger entropy and shorter time scale might be realized .",
    "assume that the ejecta will be very rich in @xmath15-particles and contain of order 10% @xmath1-process by mass .",
    "putting the numbers together then gives an @xmath1-process synthesis equivalent to 10@xmath130 @xmath37 per supernova , making this possibility well worth further investigation .",

    "<S> for high accretion rates and low viscosity , material arriving at the black hole will consist predominantly of neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> this degree of neutronization will have important implications for the dynamics of the grb producing jet and perhaps for the synthesis of the @xmath1-process . for lower accretion rates and high viscosity , as might be appropriate for the outer disk in the collapsar model </S>",
    "<S> , neutron - proton equality persists allowing the possible synthesis of @xmath2ni in the disk wind . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2ni must be present to make any optically bright type i supernova , and in particular those associated with grbs . </S>"
