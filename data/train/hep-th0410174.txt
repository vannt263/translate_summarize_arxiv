    "in the last few years , dramatic progress has been made in techniques for calculating the partition function of the topological string on toric ( hence non - compact ) calabi - yau manifolds @xcite .",
    "the culmination of this effort has been the formulation of the topological vertex @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent mathematical treatment ) . with it , a set of diagrammatic rules can be formulated which allow an expression for the topological string partition function to be read off from the web diagram of the toric manifold . while the expressions obtained such are algorithmically complete , they contain unwieldy sums over young tableaux , one sum for each internal line of the web diagram .",
    "starting with @xcite , methods were developed to perform a portion of these sums @xcite . in this note",
    ", we show how to perform all sums which arise in an arbitrary smooth triangulation of a strip toric diagram , such as        with arbitrary representations on all external legs but the first and last .",
    "the ultimate goal of this program is to provide a technique for efficiently extracting the gopakumar - vafa invariants from the expressions the topological vertex yields for the topological string partition function .",
    "we will outline the obstacles to this goal using the methods of this paper as we proceed .    as other applications ,",
    "we offer an analysis of the behavior of the topological amplitude under flops of the target manifold .",
    "we demonstrate that the gopakumar - vafa invariants for all toric geometries decomposable into strips are invariant under flops .",
    "we also show that our results provide the framework to check nekrasov s results @xcite in the most general case of product @xmath3 gauge groups with any number of allowed hypermultiplets .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we elucidate the geometries we are considering and present and interpret the rules for obtaining the topological string partition function on them . in section 3 , we derive these results .",
    "we include a brief review of the topological vertex at the beginning of this section , and end it with a comparison to the natural 4-vertex obtained from chern - simons theory .",
    "we discuss the behavior of gopakumar - vafa invariants under flops on geometries decomposable into strips in section 4.1 .",
    "section 4.2 provides the basic building blocks to study nekrasov s conjecture .",
    "we end with conclusions .",
    "an appendix gives a brief introduction to schur functions , and collects the identities for schur functions used throughout the paper .",
    "recall that a simple way of visualizing the geometries given by toric diagrams is to think of them as @xmath4 fibrations over @xmath5 dimensional base manifolds with corners ( see eg . section 4.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "locally , one can introduce complex coordinates on the toric manifold .",
    "the base manifold is then locally given by the absolute value of these coordinates , the @xmath4 by the phases .",
    "the boundary of the base is where some of these coordinates vanish , entailing a degeneration of the corresponding number of fiber directions .    in 3 complex dimensions ,",
    "the 3 real dimensional base has a 2 dimensional boundary with edges and corner .",
    "web diagrams , easily obtained from toric diagrams as sketched in figure [ torictoweb ] , represent the projection of the edges and corners of the base on to the plane .",
    "there is a full @xmath6 fibered over each point above the plane , corresponding to the interior of the base manifold . on a generic point on the plane , representing a generic point on the boundary , one cycle of the fiber degenerates , two degenerate on the lines of the web diagram , which correspond to edges of the base , and the entire fiber degenerates at the vertices of the diagram , the corners of the base .    ]",
    "returning to figure [ torictoweb ] , we now see the string of @xmath0 s ( in red and blue ) emerging by following the @xmath7 fibration along the internal line running through the web diagram .",
    "it is capped off to @xmath0 s by the @xmath7 s degenerating at each vertex .",
    "the two non - compact directions of the geometry locally correspond to the sum over two line bundles over each @xmath0 .",
    "the two local geometries that arise on the strip are @xmath8 ( in red ) and @xmath9 ( in blue ) .",
    "we refer to the respective @xmath0 s as @xmath10 and @xmath11 curves in the following .",
    "each vertex has one non - trivial young tableau associated to it , the two outer vertices in addition have one leg carrying the trivial tableau .",
    "all other indices of the vertices are summed over .",
    "we label the non - trivial tableaux by @xmath12 , with @xmath13 indexing the vertex .",
    "the internal lines carry a factor @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the khler parameter of the curve the internal line represents .",
    "*   each vertex contributes a factor of @xmath16 ( the notation for the argument of the schur function is explained in the next section ) . *",
    "each pair of vertices ( not just adjacent ones ) contributes a factor to the amplitude , which is a pairing of the non - trivial tableaux carried by the pair .",
    "the interpretation of this observation is that branes wrapping the curves consisting of touching @xmath0 s in the web diagram contribute to the gopakumar - vafa index just as those wrapping the individual @xmath0 s .",
    "* while the pairing itself is symmetric , for the purpose of book keeping , we will choose one of the two natural orderings of the vertices along the string of @xmath0 s .",
    "we will speak of the first or second slot of the pairing with reference to this ordering . to determine the pairing factor , note that two types of curves occur on the strip : @xmath10 curves and @xmath11 curves . up to @xmath17 transformations , these are represented by the toric / web diagrams depicted in figure [ twogoodlinks ] .",
    "+ the contribution of the pairing to the amplitude depends essentially on whether an even or odd number of @xmath11 curves lie between the two vertices .",
    "the geometric interpretation of this fact is that the curves consisting of touching @xmath0 s in the web diagram have normal bundle @xmath18 or @xmath19 , depending on whether the string of @xmath0 s contains an even or odd number of smooth @xmath11 curves .",
    "this is suggested both by the toric diagram and by the expressions for the two pairings , as we will see next .",
    "* we denote the two types of pairings between vertices carrying the young tableaux @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath22 and @xmath23=\\{\\alpha \\beta\\}^{-1}$ ] ( we use the notation @xmath24 $ ] when we make statements valid for both types of pairing ) .",

    "note that , as advertised above , if we take the two young tableaux to be trivial , the contribution from the pairing @xmath30 is exactly that of a @xmath11 curve , and likewise , the contribution of @xmath31=\\{\\cdot \\cdot\\}^{-1}$ ] is that of a @xmath10 curve . * to keep track of the contribution from two paired vertices , we can divide the vertices into two relative types , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , such that the type of a vertex depends on that of the preceding vertex : two vertices connected by a @xmath10 curve are of same type , two connected by a @xmath11 curve of opposite type .",
    "if the vertices @xmath13 and @xmath34 are of same type ( i.e. have an even number of @xmath11 curves between them ) , the pairing factor is @xmath35 $ ] , else @xmath36^{-1 } $ ] .",

    ", we anchor the relative types @xmath32 and @xmath33 as follows : we will take the first vertex of the string of @xmath0 s to be of type @xmath32 if , labeling the legs in clockwise order , it is given by @xmath42 .",

    "the insight underlying the topological vertex @xcite is that the topological string partition function on a toric cy can also be pieced together patchwise .",
    "the patching conditions are implemented by placing non - compact lagrangian d - branes along the three legs of the web diagram of @xmath51 , intersecting the curves extending along these legs ( recall that the legs indicate where 2 of the 3 cycles of the @xmath6 fibration have degenerated ) in @xmath7 s .",

    "an application of the frobenius formula lets us solve ( [ repbasis ] ) for @xmath55 .",
    "the non - compactness of the lagrangian d - branes gives rise to an integer ambiguity @xcite , which necessitates specifying one integer per leg to full determine the vertex .",
    "@xcite refer to this choice as the framing of the vertex , since the integer ambiguity maps to the framing ambiguity of chern - simons theory under geometric transitions .",
    "the vertex in canonical framing is given by @xcite @xmath56 the notation is @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 are skew schur functions , defined by [ skew ] s_/ = _ c^ _ s _ , where the @xmath59 are tensor product coefficients , and @xmath60 . in the following , we will use the abbreviated notation @xmath61 whenever convenient , and imply a sum over repeated tableaux .",
    "a framing must be specified for each leg of the vertex .",
    "if we represent each leg by an integer vector @xmath62 , we can encode the framing by an integer vector @xmath63 that satisfies @xmath64 .",

    "the instanton piece of the partition function is given by z_conifold^inst&= & + & = & _ k=1^ ( 1- q q^-k)^k . in addition , the genus 0 and 1 free energy contain further polynomial dependence on @xmath133 . the behavior of the polynomial contributions to @xmath134 under flops can be considered separately from that of the instanton contributions @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the polynomial contribution to @xmath135 , @xmath136 , is naturally considered together with the instanton contribution to the partition function . by analytic continuation",
    ", we obtain the partition function of the topological string on the flopped geometry from the partition function on the pre - flop geometry , q^ z_conifold^inst(q ) q^- z_conifold^inst ( ) . to obtain the gopakumar - vafa invariants of the flopped geometry , we must now expand the rhs in the correct variable , @xmath28 , q^- z_conifold^inst(q^-1 ) & = & q^- _ k=1^ ( 1- ) ^k + & = & q^- q^-(-1 ) q^-(-2)_k=1^ ( q q^k -1)^k + & = & ( -1)^(-1 ) q^ _ k=1^ ( 1-q q^-k)^k . in the last line , we have used that @xmath137 is invariant under @xmath121 , and @xmath138 .",
    "we see that up to a phase , the partition function is invariant when analytically continued from @xmath28 to @xmath139 , and then re - expanded in powers of @xmath28 .",
    "it follows that the gopakumar - vafa invariants are in fact invariant under this flop",
    ".    now let s turn to flops on the strip .",
    "the normal bundles of the curves neighboring the flopped curve are affected by the flop . on the strip ,",
    "two geometries are to be distinguished : the @xmath11 curve to be flopped is connected along the strip to a @xmath11 curve on both sides ( figure [ flopcase1 ] ) , or to a @xmath11 curve on one side , and a @xmath10 curve on the other ( figure [ flopcase2 ] ) . after the flop ,",
    "the @xmath11 curves become @xmath10 curves in the former case , and the @xmath11 and @xmath10 curves are swapped in the latter .",
    "we will consider the first case in detail .",
    "the second works out in exact analogy . before the flop",
    ", we have three @xmath11 curves .",
    "the first vertex is @xmath43 , hence of type @xmath33 , from which we can determine the type of all vertices to be @xmath140 , yielding .",
    "[ preflop ] after the flop , note the important fact that the ordering of the vertices does not coincide with the ordering of the indices of the external young tableaux the vertices carry . assembling the data required to apply our rules in short hand : \\{@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 curves , first vertex of type @xmath33 } @xmath141 , we obtain .",
    "[ postflop ] to compare these two expressions , we can express the post - flop expression in terms of the pre - flop khler parameters , and then reexpand as in the case of the conifold considered above .",
    "the identification of the khler parameters that we propose is obtained by matching corresponding curves before and after the flop .",
    "considering e.g. the @xmath11 curves before and after the flop , we obtain the relations q_1 & = & _ 1 _ 2 , + q_2 & = & , + q_3 & = & _ 2 _ 3 , which are consistent with the identification we obtain by considering @xmath10 curves , q_1 q_2 & = & _ 1 , + q_2 q_3 & = & _ 3 .",
    "this identification of khler parameters is to be contrasted to the naive substitution @xmath142 for each curve whose khler parameter has @xmath143 dependence . upon making these substitutions ,",
    "the only factor in ( [ postflop ] ) which must be reexpanded is @xmath144 . using relation ( [ transposed ] ) and the definition of the pairing , we obtain ( dropping indices and renaming tableaux for ease of notation ) , \\{^t ^t}_q^-1(q ) & = & \\{}_q^-1 ( ) [ floppin ] + & = & _ k ( 1- q^-1 q^-k)^ c_k ( , ) + & = & _ k ( q^-1q^-k)^c_k ( , ) ( q q^k-1)^c_k ( , ) ( -q)^ + & = & q^-||-||q^-_k ( q q^k-1)^c_k ( , ) ( -q)^ + & = & ( -q)^-||-||q^- ( -q)^ \\{}_q ( q ) , where we have used @xcite _ k c_k ( , ) & = & ||+|| , + _ k k c_k ( , ) & = & .",
    "this almost coincides with the partition function ( [ preflop ] ) for the pre - flop geometry . to interpret the coefficients , let s include the two curves that are connected to the flopped curve via a sum over the representations @xmath145 and @xmath146 into our considerations .",
    "figure [ floptopbottom ] shows an example .",
    "the @xmath145 and @xmath146 dependent factors from the upper and lower part of the diagram before the flop are q_t^|_2| ( -1)^n_t |_2| q^- q_b^|_3| ( -1)^n_b |_3| q^- = q_t^|_2| ( -1)^|_2| q^- q_b^|_3| [ precoef ] , where @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "after the flop , we have _ t^|_2| ( -1)^_t |_2| q^- _ b^|_3| ( -1)^_b |_3| q^-=_t^|_2| _ b^|_3| ( -1)^-    @xmath149 and @xmath150 . combining ( [ postcoef ] ) with the coefficients from ( [ floppin ] ) , we obtain ( [ precoef ] ) , ( -q_2)^-|_2|-|_3|q^- _ t^|_2| _ b^|_3| ( -1)^- |_3| q^ & = & q_t^|_2| q_b^|_3| ( -1)^ |_2| q^- .",
    "we see that the coefficients in ( [ floppin ] ) are exactly those needed to maintain invariance of the gopakumar - vafa invariants under flops .",
    "this result continues to hold for the situation depicted in figure [ flopcase2 ] , as well as the other possible completions of the lines carrying the young tableaux @xmath145 and @xmath146 by curves of type @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "can we conclude that gopakumar - vafa invariants for toric calabi - yau are invariant under flops in general ?",
    "the above arguments were valid for geometries which contained only @xmath11 and @xmath10 curves .",
    "for the general case , the topological string partition function z = can be put in the product form @xcite z= _ ( _ k=1^ ( 1- q^k q_)^k n^0 _ _ g=1^ _ k=0 ^ 2g-2 ( 1 - q^g-1-kq^ ) ^(-1)^k+g n^g _ 2g-2 k ) , where @xmath151 encodes the classes of the various holomorphic curves relative to the basis specified by the @xmath29 . by the same argument as above , the only factor which needs to be re - expanded after expressing the post - flop partition function in pre - flop variables",
    "is the one counting contributions from just the flopped curve .",
    "as above , this factor is invariant , up to a coefficient , under this operation .",
    "however , it remains to argue that for the curves we identify before and after the flop , say @xmath151 and @xmath152 , the relation @xmath153 holds .",
    "for the case of geometries with only @xmath11 and @xmath10 curves , this equality followed from the comparison of ( [ preflop ] ) and ( [ postflop ] ) , and the interpetation of the coefficients in ( [ floppin ] ) .    note that after an appropriate number of blowups and flops , any toric cy can be decomposed into the strips we have been considering in this paper .",
    "hence , if gopakumar - vafa invariants indeed prove to be invariant under flops in general , the vertex calculations on a strip performed in this paper become relevant for any toric cy .",
    "a natural physical playground for the formalism developed in this paper is in the context of geometric engineering of @xmath154 gauge theories by compactification on local cy .",
