    "for the superconducting state in quasi - two - dimensional metal @xmath2 , the pairing symmetry is suggested to be the chiral @xmath3-wave pairing with the basic form @xmath4 and inplane equal - spin pairing .",
    "@xcite for the experimental evidence , the spin triplet pairing is supported by the @xmath5-nmr measurement , which reported that there is no reduction of the knight shift in the superconducting state .",
    "@xcite the pairing state with broken time reversal symmetry is claimed by the @xmath6sr measurement , which reported that spontaneous magnetic moment is induced in the superconducting state .",
    "@xcite    since the @xmath7 state and the @xmath8 state are degenerate at zero field , we expect the domain formation of the two states @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we call them as the @xmath9-wave domain and the @xmath10-wave domain , respectively .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted under external magnetic field perpendicular to the basal plane , since @xmath11 is the broken time reversal symmetry state with an orbital angular momentum along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "then , the vortex in the mixed state shows the different structure for the @xmath9-wave and the @xmath10-wave domains .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath13 for @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the charge of the cooper pair ) or equivalently when @xmath16 for @xmath17 . in these cases ,",
    "there appear winding @xmath18 vortices .",
    "it is parallel ( antiparallel ) to the internal winding of the cooper pair in the @xmath9-wave ( @xmath10-wave ) domain .",
    "the information of the vortex structure for the @xmath19-wave domain is important to analyze the chirality @xmath19 of each domain .",
    "the differences of the vortex structure for the @xmath9-wave and the @xmath10-wave domains have been studied by the two component ginzburg - laudau ( gl ) theory ,  @xcite the quasiclassical theory ,  @xcite and the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory .",
    "@xcite in the chiral @xmath3-wave superconductors , it is important to consider the opposite chiral component @xmath20 which is induced around the vortex of the dominant @xmath11 component in the @xmath19-wave domains .",
    "this induced component shows different spatial structure for the @xmath9-wave and the @xmath10-wave domains .",
    "this is the origin of the different vortex structure .",
    "there is a free energy difference between the @xmath9-wave and the @xmath10-wave domain cases in the vortex state , which leads to the different upper critical field @xmath21 for these chiral states .",
    "the estimation of @xmath21 was reported by scharnberg and klemm in the isotropic three dimensional fermi surface case.@xcite following their results , @xmath21 of the @xmath9-wave domain , which is noted as abm state , is near that of the isotropic @xmath22-wave pairing case , because the opposite @xmath8-component is not induced along @xmath21-line . on the other hand , the vortex state in the @xmath10-wave domain , which is noted as the generalized abm state or the sk state , gives higher @xmath21 because there is large induced @xmath7-component .",
    "that is , we can say that the superconductivity survives until high field in the @xmath10-wave domain case by the enhancement due to the induced opposite chiral component . since the difference of @xmath21 is large ( about twice ) for these domain cases ,",

    "it is accessible by the specific heat measurement .",
    "for example , in the @xmath24-wave pairing such as in high @xmath25 superconductors , there is a relation @xmath29 due to the line node of the superconducting gap for @xmath30.@xcite it is because low energy quasiparticles propagating to the node direction can extend far from vortex . in the relation @xmath31 in the @xmath22-wave pairing case",
