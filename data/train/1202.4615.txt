    "the light variability of the short - period contact binary sw lac ( p   0.@xmath032 , v@xmath1=8.@xmath291 ) is very well known and studied by several investigators since its discovery by ( * ? ? ?",

    "the first photoelectric ubv light curves of the system were obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brownlee ( 1956 ) ) , who also pointed out the light curve asymmetries from cycle to cycle .",
    "these asymmetries were confirmed and attributed to the existence of cool spot regions by several authors ( see ( * ? ? ? * albayrak et al .",

    "the spectral studies of the system including spectral classification , mass ratio determination and uv / x - ray region spectral analysis were carried out by several investigators , who revealed that the system is a w - type contact binary showing chromospheric and coronal activity ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the aim of this study is to perform the light curve analysis with the spot modeling , using the 2009 and 2010 light curves of the system with the help of the information coming from the doppler maps obtained by ( * ? ? ?",

    "the 2009 and 2010 bv band light curves of the contact binary sw lac were obtained at the ankara university observatory , using an apogee alta u47 ccd camera attached to a 40 cm schmidt - cassegrain telescope .",
    "bd+37@xmath3 4715 and bd+37@xmath3 4711 were chosen as comparison and check stars , respectively .",
    "the nightly extinction coefficients for each passband were determined by using the observations of the comparison star .",
    "a total of 700 and 995 data points were obtained in each passband , while the probable error of a single observation point was estimated to be @xmath4 and @xmath5 for 2009 and 2010 bv bands , respectively .",
    "the 2009 and 2010 bv light curves were analysed simultaneously with the radial velocity curves of the system obtained by ( * ? ? ?",

    "since the surface reconstructions of the system were performed using the time series spectra obtained in 2009 , we first adopted the spot modeling , as three main circular spot regions , to 2009 light curves and carried out the lc modeling ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the results from the lc and spot modeling were represented in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the analysis showed that the theoretical light curves are compatible with the observed ones , though the circular spot modeling was performed .",
    "however , in order to perform more reliable spot modeling , a code with a none circular shaped spot approximation is needed as the doppler maps clearly show us the spots are not circular ."

    "<S> in this study , we present the preliminary light curve analysis of the contact binary sw lac , using b , v light curves of the system spanning 2 years ( 2009 - 2010 ) . during the spot modeling process , we used the information coming from the doppler maps of the system , which was performed using the high resolution and phase dependent spectra obtained at the 2.1 m otto struve telescope of the mcdonald observatory , in 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> the results showed that the spot modeling from the light curve analysis are in accordance with the doppler maps , while the non - circular spot modeling technique is needed in order to obtain much better and reliable spot models . </S>"
