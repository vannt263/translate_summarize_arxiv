    "relay communication has recently drawn much interest from both academia and industry due to its potential ability to significantly improve the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems  @xcite .",
    "particularly , a simple three - node two - way relay network ( twrn ) has been widely studied in the literature and various relaying protocols have been proposed to achieve network throughput improvement  @xcite .",
    "however , most existing relaying protocols for twrns have been designed for the networks where the information messages exchanged between two source nodes are independent only .",
    "recently , some works have reported that measurements between different nodes in the network may exhibit strong correlations in some scenarios , e.g. , wireless sensor networks  @xcite . in such scenarios ,",
    "an efficient relaying protocol , which can exploit the inherent correlation characteristic , can further improve the system spectral efficiency and performance",
    ". this will be highly desirable when the source nodes want to exchange their correlated information messages with each other via the intermediate relaying nodes . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the multi - way relay network with correlated sources and orthogonal uplink channels .",
    "the paper mainly focused on the source - channel separation problems from an information theoretical point of view . in this letter , we consider the two - way relay networks with correlated sources ( twrn - cs ) and employ physical - layer network coding  ( pnc ) and practical huffman coding  @xcite to compress the correlated data in twrn .",
    "the main contributions and novelties of this letter are two - fold : 1 ) a compressed relaying scheme via huffman and physical - layer network coding ( hpnc ) is proposed for twrn - cs ; 2 ) compression rate is analyzed and a closed - form block error rate ( bler ) expression is derived for the hpnc scheme .",
    "it is shown that the hpnc scheme achieves considerable improvements in both network throughput and bler performance over the conventional non - compressed relaying scheme in twrn - cs .    _",
