    "the evolutionary game theory has been evolving and expanding progressively in the last years due to the emergent experimental facts and the deeper understanding of models developed [ for a survey see the books by @xcite , @xcite , and reviews by @xcite and by @xcite ] . in the last decades huge efforts are focused on the emergence of cooperative behavior because of its importance in many human and biological systems @xcite . in the first multi - agent evolutionary systems",
    "the repeated interaction is described by the payoff matrix of traditional game theory @xcite and the evolution is governed by a dynamical rule resembling the darwinian selection @xcite .",
    "the systematic investigations have explored the relevance of the games itself ( as interactions including the set of strategies ) , the connectivity structure , and also the dynamical rule .",
    "recently , the co - evolutionary games have extended the original frontiers of evolutionary games by introducing additional ( personal ) features and complex dynamical rules allowing the simultaneous time - dependence in each ingredient of the mathematical model .",
    "the possible personal character of players can be enhanced further in a way to postulate players who consider not just their own payoffs but also the neighbors income .    to elaborate this possibility we will study the social dilemmas with players located on a square lattice and collect income from @xmath5 games played with all their nearest neighbors .",
    "now , it is assumed that the myopic players wish to maximize their own utility function when they adopt another possible strategy . throughout this utility function",
    "the players combine the self - interest with the other - regarding preference in a tunable way .",
    "besides it , the applied strategy adoption rule involves some noise ( characterizing fluctuations in payoffs , mistakes and/or personal freedom in the decision ) that helps the system evolve towards the final stationary state via a spatial ordering process .",
    "the present work was motivated by our previous study considering the consequence of pairwise collective strategy updates in a similar model @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the frequency of cooperators is increased significantly in the case of prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) when two randomly chosen players favors a new strategy pair if it increases the sum of their individual payoff .",
    "the latter strategy update can be interpreted as a spatial extension of cooperative games where players can form coalitions to enhance the group income .",
    "some aspects of the other - regarding preference is modelled very recently by @xcite who studied a spatial evolutionary pd game with synchronized stochastic imitation . on the other hand , the experimental investigations of the human and animal behavior",
    "@xcite have also indicated the presence of different types of mutual helps @xcite , like charity @xcite , inequality aversion @xcite , and juvenile - adult interactions @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned relevant improvement in the level of cooperation has inspired us to quantify the effect of the group size and the number of players choosing new strategies simultaneously . from a series of numerical investigations",
    "we could draw a general picture that can be well exemplified with the present simpler model .",
    "more precisely , the most relevant improvement is achieved for those cases where each myopic player has taken into consideration all of her neighbor s payoff together with her own payoff with equal weight when selecting a new strategy .",
    "now we will study a more general model where the utility function of each player is combined from her own payoff and her co - players payoff with weight factors @xmath6 and @xmath1 . in this notation @xmath3",
    "represents a selfish myopic player who wish to maximize her own personal income irrespective of others .",
    "the fraternal players with @xmath2 favor to optimize the income ( redistributed and ) shared equally between each pair when choosing another strategy .",
    "the present model allows us to investigate the effect of other - regarding preference in spatial models for different levels of altruism ( @xmath1 ) . for the most altruistic case ( @xmath4 ) the players wish to maximize the co - players income and",
    "the system behavior also exhibits a state resembling the `` tragedy of the commons '' that can be interpreted as the `` lovers dilemma '' .",
    "it is emphasized that the resultant formalism ( payoff matrix ) of the other - regarding preference was already investigated by @xcite as a model to capture the kin- and group - selection mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the origin of the basic idea goes back to the work of @xcite and @xcite who studied animal behaviors between relatives .",
    "the present work can be considered as a continuation of the mentioned investigations .",
    "now our attention will be focused on the consequences of structured population for a myopic strategy update .",
    "using the terminology of social dilemmas @xcite the above mentioned model with a stochastic myopic strategy update is defined and contrasted with other versions in the following section .",
    "the results of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are summarized in section [ mc ] for a finite noise level .",
    "section [ stabanal ] is addressed to the spatial stability analysis in the zero noise limit and the main results are discussed in the final section .",
    "the possible solutions of the two - person , two - strategy evolutionary games depend on the details including the spatial structure , the range of interactions , the payoffs , the dynamical rule(s ) , the payoffs , and the measure of noise @xcite . before specifying the presently studied model",
    "accurately we briefly survey the main features of these solutions .",
    "we consider a simple model with players located on the sites @xmath7 of a square lattice ( consisting of @xmath8 sites with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "each player can follow one of the two strategies called unconditional cooperation ( @xmath9 ) or unconditional defection ( @xmath10 ) within the context of social dilemmas . if these strategies are denoted by two - dimensional unit vectors , as @xmath11 then the payoff of player @xmath7 against her neighbor at site @xmath12 can be expressed by the following matrix product : @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the transpose of the state vector @xmath15 .",
    "the payoff matrix is given as @xmath16 where the reward of mutual cooperation is chosen to be unity ( @xmath17 ) and the mutual defection yields zero income ( @xmath18 ) for both players without any loss of generality .",
    "the cooperator receives @xmath19 ( sucker s payoff ) against a defector who gets @xmath20 , the temptation to choose defection .",
    "this terminology was originally introduced for the description of prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) ( where @xmath21 ) and later extended for weaker social dilemmas @xcite , too .    for this notation",
    "the @xmath22 payoff plane can be divided into four segments ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : socdil ] ) where the possible nash equilibria are denoted by pairs of open , closed , or half - filled circles referring to pure cooperation , pure defection , and mixed strategies , respectively .",
    "for example , within the range of harmony ( h ) game the nash equilibrium ( from which no player has incentives to deviate unilaterally ) is the ( pareto optimal ) mutual cooperation . on the contrary",
    ", for the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) the only nash equilibrium is the mutual defection yielding the second worst payoff .",
    "figure  [ fig : socdil]a illustrates that both the @xmath23 and @xmath24 strategy pairs are nash equilibria within the region of stag hunt ( sh ) game where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for the hawk - dove ( hd ) game besides the @xmath27 and @xmath28 strategy pairs there is an additional ( so - called mixed ) nash equilibrium where the players can choose either cooperation or defection with a probability dependent on the payoff parameters .",
    "many relevant features of these types of evolutionary games have already been clarified .",
    "for example , if the frequency of cooperators and defectors are controlled by a replicator dynamics ( favoring the strategy of higher payoff ) within a well - mixed population then the system evolves towards a final stationary state related to the possible nash equilibria as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : socdil]b @xcite .",
    "namely , cooperators ( defectors ) die out within the region of pd ( h game ) while they can coexist for the case of hd game . the radial segmentation of the region of sh game in fig .",
    "[ fig : socdil]b indicates that here the system develops into one of the homogeneous phase and the final result depends on the composition of the initial state .",
    "the spatial arrangement of players ( with a short range interaction ) , however , affects significantly the evolutionary process depending on the payoffs . for the present lattice system one can evaluate the total sum of individual payoffs for the ordered arrangement of @xmath29 and @xmath30 strategies .",
    "figure  [ fig : socdil]c shows that the maximum total payoff is achieved for homogeneous cooperation ( @xmath31 if @xmath32 . in the opposite case ( @xmath33 ) the total ( or average ) payoff",
    "is maximized if the cooperators and defectors are arranged in a chessboard - like manner as indicated by the pattern @xcite .    the comparison of the figs .",
    "[ fig : socdil]a and [ fig : socdil]c illustrates the relevant differences between the suggestions of traditional game theory when assuming two selfish players and the optimum total payoff with respect to the whole society with players located on the sites of a square lattice . notice , that the chessboard - like arrangement of cooperators and defectors can provide optimal total payoff within a region involving a suitable part of the pd , the hd , and the h games .",
    "the curiosity of these systems is more pronounced if we compare it with the consequences of different evolutionary rules in the lattice models @xcite . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : socdil]d we summarize only the results of a spatial evolutionary game @xcite obtained when the myopic players can choose another strategy if this change increases their own payoff assuming quenched neighborhood in the zero noise limit .      in the present work",
    "the latter dynamical rule is extended by allowing players to consider not only their own but also their neighbors payoffs .",
    "the system is started from a random initial strategy distribution where both @xmath29 and @xmath30 strategies are present with the same frequency .",
    "the evolution of the strategy distribution is controlled by repeating the random sequential strategy updates in myopic manner .",
    "accordingly , in each elementary step we choose a player @xmath7 at random who can modify her strategy from @xmath15 to @xmath34 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath35 or _",
    "vice versa _ ) with a probability : @xmath36 } \\ ; , \\label{eq : dyn}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 characterizes the average amplitude of noise ( that can appear for fluctuating payoffs ) disturbing the players rational decision and the utility function combines the payoffs of the player @xmath7 with the payoffs of her co - players within the same games .",
    "namely , @xmath38\\,,\\ ] ] where the summation runs over all nearest neighbors pairs . in this notation @xmath1 characterizes the strength of altruism of the player . for simplicity",
    ", we now assume that all players have have the same @xmath1 value , thus the whole population is described by the same attitude of selfishness .",
    "for @xmath3 the players are selfish and the resultant behavior has already been explored in a previous work @xcite . if @xmath2 then each player tries to maximize a payoff obtained by sharing equally the common payoffs between the interacting players . in the extreme case ( @xmath4 ) players focus exclusively on maximizing the other s income .",
    "to give real - life example , the latter behavior mimics the attitude of lovers or the behavior of relatives in biological systems as discussed by @xcite .",
    "notice that the present model can be mapped into a spatial evolutionary game with selfish ( @xmath3 ) players for myopic strategy update if we introduce an effective payoff matrix , @xmath39 the effective payoff matrix becomes symmetric for @xmath2 and the corresponding model is equivalent to a kinetic ising model where the evolution of spin configuration is controlled by the glauber dynamics in the presence of a unit external magnetic field @xcite . in the latter case the system evolves towards a stationary state where",
    "the probability of a configuration can be described by the boltzmann statistics and the laws of thermodynamics are valid @xcite .",
    "finally we emphasize that the simultaneous exchanges @xmath40 and @xmath41 leave the system ( @xmath42 ) unchanged .",
    "this is the reason why the mc analysis can be restricted to the cases where @xmath43 .",
    "the mc simulations are performed when varying the payoffs @xmath19 and @xmath20 at a few representative values of @xmath1 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in most of the cases",
    "the system is started from a random initial state and after a suitable thermalization time @xmath46 the stationary state is characterized by the fraction of cooperators ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) averaged over a sampling time @xmath49 in the sublattices @xmath50 and @xmath51 corresponding to the white and black boxes on the chessboard .",
    "in fact there exist two equivalent sublattice ordered arrangements of cooperators and defectors : ( 1 ) @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; ( 2 ) @xmath54 and @xmath55 if @xmath56 . during the transient time",
    "both types of ordered arrangements are present in a poly - domain structure and the typical linear size of domains growth as @xmath57 .",
    "such a situation can occur for example within the region of hd game as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : domgrow ] .    finally one of the ordered structure prevails the whole spatial system . evidently , the requested thermalization time ( to achieve the final mono - domain structure ) increases with system size as @xmath58 .    it is emphasized that the domain growing process is blocked for those dynamical rules forbidding the adoption of irrational choices ( when @xmath59 ) .",
    "the latter cases yield frozen poly - domain patterns where @xmath60 as described by @xcite .",
    "the present evolutionary rule allows the irrational choices with a probability decreasing very fast when @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , the expected value of @xmath46 is also increased drastically if @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the resultant technical difficulties can be avoided if the system is started from a biased initial state where one of the sublattice is occupied by only cooperators ( or defectors ) while other sites are filled randomly with @xmath29 or @xmath30 players .    for selfish players ( @xmath3 ) the results of mc simulations",
    "are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : q00 ] in the low noise limit where the readers can distinguish three types of ordered structure .",
    "namely , the above mentioned sublattice ordering occurs within the territory of hd game .",
    "the `` homogeneous '' @xmath30 and @xmath29 phases are separated by a first order transition located along the line @xmath61 when varying the payoff parameters .",
    "more precisely , @xmath62 in the limit @xmath56",
    "if @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    on the contrary , the system evolves into a state called `` tragedy of the commons '' ( @xmath65 if @xmath56 ) when @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the case of finite noise ,",
    "the sharp ordered phases disappear and point defect can emerge resulting in intermediate values for cooperator frequency . notice that the transitions from the homogeneous phases to the symmetry breaking sublattice ordered structure follow similar scenario .",
    "namely , the stationary frequency of cooperators evolves toward a state ( where @xmath68 ) when approaching the critical point from the homogeneous regions while @xmath69 vanishing algebraically from the opposite direction .",
    "the width of the transition regime in both side of the critical point is proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "the sublattice ordering as a continuous transition belongs to the ising universality class @xcite .",
    "this means that the vanishing order parameter ( @xmath70 ) follows a power law behavior when approaching the critical point and simultaneously the correlation length , the relaxation time , and the magnitude of fluctuations diverge algebraically .",
    "the latter effects imply an increase in the uncertainty of the numerical data . to avoid this problem we used a significantly larger size ( typically @xmath71 ) and longer thermalization and sampling time ( @xmath72 mcs ) in the close vicinity of the transition point . using this method",
    "we could reduce the statistical error comparable to the line thickness .",
    "all the above mentioned three phases and also the main characteristics of the phase transitions are present for @xmath73 as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : q033 ] . the most striking difference between figs .",
    "[ fig : q00 ] and [ fig : q033 ] is the shift of the phase boundaries . as a consequence for @xmath73 the territory of the `` tragedy of the commons '' ( in the @xmath74 plane )",
    "is reduced .",
    "similar behavior was observed in a model where the evolution is controlled by pairwise collective strategy update @xcite .",
    "fundamentally different behavior is found for the fraternal players ( @xmath2 ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : q05 ] .",
    "in this case the results depend only on @xmath75 and the system does not fall into the state of the `` tragedy of the commons '' . it is emphasized that in the zero noise limit the system evolves into the state providing the maximum total payoff ( compare figs .  [",
    "fig : socdil]c and [ fig : q05 ] ) .",
    "the above numerical investigations were repeated for several noise levels , too .",
    "these numerical data have justified that in the zero noise limit the @xmath74 phase diagrams coincide with those we derived from stability analysis of the spatial patterns .",
    "to have a deeper understanding about the ordering process , we first study the stability of the sublattice ordered arrangement of strategies against a single strategy flip in the zero noise limit .",
    "the two possibilities are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulkinst ] .    in the first case a defector reverses its strategy",
    "if the cooperation yields higher utility , that is , if @xmath76 < 4   \\label{eq : afdtoc1}\\ ] ] or after some algebraic simplification @xmath77 due to the absence of the second neighbor interactions all the defectors ( within the chessboard like structure ) are enforced to cooperate in the low noise limit if the condition ( [ eq : afdtoc ] ) is satisfied .",
    "consequently , in this case the sublattice ordered arrangement of cooperation and defection transforms into homogeneous cooperation .",
    "one can easily check that the appearance of a single defector in the state of homogeneous cooperation is favored if @xmath78 which is the opposite of the condition ( [ eq : afdtoc ] ) .",
    "the random sequential repetition of this type of point defect yields a poly - domain structure resembling to those plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : domgrow ] . as mentioned before , this poly - domain structure is not stable for @xmath79 because the fluctuations changes the sizes of ordered domains and their vanishing is not balanced by the appearance of new domains",
    ". finally the system evolves into one of the sublattice ordered structure .    from the above analysis",
    "one can conclude that the equation @xmath80 determines the position of the phase boundary separating the sublattice ordered phase from the homogeneous cooperation in the @xmath74 plane .",
    "this mathematical expression reflects clearly that the straight line phase boundary rotates anti - clockwise around the point ( @xmath81 ) from the vertical direction to the horizontal one when increasing the value of @xmath1 from 0 to 1 .",
    "the above described analysis can be repeated to study the stability of the sublattice ordered structure against a single strategy change from @xmath29 to @xmath30 as plotted on the right - hand side of fig .  [",
    "fig : bulkinst ] .",
    "it is found that the sublattice ordered structure evolves into the homogeneous @xmath30 phase if @xmath82 and the resulting equation @xmath83 gives a boundary line separating the sublattice ordered phase from the homogeneous defection state in the payoff plane .",
    "this phase boundary is also a straight line rotating clockwise around the point @xmath84 from the horizontal ( @xmath3 ) to the vertical ( @xmath4 ) direction .    the phase boundaries ( [ eq : afcpb ] ) and ( [ eq : afdpb ] ) divide the @xmath74 plane into four segments excepting the case @xmath2 when the given straight lines are parallel .",
    "for @xmath3 these segments are equivalent to those types of games indicated in figs .",
    "[ fig : socdil ] .",
    "the above stability analysis allows the existence of both the homogeneous @xmath29 and @xmath30 phases within the region of sh game .",
    "the simulations indicate the presence of both phases in a poly - domain structure during a transient period .",
    "the final result of the competition between these two ordered structure can be deduced by determining the average velocity of the boundary separating the regions of homogeneous cooperation and defection . for the present dynamical rule",
    "the most frequent elementary changes are the shifts of a step - like interface as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : invasion ]",
    ".    evidently other elementary processes are also observable with a vanishing probability when @xmath56 .",
    "the latter elementary processes ( e.g. the creation of a new step ) can affect only the average velocity of the interface . using the above observation as a working hypotheses",
    "we can derive a condition for the direction of invasion that is justified by the mc simulations .",
    "namely , along the horizontal interface the step moves right in the zero noise limit if @xmath85 .",
    "this yields @xmath30 invasion if @xmath86 > 2[1+(1-q)s+qt ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : dinv}\\ ] ] in the opposite case @xmath29 invasion is preferred and the system evolves into the state where all the players cooperate .",
    "thus , the position of the phase boundary separating the homogeneous @xmath29 and @xmath30 phases can be given by a straight line @xmath87 in the @xmath74 plane .",
    "here it is worth mentioning that the phase boundary determined by ( [ eq : cdpb ] ) coincides with those suggestion derived from the criterion of risk dominance @xcite favoring the selection of those strategy that provides higher utility if the co - player chooses her strategy at random .",
    "in other words , the present myopic strategy update ( on the square lattice ) can be considered as a realization of the criterion of risk dominance in the crucial local constellations because the players @xmath7 and @xmath88 are surrounded by two cooperators and two defectors .",
    "the results of the above stability analysis are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : multi ] .",
    "it is emphasized that the three phase boundaries [ given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : afcpb ] ) , ( [ eq : afdpb ] ) , and ( [ eq : cdpb ] ) ] meet at a so - called tricritical point ( if @xmath89 ) and divide the @xmath74 plane into three parts in agreement with the expectations deduced from the mc results in the low noise limit .",
    "[ fig : multi ] illustrates graphically what happens if the value of @xmath1 is increased gradually .",
    "the territory of the homogeneous cooperation and the sublattice ordered structures expand in the @xmath74 plane at the expense of the homogeneous defection if @xmath90 . evidently this process is accompanied with a relevant increase in the total payoff for the payoff parameters involved .",
    "this process is saturated for @xmath2 when the system achieves the optimum total payoff for any payoff matrix . for further increase of @xmath1 the process",
    "is reversed within some territory of h and sh games where the system can evolve into the `` tragedy of the commons '' as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] for @xmath4 when the system ( effective payoff ) can be mapped to the case of selfish player by exchanging the payoffs @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , the overstatement of the other regarding preference may also results in a social dilemma .",
    "we have introduced a spatial evolutionary game with a myopic strategy update rule to study what happens if the players characters , regarding the target utility , are tuned continuously .",
    "the two extreme characters are the egoist players ( maximizing their own income irrespective of others ) and the completely altruistic players or lovers who try to maximize the others income irrespective of their own payoff .",
    "this feature is quantified by introducing a utility function composed from the player s and the co - player s incomes with suitable weight factors .",
    "it turned out that all the relevant results can be explained by considering an effective payoff matrix in agreement with previous investigations @xcite . despite its simplicity",
    "this model indicated clearly the importance of the fraternal behavior .",
    "namely , the highest total income is achieved by the society whose members share their income fraternally . any deviation from the fraternal behavior can result in the emergence of the `` tragedy of the commons '' within a suitable region of payoff parameters even for altruistic players characterized by the other - regarding preference .    finally , to exemplify the lover s dilemma we end this work by citing the opening sentences of the paper by @xcite : `` there is a famous story written by ohenry about a poor young couple in love at christmas time ( ' ' the gift of the magi `` ) .",
    "neither has any money with which to buy the other a present , although each knows what the other wants .",
    "each has only one prized possession : he , his father s gold pocket watch ; she , her beautiful long hair . he has long been coveting a gold watch fob , while she has long admired a pair of tortoise shell hair combs in a nearby shop .",
    "the conclusion of the story is the exchange of gifts , along with a description of their means of getting the money for their purchases .",
    "he gives her the combs ( having pawned his watch to raise the money ) .",
    "she gives him the watch fob ( having cut and sold her hair ) . ''",
    "the mentioned example is discussed exhaustively in the text book by @xcite ."
