    "the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) is one of the most widely studied systems in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "it represents a model of recognized importance , which offers the opportunity to explore the quantum behavior of many - body systems on a fundamental basis and provides a ground test for several quantum chemistry @xcite , many - body @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite methodologies .",
    "furthermore , recent years have witnessed the realization of increasingly high - quality two - dimensional ( 2d ) hegs in devices of considerable experimental interest such as quantum - well structures @xcite and field - effect transistors @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of qmc calculations for the heg is unavoidably limited by the well - known sign problem @xcite , arising from the antisymmetry of many - fermion wavefunctions .",
    "the vast majority of qmc simulations of many - fermion systems circumvent the sign problem relying on the fixed - node ( fn ) approximation @xcite .",
    "methodologies based on the fn approximation provide very accurate estimations of ground state properties such as the kinetic and potential energy , and the static structure factor . on the other hand ,",
    "as the extension of the fn approximation to the manifold of excited states is less understood and established @xcite , the study of dynamical properties of many - fermion systems is a very active and challenging research field @xcite .    in a recent work @xcite , performing an extensive study of exactly solvable few - fermion hamiltonians , we have shown that the phaseless auxiliary fields quantum monte carlo ( afqmc ) @xcite method can become an important tool for the calculation of imaginary time correlation functions",
    ".    motivated by this result , in the present work we apply the phaseless afqmc method to the 2d heg .",
    "in particular , we focus on the high - density regime ( @xmath2 ) , since our previous study has revealed that the computational cost of the algorithm increases severely with @xmath3 , making a study at high @xmath3 hardly practicable .",
    "this is due to the fact that , increasing @xmath3 , the number of plane waves required to reach convergence in the basis set size becomes larger , making cumbersome to perform the linear algebra operations required by the methodology . from a more physical point of view , the stronger correlations give rise to a more pronounced curvature in the wave function , which is accurately reproduced by a large number of fourier coefficients .",
    "nevertheless , the high - density regime is extremely interesting as the presence of the interaction leads to the emergence of important correlation effects , enhanced by the low dimensionality .",
    "we evaluate density - density correlation functions in imaginary time @xmath4 and we perform their inverse laplace transform to extract information about the excitations of the system . we introduce and describe a method for stabilizing the calculation of imaginary time correlation functions in afqmc , and present numerical tests demonstrating its accuracy .",
    "we finally assess the accuracy of the calculations comparing afqmc results with predictions within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) for finite systems @xcite .",
    "we also compare afqmc estimates with the results of fixed - node calculations @xcite , performed with a nodal structure encompassing optimized rational backflow correlations @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the phaseless afqmc method is briefly reviewed in section [ method ] , the results of the study are discussed in section [ results ] , and conclusions are drawn in the last section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the 2d heg is a system of charged spin-@xmath5 fermions interacting with the coulomb potential and immersed in a uniform positively - charged background . for the purpose of studying the 2d heg",
    "we simulate a system of @xmath6 particles moving inside a square region @xmath7 of surface @xmath8 , employing periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) at the boundaries of the simulation domain , in conjunction with an ewald summation procedure @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "energies are measured in hartree units @xmath9 , and lengths in bohr radii @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads , in such units : @xmath11 where spin - definite plane waves : @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 are used as a basis for the single - particle hilbert space .",
    "the ground - state energy per particle of the system is obtained adding , to the mean value of , the corrective constant term : @xmath15 = - 3.900265 \\ , \\frac{1}{2l}\\ ] ] arising from the ewald summation procedure employed @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian can be parametrized in terms of the dimensionless seitz radius @xmath3 defined by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the density of the system and @xmath10 the bohr radius .",
    "this parametrization shows that the matrix elements of the kinetic energy roughly scale as @xmath18 , and those of the potential energy as @xmath19 .",
    "thus , for increasing seitz radius , the interaction part of @xmath20 plays a more and more relevant role .      to address the calculation of static and dynamical properties of the 2dheg ,",
    "we rely on the phaseless afqmc method @xcite , that moves from observation that the imaginary time propagator @xmath21 acts as a projector onto the ground state @xmath22 of the system in the limit of large imaginary time . therefore , as long as a trial state @xmath23 has non - zero overlap with @xmath22 the relation : @xmath24 holds , @xmath25 being the ground state energy , that can be estimated adaptively following a common procedure in diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations @xcite .",
    "qmc methods rely on the observation that the deterministic evolution can be mapped onto suitable stochastic processes and solved by randomly sampling appropriate probability distributions .",
    "determinantal qmc methods , such as the phaseless afqmc , use a slater determinant as trial state @xmath26 , typically the hartree - fock state , and map onto a stochastic process in the abstract manifold @xmath27@xmath28 of @xmath6-particle slater determinants .",

    "the second factor , together with the introduction of the shift parameters , has been argued in @xcite to keep the overlap between the determinants involved in the random walk and the trial determinant far from zero .",
    "in fact , the angle @xmath43 corresponds to the flip in the phase of a determinant during a step of the random walk : the term @xmath44 is meant to suppress determinants whose phase undergoes an abrupt change , under the assumption @xcite that such behaviour indicates the vanishing of the overlap with the trial state .      in general ,",
    "the structure of @xmath45 is specified through a procedure that might result lengthy and computationally expensive @xcite . when spin - definite plane waves are used as a basis for the single - particle hilbert space ,",

    "the formalism outlined in [ phaseless_afqmc ] , [ phaseless_afqmc_num ] enables the calculation of ground state properties , and also of the _ imaginary time correlation function _ ( itcf ) : @xmath61 of two single - particle many - body operators @xmath62 .",

    "the issue of computing itcfs is complicated by the circumstance that the one - body operators @xmath62 do not map slater determinants onto slater determinants , but on rather complicated states .",

    "@xcite we have pointed out that , due to the presence of such matrix elements , the estimator is negatively - conditioned by a form of numeric instability .",

    "however , it is well - known @xcite that raising @xmath151 can result in an increase in variance , which severely limits the possibility of extracting physical information from the long imaginary - time tails of the itcfs .",

    "as it is well - known @xcite , it is highly non - trivial to extract physical information from itcfs . in the case of the heg , the finite size of the systems under study induces to expect contributions to @xmath139 coming from excited states of the system , which are obtained from the ground state by creation of particle - hole pairs .",
    "the dynamical structure factor @xmath81 , the inverse laplace transform of @xmath139 , is thus expected to display multiple peaks corresponding to the excitation energies . this picture is confirmed by rpa calculations for finite systems , reported in appendix [ app : rpa ] .",
    "the presence of multiple peaks complicates the task of performing the analytic continuation providing an estimation of @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , since the number of peaks grows rapidly with the wave - vector modulus @xmath155 , we have limited our attention to the wave - vectors @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",

    "the frequencies predicted by the rpa are represented as impulses with height equal to the corresponding weights .",
    "we see that , at @xmath171 , there is a close agreement between afqmc and rpa predictions of both frequencies and spectral weights .",
    "since it is known that , for small @xmath3 , rpa predictions are very accurate , such agreement provides a robust check for the reliability of afqmc methodology in providing information about the manifold of excited states of the system .",
    "it is well known @xcite that , in the same situation , calculations of @xmath139 based on the fixed - node approximation would give inaccurate results even if the nodal structure of the ground state wave function is known with very high accuracy . as @xmath3 increases , discrepancies appear between the two approaches .",
    "the presence of such discrepancies is naturally expected : none of the methodologies used in the present work is free from approximations . the approximations underlying rpa and afqmc , in particular , are quite different in nature and are expected to agree only in the limit of high density ( very low @xmath3 ) . incidentally , we observe that , due to the finite size of the systems investigated , we can not provide quantitative predictions about the plasmonic mode , which becomes a well defined collective excitation in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "what we expect is that , as the system size becomes large enough , of the several peaks that are present for the finite systems , one will acquire a dominant spectral weight , eventually becoming a well defined collective excitation . in order to further assess the quality of our results , in tables [ tab : eg ] , [ tab : sq ] and [ tab : chiq ]",

    "as far as ground state energies per particle are concerned , as shown in table [ tab : eg ] , at @xmath175 the three methods give compatible results . as @xmath3 increases , afqmc estimates are always closer to fn than rpa , lying between them .",
    "the configurational quantum monte carlo evaluation of the ground state per particle has been obtained via diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) calculation , with a nodal structure encompassing backflow correlations , optimized by means of the linear method @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that fn calculations with optimized nodal structures yield highly accurate estimates of the ground state energy , as confirmed by comparison with full configuration interaction qmc calculations @xcite : this result , therefore , confirms the great accuracy of the phaseless approximation @xcite .    the configurational qmc evaluation of the static structure factor @xmath176 has been obtained via fn dmc calculations with the nodal structure described above .",
    "dmc estimates have been extrapolated @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have compared afqmc estimations of the static density response function @xmath174 with rpa and fixed - node estimations . in principle",
    ", the fixed - node evaluation of the static density response function @xmath174 is highly non trivial , involving the manifold of excited states .",
    "however , it is well - known that this difficulty can be circumvented @xcite extracting @xmath174 from the ground state energy @xmath177 of a system subject to an external periodic potential of amplitude @xmath178 in the @xmath179 limit .",
    "we observe that , increasing @xmath3 above @xmath180 , the afqmc predictions remain , in general , closer to the configurational monte carlo ones than to the rpa ones : this is a strong indication about the quality of afqmc results , since the monte carlo calculations include correlations beyond the rpa level .",
    "this result is remarkable , since the afqmc evaluation of @xmath174 is considerably influenced by the low - energy excitations which , if predicted unaccurately , can significantly bias the result .",
    "as @xmath3 further increases , however , the agreement decreases .",

    "<S> we show that such methodology , once equipped with suitable numerical stabilization techniques necessary to deal with exponentials , products and inversions of large matrices , gives access to the calculation of imaginary time correlation functions for medium - sized systems ; we present simulations of a number up to @xmath0 correlated fermions in the continuum , using up to @xmath1 plane waves as basis set elements . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the numerical stabilization techniques and the computational complexity of the methodology . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the inverse laplace transform of the obtained density - density correlation functions , assessing the ability of the phaseless auxiliary field quantum monte carlo method to evaluate dynamical properties of many - fermion systems . </S>"
