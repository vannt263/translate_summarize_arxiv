    "in  @xcite , barannikov and kontsevich have found a solution to the wdvv equation starting from the algebra of polyvector fields on calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "the algebraic properties of polyvector fields used in their construction are captured by an abstract algebraic structure called dgbv - algebra with hodge property .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is a new interpretation of barannikov - kontsevich construction .",
    "we represent their solution as a sum over trivalent trees . using this representation",
    "we give a new independent proof that this sum over trivalent trees satisfies the wdvv equation .",
    "since we have a sum over trivalent trees , it is very natural to study the sum over graphs of higher genera ( with the same tensor expressions associated to elements of graphs ) .",
    "we prove that in genus @xmath2 our construction satisfied the getzler elliptic equation  @xcite .",
    "but in order to prove this we have introduced a new surprising algebraic axiom ( we call it @xmath0 axiom , see sections  [ the-1 - 12-axiom ] ) .    probably , the main problem for us was to find a proper explanation of this additional axiom .",
    "in fact , in order to obtain naturally the genus @xmath1 part of our construction ( i.e. , barannikov - kontsevich solution in terms of trivalent trees ) it is enough to study the bcov - action written down in  @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "but then we have to introduce @xmath0-axiom just for computational reasons , and getzler s relation in genus @xmath2 comes over as a miracle .",
    "so , we have found another approach to the explanation of our results .",
    "it is a kind of an `` operadic '' homotopy extension of gromov - witten theory in the spirit of getzler  @xcite and zwiebach  @xcite . in this framework",
    "all our axioms including @xmath0-axiom come very natural .",
    "moreover , in this approach the relations coming from geometry of the moduli space of curves seem to be very expected .",
    "this is an amazing fact that there are two completely different natural approaches to the same construction : one is from the @xmath3-model side ( barannikov - kontsevich ) and another one is from the @xmath4-model side ( we call it the theory of zwiebach invariants ) .    for introduction we have chosen the second approach , since it better explains our results .",
    "however , the origin of the idea to use trivalent trees is also hidden in the first approach and we explain this in the appendix .",
    "string theory appeared in the beginning of seventies as an attempt to find fundamental degrees of freedom that would form theory free of ultraviolet divergences and give gravity as a low energy effective theory .    in its standard formulation",
    "the string theory computes @xmath5-loop scattering amplitudes of @xmath6 particles into @xmath7-particles as an integral over the moduli space of complex structures of the genus @xmath5 surface with @xmath8 marked points .",
    "the measure of integration is a correlator in a very specific conformal field theory that has an odd symmetry @xmath9 ( such that @xmath10 ) and so - called ghosts ( due to gauge fixing of the diffeomorphism invariance ) .",
    "energy - momentum tensor in such theory is @xmath9-exact .    in the process of study of string theory",
    "it was generalized to the so - called topological string theory .",
    "in topological string theory conformal theory with ghosts is replaced by a more general conformal theory with @xmath9-symmetry and ( co)exact energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the most impressive application of these ideas is the theory of geometric gromov - witten invariants ( known in physics as type @xmath4 topological strings ) .",
    "this theory attracted a lot of attention in last decade since its amplitudes give answers to famous problems in enumerative algebraic geometry .",
    "further generalization of these ideas involves the construction of the set of factorizable closed forms on the moduli spaces of complex structures on riemann surfaces ( so that the integral of the top form produces amplitudes ) . in this way",
    "we get generalized amplitudes that take values in cohomology of the moduli space .",
    "evaluation of these generalized amplitudes on the contractible cycles ( together with the factorization property ) leads to relations among amplitudes ( wdvv and getzler relations ) that are very important in applications .",
    "this leads to the new definition of amplitudes as a system of factorizable maps from the tensor products of the vector space with bilinear pairing to cohomology of the moduli spaces of riemann surfaces that we call simply gromov - witten invariants .",
    "note , that here we do not insist that amplitudes come from the integral over the moduli space of differential forms coming from conformal field theory ; we study amplitudes on their own .",
    "note , that formalization of general ( irrational ) conformal field theory produces objects that are rather dificult to deal with .",
    "one has to study infinite sums of tensor products of two irreducible representations of chiral algebras that have to obey additional conditions coming from the duality ( see  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise , one has to study various limits of rational conformal theories when the number of irreducible representation goes to infinity .",
    "it is really a challenge to develop such a theory in full generality and to find a reasonable amount of understandable examples ( as far as we know only the theory on a torus and on its orbifolds are constructively known among irrational theories ) .",
    "such an understanding would be a curious extension of differential geometry but it is out of reach for a moment .",
    "therefore we have to wait a bit before we can say something constructive about general irrational conformal theories with @xmath9-symmetry and exact energy - momentum tensor .",
    "however , we can say something about the degeneration of this magnificent picture in the limit where the conformal theory degenerates so that the conformal dimensions of some fields tend to zero ( note that there are fields with exactly zero dimension among them ) .",
    "it seems that we can write down tractible axioms on correlators of fields with nearly zero dimension ( viewed as differential forms on the proper moduli spaces ) at the point of degeneration  we will call these zwiebach invariants .",
    "one can show at the heuristic level that the amplitudes in the nearly degenerate theory can be obtained as a sum over graphs with zwiebach invariants associated to vertices .",
    "our next step would be to forget about the conformal field theory origin of the procedure and to study the theory of zwiebach invariants ( as a sets of maps taking values in forms on the moduli spaces that obeys some axioms ) on their own .",
    "it is similar to forgetting the conformal field theory origin of the gromov - witten invariants .",
    "however , we will show that now we may also formalize the passage to the nearly degenerate theory , when dimension of some fields is lifted .",
    "we will see that this leads to the procedure of induction of the structure of the zwiebach invariant on the subbicomplexes . and zwiebach invariants of bicomplex with zero differential turn out to be gromov - witten invariants .",
    "after presenting the outline of such general construction we have to study the confirming example  and we really do it .",
    "namely , we study the case when zwiebach invariants take the simplest possible form ",
    "they are constructed from the hodge dgbv algebra that satisfies the @xmath0 axiom , and ( possibly ) some other conditions . instead of looking for the formal proof that the set of these other conditions is empty ( we admit that it would be nice to have such a proof ) we just compute directly induced structures on cohomology of the bicomplex in genera zero and one .",
    "we show by explicit computation that these structures do solve wdvv and getzler equations .",
    "all this should be compared with the theory of induction of the homotopical structure on the subcomplex .",
    "the simplest homotopical structure is the structure of differential graded ( lie ) algebra .",
    "therefore , we propose the generalization of this story to the bicomplexes with dga being replaced by hodge dgbv with @xmath0 axiom , and homotopical algebra structure being replaced by zwiebach invariants .",
    "the natural question to ask is whether all zwiebach invariant can be obtained by induction from the simplest ones ( like all homotopical algebras can be obtained by induction from the differential graded ones ) .",
    "we do not know the answer at the moment .",
    "we hope that the notion of zwiebach invariants will help to understand why constructions of  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite lead to gromov - witten invariants .      by gromov - witten invariants",
    "we mean the set of maps @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a vector space and @xmath13 is the space of cycles in the deligne - mumford compactification of the moduli space of genus @xmath5 curves with @xmath8 marked points @xmath14 .",
    "this set of maps satisfies the following conditions  @xcite :    1 .",
    "it is symmetric with respect to diagonal action of the symmetric group on factors of @xmath15 and cycles in @xmath14 .",
    "2 .   it vanishes when restricted to cycles that are zero in rational homologies of @xmath14 3 .",
    "it satisfies the factorization property described below .",
    "the factorization property corresponds to degenerations of a surface of genus @xmath5 with @xmath8 marked points .",
    "first we consider the case when a surface degenerates into surfaces of genera @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 marked points respectively and that have a common point : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a basis in @xmath12 , @xmath22 is the inverse metric on @xmath12 written in this basis , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are some cycles in @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , @xmath27 is viewed as a cycle in @xmath14 via the embedding @xmath28 .",
    "then we consider the degeneration of a curve of genus @xmath5 into a curve of genus @xmath29 with a double point . in this case",
    "the factorization property means @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a cycle in @xmath32 considered also as a cycle in @xmath14 via the natural mapping @xmath33 .      in this and in the next subsections",
    "we assume some knowledge of conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "reader that does not know cft may skip this subsection and proceed to subsection  [ zwiebach ] where we formalize insights coming from cft .",
    "consider cft with odd symmetry .",
    "this means that the space of local observables @xmath34 is a complex with the differential @xmath9 , correlators satisfy @xmath35 both holomorphic and antiholomorphic energy - momentum tensors are @xmath9-exact @xmath36 and the fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 do not have singularities in their mutual operator product .",
    "consider the correlators @xmath39 as differential @xmath40-forms on the moduli space @xmath41 of riemann surfaces with germs of local coordinates at marked points @xmath42 .",
    "this means that we can contract such a form with a holomorphic ( and antiholomorphic ) vectors , tangent to the moduli space .",
    "a holomorphic tangent vector is determined by a beltrami differential ; so we can multiply @xmath37 by the beltrami differential and integrate over the surface .",
    "if @xmath8 is not zero one can also multiply @xmath37 by a holomorphic vector field in the neibourhood of a marked point and integrate around it .",
    "similarly , one can define contraction with an antiholomorphic tangent vector .",
    "this differential form descends down to the moduli space @xmath43 if the correlator contains only the first order poles when @xmath44 and @xmath45 approach the set of the marked points .",
    "the second order pole in operator product expansion between @xmath37 and @xmath46 is called the action of the operator @xmath47 on @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath48 .",
    "only the phase of the local coordinate corresponds to the noncontractable piece of the structure group of the bundle of germs of local coordinates over the moduli space of complex structures with the marked points .",
    "therefore we only have to impose the condition @xmath49 in order to get closed forms on the moduli space we impose @xmath50    finally , we need ( and this part of construction is missing in @xcite ) our differential form to be extendable to the deligne - mumford compactification of the moduli space .",
    "one can show that this is satisfied if the fields @xmath46 that are in the image of @xmath51 are not in the kernel of @xmath52 ; here @xmath53 and @xmath54 .      in the previous subsection we outlined the construction of amplitudes in an arbitrary topological conformal theory .",
    "however , in the so called degenerating theories ( like type @xmath3 theory on calaby - yau at the infinite volume limit ) life simplifies a bit , and the construction of amplitudes can be encoded in a tractable linear algebra data .    by a degenerating theory",
    "we mean a family of theories parametrized by a parameter @xmath55 such that at @xmath56 the subset @xmath57 of fields has zero conformal dimension : @xmath58 in some cases ( in particular , in the type @xmath3 example ) one can check that in this limit most of the correlators  ( [ cf ] ) vanish over the bounded domain of moduli of complex structures .",
    "however , this does not mean that the integrals over the moduli space vanish .",
    "what really happens is the following : the support of the correlation function moves towards the region where surface degenerates .",
    "the good model of this phenomena is the ordinary integral : @xmath59 the value of this integral is independent of @xmath55 while the integrand tends to zero as @xmath55 goes to zero .",
    "the support of the integrad is at @xmath60 of order @xmath61 .",
    "thus we have a contribution from the boundary of the moduli space ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this contribution comes from the infinitely long tubes connecting components of the degenerating surface and equals to @xmath62 where @xmath63 note , that @xmath64 has a regular limit as @xmath55 tends to zero , since @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a projector to the space @xmath12 of zero modes of @xmath67 that presumably has a smooth limit as @xmath55 goes to zero .",
    "note , that @xmath12 is the limit of the kernel rather than the kernel of the limiting operator ( that coincides with @xmath68 ) .",
    "note , that the space @xmath68 is equipped with the bilinear pairing : given by the two - point function : @xmath69 since the conformal dimension of fields @xmath70 is zero , this correlation function is independent of the coordinates @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the rules for computation of the amplitude in the limiting theory .",
    "the contribution from the bulk of the moduli space is obtained by substitution of elements from @xmath12 . the contribution from the degenerated surfaces",
    "is given by the sum over graphs , such that @xmath72-vertices of the graphs are labeled by @xmath72-point correlation functions ( of different genera ) .",
    "a weight of a graph is given by the pairing between vertices , so - called propagators @xmath73 ( given by ( [ k ] ) ) that correspond to edges , and elements of @xmath12 that correspond to tails .",
    "pairing is performed with the help of the bilinear form defined in ( [ bp ] ) .",
    "note , that vertices are paired with @xmath51 closed vectors , therefore vertices correspond to horisontal invariant forms on components of the moduli space and can be integrated over it .",
    "we make an attempt to formalize this in the next subsection .      in this section ,",
    "we sketch the principal construction of zwiebach invariants that motivates our purely algebraic constructions in the rest of the paper .",
    "note , that part of this was already presented in the work of zwiebach  @xcite , but he missed the hodge condition . in different settings , but in a closed way , a piece of the algebraic structure that we finally get was also obtained in  @xcite .",
    "we consider the kimura - stasheff - voronov compactification @xmath74 of the moduli space of curves of genus @xmath5 with @xmath8 marked point .",
    "it is a real blow - up of @xmath14 ; we just remember the relative angles at double points .",
    "we can also choose an angle of the tangent vector at each marked point ; this way we get the principal @xmath75-bundle over @xmath74 .",
    "we denote the total space of this bundle by @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a bicomplex with two differentials denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath51 and with a scalar product @xmath77 invariant under the differentials : @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "below we consider the action of @xmath9 and @xmath80 on @xmath81 .",
    "we denote by @xmath82 and @xmath83 the action of @xmath9 and @xmath80 respectively on the @xmath72-th component of the tensor product .",
    "the zwiebach invariants is the set @xmath84 of @xmath81-valued differential forms on @xmath76 , satisfying the axioms :    1 .",
    "@xmath85 is ( graded ) symmetric under the interchange of factors in @xmath81 with the simultaneous renumeration of marked points ; 2 .",
    "@xmath85 is totally closed , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) ; 3 .",
    "@xmath85 is totally horizontal , @xmath88 for all @xmath89 ( we denote by @xmath90 the substitution of the vector field generating the action on @xmath76 of the @xmath72-th copy of @xmath91 ) and @xmath85 is invariant under the action of @xmath75 ; 4 .   @xmath92 is the factorizable set of maps ( cf .",

    "it is useful to rewrite the last two axioms in local charts .",
    "locally , @xmath76 is a product of @xmath74 and @xmath8 circles .",
    "then the horizontality axiom means that @xmath85 is represented as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is ( the pull - back of ) a form on @xmath74 and @xmath102 is the angle at the @xmath103-th marked point .",

    "\\tilde{c}_{g , n}|_{\\gamma_1}&=\\left [ \\left(1+d\\psi g_-^{(n+2)}\\right ) \\wedge \\tilde{c}_{g-1,n+2 } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath94 corresponds to the degeneration of the surface into two components , @xmath95 corresponds to the degeneration of a handle , @xmath105 denotes the relative angle at the double point , and @xmath96 $ ] denotes the contraction with the scalar product of the last factors in @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the first case and of the last two factors in @xmath99 in the second case .",
    "indeed , we just use that @xmath106 in the first case and @xmath107 in the second case .    note that below we usually use @xmath101 instead of @xmath85 just to make our calculations more transparent .",
    "zwiebach invariants on the bicomplex with zero differentials determine gromov - witten invariants .    indeed , in this case @xmath108 .",
    "together with the factorization property this means that @xmath92 is lifted from the the blowdown of kimura - stasheff - voronov spaces , i.e. it is determined by a set of continuous forms on deligne - mumford spaces .",
    "therefore , integrating these forms along cycles in @xmath14 we get gromov - witten invariants defined on the space dual to @xmath68",
    ".      induced zwiebach invariants are obtained by contraction of an acyclic subbicomplex of @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 such that @xmath111 and @xmath112 is an acyclic subbicomplex .",
    "we denote by @xmath113 the contraction operator .",
    "this means that @xmath114 , @xmath115 is the projection to @xmath112 along @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "we construct an induced zwiebach form @xmath118 ( or rather @xmath119 ) on a modification of @xmath74 .",
    "each degeneration of a curve gives us a boundary stratum @xmath120 that is a pricipal @xmath91 bundle over @xmath121 or @xmath122 ( @xmath123 exchanges the labels of the last two points ) . at each such component of the boundary we glue the cylinder @xmath124 $ ] such that @xmath120 in @xmath74",
    "is identified with @xmath125 in the cylinder .",
    "so , we take a form @xmath101 , restrict it to @xmath126 , and extend it to the cylinder glued at @xmath120 as the restriction to @xmath126 of @xmath127\\ ] ] in the first case of curve degeneration or @xmath128\\ ] ] in the second case of curve degeneration . here",
    "@xmath60 is a coordinate along cylinder and operators @xmath129 and @xmath113 in the formulas act at the same copy of @xmath68 as @xmath80 . in terms of @xmath85 , this is just the same contraction as in equations  ( [ c1 ] ) and  ( [ c2 ] ) , but the scalar product is defined as @xmath130 .",
    "now it is a starightforward calculation to check that the forms @xmath119 ( or @xmath118 ) are @xmath131-closed and satisfy the factorization property when restricted to the strata @xmath132 .",
    "this construction is not smooth and is defined not on @xmath74 , but on its extension .",
    "nevertheless , one can easily turn this into a clear mathematical theory .",
    "we sketch the required construction in the next subsection .      instead of zwiebach invariants on the spaces",
    "@xmath76 we can consider zwiebach invariants on the moduli spaces with cuffs .",
    "that is , at each boundary stratum of @xmath76 of codimension @xmath2 we glue the cylinder equal to this stratum multiplied by @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "then we consider the set of forms satisfying the same axioms as above , but we require the properties of horizontality and factorization on the `` @xmath134 '' ends of the glued cylinders .    thus we obtain a slight generalization of the notion of zwiebach invariants . if we have a system of zwiebach invariants on @xmath76 , then we can lift it to cuffs .",
    "we just take the pull - backs of these forms under the mapping that keeps the moduli spaces and projects all cylinders to their `` @xmath1 '' ends .    then , when we consider the induced zwiebach invariants , we glue new cylinders to the `` @xmath135 '' ends of the cuffs .",
    "thus , at each boundary stratum we have two consequently glued cylinders .",
    "so , we choose a certain mapping , which identifies two glued cylinders with one cylinder .",
    "then the theory of induced zwiebach invariants is again the theory of zwiebach invariants on the moduli spaces with cuffs .      in the hodge case ,",
    "we assume that @xmath136 .",
    "then the induced zwiebach invariants determine gromov - witten invariants obtained by integrals over the fundamental cycles .",
    "what we get is a sum over graphs with vertices marked by the initial zwiebach invariants ( or rather their integrals over the fundamental cycles ) , internal edges correspond to the contraction of outputs with the scalar product @xmath137 , and tails are marked by the elements of @xmath116 .    in this paper , we study the case where the unique nonvanishing integral of the initial zwiebach invariants over the fundamental cycles exists for @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "there are some obstruction for the existence of such initial zwiebach invariants .",
    "we study them in the next subsection      first , we choose @xmath140 .",
    "it is a @xmath141-valued constant , so it determines a commutative multiplication on @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath140 is @xmath9-closed , we have the leibnitz rule : @xmath142 .",
    "now we try to choose @xmath143 . from the factorization property",
    ", it follows that @xmath143 is a sum of @xmath1-form and @xmath2-form .",
    "it is @xmath131-exact .",
    "so , comparing values of the @xmath1-form at two different boundary cycles of @xmath144 , we obtain that our multiplication is homotopy associative , that is , @xmath145 .",
    "another relation comes from an attempt to glue the @xmath2-forms arising on the boundary of @xmath144 due to the factorization property .",
    "consider the total space @xmath146 .",
    "there are @xmath147 distinguished @xmath2-cycles , determined by the action of @xmath91 at marked point and at double points .",
    "if we take an @xmath148-valued component of @xmath85 , then from the factorization property , if follows that the integrals over these cycles are equal to @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( the cycles corresponding to marked points are taken in the fiber over one of the boundary points ) . a path along each cycle can be obtained as a dehn twist along the corresponding cycle on a surface with @xmath151 marked points . the relation among these dehn twists",
    "@xcite imply that there is a @xmath6-dimensional surface in @xmath146 , whose boundary is the sum of these seven @xmath2-cycles , and this gives us the @xmath147-term relation up to homotopy : @xmath152    now we try to choose @xmath153 .",
    "the dehn twists along the cycles on a genus @xmath2 surface with marked point also give us a new relation .",
    "there are three cycles , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the basis in the first homology group of a torus , and @xmath154 is the cycle around the marked point . if @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the corresponding dehn twists , then @xmath158=[d_y^{-1}]$ ] in the homology of @xmath159 , and @xmath160 in the mapping class group  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we obtain that the kernel of the linear function @xmath161 contains the kernel of @xmath9 .",
    "here @xmath162 denotes the supertrace , and @xmath163 ( resp . , @xmath164 )",
    "is the operator of multiplication by @xmath165 ( resp . , @xmath166 ) .    from  @xcite",
    "it follows that no other relations can come from the relations among dehn twists .",
    "but of course there can be other obstructions of different geometric origin .",
    "we are grateful to e.  getzler for the explanation of the geometric origin of the @xmath147-term relation and @xmath0-axiom .",
    "the simplest solutions to the relations presented in the previous subsection are known as differential gerstenhaber - batalin - vilkovisky ( dgbv ) algebras , see  @xcite",

    "in this appendix , we explain how one can reformulate the results of barannikov and kontsevich in terms of graphs just by studying the bcov - action proposed in the appendix of their paper  @xcite .        here",
    "@xmath382 , @xmath383 , and @xmath384 are certain symmetric @xmath2- , @xmath6- , and @xmath202-forms respectively , and @xmath385 is a nondegenerate scalar product .",
    "we denote by @xmath386 the inverse bivector of @xmath385 .",
    "our goal is to obtain a critical point of @xmath387 and the critical value at this point as a formal power series in @xmath388 .",
    "we consider the sum of rooted trees without leaves .",
    "we suppose that there are vertices of degree @xmath2 , @xmath6 , and @xmath202 , and the root is the vertex of degree @xmath2 . at each vertex",
    "( except the root ) of degree @xmath103 we put the @xmath103-form @xmath388 . at each edge",
    "we put the bivector @xmath386 .",
    "then , substituting the bivectors into the form according to the graph , we get a vector at the root .",
    "we also weight each graph with the inversed order of its automorphism group .",
    "now we consider the sum over trees without leaves and without a root .",
    "we suppose that there are vertices of degree @xmath2 , @xmath6 , and @xmath202 , and the root is the vertex of degree @xmath2 . at each vertex of degree @xmath103",
    "we put the @xmath103-form @xmath388 . at each edge",
    "we put the bivector @xmath386 . substituting the bivectors into the form according to the graph",
    ", we get a number . as usual , we weight each graph with the inversed order of its automorphism group .",
    "barannikov and kontsevich formulate and prove both propositions without using the representations of @xmath120 and @xmath222 in terms of graphs .",
    "however , these representations exist and are naturally provided by the linear algebra formalism explained in the section  [ sums - over - trees ] .",
    "let us demonstrate this .",
    "the graph representation of @xmath222 is a direct corollary of the graph representation of @xmath120 . in order to obtain the graph representation of @xmath120 ,",
    "we rewrite @xmath387 as @xmath396    we recall that @xmath397 .",
    "in fact , the scalar product @xmath398 is nondegenerate only on @xmath399 .",
    "so there exists the bivector @xmath386 inversed to @xmath385 .",
    "we note that if we apply @xmath80 to the both components of @xmath386 , then we obtain the bivector @xmath204 $ ] .",
    "now we consider the sum over the rooted trees discussed in the section  [ sums - over - trees ] .",
    "we have : @xmath400 , @xmath401 , and @xmath402 .",
    "we see that we can move @xmath80 from vertices to edges .",
    "then , if we consider the sum over rooted trees with one additional @xmath80 at the root , we obtain the following :    1 .   at edges we put the bivector",
    "@xmath204 $ ] .",
    "2 .   at vertices of degree @xmath202",
    "we put the @xmath202-form @xmath403 .",
    "3 .   at vertices of degree @xmath6",
    "we put the @xmath6-form @xmath404 , i.e. we view it as the vertex of degree @xmath202 with one leaf marked by @xmath224 .",
