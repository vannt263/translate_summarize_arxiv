    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) is the creation , via interactions with the gauge field alone , of a fermion mass gap : whose magnitude exceeds , perhaps by a great amount , the mass - scale in the action set by the fermion s bare mass ; and which persists when that bare - mass - scale vanishes , namely , in the chiral limit .",
    "it is fundamentally important in strong interaction physics .",
    "for example , dcsb is responsible for the generation of large constituent - like masses for dressed - quarks in qcd , an outcome that could have been anticipated from refs.@xcite ; it is a longstanding prediction of dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) studies @xcite and has recently been observed in numerical simulations of lattice - regularised qcd @xcite .",
    "dcsb is also the keystone in the realisation of goldstone s theorem through pseudoscalar mesons in qcd @xcite , and thereby the remarkably small value of the ratio of @xmath2- and @xmath3-meson masses , and the weak @xmath4 interaction at low energies @xcite .",
    "a large body of efficacious qcd phenomenology is built on an appreciation of the importance of dcsb .",
    "that is evident in studies based on four - fermion interaction models @xcite and in dse applications @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , not all facets of dcsb have been elucidated .",
    "herein we describe novel aspects of the interplay between explicit and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "dcsb can be explored via the gap equation ; viz . , the dse for the dressed - fermion self - energy , which for a given quark flavour in qcd is expressed @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents a poincar invariant regularisation of the integral , with @xmath7 the regularisation mass - scale @xcite , @xmath8 is the dressed - gluon propagator , @xmath9 is the dressed - quark - gluon vertex , and @xmath10 is the quark s @xmath7-dependent bare current - mass .",
    "the quark - gluon - vertex and quark wave function renormalisation constants , @xmath11 , depend on the renormalisation point , @xmath12 , the regularisation mass - scale and the gauge parameter .",
    "the solution of the gap equation can be written in the following equivalent forms : @xmath13 ( nb .  the mass function , @xmath14 , is independent of the renormalisation point . )",
    "it is obtained from eq.([gendse ] ) augmented by the renormalisation condition @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the renormalised ( running ) mass : @xmath17 with @xmath18 the lagrangian - mass renormalisation constant . in qcd",
    "the chiral limit is strictly and unambiguously defined by @xcite @xmath19 which states that the renormalisation - point - invariant current - quark mass @xmath20 .",
    "qcd s action is chirally invariant in the chiral limit .",
    "consider a global chiral transformation applied to one particular flavour of quark , characterised by an angle @xmath21 . under this operation",
    "the quark s propagator is modified : @xmath22 suppose dcsb takes place so that @xmath23",
    ". then , with the choice @xmath24 , eq.([chiralt ] ) corresponds to mapping @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath26 is a solution of the gap equation in the chiral limit , then so is @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "while these two solutions are distinct , the chiral symmetry entails that each yields the same pressure @xcite .",
    "hence they correspond to equivalent vacua .",
    "this is an analogue of the chiral - limit equivalence between the @xmath28 and vacua in the linear - sigma - model , as elucidated in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is notable that , more generally , given a solution of the @xmath29 gap equation characterised by @xmath30 , then @xmath31 is a solution of the gap equation obtained with @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "studies of dcsb have hitherto focused on a positive definite solution of the gap equation because the introduction of a positive current - quark bare - mass favours this solution ; viz .",
    ", if another solution exists , then it has a lower pressure .",
    "returning again to the sigma - model analogy , such a bare - mass tilts the so - called wine - bottle potential , producing a global minimum at @xmath28 .",
    "however , whether the massive gap equation admits solutions other than that which is positive definite , the effect of the current - quark mass on such solutions , and their interpretation , are questions little considered .",
    "to begin addressing these questions , we first consider the simple example defined by eqs.([gendse ] ) , ( [ gensigma ] ) with the following forms for the dressed - gluon propagator and quark - gluon vertex : @xmath33 wherein @xmath34 is some `` gluon '' mass - scale and @xmath35 serves as a cutoff @xcite .",
    "the model thus obtained is not renormalisable so that the regularisation scale @xmath35 , upon which all calculated quantities depend , plays a dynamical role and the renormalisation constants can be set to one . in the model thus defined the gap equation is @xmath36    this gap equation s solution is @xmath37 and , a constant which satisfies @xmath38 \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath35 defines the mass - scale in a nonrenormalisable model , we can set @xmath39 and hereafter interpret all other mass - scales as being expressed in units of @xmath35 , whereupon the gap equation becomes @xmath40    equation  ( [ pgapnjl ] ) admits a @xmath41 solution when @xmath42 if and only if @xmath43 namely , it supports dcsb in this case .",
    "hence , to proceed we choose @xmath44 nb .  for @xmath45",
    "the only solution of the gap equation is one that may be obtained via a perturbative expansion in the coupling and hence dcsb is impossible .",
    "that domain is therefore not of interest herein .",

    "one reads from the figure that in the chiral limit there are three solutions to the gap equation : @xmath51 @xmath52 describes a realisation of chiral symmetry in the wigner mode .",
    "it corresponds to the vacuum configuration in which the possibility of dcsb is not realised ; i.e. , @xmath53 in the sigma - model analogy . in the chiral limit",
    "this is the only solution accessible via a perturbative expansion in the coupling .",
    "the solutions @xmath54 are essentially nonperturbative .",
    "they represent the realisation of chiral symmetry in the nambu - goldstone mode ; namely , dcsb .",
    "it is apparent in fig.[fignjl ] that with the gap equation obtained via eqs.([dnjl ] ) , ( [ gnjl ] ) , each of the solutions identified in eq.([gapsolnjl ] ) evolves smoothly with current - quark mass on a neighbourhood of @xmath42 .",
    "we subsequently consider the manner in which these solutions evolve as @xmath10 is increased from zero . in that discussion",

    "instead , these solutions exist on a domain @xmath57 @xmath58 also evolve smoothly with @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , at the critical current - quark mass , @xmath59 , these two solutions coalesce .    to understand the origin of a critical mass we observe from eq.([pgapnjl ] ) and fig.[fignjl ] that introducing a current - quark mass merely produces a constant pointwise negative shift in the curve @xmath46 .",

    "the procedure is straightforward but we stopped at @xmath73 because the magnitude of the coefficients grows rapidly with @xmath63 ; e.g. , @xmath74 , and this order was sufficient for our purpose .",

    "the evolution of each with current - quark mass is depicted in fig.[figbarm ] .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath86 is continuous on @xmath83 and evolves from the dcsb solution with increasing @xmath10 : @xmath91 is a monotonically decreasing function .",
    "these features can be understood as illustrating that the essentially dynamical component of chiral symmetry breaking decreases with increasing current - quark mass .",
    "this has also been argued via the constituent - quark @xmath92-term ; e.g. , in sec.5.2.2 of ref.@xcite .",

    "we now return to the critical current - quark mass , eq.([mbmcr ] ) , ( [ radiusc ] ) . in the neighbourhood of @xmath42 , @xmath95 viz .",
    ", @xmath96 can be expressed as a power series in @xmath10 around its chiral limit value , where that value is perturbative in the coupling . however , with increasing current - quark mass @xmath52 decreases steadily toward @xmath84 , which is nonzero in the chiral limit and essentially nonperturbative in the coupling , until at @xmath59 , @xmath97 . at this point a solution whose small current - quark mass behaviour is essentially perturbative has melded with a solution that is inaccessible in perturbation theory and actually characteristic of dcsb .",
    "a related view sees @xmath84 as a dcsb solution whose modification by a current - quark mass can no longer be evaluated as a power series in @xmath10 when that mass exceeds @xmath59 .",
    "finally , a chiral expansion of @xmath56 can only converge for current - quark masses less than @xmath59 .",
    "these observations suggest that @xmath59 specifies the upper bound on the domain within which , for physically relevant quantities , a perturbative expansion in the current - quark mass around their chiral limit values can be valid ; i.e. , it is a ( possibly weak ) upper bound on the radius of convergence .",
    "this view and the numerical result in eq.([mbmcr ] ) coincide with ref.@xcite .",

    "the first term in @xmath111 is a model for the long - range behaviour of the interaction .",
    "it is a finite width representation of the form introduced in ref.@xcite , which has been rendered as an integrable regularisation of @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "this interpretation , when combined with the result that in a heavy - quark  heavy - antiquark bse the rgi ladder truncation is exact @xcite , is consistent with @xmath111 leading to a richardson - like potential @xcite between static sources .",
    "the true parameters in eq.([gk2 ] ) are @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which together determine the integrated infrared strength of the rainbow kernel . however , they are not independent @xcite : in fitting to a selection of ground - state observables , a change in one is compensated by altering the other ; e.g. , on the interval @xmath115\\,$]gev , the fitted observables are approximately constant along the trajectory @xcite @xmath116 equation ( [ gk2 ] ) is thus a one - parameter model .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that because the truncation preserves the one - loop renormalisation group properties of qcd the ultraviolet behaviour of the solutions of eqs.([gendse ] ) and ( [ rainbowdse ] ) is precisely that of qcd .",

    "we stress that a straightforward definition of a massive - quark condensate via the trace of a @xmath169 dressed - quark propagator is not useful because it gives a quantity that is quadratically divergent and therefore very difficult to define unambiguously .",
    "the same weakness afflicts the quantity @xmath170 where @xmath171.\\ ] ]    the discussion in refs.@xcite provides a context for eqs.([barsigma ] )  ( [ checks ] ) , and a connection between our reasoning and that used in other frameworks to calculate the quark condensate .",
    "on a bounded interval of current - quark mass , @xmath172 , realistic models of qcd s gap equation can simultaneously admit two inequivalent dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) solutions for the dressed - quark mass - function , @xmath153 , and a solution that is unambiguously connected with the realisation of chiral symmetry in the wigner mode , @xmath143 .",
    "the dcsb solutions are distinguished by their value at the origin : @xmath173 and @xmath174 . in the ultraviolet",
    "all three solutions coincide with the running current - quark mass .",
    "the pointwise values of all solutions evolve continuously with current - quark mass within @xmath175 .",
    "however , things change at the upper boundary . the @xmath52 solution ,",
    "whose chiral limit value is perturbative in the coupling , becomes identical to the essentially nonperturbative solution @xmath84 that is actually characteristic of dcsb .",
    "moreover , both disappear for @xmath168 , a domain whereupon the current - quark mass is large enough to completely destabilise these solutions . only the positive @xmath56 solution exists on this domain .",
    "furthermore , we provided evidence that the upper boundary of @xmath175 also defines the radius of convergence for an expansion of @xmath56 in current - quark mass around its dcsb chiral - limit form .",
    "thus one has the coalescing of two qualitatively distinct solutions at @xmath139 , the persistence of only one essentially nonperturbative solution for @xmath168 plus the breakdown of a chiral expansion for this solution , and the simultaneous loss of a well - defined mass - dependent quark condensate .",
    "this behaviour supports an interpretation of @xmath139 as the upper bound on the domain within which a perturbative expansion of physical quantities in the current - quark mass around their chiral - limit values can uniformly be valid . in a phenomenologically efficacious renormalisation - group - improved rainbow - ladder truncation of qcd s dyson - schwinger equations",
    ", the critical current - quark mass corresponds to a mass @xmath0gev ( ) for a pseudoscalar meson constituted of equal mass current - quarks @xcite .",
    "nb .  irrespective of the current - mass of the other constituent , a meson containing one current - quark",
    "whose mass exceeds @xmath139 is never within the domain of uniform convergence .",
    "a value of similar magnitude was deduced in refs.@xcite as the scale below which accuracy may be expected from the approximation of observables through a perturbative expansion in pion - like pseudoscalar - meson mass .",
    "this scale also marks the boundary below which observables should exhibit that curvature as a function of pion - like pseudoscalar - meson mass which is characteristic of chiral effective theories .",
