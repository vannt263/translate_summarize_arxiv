    "no matter how one looks at it , the third generation in the standard model ( sm ) is special .",
    "( the 3rd generation fermions may provide a clue to the origin of mass , fourth generation , etc . )",
    "this is even more so in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where the third generation superpartners are singled out in several ways .",
    "first , their larger yukawa couplings tend to drive the corresponding soft scalar masses smaller through the rge evolution .",
    "second , they play an important role in triggering radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , and as a result , fine - tuning arguments suggest that they are probably lighter than the other two generations @xcite . finally , squark and slepton mixing for the third generation is typically rather large and further decreases the mass of the lightest mass eigenstates .",
    "for all of these reasons , it is possible that the third generation squarks and sleptons could be relatively light and therefore more easily accessible at the current and future colliders .",
    "then , a logical thing to do will be to study particular signatures involving their decay products - top and bottom quarks , and tau leptons or neutrinos .",
    "of these four , the tau leptons appear as the most promising possibility at the tevatron .",
    "tau neutrinos are invisible , and they often come paired with tau leptons anyway . signatures with b - jets are also promising , but they tend to have large qcd backgrounds . and finally , top quarks are heavy , which limits the tevatron reach for those channels",
    ".    searches for supersymmetry ( susy ) in run i of the tevatron have been done exclusively in channels involving some combination of leptons , jets , photons and missing transverse energy ( @xmath0 ) @xcite . at the same time , several run i analyses have identified hadronic tau jets in the most abundant standard model processes , e.g. in @xmath1-production @xcite and top decays @xcite .",
    "hadronically decaying taus have also been used to place limits on a charged higgs @xcite and leptoquarks @xcite .",
    "since tau identification is expected to improve further in run ii , this raises the question whether susy searches in channels involving tau jets are feasible .",
    "susy signatures with tau leptons are very well motivated , since they arise in a variety of models of low - energy supersymmetry , e.g. gravity mediated ( sugra ) @xcite or the minimal gauge mediated ( mgm ) models @xcite .",
    "here we present results from a study @xcite of all possible _ experimental _ signatures with three identified objects ( leptons or tau jets ) plus @xmath0 , and compare their reach to the clean trilepton channel @xcite . in evaluating",
    "the physics potential of the future tevatron runs in these new tau channels , it is important to be aware not only of the physical backgrounds , but also of the experimental realities .",
    "jets faking taus will comprise a significant fraction of the background , and it is crucial to have a reliable estimate of that rate , which we attempt to estimate from a detailed monte carlo analysis .",
    "we used pythia @xcite and tauola @xcite for event generation , and the shw package @xcite , which provides a realistic run ii detector simulation .    in the next section",
    "we delineate the relevant parameter space regions of the minimal sugra and mgm models , where one may expect enhanced tau signals .",
    "we then discuss in rather general terms the pros and cons of the tau jet channels . later in section  [ sec : analysis ] we describe in detail our analysis and present our cut selection . in section  [ sec : backgrounds ] we discuss the major sm backgrounds , and in section  [ sec : triggering ] we perform a study on triggering in those new channels . finally in section",
    "[ sec : reach ] we show the expected run ii tevatron reach for the scenario under consideration .",
    "most people would probably agree that our best bet to discover supersymmetry at the tevatron is the clean @xmath2 channel .",
    "it arises in the decays of gaugino - like chargino - neutralino pairs @xmath3 .",
    "the reach is somewhat limited by the rather small leptonic branching fractions of the chargino and neutralino . in the limit of either heavy or equal in mass squarks and sleptons ,",
    "the leptonic branching ratios are @xmath1-like and @xmath4-like , respectively . however , both gravity mediated and gauge mediated models of susy breaking allow the sleptons to be much lighter than the squarks , thus enhancing the leptonic branching fractions of the gauginos .",
    "what is more , in certain regions of parameter space the lightest tau slepton can be much lighter than the other sleptons , and then the gaugino decays will proceed predominantly to final states with tau leptons only .",
    "there are various generic reasons as to why one may expect light sleptons in the spectrum .",
    "for example , the slepton masses at the high - energy ( gut or messenger ) scale may be rather small to begin with .",
    "this is typical for gauge mediated models , since the sleptons are colorless and do not receive large soft mass contributions @xmath5 .",
    "the minimal sugra models , on the other hand , predict light sleptons in the region of parameter space where @xmath6 .",
    "various effects ( non - flat kahler metric , rge running above the gut scale , d - terms from extra @xmath7 gauge factors ) may induce nonuniversalities in the scalar masses at the gut scale , in which case the slepton - squark mass hierarchy can be affected . in the absence of a specific model , we do not know which way the splittings will go , but as long as the soft scalar masses are small , the rge running down to the weak scale will naturally induce a splitting between the squarks and sleptons , making the sleptons lighter .",
    "now , given that the sleptons are the lightest scalars in the spectrum , it is quite plausible that by far the lightest among them are the third generation sleptons . as we mentioned in section",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , rge running and mixing in the charged slepton sector may push the stau masses down .    as a result of some or all of these effects , it may very well be that among all scalars , only the lightest sleptons from each generation ( or maybe just the lightest stau @xmath8 ) are lighter than @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , in both sugra and minimal gauge mediated models one readily finds regions of parameter space where either @xmath11 ( typically at small @xmath12 ) or @xmath13 ( at large @xmath12 ) .",
    "depending on the particular model , and the values of the parameters , the gaugino pair decay chain may then end up overwhelmingly in _ any one _ of the four final states : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "( from now on , we shall use the following terminology : a `` lepton '' ( @xmath18 ) is either a muon or an electron ; a tau ( @xmath19 ) is a tau - lepton , which can later decay either leptonically , or to a hadronic tau jet , which we denote by @xmath20 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ sugra ] we show a scatter plot of sugra model points plotted versus the ratios @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( see @xcite for details on how the sampling was done ) .",
    "= 3.0 in    we concentrate on the region @xmath6 and show only points with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "( note that in sugra the lightest selectron or smuon is purely right - handed , while the lightest stau typically has a sizable left - handed component . )",
    "there are several distinct regions in relation to the branching ratios of the chargino - neutralino pair ( recall that in sugra @xmath25 ) :    * region i : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in this case , all two - body decays are closed , and the leptonic branching ratios of the gauginos are @xmath1-like ( @xmath4-like ) . * region ii : @xmath28 , but @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 .",
    "note that if the stau mass is too close to either @xmath31 or @xmath32 , at least one of the resulting taus will be quite soft .",
    "one would therefore expect the largest efficiency if @xmath33 .",
    "* region iii : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "then the gauginos can only decay to selectrons or smuons via two - body decays .",
    "note that @xmath36 is mostly @xmath37 , while @xmath38 is mostly @xmath39 , and those do not couple to right - handed squarks or sleptons .",
    "therefore the decay @xmath40 proceeds through the relatively small @xmath41 component of the @xmath42 , while the decay @xmath43 is severely suppressed by the small muon or electron yukawa couplings , and the three - body decays @xmath44 , @xmath45 become dominant .",
    "since those can also be mediated by an off - shell @xmath1 , we expect both of them to be present .",
    "notice how the assumption of generational independence of the scalar masses at the gut scale assures that @xmath46 , so that there are no sugra model points in region iii , but this can be avoided if one alows for different stau and first two generation slepton masses at the gut scale @xcite . *",
    ": @xmath35 and @xmath29 , so that the signatures from both regions ii and iii can be present . now , the trilepton signal is somewhat suppressed , since the chargino decays mostly to taus .",
    "* region v : @xmath47 .",
    "here one finds a charged lsp ( stau ) , which is stable , if r - parity is conserved , and therefore excluded cosmologically . *",
    "region vi : @xmath48",
    ". this region is excluded for the same reason as region v , since now the smuon is the lsp .    to summarize , in sugra models , on most general grounds we expect chargino - neutralino pair production to give rise to @xmath17 , @xmath49 or @xmath14 final states , where the first two can be dominant in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "we next consider the minimal gauge mediated models ( we follow the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and show the corresponding scatter plot in fig .",
    "[ gm ] .",
    "= 3.0 in    our discussion of regions i - iv above applies here as well .",
    "the novel feature is that now the goldstino @xmath50 is the lsp , and therefore regions v and vi are in principle allowed .",
    "we do indeed find points in those regions , but only if @xmath51 .",
    "this is again a consequence of the generation independence of the scalar masses at the messenger scale , which is a robust prediction of the minimal gauge - mediated models . in order to avoid this argument",
    ", one would have to allow for messenger - matter mixing and arrange for different couplings of the messengers to the three families .",
    "a very interesting situation may arise in the intersection of regions v and vi .",
    "if the mass splitting between @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 is very small ( i.e. at rather small values of @xmath12 ) , they may all be co - nlsp s .",
    "just as before , @xmath55 will preferentially decay to taus : @xmath56 .",
    "the neutralino decays , however , are of two sorts : @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 stands for the very soft products of the selectron ( or smuon ) decay to a stau .",
    "the typical signature in this case would be @xmath61 .",
    "the above discussion of the two most popular supersymmetric models reveals that , depending on the model parameters , the gaugino decay chains may overwhelmingly end up in any one of the four final states @xmath17 , @xmath61 , @xmath49 and @xmath14 . in order to decide as to which experimental signatures are most promising , we have to first factor in the tau branching ratios to leptons and jets .",
    "about two - thirds of the subsequent tau decays are hadronic , so it appears advantageous to consider signatures with tau jets in the final state as alternatives to the clean trilepton signal .",
    "the branching ratios for three leptons or undecayed taus into a final state containing leptons and tau jets is shown in table  [ tau_branching ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we can see that across the board the three very simplified triggers did a very good job and typically picked up about 90% of the signal events which contained at least one lepton .",
    "we also checked if we can use the tau trigger in shw ( which is calorimetry - based and probably not the most suitable trigger for our purposes @xcite ) to collect some of the remaining events .",
    "we considered the effect of a mixed @xmath62 trigger and found only some marginal improvement of a few percent .",
    "the only case , in which a new trigger helps a lot is the jetty channel @xmath63 , where it is a @xmath64 and not @xmath65 trigger which is relevant .",
    "however , developing a stand - alone hadronic double tau trigger does not seem well justified  the fake rate for qcd jets faking taus is large enough to make the trigger fire mostly on pure qcd events , where two jets are faking taus . in order to even entertain the idea of a double tau trigger",
    ", one would have to think seriously about adding an extra requirement , for example @xmath0 , but then the trigger becomes too complicated . besides , it helps a lot only for the channel with the worst reach ( and largest backgrounds ) .",
    "it may in fact be a better idea to lower the threshold of the @xmath0 trigger instead .",
    "a @xmath66 exclusion limit would require a total integrated luminosity @xmath67 notice that @xmath68 depends linearly on the background @xmath69 after cuts , but _ quadratically _ on the signal branching ratios .",
    "this allows the jetty channels to compete very successfully with the clean trilepton signature , whose branching ratio is quite small ( see table  [ tau_branching ] ) .      in fig .",
    "[ reach ] we show the tevatron reach in the three channels : trileptons ( blue ) , dileptons plus a tau jet ( red ) and like - sign dileptons plus a tau jet ( green ) .",
    "we see that the two channels with tau jets have a much better sensitivity compared to the usual trilepton signature . assuming that efficient triggers can be implemented",
    ", the tevatron reach will start exceeding lep ii limits as soon as run iia is completed and the two collaborations have collected a total of @xmath70 of data . considering the intrinsic difficulty of the susy scenario we are contemplating , the mass reach for run iib is quite impressive .",
    "one should also keep in mind that we did not attempt to optimize our cuts for the new channels . for example , one could use angular correlation cuts to suppress drell - yan , transverse @xmath1 mass cut to suppress @xmath71 @xcite , or ( chargino ) mass  dependent @xmath72 cuts for the leptons and tau jets @xcite , to squeeze out some extra reach . in addition , the @xmath73 channel can be explored at smaller values of @xmath12 as well @xcite , since the two - body chargino decays are preferentially to tau sleptons . in that case , the clean trilepton channel still offers the best reach , and a signal can be observed already in run iia .",
    "then , the tau channels will not only provide an important confirmation , but also hint towards some probable values of the susy model parameters .",
