    "high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are a class of binary system that consist of a compact object ( either a black hole or a neutron star ) and a massive stellar companion and emit in x - rays . the current generation of imaging atmospheric - cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) has facilitated the study of hmxbs which exhibit tev emission .",
    "the class of tev binaries is quite sparse , consisting of only a handful of sources : psr b1259 - 63 , ls 5039 @xcite , ls  i  + 61@xmath0  303 @xcite , hess j0632 + 057 , and 1fgl j1018.6 - 5856 @xcite .",

    "only the compact objects of psr b1259 - 63 and tev 2032 + 413 have been firmly identified as pulsars .",
    "there is still a large degree of ambiguity concerning the nature of the compact object within the other systems .",
    "consequently , the fundamental mechanism responsible for the tev emission remains uncertain .",
    "the orbital periods of tev - emitting hmxbs vary from several days ( ls 5039 ) to many years ( tev 2032 + 413 ) .",
    "as the tev emission varies strongly as a function of the orbital phase , the various sources may only have short windows during which they can be detected in the tev regime .",

    "the observed multiwavelength emission is variable at all energies and modulated with a period of @xmath4 days , believed to be associated with the orbital motion of the binary system .",
    "shorter timescale variability has also been detected in x - rays @xcite and hinted at in the tev range @xcite .",
    "additionally , the source exhibits a periodic superorbital modulation with a period of @xmath5 years in h@xmath6 emission and in radio @xcite , x - ray @xcite , and gev @xcite bands .",
    "this modulation could be attributed to precessing relativistic jets if the compact object is a black hole or to cyclic variations of the b0 ve star envelope if the compact object is a neutron star .",

    "however , the strong statistical indication of nightly variability and the sharp transition from a flux upper limit to a significantly detected flux over the course of 24 hours at the onset of f1 and f2 imply that the rise time of the flares is of the order of one day or less .",

    "the nature of the compact object inls  i  + 61@xmath0  303 is not firmly established and , as a result , proposed emission mechanisms for the system cover a range of possibilities .",
    "these mechanisms fall into two main categories : microquasar ( @xmath70q ) and pulsar binary ( pb ) . in the @xmath70q scenario ,",
    "non - thermal particle - acceleration processes occur in the jet of an accreting compact object ( see @xcite @xcite for a review , or @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; for the specific case of ls  i  + 61@xmath0  303 ) . the pulsar binary scenario utilizes the presence of a shocked wind in which particle acceleration is the result of the interaction between the stellar and the pulsar winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while some versions of both models utilize a hadronic primary population , the majority of both model types employ leptonic origins for the observed non - thermal emission . in a leptonic scenario ,",
    "the tev emission is the result of inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of electrons accelerated in the jet ( @xmath70q ) or at the shock front ( pb ) .",
    "@xcite present a general pulsar wind shock scenario with an inhomogeneous stellar wind in which the b0 ve star disc is disrupted and fragments .",
    "the resulting clumps of the disc fall into the shock region , pushing the shock closer to the pulsar .",
    "the reduction in size of the pulsar wind termination shock could allow for increased acceleration efficiency on the timescale of a few hours , depending on the size and density of the disc fragments .",
    "such a scenario could account for the exceptionally bright tev flares and orbit - to - orbit variations seen in ls  i  + 61@xmath0  303 .",
    "regardless of the primary mechanism to generate the emission , @xcite provide a prescription to calculate model - independent limits on the magnetic field strength and the efficiency of the accelerator within an ic scenario .",
    "given the temperature @xmath71k of the b0 ve star in ls  i  + 61@xmath0  303 , the average energy of the stellar photons is @xmath72ev , and the ic scattering takes place deep in the klein - nishina regime , in which most of the electron energy is transferred to the scattered photons .",
    "thus , the presence of @xmath69tev photons requires electrons with an energy of at least @xmath67tev in the emitter , as well as forcing the acceleration time to be less than the cooling time .",
    "two example cases will be used in the following discussion : the conservative case of a 10tev electron which must be present in the emitter , and a more optimistic case of a 20tev electron as there is no evidence of a cutoff in the photon spectrum . following the calculations of @xcite",
    ", the acceleration timescale of the electrons can be expressed as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the larmor radius of the electron , @xmath75 is the energy of the electron in units of tev , @xmath76 is the magnetic field strength in units of gauss , and @xmath77 is a parameter describing the efficiency of the accelerator ( in general @xmath78 ) .",
    "the characteristic cooling time of electrons in the klein - nishina regime is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the energy density of the starlight close to the compact object in which @xmath81 is the luminosity of the optical star and @xmath82 is the distance between the emitter and the optical star .",
    "this distance can not be much more than the orbital distance as otherwise the periodic component of the emission would be washed out , therefore the emitting region is assumed to be located close to the compact object .",
    "the temperature @xmath83k and radius @xmath84 of the star in this system results in a total luminosity of @xmath85erg s@xmath33 .    the synchrotron cooling time is given by @xmath86 the relation @xmath87 can be set due to the fact that ic losses in the klein - nishina regime allow for the hard electron spectra ( harder than @xmath88 ) necessary to produce hard gamma - ray spectral indices ( from @xmath88 to @xmath89 )",
    "thus , the magnetic field in the emitter is constrained by the relation @xmath90 using @xmath91 gives a value of @xmath92 g and using @xmath93 results in @xmath94 g at apastron ( close to the position in the orbit at which the flares were detected ) .",
    "a fundamental condition is that the larmor radius of the electrons must be considerably less than the linear size of the emitter .",
    "as before , the distance between the compact object and the emitter is used as an estimate of the linear size of the emitter . rearranging equation  [ taccel ] to get @xmath95 and taking the ratio @xmath96",
    "gives a value of @xmath97 of the total system size at apastron at the upper limit of the magnetic field strength ( @xmath98 g ) in the case of 10tev electrons .",
    "the larmor radius of 20tev electrons is already @xmath99 of the system size at apastron at the upper limit of the magnetic field strength ( @xmath100 g ) . a lower magnetic field strength results in a larger larmor radius .",
    "given that the larmor radius is such a large fraction of total system size , the leakage time of the electrons ( not considered in this simple model ) may already be the shortest timescale of the system , especially for higher - energy electrons .",
    "the constraints are strongly dependent on the assumed location of the emitter , which has been taken to be coincident with the compact object in order to derive these limits .",
    "if the emitter is located farther from the star , the upper limit on the magnetic field is reduced even further and the orbital periodicity would be washed out .",
    "regardless of the location of the emitter , the simple klein - nishina scattering assumed in this discussion implies a very hard synchrotron spectrum in the x - ray band .",
    "if the same population of electrons that is responsible for the vhe emission also produces the x - ray emission , photon indices softer than 1.3 in the x - ray regime @xcite may challenge this simple scenario , which requires an electron spectral index harder than 2 to produce hard gamma - ray spectral indices .",
    "the veritas observations of the bright flares from ls  i  + 61@xmath0  303 in 2014 provide constraints on the physical properties of the system around the acceleration region .",
    "the upper limit derived on the magnetic field strength following the prescription of @xcite results in a larmor radius that is a sizeable fraction of the total system size .",
    "this implies that particle leakage from the system will be non - negligible , a problem that is not accounted for in the model .",
    "in addition , the hard electron spectral index required to produce the observed gamma - ray spectral indices results in some tension with the photon indices in the x - ray regime . both of these issues suggest that it is difficult for this type of simple model to reproduce the emission observed from the source",
    ". a beamed model could more easily account for the emission , hinting in favor of a @xmath70q scenario for ls  i  + 61@xmath0  303 , although a jet - like structure could also be produced in pb systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a @xmath70q scenario is also mildly favored by calculations of the mass of the compact object that place the minimum mass at about @xmath101 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are a number of insights that could aid in distinguishing between the @xmath70q and pb scenarios .",
    "high - resolution radio imaging could reveal extended jet - like structures that would point to a @xmath70q scenario .",
    "refined measurements of the orbital parameters of the system constraining the inclination angle and hence the mass of the system could clearly identify the compact object as a black hole if its mass were found to be @xmath102 .",

    "would indicate that the emission is related to changes in the circumstellar disk of the optical star .",
