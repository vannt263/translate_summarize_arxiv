    "the combination of advanced neurobiology and engineering creates a new pathway , namely a brain computer interface ( bci ) .",
    "the bci provides a bridge connecting the human brain to the outside world @xcite .",
    "this means that people do not have to rely on the conventional pathway of an intent initialized in the brain being passed to muscles through peripheral nerves , and are able to interact directly with the external environment @xcite . due to the lack of involvement of peripheral nerves and muscles , with the aid of a bci system",
    ", disabled people could restore their abilities of communication @xcite and the degenerated motor function @xcite . during the past two decades",
    ", a variety of bci systems have been created for different applications .",
    "these bci systems are generally divided into two types : active bci and passive bci , according to the level of interaction with external stimuli . in the case of a passive bci ,",
    "when using a steady - state visual evoked potential ( ssvep ) bci @xcite , the user may , for example , simply stare at an intended digital number shown on a screen to dial a phone number . when a steady - state flicker is replaced with an occasional flicker ,",
    "a different type of bci called p300 can be used to output letters by hierarchical selections @xcite .",
    "compared to the passive bci , the active bci is more natural .",
    "users can express their intents whenever they want to , rather than according to a predefined timing arrangement or external cooperation , as with the passive bci .",
    "for instance , people with paraplegia can regain movement in a wheelchair by motor imagery @xcite , or can control a computer cursor in virtual 2d @xcite or 3d @xcite environments through brain modulation .",
    "moreover , bci is also used to develop prostheses , with which disabled people can , for example , move an object @xcite or drink a cup of coffee @xcite .",
    "more recently , bci has been applied to facilitate rehabilitation @xcite .",
    "besides applications for disabled people , bci also has promising applications for healthy persons , especially in the field of entertainment .",
    "bci is employed to control video games instead of conventional inputs such as a keyboard and joystick @xcite . in this way",
    ", healthy people can enjoy the experience of manipulating virtual objects in a manner different from that used in daily life .",
    "+ from the application point of view , the user experience is very important .",
    "this requires smoothness in the manipulation of the bci system . in order to meet this requirement",
    ", the bci system needs to translate brain activities into output information continuously without any interruption . in other words",
    ", this requires all the eeg segments to be present for the decoding .",
    "if some of the eeg segments are discarded due to extreme noise contamination , the bci can not generate the corresponding output during that period .",
    "hence , it would be good to be able to utilize the remaining portion of the affected eeg segment , after only removing the part directly affected by noise .",
    "in general , spectral power features are usually utilized to distinguish different motor imageries ( e.g. , left - hand and right - hand motor imageries ) @xcite , as they are considered to be robust for the representation of the contents of motor imageries .",
    "if the segment is complete ( continuous ) , the fourier transform can be well used to transform temporal data points into the spectral domain .",
    "this fails in the case of incomplete data , such as an eeg segment with a portion ( or portions ) of data removed ( unevenly spaced ) . in order still to utilize such segments of eeg with arbitrary portions of data removed and",
    "provide users with an experience of smooth manipulation , we employ the lomb - scargle periodogram to estimate the spectral power @xcite , and denoising autoencoder ( dae ) @xcite based neural network or support vector machine ( svm ) @xcite to predict the classes of motor imageries .",
    "the results show that the proposed method is suitable for decoding incomplete eeg in a bci system .",
    "we first employed the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite to estimate band powers from incomplete eeg signals .",
    "next , the extracted features were used to train an unsupervised dae @xcite or a supervised svm with radial basis function ( rbf ) kernel @xcite . in the case of dae",
    ", the mapping weights of dae were used to initialize a neural network .",
    "after fine - tuning the weights , this trained neural network was used to recognize the classes of motor imageries .",
    "[ schematic ] illustrates the proposed method .",
    "a four - second trial is divided into 25 segments of one - second length with an overlap of 87.5% .",
    "a segment is denoted by @xmath0 , which is @xmath1 by @xmath2 matrix , where @xmath1 is the number of channels , and @xmath2 is the number of sampling points .",
    "the spectral power of each channel time series @xmath3 is estimated by the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite .",
    "the estimated spectral power at frequency @xmath4 can be obtained by minimizing the following sum of difference squares :    @xmath5\\hfill } \\;\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^t { { { ( y({t_i } ) - \\alpha \\cos ( { \\omega_f}{t_i } + \\phi ) ) } ^2}}\\;.\\ ] ]    let @xmath6 and @xmath7    we can then rewrite equation ( [ equation1 ] ) as : @xmath8 the optimal parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be obtained through minimizing equation ( [ equation4 ] ) @xmath11 = { r^ { - 1}}r,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 } \\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { \\cos ( { \\omega_f}{t_i})}&{\\sin ( { \\omega_f}{t_i } ) } \\end{array } } \\right],\\ ] ] and @xmath13 } \\;y({t_i})\\;.\\ ] ] the power of specific frequency @xmath4 is then estimated with respect to optimal parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 as follows : @xmath14\\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { \\cos ( \\omega{}_f{t_i})}\\\\ { \\sin ( \\omega{}_f{t_i } ) } \\end{array } } \\right ] } \\right ) } ^2}\\\\    \\quad = \\frac{1}{t}\\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { \\hat{a}}&{\\hat{b } } \\end{array } } \\right]\\;r\\;\\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { \\hat{a}}\\\\ { \\hat{b } } \\end{array } } \\right]\\\\   \\quad = \\frac{1}{t}{r^{\\rm t}}({\\omega_f}){r^ { - 1}}({\\omega_f})r({\\omega_f})\\;. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    similarly , the minimization of squares mentioned above is used to estimate spectral powers at all frequencies .",
    "after that , spectral estimation for one channel is completed .",
    "these steps are repeated for all channels and all segments to obtain the spectral powers .",
    "because the frequency range of 8 - 30 hz is mostly related to the motor imagery task @xcite , we divided this band into four subbands with a bandwidth of 5 hz ( i.e. , 8 - 12 hz , 13 - 17 hz , 18 - 22 hz , and 23 - 27 hz ) .",
    "subband powers were obtained by averaging spectral powers within the corresponding frequency band range for each channel .",
    "then , subband powers ( four features for each channel ) for all channels were concatenated into a feature vector : @xmath15^{\\rm t}}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the number of channels .",
    "subsequently , features were normalized as : @xmath16 the normalized features were then fed into a neural network with dae initialization , or into an svm classifier to distinguish which class the current eeg segment belongs to .      for a time , neural networks were less frequently used due to the drawback that they easily became stuck in the local minima , so more use was made of svm classifier . however , recently neural networks have regained popularity , in particular when using a pre - training strategy @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we construct a three - layer neural network with dae initialization ( a neural network with more layers might possibly achieve a better performance through in - depth feature learning ) .",
    "+ the power features extracted by lomb - scargle periodogram was first corrupted , denoted as @xmath17 , by means of a stochastic mapping @xmath18 .",
    "the part enclosed by the orange rectangle in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] shows a schematic diagram of the dae .",
    "we set the corrupted elements to 0 .",
    "then , the corrupted features were mapped to a hidden representation ( 120 units ) by the sigmoid function @xmath19 consequently , we reconstructed the uncorrupted @xmath20 as @xmath21 the objective was to train parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 for minimization of the average reconstruction error over a training set .",
    "in other words , to find the parameters to let @xmath20 be as close as possible to @xmath24 , we performed the following optimization : @xmath25 = \\mathop { \\arg \\min } \\limits_{\\theta , \\;{\\theta^{\\prime } } } \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n { l({f^{(i)}},\\;{z^{(i ) } } ) } \\\\",
    "\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad = \\mathop { \\arg \\min } \\limits_{\\theta , \\;{\\theta^{\\prime } } } \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^n { l({f^{(i)}},\\;{g_{2,\\;{\\theta^{\\prime}}}}({g_{1,\\;\\theta } } ( { \\hat{f}^{(i ) } } ) ) ) } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a squared error loss function @xmath27 , n is the number of training samples , and @xmath28 are the optimal values of @xmath29 .",
    "once the optimal parameters were obtained , we were able to use those parameters to initialize a neural network .",
    "a top layer was added onto the neural network .",
    "after that , the parameters were fine - tuned in a supervised way .",
    "two different categories of data are used to prove the feasibility of the proposed method .",
    "one is the simulated data and the other is the two - class motor imagery data .",
    "we use simulated data to illustrate systematically that spectral power can be correctly estimated when the data become unevenly spaced after removing some data points from them .",
    "further , we use real motor imagery data to demonstrate that classification accuracy does not dramatically decrease when increasing the percentage of data within the segment that has been removed , so that the proposed method is useful to process incomplete data in a bci system .",
    "+ the simulated data were generated by mixing two sinusoidal signals , which were 3 hz and 6 hz , respectively .",
    "the maximal amplitude of the 3 hz sinusoidal signal was 1.5 times that of the 6 hz sinusoidal signal .",
    "the motor imagery data came from three subjects .",
    "fourteen electrodes ( shown with a green background in the scalp illustration in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) were used to record the eeg signal on the sensorimotor cortex while the subject was conducting motor imagery at a sampling rate of 250 hz . those electrodes were referenced at the mastoids behind the ears and grounded at afz .",
    "each subject participated in four sessions .",
    "each session consisted of 15 trials , each of which was four seconds long .",
    "the subject conducted either left hand motor imagery or right hand motor imagery according to the cue shown on the computer monitor .",
    "we first evaluated the performance of the spectral power estimation on simulated data .",
    "the simulated data was mixed with two sinusoidal signals , which were 3 hz and 6 hz , respectively .",
    "the spectral power estimated from the complete signal , and the incomplete signals with different proportional removal of data points ( from 10% to 80% with an interval of 10% ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ simulatedplot ] .",
    "the data points were removed at random . in order to keep the same scale over cases with different proportional data removal to facilitate comparisons between them , the powers shown in fig .",
    "[ simulatedplot ] were normalized by dividing by a proportional factor ( 1-p , where p is the percentage of data removed ) .",
    "for example , the estimated power is divided by a factor of 0.7 when 30% of data points are removed from the signal . from fig .",
    "[ simulatedplot ] , we can see that the components at 3 hz and 6 hz can be well estimated in all cases with different proportions of data removal , even up to removal of 80% of data points .          in general",
    ", bci encounters a common problem that there is no output when the whole segment has to be discarded due to partial noise contamination in that segment .",
    "if a method can obtain comparable recognition accuracy ( the same or slightly worse ) by using only the remaining portion of the segment ( the portion from which noise contamination has been removed ) , this method is considered as an effective solution to the aforementioned problem .        for real motor imagery data ,",
    "two ways were used to randomly remove the partial data from the segment .",
    "one is that data points within a segment were randomly removed ( see fig .",
    "[ point60rem ] for an example ) .",
    "the other is that data blocks within a segment were randomly removed ( see fig .",
    "[ block60rem ] for an example ) .",
    "the width of the blocks removed was generated according to a normal distribution with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 10 .",
    "we used the data from the preceding session to train the svm classifier with a rbf kernel , and tested it with the data from the following session .",
    "two approaches were used for the evaluation of the accuracy ( i.e. , sliding time window accuracy and trial accuracy ) . sliding time window accuracies were calculated as the number of segments classified as correct divided by the total number of segments .",
    "a trial was classified as belonging to the class to which most of the sliding time windows within that trial belonged .",
    "then trial accuracies were obtained according to the ratio of trials classified as correct .",
    "[ accpoint ] and fig .",
    "[ accblock ] show test accuracies for the conditions of data point removal and data block removal , respectively .",
    "in general , the accuracies for all sessions of all subjects did not dramatically decrease .",
    "trial accuracies varied more than sliding time window accuracies across different proportional sections of data removal .",
    "this is because a trial was classified as correct even if the number of sliding time windows in the trial classified as correct was only one more than the number of sliding time windows classified as incorrect .",
    "likewise , trials with one more incorrect sliding time window than correct sliding time window were classified as incorrect .",
    "therefore , in some cases , the trial accuracy changed greatly while the accuracy of the sliding time widows did not change much .",
    "a comparable classification accuracy could be achieved even when 80% of data were removed .",
    "high accuracies were retained no matter how many data points were removed - in the range from 10% to 80% - for subject 1 , especially for sessions 2 and 3 .",
    "the accuracies for 80% data removal were substantially worse than those for 70% data removal for subject 1 in the condition of block data removal .",
    "it appears that our method is relatively sensitive to data removal in block form .      in this section ,",
    "we show a comparison between dae and svm in terms of classification accuracy of sliding time windows .",
    "svm has been widely adopted since its conception and has been successfully applied in many fields .",
    "deep learning is a promising and burgeoning method .",
    "dae is utilized as a building brick to compose a deep learning network .",
    "it is meaningful to illustrate the effectiveness of this for eeg feature recognition using our paradigm .",
    "the parameters used in the training are listed in table [ paras ] .",
    "[ acccompoint ] shows the accuracy difference between dae and svm for each session of each subject under the condition of data point removal .",
    "asterisks located above the zero horizontal line mean that the accuracy of dae is higher than that of svm .",
    "the bars shown on the right of each sub - plot are the average differences .",
    "the bottom right plot illustrates the overall difference averaged across all sessions of all subjects . from fig .",
    "[ acccompoint ] , we can see that there is no clear winner - the dae is better than the svm in a number of sessions but turns out to be worse in other sessions .",
    "the overall average accuracy of dae is still better than that of svm .",
    "[ acccomblock ] shows the accuracy comparison under the condition of block point removal .",
    "the result is similar to the condition of data point removal .",
    "the overall average accuracy of dae is higher than that of svm under the condition of block point removal , but the increase in accuracy of dae compared with svm is less than the case of data point removal .",
    ".parameter settings [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]             from the results of comparisons , the dae is shown to be comparable to the svm . however , it is possible that the dae can outperform the svm when more layers are used and parameters are better tuned .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the dae can significantly exceed the svm in terms of eeg classification , but there has been a report that stacked dae ( i.e. , multiple daes combined together to obtain deeper learning of features ) performed better than the svm on the image benchmark dataset named mnist @xcite .",
    "we propose the combination of the lomb - scargle periodogram and either svm or dae to distinguish incomplete eeg segments ( i.e. , segments from which a portion of data has been removed due to noise contamination ) .",
    "the results indicate that classification accuracy is not dramatically decreased when different percentages of data are removed .",
    "therefore , the classification performance using the proposed method for incomplete segments is acceptable for a bci application system .",
    "this means that the segment with noise contamination can still be utilized to output commands after only removing the noisy portion , instead of discarding the whole segment , as is conventionally done in bci systems . in brief",
    ", the proposed method can achieve comparable classification performance even when most of the data points in a segment have been removed .",
    "it provides an alternative solution for the frequent problem occurring in a bci system that there is no output when a segment is discarded .",
