    "if the initial direction of the orbital angular momentum of the satellite significantly differed from the main galaxy disk rotation momentum , then we may now have a situation when some fraction of stars or gas clouds in the galaxy are rotating on orbits tilted ( or orthogonal ) to the main galactic disk , or even counter - rotating within it .",

    "the stellar nucleus of ngc  7743 has appeared to be chemically and evolutionarily decoupled : the mean stellar age in the nucleus is only 1  gyr , the metallity is 1.5 times above solar . beyond the nucleus , metallicity drops to subsolar values , and the age stabilizes at about 2.5  gyr .",
    "we suppose that our measurements at @xmath81 ( i.e. 1.92.8 kpc ) relate mainly to the bulge and bar of ngc  7743 , based on its surface brightness distribution @xcite .",
    "earlier , we already reported the chemical and evolutionary distinction of the nucleus of ngc  7743 with our integral - field spectroscopic results for the central part of the galaxy . by obtaining the data with the multi - pupil fiber spectrograph ( mpfs ) of the russian 6-m telescope ,",
    "@xcite has measured the lick indices and found that the nucleus was 5 times more metal - rich , and by more than 2  gyr younger with respect to the neighboring bulge .",
    "however , the absolute values of the ages and metallicities obtained here differ from those , obtained by @xcite : there [ z / h]@xmath82 was found for the nucleus and @xmath83 for the bulge , and the mean age of the bulge was determined as 4  gyr old .",
    "the emission lines were very strong in the nuclear and circumnuclear spectra , and the excitation mechanism of those was unclear , so perhaps the correction of the lick index h@xmath84 for the emission by @xcite was not completely correct ; hence , the stellar population parameters for ngc  7743 in silchenko ( 2006 ) may be biased .",
    "later , @xcite have analysed the sauron data ( which are analysed here as well ) , by the method of direct spectrum fitting in the pixel area , that allows to exclude all the spectral regions , affected by emission .",
    "the results of the sauron data analysis by @xcite agree perfectly with the present results , derived by fitting the long - slit scorpio spectra : they have obtained [ z / h]@xmath85 and the age of 1.2  gyr for the nucleus , and [ z / h]@xmath86 and the age of 2.2  gyr for the bulge @xcite while fig .

    "therefore , while in the vicinity of the nucleus the gas ionization is mainly produced by an active non - thermal radiation source , just in 300500 pc from the center the main contributors into the ionization are the shock waves .",
    "perhaps , one of the local producer of the shock wave is the jet of the active nucleus ( discussed below ) . for the more distant parts of the gaseous disk it is reasonable to relate shock waves to the inclined orbits of the gas clouds , which must collide with the interstellar medium of the main large - scale stellar disk ( even if the density of the latter is very low )",
    ". moreover , a shock wave may be induced by a simple gas cloud , crossing the potential well of the stellar disk , quite analogous to the shock being induced by a gas cloud , crossing a spiral density wave in large - scale disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "this mechanism was discussed by @xcite , who considered the shock wave generation in the gas of polar ring galaxies . in favor of the latter hypothesis we can refer to the measurements along @xmath47 , where we trace the emission - line intensity ratios towards the largest distance from the center . at the radii of @xmath120 ( 1.95.1 kpc ) we obtain @xmath121 } / \\mbox{h}\\alpha",
    "> -0.3 $ ] that excludes photoionization by young stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , throughout the whole large - scale gaseous disk of ngc  7743 the gas is ionized by shock waves .",
    "[ fig_longslit_results ] shows that the velocity dispersion of ionized gas in the center of ngc  7743 exceeds that of the stellar component more than twice ; evidently , it is an active nucleus effect .",
    "moreover , in the long - slit cross - sections along @xmath52 and @xmath100 the gas velocity dispersion peaks are displaced from the ( optical ) nucleus by 12   ( i.e. by 90190 pc ) , and the gas",
    "line - of - sight velocity drops at this radius .",
    "the sauron maps reveal this displacement even better : in fig .",
    "[ fig_sauron_results ] one can see a ` blue ' velocity spot and the gas velocity dispersion peak at @xmath122  to the south from the nucleus . within this ` spot '",
    "the emission - line profiles in the sauron spectra look asymmetric , and the scorpio spectra , which have better spectral resolution allow to decompose the entire profiles into two emission - line components ( fig .  [ multicomponent_profile ] ) .",
    "we simultaneously fitted the emission - line profiles for @xmath123 , [ oiii ] , [ nii ] , , and [ sii ] via a set of gaussians broadened with the lsf , by requiring the same velocity difference between two components for all species .",
    "the best fit is presented in fig .",
    "[ multicomponent_profile ] ; the more intense component of all the lines ( comp .",
    "2 ) corresponds to the regularly rotating gas , and the faint emission - line components ( comp .  1 )",
    "are blueshifted by @xmath124 .",
    "big black triangles in fig .",
    "[ diagn_diagramm ] show intensity ratios for two components separately .",
    "one can see that the ratio of @xmath30 } / \\mbox{h}\\beta $ ] for the off - nuclear comp .  1 is higher than this ratio in the whole disk , and it is even higher than that in the close vicinity of the active nucleus . a similar picture  a high - speed strong shock excitation along with non - circular motions of the gas in a local off - centered area  has been observed by @xcite in the seyfert galaxy mrk  334 , where this area has been identified as a point of a satellite fragment crossing the galaxy disk .",
    "another consequence of such crossing must be the lower gas density in this ` hole ' with respect to the neighboring disk .",
    "however in ngc  7743 on the contrary , the blueshifted comp .  1 reveals a very high electron density , @xmath125 , which is determined from the intensity ratio of @xmath32}\\lambda 6717 / \\mbox{[s\\,ii]}\\lambda 6731 $ ] , while the regularly rotating disk comp .",
    "2 only has @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , in this peculiar region we detect gas compression at the shock wave front .",
    "the probable cause of the shock waves can be an active - nucleus jet , penetrating the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "such intrusions are observed in many seyfert galaxies , for example , in mrk  3 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for ngc  7743 we have no narrow - filter emission - line images with a sufficiently good spatial resolution to inspect this peculiar region in detail . but @xcite mentioned a ` blue - color excess ' just in @xmath76 ( @xmath127 pc ) to the se from the nucleus at the hst map of the galaxy  it may be the region of the suggested jet intrusion . in this case , we only see the jet directed towards us , while the counterjet is obscured by the galaxy disk .",
    "the radio image of the jet would be a decisive proof for this suggestion .",
    "but , as we noted in section  2 , all the radiocontinuum maps of ngc  7743 demonstrate only its compact core .",
    "perhaps , the spatial resolutions and sensitivities of these radio observations are insufficient to resolve a jet .",
    "the previously known data ( see section  [ sec_n7743 ] ) characterized ngc  7743 as an ordinary early - type spiral galaxy with a weak nuclear activity .",
    "the traces of nuclear jet intrusion ( the size of the jet must be less than 200 pc ) into the interstellar medium , which we have found , are not so surprising for a seyfert galaxy .",
    "however , another astonishing fact is revealed : the bulk of the ionized gas , up to the distance of 45 kpc from the center , rotates on the orbits strongly inclined ( by @xmath128 or by @xmath129 ) to the plane of the stellar disk .",
    "the large - scale disk of ngc  7743 lacks prominent hii - regions , and the gas excitation determined by us from the emission - line spectrum is shock - like .",
    "a similar situation has been observed by us in ngc  5631 @xcite , where the large - scale gaseous disk is slightly inclined to the stellar one , and has an opposite spin .",
    "we have suggested two possible origins of the shock - like excitation : it can be either due to the collisions between the accreted gaseous clouds on the inclined orbits with the original low - density gaseous disk coplanar to the stellar one , or due to the accreted gas clouds , crossing the gravitational well of the stellar disk .",
    "however , in any case the gaseous content of the main galactic disk must be several times smaller than the accreted gas mass .",
    "otherwise we would see two - component emission - line profiles over the whole disk extension , not only in the jet region .",
    "unfortunately , we have not found any simulations of shock waves induced in inclined gaseous disks in the literature , except the estimations by @xcite for the case of polar rings .",
    "however , qualitatively we consider the mechanisms , proposed above as quite probable and similar to the spiral density wave generation in large - scale gaseous disks of spiral galaxies and to the shock - induced dust lanes at the leading edges of bars .",
    "these scenario can also explain the complex gas velocity behavior in the inner part of ngc  7743 : the large - scale bar of the galaxy does not affect the gas at large distances from the center , but can affect its rotation at @xmath130 .    among the galaxies known as",
    "` polar - ring galaxies ' we can note several cases of strongly inclined rings .",
    "first of all , it is ngc  660 where the outer gas - dust ring is inclined by @xmath131 to the main galactic disk @xcite .",
    "an inclined gaseous disk , less pronounced than that in ngc  660 , and more similar to the case of ngc  7743 has been recently found in arp  212 by @xcite . in arp  212 ,",
    "a set of hii - regions within the radii of 26 kpc concentrates in the plane , which is inclined by @xmath132@xmath133 with respect to the inner disk of the galaxy ; in the regions where two disks are crossing , prominent shock fronts are seen .",
    "@xcite suggested gas accretion from the neighboring gas - rich satellite , as the most probable mechanism of the inclined disk formation in arp  212 .",
    "such a scenario for the formation of polar and inclined gaseous rings was firstly proposed by @xcite and greatly developed during the past years , see @xcite .",
    "we think that a similar scenario has provoked formation of the gaseous disk in ngc  7743 . an alternate explanation may be minor merging or even a disruption of a gas - rich satellite by tidal forces from ngc  7743 .",
    "but the latter scenario would produce other consequences , such as kinematically decoupled stellar subsystems , or the outer shells and arcs , which are not observed in ngc  7743 .",
    "we hence conclude that in any case a possible contribution of the accreted stellar component in ngc  7743 would be small , and we have to come back to the gas - dominated accretion as the probable cause of the present state of ngc  7743 .",
    "in section  [ sec_n7743 ] we have already mentioned that near ngc  7743 there are at least two gas - rich satellites , so there is no problem to identify a source of gas accretion . moreover , in @xmath134 ( 279 kpc ) from ngc  7743 , another s0-galaxy , ngc  7742 , is located ; the systemic velocity of ngc  7742 differs from that of ngc  7743 by only @xmath135 .",
    "let us imagine that earlier ngc  7742 and ngc  7743 approached each other with a typical relative velocity of @xmath136 ; then the time spent after this passage is about 1.4  gyr .",
    "this time is comparable to the age of the nuclear star formation burst in ngc  7743 , that may be induced by this interaction .",
    "however , we doubt that the inclined gaseous disk was formed during the same event , because this inclined - disk configuration is dynamically unstable and can not persist its inclined rotation during several periods .",
    "it is probable that the inclined - orbit gas was accreted more recently .",
    "using the data of deep long - slit spectroscopy , obtained at the russian 6-m telescope , and the archive data of the integral - field spectrograph sauron , we have studied the stellar population properties and kinematics of the stellar and ionized - gas components in the early - type disk galaxy ngc  7743 .",
    "we report the following results .    * all the ionized gas at radii of 1.55.4 kpc",
    "is confined to the disk , inclined strongly to the main stellar disk of ngc  7743 .",
    "the angle between two disks is estimated ; two possible solutions are obtained , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , depending on the mutual disk orientation in the space .",
    "the most probable origin of this inclined gaseous disk is the accretion from the gas - rich environment of ngc  7743 .",
    "the main contributor into the gas excitation are the shock waves , induced probably by inclined - orbit gas clouds , crossing the main stellar disk .",
    "* complex motions , multi - component emission - line profiles , and strong shock excitation of the gas inside a compact region in 12to the south from the nucleus are interpreted by us as the signatures of active - nucleus jet interaction with the surrounding ambient medium .",
    "* we confirm the recent , about 1  gyr ago , intense star formation burst in the very center of ngc  7743 , perhaps stimulated by the tidal interaction with the neighboring ngc  7742 .",
    "the inclined gaseous disk in ngc  7743 has one of the lowest contrasts among the structures of this kind , discovered in external galaxies .",
    "we think that deep spectroscopy of other gas - poor early - type disk galaxies would allow to find a lot of such inclined gaseous disks , formed by gas accretion from external sources .",
    "this research is partly based on the data , obtained from the isaac newton group archive which is maintained as part of the casu astronomical data centre at the institute of astronomy , cambridge .",
