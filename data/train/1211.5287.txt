    "the multi - band superconductivity mechanisms with interband pairing channels have been became more and more actual @xcite .",
    "the rich physics included here is reflected by the unusual properties of relevant compounds . in particular , the discovery of novel vortex structure in magnesium diboride @xcite , interpreted as type-1.5 superconductivity , points unambiguously to the non - trivial modification of coherency in multi - gap systems @xcite .",
    "recently the existence of type-1.5 superconductivity was suggested also in strontium ruthenate @xcite .",
    "the various aspects of spatially inhomogeneous multi - gap superconducting ordering were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the correlations and spatial variation of fluctuations in a two - band superconductor with intraband and interband pairings .",
    "the spatially inhomogeneous two - band superconductivity is described ( see e. g. @xcite ) by the following gap equations in the vicinity of critical point @xmath0\\delta_{\\alpha ' } ( \\mathbf{r } ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 are the fermi velocities and @xmath5 are the electron densities of states at the fermi level in the corresponding bands , @xmath6 .",
    "it is supposed that the superconducting ordering is created by the intraband effective electron - electron attractions with constants @xmath7 and by interband pair - transfer interaction ( constant @xmath8 ) .",
    "these interaction channels are supposed to be operative in the energy layer @xmath9 around the fermi level intersecting both bands .",
    "the temperature of the bulk superconducting phase transition @xmath10 follows from the linearized equations ( [ eq1 ] ) in the spatially homogeneous case .",
    "we consider the small deviation from the bulk superconductivity representing @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the bulk gaps .",
    "the system of linearized equations for the fluctuations @xmath13 follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , namely @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 if interband interaction channel is absent , @xmath19 and the system ( [ eq5 ] ) splits into two independent equations . for this case @xmath20 are the coherence lengths which describe the spatial behaviour of superconductivity in the autonomous bands .    for finite interband coupling the quantities",
    "@xmath20 can not be treated as relevant coherence lengths .",
    "instead , one obtains @xcite on the basis of eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) the length scales @xmath21 for the spatial variation of @xmath13 , and @xmath22 the coherence lengths found can not be attributed to the separate bands .",
    "their temperature dependencies are shown in fig .",
    "1 . as @xmath23 at the phase transition temperature @xmath10 , one observes the critical ( diverging ) behaviour of @xmath24 near @xmath10 , while @xmath25 remains finite .",
    "the maximum of @xmath24 below @xmath10 is characteristic feature of a superconductor with tiny interband pair - transfer interaction .",
    "that non - monotonicity is correlated with the temperature where the band with weaker superconductivity becomes active .",
    "the second peak of @xmath24 disappears with increase of interband coupling .",
    "by considering the dependency on @xmath26-coordinate only , the general solution of the system ( [ eq5 ] ) has the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 with @xmath29 the temperature dependencies of the amplitudes @xmath30 are depicted in fig . 2 for weak interband pairing .",
    "for @xmath31 the spatial behaviour in the band with stronger superconductivity is scaled predominantly by the critical coherence length ( @xmath32 ) . in this case",
    "the superconducting ordering is very close to the one - band situation where only one ( critical ) coherence length is of relevance .    larger discrepancy between intrinsic intraband critical points and the weakness of interband interaction play in favour of that trend . with the lowering of the temperature ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) or with increase of interband pairing ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) the non - critical channel becomes important for the band considered .",
    "for the band with weaker superconductivity both critical and non - critical channels contribute near @xmath10 ( @xmath33 ) . from fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we clearly see that for shorter distances @xmath34 scales by @xmath35 , while for longer distances by @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , the interplay of critical and non - critical contributions can result in the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath34 .",
    "critical and non - critical coherence lengths ( [ eq10 ] ) appear as scaling factors in the expressions for the correlation functions of superconductivity fluctuations @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the non - equilibrium gap order parameters . by using the statistics ,",
    "determined by the non - equilibrium free energy , one finds in the gaussian approximation @xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41 as interband pairing vanishes , @xmath42 transforms into the correlation function of independent band , scaled by the relevant coherence length , and @xmath43 . if interband interaction is present , the picture becomes more complicated . for shorter distances @xmath44 the functions",
    "@xmath42 decrease in space as @xmath45 , and this dependence may be caused by the different contributions in the bands stemming from critical or non - critical coherency channels . as the distance separating fluctuations increases , long range correlations , determined by @xmath46 , become dominating .",
    "therefore , there exists a possibility for the interchange of the leading role between the critical and non - critical contributions in the spatial behaviour of @xmath42 . at @xmath47 the short - range correlations @xmath48 are also involved . in the one - band case only long range correlations @xmath49 are present in this temperature region .",
    "more detailed analysis of the correlation functions ( [ eq15 ] ) can be found in ref .",
    "it was demonstrated that two - gap inhomogeneous superconductivity involves more complicated physics compared to one gap situation .",
    "critical and non - critical coherence lengths , found in two - band scenario , scale the spatial behaviour of superconducting fluctuations as well as their correlation functions .",
    "the concrete picture depends substantially on the temperature and the strength of interband interaction .",
    "however , even in the vicinity of critical point both short - range and long - range correlations are essential .",
