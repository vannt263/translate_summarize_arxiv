    "<S> the qnd form of eq.([eq : hintquads ] ) also explains the absence of any induced damping of the cavities by the mechanics , see @xcite . when @xmath96 , the qnd nature of the interaction is lost ( i.e.  @xmath97 , @xmath98 are no longer conserved ) , and thus for fixed @xmath99 , @xmath100 $ ] saturates as a function of @xmath101 . </S>",
