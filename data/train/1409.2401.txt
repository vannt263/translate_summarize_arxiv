    "ever since the inception of empirical morse potential about 85 years ago , a vast number of potential functions have been reported for molecules , with varying degrees of flexibility and accuracy .",
    "while much improvements and modifications of the original exponential potential is made , the construction of a universal energy - distance relationship for molecules still remains elusive .",
    "thus there is significant interest and development to mimic the real molecular situations , as evidenced from a large number of publications in recent years .",
    "generally , the more the number of parameters in analytic potential energy function , the better it fits with experimental data .",
    "the literature is vast ; some representative recent works include , for example @xcite and the references therein .    in this work , we are interested in a three - parameter exponential potential for diatomic molecules , named hyperbolic ( empirical ) potential , suggested in 1986 , by schiberg @xcite , @xmath1 ^ 2 , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\sigma_0 <",
    "1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 are three positive adjustable parameters representing the properties of interaction potential .",
    "the potential function has a minimum value zero at a point @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes equilibrium distance ( bond length ) between the nuclei .",
    "it approaches infinity at the point @xmath5 , and goes to @xmath6 exponentially for large @xmath7 .",
    "also its relation to morse , kratzer , coulomb , harmonic oscillator and other potential functions has been discussed @xcite .",
    "further it is suggested that this potential may fit the experimental rydberg - klein - rees curve more closely than the morse function .",
    "some other interesting aspects of this potential can be found in the references @xcite .    like many other potentials of physical interest , while the schrdinger equation with hyperbolic potential can be solved for @xmath8 waves , _ exact _ solutions has not yet been obtained so far for @xmath9 states , due to the centrifugal term . thus approximations are necessary for a general eigenstate with arbitrary quantum numbers @xmath0 .",
    "several attempts have made before , some of which are mentioned now .",
    "approximate solution of schrdinger equation of diatomic molecules with this potential has been obtained using hypergeometric series method @xcite .",
    "rigorous solutions for @xmath10 case have been provided , where the eigenfunctions are expressed in terms of jacobi polynomials @xcite .",
    "later , arbitrary @xmath11-state solutions are constructed in @xcite by a proper approximation of the centrifugal term offering normalized functions in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath12 .",
    "arbitrary @xmath11-wave solutions have also been suggested by an approximation @xcite to the centrifugal term as @xmath13 .",
    "good - quality eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for general quantum numbers @xmath0 were presented by employing a nikiforov - uvarov approach @xcite , such that the approximate energy spectra and normalized total wave functions are represented in closed form through hypergeometric functions or jacobi polynomials . in another development @xcite ,",
    "general eigensolutions are provided by means of an asymptotic iteration method in conjunction with a proper approximation to the centrifugal term . very recently ,",
    "non - relativistic @xmath11-state solutions of n - dimensional schrdinger equation with hyperbolic potential has been offered @xcite in hyperspherical coordinates within the asymptotic iteration method along with an approximation to the centrifugal term along the lines of @xcite .",
    "relativistic bound - state solutions are also discussed by solving the dirac equation with an aid of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and functional analysis method @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued recently @xcite that the three empirical molecular potentials , _ viz .",
    ", _ manning - rosen , schlberg and deng - fan potentials perform rather closely to the celebrated morse potential .",
    "this was numerically done in terms of two spectroscopic parameters , namely , vibrational rotational coupling parameter @xmath14 and anharmonicity parameter @xmath15 for a set of 16 selected diatomic molecules .",
    "the purpose of this work is to make a systematic investigation on the bound - state spectra of hyperbolic potential through accurate eigenvalues , eigenfunction and other properties .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that for some of the other molecular potentials like morse , kratzer , pseudoharmonic or manning - rosen , etc .",
    ", a decent number of theoretical attempts have been published .",
    "thus very good - quality results are available .",
    "however for the potential under consideration , relatively much less effort has been made . in this study",
    ", we employ the generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) method , found to offer promising results for a number of physical situations ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) in recent years .",
    "this is a simple , efficient and yet accurate method which relies on an optimal , spatial discretization of the radial schrdinger equation .",
    "the usefulness and validity of our proposed scheme is demonstrated through quite accurate ro - vibrational energies of _ both low and high - lying _ states covering weak , intermediate and strong interaction in the potential .",
    "thus at first we report the energies of _ both _ @xmath8-wave and rotational states for different @xmath16 and @xmath17 values .",
    "then a detailed analysis of energy variation with respect to the parameters @xmath18 is presented , which , to our knowledge , has not been attempted before .",
    "a thorough comparison with literature results is made whenever possible .",
    "section ii gives a brief summary of the employed method , while section iv discusses the results .",
    "finally a few concluding remarks are made in section v.",
    "since this has been already discussed earlier @xcite , it suffices here to give only a review .",
    "the desired radial schrdinger equation in a non - relativistic case can be written as , @xmath19 the hamiltonian operator includes usual kinetic and potential energy terms ( symbols have their usual meanings ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is given in eq .",
    "the principal feature of this scheme lies in approximating a function @xmath22 defined in the interval @xmath23 $ ] by a polynomial @xmath24 of order n @xmath25 such that the approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _",
    "@xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 in what follows we employ the legendre pseudospectral method using @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are obtainable from the roots of first derivatives of legendre polynomial , @xmath31 with respect to @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , called cardinal functions , are given by the following expression , @xmath35 they have the unique property @xmath36 .",
    "now the semi - infinite domain @xmath37 $ ] is mapped onto a finite domain @xmath23 $ ] by a transformation @xmath38 .",
    "then one can make use of the following algebraic nonlinear mapping , @xmath39 where l and @xmath40 may be termed as the mapping parameters .",
    "furthermore , introducing a symmetrization procedure , eventually leads to the following transformed hamiltonian , @xmath41 the advantage is that this leads to a _",
    "matrix eigenvalue problem which can be readily solved to give accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "many other features of the method can be found in the references mentioned above .",
    "a series of test calculations were done for a number of potential parameters in the literature to optimize its performance with respect to the mapping parameters . in this way",
    ", the following parameter set ( @xmath42 ) has been consistently used throughout this work , which seemed to be quite satisfactory for the purpose at hand .",
    "it has been found that , for lower states , smaller values of @xmath43 is often sufficient .",
    "however for higher states , this needs to be increased presumably to incorporate the complicated long - range tail in the wave function . in previous studies with gps method , such as for hulthn and yukawa potentials in @xcite ,",
    "similar phenomenon was observed , where for _ higher _ excitations and for _ stronger _ screening parameters , maximum values of @xmath7 were increased in order to obtain eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of comparable high accuracy as in the present study .",
    "thus one can obtain decent accuracy with relatively smaller @xmath7 ; however , if the desired accuracy is high , then usually higher values of radial distance is necessary .",
    "recently , a similar situation has been encountered in the study of bound states of manning - rosen potential within a j - matrix approach as well @xcite .",
    "however , it is worthwhile noting here that the accuracy in the gps method is apparently not affected by the total _ number of grid points _ , as long as a reasonably decent number of collocation points are used for sampling the radial mesh . thus changing the maximum",
    "@xmath7 has no bearing on the computational effort , which is dictated by the dimension of hamiltonian matrix , i.e. , the number of grid points .",

    "here , we provide the numerical values for some representative states through the current gps scheme , for sake of completeness and assessing approximate theoretical methods in future .",

    "first systematic and definitive results for arbitrary @xmath53 states were published in @xcite .",
    "present calculated ro - vibrational energies seem to agree with those of @xcite in the _ short _ range ( small @xmath16 ) more than that in the _ long _ range ( large @xmath16 ) .",

    "the current energies show very good agreement with these , especially in the _ long _ range as well for _ higher _ excitations .",
    "the recent asymptotic iteration results @xcite employing a very similar expansion for the centrifugal term , generally produces eigenvalues similar in quality with that of @xcite in majority occasions , but occasionally showing slight improvements in other cases . wherever possible , numerically calculated eigenvalues @xcite generated from the mathematica suite of computer program , as reported in @xcite , are also quoted for easy comparison .",
    "these are also in general agreement with other reference energies .",
    "we are able to present energies accurate up to the tenth place of decimal , for which there appears to be no reference available for direct comparison .",
    "now we proceed for changes in energy with respect to potential parameters .",
    "figure 1 depicts such variations for @xmath56 states in the left panel in ( a ) , for @xmath57 for a considerably broad range of @xmath16 .",

    ". the threshold @xmath16 value , after which energy becomes constant , is gradually shifted to higher values as @xmath17 is increased .",
    "a similar trend has been observed for other states as well , which are not repeated .    .",
    "the left panel ( a ) corresponds to @xmath56 states , having @xmath57 , while ( b ) shows the same for 2p state for a fixed @xmath44 , and @xmath59 , 0.8 respectively . ]    .",

    "energy variations are considered with respect to @xmath17 , for a constant value of @xmath44 .",
    "the left panel ( a ) displays this for @xmath56 states , having @xmath60 . for all of them , at first energy sharply falls from an initial fixed value and then starts to decrease at a slower rate after some particular @xmath17 , resembling much like an exponential decay . for a given @xmath11 quantum number , the initial",
    "fall - off is much stronger for lower @xmath58 , and its extent gradually diminishes for higher values of @xmath58 , so much so that for 10p ( not shown in the figure ) , it very much looks like a linear decay . for other @xmath11 series of the hyperbolic potential ,",
    "very similar trend is followed and thus omitted .",
    "the right panel ( b ) now shows how energy changes with @xmath17 , for a state , for seven values of @xmath60 , 0.2 , @xmath61 , 0.7 , taking 2p as a representative . for progressively higher values of @xmath16 ,",
    "the separation between two successive curves tends to diminish and individual plots appear to be much flatter , once again approaching a linear behavior for sufficiently higher value of @xmath16 .",
    "the general qualitative features remain same for other states as well .     for ( a ) @xmath56 states , having @xmath62 , ( b ) 2p state for fixed @xmath44 , @xmath63 .",

    "3 shows energy eigenvalues ( in a.u . ) with respect to the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "first in the left panel ( a ) , 2p8p state energies are depicted for a sufficiently large range of @xmath6 , keeping both @xmath64 constant at 0.1 . for low-@xmath58 states , energy increases steadily in the beginning at smaller @xmath6 , which is eventually arrested after some time , with a consequent slow down of further increase .",
    "as @xmath58 assumes higher values , the rate of increase tends to remain unhindered resulting very much a straight - line like shape .",
    "now the middle panel ( b ) shows similar plots for a representative 2p state for seven @xmath16 values of 0.1 , 0.2 , @xmath61 , 0.7 ( covering short and long range ) , keeping @xmath45 , in all cases .",
    "same observation as in ( a ) holds true ; as @xmath16 goes to higher values , the individual plots lead to higher energy values and also tend to become more like straight line .",
    "also the separation between two neighboring @xmath16 plots becomes smaller and smaller as the latter increases .",
    "then in the right panel ( c ) , we give the e versus @xmath6 plots , again for a selected state ( 2p ) for seven @xmath17 values , namely , 0.1 , 0,2 , @xmath61 , 0.7 , having a constant @xmath60 .",
    "note that the energy axis in ( c ) is different from ( a ) , ( b ) . in this case , for higher @xmath17 , energies go to lower values , and much like in ( a ) , ( b ) , the separation between two adjacent @xmath17 plots is reduced .",
    "very recently , energy variation with @xmath6 for @xmath65 states of this potential has been studied ( for fixed @xmath66 ) in @xcite by means of asymptotic iteration method , which seems to corroborate our present findings .    , for ( a ) @xmath67 states , having @xmath68 , ( b ) 2p state with @xmath45 , @xmath63 , and ( c ) 2p state with @xmath60 and @xmath69 respectively . ]    , for ( a ) @xmath67 states , having @xmath68 , ( b ) 2p state with @xmath45 , @xmath63 , and ( c ) 2p state with @xmath60 and @xmath69 respectively . ]    , for ( a ) @xmath67 states , having @xmath68 , ( b ) 2p state with @xmath45 , @xmath63 , and ( c ) 2p state with @xmath60 and @xmath69 respectively . ]",
    "in the present communication , we have provided accurate solutions of the schrdinger equation with a hyperbolic potential .",
    "non - relativistic eigenvalues are obtained easily by means of a generalized pseudospectral method , giving an optimal radial discretization .",
