    "consider the schrdinger equation with focusing nonlinearity ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 such an equation may appear as an envelope equation in the propagation of lasers ( see e.g. @xcite , and @xcite for a rigorous mathematical justification ) .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath3 ( inhomogeneous sobolev space ) and @xmath4 , then has a unique solution in @xmath5 , defined locally in time ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it needs not remain in @xmath5 globally in time : finite time blow - up may occur when @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( focusing , or attractive , nonlinearity ) ; see e.g. @xcite . since @xmath8 , the @xmath0-norm of @xmath9 is independent of time , and finite time blow - up means that there exists @xmath10 ( we consider only forward time evolution ) such that : @xmath11 many papers provide important properties about the blow - up rate or the profile at blow - up ; see e.g. @xcite for some analytical results , and @xcite for a nice survey of the latest results .",
    "we also point out that recent numerical experiments @xcite have shown a completely new phenomenon , where the blow - up profile is independent of the usual ground state ( quasi self - similar ring profile ) , and the blow - up rate seems to be the minimal one given by the theory ( square root blow - up rate ) . as recalled in @xcite , the main three directions of research in this subject are : giving sufficient conditions to have finite time blow - up in the energy space ; estimating the blow - up rate and the stability of the blow - up rgimes ; describing the spatial structure of the singularity formation . on the other hand ,",
    "it seems little attention has been paid to the time where blow - up occurs . in this paper , we investigate by numerical experiments the dependence of the blow - up time upon , for instance , the coupling constant @xmath12 , when the initial datum @xmath13 is fixed .    to motivate our study , we recall some results from @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors prove that if the initial datum @xmath14 is replaced by @xmath15 , then one can relate explicitly the blow - up time of the corresponding new solution @xmath16 to that of @xmath17 , in the case of a critical nonlinearity , @xmath18 .",
    "this is a consequence of the conformal invariance . in the super - critical case @xmath19",
    ", the conformal transform does not leave invariant , and introduces a factor @xmath20 in front of the nonlinearity .",
    "it is also established in @xcite that if @xmath17 has negative energy ( in this case , there is finite time blow - up at least if @xmath21 @xcite ; see also @xcite for weaker assumptions ) , then _ for large @xmath22 _ , blow - up occurs sooner than for @xmath23 ; unlike in the conformally invariant case , one does not know whether the blow - up time is monotonous with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "the numerical experiments we present here show that it is not monotonous with respect to @xmath22 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author considers the damped cubic schrdinger in space dimension two : @xmath24 it is conjectured that the blow - up time is monotonous with respect to @xmath25 , and guessed that the same holds in the super - critical case .",
    "our numerical experiments show that neither of the two guesses is satisfied .",
    "these two guesses are very satisfactory when one think of the initial datum @xmath13 as a single hump ; numerics also suggest that in this case , the blow - up time is monotonous with respect to @xmath26 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath13 is made of , say , two humps , then the initial intuition seems to be wrong .",
    "note that introducing @xmath27 , equation   is equivalent to : @xmath28 as in the case of initial quadratic oscillations mentioned above , this transform yields an equation of the form , with a time - dependent coupling `` constant '' , @xmath29 .",
    "this function of time is monotonous , decreasing .",
    "this naturally leads us to the question , when @xmath12 is really a constant : is the blow - up time monotonous with respect to @xmath12 ? tracking the dependence of the blow - up time upon @xmath12 can be viewed as both a generalization and a study case of the two problems raised in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "numerics show that both in the critical ( @xmath30 ) and in the supercritical case ( @xmath19 ) , one should not expect the blow - up time to be monotonous with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "essentially , the idea is the same as what was announced above : when the initial datum @xmath13 is a single gaussian , then monotonicity seems to holds .",
    "when @xmath13 is the superposition of two such functions , there is a lack of monotonicity .    roughly speaking ,",
    "suppose that two humps are placed to both sides of the origin and that the natural ( free ) time evolution tends to send mass from both these humps to the origin .",
    "this may occur thanks to a particular phase term , for instance , or simply mass dispersion . for large @xmath12 ,",
    "the blow - up occurs before the two humps have merged : the two humps do not interact before the blow - up , and break down independently . for small @xmath12",
    ", these humps merge into one hump before blow - up takes place .",
    "asymptotically , for `` large '' @xmath12 or for `` small '' @xmath12 , we observe some monotonicity in the blow - up time . on the other hand ,",
    "the monotonicity breaks down in the `` transition '' region , that is , for intermediate @xmath12 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we recall some analytical results on local existence and finite time blow - up for the nonlinear schrdinger equations that appear in this paper . for the sake of readability ,",
    "proofs are given in an appendix .",
    "numerical tests are presented in section  [ sec : numerconst ] to [ sec : numerdamped ] . in section  [ sec : numerconst ] , we consider the dependence of the blow - up time upon @xmath12 in ; in section  [ sec : numerquadr ] , we measure the dependence of the blow - up time upon a modification of the initial datum with quadratic oscillations ; section  [ sec : numerdamped ] is devoted to tests on and its natural generalization in one space dimension .",
    "in this section , we present some analytical results that provide bounds , from above and/or from below , for blow - up time .",
    "the techniques are classical : the proofs rely on strichartz estimates , conservations of mass and energy , and pseudo - conformal conservation law .",
    "yet , it seems that the explicit dependence of the existence time upon some parameters had not been investigated before , except in @xcite ( see section  [ sec : quadgene ] ) .",
    "these results are somehow a more quantitative motivation for the numerical tests that follow . technical proofs are given in appendix  [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "we first state a local existence result , from which we infer a lower bound on the blow - up time .",

    "note that in corollary  [ cor : improved ] below , we modify this condition , to a somehow weaker one .",
    "the reason is that in proposition  [ prop : local ] , local solutions are constructed without taking the conservations of mass and energy into account .",
    "we shall not recall explicitly the fact that for small initial data , the solution to does not blow up .",
    "indeed , for small data , the conservations of mass and energy yield an _ a priori _ bound on the @xmath41-norm of the solution , thus ruling out finite time blow - up . in our case ,",
    "small initial data means that , for instance , @xmath42 for some constant @xmath26 depending only on @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we shall not insist on that aspect , since our analysis is focused on regimes where blow - up does occur .",
