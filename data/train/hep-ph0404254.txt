    "the dipole picture of deep inelastic scattering at high energies @xcite@xcite is a popular and successful way of describing and analysing the hera data on electron - proton scattering , that is in particular quasi - real and virtual photon - proton scattering . in the recent past",
    "it has turned out that the framework of the dipole picture is well suited for studying the region of relatively small photon virtualities @xmath4 , that is the interesting transition region from perturbative to nonperturbative qcd .",
    "particular interest concentrates on the problem of finding possible saturation effects occurring in that transition region .",
    "in essence , the dipole picture describes the deep inelastic photon - proton interaction as a two - step process in which the photon first splits into a quark - antiquark pair  a colour dipole  which then in the second step scatters off the proton .",
    "the first foundations on which the dipole picture rests were already laid in @xcite . for a general discussion of the dipole picture and for further references",
    "see @xcite .",
    "one key problem in applying the dipole model in the transition region is to find a suitable description of the second step of the reaction , in other words to find the correct behaviour of the dipole - proton cross section .",
    "models for this cross section have been developed and tested in inclusive as well as diffractive scattering processes , see for example @xcite@xcite .",
    "particularly popular is the golec - biernat  wsthoff model @xcite@xcite which already in its first and simplest version gave a surprisingly good description of the hera data .",
    "an important improvement of that model was obtained in @xcite due to the inclusion of the correct logarithmic scaling violations according to dglap evolution at large @xmath4 while preserving the success of the model at low @xmath4 .",
    "more recently , also the problem of describing the dependence of the dipole cross section on the impact parameter and hence the question of the @xmath5-distribution of the cross section has been addressed @xcite .",
    "the two - step nature of the scattering process described above is most easily visualised in a perturbative situation , and much of the theoretical development of the dipole model has been guided by the perturbative picture of deep inelastic scattering in qcd at high energies .",
    "loosely speaking the dipole model tries to approach the transition to the nonperturbative region of small momenta from the perturbative side .",
    "although its phenomenological success is rather encouraging it is not a priori clear that this method is in fact admissible .",
    "it is therefore very important to study whether there can be contributions to the cross section at low @xmath4 which are not compatible with the formalism of the dipole model , that is contributions which can not be correctly accommodated despite the freedom in modelling the low-@xmath4 dipole - proton cross section .",
    "it is one aim of the present paper and the companion paper @xcite ( hereafter referred to as ii ) to address this question .",
    "one of our main results will in fact be the identification of two contributions to the amplitude which are not contained in the simple dipole picture .",
    "both of these correction terms are small at large @xmath4 but can become large at small @xmath4 . a second question which we consider to be important and which should be addressed in a nonperturbative framework is the following .",
    "it is frequently asserted that some sort of saturation must occur in real or virtual photon - proton scattering at high energies due to the froissart - martin - lukaszuk bound on total cross sections .",
    "however , this bound applies only to hadron - hadron scattering and a priori is not valid for a current - induced reaction ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is usually argued that the dipole formula allows one to consider photon - proton scattering in essence as a hadron - proton reaction .",
    "but if one really wants to substantiate this type of reasoning and maybe some day derive an analogue of the froissart - martin - lukaszuk bound for @xmath6 scattering one certainly should have a solid foundation for something like the dipole picture .",
    "it is our opinion that in order to achieve this goal one should not rely on perturbation theory alone .    in this work",
    "we start from a description of the real or virtual photon - proton scattering process in a generically nonperturbative framework developed by one of us in @xcite .",
    "this framework allows us to find a classification of different contributions to the cross section and to identify the approximations and assumptions that are necessary to arrive at the dipole model .",
    "we are able to identify two corrections to the dipole picture which can become large especially at low photon virtualities .",
    "in addition we find that our approach is also well suited to study two important problems which in our opinion have not yet been sufficiently appreciated so far .",
    "the first problem is that in qcd a mass - shell condition for quarks does not exist due to confinement .",
    "this is clearly not expected to be a serious problem in perturbative situations . however , if one wants to study high energy scattering in the nonperturbative domain this problem has to be taken very seriously .",
    "we will not be able to solve this deep problem in the present papers , but we hope to provide a framework in which at least the effects of assuming a mass - shell condition for quarks can be studied in more detail .",
    "the other important issue to which we would like to draw some attention concerns the electromagnetic gauge invariance in photon - proton scattering .",
    "it is well - known that gauge invariance in general imposes very strong restrictions on the amplitudes and on their factorisation .",
    "this has for example been discussed for the case of diffractive @xmath7 production at high energies in @xcite . in ii",
    "we find that important corrections to the simple dipole model are in fact required in order to ensure gauge invariance .",
    "it turns out that only at asymptotically high energies the simple dipole formula is obtained from the nonperturbative framework as a gauge invariant expression .",
    "this immediately raises the question whether presently accessible energies are large enough for the dipole picture to give a gauge invariant description in a sufficiently good approximation .",
    "our framework should make it possible to address this important question in more detail .",
    "the two papers are organised as follows . in the first paper",
    "we describe the general nonperturbative framework of our considerations and derive a classification of the contributions to the process of real or virtual compton scattering on a proton . after discussing the relative importance of the different contributions we proceed to study in detail those which we expect to be leading in the high energy limit . in the further discussion",
    "we then focus on these contributions and discuss in particular the renormalisation of the photon - quark - antiquark vertex .",
    "the high energy limit of the amplitude obtained so far is then studied in the second paper . there",
    "we discuss how the usual formula for photon - proton scattering in the dipole picture emerges .",
    "also in the second paper we discuss the important issue of gauge invariance .",
    "in particular we study how gauge invariance is manifest in the leading contribution to the scattering process .",
    "we then show that in the high energy limit different terms in the amplitude become gauge invariant separately .",
    "the perturbative wave function of the photon is derived and the consequences of gauge invariance for its correct definition are pointed out . finally , we discuss some properties of the wave function of the photon and derive some simple phenomenological consequences of the dipole picture which can help to determine the limits of its applicability .",
    "we present our conclusions in ii and point out some questions that in our opinion deserve further study .",
    "some technical details of our calculations are presented in the appendices of the two papers .",
    "here we analyse photon induced reactions using nonperturbative techniques introduced in @xcite .",
    "the aim is to see if one can justify the dipole picture for high energies or if modifications of the dipole picture are necessary .",
    "our method is quite general and can be applied to many processes .    , width=245 ]    for definiteness we consider real or virtual compton scattering on a proton ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath8 where we indicate the four - momenta in brackets . for @xmath9",
    "the absorptive part of the compton amplitude can be related to spin - dependent and spin - independent structure functions . in the present papers we always work in leading order of the expansion in powers of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath10 .",
    "note that throughout this paper the figures are drawn such that the incoming particles are on the right hand side .",
    "we have chosen this ordering in order to make the correspondence of the figures with the equations as close as possible  despite the fact that the opposite choice is probably more common in the literature .",
    "we suppose @xmath11 but do not require @xmath12 . the usual mandelstam variables are @xmath13 our procedure is rather general and allows us to treat the compton amplitude for the case of real and virtual photons on the same footing . in the case of virtual photons",
    "our calculations apply to transversely as well as to longitudinally polarised photons .",
    "however , for the latter there are some subtleties in the high energy limit , as we will explain in ii .",
    "we will at first keep to the cartesian indices @xmath14 for the photon polarisations .    before going into the technical details let us now give a short non - technical description of our method .",
    "we use the reduction formula to represent the amplitude for our process ( [ 2.1 ] ) as an integral over vacuum expectation values of the currents and the fields for the protons .",
    "then these vacuum expectation values are expressed as functional integrals in the usual way .",
    "since the lagrangian of qcd is bilinear in the quark degrees of freedom , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we can perform the integrations over @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to give a classification of contributions to our amplitude in diagrammatic language according to the topology of the quark line skeleton , see figure [ fig2 ] below .",
    "there the quark lines correspond to full quark propagators in a given external gluon field and the shaded blobs indicate the functional integration over all external gluon fields with a measure given below .",
    "the usual expectation is that at high energies the contribution shown in figure [ fig2]a will dominate .",
    "we show that also the diagram of figure [ fig2]b can give a leading contribution at high energies .",
    "we study first figure [ fig2]a in detail .",
    "we ` cut ' the quark lines after the vertex where the photon @xmath17 enters the diagram and insert suitable factors 1 , given by the dirac operator times the free green s functions of the quarks .",
    "integration by parts and the representation of the free green s functions of the quarks as dyadic products of quark and antiquark wave functions lead to four terms one of which can be interpreted as expected in the dipole picture .",
    "the photon @xmath18 splits into a quark - antiquark pair , which then interacts in all possible ways with the proton , see figures [ fig3]a and [ fig4]a below .",
    "however , these quarks and antiquarks are still off their energy shell , and one has to integrate over all these off - shell energies .",
    "but at high energies the leading contribution comes from the on - shell quarks .",
    "this corresponds to the contribution of a certain pinch singularity in the amplitudes considered as functions in the ( off - shell ) energy plane .",
    "adding now the contribution of the diagram of figure [ fig2]b , treated in a similar way , we have indeed described the original amplitude for the process ( [ 2.1 ] ) at high energies as a two step process .",
    "the leading term of the amplitude is given as a convolution of the bare @xmath19 vertex function with a scattering amplitude for a bare @xmath20 pair on the proton .",
    "it remains to introduce the renormalised quantities in place of the bare ones .",
    "this we do by using the dyson - schwinger equation for the @xmath19 vertex function which contains all higher order qcd corrections to the vertex . here",
    "our approach is inspired by the standard treatment of overlapping divergences in qed .",
    "finally , we arrive at the expression shown graphically in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig9 ] below .",
    "the leading contribution to the amplitude for the reaction ( [ 2.1 ] ) at high energies is given by two terms .",
    "the first one is a convolution of the renormalised @xmath21 vertex function , describing the splitting of the photon to the @xmath22 pair , with the renormalised amplitude for @xmath23 .",
    "the second term describes rescattering corrections .",
    "thus , on the side of the colour dipole amplitude , the contribution @xmath24 from the diagram of figure [ fig2]b must be added , and on the side of the incoming photon , we find the rescattering correction .",
    "these additional terms are also leading at high energies and could be important for phenomenology especially at small photon virtualities .",
    "in addition to deriving this general structure of the amplitude for ( [ 2.1 ] ) at high energies we discuss in ii the problem of electromagnetic gauge invariance and the related subtleties for the amplitudes of longitudinally polarised virtual photons . in summary , from the contribution of figure [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b we find something like the dipole picture at high energies .",
    "but usually only the term @xmath25 from the diagram of figure [ fig2]a times the photon vertex function is discussed in the dipole model .",
    "we find important additional terms as mentioned above .",
    "a key step in our procedure is to cut the amplitude next to the vertex of the incoming photon and to insert a factor 1 consisting of the dirac operator and of green s functions of the quarks .",
    "a similar step has of course been used more or less explicitly in many studies of the compton amplitude or of diffractive photon - proton scattering .",
    "many of those investigations are , however , restricted to the case of virtual photons in which perturbation theory can be applied . in our method",
    "this step is used in the framework of a nonperturbative description of the real and the virtual compton amplitude .",
    "but several technical aspects of our method clearly resemble those studies , see for example @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "after this outline of our procedure we now turn to the actual calculations .",
    "these involve sometimes lengthy formulae .",
    "but we hope that the figures accompanying them will , nevertheless , make them transparent .",
    "we should point out again that in order to make the correspondence between the equations and the figures as easy as possible all figures are drawn such that they are to be read from right to left .",
    "the matrix element for the reaction ( [ 2.1 ] ) is [ 2.3 ] ^_s^s(p^,p , q ) = d^4x  e^-iqx p(p^,s^)|^*j^(0)j^(x)|p(p , s ) , where @xmath26 is the proton mass , @xmath27 are the spin indices , and @xmath28 is the covariantised t - product .",
    "our proton states are normalised to @xmath29 all our conventions regarding kinematics , dirac spinors etc .",
    "follow @xcite .",
    "the hadronic part of the electromagnetic current is denoted by @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the quark field operators and @xmath32 are the quark charges in units of the proton charge .",
    "let @xmath33 be a suitable interpolating field operator for the proton .",
    "we can take @xmath34 to contain three quark fields , [ 2.5 ] _",
    "u_(x)u_(x)d_(x ) , and accordingly |_p(x)=| _    @xmath35 are coefficient matrices and @xmath36 summarize dirac and colour indices .",
    "explicit constructions of field operators @xmath33 of the type ( [ 2.5 ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath37 be the proton s wave function renormalisation constant defined by @xmath38    using now the lsz reduction formula @xcite and the representation of green s functions by the functional integral we get @xmath39 here we use a shorthand notation for the functional integral .",

    "the quark - field operators in @xmath43 and @xmath34 are to be replaced by the corresponding grassmann integration variables of the functional integral .",
    "gauge fixing and faddeev - popov terms in the functional integral are implied and not written out explicitly .    in ( [ 2.6 ] )",
    "we have used translational invariance to shift the argument of the current @xmath44 to zero . in the following this",
    "makes our procedure look somewhat asymmetric with respect to the treatment of the two currents @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we could equally well make the treatment completely symmetric with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath45 by shifting the argument of @xmath34 or @xmath46 to zero in ( [ 2.6 ] ) , see appendix [ appa ] .",
    "since the lagrangian of qcd is bilinear in the quark fields , we can immediately perform the @xmath47 functional integral .",

    "the methods used here for the classification of different contributions to the amplitude can also be applied to other current induced reactions at high energies . in the case of exclusive reactions for example one chooses appropriate interpolating field operators for the produced hadrons and can proceed exactly as discussed here for the compton amplitude .      with the diagrams of figure [ fig2 ] we have given a classification of all contributions to the compton amplitude ,",
    "see ( [ 2.7a1 ] ) . at high energies",
    "@xmath67 we expect the diagrams of figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b , that is @xmath68 of ( [ 2.8 ] ) and @xmath69 of ( [ mbexpl ] ) , to give the dominant contribution .",
    "indeed , let us consider the diagrams of figures [ fig2]a-[fig2]g for large @xmath67 .",
    "in figure [ fig2]c for instance we find at born level that a large momentum of order @xmath67 has to flow through the upper quark line .",
    "this leads to a suppression of order @xmath70 relative to the diagrams of figures [ fig2]a , [ fig2]b .",
    "similar arguments apply to the diagrams of figures [ fig2]d-[fig2]g .",
    "going one step further in sophistication we can have a look at resummed perturbation theory . in the perturbative framework",
    "the generic diagrams of figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b include gluon ladder diagrams , see figures [ fig200 ] and [ fig200b ] , respectively .",
    "a for the amplitude @xmath68 [ fig200],width=230 ]    b for the amplitude @xmath69 [ fig200b],width=268 ]    these are , of course , just the diagrams containing the leading order bfkl pomeron exchange @xcite .",
    "the leading perturbative diagrams contained in the generic diagrams of figures [ fig2]c-[fig2]g , on the other hand , do not contain such gluon ladders . instead , they typically contain quark - antiquark exchanges in the @xmath5-channel . as an example figure [ fig201 ] shows a perturbative quark ladder diagram contributing to the generic diagram of figure [ fig2]c .",
    "c for the amplitude @xmath65 [ fig201],width=204 ]    but it is well known that diagrams with quark - antiquark exchanges ( or more generally fermion - antifermion exchanges ) in the @xmath5-channel are suppressed by powers of the energy with respect to the corresponding diagrams containing gluon ( or more generally vector boson ) exchanges .",
    "similarly , also the generic diagrams in figures [ fig2]d and [ fig2]e contain quark - antiquark exchanges as the leading terms in perturbation theory .",
    "presumably also the leading terms of the generic diagrams of figures [ fig2]f and [ fig2]g correspond to quark - antiquark exchanges , see figure [ fig202 ] ,    g for the amplitude @xmath66 [ fig202],width=228 ]    where this is shown for the diagram of figure [ fig2]g .",
    "we can hence conclude that the leading perturbative diagrams for the generic diagrams of figures [ fig2]c-[fig2]g are suppressed by powers of @xmath67 with respect to the leading perturbative contributions to the amplitudes @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we also arrive at the same conclusion when we switch from perturbation theory to regge theory .",
    "quite generally , we expect the dominant contribution from the diagrams of figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b to be due to pomeron exchange , soft and hard , with its well - known phenomenological properties , see for instance @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we estimate that the main contribution from the generic diagram of figure [ fig2]c for large @xmath67 is due to reggeon exchange which would correspond to the diagram of figure [ fig201 ] , now interpreted as a diagram of regge theory .",
    "again , we know from phenomenology that reggeon exchanges are suppressed by a factor of roughly @xmath70 relative to soft pomeron exchange , see @xcite . thus we can argue that the generic diagrams of figure [ fig2]c and in a similar way those of figures [ fig2]d and [ fig2]e correspond to reggeon exchanges and are thus not leading for large @xmath67 .",
    "the same holds for the diagrams of figures [ fig2]f and [ fig2]g , as is illustrated in figure [ fig202 ] .",
    "again we find that the amplitudes @xmath65 - @xmath66 are subleading at high energy @xmath67 .",
    "let us now discuss the relative magnitudes of the amplitudes @xmath68 and @xmath69 corresponding to the figures [ fig200 ] and [ fig200b ]",
    ". at high energies the leading contributions to both amplitudes have the same dependence on the energy . as discussed above that dependence results from pomeron exchange or from gluon ladder diagrams , depending on whether one describes it in terms of regge theory or perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the typical perturbative diagrams are shown in figures [ fig200 ] and [ fig200b ] , respectively , and in pqcd these diagrams represent the leading contribution at high energies .",
    "the main difference between the two amplitudes is the coupling of the gluon ladder ( or the pomeron ) to the incoming and outgoing photon , or in perturbative language the impact factor . in the impact factor in @xmath69",
    "there are two quark loops which are connected by gluon lines . due to the charge parity of the photon a minimum number of three gluons",
    "is required to couple to each of these loops , and the diagram shown in figure [ fig200b ] is hence the lowest order contribution to the impact factor of @xmath69 . compared with the amplitude @xmath68 the amplitude @xmath69 therefore contains two additional factors of @xmath71 which are not compensated by any large logarithms .",
    "the relevant scale of @xmath71 is determined by the photon virtuality @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the amplitude @xmath69 is strongly suppressed at high virtualities . at small virtualities , however , @xmath71 becomes large and that suppression is no longer relevant . besides these factors of @xmath71 there appears to be no other simple mechanism suppressing the diagrams of figure [ fig200b ] .",
    "accordingly , these diagrams can potentially give an important contribution in the region of low photon virtualities .",
    "in our opinion their contribution , which is often neglected in applications of the dipole picture of high energy scattering , deserves further study",
    ". it would be especially interesting to find ways of estimating the relative size of the terms @xmath68 and @xmath69 at low @xmath4 using experimental data .",
    "it should be noted here that in our development of the dipole picture below we find that perturbative diagrams contained in figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b contribute to the colour dipole amplitude side and photon wave function side such that one can speak of a mixing of the diagram classes ( a ) and ( b ) in the colour dipole picture .",
    "this is relevant in higher orders in @xmath71 as we will discuss when we make the transition to renormalised quantities in section [ sec : currenttoquarkqft ] below .",
    "the preceding discussion refers to the leading terms ( at large @xmath67 and large @xmath4 ) and is therefore not affected by this effect .    from the observations made here we conclude that at high energies the amplitude @xmath68 is expected to give the leading contribution if the photon virtuality is large , and that at lower virtualities also the amplitude @xmath69 should become important .",
    "we will therefore in the following discuss in detail the amplitude @xmath68 , given in ( [ 2.8 ] ) , which corresponds to the diagram of figure [ fig2]a . for the amplitude @xmath69 ,",
    "figure [ fig2]b , the same steps can be done in a completely analogous way , see appendix [ appc ] .",
    "finally we note that for the hypothetical case of scattering of an isovector photon on an @xmath72 target only the diagram of figure [ fig2]a exists as long as one assumes equal up and down quark masses and neglects higher orders in the electromagnetic coupling @xmath10 , as we do throughout the present papers .",
    "indeed , in this case the current has the structure j^_isovector = |u ^u - |d^d , whereas the @xmath72 consists of three @xmath73-quarks .",
    "thus none of the diagrams of figures [ fig2]b-[fig2]g can be drawn for this case and @xmath68 gives the complete amplitude .      in the following we consider the diagram of figure [ fig2]a .",
    "we will in essence cut the quark lines at the vertex marked @xmath74 , insert factors of @xmath75 , and relate the amplitude for the scattering of the photon on the proton to that of scattering of a @xmath76 pair on the proton .",
    "we recall first that the free quark propagator for mass @xmath77 satisfies in the quark propagator @xmath78 indicates that this is the free propagator , whereas in the quark mass @xmath79 it indicates that this is the bare mass , see ( [ a.1 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath80 a simple exercise shows that @xmath81 can be written as a sum of dyadic products of quark and antiquark wave functions , see ( [ b.6 ] ) of appendix [ appb ]",

    "this double counting or overlapping divergences problem in the ` cut ' diagrams and its solution in ( [ 2.33 ] ) and ( [ 2.45 ] ) also ` mixes ' the diagrams of figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b .",

    "indeed , consider figure [ figinterab ] , which is clearly a diagram of type [ fig2]b , and cut the diagram first along the dotted line .     but also to @xmath162 [ figinterab],width=296 ]    then we have a colour dipole - proton amplitude of type [ fig2]b with a simple vertex on the photon side .",
    "cutting along the dashed line , we can interpret it as a colour dipole - proton amplitude of type [ fig2]a with a vertex correction on the photon side .",
    "this shows that great care has to be exercised when cutting perturbative diagrams and trying to interpret them in terms of colour dipole amplitude times photon wave function .",
    "we would like to stress that the original classification of diagram types in figure [ fig2 ] is not affected by this .",
    "the ` mixing ' of diagram classes comes into play only when one considers cut diagrams , and then an individual diagram like the one in figure [ figinterab ] can be associated with higher order corrections occurring to the left or to the right from the cut , depending on the position of the cut .",
    "finally we want to make some remarks concerning the outgoing photon . as we indicate briefly in appendix [ appa ] one can treat the outgoing photon @xmath163 of the compton amplitude in complete analogy to the incoming photon @xmath17 , performing all the steps we have done for the incoming photon in the same manner , including the renormalisation of the the photon vertex via its dyson - schwinger equation .",
    "the resulting expressions would in their form be completely symmetric in the incoming and outgoing photon . for the purpose of the present papers , especially for the study of the high energy limit to be discussed in ii",
    ", it will however be sufficient to treat only the incoming photon in this way .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the real and virtual compton amplitude for photon - nucleon scattering in a nonperturbative framework .",
    "we have classified the different contributions to the amplitude according to their quark line skeleton .",
    "we have discussed the relative magnitude of the different contributions and have identified the two contributions @xmath68 and @xmath69 represented by figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b as the leading ones at high energies . concentrating on these two contributions",
    "we have then inserted on the quark lines after the incoming photon vertex suitable factors of one , given by the free dirac operator acting on the free quark propagator for a chosen mass @xmath77 . after integrating by parts",
    "we have used spin times colour sum decompositions for the free quark propagators to obtain expressions which bring us closer to the dipole picture of high energy scattering . for both amplitudes @xmath68 and @xmath69 we obtained four terms where in each case only one had the structure of a vertex function describing the splitting of the photon into a @xmath76 pair convoluted with a scattering amplitude for an off energy shell @xmath164 pair on the proton .",
    "the results for these parts of the amplitudes @xmath68 and @xmath69 are given in ( [ 2.33 ] ) and ( [ 2.45 ] ) , respectively , see figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig9 ] . in ii these results will allow us to isolate the leading term in the high energy limit . a key point in the present paper",
    "is that we have taken into account the renormalisation of the photon - quark - antiquark vertex .",
    "we find that the renormalisation induces an important rescattering correction which is usually not taken into account in the dipole picture .    from the contribution of figure",
    "[ fig2]a we will be able to obtain the usual dipole picture of photon - proton scattering after suitable further approximations .",
    "we will in fact show that this is the leading term at high energies and large photon virtualities .",
    "we find , however , that there are two important correction terms which can potentially become large at small photon virtualities , that is in the interesting transition region from the perturbative to the nonperturbative regime .",
    "the first correction comes from the rescattering of the quark and antiquark into which the virtual photon splits , the second correction comes from the contribution of figure [ fig2]b . both of them are suppressed only at large photon virtualities but not due to large energies .",
    "the motivation for the dipole picture of high energy scattering is closely related to the notion of light - cone wave functions , see for example @xcite .",
    "when applied to a real or virtual photon this concept naturally suggests to include in addition to the quark - antiquark component also higher fock states of the photon like for example the quark - antiquark - gluon component of the wave function etc . , and to sum the amplitudes for the scattering of these components off the proton .",
    "also the perturbative framework can be arranged according to this view .",
    "we emphasise that in our treatment nothing is missing and , in particular , higher fock states do not and should not occur explicitly here .",
    "recall in this context that the solution of the overlapping divergences problem for the vacuum polarisation in qed ( see @xcite ) also does not involve analogues of higher fock states for the photon .",
    "nevertheless we think that it is an interesting problem for further investigations to try to see where and how the various terms of a fock state expansion of the photon as discussed for instance in @xcite can be identified in our approach .    in the second paper",
    "we will discuss in detail the high energy limit of the expressions ( [ 2.33 ] ) and ( [ 2.45 ] ) obtained here from the contributions of figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b .",

    "in particular , we will discuss whether different parts of the amplitude are separately gauge invariant .",

    "<S> this is the first of two papers in which we study real and virtual photon - proton scattering in a nonperturbative framework . we classify different contributions to this process and identify the leading contributions at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> we then study the renormalisation of the photon - quark - antiquark vertex that occurs in the leading contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we find something like the dipole picture in one of these contributions but also find two correction terms which can potentially become large at small photon virtualities . in the second paper we will discuss the additional approximations and assumptions that are necessary to obtain the dipole model of high energy scattering from the results found here .    i-.25em p    hd - thep-04 - 17 + ifum-789-ft + hep - ph/0404254 +     +   +    * carlo ewerz@xmath0 , otto nachtmann@xmath1 *    @xmath2 _ institut fr theoretische physik , universitt heidelberg + philosophenweg 16 , d-69120 heidelberg , germany </S>",
