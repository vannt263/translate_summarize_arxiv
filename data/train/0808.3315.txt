    "the spin degrees of freedom in an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) allow for a variety of topological defects . mermin - ho  @xcite and anderson - toulouse  @xcite vortices have been produced by the mit group  @xcite using the topological phase - imprinting method  @xcite .",

    "topological - defect structures in spinor becs are closely related to the symmetry groups of spin states  @xcite . for example , the symmetry group of the polar state ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the magnetic sublevel of the spin ) in a spin-1 bec is @xmath3 , and distinct configurations of the polar state can be specified by elements of this group .",
