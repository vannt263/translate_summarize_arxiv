    "the diffuse extragalactic background light ( ebl ) contains unique information about the epochs of formation and the history of evolution of galaxies , since it consists of the sum of the light produced by all extragalactic sources over cosmic time .",
    "its spectral energy distribution ( sed , fig . [ eblsed ] ) is characterized by two broad bumps@xcite , produced by thermal emission contributed directly from stars at optical ( opt ) and near infrared ( nir ) wavelengths , and by dust which partly absorbs and re - emits the starlight at longer wavelengths ( fir ) .",
    "the opt - nir range has gained special interest in recent years because some direct measurements between 1 and 3@xmath2have suggested the presence of a significant excess above the contribution of normal galaxies , which has been intriguingly interpreted as the signature of redshifted uv light from heavy population - iii star formation at @xmath3 @xcite ( though with severe energy - budget problems , see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , direct ebl measurements are subject to possible large systematic uncertainties due to the difficulty of an accurate modelling and then subtraction of the bright foregrounds , mainly consisting of zodiacal ( interplanetary dust ) light@xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ]    an alternative approach@xcite is provided by the measurement of very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-rays from extragalactic sources , through the detection and identification of absorption features in the vhe spectra caused by the interaction with ebl photons ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "high - energy peaked blazars ( hbl ) represent to this respect excellent sources of @xmath0-ray beams , thanks to their prominent tev emission and high apparent luminosity , which makes them detectable from large distances and/or with good photon statistics .",
    "the  downside \" is that they are highly variable and characterized by a very wide range of possible spectra .",
    "though a lot has been learned about them , the present understanding of their radiation processes is not yet complete enough to reliably predict the intrinsic tev spectra , and thus to disentangle absorption from intrinsic features .",
    "conversely , the still large uncertainties on the ebl prevent a sufficiently accurate reconstruction of their intrinsic spectra in order to constrain the emission models .",
    "the studies of blazars and ebl are therefore tightly coupled , in a classic case of  one equation , two variables \" problem@xcite .",
    "so far , only hints and guesses could be made from the tev detected objects ( in particular from the more distant 1es 1426 + 428 @xcite and pks 2155 - 304 @xcite ) , since the reconstructed spectra could be generally explained also as blazars intrinsic features . the surprising hardness of the h.e.s.s .",
    "spectra of 1es1101 - 232 and h2356 - 309@xcite ) represent a breakthrough in this respect , posing the problem of conflict between blazar spectra and ebl estimates in a much more severe and compelling way .",
    "to illustrate the effects of absorption , as reference shape for the ebl sed we adopted the phenomenological curve used in @xcite ( labelled p1.0 in figure 1 ) , which is designed to be in general agreement with the ebl spectrum expected from galaxy emission@xcite ( modulo normalization ) .",
    "such ebl sed imprints a specific shape onto the original spectrum , as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 ( center panel ) : above @xmath50.1 up to @xmath51 - 2 tev it causes a strong steepening , followed by a flattening between 2 and @xmath57 tev , where the observed spectrum partially recovers the original slope ( owing to the decline approximately @xmath6 above few microns , which causes the optical depth to become nearly constant with energy@xcite ) .",
    "further on , a sharp cut - off occurs above @xmath58 - 10 tev caused by the ebl sed rising again above 10@xmath2 .",
    "this yields two consequences : _ a ) _ with the current systematic uncertainties of cherenkov telescopes ( ct ) ,",
    "if the intrinsic spectrum is a power - law the observed spectrum can still be well approximated by a power - law model in the range 0.2 - 2 tev , but of steeper spectral index ( @xmath7 ) ; _ b ) _ measuring a spectrum above @xmath5200 gev , _ no cut - off _ is expected from ebl absorption up to @xmath56 - 7 tev : any cut - off measured by ct in such energy range is more likely to be intrinsic ( unless considering an ebl nir spectrum much flatter than @xmath6 ) .",
    "note also that in the range 0.2 - 10 tev breaks or cut - offs in the emitting particle distribution of blazar jets are quite common , as shown by the corresponding synchrotron emission in the opt  x - ray range .",
    "such intrinsic steepening might cancel out the expected flattening due to ebl absorption .",
    "in other words , the absence of such flattening in the tev spectra of some blazars does _ not _ imply an evidence for a different ebl spectrum . to detect such feature , a power - law ( and possibly hard ) intrinsic tev spectrum over @xmath52 decades",
    "is generally needed ( e.g. 1es 1426 + 428@xcite ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the effect of a change of the ebl normalization",
    " p \" and of source redshift : @xmath8 ( the difference between observed and intrinsic slope ) increases with both normalization and redshift .",
    "the two dependencies combine , so that at higher redshifts an equal change of ebl density yields a much stronger effect ( fig .",
    "2 , right panel ) . redshift thus provides leverage : more distant objects represent therefore a more sensitive diagnostic tool for ebl studies , but with the limitations given by generally lower fluxes ( and thus statistics ) .",
    "figure 3 shows instead the effects of a change in the ebl _ spectrum _ with respect to our template , namely increasing the flux in the 1 - 3@xmath2  range ( as would be required to match some direct estimates , and expected in the pop iii stars scenario ) or in the 0.1 - 0.3@xmath2  range . in the first case",
    "the steepening gets stronger , while in the second case it is reduced , because of a lower contrast in optical depth between 0.2 and 1 tev photons ( though at larger absolute values ) .",
    "note that a _ decrease _ of the uv - opt fluxes would not reduce the steepening , since it increases the contrast between the two energies while reducing the absolute values .",
    "it is also worth to highlight an important consequence of ebl absorption on blazar interpretation : if the ebl is high , sources at @xmath9 would be so heavily absorbed that their intrinsic inverse compton ( ic ) luminosity and peak energy become always much higher than the observed ones .",
    "the absorption - corrected values can easily reach ic peak energies @xmath10 - 10 tev and luminosities in excess of @xmath11erg@xmath12s@xmath13 , with a compton dominance of 10 - 100 .",
    "therefore , the bulk of their luminosity would be emitted at high energies , alike fsrq .",
    "in other words , they would represent the famous  high - energy peaked , high - luminosity \" blazars that would invalidate the blazar sequence scenario@xcite ( though it would remain the issue of why their radio luminosity is so low compared to fsrq ) .",
    "these objects would not have been recognized as such counter - examples simply because their luminosity would be largely underestimated , being dispersed in the intergalactic space due to @xmath14 absorption .",
    "though now this seems not the case ( see sect .",
    "3 ) , this possibility still remains also with a low ebl level , considering objects at significantly larger redshift ( but which are likely beyond the horizon of the present generation of ct ) .",
    "the intrinsic tev spectra were reconstructed directly from the observed ones , using the optical depth calculated for the assumed ebl sed . in this way no _",
    "a priori _ assumption on the blazar spectrum is required .",
    "the reconstructed spectra are compatible with a power - law model , but high ebl fluxes yield extremely hard photon indices ( @xmath15 ) , for both 1es1101 - 232 ( fig .",
    "4 , and whole sed in fig . 5 ) and h2356 - 309 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such hard spectra have never been seen in the closest , less absorbed objects ( e.g. mkn  421 and mkn  501 , @xmath16 for the same ebl seds ) and are difficult to explain within the standard leptonic or hadronic scenarios@xcite for blazar emission .",
    "assuming instead more typical values for the intrinsic spectrum as expected from the currently known blazar physics and phenomenology , namely that the true average vhe spectrum during the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations was @xmath17 ( as obtained under most circumstances if the index for the particle spectrum in shock acceleration models is @xmath181.5 , @xcite ) , the ebl sed has to be scaled down to the level of p0.45 , very close to the galaxy counts limit ( details in @xcite ) .",
    "this represents the upper limit for the ebl in the opt - nir range which does not require dramatic changes for the blazar physics or in the scenarios for the underlying particle spectra . accounting for galaxy evolution and for the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the h.e.s.s .",
    "spectral measurement , the limit corresponds to @xmath19nw m@xmath20 sr@xmath21(i.e .",
    "@xmath22 ; fig . 6 ) .",
    "of course , a different limit can be derived according to different hypotheses , and depending on their overall plausibility .",
    "but only strong spectral differences would qualitatively change this result ( see sect .",
    "4 ) : for example , even the case of a particle spectrum with @xmath23 , which has been argued as asymptotically possible in finit - mach - number shocks under certain conditions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , would raise the limit only slightly ( for 1es1101 - 232 , the change of scaling factor p is approximately @xmath24 ) .",
    "another way to avoid such hard spectra is to reduce the energy dependence of the optical depth by increasing absorption at low @xmath0-ray energies , i.e. with high uv - opt fluxes .",
    "however , the huge fluxes required to have @xmath25 ( @xmath26 nw m@xmath20 sr@xmath21 , see @xcite and fig . 3 left )",
    "are in contrast with measurements@xcite , even when interpreted as upper limits , and could hardly be accomodated within any reasonable cosmological model .",
    "unless considering even more exotic scenarios like violation of lorentz invariance or the non - cosmological origin of blazars redshift , at present the most viable alternative is that such hard spectra are a real , newly discovered feature of the blazar emission .    .",
    "it is obtained from the p0.45 curve , when accounting for galaxy evolution effects ( details in @xcite).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    possible mechanisms have already been envisaged@xcite .",
    "bulk - motion comptonization in the deep klein - nishina regime of a narrow - band photon field ( such as a planck - type distribution ) by cold plasma with a very large lorentz factor may lead to very hard spectra with a sharp pile - up , reproducing spectra like the ones in fig .",
    "4,5 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a  pile - up \" ( i.e. relativistic maxwellian ) particle distribution seems also expected as outcome of turbulent acceleration ( see e.g. @xcite and refs therein ) . in this case , however , even suppressing cooling and considering a purely monoenergetic distribution ( or a distribution with a similarly sharp low energy cut - off at @xmath27 @xcite ) , the resulting synchrotron and ssc spectrum would be at most @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if so , the ebl p0.45 upper limit would be shifted to @xmath5p0.72 .",
    "note that to make this scenario feasible it is necessary to always hide the hard synchrotron emission of these particles below a second , broader component which dominates the blazar emission at low energies , in order to account for the simultaneous sed ( fig .",
    "5 ) .    , when fitted in the range 0.2 - 1 tev , for different ebl seds ( as labelled ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to an ebl sed as low as the galaxy counts limit , and including galaxy evolution effects ( according to @xcite ) .",
    "the distance of the points over each curve represents visually the intrinsic hardness of the source spectra .",
    "red : h.e.s.s . data .",
    "blue : magic data .",

    ", scaledwidth=35.0% ]    however , even if theoretically feasible , also this alternative seems highly unlikely . if intrinsic , such pile - up features should be directly visible in the observed vhe spectra of closer , less absorbed hbls like mkn 421 and mkn 501 ( if @xmath30 was @xmath31 , they should show @xmath32 )",
    "this is in contrast with observations , unless assuming a dependence of the source parameters on redshift such that the corresponding features always disappear due to ebl absorption .",
    "it is difficult to justify such a fine - tuning on a relatively small redshift range , even assuming an evolution of blazar properties .",
    "though the sample of objects is still too limited to settle this issue definitively , growing data seem to corroborate this conclusion . figure 7 shows the observed photon indices of all tev blazars detected so far as a function of redshift , in comparison with the expected index for a @xmath25 intrinsic spectrum .",
    "if the ebl density is high , the very strong dependence on redshift would require a dramatic change of properties between tev blazars at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with all 4 farther objects showing such hard features ( which would thus seem rather common ) and none of the 8 closer objects .",
    "there seems to be no reason why the jet emission mechanisms in blazars should know the level of the ebl with such precision .",
    "a low ebl level instead , close to the galaxy counts limit , does not impose such difference , making the tev properties similar among different hbls in this redshift range , as observed in all the other energy bands of the seds .",
    "a straightforward step to test this conclusion is to look for independent evidence that hbls can indeed have much harder tev spectra than assumed .",

    "7 ) , could reveal objects whose reconstructed spectrum is still very hard even with an ebl flux as low as the galaxy counts limit .",
    "this would provide evidence for intrinsically hard spectra , though in such case the possibility of exotic scenarios invoking a modification of the physics of the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction would not be formally excluded . with a low ebl level , objects at z=0.4 - 0.5",

    "figure 8 shows the optical depth expected for a source at z=0.5 using the ebl model by @xcite , when scaled down to match the ebl upper limits .",
