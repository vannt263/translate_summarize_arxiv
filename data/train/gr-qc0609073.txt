    "over the last few years , the zoo of cosmological singularities considered in the literature has been considerably expanded , with  big rips \" and  sudden singularities \" added to the `` big bang '' and  big crunch \" , as well as renewed interest in non - singular cosmological events such as  bounces \" and  turnarounds \"  @xcite .",
    "we consider a cosmological spacetime of the frw form and assume applicability of the einstein equations of general relativity .",
    "we will provide a generic definition of all the physically relevant singularities considered above ( which we shall refer to as cosmological milestones ) , using generalized puisieux series for the scale factor of the universe @xmath0 .",
    "we will show that , most importantly , _ all _ physical observables ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , the riemann tensor , _ etc _ ... ) will likewise be described by a generalized puisieux series .    -15pt",
    "solutions of differential equations can often be expanded in taylor series or laurent series around their singular points .",
    "we shall extend this idea by expanding the scale factor @xmath0 in generalized power series , similar to a puisieux series , in the vicinity of the cosmological milestones .",

    "we will assume that in the vicinity of the milestone the scale factor has a ( possibly one - sided ) generalized power series expansion of the form @xmath4 where the indicial exponents @xmath5 are generically real ( and are often non - integer ) and without loss of generality are ordered in such a way that they satisfy @xmath6 finally we can also without loss of generality set @xmath7 .",
    "there are no _ a priori _ constraints on the signs of the other @xmath8 , though by definition @xmath9 .",
    "the first term of the right hand side of equation ( [ e : power ] ) is the dominant term , and is therefore responsible for the convergence or divergence of the scale factor at the time @xmath3 .",
    "the indices @xmath5 are used to classify the cosmological milestones and the absolute value symbols are used to distinguish a past event from a future event .",
    "this generalized power series expansion of the scale factor is sufficient to represent almost all the physical models that we are aware of in the literature .",
    "table [ table1 ] represents this cosmological milestone classification depending on the value of the scale factor .",
    ".classification of cosmological milestones [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    note that sudden singularities are of order @xmath10 where the @xmath11 derivative of the scale factor is the first one that is infinite : @xmath12 and therefore @xmath13 has to be a non - integer  @xcite .",
    "note that for most calculations it is sufficient to use the first three ( or fewer ) terms of the power series expansion .",
    "we have exhibited a generic expansion of the scale factor @xmath0 based on generalized power series for all the physically relevant cosmological milestones found in the literature to date ( big bang , big crunch , sudden singularity , extremality events and big rip ) .",
    "we can now use the parameters of this series to explore the kinematical and dynamical properties of the cosmological milestones , for example , to see whether they are true curvature singularities or whether the energy conditions hold in the vicinity of the time of the event @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , on a kinematical level , we can analyze the hubble parameter for finiteness in the vicinity of the cosmological milestones . keeping the most dominant terms , we have for @xmath14 : @xmath15 that is , for bangs , crunches , and rips the hubble parameter exhibits a generic @xmath16 blow up .      on a dynamical level , we can quantify how  strange \" physics gets in the vicinity of a cosmological milestone by introducing the friedmann equations and the standard energy conditions in general relativity  which are the _ null _ , _ weak _ , _ strong _ , and _",
    "dominant _ energy conditions  @xcite .",
    "the density and pressure are given as a function of the scale factor @xmath0 and can therefore likewise be power series . whether or not a specific energy condition is satisfied is simply a matter of calculating the dominant indicial exponents of the series expansion ( full details provided in  @xcite ) .",
    "to conclude , if in the vicinity of any cosmological milestone , the input scale factor @xmath0 is a generalized power series , then all physical observables ( _ e.g. _ @xmath1 , @xmath2 , the riemann tensor , _",
    "etc_. ) will likewise be a generalized puisieux series . by checking the related indicial exponents , which can be calculated from the indicial exponents of the scale factor , one can determine whether or not the particular physical observable then diverges at the cosmological milestone .",
