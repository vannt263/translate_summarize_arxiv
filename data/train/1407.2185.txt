    "also better understand their role in initiating prebiotic chemistry on the early earth through delivery of water and organic matter by cometary impacts @xcite .",
    "comets are primarily located in two distinct reservoirs of the solar system : the oort cloud and the kuiper belt .",
    "the oort cloud is a source of long - period comets and ( probably ) halley - type comets @xcite .",

    "+ important cosmogonic quantities for the investigation of primordial constitutions ( such as the @xmath10 and d / h ratios ) , can be obtained by observations of comets from ground - based , space - based and airborne observatories @xcite , as well as from laboratory analyses of cometary ( interplanetary ) dust particles collected in the stratosphere @xcite .",
    "these data provide measurements of chemical composition , isotopic ratios and molecular spin ratios , which are important to help establish the contribution of the solar system s natal molecular cloud to the compositions of primitive materials and comets .",
    "in addition , isotopic ratios such as d / h can be compared with the value for the earth s ocean water to investigate the possible importance of cometary water delivery .",
    "comet rendezvous space missions to individual comets present unique scientific opportunities .",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16 spacecraft observations of several comets have allowed their nuclei to be imaged and the gas and dust properties of their comae to be studied in great detail .",
    "these include : 1p / halley @xcite ; 81p / wild 2 @xcite ; 9p / tempel @xcite ; 103p / hartley 2 @xcite ; and the current rosetta mission to 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko @xcite .",
    "ground - based observing campaigns have also played an important role in support of space missions @xcite and , in the case of 81p / wild 2 , laboratory analyses of the returned stardust samples have yielded unique insights into the nature of cometary dust @xcite .",
    "comet 103p / hartley 2 ( hereafter 103p ) is a jupiter - family comet , with a short orbital period ( 6.5 years ) , and a low orbital inclination .",
    "it was the target of the nasa epoxi mission @xcite .",
    "the comet passed perihelion on 2010 october 28 at @xmath17 = 1.059 au and on 2010 october 21 made an exceptionally close approach to earth at @xmath18 = 0.12 au . in support of the epoxi mission , we conducted observations at radio and submillimeter wavelengths of comet 103p in the three weeks preceding the spacecraft rendezvous on ut 2010 november 4.58 . here",
    "we report detections of hcn , @xmath0 , cs , and oh and upper limits for hnc and dcn , using the 12 m arizona radio observatory kitt peak ( 12 m ) and the 10 m submillimeter telescope ( smt ) , as well as the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and the 100 m robert c. byrd greenbank telescope ( gbt ) . we present the observational results and determine physical parameters such as column densities , and production rates .",
    "finally , the @xmath10 ratio has been derived from @xmath0 , and an upper limit on the d / h ratio was obtained from dcn and hcn measurements .",
    "comet 103p / hartley 2 was discovered on 1984 june 4 by malcolm hartley at the siding spring observatory @xcite .",
    "103p has been frequently observed over the 30 years following its discovery , both by ground - based and space telescopes .",

    "observations of comet 103p were made between 2010 october 13 and october 31 for monitoring emission from the oh : j = 3/2 , @xmath19=3/2 , f=@xmath20-@xmath21 ( 1667.3 mhz/18 cm ) lines at l - band ( program i d gbt/10c-059 ) .",
    "a barycentric velocity reference frame was assumed for all observations .",
    "the line of sight radial velocity on each day recorded by the jpl ephemeris was then subtracted from the data to set each spectral feature to a 0 km @xmath4 cometocentric velocity .",
    "the gbt spectrometer was configured in its eight intermediate - frequency ( if ) , 12.5 mhz three - level mode , which enabled observing four 12.5 mhz frequency bands simultaneously in two polarizations through the use of offset oscillators in the if .",
    "antenna temperatures were recorded on the @xmath22 scale @xcite with estimated 20@xmath6 uncertainties .",
    "data were taken in the off - on position - switching mode , with the off position 60 east in azimuth with respect to the on - source position .",
    "a single scan consisted of 2 minutes in the off - source position followed by 2 minutes in the on - source position .",

    "the 1 mm observations were carried out at the smt with a dual - polarization alma band 6 receiver system , employing sideband - separating mixers with an image rejection of typically 1520 db .",
    "the backends employed were a 2048 channel 1 mhz filter bank used in parallel ( 2 @xmath2 1024 ) mode , and 250 khz filter also in parallel ( 2 @xmath2 250 ) .",

    "data at both facilities were taken in position - switching mode with an off position 30 west in azimuth .",
    "the jpl ephemeris was used to determine the cometary position using the orbital elements .",
    "the pointing accuracy is estimated at 1  rms for the smt and 5  for the aro 12 m . focus and positional accuracy were checked periodically on nearby planets or masers .",
    "sub - millimeter spectroscopic observations of 103p ( programme",

    "harp is a 4 @xmath2 4 array receiver , but was used here in a single - receptor mode .",
    "harp is remotely and quickly tunable to frequencies in the 325 - 375ghz ranges and utilizes an image sideband suppressor .",
    "the output from the harp receiver is fed to the ` acsis ' digital autocorrelation spectrometer . for this work",

    "the harp receptors are separated by about 30  , and so the emission from the comet is anticipated to be encompassed by a single receptor  the ` pointing ' receptor .",
    "pointing of the telescope is achieved by doing spectral - line ` five - points ' on nearby line sources , and pointing accuracy is estimated at 2 \" rms in each of two orthogonal coordinates ( azimuth and elevation ) .",
    "a pointing check was performed approximately every hour .",
    "telescope focus is similarly maintained throughout the night by measures of bright line - sources .",

    "this inversion value is given in table [ oh_results].the oh photodissociation lifetime ( @xmath53 ) is 1.2@xmath2 @xmath56 @xmath57 s ( taken from @xcite ) , and is used in the final production rate calculation , and we assume @xmath52 @xmath58 2.7 k. the measured intensity and line width of each transition is given in table [ obs_parameters ] . the @xmath49 value is then corrected by a factor @xmath59 , which is defined as the fraction of molecules in the coma that are contained within the gbt beam .",
    "we computed @xmath59 using a monte - carlo haser model @xcite for daughters molecules , assuming @xmath60 = 8.0 @xmath2 @xmath61 @xmath57 ( s ) @xcite , @xmath62 = 0.95 km @xmath63 and @xmath64 = 0.80 km @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "both the measured hdo/@xmath67 and dcn / hcn ratios are compatible with ion - molecule chemistry in gas at about 30 - 35 k. with this work we measured an upper limit for the dcn / hcn ratio of @xmath70.01 .",

    "molecules that contain multiple h atoms can be spectroscopically distinguished based on the orientation of the spins of their h nuclei , either aligned in parallel or anti - parallel states ( e.g. @xmath70 , @xmath0 , @xmath67 ) , giving rise to @xmath8 and @xmath9 forms .",

    "the cosmogonic significance of opr and spin temperature in comets is therefore not clear , and the lack of opr measurements for molecules with smaller @xmath72 energy deficiencies ( e.g. , @xmath0 and @xmath73 ) has further limited our understanding of this indicator in comets .",
    "the opr of h@xmath74co for hartley 2 was obtained from consecutive observations of the @xmath8-@xmath0 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath9-@xmath0 ( @xmath48 ) lines on november 2 from data obtained at the jcmt ( see table [ obs_parameters ] ) .",
    "the periodicity of the comet presents some uncertainty in abundances , though these two observations were in close enough proximity ( @xmath7 3 hrs ) .",

    "<S> here we report detections of hcn , @xmath0 , cs , and oh and upper limits for hnc and dcn towards 103p , using the arizona radio observatory kitt peak 12 m telescope ( aro 12 m ) and submillimeter telescope ( smt ) , the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and the greenbank telescope ( gbt ) . the water production rate , @xmath1 = ( 0.67 - 1.07 ) @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 , was determined from the gbt oh data . from the average abundance ratios of hcn and @xmath0 relative to water ( 0.13 @xmath5 0.03 @xmath6 and 0.14 @xmath5 0.03 @xmath6 , respectively ) , we conclude that @xmath0 is depleted and hcn is normal with respect to typically - observed cometary mixing ratios . </S>",
    "<S> however , the abundance ratio of hcn with water shows a large diversity with time . using the jcmt data we measured an upper limit for the dcn / hcn ratio @xmath70.01 . </S>",
    "<S> consecutive observations of @xmath8-@xmath0 and @xmath9-@xmath0 on november 2 ( from data obtained at the jcmt ) , allowed us to derive an @xmath10 ratio ( opr ) @xmath11 2.12 @xmath5 0.59 ( 1@xmath12 ) , corresponding to @xmath13 @xmath14 8 k ( 2@xmath12 ) . </S>"
