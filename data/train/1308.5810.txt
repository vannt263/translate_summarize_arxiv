    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) are dynamically active systems , where stellar interactions and collisions , especially those involving binaries , are quite frequent ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and generate populations of exotic objects , like x - ray binaries , millisecond pulsars , and blue straggler stars ( bsss ; e.g. , @xcite , 2009;@xcite ) . among these objects ,",
    "bsss are the most abundant and therefore may act as a crucial probe of the interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they are brighter and bluer ( hotter ) than main sequence ( ms ) turnoff ( to ) stars and are located along an extrapolation of the ms in the optical color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "thus , they mimic a rejuvenated stellar population , with masses larger than those of normal cluster stars ( @xmath4 ; this is also confirmed by direct measurements ; @xcite ) .",
    "this clearly indicates that some process which increases the initial mass of single stars must be at work",
    ". the most probable formation mechanisms of these peculiar objects are thought to be either the mass transfer ( mt ) activity between binary companions , even up to the complete coalescence of the system  @xcite , or the merger of two single or binary stars driven by stellar collisions ( col ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , it is still a quite hard task to distinguish bsss formed by either channel .",
    "the most promising route seems to be high resolution spectroscopy , able to identify chemical anomalies ( as a significant depletion of carbon and oxygen ) on the bss surface ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as it is expected in the mt scenario .",
    "also the recent discovery of a double sequence of bsss in m30 @xcite seems to indicate that , at least in gcs that recently suffered the core collapse , col - bsss can be distinguished from mt - bsss on the basis of their position in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .    in general , since collisions are most frequent in high density regions , bsss in different environments could have different origins : those in loose gcs might arise from the coalescence / mass - transfer of primordial binaries , while those in high density clusters might form mostly from stellar collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite suggested that most bsss , even those observed in the cores of high density gcs , formed from binary systems , although no strong correlation between the number or specific frequency of bsss and that of binaries is found if all clusters ( including the post - core collapse ones ) are taken into account @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that dynamical processes significantly modify the binary and the bss content of gcs during their evolution .",
    "an exception seems to be represented by low density environments , where the efficiency of dynamical interactions is expected to be negligible . very interestingly , indeed , a clear correlation between the binary and the bss frequencies has been found in a sample of 13 low density gcs @xcite .",
    "this remains the cleanest evidence that the unperturbed evolution of primordial binaries is the dominant bss formation process in low - density environments ( also consistently with the results obtained in open clusters ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most notable effects of stellar dynamics on bsss is the shaping of their radial distribution within the host cluster . in most cases",
    "a clear bimodality has been observed in the radial distribution of the @xmath5 ratio ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 being , respectively , the number of bsss and the number of stars belonging to a reference population , as red giant or horizontal branch stars ) : such a ratio shows a high peak at the cluster centre , a dip at intermediate radii and a rising branch in the external regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a few other gcs ( see , for example , ngc 1904 and m75 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) the radial distribution shows a clear central peak but no upturn in the external cluster regions . in the case of @xmath8centauri @xcite , ngc 2419 @xcite and palomar 14 @xcite",
    "the bss radial distribution is flat all over the entire cluster extension .",
    "since bsss are more massive than the average cluster stars ( and therefore suffer from the effects of dynamical friction ) , these different observed shapes have been interpreted as due to different `` dynamical ages '' of the host clusters ( * ? ? ? * hereafter f12 ) : a flat bss distribution is found in dynamically young gcs ( _ family i _ ) , where two - body relaxation has been ineffective in establishing energy - equipartition in a hubble time and dynamical friction has not segregated the bss population yet . in clusters of intermediate ages ( _ family ii _ ) , the innermost bsss have already sunk to the center , while the outermost ones are still evolving in isolation ( this would produce the observed bimodality ) ; finally , in the most evolved gcs ( _ family iii _ ) , dynamical friction has already segregated toward the centre even the most remote bsss , thus erasing the external rising branch of the distribution .",
    "these results demonstrate that the bss radial distribution can be used as powerful dynamical clock . of course",
    ", the same should hold for binary systems with comparable masses , but the identification of clean and statistically significant samples of binaries all over the entire cluster extension is a quite hard task and no investigations have been performed to date to confirm such an expectation .",
    "ngc5466 is a high galactic latitude gc ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , located in the constellation of botes at a distance of @xmath11 kpc  @xcite .",
    "the cluster has been recently found to be surrounded by huge tidal tails  @xcite .",
    "the bss stars in this cluster were first studied by  @xcite , and , more recently ,  @xcite analyzed the bss population inside the first @xmath12 from the cluster center . since the cluster tidal radius is @xmath13  @xcite , a survey of the bss population over the whole body of the cluster is still missing . in the framework of the study of the origin of the bss , it is important to mention that ngc  5466 is the first gc where eclipsing binaries were found among the bss  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also kryachko et al.(2011 ) ) .",
    "in their paper  @xcite find indications that all the bss in ngc 5466 were formed from the merger of the components of primordial , detached binaries evolved into compact binary systems .    in this paper",
    "we intend to study the bss and binary populations of ngc  5466 , focussing in particular on their radial distribution within the whole cluster to investigate its dynamical age .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_obs ]",

    "the photometric data used here consist of a combination of shallow and deep images ( see table  1 ) acquired through the blue channel of the large binocular camera ( lbc - blue ) mounted on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) , megacam on the canadian - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .    _ ( i)the lbc data - set _ :",

    "a set of short exposures ( of 5 , 60 and 90 seconds ) was secured in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 filters with the cluster center positioned in the central chip ( namely # 2 ) of the lbc - blue ccd mosaic .",
    "deep images ( of 400 and 200 s in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands , respectively ) were obtained with the lbc - blue fov positioned @xmath25 south from the cluster centre .",
    "a dithering pattern was adopted in both cases thus to fill the gaps of the ccd mosaic .",

    "mounted at cfht ( hawaii ) , the wide - field imager megacam ( built by cea , france ) , consists of 36 @xmath28 pixel ccds ( a total of 340 megapixels ) , fully covering a 1 degree @xmath29 1 degree fov with a resolution of 0.187 arcsecond / pixel .",
    "the data were preprocessed ( removal of the instrumental signature ) and calibrated ( photometry and astrometry ) by elixir pipeline .    _",
    "( iii)the acs data - set _ consists of a set of high - resolution , deep images obtained with the acs on board the hst through the f606w and f814w filters ( go-10775;pi : sarajedini ) .",
    "the cluster was centered in the acs field and observed with one short and five long - exposures per filter , for a total of two orbits .",
    "we retrieved and used only the deep exposures ( see table [ tab_obs ] ) .",
    "all images were passed through the standard acs / wfc reduction pipeline .",
    "as shown in the left panel of figure [ maps ] , the shallow lbc data - set is used to sample a region of @xmath30 around the cluster center , and for @xmath31 it is complemented with the megacam observations , which extend beyond the tidal radius , out to @xmath32 . in the following the combination of these two data - sets will be referred to as the `` shallow sample '' and adopted to study the bss population over the entire cluster extension ( see sect . [ sec_bss ] ) .",
    "the acs observations sample the innermost @xmath33 of the cluster and they are complemented with the deep lbc observations , extending out to @xmath34 ( see right panel of figure [ maps ] ) : this will be called the `` deep sample '' and used to investigate the binary fraction of ngc 5466 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec_bin ] ) .      given the very low crowding conditions in the external cluster regions , we performed aperture photometry on the two @xmath26 and @xmath27 megacam images , by using sextractor @xcite with an aperture diameter of @xmath35 ( corresponding to a fwhm of 5 pixels ) .",
    "each of the 36 chips was reduced separately , and we finally obtained a catalog listing the relative positions and magnitudes of all the stars in common between the @xmath26 and @xmath27 catalogs . the lbc and acs data - sets were reduced through a standard point spread function ( psf ) fitting procedure , by using daophotii / allstar  @xcite .",
    "the psf was independently modeled on each image using more than 50 isolated and well sampled stars in the field .",
    "the photometric catalogs of each pass - band were combined , and the instrumental magnitudes were reported to a reference frame following the standard procedure ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magnitudes of stars successfully measured in at least three images per filter were then averaged , and the error about the mean was adopted as the associated photometric uncertainty .    in order to obtain an absolute astrometric solution for each of the 36 megacam chips , we used more than 15000 stars in common with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) catalog covering an area of 1 square degree centered on the cluster .",

    "global accuracy is of @xmath36 , both in right ascension ( @xmath37 ) and declination ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the same technique applied to the lbc sample gave an astrometric solution with similar accuracy ( @xmath39 r.m.s . ) .",
    "considering that no standard astrometric stars can be found in the very central regions of the cluster , we used the stars in the lbc catalog as _ secondary astrometric standards _ and we thus determined an absolute astrometric solution for the acs sample in the core region with the same accuracy obtained in the previous cases .",
    "a sample of bright isolated stars in the acs data - set was used to transform the acs instrumental magnitudes to a fixed aperture of @xmath40 .",
    "the extrapolation to infinite and the transformation into the vegamag photometric system was then performed using the updated values listed in tables 5 and 10 of @xcite . in order to transform the instrumental @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes of the lbc sample into the johnson / kron - cousins standard system",
    ", we used the stars in common with a photometric catalog previously published by @xcite .",
    "these authors , in section 2.3 of their paper , provide a thorough comparison of their photometry with existing literature datasets , finding a satisfactory agreement . in particular they found an excellent agreement in the photometric zero - points ( within less than 0.02 mag ) and no residual trends with colors with the set of secondary standards by  @xcite , that should be considered as the most reliable reference .",
    "we verified , by direct comparison with stetson ( 2000 ) , that the quality of the agreement shown by @xcite is fully preserved in our final catalog .    instead",
    ", the @xmath26 and @xmath27 magnitudes in the megacam sample were calibrated using the stars in common with the sdss catalog and we then adopted the equation that robert lupton derived by matching dr4 photometry to peter stetson s published photometry for stars to transform the calibrated @xmath26 and @xmath27 into a @xmath24 magnitude .",
    "we finally used more than 2000 stars in common between the lbc and the megacam data - sets to search for any possible off - sets between the @xmath24 magnitude in the two catalogs , finding an average systematic difference of 0.014 mag .",
    "we therefore applied this small correction to the megacam catalog .",
    "similarly , we used more than 200 stars in common between the acs data - set and the lbc catalog to calibrate the acs f606w magnitude to the johnson @xmath24 magnitude .",
    "such a procedure therefore provided us with a homogenous @xmath24 magnitude scale in common to all the available data - sets .",
    "the cmd obtained from the shallow lbc exposures for the innermost @xmath30 from the cluster center is shown in figure  [ cmd_shallow ] .",
    "typical photometric errors ( magnitudes and colors ) are indicated by black crosses .",
    "the high quality of the images allows us to accurately sample all the bright evolutionary sequences , from the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , down to @xmath41 magnitudes below the ms - to , with a large population of bsss well visible at @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    in figure [ cmd_deep ]",
    "we show the cmds obtained from the acs and the deep lbc observations . as in figure",
    "[ cmd_shallow ] , the typical photometric errors ( magnitudes and colors ) for the two sample are indicated by black crosses .",
    "a well populated ms is visible in the acs cmd , extending from the ms - to ( @xmath44 ) down to @xmath45 .",
    "once again , the collecting power of the lbt combined with the lbc - blue imaging capabilities allowed us to sample the ms down to similar magnitudes in an area extending out to the cluster s tidal radius . for @xmath46",
    "the plume of galactic m dwarfs is clearly visible , while for @xmath47 and @xmath48 a population of unresolved background ( possibly extended ) objects is apparent . in both",
    "the cmds a well defined sequence of unresolved binary systems is observed on the red side of the ms .",
    "the shallow sample was used to determine the cluster center of gravity ( @xmath49 ) and the projected density profile from accurate star counts , following the procedure already adopted and described , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath49 is @xmath50 , @xmath51 , in full agreement with that quoted by @xcite .",
    "the best fit king model to the observed density profile has concentration parameter @xmath52 , core radius @xmath53 and tidal radius @xmath54  @xcite . ) . while the latter is formally more correct , we keep referring to the tidal radius for sake of continuity with our previous papers about the bss populations in gcs ( see f12 and references therein ) . ]",
    "@xcite studied the radial distribution of the bss population in ngc 5466 , from the cluster centre out to @xmath12 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they selected 89 bsss and showed that they are significantly more centrally concentrated than rgb and horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , but they did not find any evidence of upturn in the external regions .",
    "however , that study did not sample the entire radial extension of the cluster , while our previous experience demonstrates that even a few bsss in the outer regions can generate the external rising branch .",
    "hence , a detailed investigation even in the most remote regions is necessary before solidly excluding the presence of an upturn in the bss radial distribution and confirming the dynamical age of the cluster .",
    "the selection of the bss population was primarily performed in the @xmath55 plane ( see open circles in figure [ cmd_bss ] , left panel ) , by adopting conservative limits in magnitude and color in order to avoid the possible contamination from stellar blends . the bss selection has been then `` exported '' to the megacam @xmath56 cmd by using the bsss in common between the two data - sets in the region at @xmath57 ( see right hand panel ) .",
    "we finally count a population of 88 stars in the lbc sample and 9 stars in the megacam one , for a total of 97 bsss spanning the entire radial extent of the cluster .",
    "the cross - correlation of our sample with that of @xcite confirms that the majority of the stars selected in the previous work are real bsss , but 18 of them are blended sources . in order to further test the completeness of our lbc shallow sample we performed a detailed comparison with the acs photometric catalogue of @xciteata / public_hstgc/ ] .",
    "the completeness has been quantified as the fraction of stars in common between the two catalogs in a given magnitude interval : we find 93% , 95% , and 100% completness for stars with @xmath58 , 21.5 , and 21 , respectively .    for a meaningful study of the bss population ,",
    "a reference sample of `` normal '' cluster stars has to be defined .",
    "here we choose a post - ms population composed of sub - giant ( sgb ) and red giant branch stars ( rgb ; see grey triangles in fig .",
    "[ cmd_bss ] ) .",
    "this has been selected in the same magnitude range ( @xmath59 ) of bsss , thus guaranteeing that the photometric completeness is the same in both samples .",
    "we count 1358 and 96 stars in the lbc and megacam data - sets , respectively .",
    "as extensively illustrated in literature ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the study of the bss radial distribution is a very powerful tool to shed light on the internal dynamical evolution of gcs and possibly gets some hints on the bss formation mechanisms .    as a first step",
    ", we compared the cumulative radial distribution of the selected bss population to that of reference stars ( see figure [ ks ] ) .",
    "clearly , bsss are more centrally concentrated , and a kolmogorov - smirnov test yields a probability of @xmath60 that the two samples are not extracted from the same parent population .",
    "this cumulative bss distribution closely resembles that already observed in this cluster by @xcite out to @xmath61 ( see their figure 19 ) , with the only difference that we sample the entire cluster extension .",
    "moreover , the distributions shown in figure [ ks ] , closely resembles that observed in all gcs characterised by a bimodal radial distribution of bsss ( see , e.g. , the cases of m3 , @xcite , 47tuc , @xcite ; m53 , @xcite ; m5 , @xcite ) .    following the same procedure described in @xcite , as a second step we divided the surveyed area in a series of concentric annuli centred on @xmath49 . in table  2",
    "we report the values of the inner and outer radii of each annulus , together with the number of bsss ( @xmath6 ) and reference stars ( @xmath62 ) counted in each radial bin .",
    "we also report the fraction of light sampled in the same area , with the luminosity being calculated as the sum of the luminosities of all the stars measured in the to region at @xmath63 . the contamination of the cluster bss and rgb populations due to background and foreground field stars can be severe , especially in the external regions where number counts are low .",
    "we therefore exploited the wide area covered by megacam ( see figure [ maps ] ) to estimate the field contamination by simply counting the number of stars located beyond the cluster tidal radius ( at @xmath64 ) that populate the bss and rgb selection boxes in the cmd .",
    "we count 2 bsss and 13 rgb stars in a @xmath65 deg@xmath66 area .",
    "the corresponding densities are used to calculate the number of field stars expected to contaminate each population in every considered radial bin ( see numbers in parenthesis in table  2 ) .    in the upper panel of figure [ bss_rad ]",
    "we show the resulting trend of @xmath67 as a function of radius .",
    "clearly it is bimodal , with a relatively low peak of bsss in the inner region , a distinct dip at intermediate radii , and a constant value slightly smaller than the central one , in the outskirts .",
    "we identify the minimum of the radial distribution at @xmath68 .",
    "this behavior is further confirmed by the radial distribution of the bss double normalized ratio , @xmath69 ( see the black circles in the lower panel of figure [ bss_rad ] ) .    for each radial bin ,",
    "@xmath69 is defined as the ratio between the fraction of bsss in the annulus and the fraction of light sampled by the observations in the same bin ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the same quantity computed for the reference population turns out to be equal to one at any radial distance ( see grey regions in the figure ) .",
    "this is indeed expected from the stellar evolution theory @xcite and it confirms that the distribution of rgb stars follows that of the cluster sampled light . instead , @xmath69 shows a bimodal behavior , confirming the result obtained above .",
    "notice that ngc 5466 is one of the most sparsely populated galactic gcs , and so the number of cluster s stars and the fraction of sampled light in the external regions is quite low .",
    "binaries play an important role in the formation and dynamical evolution of gcs  @xcite . indeed these systems secure a enormous energy reservoir able to quench mass - segregation and delay or even prevent the collapse of the core . up to now",
    "three main techniques have been used to measure the binary fraction : _ ( i ) _ radial velocity variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ ( ii ) _ searches for eclipsing binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and _ ( iii ) _ studies of the distribution of stars along the cluster ms in cmd ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work",
    "we adopt the latter approach , which has the advantage of being more efficient for a statistical investigation , and unbiased against the orbital parameters of the systems .",
    "we followed the prescriptions extensively described in  @xcite and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also dalessandro et al .",
    "this method relies on the fact that the luminosity of a binary system is the result of the contributions of both ( unresolved ) companions . the total luminosity is therefore given by the luminosity of the primary ( having mass @xmath70 ) increased by that of the companion ( with mass @xmath71 ) .",
    "along the ms , where stars obey a mass - luminosity relation , the magnitude increase depends on the mass ratio @xmath72 , reaching a maximum value of 0.75 mag for equal mass binaries ( @xmath73 ) . taking advantage of the large fov covered by our data - sets , we analyzed the binary fraction at different radial distances from the cluster center , out to @xmath74 .      in order to estimate the fraction of binaries from the `` secondary '' ms in the cmd , it is crucial to have a realistic and robust measure of other possible sources of broadening of the ms ( e.g. blending , photometric errors ) .",
    "these factors are related to the quality of the data and can be properly studied through artificial star experiments .",
    "we therefore produced a catalog of artificial stars for the acs and lbc - deep data - sets , following the procedure described in  @xcite .",
    "as a first step , a list of input positions and magnitudes of artificial stars ( x@xmath75,y@xmath75,@xmath76 and @xmath77 ) is produced .",
    "once these stars are added to the original frames at the x@xmath75 and y@xmath75 positions , we repeat the measure of stellar magnitudes in the same way as described in section  [ photometry ] . at the end of this procedure",
    "we obtain a list of stars including both real and artificial stars . since we know precisely the positions and magnitudes of the artificial stars , the comparison of the latter with the measured @xmath78 and @xmath79 magnitudes , allow us to estimate the capability of our data - reduction strategy to properly detect stars in the images , including the effect of blending .    in practice , we first generated a catalog of simulated stars with a @xmath80 magnitude randomly extracted from a luminosity function modeled to reproduce the observed one .",
    "then the @xmath81 and @xmath77 magnitudes were assigned to each sampled @xmath80 magnitude by interpolating the mean ridge line of the cluster ( solid grey lines in the left and right panels of figure [ cmd_deep ] , for the acs and the lbc - deep samples , respectively ) .",
    "the artificial stars were then added on each frame using the same psf model calculated during the data reduction phase , and were spatially distributed on a grid of cells of fixed width ( 5 times larger than the mean fwhm of the stars in the frames ) .",
    "only one star was randomly placed in such a box in each run , in order not to generate artificial stellar crowding from the simulated stars on the images .",
    "the artificial stars were added to the real images using the daophot / addstar routine . at the end of this step",
    ", we have a number of `` artificial '' frames ( which include the real stars and the artificial stars with know position in the frame ) equal to the number of observed frames .",
    "the reduction process was repeated on the artificial images in exactly the same way as for the scientific ones .",
    "a total of 100,000 stars were simulated on each data - set and photometric completeness ( @xmath82 ) was then calculated as the ratio between the number of stars recovered by the photometric reduction ( @xmath83 ) and the number of simulated stars ( @xmath84 ) .    in figure [ compl ] , we show the photometric completeness estimated for the acs and the lbc - deep data - sets ( upper and lower panels , respectively ) as a function of the @xmath24 magnitude and for different radial regions around the cluster center .",
    "the completeness of the acs sample is above 80% for all magnitudes down to @xmath85 ( i.e. , @xmath86 magnitudes below the cluster to ) , even in the innermost region . on the other hand ,",
    "a completeness above 50% down to @xmath87 is guaranteed only at @xmath3 in the lbc - deep data - set .",
    "instead , stellar crowding is so strong at lower radial distances ( region d ) that the completeness stays below @xmath88 at all magnitudes .",
    "we therefore exclude this region ( @xmath89 ) from our study of the cluster binary fraction .",
    "as mentioned at the beginning of section  [ sec_bin ] , our estimation of the binary fraction in ngc  5466 is performed by determining the fraction of binaries populating the area between the ms and a @xmath90 ms , blue - ward shifted in colour by @xmath91  @xcite .    as a first step of our analysis",
    ", we measured the minimum binary fraction , i.e. the fraction of binaries with mass ratios large enough ( @xmath92 ) that they can be clearly distinguished from single ms stars in the cmd .",
    "when @xmath93 approaches the null value , the shift in magnitude of the primary star ( i.e. the more massive one ) is negligible .",
    "for this reason binary systems with small values of @xmath93 becomes indistinguishable from ms stars when photometric errors are present .",
    "clearly , this is a lower limit to the total binary fraction of the cluster .",
    "however , it has the advantage of being a pure observational quantity , since it is calculated without any assumption on the distribution of mass ratios  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude interval in which the minimum binary fraction has been estimated is @xmath94 for both the acs and the lbc samples .",
    "according to a 12 gyr model from  @xcite = -2.22 , distance modulus @xmath95 and adopting a reddening , @xmath96 @xcite . ]",
    ", this corresponds to a mass range @xmath97 for a single star on the ms . in this interval",
    "the photometric completeness @xmath98 is larger than @xmath99 for both samples . for the magnitude and radial intervals just defined",
    ", we divided the entire fov in four annuli ( see table  3 for details ) .",
    "then , the location of @xmath100 was estimated on the cmd as the value corresponding to a color difference of three times the photometric error from the ms ridge mean line ( grey solid lines in the cluster s cmds shown in figure [ cmd_deep ] ) .",
    "this approach allows us to define an area on the cmd safe from contamination from single mass stars .",
    "we notice that for each of the four annuli , this color difference corresponds to @xmath101 .",
    "the contamination from blended sources was calculated on the same region of the cmd by adopting the catalogue of artificial stars produced with the completeness tests ( see section  [ sec_compl ] ) .",
    "a catalogue of stars from the galaxymodel of  @xcite was used to estimate the field contamination .",
    "we thus estimated @xmath102 independently for the four radial intervals using the same approach described in @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ bin ] ( upper panel ) , we find that @xmath102 is almost constant and equal to @xmath103 for @xmath104 ( i.e. , within the acs sample ) , then it drops at @xmath105 at distances larger than @xmath106 ( in the lbc sample ) .",
    "as described above , the minimum binary fraction has the advantage of being measured with no arbitrary assumptions about the mass ratio distribution @xmath107 .",
    "it depends , however , on the photometric accuracy of the used data - sets , and caution must be exercised when comparing the minimum binary fractions estimated for different gcs and in different works .",
    "an alternative approach consists in measuring the global fraction of binaries ( @xmath108 ) , that can be obtained by simulating a binary population which follows a given distribution @xmath107 , and by comparing the resulting synthetic cmd with the observed one .",
    "we already adopted this technique in  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hence , we refer to these papers for details . in brief , in order to simulate the binary population we randomly extracted @xmath109 values of the mass of the primary component from a @xcite initial mass function , and @xmath109 values of the binary mass ratio from the @xmath107 distribution observed by @xcite in the solar neighborhood , thus also obtaining the mass of the secondary .",
    "we considered the same magnitude limits and radial intervals used before .",
    "for each adopted value of the input binary fraction @xmath110 ( assumed to range between 0 and 15% with a step of 1% ) , we produced 100 synthetic cmds .",
    "then , for each value of @xmath110 the penalty function @xmath111 was computed and a probability @xmath112 was associated to it ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the mean of the best fitting gaussian is the global binary fraction @xmath113 .",
    "the values obtained in the four considered radial bins are listed in table  3 .",
    "the radial distribution of @xmath113 well resembles that obtained for the minimum binary fraction , remaining flat at @xmath114 in the innermost @xmath115 and decreasing to @xmath116 in the two outermost annuli .",
    "we have investigated the radial distribution of bsss and binary systems in the galactic gc ngc 5466 , sampling the entire cluster extension .",
    "this has been possible thanks to a proper combination of lbc - blue and megacam observations , and deep acs and lbc - blue data , respectively .",
    "the bss radial distribution has been found to be bimodal , as in the majority of gcs investigated to date ( see f12 and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , our data - set allowed us to detect a `` rising branch '' in the external portion of the bss distribution that was not identified in previous investigations because of a too limited sample in radius ( @xmath117 * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "following the f12 classification , ngc 5466 therefore belongs to _ family ii_. the minimum of the distribution is a quite prominent , purely observational feature , that , it in the light of the results published by f12 , can be used to investigate the dynamical age of ngc 5466 .",
    "it is located at @xmath118 , corresponding to only @xmath119 .",
    "this is the second most internal location of the minimum , after that of m53 .",
    "hence , ngc 5466 is one of the dynamically youngest clusters of _ family ii _ , where bsss have just started to sink toward the center of the system .",
    "the relatively low central peak of the bss distribution ( @xmath120 ; see fig .",
    "[ bss_rad ] ) is also consistent with this interpretation . as a further check , we calculated the core relaxation time ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "f12 shows that @xmath122 is proportional to @xmath123 ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath121 has been computed by using equation ( 10 ) of @xcite , adopting the new cluster structural parameters reported in section [ sec_cmd ] . in figure",
    "[ clock ] we show the position of ngc 5466 ( black solid circle ) on the `` dynamical clock plane '' ( @xmath124 as a function of @xmath125 ; figure 4 in f12 ) , where @xmath126 is the age of the universe ( @xmath126 = 13.7 gyr ) .",
    "clearly , this cluster nicely follows the same relation defined by the sample analyzed in f12 ( see also @xcite ) , further confirming that the shape of the observed bss distribution is a good measure of gc dynamical ages .",
    "this figure also confirms that ngc 5466 is one of the youngest cluster of _ family ii _ , meaning that only recently the action of dynamical friction started to segregate bsss ( and primordial binary systems of similar total mass ) toward the cluster centre . in this scenario ,",
    "the most remote bsss are thought to be still evolving in isolation in the outer cluster regions .",
    "the central values of the derived binary fractions ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) are slightly smaller than those quoted by @xcite .",
    "this is due to the differences in the adopted data reduction procedures and the consequent completeness analysis results , as well as the assumed luminosity functions .",
    "the value of @xmath102 is in very good agreement with the estimate obtained in the same radial range by @xcite from the same acs data - sets : @xmath129 ( see their figure 34 and the innermost open triangle in fig .",
    "[ bin ] ) . instead",
    ", our total binary fraction is significantly lower than that quoted by ( * ? ? ? * @xmath130 ) because of the different assumptions made about the shape of @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , these authors assumed a constant mass - ratio distribution for all @xmath93 values , and their total binary fraction is simply twice the value of @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , the measure of @xmath113 is quite sensitive to the assumed mass - ratio distribution , as also demonstrated by the value ( 11.7% ) obtained by simulating binaries formed by random associations between stars of different masses @xcite .",
    "@xcite also provides the value of the minmum binary fraction abetween @xmath131 and @xmath132 from the cluster center : @xmath133% .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this estimate has been obtained by using only the most external fragments of the acs fov , corresponding to less than 5% of the total sampled area",
    "( this likely explains the large uncertainty quoted by the authors ) .",
    "keeping this caveat in mind , in light of the good agreement between our central value of @xmath102 and that measured by @xcite , we include their estimate in our analysis , thus sampling the intermediate region which is not covered by our data .",
    "very interestingly , the value computed by @xcite defines a minimum in the binary fraction radial distribution ( see the outer open triangle in fig .",
    "[ bin ] ) , thus implying that also the radial distribution of binaries seems to be bimodal in ngc 5466 .",
    "we stress that the investigated binary systems ( having primary star masses between 0.5 and @xmath134 ) are in a mass range consistent with that of bsss .",
    "indeed , within the uncertainties , also the position of the minimum of the binary radial distribution is in good agreement with that of the bss population .",
    "this result urges a confirmation through dedicated observations .",
    "in fact , we emphasize that this would be the first time that a similar feature is observed in a gc",
    ". it would further strengthen the interpretation proposed by f12 that the shape of the bss radial distribution ( and simialr mass objects ) is primarily sculpted by dynamical friction .",
    "moreover , it adds further support to the conclusions that the unperturbed evolution of primordial binaries could be the dominant bss formation process in low - density environments @xcite .                                                                                                                                                          @ccccc@ data - set & number of exposures & filter & exposure time & date of observations + & & & ( s ) & +   + lbc - blue & 1 & @xmath23 & 5 & 2007 - 06 - 17 + & 7 & @xmath23 & 90 & 2007 - 06 - 17 + & 1 & @xmath24 & 5 & 2007 - 06 - 17 + & 7 & @xmath24 & 60 & 2007 - 06 - 17 + megacam & 1 & @xmath26 & 90 & 2004 - 04 - 14 + & 1 & @xmath27 & 180 & 2004 - 04 - 14 +   + lbc - blue & 11 & @xmath23 & 400 & 2010 - 04 - 11 + & 15 & @xmath24 & 200 & 2010 - 04 - 11 +",
