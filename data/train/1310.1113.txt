    "among the most studied properties of nuclear fission of actinides are the distributions of mass and kinetic energy associated to complementary fragments @xcite .",
    "pleasonton found that the highest total kinetic energy is around 190 mev @xcite .",
    "however , those distributions are disturbed by neutron emission . in order to describe one of the consequences of neutron emission ,",
    "let us suppose that a nucleus with proton number @xmath5 and mass number @xmath6 splits into complementary light ( l ) and heavy ( h ) fragments corresponding to primary mass numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and proton numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 , having kinetic energies @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "after neutron emission , those fragments will end with mass numbers @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the numbers of neutrons emitted by the light and heavy fragments , respectively .",
    "the corresponding final kinetic energies associated to those fragments will be @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . at the lohengrin spectrometer at the high flux reactor ( hfr ) of the laue - langevin institute ( ill ) in grenoble ,",
    "only light fragments are detected , in which case subscripts are omitted .",
    "thus , for a given primary fragment mass number ( @xmath19 ) , the kinetic energy ( @xmath20 ) distribution is characterized by the corresponding average ( @xmath21 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath22 ) . in the case of reaction @xmath2u(@xmath1,f ) , r. brissot _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that neutron emission from fragments , occurred before they reach the detector , generates a peak around @xmath23 on the @xmath24 curve , non - existent on the @xmath21 curve . in order to avoid neutron emission effects , the cold fission region , corresponding to highest values of kinetic energy , was studied by c. signarbieux _",
    "they choose high kinetic energy windows associated to fragments from reactions @xmath0u(@xmath1,f ) , @xmath2u(@xmath1,f ) and @xmath3pu(@xmath1,f ) , respectively .",
    "the number of events analysed were 1.5@xmath2510@xmath26 , 3@xmath2510@xmath26 and 3.2@xmath2510@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "these authors used the difference of time of flight technique with solid detectors to measure the fragment kinetic energy .",
    "the experiment was conducted at the hfr of ill .",
    "they succeeded to separate neighboring masses , which was the evidence that no neutron emission occurred , which permitted them to measure the maximal total kinetic energy as a function of primary fragment mass , @xmath27 .",
    "+   + in order to reproduce those measured @xmath27 values , a scission point model is used .",
    "one assumes that the pre - scission kinetic energy is zero .",
    "thus , the maximal total kinetic energy is a result of coulomb repulsion between complementary fragments which begins at the scission point having the most compact configuration . +   + in general , the maximal total kinetic energy curve is lower that the maximal @xmath4-value ( @xmath28 ) curve .",
    "for instance , in the reaction @xmath0u(@xmath1,f ) , the maximal total kinetic energy of the fragment pair ( @xmath29kr , @xmath30xe ) is 3 mev lower than the corresponding @xmath4-value , which is reproduced by a configuration composed by the heavy fragment @xmath30xe in its spherical shape and the light fragment @xmath29kr in a deformed state with ellipsoidal parameter @xmath31 .",
    "however , the maximal total kinetic energy of the fragment pair ( @xmath32mo , @xmath33sn ) reaches the corresponding @xmath4-value , which is reproduced by a scission configuration conformed by the heavy fragment @xmath33sn in its spherical ground state , and the fragment @xmath32mo in its deformed ground state with an ellipsoidal parameter @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "+   + calculations of coulomb interaction energy ( @xmath35 ) shows that , among neighboring fragment masses corresponding to similar @xmath4-values , the lower is the light fragment charge ( @xmath36 ) , the higher will be maximal coulomb interaction energy ( @xmath37 , and , consequently , the higher will be the corresponding @xmath38 value .",
    "this named coulomb effect reproduces the observed fluctuations in experimental @xmath39 curves , with a period of 5 units of fragment mass , which is the average of the period of change in the fragment even charge that maximizes the @xmath4-value @xcite .",
    "+   + in this paper , experimental results on charge yield in cold fragmentations will be interpreted as a confirmation of the coulomb effect hypothesis .",
    "let us assume that the composed nucleus characterized by mass @xmath6 and charge @xmath5 splits into two fragments , the light of which has a mass number @xmath7 and a proton number @xmath9 . in a scission point model , the potential energy ( @xmath40 ) of a scission configuration is given @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total deformation energy of fragments , @xmath35 is the coulomb interaction energy between complementary fragments , and @xmath43 represents the deformed configuration shape .",
    "the scission configuration shapes are limited by the relation @xmath44 .",
    "+   + the coulomb interaction energy between two complementary hypothetical spherical fragments at scission configuration is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the electrical permittivity , @xmath47 is the electron charge , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the radio of light and heavy fragment , respectively , and @xmath50 is the distance between surfaces of fragments ( in this paper it is assumed that @xmath51 fm ) .",
    "the nucleus radio for each fragment is given by the relation @xmath52 fm .",
    "then , one can show that @xmath53 in order to see how this value change with the charge fragmentation asymmetry , let us take two cases of charge splits from fission of nucleus @xmath54u which has @xmath55 .",
    "the first case corresponding to @xmath56 for which the relative variation @xmath57 produced by changing to @xmath58 will be nearly zero ; and the second case , a much more asymmetric charge split , corresponding to @xmath59 , for which the variation @xmath57 produced by changing to @xmath60 will be approximately 3.5 mev .",
    "as one can see , the coulomb effect increases with asymmetry of charge split .",
    "+   + in general , the coulomb interaction energy between spherical fragments is higher than the @xmath61value .",
    "therefore , in a scission configuration , fragments must be deformed .",
    "let us assume that , for isobaric split @xmath7/@xmath8 , @xmath62 is the interaction coulomb energy between complementary fragments corresponding to light charge @xmath9 and scission configuration shape @xmath43 , with fragments nearly spherical .",
    "if one takes two isobaric splits with light fragment charges @xmath9 and @xmath63 , respectively , one obtains the relation @xmath64 from this relation , for the same shape of scission configuration , one can show that @xmath65 in consequence , if one assumes that @xmath66 one can show that @xmath67 see fig .",
    "actually , fragment deformation energy and coulomb interaction energy between fragments are limited by the @xmath4-value of the reaction .",
    "the maximal coulomb interaction energy corresponding to @xmath9 ( @xmath68 and the minimal value of deformation energy @xmath69 obeys the relation @xmath70 similarly , the relation corresponding to fragmentation with light fragment charge @xmath63 will be @xmath71 because @xmath42 increases with @xmath43 , one can show that @xmath72 then @xmath73 see fig .",
    "therefore , it is expected that among isobaric splits having similar @xmath4- values , the more asymmetric charge split will reach a more compact configuration , which corresponds to a lower deformation energy , a higher coulomb interaction energy and , in consequence , a higher maximal total kinetic energy .",
    "+   + it was shown evidences that the even - even fragments couple ( @xmath74mo , @xmath75sn ) reaches the @xmath4-value in the reaction @xmath0u(@xmath1,f )",
    ". however , fragment charge was not measured .",
    "nevertheless , the gap between the @xmath4-value corresponding to ( @xmath74mo , @xmath75sn ) and the other isobaric splits , respectively , is high enough to assume that the maximum value of the total kinetic energy is reached by this pair of fragments .",

    "moreover , they observed that only the odd charge split @xmath90 reach a `` true '' cold fission ( @xmath91 ) , while @xmath38 referred to the magic charge split @xmath92 is @xmath93 mev lower than the corresponding @xmath4-value [ 13 ] .",
