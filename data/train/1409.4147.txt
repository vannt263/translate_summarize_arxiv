    "large - scale spectroscopic galaxies surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ; @xcite ) survey , are well established and powerful tools for investigations of galaxy evolution",
    ". however , they are limited by only observing a single aperture in the centre of each galaxy , so are inherently unable to investigate the spatially distributed properties of galaxies .",
    "integral field spectrographs ( ifss ) provide the information missed by traditional fibre - based surveys .",
    "the spatially resolved spectroscopic data produced by an ifs can be used to measure diverse quantities such as rotation curves , spatial distributions of star formation , and radial variation in stellar populations . until recently , technical limitations made ifs observations difficult and time - consuming , limiting sample sizes to a few hundred at most , e.g. 260 in atlas-3d @xcite and @xmath0600 in califa @xcite",
    ".    a massive step forward is now being taken by instruments that can make ifs observations of multiple objects at once .",
    "the sydney ",
    "aao multi - object integral field spectrograph ( sami ) is one of the first of such instruments , with 13 integral field units ( ifus ) , each with a field of view of 15 , that can be deployed across a 1-degree patrol field @xcite .",
    "each ifu consists of a bundle of 61 optical fibres lightly fused to have a high ( @xmath075% ) filling factor @xcite .",
    "sami is installed on the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , feeding the existing aaomega spectrograph @xcite .",
    "for the first time , sami allows the rapid generation of large samples of ifs observations .",
    "the sami galaxy survey is an ongoing project using sami to obtain integral field spectroscopic data for @xmath03400 galaxies , with an expected completion date of mid-2016 . at the time of writing , @xmath01000 galaxies",
    "have been observed , including the pilot survey of @xmath0100 galaxies .",
    "early science investigations have included studies of galactic winds @xcite , the kinematic morphology ",
    "density relation @xcite , and star formation in dwarf galaxies ( richards et al . , mnras accepted ) ; see also the related contributions by j.  bland - hawthorn , l.m.r .",

    "the target galaxies for the sami galaxy survey are split into two samples : a field and group sample from the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey g09 , g12 and g15 fields , and a cluster sample from a set of eight galaxy clusters .",
    "the inclusion of a dedicated cluster sample extends the range of environmental densities to higher values than a simple mass- or luminosity - selected sample of galaxies would provide .",
    "full details of the target selection are provided in @xcite .",
    "the target selection for the gama regions , consisting of a tiered set of volume - limited samples , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : target_selection ] .",
    "the figure also marks the galaxies included in the early data release ( edr ) , discussed in section  [ sec : edr ] .          the initial steps in the sami data reduction , up to the production of row - stacked spectra ( rss ) ,",
    "are carried out using version 5.62 of 2dfdr . the dedicated sami pipeline",
    "@xcite then performs flux calibration using separate observations of spectrophotometric standard stars , and corrects for telluric absorption based on simultaneous observations of a secondary standard star in the galaxy field .",
    "the set of @xmath07 dithered frames in each field are then resampled onto a regular grid and combined to produce a pair of datacubes ( representing the blue and red arms of aaomega ) for each galaxy .",
    "[ fig : example_galaxy ] illustrates the finished product for a single galaxy , showing the nature and quality of the data obtained .",
    "the complete data reduction process is described in @xcite .     and @xmath1 .",
    "upper panel : flux for a central spaxel ( blue ) and one 375 to the north ( red ) .",
    "lower panels , from left to right : sdss @xmath2 image ; continuum flux map ( @xmath3ergs@xmath4@xmath5@xmath4 ) ; stellar velocity field ( kms@xmath4 ) ; h@xmath6 flux map ( @xmath3ergs@xmath4@xmath5 ) ; h@xmath6 velocity field ( kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "the two velocity fields are each scaled individually . for the stellar velocity map , only spaxels with per - pixel signal - to - noise ratio @xmath75 in the continuum are included .",
    "each panel is 18  square , with north up and east to the left .",
    "the grey circle in the second panel shows the fwhm of the psf . ]      a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the data produced by sami is presented in @xcite ; here we provide some key results .    through the use of dome flat fields we achieve a flat field accuracy of 0.51% in most of the blue arm and 0.30.4% in the red arm .",
    "we use a combination of cuar arc lamps and sky lines to achieve a wavelength calibration accuracy of @xmath80.1 pixels or better .",
    "the continuum sky emission is typically subtracted with an accuracy of @xmath01% .    comparing synthetic @xmath9 colours to established photometry",
    ", we find a mean offset of 0.043  mag ( sami data redder ) with standard deviation 0.040  mag .",
    "the observed @xmath10-band magnitudes have a mean offset of @xmath11  mag relative to sdss photometry ( sami data brighter ) , with a scatter of 0.27  mag , although a significant contribution to this scatter comes from difficulties in defining magnitudes for extended , irregular sources .",
    "the median full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the final point spread function in the datacubes is 21 , with a typical range from 15 to 30 .",
    "the sami galaxy survey is backed up by a wide range of ancillary datasets . by targetting the gama fields , we have available deep spectroscopic data as well as imaging from current and future surveys ranging from the uv to radio , including galex mis , vst kids , vista viking , wise , herschel - atlas , gmrt and askap @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic information is crucial for robustly defining the environments of the sami galaxy survey targets @xcite , while the multi - wavelength imaging data provides a wealth of information on processes ( e.g.  dust - obscured star formation , radio agn ) that may not be apparent in the optical data .",
    "the cluster sample also has a variety of ancillary data including archival x - ray observations from _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , and we have carried out a dedicated redshift survey to characterise the clusters and give robust classifications of cluster membership ( owers et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "we have recently made available a set of fully calibrated datacubes for 107 galaxies , forming the sami galaxy survey early data release ( edr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxies were selected from the gama regions of the survey . also available",
    "are the datacubes of the corresponding secondary standard stars and a table of ancillary data including quantities such as stellar mass , effective radius and surface brightness .",
    "all data can be downloaded from the sami galaxy survey edr website .",
    "the sami galaxy survey now includes @xmath01000 galaxies with ifs observations , and will grow to @xmath03400 galaxies by mid-2016 .",
    "this unique dataset is providing new insight into a broad range of topics in galaxy evolution , from star formation in dwarf galaxies to stellar kinematics in galaxy clusters . as the sample grows",
    ", further results will come into reach based on robust statistical analyses of the galaxy population , something that has rarely been possible with ifs data in the past . as a starting point",
    ", we have publicly released the datacubes for 107 galaxies , allowing the research community access for scientific investigations and preparation for the full dataset .",
