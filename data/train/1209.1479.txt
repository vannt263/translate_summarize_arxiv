    "<S> the number of messages sent is identical for all timesteps and therefore @xmath3 receives @xmath68 replies to messages sent in the previous timestep . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is the number of messages @xmath3 sends in response to messages received from others which again is a sum over contributions from the actions ( a)-(c ) : @xmath69 the terms on the right are respectively , requests from any node in the network ( distributed as @xmath70 ) , messages from existing contacts ( distributed as @xmath71 ) , and back - and - forth messages ( distributed as @xmath72 ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : alpha2 ] ) , @xmath76 and @xmath77 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq5 ] ) yields @xmath78 where we introduce @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> summing over @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 we get @xmath83 here the first three terms ( referred to as @xmath84 ) are messages sent to recipients selected according to @xmath71 and with mean degree @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the other terms , @xmath85 , are messages to recipients distributed according to the higher order distribution @xmath86 which has a mean @xmath87 and contribute significantly only for large @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean of the weighted recipient degree ( weighted by number of messages received ) is @xmath88 , which departs from @xmath37 when @xmath85 becomes appreciable ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the ratio of sent to received messages becomes @xmath90 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : sent_vs_rec ] ( inset ) , and @xmath96 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dunbar ] , nearly coincide . </S>",
    "<S> in fact @xmath97 is related to @xmath98 because nodes beyond @xmath98 have a reduced probability to form new links . to determine @xmath97 , consider the evolution of the nodes degree in the limit where all capacity is used for replying , hence @xmath99 . using that @xmath100 , we get @xmath101 which in turn yields @xmath102 . @xmath97 is found by solving this implicit equation . </S>",

    "<S> the parameters @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are determined by the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sent_vs_rec ] . from @xmath21 and @xmath111 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> larger @xmath12 increases the limit of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 is constrained by the offset at low @xmath113 and @xmath19 effects the skewness of the curve which follows from analysis of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : alpha2 ] ) and ( [ eq : delta ] ) . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dunbar ] shows the model prediction of @xmath114 and the corresponding email data . </S>",
    "<S> we complement our analysis with numerical computations . using a large number of nodes , @xmath115 , we iterate actions ( a)-(c ) until steady - state is reached . while the mean - field prediction ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rec_degree_vs_k ] and [ fig : dunbar ] ) is close to the numerical solution , some differences exist , e.g.  at small @xmath6 , @xmath116 is not a strict power - law in the numerical solution due to the discreteness of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> further , the simulation gives a smooth peak in @xmath95 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dunbar ] ) which is narrower than in the empirical data . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to slight overestimation of the repeated back - and - forth communication between well - connected nodes ( @xmath117 ) relative to the data . </S>",
    "<S> we have also simulated the information flow ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : markov ] ) and achieve similar results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the average local clustering coefficient of the empirical and simulated networks is relatively small , @xmath118 for both ( similar clustering coefficient @xmath119 @xcite and @xmath120 to @xmath121 have been reported for other communication networks @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further checked the robustness of the model to variations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion  _ the data were recorded over three months and the communication network is therefore a finite - time projection of the real network . </S>",
    "<S> the projection reduces the number of links . </S>",

    "<S> when observing only a single day , the probability for an out - link between @xmath3 to @xmath4 not to be active is @xmath123 . for @xmath124 days </S>",

    "<S> all recipients @xmath4 ( distributed as @xmath71 ) , the projected sender out - degree becomes @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly one can consider the projection of the mean recipient degree leading to a similar reduction in the degree for finite - time data . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider the data for the quarter period ( @xmath129 ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rec_degree_vs_k ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath130 and therefore @xmath131 hence less than half the links persist .    _ concluding remarks  _ the finite capacity of agents in social networks induces an upper limit on the number of possible interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a comprehensive model that reconciles structure and dynamics of networks with finite capacity agents that dynamically form or lose links . in agreement with a complete set of email data and results from other social networks @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , our model predicts a scale - free degree distribution up to a distinct scale - break induced by the capacity limit . </S>",
    "<S> further , as agents gain importance in the network , the per - link - activity first increases with node - degree , peaks at intermediate degrees and declines at large degrees . the model and data therefore support the hypothesis of a general limit on the number ( 150 - 250 ) of active social relations that an individual can maintain @xcite and is in agreement with empirical observations on social networks @xcite . </S>"
