    "entanglement is one of the most interesting properties of quantum system involving more than one subsystems @xcite . this holistic property , which involves non classical correlations among subsystems , is useful resource for many quantum processes including canonical ones : quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , and dense coding @xcite .",
    "it is also a necessary constituent for establishing the nonlocal behavior of quantum theory @xcite and hence finds applications in various device independent and measurement device independent information theoretic protocols @xcite .",
    "thus entanglement generation is important for several practical purposes .",
    "one way to generate entanglement is the _ premeasurement _ procedure .",
    "quantum measurement process is an interesting area of study for a long time @xcite .",
    "the first step of quantum measurement procedure is _ premeasurement _ which establishes correlation between measuring system and measurement apparatus @xcite .",
    "so , whenever some measurement is performed on a quantum system , there is a possibility that entanglement is generated between the system and the measurement device and entanglement generation in such a way attracted interest previously @xcite . on the other hand , in the recent past lot of efforts",
    "have been observed in studying different types of non classical correlations @xcite and hence the quantum measurement process has drawn renewed attention in creating such correlations @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors have shown that a von neumann measurement on a part of a composite quantum system unavoidably creates distillable entanglement between the measurement apparatus and the system if the state has nonzero quantum discord . in a more recent article @xcite , instead of a composite system ,",
    "the authors have considered a single system and they have addressed the scenario when complementary sequential measurements have been performed on the system to generate entanglement .",
    "they have obtained a lower bound of the entanglement created by the unitary interaction ( premeasurement ) between the system and the measurement apparatus used to measure the complementary observables sequentially .",
    "interestingly , this lower bound resembles a well - known entropic uncertainty relations @xcite .    in this work , like as @xcite",
    ", we have concentrated on a single system .",
    "we give our effort in finding the amount of entanglement created between the system and the apparatus by application of a single premeasurement interaction .",
    "the system may be initially prepared in any state , either pure or mixed .",
    "we try to find whether for any measurement performed on the system , prepared in an arbitrary state , there produces entanglement ? and if the entanglement is produced , how much is the amount ? for the simplest case i.e. a two - label quantum system ( in other word _",
    "qubit _ system ) , we show that the amount of entanglement , measured in terms of negativity @xcite , is quantified by two factors : ( i ) the mixedness of the initially prepared state of the system @xcite , ( ii ) the wigner - yanase skew information between the system state and the measurement direction @xcite . we observe the following two extreme cases : ( a )",
    "if the system is initially prepared in completely mixed density matrix , then no entanglement is created between the system and the measurement apparatus , whatever the measurement is performed ; ( b ) on the other hand , if the system is in a eigenstate of some observable ( say @xmath0 ) then maximal entanglement is created if the measurement interaction for the complementary observables ( in this case any operator lying in @xmath1 plane ) is switched on .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section-([sec2 ] ) we briefly describe a measurement setup .",
    "section-([sec3 ] ) contains a brief overview on wigner - yanase skew information and discussion about the mixedness of a quantum state .",
    "we present our result in section-([sec4 ] ) .",
    "consider a quantum system @xmath2 on which some measurement will be performed . before this measurement",
    "the system is either in some pure state @xmath3 or more generally in some mixed state @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a ray vector of the hilbert space @xmath6 associated with the system and @xmath7 is the collection of density matrix ( positive and trace one ) acting on @xmath6 .",
    "suppose a projective measurement ( pvm ) @xmath8 , with @xmath9 outcomes , has to be performed , where each of the @xmath10 are projectors ( not necessarily rank one ) sum up to identity operator acting on @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath11 . to measure any such observable @xmath12 on @xmath2 one need another system called measurement device or apparatus system denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "the pointer of the apparatus must indicates different positions ( or different digits ) depending on the different values @xmath9 of the measurement @xmath12 .",
    "more precisely , the pointer states corresponding to different outcomes must be orthogonal so that they can be perfectly distinguished .",
    "the first step of a measurement process is called ` premeasurement ' where a correlation is established between the system and the measurement apparatus ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . consider an orthonormal basis @xmath14 for the apparatus system @xmath13 .",
    "the interaction is made in such a way that the operator system jumps to the state @xmath15 whenever the projector @xmath10 clicks .",
    "the required interaction can be written as @xmath16 in eq.([premea1 ] ) @xmath17 denote the initial state of the measurement apparatus and we have consider the apparatus in a pure state . in ref.@xcite the author consider the scenario where the initial state of the apparatus may be a mixed state .",
    "however , initially the system may be in a mixed state @xmath18 . in that case the final state ( also called the ` premeasurement state ' @xcite ) of the composite system ( system @xmath19 apparatus ) after the premeasurement is given by @xmath20      we have already discussed that the dynamics of any quantum measurement procedure is describe by an interaction process between the system and the measurement procedure .",
    "if some pvm @xmath8 is to be performed on the system then in the dynamical process of the measurement ( i.e. the premeasurement process ) the value of @xmath12 on the system state at some initial time transfer to an observable of the apparatus after the interaction . thus the system and the apparatus become correlated . denoting @xmath21 and @xmath22 as the system and measurement apparatus hamiltonian respectively , the total hamiltonian can be expressed as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "denote at some initial time ( @xmath25 ) the composite state of the system and apparatus as @xmath26 .",
    "after the interaction , at time @xmath27 the evolved state is @xmath28 where , @xmath29 . from the above expression it is clear that the composite system will preserve the product form in absence of @xmath24",
    "starting with arbitrary initial state of the system , in this work , our aim is to calculate the amount of entanglement between the system and the measurement apparatus in the premeasurement state for arbitrary measurement performed on the system . for two - label system",
    "we obtain an analytic expression . but before presenting our we discuss some prerequisites in the following section .",
    "_ * skew information * _ : quantum mechanics fundamentally differs , in many ways , from classical physics",
    ". one of the intrinsic feature of qm is heisenberg s uncertainty principle , which says that outcomes of two noncommuting observables can not be jointly predicted with arbitrary precision @xcite .",
    "remarkably , even a single quantum observable may display an intrinsic uncertainty as a result of the probabilistic character of quantum mechanics .",
    "there are several ways to quantify the uncertainty on single measurement .",
    "one such quantity is _ skew information _ , introduced by wigner and yanase in long back 1963 @xcite .",
    "it finds application in the study of uncertainty @xcite , information geometry @xcite and non classical correlations @xcite .",

    "it has been also pointed out that skew information is the quantum version of well known fisher information and plays important role in quantum estimation @xcite .    _",
    "* mixedness of density matrix * _ : not all quantum states are pure .",

    "has @xmath42 but @xmath43 . on the other hand pure states",
    "satisfy @xmath44 and they are isomorphic to the ray vectors of the associated hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "the amount of mixedness of a density matrix @xmath30 is quantified as @xcite : @xmath45 from the above expression it is clear that mixedness is zero for pure states and maximum for the state @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the identity operator acting on d - dimensional hilbert space @xmath48 .",
    "the state @xmath46 is called completely mixed state .",
    "consider any two - label quantum system generally called qubit .",

    "for the two - label system this convex set is isomorphic to bloch sphere with pure states lying on the surface of the sphere and mixed states inside .",
    "measurements on a qubit is represented by @xmath56 with eigenstates @xmath57 and @xmath58 .     of the system .",

    "the vector and @xmath74 and @xmath75 denote the polar and azimuthal angle respectively ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) , the eq.([skew ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath76 from the above expression it can be conclude that for a two - label quantum system the skew information of a measurement on some state ( either pure or mixed ) depends on the angle between the measurement direction and the direction of the bloch vector corresponding the quantum state and also depends on the mixedness of the density matrix ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .    )",
    ".,width=302,height=188 ]    let us now quantify the mixedness of the qubit state @xmath77 .",

    "there are many different measures to calculate the amount of entanglement in a state @xcite . for our purpose",
    "we take one such well known measure called negativity @xcite which is given by : @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes partial transpose with respect to the subsystem @xmath84 , @xmath85 s denote the eigenvalues of @xmath86 and @xmath87 be the trace - norm of an operator . for the state in eq.([state ] ) calculating negativity in a straightforward manner and using the expressions from eq.([skew ] ) and eq.([mixed2 ] ) we obtain : @xmath88 from this expression it is clear that the amount of entanglement in the premeasurement state is zero for any measurement whenever the system is initially prepared in completely mixed state ( i.e @xmath89 ) . on the other hand if the system is initially prepared in some pure state lying in the @xmath1 plane ( i.e. @xmath90 ) and the interaction for @xmath0 measurement is switched on , then the premeasurement state turns out to a maximally entangled state and hence we achieved maximum entanglement .",
    "implementation of quantum measurement procedure , in laboratory , is a challenging task @xcite . realizing the c - not operation deserve more attention as it has been shown that any two qubit operation can be decomposed into controlled - not gates between two qubits and rotations on a single qubit @xcite . till date different physical systems , like cold trapped ions @xcite , cavity qed @xcite , superconducting quantum bits @xcite ,",
    "have been considered for practical implementation of c - not operation . in this work",
    "we have quantified the amount of entanglement generated between the a two label quantum system ( qubit ) and the measurement apparatus when c - not interaction has been switched on .    instead of a qubit if we consider a bipartite state shared between two parties and partial von - neumann measurement is performed on a single qubit",
    ", then also it can be shown that non - zero skew information ensures entanglement generation across the bipartition c vs ab , where c is the ancillary measurement probe .",
    "girolami et.al have shown that for any bipartite state @xmath91 which has non zero discord , the skew information for such state will also be non - zero @xcite .",
    "on the other hand streltsov et.al have shown that if any bipartite state has non - zero discord and partial von - neumann measurement is done on a subsystem then entanglement will be generated across c vs ab cut with c being the ancillary measurement probe @xcite . from these two results",
    "it can be said that non zero skew information ensures entanglement generation between measurement ancillary and the bipartite quantum system .",
    "on the other hand , in quantum thermodynamics , work extraction problem has got a lot of attention in the recent days and it has been shown @xcite that optimal work can be extracted from correlations present between @xmath92 subsystems of a multipartite quantum system .",
    "the authors have shown that for low @xmath92 and locally thermal subsystems , application of appropriate unitary generates a final entangled state from which maximal work can be extracted .",
    "so in work extraction problem our analysis can provide better insight as how to create a final state having maximum amount of entanglement when number of subsystem is low .",
