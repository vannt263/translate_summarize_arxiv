    "the mechanisms of motor protein motility have been a major research topic in biophysics and biomedical research for several decades  @xcite .",
    "pioneering work by huxley and his co - workers  @xcite established a mathematical model for muscle fiber contractions based on a so - called powerstroke  @xcite involving the conformational change induced by atp hydrolysis in the cross - bridges formed between the myosin and actin filaments .",
    "this conformational change in the neck region of myosin has been confirmed by various experiments  .",
    "based on huxley s model , it has been believed that this conformational change induces a swinging motion of the myosin ( lever arm hypothesis )  @xcite , rotational motion about the neck which is in turn converted into linear translational motion .",
    "this model suggests that a motor protein utilizing a powerstroke would behave like a stepping motor with a fixed step length per atp consumption .",
    "in addition , the step length is expected to be proportional to the neck length of the proteins .",
    "recent single molecule experiments testing a variety of protein mutants with different neck lengths support the lever arm mechanism of protein motility  .",
    "other recent experiments have emphasized both the length of the motor protein neck as well as the magnitude of the angle through which it swings during a powerstroke in an attempt to explain the unusually long step length of myosin i d  @xcite .",
    "however , some similar experiments showing unexpected step sizes for a given neck length appear to be inconsistent with the lever arm model  . in these experiments",
    ", proteins must somehow move over several steps during a single chemical cycle in order to produce the observed step size . some experiments",
    "showed that the speed of the motor protein is independent of the neck length in contradiction with other experiments  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the step length of certain motor proteins seems too long compared with their neck length  @xcite and some diffusive steps appeared to be necessary  @xcite .",
    "the filaments along which motor proteins move are polymers made up of polar units with a `` plus '' and a `` minus '' end .",
    "most myosin - based motor proteins move preferentially towards the plus end of the actin filament track .",
    "myosin vi moves in the opposite direction  @xcite .",
    "in addition , other motor proteins such as myosin ixb recently have been observed to move in the opposite direction under certain conditions  @xcite .",
    "these anomalous motor proteins are structurally very similar to the their plus - ended counterparts . it has been observed that when the lever arm is engineered in a certain way , the motor moved in the opposite direction  @xcite . in the case of myosin vi , it has been speculated that the naturally occurring protein moves preferentially towards the minus end of the filament through a similar mechanism  @xcite .",
    "however , the actual mechanism determining the directionality still remains unknown .",
    "the majority of motor proteins are comprised of two motor domains that work in conjunction with each other to produce directed motion .",
    "the two heads are particularly crucial to the models put forth to describe processive motors such as myosin v , which move through many atp hydrolysis cycles before detaching from its filament  @xcite .",
    "most of the prevailing models on processive motor movement require the two motor domains to work in sequence , alternating attachment states allowing the motor to move forward without completely releasing from the filament  @xcite .",
    "however , some motor proteins such as myosin ixb have only a single motor domain and yet is still a processive motor  @xcite .",
    "in addition , numerous other experiments have been performed on single headed molecular motors , both naturally occurring and derived single - headed mutants .",
    "they show a continued ability to move and produce a force against an external load despite the obvious structural deficiencies with regards to the models based on two - head mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "apart from these recent experimental findings , new models for motor proteins based on the idea of brownian motors have been intensively investigated during the last decade  @xcite .",
    "when brownian particles are in a periodic but spatially asymmetric potential and away from thermal equilibrium , they can generate mechanical work by rectifying thermal fluctuation  @xcite .",
    "since motor proteins move along an asymmetric filament and atp hydrolysis creates nonequilibrium conditions , it has been proposed that motor proteins could be described by a brownian motor model  @xcite . a brownian motor based on the flashing ratchet model moves as a step motor in consistent with experiments .",
    "however , brownian motors also provide for the possibility of moving more than one step per chemical cycle in contrast to the powerstroke model .",
    "furthermore , the step length of the brownian motor is independent on the neck length .",
    "these features possibly account for some of the experimental data which the powerstroke model fails to explain  @xcite .",
    "the powerstroke model and brownian motor model has been thought of as two opposing extremes in the search for motility mechanisms of molecular motors . in the former , thermal fluctuations have no role at all . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter is incapable of producing motion without thermal fluctuations . as a result",
    ", it was commonly believed that only one of them is the correct mechanism .",
    "however , it has recently been postulated that both mechanisms may be involved in the actual motor proteins  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to develop a single mathematical model that includes both powerstroke and brownian motor mechanisms .",
    "since the coupling between the rotational and linear translational degrees of freedom is essential to the powerstroke mechanism , our first step is to develop a model which couples rotational motion to linear motion ( section  [ sec : model ] ) . in the first model ( section  [ sec : freerotor ] ) , we demonstrate that free thermal diffusion in the rotational degree of freedom is sufficient to induce directed linear motion via a flashing ratchet mechanism .",
    "a model based on the behavior of motor proteins that is discussed in section  [ sec : tethered ] shows directed translational motion driven by either a brownian motor or a powerstroke mechanism depending on the parameters used .",
    "a more realistic motor protein model involving three chemical states is proposed in section  [ sec : tristate ] .",
    "this motor is simultaneously capable of both powerstroke and brownian motor mechanisms during a single chemical cycle .",
    "relevance of the present models to actual biological motors is discussed in the final section .",
    "and @xmath0 . the resulting probability distribution @xmath1 is shown in the lower image . in principle , @xmath2 so @xmath1 is depicted as an ellipse .",
    "the dashed lines depict the location of the potential barriers in the bound state for a point of reference .",
    "( b ) _ bound state_. upon binding to its filament , the pivot point @xmath3 of the motor shifts towards the binding site , activating the coupling between rotation and translation .",
    "the potential contours shown in the lower image corresponding to the bound state , depict the probability of remaining in the same potential well at @xmath1 or moving to the next at @xmath4 . as can be seen here , an asymmetric potential @xmath5 is required to bias the motion of the motor.,width=325 ]",
    "while various mathematical models for molecular motors driven by rotation - translation coupling have been proposed in the past@xcite , these models are not closely related to known biological molecular motors .",
    "a more realistic model is necessary to explain the experimentally observed behaviors of biological molecular motors , such as step size distributions and velocity - force relationships . here",
    ", we try to develop a mathematically simple , yet sufficiently realistic model by taking into account experimental observations as much as possible .",
    "motor proteins undergo two major conformational changes during a chemical cycle , first when atp hydrolysis takes place and second when adp is released from the protein .",
    "the main change occurs between the head and neck of the protein such that the angle between the neck with respect to the head changes . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a simple rod of length @xmath6 as a motor particle whose degrees of freedom are defined as the position of the center of mass @xmath7 and a rotational angle @xmath0 around the center ( measured from the normal to the filament ) . since free rotation does not generate translational motion ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to couple the rotational motion with the translational degree of freedom . since the release of adp occurs when the protein is attached to the filament , a large conformational change in the neck associated with the release would produce a rotation about the point of attachment to the filament .",
    "the resulting motion about that pivot point produces translational motion of the center of the motor that is proportional to @xmath8 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the potential energy of the motor in the bound state is determined by the location of the contact point @xmath9 and the orientation of the motor @xmath0 . in general , these two degrees of freedom are weakly coupled but not in a way to produce a translational motion out of the swing motion .",
    "therefore , we assume an uncoupled form of potential energy : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents a conformational change in the neck region of the protein and @xmath12 is a binding energy between the motor and the filament . since the filament is periodic , the binding energy is also periodic as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the period of the filament . noting that @xmath15 and center - of - mass coordinate @xmath7 are related by @xmath16  @xcite , the binding energy as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath0 is given by @xmath17 this potential energy function provides the desirable form of coupling between rotational and translational degrees of freedom , allowing for the conversion of rotational motion to translational motion as shown below .",
    "although motor proteins in general have several chemical states during atp hydrolysis , we will restrict this discussion to a two - state model describing a bound and unbound state for a motor protein .",
    "when a potential is absent ( unbound state ) the motor freely diffuses in its two degrees of freedom , @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "as soon as the potential is turned on ( bound state ) , the motor drifts toward a local potential minimum . switching between these two states",
    "will produce net movement in the @xmath7 direction when the potential is asymmetric along @xmath7 . to illustrate this ratchet mechanism , consider motors confined to an equilibrium point @xmath1 of the potential well , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) . when the potential is removed , the motors diffuse over the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) . as",
    "the potential turns on again , a portion of the shaded area now belongs to the basin of next potential minimum @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) . the motors that reached this area advance to the new minimum @xmath4 .",
    "the rest of the motors move back to the original minimum @xmath1 . in the particular case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , the translational diffusion alone is too small to generate directed motion .",
    "however , the addition of the rotational diffusion brings the motors to the next basin .",
    "this two - dimensional brownian ratchet mechanism can be put into a simple mathematical expression in a slow switching limit  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the potential @xmath12 is sufficiently deep and the transitions between unbound and bound states are slow , the initial probability distribution of the motors is given by @xmath18 .",
    "when the potential is removed , the distribution spreads with diffusion constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 as @xmath21 when the potential is reinstated at @xmath22 , the probability that the motors leave the basin of the current potential wells in the forward ( + x ) and backward ( -x ) direction are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the shortest distance between the potential minimum and maximum , [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] and erfc is the complementary error function .",
    "if the motor is in the unbound state for period @xmath26 and in the bound state for @xmath27 during one on - off cycle , then the average velocity of the motor is about @xmath28 here we neglected the possibility for the motors to diffuse beyond the nearest neighbor potential wells . when the potential is symmetric ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 and thus no net directed motion occurs .    .",

    "the case @xmath31=0.0 corresponds to a purely translational ratchet .",

    "figure  [ fig : adiabatic ] shows that the velocity contains no dependence on @xmath32 for @xmath31=0.0 as expected . for nonzero values of @xmath31 ,",
    "the velocity begins to increase with the motor length @xmath32 beyond the values expected from the translational ratchet alone , showing that the rotational component of the motion introduces an additional mechanism for producing directed motion in the motor .",

    "a change in the angle @xmath0 will give the motor a longer reach , enabling it to move several potential periods over one cycle with a sufficiently long motor .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : adiabatic ] , the rotational motion contributes to the motion with increasing @xmath32 until the motor is long enough to reach the nearest neighboring potential well . beyond a certain length",

    "figure [ fig : externalforce ] shows the results of two cases : @xmath31=@xmath60 where the rotational diffusion dominates and @xmath31=@xmath62 where rotational and translational diffusion equally contribute to the motion .",

    "the rotation toward an equilibrium angle advances the motor to a minimum within the basin of the potential well .",
    "we shall call this rotation the _ forward _ stroke .",
    "the forward stroke however can not drive the motor over the potential barrier and only diffusion , rotational or translational , brings the motor to the next potential well . on the contrary , in the standard powerstroke model conformational change of the motor protein",
    "drives the motor without diffusion .",
    "the key point of the powerstroke model is the presence of the _ recovery _ stroke which the motor performs when it is unbound .",
    "molecular motors typically consist of a motor domain attached to a neck and tail region .",
    "the tail region typically binds to some sort of cellular cargo or , in the case of skeletal muscle , the tail binds together with other proteins to form a bundle that works in tandem .",
    "as opposed to our free floating motor presented in the previous section , the motor protein does not freely rotate in the unbound state and instead is driven to an equilibrium angle by the recovery stroke .    as an alternate model to our previous brownian ratchet , we consider a motor which is not entirely free to move , but is tethered by one end to some external object assumed to be much larger than itself .",
    "when the motor is unbound , it rotates about the pivot point @xmath70 toward an equilibrium angle @xmath64 ( recovery stroke ) as illustrated in in fig .",
    "[ fig : tether](a ) .",

    "[ fig : tether](b ) .",

    "[ fig : tether](b ) . upon detaching from the filament ,",
    "the recovery stroke takes the motor from @xmath65 to @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tether](a ) .",
    "if the conformational change , @xmath71 ) is large enough , the point @xmath4 is in the basin of the next potential well .",
    "when it binds to the filament , the forward stroke bring the motor to @xmath72 , generating a net translational motion from @xmath1 to @xmath72 .",
    "this process is entirely deterministic and the directed motion is generated simply by alternating forward and recovery rotations without diffusion .",
    "however , the motor is still subject to large thermal fluctuation , which may hamper the powerstroke .",
    "indeed , the thermal fluctuation brings some motors back to the basin of the original potential well as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tether ] and thus reduces the average speed . on the other hand",
    ", the thermal fluctuations also make a positive contribution to the directed motion especially when the powerstroke fails . for example",
    ", one could imagine a motor prematurely binding to the filament before the recovery stroke completes . in a deterministic model that powerstroke would fail to advance the motor to the next potential well . with the addition of the thermal diffusion ,",
    "some of the motors that would fail the powerstroke are able to reach the next potential well with help of that diffusion .",
    "furthermore , when the conformational change @xmath73 is too small to reach the next minimum , the brownian motion is still capable of producing directed motion on average .    unlike the previous model , rotational diffusion in the unbound state",
    "is accompanied by a drift due to the conformational change @xmath68 .",
    "this rotational drift determines the direction of motion .",

    "processive motor proteins like myosin v , models for the processivity involve some type of coordination between the two motor domains of the myosin .",

    "the present model provides a single mechanism allowing a motor to take advantage of both diffusion as well as a subsequent powerstroke / anchoring .",
    "given the large neck of myosin v , a significant powerstroke on the order of @xmath127 would be reasonable based on a large value for @xmath88 , followed by a brownian motor phase positioning the trailing head at its full step distance from the leading head . on the other hand , a model for myosin vi could rely heavily upon the brownian motor mechanism in order to reproduce the observed behavior .",
    "we will further explore these dimeric motor proteins based on our model in a future paper  @xcite .",
    "some monomeric motor proteins such as myosin ix are thought to involve a diffusive step in order to achieve some measure of processivity  @xcite . however , to maintain this processivity monomeric motor proteins must remain in the vicinity of a filament while in a diffusive state . both nalavadi _ et al . _",

    "the motor protein then diffuses towards its next binding site before entering another powerstroke .",
    "given the assumption of this special tether in myosin ix , the present model provides a mechanism to efficiently guide the motor to its next binding site by rectifying thermal fluctuations before entering a strongly bound state .",
