    "synchronization is a common phenomenon in physics , chemistry , biology and other fields of science and technology @xcite .",
    "nowadays , different examples and variety of synchronization in ensembles of oscillators are topics of the research interest @xcite .",
    "it has been found that systems containing even a small number of elements demonstrate a great variety of different types of dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , a complete picture of synchronization is still not constructed .",
    "one of the fundamental problems is a problem of influence of an external signal to coupled oscillators .",
    "some new aspects of this problem have been recently revealed for dissipative coupling .",
    "a corresponding phase equation which generalizes classical adler equation has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "a case when two autonomous oscillators are locked has been investigated .",
    "a complete synchronization region for two oscillators with an external force has been detected , and degenerated saddle - node bifurcation of equilibrium states responsible for the destruction of such synchronization has been described .",
    "it has been shown that three - frequency quasi - periodicity appears in the phase model through a saddle - node bifurcation of invariant curves .",
    "external force synchronization has been investigated in @xcite in situation when a locking regime in system of autonomous oscillators changes to a beating regime with incommensurable frequencies .",
    "an influence of asymmetry of coupling to synchronization picture has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "excitation of a chain of three phase oscillators with dissipative coupling has been considered in @xcite .",
    "synchronization mechanisms beyond the phase approximation have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "a possibility of both the regimes observed in the phase model and a new kind of synchronization via suppression of oscillations has been shown .",
    "these results , however , refer to the simplest case when the coupling is dissipative .",
    "there is another type of coupling , namely reactive ( or conservative ) coupling .",
    "this is a situation when the coupling is realized directly through values of the variables and not through their rates @xcite .",
    "reactive coupling occurs in many interesting problems .",
    "an actual example of such coupling is ion traps @xcite . in such traps ions",
    "are confined using variable microwave fields , which restrict a magnitude of radial oscillations of the ions and a constant electric field limiting the axial motions .",
    "laser radiation of different frequencies provides instability and dissipation into the system .",
    "reactive type of the coupling is caused by coulomb repulsion between the ions .",
    "moreover a reactive coupling arises in the array of coupled nanomechanical cavities as well as in some optical problems @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the reactive coupling is an essentially more delicate phenomenon than the dissipative coupling @xcite .",
    "so in the simplest case of two coupled oscillators , equations in the phase approximation can be obtained only if we deal with second order of smallness in the coupling parameter . for this , in contrast to the dissipative coupling , it is necessary to take into account deviation of their orbits from the unperturbed states @xcite .",
    "phase bistability is possible for the reactive coupling when synchronization between oscillators may be in - phase as well as anti - phase . at the same time",
    "a problem of forced synchronization of reactively coupled oscillators has not yet been fully investigated .",
    "we should note the work @xcite having a style of the computer experiment .",
    "this work has demonstrated a possibility of two- and three - frequency quasi - periodicity and chaos in such a system . in the more recent paper @xcite",
    ", a structure of the parameter plane `` frequency - amplitude of an external signal '' has been investigated , but the most significant and complex region of small signal amplitudes has not been considered . at the same time , a phase model has not been constructed and the authors have investigated only the case when autonomous oscillators are locked .",
    "these works describe the variety of possible effects and bifurcations in such system not well enough .",
    "therefore , we discuss in this paper the following questions :    * how to write the correct phase equations for the forced system in case of the reactive coupling between oscillators ? * what is the structure of complete synchronization region for such forced oscillators , and what bifurcation is responsible for the destruction of this region ? * what effects do occur in the presence of phase bistability in case of an external forcing ? * how are the various two - frequency and three - frequency regimes embedded in the parameter space ?",
    "an important moment is a parallel consideration of two possible situations .",
    "the first one is when autonomous oscillators are locked , and the second one is when they demonstrate oscillations in the beating regime .",
    "consider a system of two reactively coupled van der pol oscillators excited by an external harmonic signal : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the control parameter , @xmath4 is the frequency detuning between oscillators , @xmath5 is the parameter of reactive coupling , @xmath6 is the signal amplitude , and @xmath7 is the signal frequency .",
    "central frequency of the oscillators is taken as unity .",
    "we assume that control parameter , coupling value and signal frequency detuning from the unit frequency are small . in this case",
    "we can use the method of slowly varying amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we represent the dynamic variables as @xmath8 and apply standard additional conditions : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the complex amplitudes .",
    "let us substitute the relations ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) in the equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , multiply the obtained expressions by @xmath12 and average the result for eliminating rapidly oscillating terms .",
    "also we use the relation @xmath13 . after some mathematical transformations",
    "we obtain the landau - stuart equations : @xmath14 now we introduce the frequency detuning of the signal @xmath15 from the central frequency : @xmath16 . since @xmath17 , we can set @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath3 in eqs.([eq4 ] ) can be eliminated by renormalization : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . as a result",
    ", we obtain : @xmath24 let us introduce the real amplitudes @xmath25 and phases of the oscillators with respect to the external signal @xmath26 using the relations @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "then eqs.([eq5 ] ) yield : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the relative phase of the oscillators .",
    "let us now to take into account the deviation of orbits from stationary unperturbed values @xmath31 . for this",
    "we set @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the small perturbations , and rewrite first and second equations in eqs.([eq6 ] ) as : @xmath34 in these equations the amplitude perturbations are strongly damped , so there is rapid convergence to the stationary states : @xmath35    substituting these expressions in third and fourth equations in eqs.([eq6 ] ) and retaining only the first and second order terms of the coupling parameter @xmath5 gives : @xmath36 here we assume that the amplitude @xmath6 is of order @xmath37 and neglect the term @xmath38 .",
    "physical explanation is that the external signal perturbs only phases of the oscillators and practically does not perturb amplitudes .",
    "subtracting eqs.([eq9 ] ) from each other , we obtain : @xmath39    eqs.([eq10 ] ) are the desired phase equations for forced reactively coupled oscillators . in the absence of coupling @xmath40",
    "we obtain phase equation of excitation of the first oscillator [ 1 ] . on the other hand , in the absence of external signal @xmath41 eqs.([eq10 ] ) can be written as the well - known equation for the relative phase @xmath30 of two reactively coupled oscillators @xcite : @xmath42 this equation describes an ability of the beating regime at @xmath43 and mutual locking of oscillators at @xmath44 .",
    "we can see also from eq.([eq11 ] ) that two oscillators may exhibit both the in - phase ( @xmath45 ) and anti - phase ( @xmath46 ) stable synchronization .",
    "there are also two unstable synchronous regimes in the intermediate values of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "model ( [ eq10 ] ) was obtained by a number of restrictions on the parameters .",
    "however , it turns out , as we will show , quite effective in a wider area .",
    "one of the basic regimes in the forced system is a complete synchronization when an external signal is locking for both oscillators . in this case",
    "relative phases of the oscillators with respect to the external signal @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constant in time .",
    "this regime corresponds to a stable equilibrium state of the system ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "let us find the region of complete synchronization on the parameter plane and discuss the mechanisms of its destruction .",
    "in the case of dissipative coupling , one stable node , one unstable node and two saddles coexist in the phase model @xcite .",
    "destruction of the complete synchronization is caused by the specific variant of saddle - node bifurcation when all the four equilibrium states merge in pairs simultaneously and disappear , and stable and unstable invariant curves occur from their manifolds @xcite . in the case of reactive coupling ,",
    "the mechanisms of synchronization and its destruction are changing and become more complicated .    to find the equilibrium states , we set @xmath50 in eqs.([eq10 ] ) : @xmath51 here @xmath52 .",
    "the perturbed matrix of the system ( [ eq10 ] ) is @xmath53 the condition of saddle - node bifurcation is zero jacobian of this matrix , i.e. @xmath54 =   0 $ ] .",
    "the obtained equation can be split into two equations : @xmath55 the first one leads to the relation @xmath56 at @xmath57 it has a solution only if we use an upper sign .",
    "subtracting one equation from another in eqs.([eq12 ] ) gives the following conditions for the saddle - node bifurcation : @xmath58    conditions ( [ eq16 ] ) define the locking band bounded by two vertical lines on the ( @xmath15 , @xmath59 ) parameter plane , so that @xmath60 ( see fig.1a ) .",
    "width of the locking band is determined by the coupling parameter .",
    "it is easy to show that at small coupling values it has a width approximately equal to @xmath5 .    ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) for @xmath61 ; a ) beating regime of autonomous oscillators , @xmath62 ; b ) locking regime of autonomous oscillators , @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 are the eigenfrequencies of the in - phase and out - phase modes .",
    "unsigned arrows indicate locking frequencies in the unstable regimes.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    now consider the second condition @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath67 and eqs.([eq12 ] ) , ( [ eq13 ] ) give @xmath68    the lines ( [ eq17 ] ) have a different configuration depending on whether the autonomous oscillators are in beating ( @xmath69 ) or in locking ( @xmath70 ) regimes . both of these cases are shown in fig.1 on the left and right side , respectively . here and below , we need to select the normalized values of the coupling parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we use the value @xmath61 .",
    "the smallness of the parameter @xmath37 ( in this case @xmath71 ) is a condition of the effectiveness of the phase model . at the same time",
    ", the choice of @xmath61 will further demonstrate certain differences of the original system from the phase model .    in the case of beating regime @xmath69 the condition",
    "@xmath72 is always satisfied .",
    "therefore , the line ( [ eq17 ] ) does not touch frequency axis and the complete synchronization region has an amplitude threshold in the beating regime of autonomous oscillators",
    ". this line forms a closed curve in the form of the `` eight '' number , fig.1a .",
    "it is easy to show that the vertical lines ( [ eq16 ] ) touch this curve .    in the case of locking regime of autonomous oscillators the configuration of lines",
    "becomes more complicated , fig.1b .",
    "now they have four characteristic tips at @xmath73 marked by arrows in fig.1b .",
    "if the signal amplitude tends to zero @xmath74 , eqs.([eq17 ] ) give the conditions for locking frequencies of two autonomous reactively coupled oscillators .",
    "the values marked in fig.1b by arrows correspond to the eigenfrequencies of these modes . @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath65 indicate the frequencies of stable in - phase and out - phase regimes , and similar points for unstable regimes are marked by unsigned arrows .",
    "thus , the in - phase and out - phase mode are locked at different frequencies .",
    "however , it turns out that there are two different types of locking of both oscillators by an external signal in a system with reactive coupling . the first one is defined by a stable equilibrium of the system ( [ eq10 ] ) and has been discussed above .",
    "the corresponding phase portrait is presented in fig.2 , fragment 1 .",
    "the second type of locking corresponds to a stable limit cycle of the system ( [ eq10 ] ) shown in fig.2 , fragment 6 . in this locking regime ,",
    "the phases of oscillators are not constant and oscillate near some equilibrium value",
    ". therefore , even in the phase approximation , a new line defined by the period of phase oscillations appears in the spectrum of oscillators .    from this",
    "it follows that the andronov - hopf bifurcation ( the stable limit cycle birth bifurcation ) is possible in the phase system with the reactive coupling .",
    "therefore , we consider a more complete bifurcation picture of the analyzed system shown in fig.3 and revealed numerically .",
    "this figure indicates also two cases : beating and locking regimes of autonomous oscillators . for the beating regime ( fig.3a )",
    ", there are two branches of saddle - node bifurcation lines @xmath75 revealed in the analytical study .",
    "they touch each other at degenerate cusp points @xmath76 .",
    "the saddle - node bifurcation lines contain the segments @xmath77 where merging of stable equilibrium and saddle occurs ( solid line ) and the segments @xmath78 where merging of unstable equilibrium and saddle takes place ( dashed line ) .",
