    "frame dragging in general relativity is usually presented by considering the effect that a dragging source , typically a rotating shell @xcite or a rotating black hole @xcite , has on test objects . in this paper",

    "a hint , as well as a further motivation , to answer this question comes from recent studies of the double kerr solution in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "these studies focused on two special and treatable cases of the general double kerr @xcite , dubbed counter - rotating and co - rotating solutions .",

    "the analysis in @xcite revealed that , in both the counter - rotating and the co - rotating case , the angular velocity of the horizon , @xmath6 , for each black hole , decreases when the two black holes are approached , keeping fixed the mass and the angular momentum of the black holes , computed as komar integrals - fig .",

    "the dashed line corresponds to the infinite distance limit ( i.e the usual kerr solution ) .",
    "the black ( grey ) lines correspond to the co - rotating ( counter - rotating ) double kerr system for different values of the physical distance @xmath5 .",

    "[ mi ] the quantity @xmath9 is naturally interpreted as the moment of inertia of each black hole in this system .",
    "even though black holes are not rigid objects , their angular velocity is expected to be constant on each connected component of the event horizon , in a stationary configuration .",
    "[ doublekerr ] shows that such moment of inertia is positive .",
    "moreover it shows that the moment of inertia increases as the distance @xmath5 decreases , for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath10 , naturally leading to a smaller angular velocity .",
    "our goal is to provide evidence for a correlation between effect ii ) and the behaviour of the moment of inertia . with this goal in mind let us consider the following type of systems .",

    "the first black hole has a fixed mass @xmath11 and a fixed non - vanishing intrinsic angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "the second black hole has mass @xmath13 , which we shall vary . to simplify we take the second black hole to have no intrinsic angular momentum @xmath14 . in this way",
    ", the second black hole will not exert effect i ) upon the first black hole , at least to first order .",
    "the variation of the angular velocity of the former black hole @xmath15 with the mass of the latter , ( ) _ m_1,j_1  , [ introeq ] gives a well defined notion to decide if there is a slow down effect associated to the dragging of a heavy object and therefore a measure of effect ii ) .",
    "a negative value for shows that the backreaction of dragging black hole two is to slow down black hole one .    in principle",
    "the analysis of could be done in the double kerr system . however , in order to be in equilibrium , the solution has a strut in between the two black holes , corresponding to a conical singularity .",
    "this introduces extra physical parameters and makes the system less  clean \" than desirable .",
    "fortunately , a regular system with the exact properties described in the previous paragraphs exists , albeit in five rather than four spacetime dimensions .",
    "it is the black saturn solution of the five dimensional vacuum einstein equations @xcite .",
    "let us take the first black hole to be the black ring and the second to be the central black hole ( having a topologically spherical horizon ) . then expresses how the angular velocity of the black ring varies , for fixed ring mass and intrinsic angular momentum , when the mass of the central black hole , with no intrinsic spin , varies .",
    "in particular , if the central black hole mass is small as compared to the adm mass of the system , tells us how the angular velocity of an isolated black ring varies if it has to drag a small central black hole along .",
    "the first result we shall present here is that the dynamics of effect ii ) can actually be richer than expected from the double kerr example . in the black saturn",

    "in spite of the different sign of the response function in the fat and thin phases , which we have correlated in section [ correlation ] with the sign of the moment of inertia , we shall now argue that the dragging effects measured by an observer at infinity _ always _ decrease when the central black hole mass increases , for fixed ring mass and angular momentum .",
    "we consider the following thought experiment to measure the magnitude of frame dragging effects far from a black hole .",
    "we suppose that the spacetime admits an asymptotically timelike killing vector @xmath64 and a @xmath65 action associated with a killing vector @xmath66 .",

    "an observer at infinity watches the satellites and measures the period @xmath72 of each orbit , relative to the observer s clock .",
    "we shall see that the difference in the periods , @xmath73 is _ independent _ of the radius at which the satellites orbit , when the central body is a kerr or a ( single spinning ) myers - perry black hole , or a ( single spinning ) black ring ; its value depends only on the adm mass , angular momentum and spacetime dimension .    in order to simplify matters , we introduce the following @xmath74 we further assume that the radial coordinate @xmath75 is chosen so that @xmath76 , which simplifies the calculations although our results will be independent of this choice",

    "the positive root corresponds to the inverse angular velocity of the satellite moving in a positive sense around the central object as for a physical satellite , @xmath87 , thus if @xmath88 we must have @xmath89 .",
    "similarly the negative root is the inverse angular velocity of the satellite moving in a negative sense around the central object .",
    "let @xmath90 be the positive and negative roots respectively .",
    "the first satellite takes a time @xmath91 to complete an orbit , while the other takes a time @xmath92 ( the sign difference comes from the fact that it moves in the opposite sense ) .",
    "the difference then is @xmath93 this is clearly a geometric quantity , so is independent of the coordinates and we indeed see that changing the @xmath75 coordinate does not alter the right hand side of our equation .",
    "thus this continues to be true , even when we do not assume @xmath94 .",
    "we shall provide some examples in the next subsection ; but before let us note that indeed circular timelike geodesics exist , at least near infinity .",
    "there are two conditions in order that timelike circular orbits exist .",
    "the condition that the roots we found above are real is @xmath95 this is required so that the curve @xmath71 is in fact a geodesic . for myers - perry , we find that this is always satisfied .",
    "we further wish the geodesics be both timelike .",
    "this corresponds to the requirement that @xmath96 for _ both _ the geodesics found . in the case of myers - perry , we require that @xmath97 which corresponds to @xmath98 being outside the larger of the two photon orbits ( the spin of the black hole splits the co - rotating and counter - rotating photon orbits ) . note that there will be stable and unstable circular orbits , depending on the value of @xmath98 .",

    "this appears somewhat paradoxical at first glance , but observe that we are comparing orbits with different angular momentum .",
    "actually the counter - rotating orbit must have , for the same energy @xmath104 and radius @xmath98 , larger angular momentum ( in modulus ) , @xmath105 , than that of the co - rotating one , @xmath106 , which makes the result natural .",

    "using equation ( [ drag ] ) , and letting @xmath129 , we see that the time difference @xmath101 , which is then a measure of frame dragging at infinity , is given , for a general stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime admitting a @xmath65 symmetry , in terms of the adm mass and angular momentum by @xmath130 we interpret this quantity as giving us a rough idea of the degree to which the central objects are dragging the spacetime near infinity . applying to the black saturn system we discussed , for which @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , we see that , in our thought experiment , increasing the mass of the central black hole , for fixed ring mass and angular momentum , always _",
    "decreases _ the amount of frame dragging at infinity , in both the fat and the thin phases .",
    "in the double kerr system , the angular velocity of the black holes decreases , as the physical distance decreases , even when the two black holes are co - rotating . an analogous situation can be observed in the black saturn system considering @xmath2 . to allow comparison with an isolated ( fat ) black ring , we take the reduced spin for the ring to be @xmath133 . from fig .",
    "[ wvsm ] we see that this constrains the relative mass of the system to be smaller than @xmath134 .",
    "we take @xmath135 .",
    "since the intrinsic angular momentum of a single spinning myers - perry black hole in @xmath136 is bounded by the mass , there will be an upper bound for the reduced spin of the black hole .",
    "the analysis of the dimensionless angular velocities of the two black objects is displayed in fig .",
    "[ jnotzero ] .     and @xmath137 , and thin , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , phases , in terms of the reduced angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "the angular momentum of the black hole is turned on with either the same sign ( co - rotating case , @xmath140 ) or opposite sign ( counter - rotating case , @xmath141 ) as the black ring angular momentum .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the reduced angular velocity of an isolated fat ( top line ) and thin ( bottom line ) black ring with with @xmath142.,width=336 ]    ( 0,0)(0,0 )    various features can be observed from fig .",
    "[ jnotzero ] :    * fat phase : turning on @xmath140 , the angular velocity of both black objects increases . for the black ring",
    "this is due to effect i ) . for the black hole",
    "this is the statement that it has positive moment of inertia .",
    "notice , however , that the angular velocity of the black ring always remains smaller than that of an isolated ring with the same conserved charges .",
    "this is analogous to the behaviour observed in the double kerr system for the co - rotating case , as advertised .",
    "such a result shows that for rings in the fat phase , as for the cases discussed of the double kerr system , effect ii ) dominants over effect i ) , since in the co - rotating case the former ( latter ) effect is expected to produce a speed up ( slow down ) of the angular velocity of the ring horizon .",
    "analogously , turning on @xmath141 , the angular velocity of both black objects decreases .",
    "* thin phase : turning on @xmath143 , for either sign , the angular velocity of the black ring has the opposite behaviour to that observed in the fat phase .",
    "the angular velocity of the black hole always increases when @xmath140 ; for @xmath141 , it initially decreases , as expected , but then starts increasing for @xmath144 .",
    "results in the thin phase are harder to interpret .",
    "we have verified that the proper distance along the equatorial plane between the two black objects increases , as @xmath143 increases .",
    "this accommodates , geometrically , the fact that @xmath138 decreases as @xmath143 increases .",
    "thus , for the smallest possible values of @xmath143 , the two objects will be close enough for the ring to exerts a strong rotational dragging ( effect i ) ) on the black hole , explaining the inversion observed in the behaviour of @xmath145 for @xmath141 .",
    "recent studies of the double kerr system @xcite have suggested a number of physical effects related to rotational dragging in a system with multiple black holes , namely :    @xmath146 : :    dragging a heavy object ( such as a black hole ) backreacts on the    dragging source ( another black hole ) by decreasing its angular    velocity , as compared to the angular velocity of the same ( in terms of    conserved quantities ) , but isolated , source . @xmath147 : :    the decrease in the angular velocity allows , for fixed mass , a higher    angular momentum than if the black hole were isolated .",
    "thus , extremal    black holes have @xmath22 in this system .",
    "the aim of this paper was to confirm and understand these effects in a different multi - black hole solution with a clear physical advantage : the balanced black saturn is a regular ( on and outside an event horizon ) solution of the vacuum einstein s equations and consequently has no further parameters besides the conserved charges of each black object .",
    "thus , the confirmation of the effects in this system establishes that they are not an artefact of the strut ( conical singularity ) present in the double kerr system .",
    "let us summarise what has been learned about the effects just mentioned :    @xmath148 : :    studying a black saturn with a zero angular momentum central black    hole , shows that the backreaction on the black ring of dragging the    central black hole may decrease or increase the angular velocity of    the ring . for small black hole mass the two phases occur ,    respectively , for fat or thin rings . in general , we have dubbed the    two black saturn phases as fat or thin phases .",
    "we have correlated these phases    with the sign of another response function which is interpreted as an    inverse moment of inertia . in the fat ( thin )",
    "phase , the moment of    inertia is positive ( negative ) . in the double kerr system",
    "the    analogous moment of inertia is positive , and therefore the system    should be compared with the fat phase .",
    "thus the black saturn results    confirms effect @xmath146 above , but simultaneously show that    there are gravitational system with exactly the opposite behaviour . @xmath149",
    ": :    fat black rings have an upper bound for the angular momentum for fixed    mass . as for the black holes in the double kerr system , the decrease    in the angular velocity in the fat phase of the black saturn system    allows , for fixed ring mass , a higher angular momentum than if the    black ring were isolated .",
    "thus , in the fat phase , black rings may have    @xmath1 in this system .    studying a black saturn having a central black hole _ with",
    "_ intrinsic angular momentum allowed a comparison between effect i ) and ii ) on the black ring .",
    "for the fat phase , the result supports the interpretation that effect ii ) described in the introduction ( the backreaction of dragging the central black hole ) is dominant over effect i ) ( the dragging exerted by the black hole ) .",
    "again this finds a close parallelism in the double kerr system : the maximum angular velocity for each black hole in this system is smaller than the maximum angular velocity of the same black hole in an isolated system , even in the co - rotating case .    in spite of the counter intuitive behaviour of thin rings , that increase their angular velocity when dragging a heavier black hole , we pointed out that a physical measure of frame dragging given by the ` gravitomagnetic clock effect ' establishes that frame dragging , as measured by an observer at infinity , always decreases in the black saturn system when the central black hole mass is increased for fixed ring mass and angular momentum . in a nut shell , ` dragging always costs ' .",
    "finally , the interaction effects between black holes discussed in this paper , could be studied in other exact solutions with multiple black holes , namely the di - ring solution @xcite .",
