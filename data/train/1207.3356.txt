    "however , for upcoming polarization sensitive experiments with lower levels of noise , the @xmath83 estimator will become almost comparable to the @xmath0-mode power spectrum for causal fields , and outperform it when probing scale - invariant fr fields .    in fig .",

    "the relative strengths of the three estimators , demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , can be understood as follows .",
    "generally , the @xmath83 and @xmath82 estimators have a larger number of independent modes contributing to the signal than the @xmath0-mode spectrum .",
    "thus , in principle , it is not surprising if they result in a higher signal to noise .",
    "however , whether that is the case depends on the experimental noise level , and the distribution of power in the given combination of cmb fields and in the magnetic field .",
    "for a scale - invariant pmf spectrum , the @xmath0-mode is essentially a copy of the @xmath13-mode , with most of the @xmath0-mode power being on scales where the @xmath13-modes are also most prominent .",

    "namely , @xmath148 peaks at @xmath149 while @xmath13 peaks at @xmath150 . in other words ,",
    "the intrinsic correlation between @xmath148 and @xmath13 is already suboptimal , translating into a lesser correlation between @xmath148 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for experiments with a sufficiently low noise @xmath111 , such as e1 , e2 and e3 considered in this paper , the @xmath83 estimator performs better than @xmath82 for scale - invariant fields .",
    "this would not necessarily remain true if polarization measurements had a significantly higher experimental noise .    for the blue causal spectra ,",
    "the fr power is concentrated on very small scales , far away from the scales at which any of the unrotated cmb fields have significant power .",
    "this means that the @xmath0-modes in the observable range are obtained either by the rotation of @xmath13-modes far away from their peak power scale , or by a rotation of peak @xmath13-mode by a negligible angle .",
    "this means that @xmath13 and @xmath0 fields peak at very different scales , with their correlation being close to zero over the observable scales . in this case",
    ", we see that the @xmath0-mode spectrum , i.e. the @xmath106 correlation , has the highest signal to noise .    when interpreting the forecasted bounds on the magnetic field energy fraction or the effective magnetic field strength in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , several points must be kept in mind :    1 .   the constraints are on @xmath53 , obtained after setting @xmath52 , with the dissipation scale determined from eq .",
    "( [ kiomegab ] ) . for scale - invariant fields",
    "there is no difference between @xmath53 and @xmath40 , since the factor relating them in eq .",
    "( [ eq : conversion ] ) goes to unity when @xmath151 . also , for scale - invariant fields , the effective field @xmath47 defined via eq .",
    "( [ beff - omega ] ) is the same as the commonly used @xmath152 , which is the field smoothed on a given scale @xmath153 .",
    "thus , our forecasts of the minimum detectable @xmath47 for scale - invariant fields can be directly compared to most other bounds in the literature .",
    "2 .   for causal fields ,",
    "the bound on @xmath53 will generally overestimate the magnetic energy fraction , since it assumes that the spectrum will keep rising at the same steep rate ( @xmath131 ) all the way to the dissipation scale , which is much smaller than the smallest scale directly probed by cmb experiments .",
    "simulations @xcite suggest that the spectrum must become less steep , with @xmath154 in the range @xmath155 , implying a smaller net magnetic energy fraction @xmath40 .",
    "since the value of @xmath42 is not well - known at this point , we chose to quote our bounds in terms of @xmath53 , while keeping in mind that bounds on @xmath40 for causal fields will generally be tighter .",
    "3 .   strictly speaking ,",
    "our bounds are on the fraction in magnetic fields at the time when the initial conditions for the transfer functions ( [ eq : transfer ] ) were set , which is a time close to last scattering . while it is expected that the magnetic fields are effectively frozen - in between the bbn and last scattering , with a relatively slow time evolution of the dissipation scale , this is still an approximation .",
    "the bounds are based on using a single frequency band .",
    "using several bands will improve the constraints .",
    "generally , cmb is not very sensitive to magnetic fields with blue spectra because most of the anisotropies are concentrated on very small scales .",
    "this is what figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] are showing too .",
    "however , looking for the fr signatures at many frequencies can potentially improve the existing cmb bounds on causal fields by a large factor .",
    "we leave this question as a topic for future exploration .    in the case of scale - invariant fields , current bounds on the magnetic field strength from wmap",
    "are at a level of a few ng @xcite .",
    "these bounds are based on the anisotropies induced by the metric fluctuations sourced by magnetic fields , and ignore the fr effect . in refs .",
    "@xcite the wmap bound using fr was obtained at the @xmath156 level .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , planck ( e1 ) can almost match today s bounds for scale invariant ( @xmath157 ) fields using the @xmath83 estimator at only one frequency , while future probes , such as e2 and e3 , can improve the bounds by an order of magnitude !",
    "this suggests that the mode coupling estimators of fr will be a very powerful , if not the most powerful , direct probe of scale - invariant magnetic fields at the time of last scattering .",
    "a primordial magnetic field present at and just after last scattering will faraday - rotate the plane of polarization of the cmb photons .",
    "the fr will create @xmath0-mode polarization even in the absence of primordial sources , such as gravity waves .",
    "in addition to a @xmath0-mode autocorrelation , fr also couples different modes of the cmb fields , generating specific off - diagonal correlators .",
    "estimators of the polarization rotation angle , such as ( [ eqn : estimator ] ) , can utilize these non - gaussian features to reconstruct the fr map .",
    "one can construct four such estimators containing products of two cmb fields , one of which contains polarization : @xmath158 and @xmath83 .",
    "of these four , the first two receive a large contribution to their variance from the usual scalar adiabatic gaussian perturbations which makes it harder to find the fr signal . in this paper",
    ", we have considered the last two and found that the @xmath83 estimator has the highest signal - to - noise .    for causal magnetic fields , which tend to have very blue power spectra",
    ", the @xmath0-mode power spectrum has a higher signal - to - noise due to reasons explained in the previous section .",
    "however , the @xmath83 estimator performs better for scale - invariant fields .",
    "in addition , there are certain advantages in using mode - coupling based estimators , such as @xmath83 , over the traditional @xmath0-modes power spectrum .",
    "for instance , there are other sources that can generate @xmath0-modes , such as weak lensing , patchy reionization , inflationary tensor perturbations or cosmic strings , and , in fact , metric perturbations induced by the magnetic fields .",
    "hence , one has to separate the fr induced @xmath0-modes either by using the frequency dependence of fr or features in the @xmath0-mode spectrum .",
    "interestingly , while patchy reionization and lensing also generate off - diagonal correlations in cmb , their contributions are `` orthogonal '' to the features imprinted by fr  @xcite .",
    "hence , mode - coupling estimators do not suffer from contamination from other contributions .",
    "this means that a larger part of the information in the frequency dependence can be used for systematic checks and to separate from other foreground contamination .",
    "in addition , mode - coupling estimators can be used to reconstruct the map of fr .",
    "this fr map can be used to cross - correlate with other tracers of magnetic fields , including cmb maps and surveys of large scale structure .",
    "such correlations studies are useful for systematic checks and for increasing the signal - to - noise .",
    "we have found that a planck - like experiment at 90ghz can detect scale - invariant pmf of a few ng strength , which is comparable to the @xmath159ng sensitivity forecasted for planck based on information in the cmb temperature anisotropies @xcite .",
    "future cmb experiments will be able detect scale - invariant fields as weak as @xmath25 g at 90ghz .",
    "thus , fr should become a leading diagnostic of pmf when analyzing future cmb polarization data .",

    "<S> primordial magnetic fields ( pmf ) can create polarization @xmath0-modes in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) through faraday rotation ( fr ) , leading to non - trivial 2-point and 4-point correlators of the cmb temperature and polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the detectability of primordial magnetic fields using different correlators and evaluate their relative merits . </S>",
    "<S> we have fully accounted for the contamination by weak lensing , which contributes to the variance , but whose contribution to the 4-point correlations is orthogonal to that of fr . we show that a planck - like experiment can detect scale - invariant pmf of ng strength using the fr diagnostic at @xmath1ghz , while realistic future experiments at the same frequency can detect @xmath2 . utilizing multiple frequencies will improve on these prospects , making fr of cmb a powerful probe of scale - invariant pmf . </S>"
