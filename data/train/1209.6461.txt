    "heavy ion collisions are a powerful tool to study the nuclear properties at different conditions of density , temperature and isospin asymmetry .",
    "for example , in the fermi energy regime ( 10 - 100 _ a _ mev  ) , it is possible to explore from very low barionic densities ( @xmath4 ) clustered matter @xcite to densities in proximity to the saturation value ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "conversely , in the relativistic energy regime ( e / a @xmath6 100 _ a _ mev  ) it is potentially possible to access densities up to @xmath7 times the saturation value in a short timescale @xcite . for these reasons it is not surprising that heavy ion collisions , in particular with projectiles and targets with large isospin asymmetries , have been widely used to probe the density dependence of the symmetry term of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , that is a key ingredient for the dynamical model calculations of heavy ion collisions and astrophysical predictions @xcite .",
    "different experimental observables have been used to constraint the density dependence of the symmetry energy in heavy - ion collisions : isospin diffusion and equilibration @xcite , neutron to proton ratio @xcite , light charged particles transverse collective flow @xcite , ratio of fragments yields and isoscaling @xcite , heavy residues production in semi - central collisions @xcite , isospin migration in the low density `` neck '' region @xcite .",
    "these different observables from heavy ion reactions at low densities are generally consistents within uncertainties @xcite , but results can be strongly dependent from comparison with microscopic calculations simulating the nuclear dynamics .",
    "indeed a weak overlap exists so far between constraints from heavy ion collisions and the estimate of the symmetry energy from astrophysical observations on neutron stars @xcite . for these reasons it is important to add new observables , increasing accuracies of the existing ones and to improve the model simulations in order to reduce the relative large actual uncertainties .    in this contribution we present experimental data for the @xmath0ni+@xmath1sn and @xmath2ni+@xmath3sn reactions studied in direct kinematics with the chimera detector at the same beam incident energy ( 35 _ a _ mev  ) of the previously studied experiment in reverse kinematics @xcite .",
    "the ensemble of data of the two experiments collects a unique set of information on the midrapidity `` neck '' fragmentation mechanism in semi - peripheral dissipative collisions .",
    "we show that the intermediate mass fragments ( imf , 3@xmath8z@xmath820 ) midrapidity emission presents many experimental properties ( like the n / z isospin asymmetry enhancement ) that in transport models calculations are attributed to the formation , in the early stage of the reaction , of a low density region ( `` neck '' ) connecting projectile - like and target - like fragments .",
    "these properties can be linked to reaction dynamics if they are correlated with the timescale evolution of the nuclear reactions . in this contest",
    "we have compared experimental data for the reverse kinematics experiment with a stochastic mean field calculation ( smf ) in order to get a parametrization for the potential symmetry energy term of eos .",
    "the direct kinematic experiment has been performed at the catania infn - lns superconducting cyclotron where beams of @xmath0ni and @xmath2ni at 35 a.mev of 0.5 ena intensity impinged on self - supporting @xmath1sn and @xmath3sn thin targets whose thickness are respectively 187 @xmath9 and 268 @xmath9 .",
    "reaction products were detected with the 4@xmath10 detector chimera in its full configuration , constituted by 1192 si - csi(tl ) telescopes arranged in 35 rings around the beam axis .",
    "data acquisition was triggered when at least three silicon detectors were fired .",
    "this experiment was the first to use on a large number of detectors the chimera silicon pulse shape upgrade @xcite , giving the possibility to charge identify the particles that are stopped in silicon detectors . in the reverse kinematics experiment only the forward part of the detector ( 688 telescopes covering the angular range between 1@xmath11 and 30@xmath11 ) was used .",
    "details of this latter experiment setup are described elsewhere @xcite .     for the reaction @xmath0ni+ @xmath1sn .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows an example of the charge identification obtained for light fragments ( z@xmath820 ) using the pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) technique for a silicon detector .",
    "the identification threshold is around 4 a.mev for light charges ( z=6 ) .",
    "the use of psd technique was very important in this direct kinematics experiment because a part of slow imfs , produced in the mid - rapidity region , fall below the threshold for @xmath12 identification .",
    "we have selected almost complete events where the total charge is 45@xmath1380 and the parallel momentum of the colliding system is at least 60% of the total one .",
    "semipheripheral collisions were selected gating on the total charged particle multiplicity m@xmath87 .",
    "following the same methods used in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to select ternary events in the final state , we considered a subset of events where the total charge of the three biggest fragment z(1)+z(2)+z(3 ) @xmath6 45 and their momentum @xmath14 0.6@xmath15 .",

    "[ fig2 ] shows for the selected events the 2-dimensional plot of fragments parallel velocity along the beam axis as a function of their charge for the @xmath0ni+@xmath1sn reaction .",
    "it is interesting to compare this plot with the same obtained for the reverse kinematics experiment ( fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "the slow - moving and massive tlf fragments are produced around 1 @xmath16 velocity and all particles belonging to this region ( mainly stopping in the first stage silicon detectors ) are identified in mass with time - of - flight techniques .",
    "the complete angular coverage at least up to 90@xmath11 becomes essential to study events in which projectile - like and target - like fragments are simultaneously present in the same events for semi - peripheral collisions .",
    "we clearly see also the two regions respectively of plf ( ni - like ) with velocities around 7.5 cm / ns and of imfs in the intermediate velocity region between the two main partners of the reaction .",
    "in order to disentangle dynamically and statistically emitted fragments and to look for timescale of fragment formation , the three biggest fragments of each event were sorted according to the decreasing value of their parallel velocity , following the method described in @xcite .",
    "the three particles , labeled as plf , imf ( 3@xmath8z@xmath820 ) or tlf , depending upon their respective velocity were analyzed to check the correct attribution event by event ; finally the fragment - fragment relative velocities @xmath17 and @xmath18 were calculated and are reported in fig .",

    "7 ) we note now that we can populate with similar efficiency both the regions along the @xmath21=1 axis ( whose yield is dominated by sequential emission from plf ) and @xmath23=1 axis ( whose yield is mainly due to sequential emission from tlf ) ; values of @xmath21 and @xmath23 simultaneously larger than unity indicate a prompt ternary division ( dynamical origin ) .",
    "we can observe that heavier fragments ( as z=14 in the figure ) are originated mainly by the break - up or fission of the heavy partner , i.e. the target - like residue in our case and they lie along the r@xmath25=1 axis , while light fragments are concentrated along the diagonal , indicating their prevailing dynamic origin . in fig .",

    "this method permits to explore and disentangle different stages of the dynamical evolution of the system , that normally are mixed together when looking , for example in a source recognition analysis , at galilean invariant @xmath26 contour diagrams .    in order to study the alignment properties of midvelocity fragments ,",
