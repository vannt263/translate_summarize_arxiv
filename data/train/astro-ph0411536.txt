    "clusters of galaxies are the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the universe .",
    "the mass is the most important property of these systems .",
    "the cluster mass function and its evolution provide constraints on the evolution of large - scale structure and important cosmological parameters such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio of clusters provides one of the most robust determination of @xmath12 in connection with the observed light density in the universe via the oort ( 1958 ) method . for these reasons , over the last 70 years ( starting with zwicky 1933 , 1937 , and smith 1936 ) , much effort has been spent measuring the mass of clusters using a number of techniques .",
    "these include : ( i ) dynamical methods applied on the galaxy distributions derived from redshift surveys , or ( ii ) based on the distribution and temperature of the diffuse hot gas in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , observed at x - ray wavelength , ( iii ) gravitational lensing , and ( iv ) observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "all these methods are in general quite expensive in terms of the observational resources required , especially for high redshift clusters .    in the literature",
    "several comparisons have been made between the different methods for determining the mass of the clusters .",
    "these include comparisons between the x - ray and strong - lensing methods ( see , e.g. , wu 2000 ) in cores of clusters , between x - ray and weak lensing methods ( see , e.g. , smail et al .",
    "1997 ) , and between the dynamical and the x - ray methods ( see , e.g. , wu 2000 ) . in particular , girardi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and rines et al . (",

    "1993 ; adami et al . 1998",
    "; fujita & takahara 1999 ) naturally implies that other properties , such as cluster luminosities , velocity dispersions , x - ray temperatures , can be used to infer the cluster masses .",
    "it is not known whether it is the x - ray or the optical luminosity that correlates better with the cluster mass .",
    "reiprich & bhringer ( 2002 , r02 hereafter ) showed that a tight correlation exists between the x - ray total luminosity of the clusters and the mass with a scatter of 60% .",

    "( 2000 , 2002 ) analysed the relation between mass and optical luminosity in the blue band , and detetrmined the mass - to - light ratio , for a sample of 162 clusters using inhomogeneous photometric data .",
    "yee & ellingson ( 2003 ) analysed a sample of 16 x - ray luminous clusters from the _",
    "canadian network for observational cosmology _ ( cnoc ) survey .",
    "they used the cluster optical richness , rather than the optical luminosity , and showed that it is well correlated with other global properties of galaxy clusters as their velocity dispersion , their intracluster gas temperature , and their total mass .",
    "lin et al . ( 2003 ) analysed a sample of 27 clusters with near - infrared data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and available x - ray temperature .",
    "they showed that the @xmath13-band luminosity of a cluster can be used to estimate its mass with 45% accuracy .    analysing",
    "the relation between optical luminosity and cluster mass is not an easy task .",
    "the lack of optical wide field surveys in the past did not allow to measure in the proper way the optical luminosity in galaxy systems .",
    "until now the uncertainties in luminosity determination came from the corrections for the calibration of inhomogenous photometric data , background galaxy contamination and the need to extrapolate the sum of measured luminosities of galaxy members to include faint galaxies and the outer parts of the systems , beyond the region studied . the use of the _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) for the optical data allows us to overcome all the problems related to the optical luminosity estimation .",
    "in this paper we use the rass - sdss galaxy cluster sample ( popesso et al .",
    "2004 ) to study the correlations between the optical luminosity and other important properties of galaxy clusters such as their mass , line - of - sight velocity dispersion , temperature and x - ray luminosity .",
    "moreover , the rass - sdss galaxy cluster sample allows us to compare the correlations of the optical and , respectively , the x - ray luminosity with other global properties of the systems . the excellence of the second release of the sdss ( sdss - dr2 , abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) in terms of its size , depth and sky coverage , the accurate photometry in 5 different optical wavebands , and the detailed spectroscopy for more the 260,000 galaxies , give us unprecedented advantages in comparison to the previous studies .",
    "firstly , the sky coverage ( 3324 @xmath14 ) gives us the possibility of studying a large sample of clusters with completely homogeneous photometric data .",
    "secondly , the accurate estimation of the spectroscopic redshift for a large subsample of galaxies allows us to define an accurate membership for any cluster and , thus , perform a detailed dynamical analysis of the system within the same survey .",
    "thirdly , the sky coverage of the survey allows also to overcome the well known problem of the statistical subtraction of the galaxy background .",
    "we use large areas of the survey to define a mean global galaxy background and a region close to the clusters to determine the local galaxy background in order to check for systematics in the field subtraction .",
    "finally , the apparent magnitude of the sdss dr2 in all the five bands is sufficiently deep ( e.g. @xmath15 , 95% completeness ) that , at the mean redshift of our cluster sample ( @xmath16 ) , the cluster luminosity function ( lf ) is sampled down to a significant part of the faint end .",
    "moreover , the use of the _",
    "rosat all sky survey _ ( rass ) allows us to define also the x - ray properties in an homogeneous way for all the systems and perform a detailed comparison with the optical luminosity .    in this paper",
    "we show that the optical luminosity , @xmath3 , is strongly correlated with the other global properties of a galaxy cluster , allowing its use as an estimator for quantities such as the velocity dispersion , the mass , and the intra - cluster gas temperature , @xmath2 .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath3 is a better predictor of the virial mass than the x - ray luminosity , which makes @xmath3 an important defining parameter of galaxy clusters , and an extremely useful cosmological tool . throughout this paper",

    "the sdss consists of an imaging survey of @xmath21 steradians of the northern sky in the five passbands @xmath22 in the entire optical range from the atmospheric ultraviolet cutoff in the blue to the sensitivity limit of silicon in the red .",
    "the survey is carried out using a 2.5 m telescope , an imaging mosaic camera with 30 ccds , two fiber - fed spectrographs and a 0.5 m telescope for the photometric calibration .",
    "the imaging survey is taken in drift - scan mode .",
    "the imaging data are processed with a photometric pipeline ( photo , lupton et al .",
    "2001 ) specially written for the sdss data . for each cluster we defined a photometric galaxy catalog as described in section 3 of popesso et al .",
    "( 2004 , see also yasuda et al .",
    "2001 ) .    for the analysis in this paper we use only sdss model magnitudes .",
    "due to a bug of photo , found during the completion of dr1 , the model magnitudes were systematically under - estimated by about 0.2 - 0.3 magnitudes for galaxies brighter than 20th magnitude , and accordingly the measured radii were systematically too large .",
    "this problem has been fixed in the sdss dr2 , therefore the model magnitude can be considered a good estimate of the galaxy total luminosity at any magnitude and is not dependent on the seeing as the petrosian magnitudes .",
    "the spectroscopic component of the survey is carried out using two fiber - fed double spectrographs , covering the wavelength range 38009200  , over 4098 pixels .",
    "they have a resolution @xmath23 varying between 1850 and 2200 , and together they are fed by 640 fibers , each with an entrance diameter of 3 arcsec .",
    "the fibers are manually plugged into plates inserted into the focal plane ; the mapping of fibers to plates is carried out by a tiling algorithm ( blanton et al .",
    "2003 ) that optimizes observing efficiency in the presence of large - scale structure .",
    "the finite diameter of the fiber cladding prevents fibers on any given plate from being placed closer than 55 arcsec apart . for",
    "any given plate , a series of fifteen - minute exposures is carried out until the mean signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) per resolution element exceeds 4 for objects with fiber magnitudes ( i.e. , as measured through the 3 aperture of the fiber ) brighter than @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as determined by preliminary reductions done at the observing site . under good conditions ( dark , clear skies and good seeing ) , this typically requires a total of 45 minutes of exposure .    to create a homogeneous catalog of x - ray cluster properties ,",
    "we have computed the x - ray luminosity using only rass data for all clusters in the sample .",
    "the x - ray luminosity has been calculated with the growth curve analysis ( gca ) method used for the noras and reflex cluster surveys ( bhringer et al .",
    "2000 ) based on the rass3 data base ( voges et al .",
    "the gca method is optimized for the detection of the extended emission of clusters by assessing the plateau of the background subtracted cumulative count rate curve .",
    "we use as final result the total flux inside the radius @xmath1 which is corrected for the missing flux estimated via the assumption of a standard @xmath26-model for the x - ray surface brightness ( see bhringer et al .",
    "2000 for more details ) .",
    "the correction is typically only @xmath27 illustrating the high effectiveness of the gca method to sample the flux of extended sources . for a subsample of 49 galaxy clusters",
    "we have also compiled from the literature the asca temperature of the icm .",
    "the total optical luminosity of a cluster has to be computed after the subtraction of the foreground and background galaxy contamination .",
    "we consider two different approaches to the statistical subtraction of the galaxy background .",
    "we compute the local background number counts in an annulus around the cluster and a global background number counts from the mean of the magnitude number counts determined in five different sdss sky regions , each with an area of 30 @xmath28 . in our analysis",
    "we show the results obtained using the optical luminosity estimated with the second method . the optical luminosity is then computed following the prescription of popesso et al .",
    "the reader is referred to that paper for a detailed discussion about the comparison between optical luminosities calculated with different methods .",
    "to select the members of each systems and estimate the mass we use the redshifts in the sdss spectroscopic sample . the sdss spectroscopic pipeline ( spectro1d )",
    "assigns a final redshift to each object spectrum by choosing the emission or cross - correlation redshift with the highest confidence level .",
    "the emission - redshift is obtained matching the list of candidate emission lines against a list of common galaxy and quasar emission lines .",
    "the cross - correlated redshift is estimated by cross - correlating the spectrum with stellar , emission - line galaxy , and quasar template spectra .    in order to select the cluster members , we proceed in two steps . in the first step",
    "we follow the method of girardi et al .",
    "namely , we select only galaxies within a circle of radius the abell radius ( 2.15 mpc ) , and eliminate those with redshift @xmath29 km s@xmath18 , where @xmath30 is the mean cluster redshift as given in the x - ray catalogues ( see section 2 ) .",
    "we then define the weighted gaps ( see also beers et al .",
    "1990 ) in the @xmath31-distribution of the remaining galaxies , and reject galaxies separated from the main cluster body by a weighted gap @xmath32 .",
    "this allows us to define the cluster limits in velocity space .    in the second step of our procedure for membership selection , we consider all galaxies ( not only those within an abell radius ) with a velocity within the limits defined with the gapper procedure , and apply the method of katgert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) on these galaxies .",
    "the method takes into account both the velocities and the clustercentric positions of the galaxies ( we take the x - ray center as the dynamical center of the cluster ) .",
    "the method is identical to that of den hartog & katgert ( 1996 ) when the cluster sample contains at least 45 galaxies , and it is a simplified version of it for smaller samples ( for more details , see appendix a in katgert et al .",
    "2004 ) .    the virial analysis ( see , e.g. , girardi et al .",
    "1998 ) is then performed on the clusters with at least 10 member galaxies .",
    "the velocity dispersion is computed using the biweight estimator ( beers et al .",
    "the virial masses are corrected for the surface pressure term ( the & white 1986 ) by adopting a profile of navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ; nfw ) with concentration parameter @xmath33 ( this profile has been found to describe the average mass profile of rich clusters by katgert et al .",
    "correction for the surface term requires knowledge of the @xmath1 radius , for which we adopt carlberg et al.s ( 1997a ) definition ( see eq.(8 ) in that paper ) , as a first guess .",
    "after the virial mass is corrected for the surface pressure term , we refine our @xmath1 estimate using the virial mass density itself .",
    "say @xmath34 the virial mass ( corrected for the surface term ) contained in a volume of radius equal to the clustercentric distance of the most distant cluster member in the sample , i.e. the aperture radius @xmath35 .",
    "the radius @xmath1 is then given by : @xmath36^{1/2.4 } \\label{e - r200}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the critical density at redshift @xmath31 in the adopted cosmology .",
    "the exponent in eq.([e - r200 ] ) is the one that describes the average cluster mass density profile near @xmath1 , as estimated by katgert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for an ensemble of 59 rich clusters .",
    "similarly , @xmath0 is estimated by setting 500 instead of 200 in eq.([e - r200 ] ) .",
    "finally , a @xmath33 nfw profile is used to interpolate ( or , in a few cases , extrapolate ) the virial mass @xmath39 from @xmath35 to @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "our clusters span a wide range in mass ; since clusters of different masses have different concentrations ( see , e.g. dolag et al .",
    "2004 ) we should in principle compute the cluster masses , @xmath40 s , using a different concentration parameter @xmath41 for each cluster . according to dolag et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath42 .",
    "taking @xmath33 for clusters as massive as those analysed by katgert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath43 , dolag et al.s scaling implies our clusters span a range @xmath446 .",
    "using @xmath45 instead of @xmath33 makes the mass estimates 4% and 10% higher at , respectively , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , while using @xmath46 makes the mass estimates lower by the same factors . this effect being clearly much smaller than the observational uncertainties",
    ", we assume the same @xmath33 in the analysis for all clusters .",
    "even if the completeness level of the sdss spectroscopic sample is very high , in the central regions of galaxy clusters such a level is likely to drop because fibers can not be placed closer than 55 arcsec .",
    "we estimate that the spectroscopic completeness drops to @xmath47% in the central @xmath48 mpc cluster regions .",
    "this affects the observed number density profile of a cluster , and hence our estimate of the projected mean harmonic pairwise separation @xmath49 , and , as a consequence , also our virial mass estimates ( see , e.g. , beers et al . 1984 ) . using the average cluster number density profile , and the relation between the core radius of this profile and @xmath49 , as given by girardi et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1998 ) , we estimate that this effect of incompleteness translates into an average over - estimate of the virial mass of only @xmath50% .",
    "since the effect is very small , and much smaller than the observational uncertainties , we neglect this correcting factor in the following analysis .",
    "there are several indications that cluster galaxies of later morphological and/or spectral type , have wider velocity distributions than early - type cluster galaxies ( moss & dickens 1977 ; biviano et al . 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "as a consequence , we also estimate the virial masses by considering only cluster members along the red sequence in the @xmath51 vs. @xmath7 colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "when only the red - sequence cluster members are used to compute the virial masses , these masses are @xmath52% smaller than when all the cluster members are used .",
    "a similar effect has been discussed by biviano et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the galaxy clusters of the _ eso nearby abell cluster survey , _ and by carlberg et al .",
    "( 1997b ) for the galaxy clusters of the cnoc .",
    "the effect is generally interpreted as evidence for ongoing accretion of blue field galaxies onto the cluster , before complete virialization ( see , e.g. , the discussion in biviano & katgert 2003 ) . since this effect is not negligible , in the following we consider both the mass estimates obtained using only the red - sequence galaxies , and the mass estimates obtained using all the cluster members . however , for the sake of conciseness , we only plot results for the mass estimates obtained using all the cluster members .    to check the consistency of our mass estimates with those obtained from x - ray data , we retrieve the latter from r02 , for a subsample of 10 clusters with optical mass estimates .",
    "[ compare ] shows the overall agreement between the x - ray mass from r02 and the optical mass calculated in this work ( empty squares ) .",
    "the figure shows also the same comparison between optical mass and the mass obtained from the @xmath53 relation for 6 more clusters with know asca temperature but with unknown x - ray mass ( filled squares ) .",
    "it is mainly for the systems with evident substructures in the redshift distribution ( the empty and filled squares surrounded by big triangles in the figure ) that the two mass estimates are in disagreement , as expected . in the following analysis",
    "we do not consider these clusters with strong optical substructures .",
    "we omit in fig.[compare ] the comparison between the mass estimated from the @xmath54 relation ( see eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] below ) and the direct measure of the x - ray mass ( r02 ) .",
    "they are in very good agreement since the @xmath54 relation is derived from r02 data , and the scatter in the relation is very small as showed by the errors in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] and the fig.[m_t ] .",
    "we use the @xmath54 relation to estimate the mass for the subsample of 49 clusters with known asca temperature .",
    "first , we consider the @xmath54 relations provided by finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter f01 ) .",
    "f01 provided several @xmath54 relations estimated using different samples of systems : the cluster sample of r02 ( hiflugcs + 60 more clusters ) and a sample of 39 clusters with known temperature profile from asca data ( markevitch et al .",
    "we notice that the masses estimated with the @xmath54 relation of f01 obtained from clusters with known temperature profile are systematically smaller by a factor 1.5 - 2 than both the virial masses obtained from the analysis of the galaxy distribution , and also the x - ray masses of r02 .",
    "f01 s sample comprises only 9 of the 45 clusters included in r02 s sample with temperature higher than 5 kev .",
    "the masses of these 9 clusters are in good agreement with the masses estimated in r02 ( which assumes the isothermality of the icm ) but , as shown in fig .",
    "[ r02_f01 ] , the high - mass region is not well sampled .",
    "moreover , the presence of 4 systems in the low mass regime with @xmath55 ( where @xmath26 is the exponent of the @xmath26-model used to calculate the x - ray mass , see f01 or r02 for more details ) implies both a steepening of the @xmath54 relation and a decrease of its normalization .    therefore , instead of using the @xmath54 relation of f01 , we prefer to recalibrate the @xmath54 relation using the data of r02 in order to obtain both the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 relations .",
    "data are fitted with the odrpack routine ( akritas @xmath58 bershady 1996 ) and the errors are calculated using a bootstrap method . in the following analysis",
    "the mass is calculated from the temperature with the following relations : @xmath59 @xmath60 the normalization of the @xmath54 relation in eq.([eq1 ] ) is 60% higher than that of the usual @xmath54 relation of f01 estimated with the sample with known @xmath2 profiles .",
    "there is much better agreement ( within 1 @xmath61 ) with the relation of f01 estimated excluding from the sample the groups with @xmath26 lower than 0.4 .",

    "the values of slope and normalization of the @xmath5 relation lies in the range of values given in r02 . to recalibrate the @xmath5 relation",
    "we add our enlarged sample to the sample of clusters of r02 obtaining a final sample of 198 clusters ( 106 from r02 @xmath154 102 from this work @xmath155 10 common systems ) with known mass and x - ray luminosity .",

    "it is particularly interesting to compare the scatter of the @xmath159 and @xmath5 relations in order to understand which of the two observables , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , shows the best correlation with the cluster mass .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists three kinds of scatters evaluated for each correlation : the orthogonal scatter , which gives an estimate of the dispersion along the direction orthogonal to the best fit line , and the scatter in both variables .",
    "the orthogonal scatter in the @xmath159 relation has a minimum value of 20% and a maximum of 30% in all the analysed correlations .",
    "the observable @xmath3 can be used to predict the cluster mass within @xmath0 or @xmath1 with a maximum accuracy of 40% and with a minimum of 50% .",
    "the x - ray luminosity shows a less tight relation with the cluster mass for all the analysed correlations .",
    "in fact , the orthogonal scatter of the @xmath5 relations lies in the range 38 - 50% , while the mass can be predicted from the x - ray luminosity with an accuracy in the range 55 - 65% .",
    "these values are in agreement with the results of r02 and are confirmed also by the correlation obtained with the r+e sample , as indicated in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the dispersion along the @xmath4 axis is much larger ( more than 90% ) and is due to the propagation of the errors , since @xmath164 .",
    "the difference in the scatter observed in the two relations can not be explained by the measurement errors , since the average error in the @xmath3 measure is around @xmath165 and is comparable to the average measurement error in @xmath4 ( around @xmath166 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the large scatter of the @xmath5 relation is the presence of a large number of groups in our samples .",
    "in fact measuring the mass and the x - ray luminosity for low - mass systems is not an easy task .",
    "however , the low - mass systems do not increase the scatter in the @xmath159 relation , as they should if their masses were not measured correctly . moreover , the scatter of the @xmath5 relation is the same in all the mass ranges , since including or excluding the groups in our analysis does not change the amount of scatter in the correlations .",
    "a more plausible explanation for the larger scatter in the @xmath5 relation in comparison to the @xmath159 relation , is the presence of a large number of cool - core ( once named cooling flow ) clusters in the analysed sample .",
    "in fact , the presence of a cool core in a cluster could cause an increase of the observed x - ray luminosity for a given cluster mass . in principle",
    "even the mass estimated from the icm temperature could be affected by this effect .",
    "in fact , markevitch ( 1998 , hereafter m98 ) has shown that the presence of a cool core in a system can significantly affect the temperature estimation if the cool core region is not excised .",
    "however , the scatter observed in the @xmath5 relation obtained with the x sample and with the r02 sample , in which the mass is calculated using the temperature , is exactly the same observed in the @xmath5 relation obtained with the o sample , in which the mass estimation is not influenced by the presence of a cool core .",
    "thus , we do not expect that the presence of a cool core affects the mass in our correlation .",

    "panels @xmath41 and @xmath185 show the same relation given by the total x - ray luminosity of the system in the same energy band and @xmath75 .",
    "the total @xmath4 is taken from r02 and is calculated within @xmath1 with a method similar to the method used to estimate the x - ray luminosity in the rass - sdss sample .",
    "therefore , it should give a robust estimate of the total x - ray emission of the system .",
    "panel @xmath41 shows the @xmath5 relation with uncorrected x - ray luminosity , while panel @xmath185 shows the @xmath5 relation obtained using the x - ray luminosity corrected for the cool core effect .",
    "the correction is obtained by comparing the corrected and uncorrected @xmath4 retrieved in m98 .",
    "m98 removed the effect due to the presence of a cool core with the excision of the cool core region .",
    "they assumed that a 70 kpc radius contains most of the cool core emission in non - extreme cool core clusters , such as those in the sample considered here .",
    "therefore , to do the excision in a uniform manner , for all clusters , regions of 70 kpc radius centered on the main brightness peak were masked , and the resulting fluxes and luminosities were multiplied by 1.06 to account for the flux inside the masked region , assuming an average @xmath26 model for the cluster x - ray brightness . therefore , subtracting the corrected x - ray luminosity from the uncorrected one gives the amount of cool - core correction applied by m98 .",
    "we use the same amount to correct the total x - ray luminosities given by r02 .",
    "as shown in table [ table3 ] , applying the correction for cool - core effect does not change the scatter of the relation .",
    "in fact , in the relation obtained using the total x - ray luminosity , the scatter along the @xmath75 axis is 0.13 dex before the correction and 0.12 dex after that .",
    "this means that the cool core correction can reduce the scatter by only 3% . as a matter of fact , for most of the clusters in the m98 sample",
    "the correction is of the same order .",
    "moreover , it is important to stress here that even the scatter of the @xmath5 relation obtained in this analysis with the uncorrected x - ray luminosity is much lower than the dispersion obtained with the the rass - sdss galaxy cluster catalog , which is a sample more than 3 times larger . in fact",
    ", the sample of m98 covers a very small range in mass and x - ray luminosity , only one order of magnitude in both variables .",
    "hence , the statistical significance of the result is very low and it can not be taken as a robust result , since it does not seem to represent the behavior of the @xmath5 relation obtained with much larger samples of clusters .",
    "therefore , it is not clear if the presence of a large number of cool core clusters in our sample and in the sample of r02 could really contribute to the scatter in the @xmath5 relation . as a last point",
    ", we notice that replacing the @xmath4 calculated in the rosat energy band ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) with the bolometric luminosity does not change at all the scatter in the relation .",
    "the bolometric x - ray luminosity is taken from m98 .",
    "the slope of the @xmath186 relation is steeper then the @xmath187 relation as expected ( the bolometric correction is smaller for the faint x - ray clusters than in the bright ones ) , while the orthogonal scatter and the dispersion along the @xmath75 axis are unchanged .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath4 variable changes because of the slope , since @xmath188 . in conclusion , to really understand the nature of the scatter in the @xmath5 relation and its connection to the cool core correction to the x - ray luminosity , the analysis should be done with a cluster sample much larger than the m98 sample and with a much more extended range in mass and @xmath4 .    finally , let us consider the possibility that the better behavior of the optical luminosity as a mass predictor , in comparison with @xmath4 , could be due to the fact that @xmath3 is calculated within the same aperture of the mass ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) while @xmath4 is estimated within a variable aperture .",
    "r02 calculate the mass within @xmath1 and yet obtain the same scatter we observe in the @xmath5 relation .",
    "therefore , the scatter in the @xmath5 relation does not seem to depend on the limiting radius used to compute @xmath4 .",
    "the observed dispersion in the @xmath189 relation is most probably due to variations in the compactness of clusters .",
    "the dichotomy of compact cd clusters ( often associated with the cooling flow signatures ) and less compact non - cd clusters is more pronounced and significant than just an excess of x - ray flux in the central 70 kpc region ( as used in the above correction for cooling flows ) .",
    "this is indicated for example by the work of jones & forman ( 1984 ) and ota & mitsuda ( 2002 ) and discussed by fabian et al .",
    "due to the strong quadratic dependence of the x - ray emission on the gas density this variation in compactness is observed in an amplified way in the x - ray luminosity variation .",
    "the most important and interesting conclusion of this analysis is that both the optical and the x - ray luminosity show extremely good relations with the cluster mass within @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the optical luminosity correlates with the cluster mass better than the x - ray luminosity and can be used as mass estimator with an average accuracy of 40% in the mass determination .",
    "the x - ray luminosity can predict the cluster mass with an accuracy of 55% on average .",
    "the presence of a large number of cool core clusters in our sample does not seem to be the cause of the larger scatter in the @xmath5 relation in comparison to the @xmath159 relation .",
    "our result is in excellent agreement with that obtained by lin et al .",

    "as shown in table [ table1 ] the values of all the estimated scatters are very close to the values calculated for the @xmath5 relation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the scatter in the @xmath6 relation ( fig .",
    "[ lx_lo ] ) is mostly derived from the scatter in the @xmath5 relation .      to conclude the analysis of the relation between the optical luminosity and the cluster mass , we consider the mass - to - light ratio , m / l , as a function of the cluster mass .",
    "previous analyses have shown that , in general , m / l increases with the cluster mass . assuming a relation of the type @xmath190 , and adopting the usual scaling relations between mass and x - ray temperature or velocity dispersion , when needed , most authors have found @xmath191 , in both optical and near - infrared bands , and over a very large mass range , from loose groups to rich clusters of galaxies ( adami et al .",

    "@xmath3 is slightly a better predictor than @xmath4 with a 5% difference in the scatter .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , while @xmath3 is a much better predictor of the cluster mass in comparison to @xmath4 , optical and x - ray luminosities can predict approximately with the same accuracy ( 20% ) the intracluster temperature and the galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "this different behavior of the scatter in the relations involving @xmath4 could be due to the dependence of the x - ray luminosity and temperature on the cluster compactness .",
    "the cluster temperature is proportional to @xmath210 , where @xmath40 is the cluster mass and @xmath195 is a characteristic radius of the system .",
    "thus , @xmath2 is related to mass with a weighting for compactness . as explained in the previous paragraph",
    ", @xmath4 is proportional to the gas density squared .",
    "this implies that , at given mass , a compact cluster is much more x - ray bright than a less compact one .",
    "therefore , the cluster compactness could enter the @xmath5 relation as a third parameter , explaining the observed large scatter .",
    "however , since both @xmath4 and @xmath2 have a similar dependence on the compactness , the dispersion in the @xmath208 relation would not be affected .",
    "this would explain why @xmath3 is a better estimator of the cluster mass in comparison to @xmath4 , while optical and x - ray luminosities have similar scatter in their relation with @xmath2 and @xmath9 .",
    "as in the case of the luminosity - mass relation , we investigate in more details the luminosity - temperature relation to understand which of the two luminosities is the best predictor of the other cluster parameters .",

    "such a reduction of the scatter makes the x - ray luminosity a predictor of the x - ray temperature at least as good as the optical luminosity .",
    "however , a similar scatter reduction could in principle be expected for the @xmath211 relation also , since the cool - core correction affects x - ray temperatures much more than x - ray luminosities ( m98 ) .",
    "unfortunately only few of the clusters of the m98 sample are in the sky region covered by the sdss .",
    "thus , we can not check directly this possibility .",
    "we used the rass - sdss galaxy cluster sample to compare the quality of the optical and x - ray luminosity as predictors of other cluster properties such as the mass within @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the velocity dispersion and the icm temperature .",
    "the optical luminosity turns out to be a better predictor of the cluster mass than the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath3 allows to estimate the cluster mass with an average accuracy of 40% , while @xmath4 can be used to predict the mass with an average accuracy of 55% .",
    "we investigated the nature of the scatter of the @xmath5 relation using a sample of clusters with x - ray luminosity corrected for the effect of cool core at the center of the system .",
    "we concluded that this kind of effect can affect the scatter of the relation by at most 3% and , thus , it can not explain the dispersion in the observed @xmath5 relation , which is probably related with the variation in the compactness of the galaxy clusters .",
    "we conclude that a cluster optical luminosity is a better estimator of its mass than its x - ray luminosity .",
    "the optical luminosity is clearly a very useful and rather cheap estimator ( in terms of observational resources required ) given that it can be determined from ground - based photometric data only .",
    "we also analysed the relations of the optical and x - ray luminosities with cluster velocity dispersions and x - ray temperatures .",
    "we found that both luminosities are strongly correlated with these cluster properties , and can be used to predict them with an average accuracy of 20% . using a sample of clusters with @xmath4 and @xmath2 corrected for the cool core effect , we find that the scatter in the @xmath208 relation is decreased by 5% .",
    "such a decrease is almost exclusively due to the correction applied to the x - ray temperature , since the cool - core correction has a negligible effect on the x - ray luminosity .",
    "therefore , we expect a similar decrease of the scatter of the @xmath211 relation , when the x - ray temperatures are corrected for the same cool - core effect .",
    "unfortunately we can not verify this expectation on our sample , since we lack the information to apply the cool - core correction to the clusters with known @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be used to predict the icm temperature and the cluster velocity dispersion , at a similar level of accuracy .",
    "the most important conclusion of our analysis is that the optical luminosity is a key measure of the fundamental properties of a galaxy cluster , such as its mass , velocity dispersion , and temperature . in this respect ,",
    "the optical luminosity performs even better than the x - ray luminosity , which suggests that the mass distribution of a cluster is better traced by cluster galaxies rather than by intracluster gas ( see , e.g. , the discussion in biviano & girardi 2003 ) .",
    "the poorer performance of @xmath4 as a cluster mass predictor , relative to @xmath3 , is probably related to the variation in the compactness of the galaxy clusters .",
    "our conclusion is clearly in agreement with lin et al.s ( 2003 ) result , namely that the @xmath13-band luminosity is a good estimator of the cluster mass . on the other hand ,",
    "our conclusion is at odds with the generally accepted view that a cluster main physical properties are more easily revealed in the x - ray than in the optical ( e.g. donahue et al . 2002 ) .",
    "such a view was established at an epoch when the lack of optical wide field surveys precluded a reliable determination of the optical luminosities of a large sample of clusters . with the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ,",
    "this problem is now overcome , and @xmath3 can now be used to infer the fundamental physical properties of the many clusters being discovered within large optical surveys with improved cluster finding techniques ( such as , e.g. , the red - sequence cluster survey , barrientos et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this context @xmath3 becomes a very powerful mean to do cosmological studies with galaxy clusters without the need of optical or x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "finally , we showed that the relation between mass and luminosity implies an increasing mass - to - light ratio , m / l , with increasing cluster mass .",
