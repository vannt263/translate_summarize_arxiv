    "@xcite the fact that we can obtain excellent correspondence between the hydrodynamic radii for a filled raspberry and we find inferior agreement for the hollow variant , should be considered in the context of the level of discretization that is used .",

    "the ` filling + fitting ' procedure can be used to improve the raspberry model s ability to simulate both convex and non - convex solid particles .",

    "our ` filling + fitting ' procedure allows us to use a substantially reduced number of coupling points and still obtain excellent numerical agreement .",
    "* the force and velocity experiments traditionally performed to determine the translational mobility in a cubic geometry with periodic boundary conditions are problematic for small boxes compared to the particle size .",
    "the back force / velocity density that must be applied to the fluid to maintain zero center of mass velocity , leads to difficulties in interpreting the mobility data that is obtained from these experiments .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to identify the node locations at which the particle is found and to only apply the properly - rescaled counter force elsewhere .    from the above",
    ", it becomes clear that the raspberry model is an excellent way to approximate the long - time regime of the fluid - particle coupling for a solid object in an lb fluid .",
    "however , there remains several open problems to be addressed in future studies .",
    "we have shown that the short - time behavior of the raspberry model ( for the lb parameters used in this manuscript ) is quite different from the low reynolds number solution to stokes equations .",
