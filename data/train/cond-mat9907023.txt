    "since the experimental realisation of a bose einstein condensate ( bec ) in a weakly interacting gas @xcite , there has been a lot of interest in using similar techniques to produce a superior source for atom optics experiments , which are limited by the linewidth of thermal atomic sources .",
    "it was seen that to produce an atom laser , it was simply necessary to generate a bec and then coherently couple it to the outside world @xcite .",
    "this was first achieved with sodium atoms at mit by coupling a bec from a magnetically trapped state to an untrapped state using an rf pulse @xcite , and has since been repeated with long rf pulses @xcite and raman transitions @xcite .",
    "although the resultant matter waves have been the most monoenergetic source of atoms that have yet been produced , a gain - narrowed atom laser produced with a continuous pumping mechanism will have a spectral density which is orders of magnitude larger . in this paper",
    "we will describe a fully quantum mechanical model for such an atom laser which does not make the ( invalid ) born or markov approximations , and also does not make the mean field approximation .",
    "while a condensate is held in a trap , it is in an eigenstate of the system , and is therefore completely monoenergetic .",
    "if the trap is suddenly turned off or the condensate is quickly coupled into free space , then the resulting wavepacket will have a spread in energies due to the momentum spread of the trapped wavefunction .",
    "such a coupling tends to conserve momentum .",
    "coupling the atoms out slowly will tend to preserve the energy of the intial state , so a monoenergetic output will be achieved , but this is at the cost of reducing the atomic flux @xcite .",
    "a continuously pumped laser can have the best of both worlds . due to a competition between the pumping and the damping",
    ", it can produce an increasingly narrow energy spectrum in the output as the pumping and the output flux are increased .",
    "it is this feature that we wish to discover in our atom laser model .",
    "several theoretical models of a continuously pumped atom laser have been produced @xcite , but they have all made the born and markov approximations for the output coupling , which have since been shown to be invalid unless the output coupling rate is extremely small @xcite . in this paper",
    "we produce and solve a model for a continuously pumped atom laser which does not make these approximations .",
    "the early atom laser models are largely distinguished by their choice of cooling method , which was either some form of optical cooling @xcite , or evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "evaporative cooling appears to be less appropriate for a continuous process , but it is the only method which has experimentally reached the quantum degenerate regime in bec experiments . in all of these schemes , the model for the damping of",
    "the cavity was the same as that used in the master equation for the optical laser .",
    "the resulting equations were therefore very similar to optical laser equations .",
    "this means that they could be solved using similar methods , and were shown to produce analogous behaviour .",
    "we show here that a correct description of the output coupling leads to an irreducibly non - markovian damping , and can lead to different behaviour .    in an attempt to produce a more realistic description of the output coupling , we modelled a cavity from which atoms were coupled to free space via raman transitions @xcite .",
    "this allowed high intensities , spatial control and the possibility of giving the atoms a momentum kick from the lasers , which gave the outcoupled beam a direction .",
    "this was recently achieved by hagley _",
    "we also suggested placing the beam in an atomic waveguide such as a hollow optical fibre , which is a possible method of achieving good spatial properties , and an effectively one dimensional output .",
    "although the rate equations and the practicalities of the raman coupling scheme appeared favourable , it was necessary to produce a more complete theory in order to describe its full effects .    a quantum mechanical theory for the output coupling from an atomic cavity connected to an external field",
    "was then developed @xcite .",
    "this theory described the dynamics of a bec which is coupled to the outside world , but is not pumped by some continuous process .",
    "it was based on the optical input - output formalism developed by gardiner and collett @xcite , but it was complicated by the dispersive nature of the atomic field as compared to the linear energy spectrum for optical fields in free space . a general solution for the dynamics of the cavity and the external fields",
    "was presented in terms of laplace transforms , and an analytical solution was found for a simple form of the coupling @xcite .",
    "the quadratic nature of the dispersion relations in free space make the dynamics of atom - optical output coupling very similar to those of photon emission in materials with a photonic band gap . near the edges of these bands ,",
    "the dispersion relations are quadratic rather than linear , and this causes the model to behave in a non - markovian way .",
    "the same qualitative behaviour was found in treatments of this system as we found in our purely damped case for the atom laser @xcite .",
    "a complete model of an atom laser must also include the effect of interatomic interactions and a pumping mechanism .",
    "the effects of atom - atom interactions are included implicitly in the output coupling models which describe the fields using the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , which includes the effect of s - wave scattering @xcite .",
    "these models based on the nlse do not consider the effect of the coherences between the lasing mode and the external modes , and therefore implictly made a born approximation .",
    "in fact , all mean - field models are essentially semiclassical models , as they assume that the atoms in the lasing mode can be described by a spatial wavefunction with a predetermined set of quantum statistics .",
    "this makes it impossible to fully describe the behaviour of the pumping , and the dephasing of the laser mode must be added _ a posteriori_. the full quantum mechanical description allows us to calculate the quantum statistics using a microscopic model and physical parameters , and therefore allows us to calculate the linewidth of the resulting output .    unfortunately , interatomic interactions are very difficult to include in a full quantum mechanical model .",
    "we present a model of an atom laser which includes a pumping mechanism but assumes that atom - atom interactions are negligible . by making this approximation",
    "we have been able to model the output coupling without making the born - markov approximation , which is invalid in most physicially relevant parameter regimes .",
    "this is an accurate description of very dilute systems , and we show that it can be made self consistently with a laser operating well above threshold , as the threshold can be less than @xmath0 atoms in the laser mode @xcite .",
    "this restriction is made for calculational purposes rather than as a deliberate design criterion .",
    "the inclusion of the atom - atom interactions in full generality would require a multimode description of the intracavity field .",
    "as discussed above , the mean - field methods which have been so successful in simplifying this procedure can not be used without destroying the very information that we are trying to find .",
    "it may even be possible to use the single - mode approximation for the cavity after the system has reached a steady state , if this mode is derived self consistently . at this time , the number of atoms in the cavity may be reasonably well defined , and the complicated dynamics of the pumping process may be approximated by a linearised master equation term , as may be constructed for an optical laser @xcite .",

    "section [ sec : dampedonly ] shows how the solution behaves in the absence of pumping .",
    "section [ sec : pump ] derives the equations of motion for the system in the presence of pumping and discusses the physics of the various limits of the equations .",

    "section [ sec : gravity ] describes the features of the energy spectrum of the output of an atom laser in the presence of gravity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we discuss the possibilities for extending this model .",
    "we model the atom laser by separating it into three parts .",
    "the lasing mode is an atomic cavity with large energy spacing , and when it is operating in the quantum degenerate regime , it is effectively single - mode @xcite .",
    "we assume that the cavity is single - mode , with annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath1 and a hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "the external field has a different electronic state from the atoms , so the atoms are no longer necessarily affected by the trapping potential .",
    "we model the external modes with the field operators @xmath3 and the hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "the operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 satisfy the normal boson commutation relations .",
    "the coupling between the lasing mode and the output modes will be described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "the pump reservoir is coupled to the cavity by an effectively irreversible process . at this stage",
    ", we will describe the pump by the hamiltonian @xmath8 , which also couples the atoms from a pump reservoir into the system mode .",
    "the total hamiltonian is then written @xmath9 where @xmath10 and where @xmath11=[h_{o},a^{(\\dag)}]=[h_{(s , p)},\\psi^{(\\dag)}(x)]=0,\\ ] ] as the pump does not directly couple to the external modes .",
    "this is described in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "=    we then enter the interaction picture , leaving only @xmath7 .",
    "this gives us the interaction hamiltonian : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the system and output field operators in the interaction picture .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",

    "these functions can be written in closed form for several useful cases including : free space , free space with gravity , and a repulsive gaussian potential .",
    "we may use eq .",
    "[ eq : psih ] to calculate any observable in the output field that we desire , providing we know the complete history of the system , @xmath21 .",
    "this is a simplified version of the input - output relations for an atomic cavity .",
    "when the system is in a steady state , we are not interested in the external spectrum directly , as it is always growing .",
    "the quantity of interest is the output energy flux .",
    "we transform our interaction hamiltonian into the basis of the energy eigenstates of the output modes : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the annihilation operator associated with the eigenstate of @xmath4 that has a position space wavefunction @xmath25 and energy @xmath26 , and where @xmath27 .    we can then write the output energy flux in terms of the two - time correlation of the system .",
    "@xmath28 this assumes that at time @xmath29 , the output field was in the vacuum state .",
    "when the output field is in free space and the only term in @xmath4 is the kinetic energy , then the eigenstates are the momentum eigenstates . in this case",
    ", @xmath30 is just the fourier transform of @xmath31 .",
    "when there is a gravitational field , the eigenstates are airy functions with a displacement which depends on the energy : @xmath32      \\label{eq : graveig}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a normalisation constant , and the length scale is given by @xmath34 .",
    "in this case @xmath30 must be calculated numerically .",
    "we will now derive equations of motion for the system in the absence of pumping .",
    "when the cavity is not connected to the pump reservoir , we can find the heisenberg equations of motion for the system operator , and then use eq.([eq : psih ] ) to replace @xmath17 with system operators : @xmath35 where @xmath36    for most physical situations , the memory functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are simply functions of @xmath39 , which means that eq.([eq : adotnopump ] ) is a volterra equation of convolution type and can be solved using laplace transforms if the laplace transform of @xmath40 exists .",
    "this has been solved analytically for simple forms of the coupling in earlier work @xcite . in the limit where the decay of the system operator @xmath41 becomes slow compared to the decay of the memory function",
    ", the system operator can be taken out of the integral .",
    "this is a markov approximation , and leads to exponential decay of the trapped mode .",
    "the general solution approaches the markov solution as the strength of the coupling is turned down .",
    "coupling the atoms out at a finite rate causes a significantly non - exponential decay .",
    "the difference between the exact and the markov solutions is examined in detail in parallel work @xcite .",
    "the most surprising aspect of the exact solution is that it does not necessarily go to zero in the long time limit .",
    "if we continuously couple a single - mode in a trap to free space , then some of the initial population will disperse , but a certain fraction of the initial trapped atoms will remain in a non - dispersing eigenstate of the system and the coupling . even if a momentum kick is given to the atoms as they are coupled out , the bound eigenstate exists , although in this case it will have a lower occupation .    the mechanism for the production of this bound eigenstate can be best seen in a dressed state picture .",
    "in this picture , the mixed state which was originally in free space experiences an attractive quasipotential .",
    "let us find the eigenstate of this system explicitly :    as all of the evolution is coherent and we are not including interatomic interactions , the atoms are acting independently in first quantised picture , and we may use single particle quantum mechanics to describe the eigenstate .",
    "the state of the system is then described by a wavefunction @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the lasing mode and @xmath6 is the wavefunction outside the trap in the position basis , @xmath44 .",
    "the full hamiltonian is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass of the atom and @xmath47 is the shape of the coupling .",
    "this hamiltonian can describe a momentum kick on the atoms as they leave the trap by having a fourier transform of @xmath47 which is not centred around zero .",
    "the trapped eigenstate will be of the form @xmath48    the eigenvalue equation @xmath49 then leads to the following equations :    @xmath50    these are most easily solved in fourier space , so we take the fourier transform of both sides and define the fourier transforms : @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "we then show that the eigenvalue solves the equation @xmath53 and the corresponding eigenfunction is @xmath54    these equations can be solved analytically for some forms of the coupling @xmath55 , and in general they can be solved numerically . for reasonable physical parameters , there is a single bound eigenstate with negative energy .",
    "as the coupling is reduced , this eigenstate becomes more weakly bound .",
    "if there was a gravitational potential in the output field , then we would expect that these bound states would become metastable , and would eventually decay .",
    "this can be verified numerically @xcite .",
    "we would also expect atom - atom interactions to destroy this bound state , and in current experiments this is certainly the case , as the mean field interaction energy is much greater than the initial kinetic energy .    in the following figure",
    ", we show that when gravity is added to the model , the bound state does indeed decay .",
    "we have chosen a gaussian coupling with width @xmath56 , which has the form @xmath57 .",
    "we chose a weak gravitational field so that the short time behaviour is unchanged .    =    if we solve eq.([eq : eig1 ] ) and eq.([eq : eig2 ] ) for this example",
    ", we find that there is a bound eigenstate of energy @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "this means that @xmath60 of the original state of the system was in the eigenstate , and the rest has gone .",
    "it also means that @xmath60 of that remaining eigenstate will be in the trap at any one time .",
    "this means that @xmath61 of the initial population of the trap will remain in the trap in the long time limit , which is exactly what we see in our simulation .",
    "it is perhaps worth reiterating here that the analysis of this non - markovian system is almost identical to that found in the field of photonic band gaps .",
    "identical population trapping ( in this case photons rather than atoms ) has been calculated using identical analytical methods @xcite .",
    "there are problems in using the laplace transform method for slightly generalised models , however , even though the equations look almost identical .",
    "particular attention must be paid to the abscissa of convergence , as the laplace transforms of many physically interesting kernels do not exist at all . a numerical method based on laplace transforms",
    "will give incorrect answers in this case , and alternative methods must be employed .",
    "gravity is not the only possibility for modelling an output coupling which will eventually remove all of the atoms from the trap . in practice",
    ", interatomic interactions may also destroy the stabilty of this state .",
    "the largest potential seen by the output atoms other than gravity will be a repulsion from the trapped atoms .",
    "this is because the output atoms will be relatively dilute compared to the atoms which remain in the trap .",
    "this can be modelled by an external potential for the atoms which will repel them from the trap .",
    "we will assume that both of these effects are small so that we can continue to use our single - mode approximation for the lasing state .",
    "the existence of a trapped state when there is no pumping will lead to concern later , as it will mean that pumping will cause the population of the trapped state to increase indefinitely , and no steady state will be reached .",
    "when the model is generalised to include the possibility of pumping , the individual heisenberg operators @xmath41 in the two - time correlation can no longer be calculated , so the same techniques for finding a solution do not apply . in the next section",
    "we will derive the equation describing the two - time correlation of the cavity field in the presence of pumping .",
    "if the pump reservoir is sufficiently isolated from the cavity and external fields , and the pumping process is designed to be irreversible , then we may trace over the reservoir states to produce a master equation for a reduced density matrix which describes only the cavity and the external fields .",
    "one example of a pumping process which can satisfy these requirements can be found in our earlier model , where cooled atoms in an excited state are passed over the trap containing the lasing mode @xcite .",
    "the photon emission of the atoms would be stimulated by the presence of the highly occupied ground state , and they will make a transition into that state and emit a photon @xcite . for a sufficiently optically thin sample , which can be made possible by having a very tight , effectively low dimensional trap ,",
    "the photon is unlikely to be reabsorbed , and the process is effectively irreversible .",
    "we choose to model an optical cooling process rather than the more experimentally successful evaporative cooling process as we are particularly interested in designing a continuously pumped system with a steady state .",
    "after we have traced over the pump modes , we will produce a term due to the effect of the pump in the master equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath62 .",
    "it is important to note that we are not tracing over the output field modes , so our reduced density matrix spans the output field as well as the cavity field .",
    "we derive a pumping term based on an approach similar to that followed by scully and lamb @xcite and found in standard quantum optics texts @xcite .",
    "we model pumping by the injection of a poissonian sequence of excited atoms into the atom laser .",
    "these atoms may spontaneously emit a photon and make a transition into the atom lasing mode .",
    "alternatively , they may make a transition into other modes of the lasing cavity . for simplicity , we consider an effective two - mode approximation . to obtain the pumping term",
    ", we consider the effect of a single atom injected into the atom laser , and then extend this to describe the effect of a distribution of atoms .",
    "this gives a master equation describing pumping in the number state basis of the lasing mode @xmath63 , where each of these elements still include the output field .",
    "this equation can be expressed as @xmath64 \\left (   n_{s } + { \\cal a}[a^{\\dag}]\\right)^{-1 }   \\rho . \\label{eq.mastereqn3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superoperators @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined by @xmath67 & = & { \\cal j}[c ] - { \\cal a}[c ] , \\\\ { \\cal j}[c ] \\rho & = & c \\rho c^{\\dag},\\\\ { \\cal a}[c ] \\rho & = & \\frac{1}{2}(c^{\\dag}c \\rho + \\rho c^{\\dag}c ) .",

    "@xmath69 depends on the ratio of the probability that an atom will spontaneously emit into the lasing mode and the probability that the atom will emit into another mode .",
    "this pump process is markovian for the same reasons that damping in optical lasers is markovian , as there are photons being lost from the system .",
    "we may write this pumping term in the number basis , @xmath70 : @xmath71 at this stage , the elements @xmath72 are operators which contain the state of the output modes . for optical lasers",
    ", we usually make the born and markov approximations at this stage .",
    "this is not possible for atom lasers except in extreme parameter limits , but we will review the results than can be obtained with these approximations so that we can compare them with the exact results .",
    "the born approximation assumes that the density matrix @xmath62 can be separated into the product of the reduced density matrix for the system @xmath73 , and the reduced density matrix for the output field .",
    "it further assumes that the output field remains in its original state .",
    "if we then trace over the output field modes , we obtain a master equation for the lasing mode which has the same pumping term as given above @xcite .",

    "we proceed by finding the equation of motion for the expectation value of the field operator : @xmath93 where we have used the fact that the number distribution is localised to replace @xmath94 by @xmath90 in the denominator . by expanding the exact expression as a taylor series in @xmath95",
    ", we see that there is an error term of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "this is awkward , as if the first order terms cancel then the linewidth will be of this order .",
    "this is in fact what we are hoping to discover , as it will mean that the spectrum will become more narrow as we increase the pumping of the laser .",
