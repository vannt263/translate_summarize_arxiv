    "the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional physics system presents many interesting surprises , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "for example , in last three decades , it has been realized that while in three and higher space dimensions the particles must be either bosons or fermions , in two space dimensions the particles can have any fractional spin and can satisfy any fractional statistics which interpolates between the familiar two.@xcite the particles obeying such statistics are called as anyons , whose existence in real physics system have been proved by the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite where anyons act as fractionally charged excitations of the imcompressible quantum fluid .    in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime ,",
    "a new type of gauge theory named chern - simons theory which is different from maxwell theory plays a very significant role in many aspects.@xcite one of the most remarkable properties of the chern - simons action is that it does not depends on the metric tensor , and always has the same form no matter the spacetime is flat or not .",
    "hence , the chern - simons theory is an important example of the topological field theory.@xcite there are both topological and nontopological self - dual vortex solutions in the chern - simons model.@xcite and topology is indispensable even in the situation where only the nontopological vortex solutions are present .    on the other hand , for over four decades",
    "there has been a wide interest in the condensed - matter systems with several coexisting bose condensates.@xcite recent research@xcite has revealed that a charged two - condensate ginzburg - landau model can be mapped onto a version of the nonlinear @xmath1 @xmath2 model .",
    "this leads to many efforts to study the topological property behind the two - condensate system.@xcite    in light of @xmath0-mapping topological current method,@xcite the present paper investigates the self - dual vortices in the abelian chern - simons model with two complex scalar fields , which is a kind of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional field theory generalization of the two - condensate system .",
    "to be self - contained basically , in sec .",
    "[ secmap ] , we briefly review the @xmath0-mapping topological current method . in sec .",
    "[ secmodel ] , we introduce the model to be considered , and derive a set of self - dual equations . in sec .",
    "[ secvortex ] , we find a nontrivial equation with a topological term for each scalar field , which is the development of our previous work,@xcite and also obtain an equation which relates the two scalar fields by their topological terms . besides , the angular momentum and the magnetic flux of the system are calculated . in sec .",
    "[ secbranch ] , we briefly consider the evolution processes of the vortices , and find that because of the present of the vortex molecule , the detailed evolution processes of the vortices in the double scalar field model is more complicated than the vortex evolution processes in the corresponding single scalar field model , which have been investigated in ref . in detail .",
    "because the @xmath0-mapping topological current method is unfamiliar to most of the readers , we will briefly review it in the following . consider a d - dimensional smooth manifold with metric tensor @xmath3 and local coordinates @xmath4 .",
    "define a map @xmath5 : @xmath6 and introduce the direction unit field of @xmath7 : @xmath8 using @xmath9 , we can construct a topological tensor current : @xmath10 it is not difficult to find that @xmath11 is completely antisymmetric and identically conserved",

    "some important physical quantities concerning the topology , say magnetic flux , can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ jmn02 ] ) . by virtue of the implicit function",
    "theorem,@xcite the irregular points of @xmath7 correspond to the branch points of the topological current @xmath11 , and the branch processes of @xmath11 occur at these very points .",
    "these branch processes can describe various evolutions of the topological defects , and the total topological charge of the system will keep unchange during these evolutions since @xmath11 is a conserved current .",
    "we consider the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional chern - simons system described by the lagrangian @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 , and @xmath34 here , coupling @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath0 are complex scalar fields , @xmath37 denotes the chern - simons gauge field .",
    "the specific form of the potential ( [ u ] ) gives rise to a self - dual system .",
