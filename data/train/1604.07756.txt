    "consider the propagation of an electromagnetic wave which is excited by electric current density and is scattered by infinite rough surfaces .",
    "an infinite rough surface is a non - local perturbation of an infinite plane surface such that the whole surface lies within a finite distance of the original plane .",
    "the goal of this paper is to examine the electromagnetic scattering problem of time - domain maxwell s equation in such an unbounded structure .",
    "the problem studied in this work falls into the class of rough surface scattering problems , which arise from various applications such as modeling acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation over outdoor ground and sea surfaces , optical scattering from the surface of materials in near - field optics or nano - optics , detection of underwater mines , especially those buried in soft sediments .",
    "these problems are widely studied in the literature and various methods have been investigated @xcite .",
    "the infinite rough surfaces scattering problems are quite challenging due to unbounded domains . the usual sommerfeld ( for acoustic waves ) or silver  mller ( for electromagnetic waves )",
    "radiation condition is not valid any more @xcite .",
    "the fredholm alternative theorem is not applicable due to the lack of compactness result .",
    "we refer to @xcite for some mathematical studies on the two - dimensional helmholtz equation .",
    "the rigorous mathematical analysis is very rare for the three - dimensional maxwell equations . in @xcite , the electromagnetic scattering by unbounded rough surfaces",
    "was considered by assuming that the medium was lossy in the entire space .",
    "the well - posedness was established by a direct application of the lax ",
    "milgram theorem after showing that the sesquilinear form was coercive . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered the electromagnetic scattering by an unbounded dielectric medium which was deposited on a perfectly electrically conducting plate .",
    "based on the limiting absorption principle , the problem was shown to have a unique weak solution from a prior estimates .",
    "the magnetic permeability was assumed to be a constant and the electric current was assumed to be divergence free .",
    "the assumption was also restrictive for the dielectric permittivity . in @xcite , the generalized lax ",
    "milgram theorem was adopted to establish the well - posedness for the same problem as that in @xcite .",
    "although all the assumptions were relaxed , such as the magnetic permeability was allowed to be a variable function and the divergence free condition was removed for the electric current , the assumption was still quite restrictive for the dielectric permittivity . despite the tremendous effort made so far ,",
    "it is still unclear what the least restrictive conditions are for the dielectric permittivity and the magnetic permeability to assure the well - posedness of the time - harmonic maxwell equations in unbounded structures .",
    "ultimately , one wishes to answer the following question : is the scattering problem in unbounded structures well - posed for the real and dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability ?    in this work , an initial attempt is made to study the time - domain electromagnetic scattering by infinite rough surfaces for the most difficult case of the time - harmonic counterpart : the dielectric permittivity and the magnetic permeability are assumed to be real and bounded measurable functions . an exact time - domain transparent boundary condition ( tbc )",
    "is developed to reduce the scattering problem into an initial - boundary value problem in an infinite rectangular slab . to show the well - posedness",
    ", we split the reduced problem into two sub - problems : one has homogeneous initial conditions and another has a homogeneous boundary condition .",
    "hence two auxiliary scattering problems need to be considered : one is the time - harmonic maxwell equations with a complex wavenumber and another is the time - domain maxwell equations with perfectly electrically conducting ( pec ) boundary condition . based on the stability results for the auxiliary problems , the reduced problem is shown to have a unique solution .",
    "our proofs rely on the laplace transform , the lax  milgram theorem , and the parseval identity between the frequency domain and the time - domain .",
    "moreover , a priori estimates , featuring an explicit dependence on the time and a minimum regularity requirement of the initial conditions and the source term , are established for the electric field by studying directly the time - domain maxwell equations .",
    "the time - domain scattering problems have recently attracted considerable attention due to their capability of capturing wide - band signals and modeling more general material and nonlinearity @xcite , which motivates us to tune our focus from seeking the best possible conditions for those physical parameters to the time - domain problem .",
    "comparing with the time - harmonic problems , the time - domain problems are less studied due to the additional challenge of the temporal dependence .",
    "the analysis can be found in @xcite for the time - domain acoustic and electromagnetic obstacle scattering problems .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the analysis of the time - dependent electromagnetic scattering from a three - dimensional open cavity .",
    "numerical solutions can be found in @xcite for the time - dependent wave scattering by periodic structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ pf ] ,",
    "the model problem is introduced and reduced equivalently into an initial - boundary value problem by using a tbc .",
    "some regularity properties of the trace operator are presented . in section [ at ] , two auxiliary problems of maxwell s equations are discussed to pave the way for the analysis of the main result in section [ rp ] .",
    "section [ rp ] is devoted to the well - posedness and stability of the reduced time - domain maxwell equations and a priori estimates of the solution .",
    "the paper is concluded with some general remarks in section [ rem ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the model problem and present an exact time - domain transparent boundary condition to reduce the scattering problem into an initial - boundary value problem in an infinite rectangular slab .",
