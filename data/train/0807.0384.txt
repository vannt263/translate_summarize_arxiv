    "anisotropy of molecular interactions plays an important role in many physical , chemical and biological processes .",
    "attractive forces are responsible for the tendency toward particle association , while the directionality of the resulting bonds determines the geometry of the resulting clusters . aggregation may thus lead to very different structures : in particular , chains , globular forms , and bi- or three - dimensional networks . understanding the microscopic mechanisms underlying",
    "such phenomena is clearly very important both from a theoretical and a technological point of view .",
    "polymerization of inorganic molecules , phase behaviour of non - spherical colloidal particles , building up of micelles , gelation , formation of @xmath5-helices from biomolecules , dna - strands , and other ordered structures in living organisms , protein folding and crystallization , self - assembly of nanoparticles into composite objects designed for new materials , are all subjects of considerable interest , belonging to the same class of systems with anisotropic interactions .",
    "modern studies on these complex systems strongly rely upon computer simulations , which have provided a number of useful information about many properties of molecular fluids .    nevertheless , analytic models with explicit expressions for structural and thermodynamic properties still represent an irreplaceable tool , in view of their ability of capturing the essential features of the investigated physical systems .    at the lowest level in this hierarchy of minimal models on assembling particles",
    "lies the problem of the formation of linear aggregates , from dimers @xcite up to polymer chains .",
    "this topic has been extensively investigated , through both computer simulations and analytical methods . in the latter case",
    "a remarkable example is wertheim s analytic solution of the _ mean spherical approximation _ ( msa )",
    "integral equation for dipolar hard spheres ( dhs ) , i.e. hard spheres ( hs ) with a point dipole at their centre @xcite ( hereafter referred to as i ) . for the dhs model ,",
    "several studies predict chain formation , whereas little can be said about the existence of a fluid - fluid coexistence line , since computer simulations and mean field theories provide contradictory results @xcite . on the other hand , for mesoscopic fluids the importance of combining _",
    "short - ranged _ anisotropic attractions and repulsions has been well established gazzillo06,fantoni07 , and hence the long - range of the dipolar interaction is less suited for the mesoscopic systems considered here , at variance with their atomistic counterpart .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to address both the above points , by studying a model with anisotropic surface adhesion that is amenable to an analytical solution , within an approximation which is expected to be valid at significant experimental regimes .    in the isotropic case , the first model with ` surface adhesion '",
    "was introduced long time ago by baxter @xcite .",
    "the interaction potential of these ` sticky hard spheres ' ( shs ) includes a hs repulsion plus a spherically symmetric attraction , described by a square - well ( sw ) which becomes infinitely deep and narrow , according to a limiting procedure ( baxter s sticky limit ) that keeps the second virial coefficient finite .",
    "possible anisotropic variations include ` sticky points '  sciortino05,bianchi06,michele06,lomakin99,starr03,zhang04,glotzer04a , glotzer04b , sciortino07 , ` sticky patches '  jackson88,ghonasgi95,sear99,mileva00,kern03,zhang05,fantoni07 and , more recently , ` gaussian patches '  @xcite .",
    "the most common version of patchy sticky models refers to hs with one or more ` uniform circular patches ' , all of the same species .",
    "this kind of patch has a well - defined circular boundary on the particle surface , and is always attractive , with an ` uniform ' strength of adhesion , which does not depend on the contact point within the patch @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a ` dipolar - like ' shs model , where the sum of a uniform surface adhesion ( isotropic background ) plus an appropriate dipolar sticky correction  which can be both positive or negative , depending on the orientations of the particles  yields a nonuniform adhesion .",
    "although the adhesion varies continuously and no discontinuous boundary exists , the surface of each molecule may be regarded as formed by two hemispherical ` patches ' ( colored red and blue , respectively , in the online figure 1 ) .",
    "one of these hemispheres is ` stickier ' than the other , and the entire molecular surface is adhesive , but its stickiness is nonuniform and varies in a dipolar fashion . by varying the dipolar contribution , the degree of anisotropy can be changed , in such a way that the total sticky potential can be continuously tuned from very strong attractive strength ( twice the isotropic one ) to vanishing adhesion ( hs limit ) .",
    "the physical origin of this model may be manifold ( non - uniform distribution of surface charges , or hydrophobic attraction , or other physical mechanisms ) , one simple realization being as due to an ` extremely screened ' attraction .",
    "the presence of a solvent together with a dense ionic atmosphere could induce any electrostatic interaction to vanish close to the molecular surface , and  in the idealized sticky limit  to become _ truncated _ exactly at contact .    for this model ,",
    "we solve analytically the molecular ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equation , by using a truncated _ percus - yevick _ ( py ) approximation , _ with orientational linearization _",
    "( py - ol ) , since it retains only the lowest order terms in the expansions of the correlation functions in angular basis functions .",
    "this already provides a clear indication of the effects of anisotropy on the adhesive adhesion .",
    "the idea of an anisotropic surface adhesion is not new . in a series of papers on hydrogen - bonded fluids such a water , blum and",
    "co - workers cummings86,wei88,blum90 already studied models of spherical molecules with anisotropic pair potentials , including both electrostatic multipolar interactions and sticky adhesive terms of multipolar symmetry . within appropriate closures",
    ", these authors outlined the general features of the analytic solutions of the oz equation by employing a very powerful formalism based upon expansions in rotational invariants .",
    "in particular , blum , cummings and bratko @xcite obtained an analytic solution within a mixed msa / py closure ( extended to mixtures by protsykevich protsykevich03 ) for molecules which have surface adhesion of dipolar symmetry and at most dipole - dipole interactions . from the physical point of view , our model  with ` dipolar - like ' adhesion resulting from the sum of an isotropic plus a dipolar term  is different and more specifically characterized with respect to the one of ref .",

    "@xcite could also be applied to our model .",
    "unfortunately , the solution given in ref .",
    "[ 32 ] is not immediately usable for the actual computation of correlation functions , since the explicit determination of the parameters involved in their analytical expressions is lacking .    in the present paper",
    "we adopt a simpler solution method , by extending the elegant approach devised by wertheim for dhs within the msa closure wertheim71 , and , most importantly , we aim at providing a _ complete _ analytic solution  including the determination of all required parameters  within our py - ol approximation .    the paper is organized as follows .",
