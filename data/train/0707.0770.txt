    "the conditional displacement operator ( cdo ) has been extensively used in the literature , e.g. , by milburn and walls @xcite in quantum nondemolition measurements via quantum counting ; by ban @xcite in theoretical studies of the photon statistics in the four - wave mixer ; and by avelar _",
    "@xcite in measurements of wigner characteristic function describing field states of running waves . in cavity",
    "qed , zou _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed the creation of the cdo through a two - level atom interacting with a single - mode cavity field and driven additionally by an external classical field .",
    "the authors used this scheme for the measurements of the wigner characteristic function .",
    "it has been employed also for the generation of nonclassical states weber07,souza07 .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there is no suggestion on how to implement this operator in a reliable way for arbitrary quantum states in running waves .    here",
    "we present a calculation which shows how to displace conditionally arbitrary ( pure or mixed ) quantum states using a kerr medium placed between two beam splitters ( along the path of the signal beam ) whose respective second ports are fed by appropriate , highly excited , coherent states . as applications , we show how to engineer for running waves the even ( @xmath1 ) and odd ( @xmath2 ) superpositions of an arbitrary single - mode state with its displaced counterparts , @xmath3 . to this end",
    "the cdo device is coupled to one arm of a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) fed by the vacuum and one - photon states , as applied for kerr medium by sanders and milburn @xcite to investigate complementarity in a quantum nondemolition measurement .",
    "the present scheme constitutes a modification of another one proposed by villas - bas _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to measure directly the wigner function . as a by - product",
    ", it is shown that our scheme allows one to measure the wigner caracteristic function of the state @xmath4 through the measurement of photon - detection probabilities in the output of the mzi .",
    "a schematic diagram of the procedure is shown in fig .  [ cdo ] . both beam splitters ( bs1 and bs2 )",
    "produce the action of the displacement operator @xmath5 on a quantum state of the field - mode @xmath6 , when the second port is fed by highly excited coherent states @xmath7 and @xmath8 as shown in @xcite .",
    "thus , after the bs1 the state describing the whole system becomes @xmath9where @xmath10 , with @xmath11 standing for the reflectance of the bs1 .",
    "the dispersive kerr interaction between modes @xmath6 and @xmath12 is described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is proportional to the third - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath15 .",
    "so , the action of the kerr medium upon ( bipartite ) field states is represented by the unitary operator , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the length of the kerr - medium and @xmath19 the velocity of light in the medium . due to the action of the hamiltonian ( hkerr ) upon the modes @xmath6 and @xmath12 , and the action of the bs2 corresponding to a second displacement , the state of the system evolves to @xmath20    next , a little algebra furnishes @xmath21and for realistic kerr - media small values of phase shifts @xmath22 are produced in laboratories ; so , when adjusting the device to high values of @xmath23 the foregoing equation becomes @xmath24where @xmath25 , with @xmath26 finite , and @xmath27   \\label{ucdo}\\]]is the wanted cdo .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ aprox ] ) is an algebraic operator relation , and so , it does not depend on the input state of the cdo device .",
    "the superposed state of the kind @xmath32 in traveling waves has interesting applications in the literature .",
    "for example , setting @xmath33 and @xmath34 one obtains the even ( @xmath1 ) and odd ( @xmath2 ) schrdinger s cat states @xmath35 one obtains the superposition of the vacuum state and a coherent state , @xmath36 , yielding the superposition @xmath37    to prepare the superposition @xmath32 one needs a mzi associated with an auxiliary cdo and a phase shifter ( ps ) , both inserted in one arm ( _ mode b _ ) of the mzi .",
    "the schematic setup is depicted in the fig .",
    "[ mach - zehnder ] .",
    "the cdo couples one of the internal modes of the mzi ( mode @xmath12 ) with an external mode ( _ mode a _ ) where a field in the state @xmath38 is injected .",
    "measurements of the probability of photon detection in the output of the mzi allow us the preparation of the superposition @xmath32 in the mode @xmath6 , as follows .",
    "consider the states @xmath39 and @xmath40 entering the ideal @xmath41 symmetric bs1 of the mzi , whose action upon them , such as that of the bs2 , is described by the following transformations @xcite @xmath42 the ps is assumed to add a phase @xmath43 to the field crossing it .",
    "thus , just after the bs1 and the ps the ( entangled ) state of the whole system reads , @xmath44 where the state @xmath45 in the second member stands for the initial state entering the mode @xmath6 .",
    "now , the action of the cdo device on the state @xmath46 is obtained from the relations @xmath47and , after the bs2 , the state of the whole system can be written as @xmath48 \\,|\\psi \\rangle _ { a}\\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left .",
    "i|1\\rangle _ { b}|0\\rangle _ { c}\\left [ e^{i\\xi } + { \\widehat{d}}% _ { a}(\\beta ) \\right ] \\,|\\psi \\rangle _ { a}\\right\\ } ,   \\label{psi3}\\end{aligned}\\]]with @xmath49 .",
    "note that in this scheme the ps turns irrelevant the action of the additional factor @xmath50 ) .",
    "at this point we can see that if the detector d1 fires ( does not fire ) while d2 does not fire ( fires ) this corresponds to the output state @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) in the bs2 , and the mode@xmath53 is projected onto the state @xmath54",
    "\\,|\\psi \\rangle _ { a}. \\label{basiliana}\\]]finally , up to a global phase , our wanted state @xmath55 is obtained from the eq .",
    "( [ basiliana ] ) ; this can be achieved by adjusting the ps such that @xmath56 .      as discussed previously in @xcite , a mzi supplemented by a nonlinear medium",
    "allows us to measure the wigner characteristic functions of field states in traveling waves , yielding the reconstruction of the wigner functions themselves .",
    "the scheme in @xcite employs a mzi associated with an auxiliary ( specific ) four - wave mixer that entangles the field state in one arm of the apparatus with an external field crossing it .",
    "we now show in which way the cdo implemented here can be used to measure the wigner function . to this end , we start from the success probabilities @xmath57 and @xmath58 to get the states given in the eq .",
    "( [ basiliana ] ) .",
    "actually , in the present scenario these properties furnish the values of wigner characteristic function of the state @xmath59 . as the photodetection experiment",
    "is repeated many times , starting from the same initial field state @xmath60 , one obtains the probabilities @xmath61 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{proba } \\\\",
    "p_{10}(\\beta , \\xi _ { 0 } ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{re}\\left\\ { e^{-i\\xi _ { 0}}\\mathrm{tr}\\left [ { \\widehat{d}_{a}}(\\beta ) \\hat{\\rho}_{a}% \\right ] \\right\\ } ,   \\label{proba2}\\end{aligned}\\]]leading to @xmath62,\\end{aligned}\\]]where the relation @xmath63 $ ] has been employed @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite the measurement of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) furnishes the real ( imaginary ) part of the characteristic function .",
    "so , one gets @xmath66these two measurements actually lead to values of @xmath67 at two points ( namely , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) owing to the property @xmath70 .",
    "now , since the wigner function is the fourier transform of the characteristic function @xmath71 , namely , @xmath72the determination of @xmath67 for a reasonable set of values permits the reconstruction of the wigner function of the original state of the external mode @xmath6 .",
    "we note that @xmath68 is a free - parameter in the eq .",
    "( [ wigner ] ) and , since @xmath25 where @xmath73 was assumed to be large and @xmath22 takes small values in the experiment , then @xmath68 can be varied in the range of interest through the control of the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "in summary , this report introduces a method to engineer the conditional displacement operator in running fields via a kerr - medium placed between two beam - splitters .",
    "this device , when conveniently inserted in one arm of a mach - zehnder interferometer , allows one to prepare states of the kind @xmath74 with the interesting applications mentioned in the sect .",
    "2.a , and the measurement of their wigner functions ( sect.2.b ) .",
    "the procedure is also valid for mixed states .",
    "concerning with the reliability of the scheme , it is supported by recent technological advances which have achieved photodetectors with efficiency near @xmath75 @xcite and stable single - photon sources yielding many single photons , e.g. , using : single quantum dots @xcite ; single molecules @xcite ; diamond colour centers @xcite ; atoms kuhn00 ; turnstile devices @xcite ; and also traditional parametric down conversion methods @xcite . with respect to the wigner function , it is worth mentioning a pertinent comparison between the present scheme and the ref .",
    "@xcite : in @xcite the wigner function is measured directly and in this aspect it is advantageous .",
    "however , villas01 requires a very large nonlinear susceptibility yielding @xmath76 , whose experimental implementation is very hard till now . here",
    ", our goal is achieved via the use of small values of phase - shifts @xmath22 , available in laboratories through realistic kerr - medium , which constitutes a remarkable result from the experimental point of view , a feature having no guarantee in ref . @xcite .",
    "in fact , following various trials to get large kerr nonlinearities kerr , a recent result by munro _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has achieved phase shifts @xmath22 @xmath77 , with residual absorption rates less than @xmath78 .",
    "finally , we mention that decoherence effects , not considered here , could be included via the phenomenological operator approach , as implemented in @xcite .",
