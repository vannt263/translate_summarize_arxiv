    "amorphous solids such as foams , dense colloids , bulk metallic glasses , and granular fault gouge are ubiquitous in engineering applications and natural systems . although these materials exhibit a yield stress on experimental time scales , they flow , deform , and fail in a manner which is different from crystalline solids or newtonian fluids . many of these materials undergo strain localization , where a small region deforms much more rapidly than adjacent regions . for example , bulk metallic glasses develop very thin shear bands  @xcite , fault gouge in earthquake faults develops a prominent fracture surface that accommodates most of the slip  @xcite , and colloidal systems develop broad shear bands  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the mechanisms that lead to this strain localization have remained elusive .",
    "an early theory of shear banding  @xcite suggests that a small increase in the thermal temperature lowers the viscosity , resulting in more rapid deformation and a local increase in temperature .",
    "however , lewandowski and greer showed that shear bands in bulk metallic glasses can not be explained by adiabatic thermal effects  @xcite .",
    "although thermal heating must play a role at high strain rates , it does not appear to govern the formation of shear bands in many materials .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , we found that at low strain rates the shear transformation zone ( stz ) theory for amorphous solids predicts shear band formation .",
    "these bands are generated by feedback between the local strain rate and the configurational disorder of an amorphous packing . in a separate paper  @xcite , we used stz theory to fit data over a wide range of strain rates from a simulation of glassy disks by haxton and liu  @xcite .",
    "these data indicate that dynamics of the glassy material change dramatically at large strain rates .",
    "experimental studies of bulk metallic glasses driven at a wide range of strain rates also show that deformation is strain rate dependent .",
    "homogeneous deformation is seen at low strain rates and inhomogeneous flows dominate at large strain rates  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study deformation in the stz model as a function of the initial material preparation and externally imposed strain rate , and include the rate dependence observed by haxton and liu in our model .",
    "this stz formulation is valid for a large range of strain rates and predicts four different types of deformation behavior : homogeneous deformation , thick disorder limited shear bands , thin diffusion limited shear bands , and material failure .",
    "we will discuss these various types of deformation in detail in the following sections .",
    "we describe the mechanism that generates shear bands and the processes that determine the thickness and longevity of these inhomogeneous flows .",
    "we numerically integrate the stz equations to produce a deformation map for the model glass simulated by haxton and liu that shows the type of deformation or failure predicted as a function of the initial conditions .",
    "shear bands in this stz formulation occur due to a feedback between the effective temperature , which describes the configurational disorder in a glassy or jammed material , and the local strain rate . in a sheared , steady state , non equilibrium amorphous material ,",
    "the effective temperature can be calculated by measuring the fluctuations and linear response of an observable such as the pressure and applying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt )  @xcite .",
    "ono , _ et al .",
    "_ have shown that in several simulated foams , measurements of different observables yield a single , rate dependent steady state effective temperature which is distinct from the thermal temperature  @xcite .",
    "in addition , these authors show that the fdt effective temperature is consistent with an entropic definition : the effective temperature is the derivative of the configurational entropy with respect to the ( potential ) energy .",
    "this definition suggests that slow steady shearing causes the material to ergodically explore all possible configurational packings , and therefore the system maximizes a configurational entropy .",
    "the stz model describes plastic deformation in amorphous material as a series of localized plastic events that occur in susceptible regions , or zones  @xcite . following falk and langer , we model stzs as bistable regions that are more likely than the surrounding material to deform under stress , and are created and annihilated as energy is dissipated in the system  @xcite .",
    "this model has successfully been used to describe bulk metallic glasses , thin films , and hard spheres in several different geometries  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of all stz formulations is that the zones are activated by an effective temperature or free volume , and there is a feedback between packing structure and deformation . in particular , we postulate that an stz is an unlikely , high energy configuration of an amorphous packing .",
    "because the effective temperature governs the statistics of configurational packings , the steady state density of stzs should correspond to a boltzmann factor , @xmath0 \\equiv \\ ; \\exp \\left[-\\frac{1 } { \\chi } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is proportional to the steady state stz density , @xmath2 is an activation energy , @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 is the effective temperature , and @xmath5 is a dimensionless effective temperature  @xcite .    because plastic deformation occurs only at these stzs , the plastic strain rate in simple shear is proportional to this density , and in many situations can be written as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is strain , @xmath8 is a function of the deviatoric stress @xmath9 and @xmath10 is an internal timescale such as the phonon frequency . for the remainder of this paper we will refer to the dimensionless plastic strain rate ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 is the imposed average strain rate times the stz time scale .    for completeness",
    ", appendix  [ sec : rdmodel_detail ] reviews the stz model and defines the exact equations and parameters used in this work .",
    "the model is vastly simplified by focusing on materials in a simple shear geometry at thermal temperatures far below the glass transition temperature , and can be summarized by two equations .",
    "the first specifies that elastic deformation increases the shear stress , while plastic deformation decreases it : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ratio of the elastic modulus to the yield stress , and @xmath15 is the spatial average of the stz density @xmath16 . in writing this equation",
    "we have assumed that the deviatoric stress is constant across the width of the sample , as discussed in the appendix .",
    "a second equation specifies that the effective temperature approaches its steady state value , @xmath17 as plastic work is dissipated , and it also diffuses : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a dimensionless specific heat , @xmath20 is a diffusion length scale on the order of an stz radius , and @xmath21 is the stress threshold for the onset of plastic deformation . for the remainder of this paper ,",
    "a symbol with an overline denotes a quantity that is a spatial average or constant as a function of position . the function @xmath8 is described in the appendix .",
    "the remaining unspecified component of eq .",
    "[ dot - chi ] is the steady state effective temperature @xmath22 .",
    "this material dependent parameter captures the physically intuitive idea that there is a maximum possible disorder attained in a sheared amorphous packing ; above @xmath23 no heat can be dissipated in the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "recent simulations by haxton and liu  @xcite suggest that the steady state effective temperature is dependent on the plastic strain rate , denoted @xmath24 . in steady state , the inverse strain rate @xmath25 can be viewed as a function of the steady state effective temperature @xmath22 , much like the viscosity is a function of the thermal temperature @xmath26 .",
    "we have shown  @xcite that the the glassy steady state effective temperature is well fit by the following functional form : @xmath27,\\ ] ] a discussion of this effective temperature glass transition is given in  @xcite , we adopt the super - arrhenius function @xmath28 identified in that paper : @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the thermal glass transition temperature , @xmath31 is the temperature at which the system begins to exhibit arrhenius behavior , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 are fit parameters .",
    "the super - arrhenius component ( eq .  ( [ alpha_effrd ] ) ) ensures that the effective temperature approaches a constant , @xmath30 , as the strain rate approaches zero , which is seen in simulations .",
    "as noted above , this paper focuses on deformation in geometries where the equilibrium shear stress is constant across the sample .",
    "although there are many interesting geometries with shear stress gradients ( and stz theory can explain these shear bands  @xcite ) , often in these cases stress effects compete with internal structural effects and complicate the analysis . in contrast ,",
    "experiments in simple shear geometries exhibit strain localization even though the equilibrium stress is constant in space , indicating that some property of the internal state governs shear band formation .",
    "shear banding is caused by the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ rdq - chi ] ) between a configurational or structural parameter and the plastic rate of deformation .",
    "although the stress equilibrates quickly , the effective temperature dynamics continue to evolve over much longer timescales .",
    "materials that develop long - lived shear bands exhibit a very different macroscopic rheology compared to those that deform homogeneously  @xcite .",
    "the type of deformation has important implications for the macroscopic material and frictional properties  systems that localize also weaken rapidly .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : rdstab ] we study the stability of the model given by eqs .",
    "( [ dot - s ] ) and  ( [ dot - chi ] ) with respect to perturbations .",
    "we numerically integrate the stz equations to validate our analytic stability results in section  [ sec : rdnum_res ] and study the different types of deformation that persist for long times in section  [ sec : rdlocal_dyn ] .",
    "section  [ conclusionsrd ] concludes with a discussion of our results and open questions .",
    "we now study shear band formation for systems with a rate dependent steady state effective temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the fact that shear bands persist in the stz model is somewhat surprising , given that the only stationary state of eqs .",
    "( [ dot - s ] ) and  ( [ dot - chi ] ) is homogeneous deformation . in the following sections , we provide an explanation for shear band formation and evolution across a wide range of strain rates .",
    "we emphasize that all of the shear bands discussed below are transient phenomena  at very large strains the shear bands diffuse across the entire width of the material and deformation once again becomes homogeneous .",
    "however , because the internal dynamics of the configurational degrees of freedom can be very slow compared to the stress evolution timescale , shear bands persist for very long times .",
    "for example , the shear stress in numerical solutions to the stz equations generally appears to reach a steady state within a few percent strain but the effective temperature profile often remains inhomogenous for more than 20% strain .",
    "first , the evolution equations for @xmath34 and @xmath9 can be written as follows : @xmath35 where the @xmath36 operator indicates a derivative with respect to time in units of strain .",
    "the function @xmath37 depends implicitly on the stress and the effective temperature .",

    "we will use the term `` zero - mean perturbation '' to refer to a perturbing function with a vanishing @xmath42 component that does not change the average value of the underlying function across the width of the sample .    for a specified externally imposed strain rate @xmath43 , the steady state solution to eqs .",
    "[ s - dotrd ] and [ chi - dotrd ] is @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is given by the solution to the algebraic equation @xmath46 / \\overline{q}$ ] .",
    "the jacobian evaluated at this steady state is greatly simplified : @xmath47    the upper right entry ( @xmath48 ) vanishes for zero - mean perturbations , so jacobian is lower triangular , and the diagonal values alone specify stability .",
    "@xmath49 is strictly negative because @xmath50 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath9 , and therefore the system is linearly stable with respect to zero - mean perturbations from a homogeneous steady state if @xmath51 is negative , or equivalently , @xmath52 .",

    "materials with a steady state stress that increases as a function of driving rate are called rate strengthening .",
    "in contrast , several experiments that study friction of granular fault gouge find rate weakening behavior ; the steady state stress decreases as the imposed strain rate increases  @xcite",

    "we focus on shear banding in materials that are rate strengthening , but rate weakening materials are an interesting avenue of further research .    stz theory predicts that rate strengthening materials should continue to deform homogeneously once they attain steady state .",
    "however , for certain initial conditions simulated rate strengthening materials develop shear bands before they reach this homogeneous steady state .",

    "the model predicts that shear bands gradually broaden over large ( @xmath160 ) strains .    for a fixed initial effective temperature ,",
    "the stz model predicts that the shear bands become thinner and that their internal structure becomes more disordered as the strain rate increases .",
    "this is similar to the `` ductile to brittle '' transition seen in amorphous materials as a function of the strain rate  @xcite . at lower strain rates the material deforms",
    "nearly homogeneously and appears ductile , but at higher strain rates all the deformation is localized in a thin shear band or mode ii crack .    at very high strain rates and low initial effective temperatures , the effective temperature approaches infinity at the center of the band during the transient response and",
    "the system `` melts '' .",
    "the liquefied region is very thin and failure occurs near the maximum stress overshoot , which is consistent with material failure via shear banding seen at high strain rates in bulk metallic glasses .",
    "the model predicts that for materials that fail via this shear banding mechanism , the apparent shear band thickness should be at most the diffusion length scale @xmath20 . although @xmath20 has not been measured experimentally , a reasonable assumption is that it is on the order of an stz radius . in bulk metallic glasses",
    "this scale should be at most 30 atomic radii , on the order of 10 nm  @xcite , which is much smaller than the thermal diffusion length scale ( 100 - 240 nm  @xcite ) , and this could explain the shear band thickness measured in these materials . while the stz radius has not been estimated in granular fault gouge , this mechanism could provide an explanation for the scale of the prominent fracture surface , which is orders of magnitude smaller than other length scales in earthquake faults .",
    "we have also shown that these localization dynamics can not be captured by a single degree of freedom rate and state friction law , and that analyzing steady state model dynamics can often be misleading .",
    "this is because the structural degrees of freedom parametrized by @xmath95 evolve much more slowly than the stress dynamics , so that the microstructure continues to evolve although the stress appears to have reached a steady state .",
    "this insight is particularly important for materials that develop highly localized shear bands , as the friction law based on homogeneous dynamics is vastly different from one that accounts for transient shear band development .",
    "we suggest that localization may play a role in dynamic weakening seen at high shear speeds in granular materials , and that the stz pde model generates a useful friction law in this case .",
    "while this is an exciting starting point for studying deformation and failure for amorphous materials , many fundamental questions remain .",
    "we discuss a few of them below .",
    "+ _ what is @xmath17 for various amorphous materials ?",
    "_ throughout this paper , we have used a fit to data generated by haxton and liu  @xcite as the definition for @xmath17 .",
    "haxton and liu simulate a 2d amorphous packing of harmonically repulsive discs at thermal temperatures above and below the glass transition temperature , and used fdt to extract an effective temperature at each thermal temperature and strain rate .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the only such data set",
    ". it would be very interesting to use fdt to extract effective temperatures from simulations of other types of amorphous packings , such as the lennard jones glass studied by shi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , foams , amorphous silicon , or bulk metallic glasses .",
    "is @xmath17 similar for all of these materials ? is the effective glass transition temperature , @xmath30 , universal ?",
    "one possibility is that the transition from glassy behavior to simply activated behavior should occur when @xmath161 , ( i.e. , when the strain rate is the same as the internal rate @xmath162 ) .",
    "however , it is also possible that in complicated materials like bulk metallic glasses , the transition occurs at slower rates than @xmath162 , since the stzs in these systems are large , multi - component regions that likely evolve more slowly than the phonon frequency .",
    "are there other ways to measure @xmath17 , such as looking at the behavior of a tracer harmonic oscillator inside a simulation box ?",
    "is it possible to define the effective temperature by quantifying the change in configurational entropy as a function of the potential energy ?",
    "numerical results from ono , _ et al . _ suggest that this type of calculation is possible , but they were not able to sample enough low probability states to state conclusively that the fdt and entropic definitions generate the same effective temperature .",
    "these are important questions because it is very difficult to measure fluctuations in position or stress precisely enough in experiments to extract an effective temperature using fdt .",
    "+ _ what are the effects of geometry and boundary conditions ? _",
    "we have so far restricted ourselves to the simplest possible shear geometry and symmetric , no conduction boundary conditions on the effective temperature .",
    "the boundary conditions on the effective temperature help determine the location of shear bands within the material as well as the steady states of the system .",
    "in many experiments and in some earthquake faults , shear bands tend to localize along the boundary  @xcite .",
    "why does this occur ?",
    "different geometries can be modeled in stz theory by adjusting the boundary conditions on the effective temperature .",
    "for example , a crystalline solid boundary might impose a constant , more ordered boundary condition on the effective temperature , while a rough , jammed solid might do the opposite .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate the effects of these conditions on shear band evolution .",
    "in addition , many engineering materials are tested under tension and compression , or a `` notch '' is placed on the surface of the material . in these cases",
    "there is a free boundary which can deform , leading to a coupling between deformation and stress .",
    "the necking instability has been investigated using earlier stz models  @xcite  it would be interesting to repeat this analysis with our improved understanding of the coupling between structure and deformation .",
    "+ _ what is the connection between stick slip instabilities and shear banding ? _    in section  [ sec :",
    "rdstab ] , we showed that the steady - state stability of homogeneous flow was dependent on whether the material was rate strengthening or rate weakening  rate weakening materials were unstable with respect to shear bands .",
    "interestingly , in rate - and - state ( ode ) friction models , stick - slip instabilities can only occur when the system is rate weakening  @xcite .",
    "in addition , formation of a shear band coincides with what looks like a slip event in the macroscopic stress - strain curve .",
    "can a shear band be understood as the pde analogue of a slip event in a single degree of freedom ode ? is is possible for the transient shear bands seen in ostensibly rate strengthening materials to generate stick - slip like behavior ?",
    "preliminary numerical solutions suggest that the transient shear bands can not generate stick slip behavior , but more work is needed on this avenue of research .",
    "+ _ is the localized state weaker in absolute terms than the homogeneous state ? does this matter ?",
    "_ recently , researchers studying friction in fault gouge have found that the shear stress supported by the gouge weakens rapidly at high driving rates  @xcite .",
    "strain localization in the stz model generically leads to a rapid decrease in the shear stress , and has been suggested as a mechanism for this experimental observation  @xcite .",
    "however , in most numerical solutions to the stz equations ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : rdssdiff ] ) , the final stress state in the localized system is equal to or higher than the stress in the homogeneous system , except in the special case where the initial effective temperature perturbation is a step function  @xcite . in absolute terms ,",
    "the localized system is stronger ( or at least no weaker ) than the homogeneous system , which is counter - intuitive .",
    "there are several ways to reconcile this information with intuition .",
    "first , we note that the _ rate _ at which the localized system weakens is much more rapid than the homogeneous system . for dynamic phenomena , such as stick - slip instabilities and stop - start experiments ,",
    "the weakening rate and the total stress drop help determine the dynamic response .",
    "is the rapid weakening seen in systems that localize large enough to cause stick - slip ?",
    "another possibility is that many of these systems attain strain rates at which the stz solid - like description breaks down .",
    "although we do not explicitly model this here , it seems likely that the liquid - like material in the band possess a vastly reduced strength compared to the solid outside the band .",

    "the plastic rate of deformation tensor can be written in terms of dynamical variables from stz theory .",
    "we postulate that under shear stress , each stz deforms to accommodate a certain amount of shear strain , and can not deform further in the same direction .",
    "this is modeled by requiring that each stz be in one of two states : oriented along the principal stress axis in the direction of applied shear , which we will denote `` @xmath168 '' , or in the perpendicular direction , `` @xmath169 '' .    under applied strain",
    ", the stz will _ flip _ in the direction of strain , from `` @xmath169 '' to `` @xmath168 '' . under shear stress in the opposite direction",
    ", the stzs can revert to their original configurations , which corresponds to a flip from `` @xmath168 '' to `` @xmath169 '' .",
    "we assume that the stz density is small and each stz interacts with other stzs through continuum fields such as the stress .",
    "therefore the rearrangements or _ flips _ occur at a rate @xmath170 , which depends on the stress and a characteristic attempt frequency @xmath171 .",
    "because each stz can flip at most once in the direction of applied strain , stzs must be created and annihilated to sustain plastic flow .",
    "based on these considerations , the number density of stzs in each direction , @xmath164 , obeys the following differential equation @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the rate of switching per stz as a function of stress , @xmath174 is the rate at which energy is dissipated per stz , and @xmath175 is the steady state density of stzs in equilibrium .",
    "the plastic rate of deformation tensor is given by the rate at which stzs flip : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is a strain increment of order unity and @xmath178 is a density roughly equal to the inverse of the volume per particle .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ number_density ] ) correspond to stzs switching from `` @xmath168 '' to `` @xmath169 '' states and vice - versa , while the last term enforces detailed balance : stzs are created at a rate proportional to @xmath179 and annihilated at a rate proportional to their density .",
    "the creation rate is proportional to the probability of a configurational fluctuation that corresponds to an stz .",

    "@xcite and haxton and liu  @xcite show that a driven amorphous system possesses a well - defined steady state effective temperature , @xmath22 , at each value of the imposed strain rate . in these simulations ,",
    "a thermostat ensures homogeneous deformation within the glass and the particles are sheared for long periods of time before the steady state measurement is taken .    to model deformation in time varying systems , such as start - up flows",
    ", we have to estimate how the effective temperature changes in time .",
    "as detailed in  @xcite , we assume that the heat content in the configurational degrees of freedom is driven by two independent sources , mechanical work and thermal fluctuations .",
