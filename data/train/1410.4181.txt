    "it has been long known ( e.g. bernstein in 1912 ) that some type of boundary curvature condition ( which depends on @xmath6 ) must be satisfied in order to guarantee that a classical solution exists for each @xmath13 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "how important is the role of boundary smoothness in the conclusions reached in @xcite ?",
    "we shall show , by constructing suitable domains @xmath2 and dirichlet data @xmath29 that the existence of a `` nonconvex corner '' @xmath30 in @xmath21 can cause the unique generalized ( e.g. variational ) solution to be discontinuous at @xmath30 even if @xmath31 is smooth and the generalized mean curvature @xmath32 ( i.e. @xcite ) of @xmath21 at @xmath30 is @xmath33 ; this shows that some degree of smoothness of @xmath21 is required to obtain the conclusions in @xcite .",
    "we shall prove the following    [ main theorem ] let @xmath34 @xmath35 and assume there exists @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 then there exist a domain @xmath40 and a point @xmath41 such that    * @xmath42 is smooth ( @xmath43 ) , * there is a neighborhood @xmath44 of @xmath30 such that @xmath45 for @xmath46 where @xmath19 is the mean curvature of @xmath47 and * @xmath48 where @xmath32 is the generalized mean curvature of @xmath47    and there exists dirichlet boundary data @xmath49 such that the minimizer @xmath50 of @xmath51 exists and satisfies ( [ one - a ] ) , @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 in a neighborhood of @xmath30 in @xmath4    since there are certainly many examples of dirichlet problems which have continuous solutions even though their domains fail to satisfy appropriate smoothness or boundary curvature conditions ( e.g. by restricting to a smaller domain a classical solution of a dirichlet problem on a larger domain ) , the question of necessary or sufficient conditions for the continuity at @xmath30 of a generalized solution of a particular dirichlet problem is of interest and the examples here suggest ( to us ) that a `` concus - finn '' type condition might yield necessary conditions for the continuity at @xmath30 of solutions ; see  [ cfcondition ] .",
