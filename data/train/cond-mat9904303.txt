    "the question of whether short range edwards anderson ( ea ) spin glasses share the remarkable features of the infinite range sherrington kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite is still an open one . in this work",
    "we present monte carlo simulations of the @xmath0 ea ising spin glass @xcite with a bimodal distribution of the quenched couplings , performed on large lattice volumes ( thanks to the tempering and parallel tempering simulation technique @xcite ) , with a large number of samples , and down to low values of the temperature @xmath1 . in this way we are able to obtain detailed information about the nature of the transition , to determine with good precision critical temperature and exponents , and to give strong evidence supporting the fact that the low - temperature phase is mean - field - like .",
    "a great deal of effort has gone in ensuring reliability of the data on delicate issues such as thermalization checks and consistency of data analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first of all we describe the model and the parameters of our mc simulation .",
    "we then present data related to the binder cumulant and to the determination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . by analyzing the overlap susceptibility we determine the value of @xmath5 .",
    "finally we discuss in detail about the probability distribution of the overlap @xmath6 .",
    "we present , among others , evidence for non - triviality of single sample @xmath7 and for a non - zero value of the position of the maximum of @xmath6 , @xmath8 , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is very difficult to run reliable numerical simulation of finite dimensional spin glasses .",
    "the main reason for such difficulties is the presence of many meta - stable states ( responsible for aging effects as well as for many other peculiarities of spin glasses @xcite ) .",
    "the monte carlo dynamics gets easily trapped , and the system only probes a restricted part of phase space .",
    "many algorithmic solutions have been proposed to improve the speed of thermalization of these systems .",
    "all these techniques are related to density scaling methods ( see @xcite for a review and references ) : we use here the maybe simplest implementation of these ideas , the parallel tempering  @xcite , where a number of configurations of the system are allowed to exchange their temperature ( for multi - canonical methods , that are strongly related and have in principle an even wider range of applicability , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to parallel tempering we have been able to thermalize systems of volume @xmath2 down to @xmath9 .",
    "we study the @xmath0 edwards - anderson ising spin glass with binary couplings , with hamiltonian    @xmath10    where the sum runs over nearest neighboring sites , the @xmath11 are @xmath12 ising spins , and the couplings are quenched variables drawn with probability @xmath13 among the two values @xmath14 .",
    "the _ overlap _ among two different systems is defined as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote two configurations of the system in the same realization of the quenched disorder .",
    "the overlap probability distribution for a given sample is    @xmath18    where @xmath19 denotes the usual gibbs average .",
    "its average over samples is    @xmath20    and its moments are defined as    @xmath21    we always denote by @xmath22 the thermal averages and by @xmath23 the disorder averages .",
    "our simulation have been performed on a set of workstations , using a multi - spin - coding program that was inspired by the work of @xcite .",
    "we have selected the parameters of our monte carlo and parallel tempering runs such to guarantee a complete thermalization of the measured observables .",
    "we will discuss this issue in some detail .",
    "table ( [ t - parame ] ) summarizes the relevant parameters used in the simulation : we give among others the number of thermalization steps , of measurements steps , the number of different disorder realizations and the temperature ranges investigated by tempering .",
    "temperature values have been chosen uniformly spaced in the interval between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    ".parameters of the tempered monte carlo runs .",
    "[ t - parame ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have used different methods to verify that we have correctly thermalized the systems . using `` parallel tempering '' , one is actually performing a generalized markov chain where systems at different temperatures are allowed to `` move '' in temperature - space too . a necessary condition for the markov chain to be effective in de - correlating different measurements",
    "is the fact that each system spans at least a few times all the allowed temperature range during the simulation . in this respect",
    "we check _ a posteriori _ that the probability of swapping temperature has been of order @xmath26 ( ensuring in this way that a single system did not get stuck at a specific value of @xmath1 ) and that the histogram counting the time that each system has spent at each temperature is fairly flat .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled in all our simulations , for all @xmath1 and @xmath27 values .",
    "another very strong check of thermalization is the fact that the single sample @xmath7 are symmetric in the limits of the statistical significance of the histogram .",
    "this is very well verified as can be seen for example in figure [ fig : pjq ] where we plot @xmath7 for selected samples .",
    "we start by discussing the overlap binder parameter . we will use it to qualify the phase transition , and to determine the critical temperature and the first of the critical exponents , @xmath4 .",
    "we will use and describe different methods to compute the quantities we are interested in .",
    "our statistical sample of configurations is a large sample , and our set of data precise ( even as far as the dependence over the lattice volume @xmath28 is concerned ) : we will show that different analysis styles give compatible ( precise ) results .",
    "we define the usual overlap binder parameter as    @xmath29    the binder parameter is an adimensional quantity , and its value at the critical point is universal .",
    "close to @xmath3 its leading behavior is    @xmath30    in usual ferromagnetic systems the infinite volume limit of the magnetization binder cumulant is @xmath31 in the warm phase ( where the distribution of the order parameter is gaussian ) and @xmath32 in the broken phase : for a spin glass with replica symmetry breaking and hence a non - trivial distribution of the overlap order parameter , the transition is signaled by a non - trivial value of @xmath33 in the broken phase ( in the warm phase one expects an infinite volume limit of zero ) . in both cases",
    "the location of @xmath3 is signaled by the crossing of the curves of @xmath33 versus @xmath1 for different values of the lattice size @xmath27 ( asymptotically for large @xmath27 ) : large @xmath27 curves are lower for @xmath34 and higher for @xmath35 .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : binder_allsides ] @xmath33 versus @xmath1 for different @xmath27 values .",
    "the crossing point is close to @xmath36 for all lattice values , and the value of the binder cumulant at criticality , @xmath37 is close to @xmath38 .",
    "also error analysis has been a sensitive issues .",
    "we have always used a jackknife or a bootstrap error analysis @xcite _ directly _ on the fitted parameters to determine errors .",
    "still one has to keep in mind that statistical errors come together with systematic errors , due to the functional form one decides to try to fit ( typically the asymptotic scaling form , that on finite size lattices is affected by power corrections ) .",
    "the two types of errors have to be kept under control separately .     versus @xmath1 , for different values of the linear lattice size @xmath27 ( see caption in the plot).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in figure [ fig : binder_allsides ] the crossing of the different @xmath39 curves is very clear .",
    "it is interesting to stress the difference with the three dimensional case @xcite , where the crossing at @xmath3 looks more like a merging of the different curves .",
    "@xmath40 is ( very ) close to the lower critical dimension , while in @xmath41 we are in a safe region : potentially this is important to make the physical picture easier to understand .",
    "let us discuss a first naive approach to the data . by looking at the crossing of the curves",
    "@xmath42 versus @xmath1 for different @xmath43 values one sees that one can not extract a systematic dependence of the crossing point ( and hence of the estimate of the effective critical temperature @xmath44 ) over @xmath27 .",
    "any systematic trend is smaller than the statistical error ( maybe just showing a systematic average decrease of the estimate @xmath44 when going from smaller to larger @xmath27 values ) .",
    "the preferred value of @xmath3 is slightly larger than @xmath45 .",
    "a first naive estimate of @xmath4 can be done by linearizing @xmath42 around the estimate we have given for @xmath3 , and by evaluating the logarithm of the slope ratio ( divided by the logarithm of the two lattice sizes ratio , @xmath46 . with this method",
    ", one gets a first estimate for a set of effective exponents @xmath47 . here too , one can not distinguish any clear strong dependence over the lattice size : the error one gets on @xmath4 is completely correlated to the variation of the estimate of @xmath3 . for larger",
    "@xmath3 one estimates a lower value of @xmath4 , while for lower estimates of @xmath3 one gets larger estimates for @xmath4 .",
    "the error is dominated by this effect .",
    "the estimate for @xmath4 is close to @xmath32 .    to get a reliable estimate of @xmath3 and of @xmath4 we have used two methods of analysis of @xmath33",
    "( see for example the discussion of the analysis of reference @xcite ) . in the first approach we linearize the data close to @xmath3 ( for all @xmath27 values ) and we run a global fit to all data",
    ": we fit @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the two variable function @xmath42 ( as we said , linearized close to @xmath3 ) .",
    "we use data in a @xmath1 range around the interval @xmath48 .",
    "we estimate the errors over the fit parameters ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) by a jackknife approach  @xcite : we repeat the fit approximately @xmath49 times over a subsample of the data containing all of our statistical sample but a fraction @xmath50 .",
    "the error is estimated by looking at fluctuations of the results of the @xmath49 fits , and by accounting for the fact they are correlated @xcite .",
    "we also repeat the fits by discarding the smaller @xmath27 values , to check if we can observe any systematic drift ( again with good accuracy the average value of the result does not seem to depend systematically over the @xmath27 range selected ) .",
    "results are very stable , and the value we estimate for @xmath4 systematically comes out to be close to @xmath51 .    in the second approach , that comes in different flavors , one only uses data in the warm phase .",
    "this method leads to a smaller statistical error , that is balanced from a larger systematic incertitude ( since we only select data at a given distance from @xmath3 , and approaching @xmath3 leads to a systematic drift of the estimate ) . in this case",
    "we start by selecting a threshold value for @xmath33 , @xmath52 .",
    "we start with low values of @xmath53 , and we approach @xmath37 from below : we can not get too close to @xmath37 or the merging of the curves for different sizes makes the error over the measurement too large ( we use values of @xmath53 going from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "we use a polynomial fit to interpolate the data for @xmath56 , at different @xmath27 values .",
    "we have decided to use a polynomial of degrees four ( we have checked it guarantees stable fits and consistent results ) , and we fit a @xmath1 range in the critical region ( for @xmath57 we use the data in the @xmath1 range @xmath58 , for @xmath59 we use the range @xmath60 ) .",
    "we define now @xmath61 as the crossing point of the fitted polynomial with the horizontal line at @xmath53 , and @xmath62 as    @xmath63    when @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath53 is too small violations of scaling are dominant , while if one approaches too much @xmath37 the merging of the @xmath33 curves makes the error over the determination of @xmath62 overwhelming .",
    "the errors have been estimated by using a _ bootstrap _ approach ( very similar in spirit to the jackknife technique , see @xcite ) : one emulates fake sets of data with a gaussian distribution around the real measurements , fits these multiple sets of fake data and compute the errors over the fit parameter .",
    "we note at last that we have also used a variation of this second method , described in @xcite , based on the direct analysis of the derivative of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "also this method gives results that are compatible with the other ones .",
