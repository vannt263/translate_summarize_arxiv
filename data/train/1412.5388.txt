    "the @xmath3 ( from now onwards simply @xmath8 ) was reported a decade ago by the belle collaboration in the reaction @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "after this finding , different collaborations @xcite confirmed this state and very recently the spin - parity quantum numbers of @xmath8 have been confirmed to be @xmath10  @xcite .    during this time , several theoretical models have been proposed to describe the properties of this state , considering it as a charmonium state , a tetraquark , a @xmath11 hadron molecule and a mixture between a charmonium and a molecular component  @xcite . in spite of the effort of these numerous groups ,",
    "the properties of this particle are not yet well understood and represent a challenge both for theorists and experimentalists .    in a different frontier of physics ,",
    "collaborations like rhic and lhc have devoted a significant effort to study the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it is now a well accepted fact that in high energy heavy ion collisions a deconfined medium is created : the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "the formation of the quark gluon plasma phase increases the number of produced @xmath8 s and the predicted abundance is very sensitive to the structure of @xmath8 ( tetraquark , molecular , etc . )",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    ", heavy ion collisions can be used to obtain information about exotic charmonium states as @xmath8 .",
    "however , due to the rich hadronic environment present in the plasma , the @xmath8 can be destroyed / produced in collisions with ordinary hadrons , fact which can affect to its abundance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hadronic absorption cross section of the @xmath8 by mesons like @xmath12 and @xmath13 was evaluated for the processes @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath15 . using these cross sections , the variation of the @xmath8 meson abundance during the expansion of the hadronic matter",
    "was computed with the help of a kinetic equation with gain and loss terms .",
    "the results turned out to be strongly dependent on the quantum numbers of the @xmath8 and on its structure .",
    "the present work is devoted to introduce two improvements in the calculation of cross sections performed in ref .",
    "the first and most important one is the inclusion of the anomalous vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which were neglected before . with these vertices new reaction channels",
    "become possible , such as @xmath20 , and the inverse process @xmath21 .",
    "the second improvement is the inclusion of the charged components of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons which couple to the @xmath8  @xcite .",
