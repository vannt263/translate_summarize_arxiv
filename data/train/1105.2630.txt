    "penrose singularity theorem states that if in addition to the dominant energy condition , the space - time has a trapped surface , then the space - time contains _",
    "singularities_. the _ weak cosmic censorship _ conjecture asserts that under reasonable physical assumptions , singularities should be hidden from an observer at infinity by the event horizon of a black hole .",
    "thus , by combining these two claims , to predict the existence of black holes , it suffices to exhibit one trapped surface in a space - time , . in other words , although many supplementary conditions are required , we regard the existence of a trapped surface as the presence of a black hole .",
    "a major challenge in general relativity is to understand how trapped surfaces actually form due to the focusing of gravitational waves . in a recent breakthrough @xcite ,",
    "demetrios christodoulou gave an answer to this long standing problem .",
    "he discovered a mechanism which is responsible for the dynamical formation of trapped surfaces in vacuum space - times . in the monograph @xcite , in addition to the minkowskian flat data on a incoming null hypersurface , christodoulou identified an open set of initial data ( this is the _ short pulse _ ansatz ) on a outgoing null hypersurfaces .",
    "based on the techniques developed by himself and klainerman in the proof of the global stability of the minkowski space - times @xcite , he managed to understand the whole picture of how various geometric quantities interact along the evolution .",
    "once the estimates on curvatures are established in a large region of the space - time , the actual formation of trapped surfaces is easy to demonstrate .",
    "christodoulou also proved a version of the same result for the short pulse data prescribed on past null infinity .",
    "this miraculous work provides the first global _ large data _ result in general relativity ( without symmetry assumptions ) and opens the gate for many new developments on dynamical problems related to black holes .    in @xcite , klainerman and rodnianski extended aforementioned result of christodoulou .",
    "they significantly simplified the proof of christodoulou ( from about six hundred pages to one hundred and twenty ) .",
    "they also enlarged the admissible set of initial conditions and show that the corresponding propagation estimates of connection coefficients and curvatures are much easier to derive .",
    "the relaxation of the propagation estimates are just enough to guarantee that a trapped surface still forms .",
    "based on the trace estimates developed in a sequence of work of the authors towards the critical local well - posedness for einstein vacuum equations , they reduced the number of derivatives needed of christodoulou in the argument from two derivatives of the curvature ( in christodoulou s proof ) to just one .",
    "more importantly , klainerman and rodnianski introduced a parabolic scaling in @xcite which is incorporated into lebesgue norms and sobolev norms .",
    "these new techniques allow them to capture the hidden _ smallness _ of the nonlinear interactions among different small or large components of various geometric objects .",
    "the result of klainerman and rodnianski can be easily localized with respect to angular sectors , has the potential for further developments , see @xcite .",
    "we remark that klainerman and rodnianski only concentrated on the problem on a finite region .",
    "the question from past null infinity can be solved in a similar manner as in @xcite once one understand the picture on a finite region .",
    "the problem from past null infinity has been studied in a recent work by reiterer and trubowitz , @xcite .",
    "one common feature of the proofs in @xcite and @xcite is that , in order to derive energy estimates on one or higher derivatives of curvature components , they all constructed three _ angular momentum vector fields _",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 which essentially captured almost rotational symmetry of the space - time .",
    "as far as the author aware , the main reason of using @xmath3 s is that the energy estimates on @xmath4 behave well because one can take advantage of cancelations from the pseudo - symmetry of @xmath3 s . here",
    ", the @xmath5 is the _ modified lie derivative _ defined in @xcite and @xmath6 is the curvature of the space - time .",
    "we can observe this advantage in the proof of stability of minknowski space - time @xcite where @xmath4 yields better decay estimates .",
    "there is one obvious defect of the modified lie derivative . as usual lie derivatives ,",
    "the @xmath5 is _ not _ tensorial in @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , it evolves one derivative of @xmath3 . in other words , if we use modified lie derivatives , we may lose immediately one derivative .",
    "we have two remedies to this loss of derivatives : in @xcite , one relies on higher order derivative estimates ; in @xcite , one makes use of more subtle trace estimates .",
    "the above discussion can be summarized as follows : roughly speaking , a good estimate on lie derivatives relies on the almost symmetries @xmath3 s , but lie derivatives causes a loss of derivative as we just explained .",
    "hence , to avoid this loss , we shall give up the use of the pseudo - symmetries .",
    "in this paper , we propose an approach to derive energy estimates on curvatures without constructing rotational vector fields at all .",
    "in particular , in stead of using modified lie derivatives , we work with covariant derivatives to save one derivative .",
    "of course , we have to pay a a price of controlling much more error terms .",
    "nevertheless , this significantly simplifies the proofs compared to either @xcite or @xcite . in particular , compared to @xcite , we use only one derivative in curvature ; compared to @xcite , instead of using trace inequality , all the estimates are derived from the classical sobolev inequalities .",
    "we also want to mention that in the thesis of l. bieri , see @xcite , based on a more general asymptotic assumptions , she gave a simplified proof of the stability of minkowski space - time .",
    "she managed to derive decay from the time vector field and the conformal scaling of the space - time which allowed her to circumvent rotational vector fields in that situation .",
    "but the current situation is different from @xcite : we do not use lie derivatives at all and the lower regularity forces us to explore more structures from the einstein equations .",
    "the main observation arises from the second bianchi identities . roughly speaking ,",
    "they explicitly show how one expresses angular or rotational derivatives of curvature components @xmath7 in terms of some null derivatives of curvature components plus lower order non - linear terms .",
    "namely , they can be written schematically as @xmath8 or @xmath9 where we use lower order terms @xmath10 to collect all nonlinear interactions and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are two standard null directions under the framework of double null foliations .",
    "thus , up to lower order corrections , to obtain the estimates on @xmath7 rotational derivatives on curvatures , it suffices to control @xmath13 or @xmath14 null derivatives of curvatures .",
    "thus , we identify our main targets to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 and we shall derive energy estimates for them .    according the above idea , we use the modified short pulse ansatz proposed klainerman and rodnianski in @xcite .",
    "we remark that this ansatz allows more large components than the original short pulse data discovered by christodoulou in @xcite .",
    "we shall derive the energy estimates based on bel - robinson tensors associated to @xmath17 and @xmath18 . to deal with error terms , namely terms @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the proof in following sections",
    ", we have to take account of the special structure of those terms . in reality , some generic terms in error term may cause a loss of @xmath22 which prevent us from closing the bootstrap argument . to avoid this loss , there are typically three techniques to use :    1 .",
    "we bound a product of two term in @xmath23 by two @xmath24 estimates on each term instead of one @xmath25 estimate on one of them and one @xmath23 estimate on the other . in most of the situation",
    ", this trick saves a @xmath26 .",
    "2 .   when we integrate a product of terms on some null hypersurface or on a domain in the space - time , we use integration by parts to move a bad derivative , typically @xmath27 or @xmath28 , from one term ( for whom this bad derivative may cause a loss of @xmath22 ) to another ( for whom this bad derivative is not bad at all , namely , there is no loss in @xmath29 ) . combined with bianchi identities ,",
    "this procedure may save a @xmath30 .",
    "3 .   for some generic term in error estimates mentioned above , though it appears that it causes a loss of @xmath29 ( which can not be retrieved by using the trick 1 ) and 2 ) ) , we can use in fact either signature considerations or a precise computations to show that this term does not show up at all in the error estimates .",
    "this manifests the special cancelations in the error terms .",
    "the whole proof is to combine these three tricks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in next section , we recall basic definitions and estimates from @xcite and we state the main theorem ; in following sections , we derive energy estimates for derivatives of curvature components in the following order : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and then @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",

    ", we have @xmath601    to estimate @xmath602 , we observe that in its integrand @xmath603 , we have @xmath604 .",
    "otherwise the total signature is less than @xmath69 .",
    "this allow @xmath605 to have @xmath24 estimates ( while @xmath136 does not , see @xcite ) .",
    "we can proceed exactly ( much easier in reality ) as we did for @xmath606 to show that @xmath607 .",
    "combined with the estimates for @xmath419 , we derive @xmath608      we claim @xmath400 .",
    "the integrand of @xmath609 may have the following three types of terms @xmath610 since the total signature is either 2 or 3 , this rules out the first two cases immediately . to rule out the third one ,",
    "notice that its appearance is originally through the following term @xmath611^{\\mu\\nu}{}_{n_1 n_2}\\ ] ] here , @xmath326 and @xmath327 are null .",
    "once again , direct computations show that @xmath612 never appears in @xmath613 .",
    "the integrand of @xmath20 can be written schematically as @xmath615 with total signature @xmath567 or @xmath295 .",
    "we split @xmath20 into @xmath462 where @xmath463 denotes the collection of terms with exactly @xmath338 anomalous curvature components .",
    "the integrand of @xmath466 must be one of the following forms @xmath616 thus , those terms can be dealt with exactly as we have done for @xmath401 is last subsection ( of the current section ) .",
    "thus , modulo the terms which will be removed eventually by gronwall s inequality , we derive @xmath617      according to the position of the anomaly , we split @xmath469 into @xmath618 where the corresponding integrands for @xmath471 , @xmath473 and @xmath619 are @xmath620 respectively .",
    "we use subindex @xmath621 to denote the anomaly ( b for bad ) .    to estimate @xmath471 ,",
    "since the total signature is at most @xmath295 , thus the signature of @xmath622 is at most @xmath66 . using bianchi equations , up to an error of size @xmath270",
    ", we can replace the curvature term @xmath623 by @xmath485 and we aslo replace the mild @xmath259 anomaly by @xmath111 .",
    "now we only consider the worst scenario .",
    "it should contain @xmath317 . in this case , according to signature considerations , @xmath624 .",
    "hence we control the worst scenario for @xmath471 as follows , @xmath625    to estimate @xmath473 , recall that the integrand is originally from ( modulo the hodge dual part ) @xmath626 it has to be @xmath627 if @xmath628 , we know @xmath629 .",
    "we also notice @xmath630 , otherwise @xmath469 contains a double anomaly in curvature components .",
    "hence , neither @xmath225 or @xmath317 appears as connection coefficients .",
    "furthermore , @xmath226 is also absent .",
    "thus , @xmath473 is essentially @xmath602 in last subsection ( of the current section ) .",
    "hence , @xmath631    to estimate @xmath619 , we need to carefully analyze the structure of @xmath626 as we pointed out at the beginning of the section , the possible anomalies for last term are @xmath276 , @xmath277 , @xmath259 and @xmath278 .",
    "first of all , @xmath276 can not occur since @xmath632 .",
    "thus , we have three cases left to deal with .      if @xmath637 or @xmath278 , those anomalies are mild hence can be replaced by @xmath111 . combined with bianchi equations if necessary , up to an error of size @xmath270 , the corresponding integrand looks like @xmath638 those terms have been treated in @xmath471 . thus , we can derive estimates for @xmath619 .",
    "combined with @xmath471 and @xmath473 , we have @xmath639      in this case , both the curvature components in the integrand @xmath626 are anomalous .",
    "according to the different anomalies of @xmath640 , we decompose @xmath641 into @xmath642 for @xmath643 , @xmath644 ; for @xmath645 , @xmath646 .",

    "the proof is routine .",
    "thus , up to an error of size @xmath270 , @xmath660 the last two integrals are bounded by @xmath254 .",
    "in fact , we can replace the mild anomaly @xmath240 by @xmath111 .",
    "then the proof becomes routine .",
    "we now move on to the most dangerous term in @xmath658 , @xmath661 it contains @xmath135 which does not have @xmath456 estimates .",
    "we can only rely on its @xmath662 estimates .",
    "it requires an extra integration by parts .",
    "up to an error of size @xmath270 , we use to derive @xmath663 the second integral is bounded by @xmath270 , because we can put @xmath23 on @xmath135 and @xmath24 on curvature components .",

    "this yields the bound for @xmath658 .",
    "together with @xmath649 and @xmath655 , we derive @xmath665    we now estimate @xmath645 .",
    "its integrand is in the following form @xmath627 since @xmath666 and @xmath667 is an anomaly , the integrand of @xmath645 is reduced to the following form @xmath668 we further decompose @xmath645 into @xmath669 such that the corresponding integrands of @xmath670 and @xmath671 are @xmath672 respectively .    for @xmath670 , up to an error term of size @xmath270 , we replace @xmath673 by @xmath674 to derive @xmath675 for @xmath676 , @xmath677 the last two integrals are bounded by @xmath270 .",
    "the proof is routine .",

    "@xmath682 in view of proposition [ pricise on chi chib ] , @xmath683 thus , in view of lemma [ l4 alpha precise ] we have @xmath684 thus , yields the estimates on @xmath680 .",
    "combined with @xmath676 , we have @xmath685    the last mission we need to complete is to show that @xmath671 vanishes .",
    "in fact , the expression of the integrand @xmath686 is not sufficient to show @xmath671 vanishes .",
    "and we can not control it .",
    "in view of the formula , we have to also investigate the part from the hodge dual to see the cancelation .",
    "we now show that @xmath687      we also have @xmath692 , @xmath693 and @xmath694 .",
