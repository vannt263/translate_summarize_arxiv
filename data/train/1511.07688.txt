    "heavy quark production in hard collisions is considered as a clean test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ( for a review see , e.g. , ref @xcite ) .",
    "this process provides not only many tests of perturbative qcd , but also some of the most important backgrounds to new physics processes , which have motivated the development of an extensive phenomenology at desy - hera , tevatron and lhc .",
    "furthermore , heavy quark production also is considered a good testing ground for diffractive physics and for the nature of the pomeron ( @xmath1 ) , which is a long - standing puzzle in the particle physics @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the pomeron is assumed to have a partonic structure , as proposed by ingelman and schlein @xcite many years ago , the production of heavy quarks in diffractive processes , is a direct probe of the quark and gluon content in the pomeron @xcite .    at high energies , the heavy quark production in hadronic collisions",
    "is dominated by gluon ",
    "gluon interactions , represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] ( a ) , with the dissociation of the incident hadrons .",
    "however , a heavy quark pair also can be generated in photon ",
    "gluon [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] ( b ) ] , photon  photon [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] ( c ) ] , pomeron  gluon [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] ( d ) ] , pomeron  pomeron [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] ( e ) ] and pomeron  photon [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] ( f ) ] interactions .",
    "these processes can be classified by the topology of the final state , with the presence of one or two empty regions in pseudo - rapidity , called rapidity gaps , separating the intact very forward hadron from the central massive object .",
    "taking into account that the photon and the pomeron are color singlet objects , we have that the processes ( b ) and ( d ) are characterized by one rapidity gap in the final state , while the processes ( c ) , ( e ) and ( f ) are characterized by two .",
    "moreover , the process ( c ) is a typical example of a exclusive process , where nothing else is produced except the leading hadrons and the central object .",
    "in contrast , if we assume that the pomeron has a partonic structure , we have that in the processes ( e ) and ( f ) , soft particles , associated to the remnants of the pomeron , are created accompanying the production of a hard diffractive object .",
    "the photon and pomeron  induced processes are expected to generate emerging protons with different transverse momentum distributions , with those associated to pomeron  induced having larger transverse momentum .",
    "consequently , in principle it is possible to introduce a selection criteria to separate these two processes . in the last years",
    ", these different processes have been studied separately by several authors @xcite , considering different approximations and assumptions , which difficult the direct comparison between its predictions . in particular , the feasibility of the experimental separation between the different contributions for the heavy quark production in photon and pomeron induced interactions at the lhc still is an open question , mainly during the run ii due to the large pile up expected at large luminosities .    in order to obtain realistic predictions for the heavy quark production in photon and",
    "pomeron induced interactions and to be able to include in the calculations the experimental cuts , the treatment of these processes in a monte carlo simulation is fundamental .",
    "some years ago , the forward physics monte carlo ( fpmc ) was proposed @xcite in order to simulate the central particle production with one or two leading protons and some hard scale in the event . in its original version , the pomeron ",
    "gluon , pomeron  pomeron and photon  photon interactions in hadronic collisions were implemented considering the elementary partonic processes as given in herwig .",
    "recently , we have generalized this monte carlo in order to include photon ",
    "gluon and photon  pomeron interactions , which allows to estimate the contribution of the different processes presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] in a common framework . in this paper",
    "we will present our results for the bottom production at the lhc . in particular",
    ", we will perform a comprehensive analysis of the transverse momentum and pseudo  rapidity distributions for the different processes .",
    "it is important to emphasize that similar studies can be performed using the fpmc for other hard processes at the lhc and/or future colliders .",
    "the content of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the formalism for the heavy quark production in photon and pomeron  induced interactions in hadronic collisions . in section [ results ] we present our predictions for the pseudo  rapidity and transverse momentum distributions as well as for the total cross sections for the bottom production in inclusive @xmath2 collisions and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main conclusions .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ tab1 ] we present our predictions for the total cross sections considering the inclusive @xmath2 collisions and the photon and pomeron - induced interactions .",
    "if we consider the full lhc kinematical range , denoted lhc in the table , one observes a reduction of one order of magnitude when going from the inclusive to single diffractive , and from single to double diffractive .",
    "however , as verified in table  [ tab1 ] , the photon and pomeron induced cross sections are still sizeable and could be measured at the lhc .",
    "a similar conclusion is valid by the analysis of our predictions for the bottom production in the the kinematical range of the lhcb detector , denoted by lhcb in the table .",
    "finally , in the line denoted lhc gap , we present our predictions for the cross sections when we require the presence of a rapidity gap in the detector acceptance of the lhcb detector , as discussed in the previous paragraph . in this case , after selection of diffractive events in the lhcb detector , we find a strong suppression of the inclusive processes and the single diffractive events become dominant . basically , we obtain that a small number of inclusive events are produced with a rapidity gap in the kinematical range of the lhcb detector , which are a background for genuine diffractive events . assuming the trigger efficiency for b - hadrons at lhcb is @xmath8 and the fraction of data with only one primary vertex is of about @xmath9  @xcite , the number of @xmath3 events in run i ( @xmath10 ) is predicted to be @xmath11 with almost no background . for higher @xmath12 bottom quarks , b - jets may also be used with similar efficiencies  @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that studies of this process using the run i data is feasible for several b - hadron decay channels and high-@xmath13 b - jets .",
    "as a summary , in this paper we have presented a detailed analysis for the bottom production in @xmath2 collisions at the lhc . in particular , the comparison between the predictions for the photon and pomeron - induced interactions was presented considering a common framework implemented in the forward physics monte carlo .",
    "we have generalized this monte carlo for photon - induced processes and performed a detailed comparison between the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 predictions for the bottom production in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath14 tev . for the pomeron - induced processes",
    ", we have considered the framework of the resolved pomeron model corrected for absorption effects , as used in the estimation of several other diffractive processes .",
    "our results indicate that the single and double diffractive processes are dominant if the outgoing protons can be tagged in the final state . on the other hand ,",
    "if only one proton is tagged , the contribution of the photon - induced processes can not be disregarded . finally , we have analysed the possibility of study of the diffractive processes considering the experimental data obtained in the run i and demonstrated that this study is feasible using the detector acceptance of the lhcb detector . such experimental analysis would help to constrain the underlying model for the pomeron and the absorption corrections , which are important open questions in particle physics .",
