    "for many years , the scientific community has shown great interest in the fracture of composites materials under imposed external stresses @xcite . by now several aspects of this process",
    "are well understood but a definite and complete physical description has not been made yet .",
    "furthermore , the huge technological impact of composites materials has led to a continuous development of new models and theoretical approaches @xcite . in fracture mechanics ,",
    "the average mechanical properties of the specimen are commonly considered to be the input data for material modeling .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , heterogeneous materials , such as fiber - reinforced composites , present widely distributed local mechanical properties .",
    "thus , analytical approaches are very limited and numerical simulations have become an indispensable tool in this field . on the other hand ,",
    "the latest developments in statistical mechanics have led to a deeper understanding of breakdown phenomena in heterogeneous systems @xcite .",
    "fiber reinforced composite materials exhibit a large variability of ultimate macrosopic properties .",
    "heterogeneity and anisotropy , in the micro- meso- and macro - structure of the composite , result in a complex scenario of damage mechanisms .",
    "basically , the damage mechanisms include fiber breakage , matrix cracking and yielding , fiber - matrix debonding and delamination @xcite . in this framework",
    ", the simulation of the composite behavior may be achieved by the statistical modeling of the micro - structure and the development of the relation between micro - structure and macro - behavior @xcite .    until now",
    "the modeling of the fracture of laminar composites has been based on finite element calculations @xmath4 and some micro - mechanical models @xcite .",
    "this modeling , has clarified that under pure shear loading the overall response of the sample is controlled mainly by the resin response .",
    "in fact , the scientific community recognizes that @xmath4 techniques provide an excellent tool for predicting composite performance in controlled loading conditions .",
    "however , the continuous nature of @xmath4 models usually makes them unable to describe the local damage evolution ; which is the primary micromechanical process .",
    "therefore , a local approach is mandatory for fully understanding this complicated process , from physics viewpoint .    during the last two decades",
    "monte carlo simulations have been used to numerically study stress redistribution in @xmath5 and @xmath6 for different fiber arrangements @xcite . as a results , several aspects of composite fracture , when the external load is parallel to the direction of the fibers , have been clarified",
    ". nevertheless , the fracture process and damage evolution of anisotropic systems , such as laminar composite materials subjected to shear external stress , are far from being well understood .    a very useful approach to the fracture problem are the well - known fiber bundle models ( fbm ) , introduced long time ago by daniels @xcite and coleman @xcite and subjects of intense research during the last years @xcite .",
    "fbms are constructed so that a set of fibers is arranged in parallel , with each one having a statistically distributed strength .",
    "the specimen is loaded parallel to the fiber direction and the fibers break if the load acting on them exceeds their threshold value .",
    "once the fibers begin to fail , several load transfer rules can be chosen .",
    "the complex evolution of internal damage and its associated stress redistribution are the most important factors to take into account in the accurate prediction of material strengths .",
    "the simplest case is to assume global load sharing @xmath7 , which means that after each fiber failure , its load is equally redistributed among all the intact fibers remaining in the set .",
    "otherwise , in local load sharing @xmath8 the overload is only transferred to the nearest neighbors .",
    "this case represents short range interactions among the fibers .",
    "however , in actual heterogeneous materials stress redistribution should fall somewhere between @xmath8 and @xmath7 .    in this paper , a generalized discrete model , where the interaction among elements is described by an anisotropic stress - transfer function ,",
    "is introduced . by varying the anisotropy strength and the effective range of interaction we interpolate between several limiting cases of load sharing .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section [ themodel ] the model and the way in which simulations are carried out are explained in detail .",
    "numerical results are presented and discussed in section [ section3 ] .",
    "the conclusions are given in the final section .",
    "the fracture of fiber - reinforced composites is characterized by a highly localized concentration of stresses at initial cracks .",
    "anisotropic laminar reinforcement prevents the nucleation of small cracks and the propagation of damage . in this way",
    ", the final collapse of small cracks in a critical cluster is avoided , retarding sample failure .    in materials",
    "science , the weibull distribution @xcite has proved to be a good empirical statistical distribution for representing sample strengths , @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the so - called weibull index , which controls the degree of threshold disorder in the system ( the bigger the weibull index , the narrower the range of threshold values ) , and @xmath11 is a reference load which acts as unity . on the other hand , in continuous homogeneous materials , the load profiles around a local damage area can be well fitted by a power law , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the stress increase on a material element at a distance @xmath14 from the crack tip .",
    "the above general relation covers the cases of global and local load sharing , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the transition from these limiting cases has been successfully described in isotropic systems @xcite . in global load sharing approach ,",
    "the strength of the sample can be computed analytically as @xmath17 for a weibull distribution and @xmath18 for a uniform distribution @xmath19 , of breaking thresholds .",
    "starting from these results @xcite a discrete model with anisotropic load sharing is introduced . in the model , it is assumed a two - dimensional square - lattice of @xmath20 elements , each one having a strength taken from a given cumulative distribution @xmath21 and identified by an integer @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "thus , to each element @xmath22 , a random threshold value @xmath24 is assigned .",
    "the system is driven by quasi - statically increasing the load on each element .",
    "the element @xmath22 breaks when its stress @xmath25 is equal to its threshold value @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the minimum value of @xmath26 in the set @xmath27 of all unbroken elements , @xmath28\\ ] ] defines the load increment @xmath29 .",
    "the quasi - statically load increasing is then performed by adding the amount of load @xmath29 to all the intact elements in the system . following this approach ,",
    "all intact elements have a nonzero probability of being affected by the ongoing failure event , and the additional load received by an intact element @xmath22 depends on its @xmath30 and @xmath31 from the element @xmath32 which has just been broken .",
    "furthermore , an anisotropic interaction is assumed between elements such that the load received by an element @xmath32 , due to the failure of @xmath22 , follows the relation : @xmath33 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are their relative distances on the @xmath34-axis and @xmath35-axis , respectively . @xmath1 and @xmath0 are adjustable parameters and the value @xmath36 is always given by the normalization condition , @xmath37 the sum runs over the set @xmath27 of all unbroken elements .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions , which means the largest value of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the linear size of the system .",
    "we note here that the assumption of periodic boundary conditions is for simplicity . in principle",
    ", an ewald summation procedure would be more accurate . in eq.([eq5 ] ) the extreme cases @xmath40 and @xmath41 also correspond to global load sharing and local load sharing , respectively .",
    "strictly speaking , for all @xmath0 , the range of interaction covers the whole lattice . when changing the anisotropy factor @xmath0 , one moves from a completely anisotropic case ( either @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) to the isotropic load redistribution ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "following this approach , a failing element transfers its load to the surviving elements of the set .",
    "this may provoke secondary fractures in the system which in turn induce tertiary ruptures and so on until the system fails or reaches an equilibrium state where the load on the intact elements is lower than their individual strength . in this latter case ,",
    "the external force is increased again and the process is repeated until the material macroscopically fails .",
    "the size of an avalanche @xmath45 is defined as the number of broken elements between two successive external drivings .",
    "hence , during an avalanche of failure events , an intact element @xmath22 receives the excess load from failing elements @xmath32 at each time step .",
    "consequently , its load increases by an amount , @xmath46 where the sum runs over the set @xmath47 of elements that have failed at time step @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 is the total load element @xmath22 receives during an avalanche initiated at @xmath50 and finished at @xmath51 . in this way ,",
    "when an avalanche ends , the external load is increased again and another avalanche is initiated .",
    "the process is repeated until no intact elements remain in the system and the ultimate strength of the material @xmath52 , is defined as the maximum load the system can support before its complete breakdown .",
    "the mechanical properties of the bundle and the statistics of internal damage events were studied numerically by varying the anisotropy strength ( @xmath0 ) and the range of interaction ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "large scale numerical simulations in @xmath5 were executed .",
    "several system sizes @xmath53 were considered and simulations were performed over at least five different realizations for the biggest system @xmath54 and five thousand for the smallest one @xmath55 .",
    "we recorded the avalanche size distribution @xmath56 , and the ultimate strength of the samples @xmath57 , which is always normalized by the characteristic value @xmath58 of the cumulative threshold distribution @xmath59 .",
    "it is important to remark , that by using an isotropic power law stress redistribution @xmath60 , a crossover point was observed @xcite .",
    "hence , two distinct regions were distinguished , over the domain of @xmath1 . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath57 is independent on @xmath39 , which corresponds to the gls behavior .",
    "however , when the effective range of interaction is decreased @xmath61 , the limiting case of local load sharing is approached and the strength of the system should vanish in the @xmath62 limit @xcite . in the isotropic case , @xmath63 falls in the vicinity of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "figures [ figure1]a . and",
    "[ figure1]b show the critical stress values @xmath57 obtained for several ranges of interactions @xmath1 and anisotropy strengths @xmath0 .",
    "the data corresponds to systems with @xmath64 elements and a weibull distribution of breaking thresholds with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "two distinct regions can be easily identified in the graph [ figure1]a . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "the critical strength @xmath57 is independent , within statistical errors , of both the effective range of interaction @xmath1 and the anisotropy strength @xmath0 .",
    "as we have already pointed out , this behavior is expected for the standard @xmath7 scheme . however , when the effective range of interaction decreases or the anisotropy strength increases , we found non - trivial dependencies . in figure  [ figure1]b ,",
    "the critical stress of a system with strong anisotropy ( @xmath67 ) is detailed .",
    "we illustrate the model s behavior for several system sizes from @xmath55 to @xmath68 . for small @xmath1 , @xmath57 is independent of both effective range of interaction and system size .",
    "however , as soon as the localized nature of the interaction becomes dominant , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath69 , @xmath57 vanishes logarithmically with increasing system size .",
    "this qualifies for a genuine short - range behavior as found in local load sharing models , where the strength of the sample must vanish in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . in summary , in the regime @xmath70 ,",
    "all the numerical findings are in excellent agreement with the mean field analytical prediction .",
    "besides , figure [ figure1]a suggests that the crossover point @xmath71 would differ from what was found using the isotropic stress transfer function @xcite only for a very high anisotropy strength , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath72 .",
    "nevertheless , a priori one would expect the system size dependence to be more pronounced onces the anisotropy in introduced .",
    "figure [ figure1]b shows that in the transition region the system size dependence is more appreciable than for the isotropic case @xcite . on the left side of the transition region the critical stress @xmath57 slowly increases with increasing system size .",
    "note that for the isotropic case the convergence to the thermodynamic limit is faster ; consequently , a more accurate estimation of the critical point @xmath2 could be done @xcite . in the present case , in order to find a reasonable estimation of @xmath63 , we used the fact that on the short range interaction region ( @xmath8 ) the convergence to the thermodynamic limit is qualitatively different than on the long range interaction region ( @xmath7 ) . on the @xmath7 side of the transition region the critical stress",
    "@xmath57 increases with increasing system size , towards the @xmath7 exact solution .",
    "contrary , on the @xmath8 side of the transition region @xmath57 vanishes logarithmically with increasing system size .",
    "despite the fact that figure [ figure1]a seems to indicate @xmath73 for @xmath74 , figure [ figure1]b also suggests that for any value @xmath75 , the critical value @xmath71 shifts towards @xmath76 as the thermodynamic limit is reached . for elucidating if the value of @xmath71 changes onces the anisotropy",
    "is introduced we then focused on @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "hence , changing the anisotropy strength @xmath0 and studying the convergence of @xmath57 to the thermodynamic limit , a better estimation of @xmath71 is done .    in figure [ figure2 ]",
    ", we describe the size dependency of the ultimate strength @xmath57 for a weibull distribution of thresholds with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "figure [ figure2]a and figure [ figure2]b illustrate the outcomes at @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "several anisotropy strengths were explored and it was found that when the system size is increased , the anisotropy plays a weaker role . moreover , as expected the system size dependence is more pronounced for @xmath78 than for @xmath77 .",
    "we note in fig.[figure2]b that numerical uncertainties surface when one gets numerically very close to @xmath43 , for small system sizes .",
    "that is due to the fact that in a @xmath5 square lattice topology as @xmath79 , the load sharing from one row to the next might become so small that the rows would become effectively decoupled .",
    "that is certainly an undesirable topology effect which might also magnify the system size effects .",
    "however , our results indicate that even in the presence of high anisotropy , at @xmath2 , the system shows a tendency to behave as @xmath7 when approaching to the thermodynamic limit , within our numerical uncertainties",
    ". consequently , the crossover point for the anisotropic variable range of interaction given by eq.([eq5 ] ) results at @xmath2 .    to test the universality of this statement , we did calculations for several threshold distributions .",
    "a weibull distribution with @xmath80 , as well as a uniform distribution were used for comparison . moreover , to access accurately the crossover point , several system sizes were considered . in every case , we changed @xmath0 using the values ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) . our aim is to elucidate how far from @xmath7 behavior the system is for @xmath78 , after the anisotropy is introduced . as we pointed out before , this value @xmath2 defines the crossover between @xmath7 and @xmath8 behaviors , for the isotropic case .    in figure  [ figure3 ] ,",
    "results of the ultimate strength of samples with strong anisotropy are shown in detail .",
    "the scaled magnitude @xmath83 is plotted against the `` distance '' @xmath84 from the well - defined @xmath7 s behavior . note that each symbol ( _ i.e. _ square , circle and diamond ) is related to a different threshold distribution .",
    "in addition , the sizes of the symbols are linked to different system sizes ( the bigger the symbol , the larger the system size ) .",
    "different regions of the plot , illustrated with the same symbol in five different sizes , correspond to a given value of @xmath0 ( from left to the right @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) . in the plots the data , corresponding to each threshold distribution , are aligned finding data collapse , @xmath85 where we have introduced the scaling function @xmath86 , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the results for a uniform distribution and weibull with @xmath65 are very similar .",
    "furthermore , decreasing the disorder , _",
    "e.g. _ weibull with @xmath80 and @xmath66 , only magnifies the topology and finite size effects .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath89 is universal , defining a new crossover exponent in @xmath0 and @xmath39 . from those results",
    ", one can conclude that the anisotropy does not change the crossover point for the range of interaction in 2d , @xmath2 . for finite systems ,",
    "the global behavior is reached very slowly , as we get far from @xmath88 .",
    "we also notice that the distance to the @xmath7 behavior @xmath90 does vanish in the infinite system size limit , as a power law @xmath91 , and we estimate @xmath92 .",
    "we conclude , that even in presence of high anisotropy the behavior of the system for @xmath93 shows a tendency to @xmath7 as @xmath94 .",
    "the infinite system would display a qualitatively different behavior only for @xmath88 , where it would become effectively a @xmath95 model , with @xmath96 .",
    "the fracture process can also be described by the precursory activity before complete breakdown .",
    "the statistical properties of rupture sequences are characterized by the avalanche size distribution . from an experimental point of view the precursory activity",
    "is related to the acoustic emissions generated during the fracture of materials @xcite .",
    "the avalanche size distribution is a measure of causally connected broken sites .",
    "all the intact elements have a non - zero chance to fail independently of the ( spatial ) rupture history , and any given element could be near to its rupture point regardless of its position in the lattice .    the highly fluctuating activity is certainly related to the long range interactions where the avalanche size distribution can usually be well fitted by a power law @xmath97 .",
    "this actually corresponds to the mean field scenario , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , when the spatial correlations are important @xmath8 , stress concentration takes place in the elements located at the perimeter of an already formed cluster .",
    "hence , elements far away from the clusters of broken elements have significantly lower stresses and thus the size of the largest avalanche is reduced as well as the number of failed elements belonging to the same avalanche , leading to lower precursory activity .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] illustrates the avalanche statistics obtained for systems with @xmath98 fibers . in every case , we have set @xmath78 and used different values of the anisotropy strength @xmath0 .",
    "it is noticeable that the avalanche size distributions can always be fitted to a power law with a non - trivial exponent .",
    "however , as we get far from @xmath43 the exponent tends asymptotically to the value @xmath99 , reflecting the tendency to recover the gls s behavior .    to characterize the system size dependence , we propose the following scaling ansatz for the avalanche size distribution , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a characteristic avalanche @xmath102 and @xmath103 is a scaling function that goes like @xmath104 for @xmath105 and decays faster than a power law for @xmath106 . in figure  [ figure5 ] ,",
    "the avalanche statistics resulting from systems with different sizes are shown .",
    "the model is again investigated at @xmath78 , and very strong anisotropy @xmath107 .",
    "the scaled function is presented in the inset .",
    "it can be seen that the data collapse yields @xmath108 and @xmath109 with a power law over several orders of magnitude in @xmath110 .",
    "this result suggests that for @xmath78 , even in presence of very high anisotropy , the avalanches are distributed as in the case of @xmath7 , namely as @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the crossover point is still at @xmath2 , even in the case of an anisotropic stress redistribution ( given by eq.([eq5 ] ) ) .",
    "long - range fiber bundle models can be considered as a first approximation to model the fracture behavior of a disordered elastic medium . it has been proposed in several instances to replace the full solution of the elastic equations by a green function @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage to avoid the computational cost involved in the inversion of the elastic equations , but in principle it is only accurate for diluted damage .",
    "a particularly simple example is provided by the random fuse model ( rfm ) in which a lattice of conducting bonds with random failure thresholds is loaded by applying an external voltage at the two ends of the lattice .",
    "when a fuse fails the current is redistributed to the neighboring fuses by solving the kirchhoff equations .",
    "when only a few bonds are broken , the current is transferred according to the homogeneous lattice green function which is given by @xmath112 in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a long - range ( with @xmath78 ) and anisotropic load transfer function , but of a different character than the one we have used here .",
    "we have simulated a fiber bundle model using a load transfer function inspired by the rfm .",
    "the general result is that the failure properties of our model resemble very much those of gls fiber bundles rather than those of the original rfm .",
    "this is particularly apparent when looking at the strength distribution , displayed in figure  [ figure6 ] .",
    "both the mean - field gls approach and our result obtained with the rfm load transfer function obey gaussian statistics .",
    "notice that the original rfm displays instead a qualitatively different log - normal strength distribution @xcite .",
    "this confirms that the green function approach is reliable at most in the initial stages of the damage accumulation process and it is not correct to describe the global failure of the rfm .",
    "figure [ figure6 ] also shows that anisotropic lls functions result instead in a larger scattering of ultimate strength , and their asymmetric distributions are usually fitted by weibull distribution functions .",
    "it is noticeable from the data that introducing very high anisotropy strength amplifies the scattering in the global strength of the samples .",
    "however , the strength distribution for the anisotropic system appears to be closer to a _ gaussian _ in contrast to the _ classical _ weibull behavior , which is usually obtained for lls approaches .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied a discrete fracture model where the interaction among elements is considered to decay anisotropically with the distance from an intact element to the rupture point .",
    "the two classical regimes ( local and global ) are found as the exponent of the stress - transfer function varies and a crossover point is again identified in the vicinity of @xmath2 .",
    "the strength of the material for @xmath113 does not depend on both the system size and @xmath1 qualifying for mean - field behavior , whereas for the short range regime , the critical load vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the behavior of the model at both sides of the crossover point was numerically studied by recording the avalanche and the critical stress for several system sizes . from our numerical results",
    ", one can certainly conclude that the anisotropy does not change the crossover point @xmath2 in the 2d model , in the infinite system size limit .",
    "the @xmath5 model would display a qualitatively different behavior only for @xmath88 , where it would become effectively a @xmath95 model , with @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , in finite systems for @xmath3 , the global load sharing behavior is very slowly recovered as we get far from @xmath88 , within our numerical uncertainties .",
