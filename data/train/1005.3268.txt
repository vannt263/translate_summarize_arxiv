    "graphene is also an ideal test - bed for some long - standing problems , such as the raman spectra of carbon materials .",
    "here we show that this conceptually simple material ( due to its low - dimensionality ) can be helpful in understanding the basics of surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) .",

    "raman spectroscopy allows monitoring of doping , defects , strain , disorder , chemical modifications and edges@xcite .",

    "the raman signal is to perform sers experiments@xcite .",
    "sers is widely used@xcite , and enhancements as large as 14 orders of magnitude can be achieved ( enough for single - molecule detection@xcite ) .",
    "however , even though the technique is more than 30 years old@xcite , the exact nature of sers is still debated@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the particular mechanism might be different , depending on whether the raman processes involved are resonant or not . in principle",
    ", even a single metallic nanostructure , e.g. , a metallic nanotip , can induce sers at its apex , giving rise to the so - called tip - enhanced raman scattering ( ters)@xcite .",
    "the most important feature that makes ters so attractive is its capability of optical sensing with high spatial resolution beyond the light diffraction limits@xcite .",
    "most sers - active systems studied to - date are based on random nanostructures , whose properties vary from experiment to experiment making quantitative comparison between theory and experiment difficult",
    ". graphene offers a unique model system where sers effects could be studied in detail .",
    "its raman spectrum is well known , being investigated in several hundreds papers in the past 4 years .",
    "graphene samples are very reproducible and offer an atomic - precision control on the number of layers , thus allowing a smooth transition from a purely 2d case to a 3d one .",
    "furthermore , as both resonant and non - resonant raman scattering can be in principle possible , such as in chemically modified graphene@xcite , a distinction between different enhancement mechanisms could be made .",
    "here we focus on the resonant case , where we believe the enhancement is mostly due to near - field plasmonic effects in the vicinity of metal particles@xcite .",

    "the raman enhancement is defined as the ratio of the raman intensity measured on the graphene covered by dots , compared to that measured outside the dots , but still on the graphene layer , fig .",
    "2 .    fig .",
    "3 shows representative raman spectra measured at 633 nm .",
    "a clear enhancement is seen when comparing the patterned and the unpatterned graphene .",
    "the raman spectrum of graphene consists of a set of distinct peaks .",
    "the g and d appear around 1580 and 1350 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the g peak corresponds to the @xmath2 phonon at the brillouin zone center ( @xmath3  point ) .",
    "the d peak is due to the breathing modes of six - atom rings and requires a defect for its activation@xcite .",
    "it comes from to phonons around the * k * point@xcite , is active by double resonance ( dr)@xcite , and is strongly dispersive with excitation energy due to a kohn anomaly at * * k**@xcite .",
    "dr can also happen as intra - valley process , i.  e. connecting two points belonging to the same cone around @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) .",
    "this gives the so - called dpeak , which is at@xmath6 in defected graphite measured at 514 nm .",
    "the 2d peak is the second order of the d peak .",
    "this is a single peak in single layer graphene ( slg ) , whereas it splits in four in bilayer graphene ( blg ) , reflecting the evolution of the band structure@xcite .",
    "the 2d peak is the second order of d. since 2d and 2d originate from a process where momentum conservation is satisfied by two phonons with opposite wavevectors , no defects are required for their activation , and are thus always present .",
    "each raman peak is characterized by its position , width , height , and area .",
    "the frequency - integrated area under each peak represents the probability of the whole process .",
    "it is more robust with respect to various perturbations of the phonon states than width and height@xcite .",
    "indeed , for an ideal case of dispersionless undamped phonons with frequency @xmath7 , the shape of the @xmath8-phonon peak is a dirac @xmath9 distribution @xmath10 , with zero width , infinite height , but well - defined area .",
    "if the phonons decay ( e.  g , into other phonons , due to anharmonicity , or into electron - hole pairs , due to electron - phonon coupling ) , the @xmath9 lineshape broadens into a lorentzian , but the area is preserved , as the total number of phonon states can not be changed by such perturbations . if phonons have a weak dispersion , states with different momenta contribute at slightly different frequencies .",
    "this may result in an overall shift and a non - trivial peak shape , but frequency integration across the peak means counting all phonon states , as in the dispersionless case .",
    "thus , the peak area is preserved , as long as the raman matrix element itself is not changed significantly by the perturbation .",
    "the latter holds when the perturbation ( phonon broadening or dispersion ) is smaller than the typical energy scale determining the matrix element . converting this into a time scale using the uncertainty principle",
    "we have that , if the raman process is faster than the phonon decay , the total number of photons emitted within a given peak ( i.  e. , integrated over frequency across the peak ) , is not affected by phonon decay , although their spectral distribution can be .",
    "even if the graphene phonons giving rise to the d and d peaks are dispersive@xcite , their relative change with respect to the average phonon energy is at most a few % , thus we are in the weakly dispersive case .",
    "the phonon decay in graphene is in the ps timescale , while the raman process is faster , in the fs timescale@xcite .",
    "we thus consider both the area , a(2d)/a(g ) , and height , i(2d)/i(g ) , ratios@xcite .",
    "fig 4 plots them for the two dot sizes and as a function of excitation energy .",
    "we model our experiment with the calculation box shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "starting from the bottom , this consists of a semi - infinite si substrate , a 300 nm sio@xmath0 and slg of effective thickness 0.335 nm .",
    "on slg , we have a au / cr disk with thickness 80nm/5 nm , with the diameter set to either 140 or 210 nm , according to the experimental au dot size .",
    "we time - integrate maxwell s equations using the finite - difference time - domain method(fdtd)@xcite as implemented in refs@xcite ( see methods ) . for the absorbing boundary conditions in the vertical direction we use the perfectly - matched - layer method ( pml)@xcite , while in the lateral directions we use periodic boundary conditions simulating an infinite two - dimensional square array of au / cr nanodisks .",
    "we previously investigated the plasmonic resonances of similar nanoparticles ( prepared in exactly the same conditions as in the present work)@xcite .",
    "this allowed us to extract the au and cr optical constants as obtained in our evaporators@xcite .",
    "we also recently measured the optical constants of graphene by spectroscopic ellipsometry@xcite .",

    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilons ] in methods .",
    "finally , for simplicity we use n=1.46 for sio@xmath0 , n=4 for si@xcite .",
    "the lateral periodicity is 320 nm in both directions .",
    "we consider nanodisk diameters of 210 and 140 nm , corresponding to the large and small dots , width=302 ]    we only consider normal incidence and emission , relevant for our raman backscattering experiments .",
    "the incident field is a wide spectrum plane wave ( i.e. a narrow gaussian temporal profile ) coming from the top .",
    "we monitor the electric fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 at each grid point on the graphene plane , and upon fourier transform we get the tangential - field amplitude @xmath13 in frequency domain .",
    "this is enhanced compared to the incident field , due to substrate interference , and the surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) near field of the nanodisks .",
    "assuming the graphene absorption at a particular point to be proportional to the incident tangential field intensity at that point , the raman emission from a particular point to be proportional to the corresponding stokes - shifted intensity , and the emission from points underneath the nanodisks to be reabsorbed and lost , we may approximate the total raman signal as@xcite : @xmath14 where the integration is performed over the area not directly underneath the nanodisks , and @xmath15 is the stokes shifted frequency . @xmath16 , with @xmath17 is the raman shift ( in @xmath1 ) .",
    "the outcome of eq .",
    "[ eq : approximation ] is normalized by the corresponding calculation for suspended graphene ( where the integral is over all the area since there are no nondisks to cover the emission ) .",
    "we note that , given the large absorption of @xmath182.3% per graphene layer@xcite , this approximation becomes questionable for local absorption enhancements greater than@xmath1843 . to amend this we cut above 43 .",
    "emission saturation , on the other hand , can not be reached because the raman efficiency , even though larger than other materials due to the process being always resonant , is in absolute terms very small@xcite , and would require @xmath19 enhancement to exceed 100% .        in order to account for",
    "the graphene layer thickness and still keep the simulation reasonably fast , we employ an anisotropic grid with 0.335 nm spacing in the vertical and 2 nm in the lateral dimension . by calculations on smaller cells we verified that such a grid introduces small errors , typically less than 5% and never exceeding 10% . considering our approximations up to this point ( normal incidence and the approximation in eq .",
    "[ eq : approximation ] ) , we find this to be well within the overall simulation errors .",
    "the 300 nm sio@xmath0/si substrate interferometrically increases not only the visibility@xcite but also the raman signal of graphene@xcite .",
    "here we expect an additional enhancement due to the au nanodisks spr near field . in order to distinguish between the two effects ( substrate interference and spr ) ,",
    "we separately calculate both cases for unpatterned slg on sio@xmath0/si and slg patterned with the au nanodisks , still on sio@xmath0/si .",
    "we define the interference enhancement factor @xmath20 as the ratio of the raman signal from unpatterned slg on sio@xmath0/si to that of suspended slg , @xmath21 , and the total enhancement factor @xmath22 as the ratio of the raman signal from patterned slg on sio@xmath0/si to that of suspended slg : @xmath23 .",
    "[ fig : enhancement1 ] plots such factors for the g and 2d peaks .",
    "this gives a maximum interference - related enhancement @xmath20 at 550 nm of@xmath182.5 for the g peak and @xmath182 for the 2d .",
    "however , this is very modest compared to the total enhancement @xmath22 when the nanodisks are taken into account .",
    "the total enhancement reaches up to 50 , and is maximum at different wavelengths depending on the nanodisk diameter .",
    "the shoulder at 550 nm is likely related to interference , because ( i ) it is at the same frequency as the interference peak and ( ii ) it is stronger the further the plasmon peak .",
    "there is a different enhancement for the two disk diameters , not only in peak value , but also in wavelength .",
    "this is a size effect : the nanodisks are comparable to the incident laser wavelength . thus ,",
    "retardation effects and higher order multipole terms become important , modifying the plasmon response as a function of disk size .",
    "[ fig : intensitypatterns ] plots the distribution of the tangential intensity enhancement in the graphene plane at 633 nm , which is approximately proportional to the absorption enhancement at that wavelength .",
    "different patterns appear for the two sizes , demonstrating the point made above .         for a ) the g - band and b ) the 2d - band .",
    "squares and crosses are the experimental raman intensities and areas.,width=321 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : enhancement2 ] compares @xmath24 to the corresponding experimental raman intensity ratios . considering all approximations made , and the fact that some of the measurements where on top of distorted parts of the nanodisk arrays , the agreement is good .",
    "we find low enhancement for 488 and 514 nm , and large for 633 nm .",
    "also , we reproduce the higher enhancement for the g peak in the small disks at 633 nm , and for the 2d peak in the large disks .",
    "the quantitative agreement for the 2d peak is not as good , however , this is expected given that its intensity significantly depends on electron - electron interactions , which could change in presence of gold@xcite .",
    "the agreement between experiment and simulation is encouraging .",
    "it also allows to get new physical insights into the sers process of an extended 2d system , like graphene .",
    "the basic physics and detailed theory of the electromagnetic contribution to sers on adsorbed molecules is well known@xcite : both absorption and emission are enhanced due to interaction with surface plasmons , with an expected overall dependence on the fourth power of the spr - mediated field enhancement@xcite . however , a detailed theory for 2d systems is lacking .",
    "such formulation is challenging for our experiment : the au particles do not have a regular spherical or ellipsoidal shape , they are large and so multipoles higher than dipole contribute , there is a thin cr layer , we are on sio@xmath0/si giving additional interference and enhancement effects .",
    "we thus consider the simplified case of regular - shaped small au nanoparticles inside a uniform medium .",
    "this will provide all the new physics for sers in graphene , or generally any 2d system .",

    "<S> surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) exploits surface plasmons induced by the incident field in metallic nanostructures to significantly increase the raman intensity . </S>",
    "<S> graphene provides the ideal prototype two dimensional ( 2d ) test material to investigate sers . </S>",
    "<S> its raman spectrum is well known , graphene samples are entirely reproducible , height controllable down to the atomic scale , and can be made virtually defect - free . </S>",
    "<S> we report sers from graphene , by depositing arrays of au particles of well defined dimensions on graphene / sio@xmath0(300nm)/si . </S>",
    "<S> we detect significant enhancements at 633 nm . to elucidate the physics of sers , </S>",
    "<S> we develop a quantitative analytical and numerical theory . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d nature of graphene allows for a closed - form description of the raman enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> this scales with the nanoparticle cross section , the fourth power of the mie enhancement , and is inversely proportional to the tenth power of the separation between graphene and the nanoparticle . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence is that metallic nanodisks are an ideal embodiment for sers in 2d . </S>"
