    "her  x-1 ( tananbaum 1972 ) is an eclipsing x - ray binary containing a pulsar of 1.4   and an a7 stellar companion of 2.2 ( middleditch & nelson 1976 ; reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "the system displays behaviour on four separate periods  the pulsar spin ( 1.24-s ) , the binary orbit ( 1.7-d ) , a super period of 35-d which results from a retrograde - precessing , warped accretion disk , and a beat between the precessional and orbital periods of 1.62-d .",
    "the warp phenomenon is poorly understood but its source is likely to be a combination of both tide- and radiation - driven precession ( papaloizou & tarquem 1995 ; pringle 1996 ) .",
    "the 35-d super - cycle results in two phases of strong x - ray activity per cycle ( giacconi 1973 ; scott & leahy 1999 ) .",
    "the main - high state has a rapid turn - on over @xmath090-m and decays over @xmath010-d .",
    "an off - state where flux remains at @xmath01 percent of the main - high state level follows for the next @xmath010-d , succeeded by a second short - high state , lasting @xmath05-d , with flux peaking at @xmath030 percent of maximum .",
    "a further off - state completes the cycle and extends over the next @xmath010-d .",
    "the accretion disk casts a shadow over the surface of the companion star which migrates across the star on the beat frequency .",
    "the super - cycle is consequently observed at uv and optical energies which are dominated by x - ray emission reprocessed in the stellar atmosphere ( gerend & boynton 1976 ) .",
    "the 35-d clock has remained mostly coherent since it s discovery .",
    "there have however been three occasions when the clock has missed several consecutive turn - ons , or main - high flux has been reduced ( parmar 1985 ; vrtilek 1994 ; parmar 1999 ) . the cause of these anomalous low - states is not clear , but probably result from changes in the state of the accretion disk , either through an increase in vertical scale height , or disruption to the disk warp .",
    "however the level of reprocessed uv and optical flux from the companion star during these states suggests that the intrinsic x - ray flux , and presumably the accretion rate , remains mostly unaffected by this event ( vrtilek 1994 ; 2001 ) .",
    "the high orbital inclination of the binary indicates that perhaps just a small variation in the disk geometry will block direct x - rays from our line - of - sight , while the companion stars view remains largely unchanged over much of its surface area .",
    "the latest anomalous low - state began during 1999 feb ( parmar 1999 ) and the on - states had not recovered four cycles later when the current observations were scheduled .",
    "these were part of a simultaneous multi - wavelength campaign on   described by vrtilek ( 2001 ) .",
    "results from simultaneous hubble space telescope orbits are detailed by boroson ( 2000 ) and boroson ( 2001 ) , and an earlier epoch of short - high state visits with by still ( 2001 ) .",
    "the current  data reveal many similarities between the x - ray light curve and its optical / uv counterparts , suggesting that much of the anomalous low state x - ray emission could be of companion star origin .",
    "we find that cold compton reflection is a statistically acceptable model for the energy spectrum and a reflection surface the size and distance from the pulsar of the companion star gives a good prediction of the incident x - ray flux provided this is identical to the peak of the normal on - state intensity .",
    "the possible detection of a relatively clean reflection spectrum in a well - determined binary geometry , free of dominant direct x - rays , would be a valuable resource for investigators of reflecting atmospheres in the less well - determined environments of agn and stellar black hole candidates ( lightman & white ; white , lightman and zdziarski 1988 ) .",

    "this is consistent with a region associated with the irradiated inner surface of the companion star .",
    "the similarities between this light curve and the optical , uv and euv light curves which are dominated by companion star emission are striking ( still 1997 ; leahy & marshall 1999 ; boroson 2000 ) .",
    "we suggest that the modulation is the result of compton reflection of x - rays off the atmosphere of the companion , which was predicted by basko , sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1974 ) and detected at euv wavelengths by leahy & marshall ( 1999 ) and leahy ( 2000 ) .",
    "if we are detecting companion star reflection , there must be a second source of x - ray flux associated with the compact object in order to produce the narrow eclipses at mjd51372.0 , mjd51373.7 and mjd51375.4 .",
    "there are equivalent eclipses at optical and uv wavelengths which are thought to be the eclipse of disk light by the companion star ( gerend & boynton 1976 ; boroson 2000 ) .    after removing eclipses and using the lomb - scargle statistic ( scargle 1982 ) ,",

    "as predicted , @xmath121 is modulated on the orbital period , with a maximum at @xmath66 0.5 , although similar coherency is not discernible in @xmath122 .",
    "despite the reflection effect in  being observed in the euv band ( leahy & marshall 1999 ; leahy 2000 ) , this is the first convincing detection of the phenomenon at x - ray energies .",
    "basko ( 1974 ) demonstrated that x - ray reflected flux from the companion star in   should be at the level a few percent of the intrinsic radiation .",
    "this should generally be washed out by shot noise from the central source during normal main - high states , but as in the current observations , should also be observable during normal low states of the 35-d cycle .",
    "sheffer ( 1992 ) claimed a tentative detection of reflection during a normal off - state during the _ astron _ mission , but a systematic search for this effect during normal or anomalous low - states has never been undertaken ; the heasarc archive is not rich with data from these epochs and those that exist coincide with eclipses of the pulsar ( e.g. choi 1997 ) .",
    "exceptions are the _ exosat _ pointings by parmar ( 1985 ) , the _ bepposax _ observations of parmar ( 1999 ) and the  visits by coburn ( 2000 ) .",
    "none of these analyses consider reflection as a possible interpretation of data , but the count rates presented by parmar ( 1985 ; 1999 ) arguably both display 1.7-d modulation .",
    "the baseline of the coburn ( 2000 ) visits is 20  ksec covering   = 0.640.77 .",
    "the general trend in count rate over this period is one of decline , as predicted by the reflection model ( fig .",
    "[ lcfit ] ) , although the count rate and decline are a factor two larger than the current data .",
    "potentially ,   contains a rich lode of reflection physics .",
    "the reflection effect is common to a large number of different x - ray sources such as agn and stellar mass black hole ( lightman & white ; white 1988 ) .",
    "but generally there is uncertainty concerning the physical location and size of hard radiation sources in these objects , and the size and shape of the reflecting atmosphere ( which in these cases is presumably an accretion disk ) .",
    "therefore her x-1 is an ideal x - ray source for studying the properties of reflection and associated processes ( such as winds and coronae etc ) because we have a relatively clear picture of companion star geometry and its illumination by well - measured hard radiation from a central object .    despite this",
    "there are some limitations .",
    "firstly it is not clear how , or whether , the x - ray emission from the pulsar is beamed , or how column density changes with disk inclination angle . although the high inclination of the binary means the observer has a similar line of sight to the source as the equatorial regions of the companion star , surface elements closer to the stellar poles may perceive the central source differently . in this paper",
    "we have assumed the source is an isotropic emitter .",
    "also we assume that the x - ray source is point - like .",
    "this is not true , since we observe scattered light from a disk corona and expect further scattering and reflection from the disk itself ; leahy ( 1995 ) showed that soft photons come from an extended region using eclipse timings .",
    "furthermore we made no attempt to model the accretion disk shadow , or its eclipse , over the equatorial regions of the companion star since the disk shape is so poorly constrained .",
    "the reflection process itself is also treated simply .",
    "more sophisticated models by ( e.g. ross & fabian 1993 ; nayakshin 2000 ) consider the physical response of an atmosphere to irradiation and the resultant spectral changes .",
    "there is scope for much more observation .",
    "the reflection model can be tested more sensitively with improved models and greater energy resolution using grating spectrometers sensitive to soft energies below 1  which should be populated by resonance absorption edges ( basko 1974 ) , and over the fe@xmath57 complex to resolve and separate line components between corona and companion star . in order to constrain the location of reflection , timing experiments with",
    "improved sampling over the 35-d cycle would determine whether light curve modulation is driven on the orbital ( 1.7-d ) or beat ( 1.6-d ) period .",
    "fast timing visits during eclipses of the companion by the accretion disk at  = 0.5 can help constrain the shape of the accretion disk using the eclipse ingress and egress profiles .",
    "over 2.7 orbital cycles during the anomalous low - state of 1999 the x - ray pulsar  displayed an x - ray light curve very similar to optical and uv counterparts , suggesting that the companion star contributes to x - ray emission .",
    "a cold compton reflection spectrum was successfully fit to the variable component of the energy spectrum . by employing binary geometry and assuming companion star reflection , the intensity of the hidden pulsar was found to be identical to the main - high state of the source when the pulsar is visible .",
    "this result indirectly implies the anomalous low - state model is correct ",
    "intrinsic accretion luminosity remains constant , but is occulted along the observers line - of - sight by the accretion disk .",
