    "<S> flip and exchange symmetric ( fes ) many - qubit states , which can be obtained from a state with the same symmetries by means of invertible local operations ( ilo ) , constitute a set of curves in the hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> eigenstates of fes ilos correspond to vectors that can not be transformed to other fes states . </S>",
    "<S> this means equivalence classes of states under ilo can be determined in a systematic way for an arbitrary number of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> more important , for entangled states , at the boundaries of neighboring equivalence classes , one can show that when the fidelity between the final state after an ilo and a state of the neighboring class approaches unity , probability of success decreases to zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the classes are stable under ilos .    for composite systems , quantum states which can not be written as a product of the states of individual subsystems have been recognized since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon , called entanglement , is at the center of quantum information theory since it is a key resource in quantum processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a natural class of operations suitable for manipulating entanglement is that of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite . for probabilistic transformations </S>",
    "<S> , the condition of certainty can be removed to allow conversion of the states through stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this coarse graining simplifies the equivalence classes labeled by continuous parameters in case of the local unitary operations . </S>",
    "<S> two states are equivalent under slocc if an invertible local operation ( ilo ) relating them exists @xcite . for example , in case of three qubits , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are in the same equivalence class if @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are invertible operators corresponding to each party </S>",
    "<S> .    all entangled pure states of two qubits can be converted to the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) @xmath6 state under slocc @xcite . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , there is a single equivalence class . for three qubits , by calculating transformed states explicitly , it has been shown that there are two inequivalent states ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> starting from four qubits , equivalence classes of multipartite systems are labeled by at least one continuous parameter @xcite . using the isomorphism @xmath9 from lie group theory , </S>",
    "<S> nine different ways of entanglement have been found for four qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are no complete classifications for five or more qubits . </S>",
    "<S> however , for exchange symmetric @xmath10qubit states , entanglement classification under slocc has been achieved by introducing two parameters called diversity degree and degeneracy configuration . </S>",
    "<S> also , the number of families has been shown to grow as the partition function of the number of qubits @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> flip and exchange symmetric ( fes ) many - qubit states are those having both permutation ( exchange ) and 0 - 1 ( flip ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> namely , fes sates are invariant when two qubits are interchanged or when all 0s ( 1s ) are changed to 1s ( 0s ) . in the last few years , there has been extensive studies on the entanglement properties of symmetric multipartite states @xcite . the main reason for utilization of fes states </S>",
    "<S> is the simplicity of the form of their entanglement classes under slocc . </S>",
    "<S> since any linear combination of two fes states is also fes , they form a subspace whose dimension is @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes integer part function . therefore , for large @xmath13 values dimension </S>",
    "<S> is approximately @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of the present work is to study stability of slocc equivalence classes under ilo in the fes subspace . </S>",
    "<S> such a restriction may seem to be an oversimplification when compared to the @xmath15 dimensional hilbert space problem . however , fes states are important if one considers for example bosonic qubits where exchange symmetry is essential . </S>",
    "<S> the classification method to be presented is distinguished in two ways : it is systematic and it gives information about neighboring equivalence classes and their relative sizes . </S>",
    "<S> more important , it justifies the slocc classification in the sense that at the boundaries of different classes , probabilities to end up with states arbitrarily close to the states of neighboring classes are shown to be vanishing .    * definition : * @xmath0 is a fes @xmath10qubit state if it satisfies @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the qubit flip operator and @xmath18 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is the exchange operator for the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> the three qubit state @xmath22 is fes , and @xmath23 can be made fes with a simple ilo . </S>",
    "<S> how near @xmath24type and @xmath25type states can be is one of the questions addressed in this study .    imposing exchange symmetry </S>",
    "<S> greatly simplifies the classification problem . </S>",
    "<S> all local operators become identical and thus will be denoted by @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> qubit flip symmetry reduces the number of parameters , i.e. , entries of the @xmath27 matrix @xmath26 , from four to two . </S>",
    "<S> hence , fes ilos can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath30 and @xmath31 can not simultaneously vanish , @xmath26 can be simplified further through division by @xmath30 or @xmath31 . for @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and the function @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> will be shown to be bounded . </S>",
    "<S> all of the results of the current work remain the same for the @xmath36 case where the diagonal and the anti - diagonal of @xmath37 are simply interchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath38 be a normalized arbitrary @xmath13 qubit fes state . </S>",
    "<S> all equivalent normalized states can then be written as @xmath39 which are fes as well . </S>",
    "<S> they lie on a curve parametrized by @xmath40 provided that @xmath40 is real . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath40 changes from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , excluding @xmath43 , @xmath44 traces the curve . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath38 turns out to be an eigenstate of @xmath45 , no ilo will alter it or by definition @xmath38 will form an equivalence class by itself . </S>",
    "<S> eigenstates of @xmath46 are of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and number of @xmath49 and @xmath50 states in the kronecker product are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> flip symmetric ones are those with even @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> eigenvalues are given by @xmath54 and they are @xmath55 fold degenerate .    * definition : * the eigenstate @xmath56 denotes the fes state obtained by evaluating the symmetric linear combination of degenerate eigenstates corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath57 given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lambda ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , four qubit @xmath56 states are given by @xmath58    there is a basis of the symmetric subspace in terms of dicke states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can label these states according to the number of 0 s as @xmath59 and it is easy to see that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the hadamard matrix @xmath62    in the context of geometric measure of entanglement , it has been shown that the closest product state to any symmetric multi - qubit state is necessarily symmetric @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 is the only fes product state for odd @xmath13 . for even @xmath13 , @xmath64 is also fes . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that , among the symmetric product states of the form @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which corresponds to @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , are the closest ones to the generalized ghz state given by @xmath70 therefore , the closest product state to a generalized ghz state is not necessarily fes .    in practice , </S>",
    "<S> the only constraint on @xmath26 is @xmath71 if @xmath26 is to come from a positive operator - valued measure . here </S>",
    "<S> the denominator gives the probability of obtaining the final state @xmath44 from @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> for a given set of transformations @xmath72 leading to different final states , the normalization condition is @xmath73 with the immediate consequence @xmath74 .    for two qubits , possible even @xmath53 values </S>",
    "<S> are 0 and 2 . both are nondegenerate and hence the corresponding eigenstates are separable . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there are no entangled fes states unreachable from the epr state by means of ilo , which is a very well known result @xcite .    in case of three qubits , allowed </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 values are the same as above , but this time while @xmath75 corresponds to a separable state @xmath76 , @xmath77 is threefold degenerate and it is easy to see that the eigenvector @xmath78 is equivalent to the @xmath8 state . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath8 is distinguished from other three - qubit entangled states , for example from @xmath79 , in that it is unreachable via ilo which was again noticed earlier @xcite . having real expansion coefficients in the computational basis , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80 with @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , @xmath79 lies on the geodesic connecting the separable @xmath82 state and the @xmath8 state transformed into fes form by means of ilos . for @xmath83 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath44 is again on the same geodesic and approaches the fes @xmath8 state when @xmath84 , where the probability @xmath85 $ ] goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> such a tradeoff between fidelity and conversion probability was pointed out and experimentally implemented by walther _ et al_. @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath44 tends to @xmath82 as @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , almost all fes three qubit states are equivalent to @xmath79 under ilo while @xmath8 and @xmath82 are two neighbors of this equivalence class . </S>",
    "<S> ghz - equivalent states are stable under ilo in the sense that the nearer the final state @xmath44 to @xmath8 , the less is the probability of success . for </S>",
    "<S> a graphical representation see figure  1 .    </S>",
    "<S> allowed @xmath53 values for four qubits are 0 , 2 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the first and the third are separable @xmath87 and @xmath88 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the only interesting one is @xmath89 which is nothing but @xmath90 in the notation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where @xmath91 is defined by @xmath92 since there are three different eigenstates , the fes subspace is a sphere . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to show that all curves start and end on @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and they either do not pass through @xmath89 or the probability decays to zero as @xmath44 approaches @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the four qubit problem is the simplest non - trivial case in the sense that there is more than one curve ; there are in fact infinitely many curves . among the nine classes of four qubit states , </S>",
    "<S> the only fes one is @xmath91 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and it corresponds to a great circle on the sphere passing through @xmath89 and making equal angles with @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , all fes four qubit states are equivalent to a @xmath95 state under ilo and @xmath90 is a distinguished entangled state in that it is unreachable starting from the ones with @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath95 corresponds to the canonical form @xmath97 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where@xmath98 is the four qubit dicke state with two @xmath99 components and @xmath100 . for a graphical representation see figure  1 .    in the case of five qubits , </S>",
    "<S> there are two entangled fes eigenstates : @xmath101 and @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are two slocc inequivalent six qubit entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> the five qubit case is the same as the four qubit problem in the sense that both are three dimensional spaces . in general </S>",
    "<S> an odd number qubit problem is equivalent to one less even case . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is possible to see without any calculation that @xmath101 is a fes entangled state which can not be reached by ilos starting from the others . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the curves join @xmath105 to @xmath102 , but conversion probability decreases to zero as @xmath44 tends to @xmath102 . in case of six qubits , curves extend from @xmath106 to @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> they either do not pass through @xmath103 and @xmath104 or if they reach these two states , probability for such processes vanish .    for @xmath13 qubits </S>",
    "<S> , the most general fes state can be written as @xmath108 where the sum runs over even @xmath53 so that there will be @xmath11 terms and @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> here,@xmath110 stands for the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> one or two of @xmath56 states will be separable , for odd and even @xmath13 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> application of a fes ilo gives @xmath112 which lies on the sphere @xmath113 . on the surface of the sphere , </S>",
    "<S> a subset described by @xmath114 free parameters will be enough to obtain all fes states by means of ilos . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , provided that @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the latter being an entangled state for odd @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> a representative subset can be obtained by taking one point from each such curve connecting the two states . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in case of four qubits this is achieved by @xmath95 which cuts all the curves from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .    </S>",
    "<S> * theorem : * let @xmath13 be even so that both @xmath118 and @xmath119 are separable . </S>",
    "<S> entangled states @xmath56 ( @xmath120 ) are stable under ilos in the sense that either no ilo generated curve ( given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ curve ] ) ) will pass through them or even if there is a curve containing @xmath56 ( for @xmath121 or @xmath122 ) , probability of success will be decreasing to zero as @xmath44 tends to @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> * proof : * let @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) be the only non - vanishing coefficients so that the curve becomes the geodesic connecting @xmath56 and @xmath126 . since @xmath127 $ ] , @xmath128 and @xmath129 limits correspond to @xmath126 and @xmath56 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the vectors vanish in these two limiting cases and therefore probabilities for these events to occur go to zero . </S>",
    "<S> if more than two expansion coefficients are non - vanishing , it is not possible to reach all eigenstates @xmath56 in the sense that @xmath56 has a small enough neighborhood which does not contain any points of the curve . </S>",
    "<S> only those curves where @xmath51 is the largest or smallest of the subscripts of non - vanishing @xmath123 coefficients pass through @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this ends the proof .    </S>",
    "<S> the odd qubit @xmath130 problem is equivalent to the even @xmath131 case in the sense that both are @xmath132 dimensional problems and there is a one - to - one correspondence between the components of the vectors in two spaces given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath135 does not change the vector since they are all to be normalized but probabilities do change . while @xmath136 is a reachable and separable state , the corresponding odd space partner @xmath137 is entangled and </S>",
    "<S> can not be approached arbitrarily closely since the probability decays to zero for such processes .    </S>",
    "<S> stability or unreachability properties are specific to entangled eigenstates of @xmath46 . for separable states probabilities of being approached </S>",
    "<S> are in general nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> this is understandable since local measurements are enough to collapse the whole wave function into a separable one . </S>",
    "<S> for entangled states in different equivalence classes conversion probability is clearly zero . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that , at least for fes entangled states , even though the final state is in the same equivalence class as the initial state , probability of success decays to zero as the final state becomes nearer to the boundaries of the equivalence class .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> a systematic method to classify fes @xmath10qubit entangled states has been presented . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that ilos result in a set of curves in the hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> some entangled states , namely eigenstates of fes ilos , embedded in other entangled states , have been found to be either totally unreachable , i.e. , no curves pass through them , or even if they are on a curve , the probability decays to zero as they are approached . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is important because it justifies slocc classification . </S>",
    "<S> as one approaches to a boundary between two different classes , probabilities get smaller and smaller . </S>",
    "<S> since probability is a continuous function , the same results must hold for states not necessarily fes but in the vicinity of fes ones . finally , fes entangled @xmath10qubit states given above are also good tests for algebraic invariants proposed to distinguish slocc equivalence classes @xcite . even though general slocc classification is a difficult problem , </S>",
    "<S> fes subspace classification is trivial and hence one can start from this easy case to propose new invariants . </S>"
