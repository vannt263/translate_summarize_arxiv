    "on the basis of a rich body of astronomical observations there is now convincing evidence that the recent ( @xmath0 ) universe is dominated by an exotic nearly homogeneous dark energy density with _ negative _ pressure . the simplest candidate for this unknown",
    "so - called _ dark energy _",
    "( de ) is a cosmological term in einstein s field equations , a possibility that has been considered during all the history of relativistic cosmology .",
    "independently of what this exotic energy density is , one thing is certain since a long time : the energy density belonging to the cosmological constant is not larger than the cosmological critical density , and thus _ incredibly small by particle physics standards_. this is a profound mystery , since we expect that all sorts of _ vacuum energies _ contribute to the effective cosmological constant .",
    "since this is such an important issue for fundamental physics , astrophysics and cosmology , it should be of interest to indicate how convincing the evidence for this finding really is , or whether one should still remain sceptical .",
    "much of this is based on the observed temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , and large scale structure formation . when combined with other measurements a cosmological world model of the friedmann - lematre variety",
    "has emerged that is spatially almost flat , with about 70% of its energy contained in the form of dark energy .",
    "the first serious evidence for a currently accelerating universe , and still the only direct one , came from the hubble diagram for type ia supernovae , that are good  although not perfect  standard candles .    in an ideal friedmann - lematre universe",
    ", it is easy to establish a relationship between the luminosity distance , @xmath1 , of an ideal standard candle and and the redshift , @xmath2 , of the source .",
    "we recall that @xmath1 is defined by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the intrinsic luminosity of the source and @xmath5 the observed energy flux .",
    "astronomers use as logarithmic measures of @xmath4 and @xmath5 the _ absolute and apparent magnitudes _ , astronomers also use magnitudes @xmath6 referring to certain wavelength bands @xmath7 ( blue ) , @xmath8 ( visual ) , and so on . ] , denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the conventions are chosen such that the _ distance modulus _",
    "@xmath11 is related to @xmath1 as follows @xmath12    with the help of the freedmann equations one can express the product of the hubble parameter , @xmath13 , and @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 and the cosmological density parameters @xmath14 for the various species , @xmath15 , of the energy - matter content , including dark energy .",
    "the comparison of the resulting theoretical _ magnitude - redshift relation _ with data leads to interesting restrictions for the cosmological @xmath16-parameters . in practice often",
    "only @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the density corresponding to the cosmological constant @xmath19 , are kept as independent parameters , where from now on the subscript @xmath9 denotes non - relativistic ( mostly cold dark ) matter .    in view of the complex physics involved",
    ", it is not astonishing that type ia supernovas are not perfect standard candles .",
    "their peak absolute magnitudes have a dispersion of 0.3 - 0.5 mag , depending on the sample .",
    "astronomers have , however , learned in recent years to reduce this dispersion by making use of empirical correlations between the absolute peak luminosity and light curve shapes .",
    "examination of nearby sne showed that the peak brightness is correlated with the time scale of their brightening and fading : slow decliners tend to be brighter than rapid ones . using these and other correlations it became possible to reduce the remaining intrinsic dispersion , at least in the average , to @xmath20 .",
    "( for the various methods in use , and how they compare , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and references therein . ) other corrections , such as galactic extinction , have been applied , resulting for each supernova in a corrected ( rest - frame ) magnitude .",
    "after the classic papers @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite on the hubble diagram for high - redshift type ia supernovae , published by the scp and hzt teams , significant progress has been made ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the results , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , are based on additional data for @xmath21 , obtained in conjunction with the goods ( great observatories origins deep survey ) treasury program , conducted with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . in the meantime",
    "new results have been published .",
    "perhaps the best high-@xmath2 sn ia compilation to date are the results from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) of the first year @xcite .",
    "the other main research group has also published new data at about the same time @xcite . fig .",

    "cdm model model fit to the three - year wmap data only .",
    "( from fig .  8 of ref .  @xcite . ) [ cosmp : fig-3 ] ]    possible systematic uncertainties due to astrophysical effects have been discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "the most serious ones are ( i ) _ dimming _ by intergalactic dust , and ( ii ) _ evolution _ of sne ia over cosmic time , due to changes in progenitor mass , metallicity , and c / o ratio .    to improve the observational situation",
    "a satellite mission called snap ( `` supernovas acceleration probe '' ) has been proposed @xcite . according to the plans",
    "this satellite would observe about 2000 sne within a year and much more detailed studies could then be performed .",
    "for the time being some scepticism with regard to the results that have been obtained is still not out of place , but the situation is steadily improving .    finally , we point out a more theoretical complication . in the analysis of the data",
    "the luminosity distance for an ideal friedmann universe was always used .",
    "but the data were taken in the real inhomogeneous universe .",
    "the magnitude - redshift relation in a perturbed friedmann model has been derived in @xcite , and was later used to determine the angular power spectrum of the luminosity distance ( the @xmath22 s defined in analogy to ( [ eq : cmb1 ] ) ) @xcite .",
    "one of the numerical results was that the uncertainties in determining cosmological parameters via the magnitude - redshift relation caused by fluctuations are small compared with the intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitude of type ia supernovae .",
    "investigations of the cosmic microwave background have presumably contributed most to the remarkable progress in cosmology during recent years . beside its spectrum , which is planckian to an incredible degree , we also can study the temperature fluctuations over the `` cosmic photosphere '' at a redshift @xmath23 . through these",
    "we get access to crucial cosmological information ( primordial density spectrum , cosmological parameters , etc ) . a major reason for why this is possible relies on the fortunate circumstance that the fluctuations are tiny ( @xmath24 ) at the time of recombination .",
    "this allows us to treat the deviations from homogeneity and isotropy for an extended period of time perturbatively , i.e. , by linearizing the einstein and matter equations about solutions of the idealized friedmann - lematre models . since the physics is effectively _ linear _ , we can accurately work out the _ evolution _ of the perturbations during the early phases of the universe , given a set of cosmological parameters .",
    "confronting this with observations , tells us a lot about the cosmological parameters as well as the initial conditions , and thus about the physics of the very early universe . through this window to the earliest phases of cosmic evolution we can , for instance , test general ideas and specific models of inflation .",
    "we begin with some qualitative remarks .",
    "long before recombination ( at temperatures @xmath25 , say ) photons , electrons and baryons were so strongly coupled that these components may be treated together as a single fluid .",
    "in addition to this there is also a dark matter component . for all practical purposes the two interact only gravitationally .",
    "the investigation of such a two - component fluid for small deviations from an idealized friedmann behavior is a well - studied application of cosmological perturbation theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    at a later stage ,",
    "when decoupling is approached , this approximate treatment breaks down because the mean free path of the photons becomes longer ( and finally ` infinite ' after recombination ) .",
    "while the electrons and baryons can still be treated as a single fluid , the photons and their coupling to the electrons have to be described by the general relativistic boltzmann equation .",
    "the latter is , of course , again linearized about the idealized friedmann solution .",
    "together with the linearized fluid equations ( for baryons and cold dark matter , say ) , and the linearized einstein equations one arrives at a complete system of equations for the various perturbation amplitudes of the metric and matter variables .",
    "there exist widely used codes , e.g. cmbfast @xcite , that provide the cmb anisotropies  for given initial conditions  to a precision of about 1% .",
    "a lot of qualitative and semi - quantitative insight into the relevant physics can , however , be gained by looking at various approximations of the basic dynamical system .",
    "let us first discuss the temperature fluctuations .",
    "what is observed is the temperature autocorrelation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the angle between the two directions of observation @xmath28 , and the average is taken ideally over all sky .",
    "the _ angular power spectrum _ is by definition @xmath29c_l \\ ; \\ ; versus \\ ; \\;l \\ ; \\ ; ( \\vartheta \\simeq \\pi /l ) .$ ]    a characteristic scale , which is reflected in the observed cmb anisotropies , is the sound horizon at last scattering , i.e. , the distance over which a pressure wave can propagate until decoupling . this can be computed within the unperturbed model and subtends about half a degree on the sky for typical cosmological parameters . for scales larger than this sound horizon",
    "the fluctuations have been laid down in the very early universe .",
    "these have been detected by the cobe satellite .",
    "the ( gauge invariant brightness ) temperature perturbation @xmath30 is dominated by the combination of the intrinsic temperature fluctuations and gravitational redshift or blueshift effects .",
    "for example , photons that have to climb out of potential wells for high - density regions are redshifted .",
    "one can show that these effects combine for adiabatic initial conditions to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is one of the two gravitational bardeen potentials .",
    "the latter , in turn , is directly related to the density perturbations . for scale - free initial perturbations and almost vanishing spatial curvature",
    "the corresponding angular power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations turns out to be nearly flat ( sachs - wolfe plateau ) .    on the other hand , inside the sound horizon before decoupling , acoustic , doppler , gravitational redshift , and photon diffusion effects combine to the spectrum of small angle anisotropies shown in figure [ cosmp : fig-1 ] .",
    "these result from gravitationally driven synchronized acoustic oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid , which are damped by photon diffusion .    a particular realization of @xmath33 , such as the one accessible to us ( all sky map from our location ) , can not be predicted .",
    "theoretically , @xmath34 is a random field , @xmath35 , depending on the conformal time @xmath36 , the spatial coordinates @xmath37 , and the observing direction @xmath38 .",
    "its correlation functions should be rotationally invariant in @xmath38 , and respect the symmetries of the background time slices . if we expand @xmath39 in terms of spherical harmonics , @xmath40 the random variables @xmath41 have to satisfy @xmath42 where the @xmath43 depend only on @xmath36 .",
    "hence the correlation function at the present time @xmath44 is given by ( [ eq : cmb1 ] ) , where @xmath45 , and the bracket now denotes the statistical average .",
    "thus , @xmath46 the standard deviations @xmath47 measure a fundamental uncertainty in the knowledge we can get about the @xmath22 s",
    ". these are called _ cosmic variances _ , and are most pronounced for low @xmath48 . in simple inflationary models",
    "the @xmath41 are gaussian distributed , hence @xmath49 therefore , the limitation imposed on us ( only one sky in one universe ) is small for large @xmath48 .",
    "a polarization map of the cmb radiation provides important additional information to that obtainable from the temperature anisotropies .",
    "for example , we can get constraints about the epoch of reionization .",
    "most importantly , future polarization observations may reveal a stochastic background of gravity waves , generated in the very early universe .",
    "the polarization tensor of an all sky map of the cmb radiation can be parametrized in temperature fluctuation units , relative to the orthonormal basis @xmath50 of the two sphere , in terms of the pauli matrices as @xmath51 .",
    "the stokes parameter @xmath8 vanishes ( no circular polarization ) .",
    "therefore , the polarization properties can be described by a symmetric trace - free tensor on @xmath52 . as for gravity waves , the components @xmath53 and @xmath54 transform under a rotation of the 2-bein by an angle @xmath55 as @xmath56 , and are thus of spin - weight 2 .",

    "( [ eq : cmb2 ] ) the multipole moments @xmath59 and @xmath60 are random variables and determine , similar to ( [ eq : cmb1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cmb4 ] ) , the various angular correlation functions .",
    "in recent years several experiments gave clear evidence for multiple peaks in the angular temperature power spectrum at positions expected on the basis of the simplest inflationary models and big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite .",
    "these results have been confirmed and substantially improved by the first year wmap data @xcite , @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the improved data after three years of integration are now available @xcite . below",
    "we give a brief summary of some of the most important results .",
    "[ cosmp : fig-1 ] shows the 3-year data of wmap for the tt angular power spectrum , and the best fit ( power law ) @xmath19cdm model .",
    "the latter is a spatially flat model and involves the following six parameters : @xmath61 , amplitude of fluctuations , @xmath62 , optical depth , @xmath63 , and the spectral index , @xmath64 , of the primordial scalar power spectrum .",
    "[ cosmp : fig-2 ] shows in addition the te polarization data @xcite .",

    "( from fig .  10 in @xcite . )",
    "[ cosmp : fig-4 ] ]    the parameter space of the cosmological model can be extended in various ways . because of intrinsic degeneracies , the cmb data alone no more determine unambiguously the cosmological model parameters .",

    "it is most remarkable that a six parameter cosmological model is able to fit such a rich body of astronomical observations .",
    "there seems to be little room for significant modifications of the successful @xmath19cdm model .",
    "an exciting result is that the wmap data match the basic inflationary predictions , and are even well fit by the simplest model @xmath93 ( see sect",
    ". 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "if the vacuum energy constitutes the missing two thirds of the average energy density of the _ present _ universe , we would be confronted with the following _ cosmic coincidence _ problem : since the vacuum energy density is constant in time  at least after the qcd phase transition  , while the matter energy density decreases as the universe expands , it would be more than surprising if the two are comparable just at about the present time , while their ratio was tiny in the early universe and would become very large in the distant future .",
    "the goal of dynamical models of dark energy is to avoid such an extreme fine - tuning .",
    "the ratio @xmath94 of this component then becomes a function of redshift .    in a large class of dynamic dark energy models the exotic missing energy with negative pressure is described by a scalar field , whose potential is chosen such that the energy density of the homogeneous scalar field adjusts itself to be comparable to the matter density today for quite generic initial conditions , and is dominated by the potential energy .",
    "this ensures that the pressure becomes sufficiently negative .",
    "it is not simple to implement this general idea such that the model is phenomenologically viable .    for an extensive recent review that contains a description of a variety of scalar field models , see ref .",
    "it has to be emphasized that on the basis of the vacuum energy problem we would expect a huge additive constant for the quintessence potential that would destroy the hole picture .",
    "thus , assuming for instance that the potential approaches zero as the scalar field goes to infinity , has ( so far ) no basis .",
    "apart of this and other fine tuning problems , i doubt that this kind of phenomenological models  with no natural field theoretical justification  will lead to an understanding of dark energy at a deeper level .",
    "in the previous sections we have discussed some of the wide range of astronomical data that support the following ` concordance model ' : the universe is spatially flat and dominated by a dark energy component and weakly interacting cold dark matter .",
    "furthermore , the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic , nearly scale invariant and gaussian , as predicted in simple inflationary models .",
    "it is very likely that the present concordance model will survive phenomenologically .",
    "a dominant dark energy component with density parameter @xmath95 is so surprising that it should be examined whether this conclusion is really unavoidable . in",
    "what follows i shall briefly discuss some alternatives that have been proposed .",
    "since we do not have a tested theory predicting the spectrum of primordial fluctuations , it appears reasonable to consider a wider range of possibilities than simple power laws .",
    "an instructive attempt in this direction was made some time ago @xcite , by constructing an einstein - de sitter model with @xmath96 , fitting the cmb data as well as the power spectrum of 2dfgrs . in the meantime , significant improvements in astronomical data sets have been made .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the three year wmap data showed that there are no significant features in the primordial curvature fluctuation spectrum ( see sect .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with the larger samples of",
    "high redshift supernovae and more precise information on large scale galaxy clustering , such models with vanishing dark energy are no more possible @xcite .",
    "it has recently been suggested @xcite , @xcite that large scale perturbations may cause a large backreaction that could mimic dark energy and induce acceleration .",
    "the authors stressed that for investigating the effective dynamics averaging over a volume of size comparable with the present - day hubble volume is essential .",
    "to decide on the basis of detailed calculations whether this is indeed possible is a very difficult task .",
    "however , from what we know about the cmb radiation it appears unlikely that there are such sizable perturbations out to very large scales .    the work by kolb et al .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite triggered a lot of activity .",
    "we add some remarks about the ongoing discussion .",
    "effects of inhomogeneous matter distribution on light propagation were recently studied in the lematre - tolman ( lt ) model , in order to see whether these can mimic an accelerated expansion .",
    "the lt model is a family of spherically symmetric dust solutions of einstein s equations . for these the magnitude - redshift relation",
    "can be worked out exactly .    as an example we mention ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that for @xmath97 the observed behavior of supernovae brightness can not be fitted , unless our position in the model universe is very special . in that case one",
    "has to analyze also other data , in particular the cmb angular power spectrum . at the time of writing , this has not yet been done , but is certainly underway .",
    "since no satisfactory explanation of dark energy has emerged so far , possible modifications of gr , that would change the late expansion rate of the universe , have recently come into the focus of attention .",
    "the cosmic speed - up might , for instance , be explained by sub - dominant terms ( like @xmath98 ) that become essential at small curvature .",
    "modified gravity models have to be devised such that to pass the stringent solar system tests , and are compatible with the observational data that support the concordance model .",
    "the simplest generalization consists in replacing the ricci scalar , @xmath99 , in the einstein - hilbert action by a function @xmath100 .",
    "note that this gives rise to fourth - order field equations . applying a suitable conformal transformation of the metric",
    ", the action becomes equivalent to a scalar - tensor theory . in detail , if we define a new metric @xmath101 g_{\\mu\\nu},~\\kappa^2=8\\pi g$ ] , then the action becomes @xmath102-\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{g}^ { \\alpha\\beta}\\partial_\\alpha\\varphi\\partial_\\beta\\varphi -v(\\varphi ) + l_{matter}\\right]\\sqrt{-\\tilde{g}}d^4x , \\label{eq : alt10}\\ ] ] where the potential @xmath8 is determined by the function @xmath103 . with this formulation one can ,",
    "for instance , show that an arbitrary evolution of the scale factor @xmath104 can be obtained with an appropriate choice of @xmath100 .",
    "it is also useful to check whether a particular model passes solar system tests ( acceptable brans - dicke parameter ) .",
    "one should , however , bear in mind that the two mathematically equivalent descriptions lead to physically different properties , for instance with regard to stability . these issues and the application for specific functions @xmath103 to friedmann spacetimes ,",
    "have recently been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "we regard such modifications as quite ad hoc .",
    "moreover , it has not yet been demonstrated that there are examples which satisfy all the constraints stressed above .",
    "the same can be said on generalizations @xcite , that include other curvature invariants , such as @xmath105 .",
    "in addition , such models are in most cases _ unstable _ , like mechanical lagrangian systems with higher derivatives @xcite .",
    "an exception seem to be lagrangians which are functions of @xmath99 and the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath106 . by introducing two scalar fields",
    "such models can be written as an einstein - hilbert term plus a particular extra piece , containing a linear coupling to @xmath107 . because the gauss - bonnet invariant is a total divergence the corresponding field equations are of second order .",
    "this does , however , not guarantee that the theory is ghost - free . in ref .",
    "@xcite this question was studied for a class of models @xcite for which there exist accelerating late - time power - law attractors and which satisfy the solar system constraints .",
    "it turned out that in a friedman background there are no ghosts , but there is instead _ superluminal propagation _ for a wide range of parameter space .",
    "this acausality is reminiscent of the velo - zwanziger phenomenon @xcite for higher ( @xmath108 ) spin fields coupled to external fields .",
    "it may very well be that it can only be avoided if very special conditions are satisfied .",

    "furthermore , it has very recently been pointed out @xcite that due to superluminal fluctuations around non - trivial backgrounds , there is _ no local causal evolution_. this infrared breakdown also happens for other apparently consistent low - energy effective theories .",
    "it has been suggested by beck and mackey @xcite that part of the zero - point energy of the radiation field that is gravitationally active can be determined from noise measurements of josephson junctions .",
    "this caused some widespread attention . in a reaction we @xcite showed that there is no basis for this claim , by following the reasoning in @xcite for a much simpler model , for which it is very obvious that the authors misinterpreted their formulae .",
    "quite generally , the absolute value of the zero - point energy of a quantum mechanical system has no physical meaning when gravitational coupling is ignored .",
    "all that is measurable are _ changes _ of the zero - point energy under variations of system parameters or of external couplings , like an applied voltage .",
    "for further information on the controversy , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the previous discussion should have made it clear that it is extremely difficult to construct consistent modifications of gr that lead to an accelerated universe at late times .",
    "the dark energy problems will presumably stay with us for a long time .",
    "understanding the nature of de is widely considered as one of the main goals of cosmological research for the next decade and beyond ."
