    "rational ( also termed as non - polynomial oscillator , npo ) potentials are one of the most widely studied important model systems in quantum mechanics .",
    "the objective of this article is to investigate such potentials of the form , @xmath3 the schrdinger equation ( se ) can not be solved exactly in general and an impressive amount of theoretical works exist employing numerous formalisms as evident from a vast amount of literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has significance in nonlinear lagrangian methods in quantum field theory , laser physics , nonlinear optics , particle physics , etc .",
    "@xcite . obviously for @xmath4 or @xmath5 or @xmath6 or large @xmath7 , its solution behaves as the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the potential in 1d has attracted enormous attention from a large number of authors for nearly three decades employing several powerful tools such as variational method , perturbation theory ( pt ) , semi - numerical or purely numerical technique .",
    "_ exact _ analytical solutions of ground- and some excited - state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in 1d are possible provided @xmath7 and @xmath8 are related in certain specific ways @xcite .",
    "some of the most important works are chronologically : ritz variational principle using hermite polynomial basis @xcite , variational and pt calculations @xcite , pt using [ 6,6 ] pade approximation and hypervirial theorem @xcite , a variety of finite - difference approaches of different flavour @xcite , algebraic pt @xcite , combined supersymmetry and wkb approach @xcite , continued fraction method @xcite , analytic continuation method @xcite , pt with mixed hypervirial and hellmann - feynmann theory @xcite , hill - determinant method @xcite , variational bounds via rayleigh - ritz theorem @xcite , a quadrature discretization technique @xcite and purely numerical calculation @xcite , etc .",
    "some of these deal with only 1d and others for both 1d plus 3d and/or n dimensions .    in parallel to the 1d case , 3d npo has also been treated in significant detail in the past and recent years , and the interest continues to grow .",
    "_ exact _ solutions were reported for some special cases of @xmath7 and @xmath8 using susy @xcite , generalized harmonic oscillator form @xcite , etc . however since these are of limited applicability , several methodologies were attempted .",
    "some of the promising ones are : shifted 1/n expansion @xcite , bounds from eigenvalue moments method @xcite , hypervirial calculation @xcite , bounds through the envelope method @xcite .",
    "however as clear , 3d npo remains relatively less explored as compared to its 1d counterpart . amongst these , satisfactory results for _ arbitrary _ combination of potential parameters of a _ general _ state can be obtained only by a very few .",
    "thus while for 1d case , more than 10 decimal - place accuracy eigenvalues were reported in a number of papers ( for example @xcite , to our knowledge , only a few of the mentioned works @xcite are capable of delivering such results for 3d npo satisfying _ all _ these criteria .",
    "moreover two of these works in @xcite and @xcite deal mostly with estimate of the bounds , not the direct values .",
    "thus there is a scarcity of good - quality results for 3d npo as compared to that of 1d .",
    "it may be mentioned here that with the rare exception of @xcite , practically all works on 3d npo have focused on ( + ) ve @xmath8 , even though it has been known for long time that @xmath9 also offers well - behaved solutions provided @xmath100 .",
    "negative @xmath8 has been examined in 1d in detail @xcite , however .    in recent years",
    ", generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) method has witnessed great success and been proved to be a powerful , viable alternative for accurate and efficient treatment of a variety of potentials in quantum mechanics , such as the spiked harmonic oscillator , the power - law , the logarithmic , the hulthen , yukawa , etc .",
    ", as well as both static , dynamic properties of many - electron systems including multiply excited high - lying rydberg states of atoms @xcite-@xcite .",
    "successful applications have also been made for the 3d spherical confinement studies of the isotropic harmonic oscillator , the h atom and the davidson oscillator @xcite .",
    "a review of the gps method in the context of atomic and molecular calculations is available in @xcite .",
    "for some of the problems such as those in refs .",
    "@xcite , this has offered results either quite comparable to those obtained from the best available methods in the literature or has surpassed the existing calculations .",
    "another attractive feature is that it was very successful to furnish equally high - quality results for both lower and _ higher _ states , as well as for weaker and _ stronger _ interaction , which was not possible for many of the commonly used methodologies ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the gps method has not been applied in the context of npo so far .",
    "hence our first objective is to extend its scope and validity in the realm of this heavily studied important potential .",
    "as already hinted , we will treat both @xmath11 and @xmath12 with special attention to the higher - lying states . to this end ,",
    "calculated energies are presented for a wide range of @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "then the changes in energy are monitored with respect to the parameters .",
    "secondly we explore the possible patterns in energy orderings by systematically performing all the thirty states with varying @xmath13 and @xmath14 quantum numbers lying within @xmath2=09 for both ( + ) ve and ( @xmath15)ve @xmath8 .",
    "besides , it is known that the characteristic degeneracy of certain energy levels of the 3d harmonic oscillator is removed in certain situations ( in the limit of @xmath16 or @xmath17 , for example ) ; first four of such splittings have been discussed at length for ( + ) ve @xmath8 @xcite corresponding to @xmath2=04 . here",
    "we extend such an investigation for all the twenty differences possible within the range of @xmath18 for both ( + ) ve and ( @xmath15)ve @xmath8 as functions of the coupling parameters .",
    "comparison with literature data has been made wherever possible .",
    "section ii gives a brief account of the method of calculation .",
    "discussion on the results are given in section iii while a few concluding remarks are made in section iv .",
    "this section summarizes the essential details of gps formalism to solve the nonrelativistic radial se of a single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "relevant details have been presented elsewhere ( @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) ; thus not repeated . unless otherwise mentioned ,",
    "atomic units are employed throughout this article .",
    "the desired se can be written in following form , @xmath19 \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r ) = e_{n,\\ell}\\ \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath20 .",
    "a 1/2 factor is introduced for sake of consistency with the literature .",
    "the key step is to approximate a function @xmath21 defined in the interval @xmath22 $ ] by an n - th order polynomial @xmath23 such that , @xmath24 ensuring that the approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _",
    "@xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 in the legendre pseudospectral method used here , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , while @xmath29 are obtained from the roots of first derivative of the legendre polynomial @xmath30 with respect to @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 the cardinal functions @xmath33 given by , @xmath34 have the unique property , @xmath35 . now",

    "these were used for all the calculations reported in this work .",
    "usually @xmath44 was set at 150 , but for higher excitations larger values up to 300 a.u . was used ( see tables and section iii for details ) .",
    "the energies are given only up to the precision that maintained stability and are _ truncated _ rather than _ rounded - off_.    .[tab : table1]calculated lowest ( @xmath45 ) eigenvalues e ( times 2 in a.u . ) of the 3d npo for several @xmath7 and @xmath8 along with literature data for @xmath46 .",
    "asterisks denote exact analytical values @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 a.u .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     it is well - known that for a 3d harmonic oscillator @xmath13 and @xmath14 quantum numbers satisfying @xmath48 are degenerate .",
    "thus for @xmath2=4 , ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) pairs having values ( 2,0 ) , ( 1,2 ) and ( 0,4 ) are degenerate , etc . for non - zero @xmath8 ,",
    "such degeneracies vanish and these are conveniently analyzed through the respective level spacings , @xmath49 .",
    "quite detailed studies were conducted for first four ( @xmath504 ) such splittings of positive @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we found similar qualitative features for those in @xcite and thereby not repeated here .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no such attempts have been made as yet for @xmath510 .",
    "table v gives variations of all the first twelve such splittings possible between certain adjacent levels of @xmath2=27 with respect to the interaction parameters .",
    "first two splittings @xmath52 and @xmath53 belong to @xmath2=2,3 respectively , while the last three @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 correspond to @xmath2=7 . in columns 25 ,",
    "@xmath7 is kept fixed at 0.1 , while @xmath8 varied from @xmath150.1 to @xmath15100 .",
    "clearly all these splittings tend to increase as @xmath57 increases ; a trend as also observed for @xmath580 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , according to them the first four splittings , i.e. , the reverse of ours ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) increases continuously with @xmath8 , eventually approaching a constant value in the limit of @xmath63 .",
    "however they considered @xmath64 and more elaborate calculations would be required to confirm whether such a trend will also occur for @xmath510 .",
    "similar trend is observed for other @xmath7 as well as the remaining eight splittings ( not given ) occurring between certain permissible levels within @xmath2=8 and 9 .",
    "finally we examine the changes in spacings with respect to @xmath7 ( from 0.11000 ) , keeping @xmath8 fixed at @xmath15100 ( in columns 59 ) .",
    "thus the entries belonging to ( 0.1,@xmath15100 ) in column 5 are common to both the variations and hence enclosed in box with border from both sides .",
    "clearly they tend to disappear in the limit of large @xmath7 , in agreement with a conclusion found in @xcite for positive @xmath8 .",
    "once again , this has been found to be numerically true for the rest eight splittings occurring between higher levels ( not presented in the table ) as well as for other values of @xmath8 ( @xmath150.1,@xmath151,@xmath1510 ) .    before passing ,",
    "it may be noted that , in the last decade , the power series solution method ( originally proposed by @xcite ) and some of its variants have been very successful in producing quite accurate eigenvalues , radial expectation values , etc .",
    ", of a number of systems such as the confined 3d isotropic harmonic oscillator , 2d h atom confined in a circle with impenetrable walls , 3d h atom confined in an impenetrable sphere @xcite .",
    "very recently , highly accurate eigenvalues have also been reported @xcite by means of a formal solution of the confluent hypergeometric function for the confined h atom .",
    "it may be interesting to employ such methods in the context of the npos .",
    "quantum mechanics has nowadays widely spread applications almost everywhere in contemporary science and technology",
    ". however , exactly solvable quantum systems are very scarce . nearly exact numerical solutions of quantum - mechanical problems is of paramount interest in this vein , and also for the merits of the theory itself .",
    "this work offers nearly exact solutions for a specific class of quantum potentials , the non - polynomial oscillator class , that has broad applications in various quantum and quantum - field models .",
    "accurate bound states of the 3d npo are calculated and considered in detail . while several high - quality results have been published for the 1d npo ,",
    "the data for 3d npo is quite limited .",
    "reliable variational bounds have become available only very recently .",
    "moreover , the @xmath650 region is explored very little . for both positive and negative @xmath8 , as well as for far high - lying states ,",
    "the present gps calculations match very well with the best literature results .",
    "all levels in the range of @xmath2=09 ( comprising thirty overall ) are investigated for a wide range of the coupling parameters .",
    "this study surpasses all the existing results except the finite - difference data of ref .",
    "@xcite , which offers similar accuracy .",
    "energy and radial density distribution variations are followed as functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "an attempt is made to identify the energy orderings for @xmath510 and @xmath660 separately .",
    "although there seems to be a qualitative pattern , several deviations of oscillatory character to it are observed .",
    "finally all the twenty energy differences between certain admissible levels for @xmath2=09 are examined for the first time as functions of the parameters .",
    "the method employed here is simple , easily applies to a wide variety of strong and weak interactions and performs very well for low and higher excitations .",
    "we hope that our results may serve as benchmarks for these potentials .",
