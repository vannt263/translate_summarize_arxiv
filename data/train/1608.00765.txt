    "_ bump - hunting _ , i.e. searching for bumps in invariant mass spectra , is perhaps the best way to look for resonances at particle colliders .",
    "such an approach is fairly model independent and in the limit of small bins and large statistics allows one to unambiguously discover and accurately map a resonance .",
    "moreover , in this limit no detailed understanding of the relevant background is required which is a welcome feature given backgrounds are often poorly predicted .    while extremely powerful , bump - hunting search strategies have their limitations , too .",
    "the main one is limited statistics .",
    "while still an important factor in many searches , the data taking ability of the lhc will soon render statistical errors irrelevant in many cases . in the long run , especially with the high - luminosity lhc phase",
    ", statistics will become non - issue for most current searches . a second , _ irreducible _ bump - hunting limitation is finite bin size , which is introduced by statistics - independent factors like detector resolution and unfolding . because of these limitations , a straightforward application of the bump - hunting approach , as described above , is not always possible .",
    "in such cases having high - precision background predictions could be very valuable .    in this work we elaborate on a search strategy for possible resonances decaying to @xmath1 final states which fully utilises the knowledge of the background with high precision ( @xmath1 in this case ) .",
    "to make our discussion less abstract we will consider the case of the @xmath5 di - gamma excess @xcite . this possible deviation from the standard model ( sm ) has triggered enormous interest and activity in direction of explaining it through beyond the sm physics ( bsm ) ; see the recent review @xcite for detailed cover of the existing bsm literature .",
    "we would like to stress that the approach considered in this work is general and can be adapted for different kinematics . when framed , as an example , in the context of the 750 gev di - gamma excess ,",
    "the questions we address in this work are : if the observed di - gamma excess is due to the decay of an unknown particle @xmath6 , could it also be observed in @xmath1 data at lhc 13 tev ? and",
    "if not observed , then how powerful a limit can be placed on the possible decay rate @xmath4 ?",
    "the current data suggest that the resonance @xmath2 is most likely spin zero , has width around @xmath7 or less and mass around @xmath5 .",
    "model dependence aside , we assume that @xmath2 can decay to @xmath1 , which is allowed kinematically . a detailed analysis of the process",

    "@xcite . given the smoothness of the differential distribution in this @xmath0 range , as well as the small mc error of the underlying binned calculation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) it is natural to derive such a fit .",
    "most importantly , an analytic fit allows one to subsequently derive binned distributions with any bin size , or bin position , and we will explore both possibilities in the following .",
    "we fit separately the central prediction as well as the lower and upper edges in each bin .",
    "we repeat this procedure for lo , nlo and nnlo bands in the cases of absolute normalisation as well as the two normalisations to be introduced shortly . to ensure smoothness of the fit",
    ", we perform it over the wider range @xmath16 although the fit is only meant to be used in the range @xmath10 .    in all cases",
    "the fits take the functional form : @xmath17 the fit coefficients @xmath18 are available in electronic form with the arxiv submission of this paper .",
    "the quality of the fits is such that the relative scatter of the actual calculation with respect to its fit is between 0.2% and 0.7% for all bins in the interval @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the scatter is consistent with both being random and with the estimated mc error .    in the following",
    "we detail the most important sources of theory error and how we deal with them .",
    "scale error is estimated through independent scale variation , as usual .",
    "we believe that in the @xmath10 range scale variation is a good estimator of missing higher order effects , because in this intermediate @xmath0 range neither absolute threshold coulomb effects nor collinear log resummation play a role .",
    "soft - gluon resummation might have an effect but following the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite we expect that resummation effects , when properly matched to the nnlo calculation used in the present work , should be within the nnlo scale error estimate .",
    "pdf error should also be under good control in this @xmath0 range .",
    "a detailed analysis @xcite shows that there is a good overlap between various state - of - the - art pdf sets . by taking nnpdf3.0 as our default",
    "set we likely have a conservative estimate of the pdf error .",
    "electroweak ( ew ) corrections contribute little in this @xmath0 range .",
    "utilising the recent work @xcite , a detailed analysis of mixed nnlo qcd and ew corrections in top production @xcite shows that the @xmath0 distribution is slightly lowered by ew corrections ( by about 1 - 2% ) .",
    "such an effect is negligible in the unnormalised @xmath0 distribution .",
    "we have checked that ew effects are reduced to below 0.3% in the normalised distributions to be defined next , and so we neglect them in the following .",
    "another subtle source of theory error is the value of the top quark mass . with a direct calculation at lo and nlo",
    "we estimate that a @xmath19 change in @xmath20 ( with respect to @xmath9 ) shifts the differential cross - section around @xmath21 by about 1% .",
    "since the error of the current @xmath20 world average is well below @xmath19 @xcite it may appear that the @xmath20 systematics is not important .",
    "there are two indications , however , that this may not be the case .",
    "first , there is a spread of around @xmath22 between independent precise measurements of @xmath20 @xcite ( a recent summary of lhc measurements can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) which , when coupled with the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite , indicates that robust control over the @xmath20 systematics is prudent in the present context .",
    "second , the @xmath20 systematics may play an outsized role in the normalised @xmath0 distribution . to aid the following discussion",
    "we introduce the normalised @xmath0 differential distribution parametrised by the normalisation factor @xmath15 : @xmath23 of interest to us will be the following normalisation factors : @xmath24 a quick check shows that in the @xmath0 range around @xmath21 the usual normalised distribution @xmath25 has twice the @xmath20 sensitivity of the unnormalised distribution @xmath26 . since both scale and pdf errors get strongly reduced in normalised distributions , see below , the @xmath20 sensitivity may turn out to be a leading theoretical systematics for @xmath25 in this @xmath0 range . for this reason we will not consider the @xmath25 distribution in this work .",
    "it turns out that in order to minimise the @xmath20 sensitivity in the relevant for this work portion of the @xmath0 spectrum , we need to normalise the differential spectrum to the inclusive cross - section based on @xmath0 values just below the range we are interested in .",
    "to be specific , in this work we consider the two normalisations @xmath27 and @xmath28 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) .",
    "the reasons behind choosing their ranges are as follows .",
    "we consider as upper limit @xmath29 because this is the lower end of the window @xmath30 where we intend to search for @xmath4 decays .",
    "assuming @xmath31 and @xmath32 we do not expect to have much pure bsm signal below @xmath33 ( the interference with the sm @xmath34 background , however , does contribute - see below ) .",
    "there are two competing demands when trying to decide on the size of the normalisation window .",
    "a larger normalisation interval would , presumably , minimise experimental errors . on the other hand",
    ", a smaller normalisation interval will lead to smaller sensitivity to @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , with a direct lo and nlo calculations , we have estimated that the @xmath20 sensitivity of the distributions @xmath35 and @xmath36 is much reduced in the interval around @xmath21 : it is below @xmath37 per @xmath38 for @xmath35 and around @xmath39 per @xmath38 for @xmath36 .",
    "additionally , the error due to @xmath40 should also be strongly reduced in these two normalised distributions compared to the unnormalised one . in this work we have not further investigated the sensitivity to @xmath40 .",
    "next we address the properties of the normalised distributions eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm - dist ] ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtt - abs ] .",
    "the main feature of the normalised distributions is their strongly reduced scale and pdf variation . indeed , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : mtt - abs ] the combined scale and pdf error for the case @xmath41 is about 1% while for @xmath42 it is only around half that , i.e. 0.5% . as it is often the case in such normalised observables , such strong reduction in the error estimate",
    "is driven by the fact that scale and pdf variations are performed in a correlated way for the numerator and denominator in the normalised distribution .",
    "in other words in order to determine the scale variation one computes the numerator and denominator for the same choice of scales and then studies the variation of the ratio .",
    "similarly for the pdf error .",
    "one may wonder if such a strong reduction in scale and pdf variation , which is the result of a consistent theoretical calculation , properly reflects the error on the ratio itself .",
    "past examples , notably the top - pair forward - backward asymmetry through nnlo @xcite , show that error estimates of ratios may be more delicate than for standard observables and one should be alerted to the possibility for underestimating theoretical errors in ratios .",
    "while in general we share such concerns , in this specific case we anticipate that the scale and pdf error estimates given above are reliable .",
    "this can be justified with the @xmath43-factors shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtt - abs ] . unlike the unnormalised distribution @xmath26",
    "which has large nlo and nnlo @xmath43-factors , the normalised distributions @xmath35 and @xmath36 have extremely small @xmath43-factors , at or below 1% , for both nlo and nnlo .",
    "furthermore , as also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : mtt - abs ] , the scale plus pdf error is consistent with the nlo and nnlo @xmath43-factors .",
    "as we mentioned above , we utilise the @xmath4 signal as well as the signal - background interference as calculated in ref .  @xcite . specifically , we take the model specified in table 9 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a scalar @xmath2 with production cross - section @xmath44 .",
    "we combine our calculation of the qcd @xmath1 background with the bsm signal by simply adding the non - qcd contributions computed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( pure signal plus signal - background interference ) to the pure qcd background . while this procedure is formally correct , some small inconsistencies are present .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite uses @xmath45 ( we use @xmath9 ) ; lo calculation of the sm background with dynamic scale @xmath46 ( we use scale @xmath47 ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) ; pdf set mmht2014 @xcite ( we use nnpdf3.0 ) .",
    "given the exploratory nature of this work , however , such inconsistencies are unlikely to play a role into the conclusions drawn in the following .",
    "distribution computed in nnlo qcd ( blue band ) versus nnlo qcd plus the @xmath4 contribution .",
    "three different bin sizes are used : @xmath48 ( left ) , @xmath49 ( centre ) and @xmath50 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]    distribution computed in nnlo qcd ( blue band ) versus nnlo qcd plus the @xmath4 contribution .",

    "[ fig : mtt - abs - binned ] we show the complete sm+bsm contribution to the unnormalised @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "we consider bins of three sizes : @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "of relevance for experimental analyses is only the @xmath50 bin size since , to our knowledge , this is the minimum bin size that will be possible in this @xmath0 range due to resolution constraints .",
    "nevertheless , smaller bin sizes provide insight into the precise behaviour of signal and background .",
    "the same plots but for the normalised @xmath0 distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtt - norm - binned ] : for @xmath36 ( upper row ) and for @xmath35 ( lower row ) . in order to be able to study variable bin sizes and positions ,",
    "we have derived analytical fits for the pure bsm signal and sm - bsm interference which were computed for fixed bin sizes in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the contribution of the interference between bsm signal and sm background to the normalisation factors @xmath52 is around 1% and is included in the normalisation factor for the sm+bsm case ( but , of course , it is not in the calculation of the pure sm background and normalisation ) .",
    "the monte carlo error of the normalisation factors is of particular concern since it shift up / down the whole distribution and such an error can not be detected by the usual smoothness requirement ( which only helps identify bin - to - bin mc fluctuations ) .",
    "we estimate the mc error of the normalisation factors directly form our calculation and find it to be below 0.2% .",
    "such error is insignificant and we will neglect it in the following .    in all plots in figs .",

    "the bin position is especially relevant for bsm contributions with a peak - dip structure : after repositioning , a bin of fixed size can show positive , negative or no deviation from the sm background . since the minimum size of the @xmath0 bins is expected to be around @xmath50 , i.e. larger than the expected @xmath2 width , the only way to unambiguously resolve such complicated structure is by using sliding bins . to that end in fig .

    "interestingly , the significance of the deviation in the negative direction caused by the interference dip may be large enough to be detectable in normalised distributions .",
    "finally , we would like to estimate the minimal rate for the process @xmath53 that could be discriminated from the sm background . in studying this we make the simplifying assumption that the shapes of pure signal and interference remain unchanged and only the overall rate changes .",
    "this assumption is roughly consistent with the models considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : significance ] we observe that for an optimally positioned bin , one can detect with a significance of about 3 a signal with rate @xmath53 that is as low as @xmath55 for normalisation @xmath41 and @xmath53 that is as low as @xmath56 if normalisation @xmath42 is chosen .",
    "in this work we quantify the possibility for discriminating bsm signals of the type @xmath57 from the sm @xmath1 background at the lhc 13 tev by looking for bumps in the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "we have found that purposefully normalised @xmath0 spectra , computed at nnlo qcd , have small associated theoretical error and can be used as an effective tool for bump - hunting in @xmath1 events .",
    "an important property of such normalised distributions is their relatively small sensitivity to the value of the top quark mass .    to keep the discussion less abstract , as an example ,",

    "looking beyond the possible @xmath5 resonance @xmath2 , our work is designed to be a blueprint into future search strategies for possible resonances decaying to @xmath1 and it can easily be adapted to other kinematic regions . in particular , having high - precision background predictions can be very valuable in designing search strategies in cases where expected bump widths are comparable or smaller than the minimum possible bin size . we expect that our work will offer new insight into designing search strategies in @xmath1 events and will complement and support existing sophisticated bump - hunting statistical techniques and tools @xcite .",
