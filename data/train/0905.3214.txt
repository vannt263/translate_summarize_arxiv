    "quantum communications and quantum computation apply quantum states to store and transmit information .",
    "the capacity of a state for the purpose is dependent on its dimension , so the higher dimension of a state means the higher capacity to carry information .",
    "in addition , the use of higher dimensional quantum states , e.g. , qudits and entangled qudits , enjoys many advantages such as enhanced security in quantum cryptography @xcite , more efficient quantum logic gate @xcite and others .",
    "qudits and entangled qudits therefore attract many researches recently .",
    "the proposals for generating qudits and entangled qudits include orbital angular momentum entangled qutrits @xcite , pixel entangled qudits @xcite , energy - time entangled and time - bin entangled qudits @xcite , and bi - photonic qutrits encoded with polarization degree of freedom @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on bi - photonic qutrits which are represented with the polarizations of two photons in the same spatial - temporal mode @xcite@xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denotes the horizontal and vertical polarization , respectively .",
    "the generation of such qutrits including the entangled ones has been demonstrated @xcite . in an recent work by lanyon , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , with an ancilla qubit and a fock state filter associated with some wave plates , a bi - photonic state as the linear combination of @xmath6 is generated from the logic state @xmath7 . to manipulate a bi - photonic qutrit in this form",
    ", one should know how to implement a unitary operation on such qutrits .",
    "however , due to the indistinguishableness of two photons in the same spatial - temporal mode , it is very difficult to realize a simple unitary operation on such bi - photonic qutrit @xcite .",
    "here we present two schemes realizing the transformation from a bi - photonic qutrit to any other bi - photonic qutrit , i. e. , arbitrary unitary operations @xmath0 on bi - photonic qutrits .",
    "the schemes work with transforming the input bi - photonic qutrits to the corresponding single photon qutrits in spatial modes , and then mapping the single photon qutrits back to the original polarization modes of two photons .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a purely linear optical scheme of the transformation and inverse transformation from a bi - photonic qutrit in the same spatial - temporal mode to the corresponding single photon qutrit . in sec .",
    "iii , we improve on the linear optical scheme with weak cross - kerr nonlinearity , making the realization of bi - directional mapping much more efficient . sec .",
    "iv concludes the work with a brief discussion .",
    "any unitary operation on a single photon qudits in spatial modes can be performed by a linear optical multi - port interferometer ( lomi ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible to manipulate bi - photonic qutrits following such strategy  first transforms a bi - photonic qutrit to a single - photon qutrit , and then performs the desired operations on this single photon qutrit , and finally transforms the single photon qutrit back to a bi - photonic qutrit . in what follows ,",
    "we present the details of the procedure , which is realized only with linear optical elements .",
    "suppose a bi - photonic qutrit is initially prepared as @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the operations shown in fig . 1 implements the map @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a single - photon qutrit encoded with the spatial modes @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of the single photon .",

    "next , in order to project out the proper components , we introduce two single photons @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the ancilla , and make them interfere with the output modes of the polarizing beam splitters ( pbs@xmath21 ) on two 50:50 beam splitters ( bs ) , respectively . due to the hong - ou - mandal interference effect @xcite",
    ", two indistinguishable photon will be bunching to the same output mode of bs , and then we can use the proper post - selection to get the desired components . to see the details ,",
    "we show the evolution of each input mode of two photons as follows : @xmath22 where the subscripts @xmath23 denote the modes going to photon number non - resolving detectors .",
    "meanwhile , for the ancilla photons , the evolutions are @xmath24 the 50:50 bs placed on path 4 ( 5 ) is to split the mode 4 ( 5 ) into two output modes 6 , p@xmath25 ( 7 , p@xmath26 ) , making the transformations , @xmath27 after that , one obtains the following state : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the components of two photons appearing in the same spatial mode .",
    "if we discard the modes @xmath30 without changing anything else , i.e. , erase the path information of @xmath30 , the first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ sq ] ) will be just the desired single photon qutrit , which carries the same coefficients of the input bi - photon qutrit .",
    "since there is only one photon in the modes @xmath30 , we will use a quantum fourier transform ( qft ) ( @xmath31 denote the spatial modes ) @xcite , @xmath32 to do it .",
    "the qft is an unitary operation for a single photon in three spatial modes , so we can use an lomi shown in the dashed line of fig . 1 to implement it",
    "just like the setups in the dash - dotted line , three photon number non - resolving detectors are used and the detection results are to control the conditional phase shift ( ps ) through classical feedforward .",

    "assocaited with the above transformation , we could manipulate the bi - photonic qutrits , such as perform an arbitrary unitary operation @xmath0 on them , with a success probability @xmath70 .",
    "the scheme succeeds with a very small probability , but in principle it can realize any unitary operation on a bi - photon qutrit .    in summary , with four ancilla single photons , we could realize arbitrary manipulation with linear optical elements and coincidence measurements . since only two cases  no photon or any number of photons  should be discriminated , the common photon number non - resolving detector , e.g. , silicon avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) will be necessary for the scheme .",
    "the success probability of the above scheme with only linear optical elements could be too small for practical application .",

    "similar to the process in fig .",
    "3 , we can achieve the final single photon qutrit @xmath112 with the success probability @xmath113 though this design requires the post - selection , it dispenses with the xpm phase shift of @xmath99 , so it could be more experimentally feasible .",
    "now we should transform the output single photon qutrit back to a bi - photonic qutrit .",

    "the target output could be therefore obtained by the projection @xmath109 on the first qubus beam . if @xmath110 , we will obtain @xmath125 with the polarization of ancilla photon the same to the single photon qutrit .",
    "if @xmath126 , on the other hand , there will be the output @xmath127 which can be transformed to the form in eq .",

    "similar to the first entangler , the second implements the transformation @xmath130 also we need to erase the path information of the first photon .",
    "we first combine the modes 1 and 2 by a pbs , and then make them interfere with the mode 0 through a 50:50 bs to achieve the following state @xmath131 by two pbs@xmath111 , the state @xmath132 will be then obtained . with four detectors on path 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as well as the classical feedforward ,",

    "the above processes could be deterministic .",
    "the final step is to merge the two photons into the same spatial mode , which could be simply realized by a bs and the following qnd module . in this qnd module , a qubus beam @xmath134",

    "the different coefficients between the mid term and the other two terms in eqs .",
    "( [ out-1 ] ) and ( [ out-3 ] ) are caused by the hong - ou - mandal ( hom ) interference effect on bs@xmath21 . in order to balance the coefficients",
    ", we should use a 50:50 bs respectively on path 0 and 2 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "after that we could achieve the bi - photonic qutrit @xmath68 with the success probability @xmath114 , and then the total success probability for an arbitrary unitary operation on biphoton qutrits will be @xmath139 .",
    "we have presented two schemes for unitary operations on biphoton qutrits , which are realized through bi - directional mapping between polarization and spatially encoded photonic qutrits . through the bi - directional mapping",
    "any unitary operation @xmath0 on bi - photonic qutrits can be reduced to that on single photon qutrits .",
    "the linear optical scheme succeeds with a small probability @xmath140 , but it can be increased to @xmath141 with weak cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "the probabilistic nature of the schemes is due to the two indistinguishable photons in the same spatial - temporal modes .",
    "for example , at the last merging step in fig . 5 , the probability to get the proper output state will be lowered by @xmath142 because of the hom interference .    finally , we look at the feasibility of the schemes .",
    "the first scheme applies common experimental tools such as linear optical circuits , coincidence measurements , and detection with apds .",
    "the difficulty in the implementation is the accuracy for the numerous interferences between the photonic modes .",
    "the additional requirement in the second scheme is the good performance of weak cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "the error in each xpm process can be effectively eliminated under the condition @xmath143 @xcite , which means that the small xpm phase @xmath105 can be compensated by the large amplitude @xmath144 of the qubus or communication beams .",
    "the other advantage of the scheme based on weak nonlinearity is the fewer ancilla photons  the ancilla photons are only required in the inverse transformation .",
    "this could make the experimental implementation more simplified .",
