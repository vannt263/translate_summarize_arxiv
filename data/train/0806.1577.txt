    "co - operative diversity is proved to be an efficient means of achieving spatial diversity in wireless networks without the need of multiple antennas at the individual nodes . in comparison with single user colocated multiple antenna transmission ,",
    "co - operative communication is based on the relay channel model where a set of distributed antennas belonging to multiple users in the network co - operate to encode the signal transmitted from the source and forward it to the destination so that the required diversity order is achieved @xcite .",
    "+ in @xcite , the idea of space - time coding devised for point to point co - located multiple antenna systems is applied for a wireless relay network with single antenna nodes and pep ( pairwise error probability ) of such a scheme was derived .",
    "it is shown that in a relay network with a single source , a single destination with @xmath0 single antenna relays , distributed space time coding ( dstc ) achieves the diversity of a colocated multiple antenna system with @xmath0 transmit antennas and one receive antenna , asymptotically .",
    "+ subsequently , in @xcite , the idea of @xcite is extended to relay networks where the source , the destination and the relays have multiple antennas .",
    "but , co - operation between the multiple antennas of each relay is not used , i.e. , the colocatedness of the antennas is not exploited .",
    "hence , a total of @xmath0 relays each with a single antenna is assumed in the network instead of a total of @xmath0 antennas in a smaller number of relays . with this set up , for a network with @xmath5 antennas at the source , @xmath6 antennas at the destination and a total of @xmath0 antennas at @xmath0 relays , for large values of @xmath4 , the pep of the network , varies with @xmath4 as    @xmath7    in particular , the pep of the scheme in @xcite for large @xmath4 when specialized to @xmath8 with 2@xmath0 antennas at relays is upper - bounded by ,    @xmath9^{2r}\\left[\\frac{(\\mbox{log}_{e}(p))^{2r}}{p^{2r}}\\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the minimum singular value of @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the two distinct codewords of a distributed space time block code and @xmath4 is the total power per channel use used by all the relays for transmitting an information vector . + following the work of @xcite , constructions of distributed space time block codes for networks with multiple antenna nodes are presented in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we refer cooperative diversity schemes in which multiple antennas of a relay do not co - operate i.e when the transmitted vector from every antenna is function of only the received vector in that antenna , or when every relay has only one antenna as regular distributed space - time coding ( rdstc ) .",
    "+ the key idea in the proposed scheme is the notion of vector coordinate interleaving defined below :    [ def1 ] given two complex vectors @xmath14 we define a coordinate interleaved vector pair of @xmath15 denoted as @xmath16 to be the pair of complex vectors @xmath17 where @xmath18 given by @xmath19 or equivalently , @xmath20",
    "@xmath21    the notion of coordinate interleaving of two complex variables has been used in @xcite to obtain single - symbol decodable stbcs with higher rate than the well known complex orthogonal designs .",
    "definition [ def1 ] is an extension of the above technique to two complex vectors .",
    "the idea of vector co - ordinate interleaving has been used in @xcite in order to obtain better diversity results in fast fading mimo channels .    in this paper , we show that multiple antennas at the relays can be exploited to improve the performance of the network . towards this end , a single antenna source and a single antenna destination with two antennas at each of the @xmath0 relays",
    "is considered .",
    "also , the two phase protocol as in @xcite is assumed where the first phase consists of transmission of a @xmath1 length complex vector from the source to all the relays ( not to the destination ) and the second phase consists of transmission of a @xmath1 length complex vector from each of the antennas of the relays to the destination , as shown in fig.[model ] .",
    "the modification in the protocol we introduce is that the two received vectors at the two antennas of a relay during the first phase is coordinate interleaved as defined in definition [ def1 ] .",
    "then , multiplying the coordinate interleaved vector with the predecided antenna specific @xmath22 unitary matrices , each antenna produces a @xmath1 length vector that is transmitted to the destination in the second phase .",
    "the collection of all such vectors , as columns of a @xmath23 matrix constitutes a codeword matrix and collection of all such codeword matrices is referred as coordinate interleaved distributed space time code ( cidstc ) .",
    "the contributions of this paper may be summarized as follows in more specific terms :    * for @xmath2 , an upper bound on the pep of our scheme with fully diverse cidstc , at large values of the total power @xmath4 is derived . * for @xmath24 the pep of the rdstc scheme in @xcite with fully diverse dstbc is upper bounded by the expression given in . comparing this bound , with ours , for equal number of @xmath3 antennas , a term @xmath25^{r}$ ] appears in the numerator of the pep expression of our scheme instead of the term @xmath25^{2r}$ ] .",
    "this improvement in the pep comes just by vector co - ordinate interleaving at every relay the complexity of which is negligible .",
    "* it is shown that cidstc scheme provides asymptotic coding gain compared to the corresponding rdstc scheme .",
    "* cidstc in variables @xmath26 is shown not to provide full diversity if the variables @xmath26 take values from any 2-dimensional signal set .",
    "* multi - dimensional signal sets are shown to provide full diversity for cidstcs whose choice depends on the design in use . *",
    "the number of channel uses needed in the proposed scheme is at least @xmath27 where as only @xmath3 is needed in an rdstc scheme . with @xmath28 for both the schemes , through simulation , it is shown that cidstc gives improved ber ( bit error rate ) performance over that of rdstc scheme .    _",

    "<S> a new class of distributed space time block codes called co - ordinate interleaved distributed space - time codes ( cidstc ) are introduced where , in the first phase , the source transmits a @xmath1-length complex vector to all the relays and in the second phase , at each relay , the in - phase and quadrature component vectors of the received complex vectors at the two antennas are interleaved and processed before forwarding them to the destination . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the scheme proposed by jing - hassibi , for @xmath2 , while providing the same asymptotic diversity order of @xmath3 , cidstc scheme is shown to provide asymptotic coding gain with the cost of negligible increase in the processing complexity at the relays . however , for moderate and large values of @xmath4 , cidstc scheme is shown to provide more diversity than that of the scheme proposed by jing - hassibi . </S>",
