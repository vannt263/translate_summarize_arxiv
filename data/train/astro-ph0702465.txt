    "magnetic fields play a role , sometimes pivotal , in the evolution and dynamics of astrophysical objects .",
    "these include , but are not limited to , molecular clouds , protostars , stellar and planetary dynamos , pulsars , jets from active galactic nuclei , the solar wind , solar flares , the earth s and sun s magnetosheaths , and , importantly , accretion disks of all kinds .",
    "to investigate these environments theoretically has often required multi - dimensional simulation tools that in the past have incorporated the relevant physics only to varying degrees .",
    "ideal _ mhd ( magnetohydrodynamic ) approximation , in which it is assumed the electrical conductivity of the fluid is  infinite \" and , therefore , that the magnetic flux is frozen in the matter , is a very good one in many environments in the universe and obviates the necessity to solve separate boltzmann equations with microscopic couplings for the various charged components .",
    "recently , core - collapse supernova explosions and gamma - ray bursts have been added to the list of astrophysical sites in which magnetic fields might play an important role . in this paper",
    ", we describe a new 2.5-dimensional mhd algorithm ( now incorporated into the radiation hydrodynamic code vulcan/2d ) that maintains the divergence - free character of the b - field to machine precision and applies to general structured and unstructured grids .",
    "we were motivated in developing this new capability by the intriguing possibility that magnetic fields might play a dynamical role in the mechanism of gamma - ray bursts and , possibly , in the explosions of a subset of core - collapse supernovae , as well as by an interest in the origin of pulsar and magnetar b - fields .",
    "nevertheless , the new code can be used for a much wider set of problems , since along with rotation and magnetic fields in the _ ideal _ mhd approximation it also incorporates multi - group transport ( in both the multi - angle s@xmath2 and flux - limited diffusion approximations ) and a general gravity solver .",
    "the possibility of hydromagnetic driving of supernova explosions was first explored quantitatively by leblanc & wilson ( 1970 ) . using numerical simulations that were then the state - of - the - art",
    ", they showed that the combination of rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields in the pre - collapse core could lead to the formation of bipolar jets in the post - bounce configuration . in that picture ,",
    "magnetic fields convert rotational energy into the jet energy via the pinch effect .",
    "the old simulations of leblanc & wilson , however , suffered from crude spatial resolution and did not incorporate important developments in the physics of nuclear matter and in the neutrino - matter interaction .",
    "they employed gray transport and obtained rather weak explosions near @xmath310@xmath4 ergs .",
    "after this pioneering work , with few exceptions ( bisnovatyi - kogan et al .",
    "1976 ; meier et al . 1976",
    "; symbalisty 1984 ) , the possible role of magnetic fields in powering or enabling supernova explosions took a back seat to other promising mechanisms .",
    "however , recently the subject of hydromagnetic interactions during core collapse has been revived by a number of investigators ( akiyama et al .",
    "2003 ; ardeljan et al . 2005 ; yamada & sawai 2004 ; kotake et al .",
    "2004 ; ohnishi , kotake , & yamada 2005 ; akiyama & wheeler 2005 ; proga 2005 ; wilson , mathews , & dalhed 2005 ; thompson , quataert , & burrows 2005 ; moiseenko et al .",
    "2006 ; uzdensky & macfadyen 2006ab ; masada , sano , & shibata 2006 ) , who have investigated the potential of magnetic stresses , magnetic buoyancy , magnetic collimation , magnetic dissipation , and the magnetorotational instability ( mri , balbus & hawley 1991 ; akiyama et al .",
    "2003 ; pessah & psaltis 2005 ; pessah , chan & psaltis 2006 ; obergaulinger , aloy , & mller 2006 ; etienne , liu , & shapiro 2006 ) to power explosion .",
    "in addition , the possibility that magnetic fields generated during black hole or neutron star formation might form energetic jets in the context of gamma - ray bursts , x - ray flashes , collapsars ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , and hypernovae is receiving increasing attention ( e.g. , mizuno et al . 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , the potential role of magnetic winds in powering explosions , or secondary explosions , and in spinning down the nascent neutron star or magnetar is now being actively studied ( thompson ,  chang ,  &  quataert 2004 ; bucciantini et al .",
    "2006 ; metzger , thompson , & quataert 2006 ) . in all these scenarios , rapid rotation and the growth of strong magnetic fields due to compression , winding , and/or the mri during the dynamical phases of",
    "core collapse play essential roles . whether progenitors boast",
    "the requisite rotation and initial seed fields remains to be determined ( heger et al .",
    "2004 ; heger , woosley , & spruit 2005 ) , but an interesting subset surely must .    to date",
    ", there has been a great deal of mhd code development in astrophysics , mainly focused on simulating turbulent magnetic molecular clouds , accretion disks , agn jets , solar and stellar dynamos , and solar plasmas , but lately also on the question of gamma - ray bursts and supernovae .",
    "stone & norman ( 1992ab ) developed the zeus suite of codes that employs the method of characteristics ( moc ) to properly address mhd waves and incorporates the constrained transport ( ct ) method ( evans & hawley 1988 ) to handle the divergence condition on the b - field .",
    "it includes gray radiation transport using a short - characteristics method .",
    "dai and woodward ( 1994 ) developed an mhd riemann solver and extended the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) to multidimensional mhd equations .",
    "they also presented a ppm variant that exactly preserves the conservation laws of magnetohydrodynamics together with the divergence - free condition ( dai & woodward 1998 ) .",
    "gardiner & stone ( 2005 ) have followed zeus / mhd with a dimensionally - unsplit , 2nd - order , godunov , grid - based code ( athena ) that combines the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) for spatial reconstruction and the corner transport upwind ( ctu ) method of colella ( 1990 ) for time - advancing multi - dimensional hydro with the ct method for divergence preservation .",
    "their numerical focus has been on making the ctu method compatible with both constrained transport and the finite - volume philosophy of ppm in the unsplit context .",
    "the result is an accurate and conservative mhd code with great potential to address astrophysical problems .",
    "smooth - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) codes have recently been augmented to include magnetic fields , using divergence cleaning techniques ( price & monaghan 2005 ; ziegler , dolag , & bartelmann 2006 ) and have been employed to study , among other 3d problems , the merger of binary neutron stars ( price & rosswog 2006 ) .",
    "divergence cleaning techniques have been criticized vis  vis staggered - mesh , divergence - free formulations ( balsara & kim 2004 ) for artificially imposing post - facto cleaning methods to ensure @xmath5 , but the approach is still useful for exploratory investigations .",
    "aloy et al .",
    "( 1999ab ) have developed a sophisticated special - relativistic , axisymmetric mhd code that incorporates as algorithmic elements finite - volume , godunov , directional splitting , constrained transport , and an hll - type solver . using a similar code , obergaulinger et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have recently investigated the mri in the axisymmetric core - collapse context .",
    "there are now several general - relativistic mhd codes that promise to set the standard for astrophysical grmhd simulations in the future .",
    "shibata & sekiguchi ( 2005 ) have constructed a grmhd code that features fully conservative numerical algorithms , dynamic space - times , and the constrained transport method .",
    "noble et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have built a conservative grmhd code employing approximate riemann solvers and a variant of constrained transport .",
    "anninos , fragile , & salmonson ( 2005 ) have produced the grmhd code , cosmos++ , that , while it also assumes a fixed background space - time , has unstructured grids .",
    "cosmos++ is non - godunov , uses artificial viscosity , uses finite - volume discretization , and has an amr mode .    despite all these recent developments in computational mhd and enormous progress in computing power and in numerical techniques ,",
    "there is still no single code today that can simulate radiation - magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) in full , mainly because a multi - angle , multi - group transport code is expensive , even in 2d . in this paper , we present a modest step toward such a code by reporting a new mhd scheme , incorporated into the already operational multi - group radiation hydrodynamics code vulcan/2d ( livne 1993 ; livne et al .",
    "2004 ) . using multi - group , flux - limited diffusion",
    "we have obtained and recently published an interesting new explosion mechanism for core - collapse supernovae ( burrows et al .",
    "we have also explored accretion - induced rotational collapse ( dessart et al . 2006a ) , convection in protoneutron stars ( dessart et al .",
    "2006b ) , the angle - dependence of the neutrino field and neutrino heating on rotation rate ( walder et al . 2005 ) , the mapping between initial and final spins in the core - collapse context ( ott et al .",
    "2006a ) , and the gravitational radiation signatures of multi - d supernovae ( ott et al .",
    "there are several basic advantages of vulcan/2d over other codes ( together with some drawbacks ) which enable the code to perform in difficult situations .",
    "one basic feature of vulcan/2d is its ability to use unstructured grids , which in principle can efficiently cover any domain . for example , polar grids become singular at the center of a star and cartesian grids have difficulty resolving the center , while at the same time covering the entire star . in vulcan/2d , we construct a grid by merging an inner curved rectangular with an outer polar grid .",
    "the resulting grid resolves the entire star with no singularity . in order to maintain this capability",
    "we have designed our mhd scheme for unstructured grids , having arbitrarily - shaped ( but convex ) quadrilateral cells .",
    "another approach has been taken by ardeljan et al .",
    "2000 , who use a 2d grid composed of triangles only , that also avoids the singularity of polar grids .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the new mhd technique and present a number of test problems that demonstrate the ability of the code to simulate 2d magnetohydrodynamics problems with both toroidal and poloidal fields .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows . in ",
    "[ differ ] , we describe in several subsections the basic equations and the finite - difference methodology for arbitrary geometry (  [ basic ] ) , the lagrangean case (  [ lagrange ] ) , and the eulerian case (  [ euler ] ) .",
    "we continue in  [ axial ] with a discussion of the implementation in axially - symmetric geometries (  [ axial ] ) and follow with a discussion of the method for evolving the toroidal component with rotation (  [ toroid ] ) .",
    "we end  [ differ ] with a few words on necessary modifications to the courant / cfl condition and boundary conditions (  [ cfl ] ) .",
    "section [ one ] presents one - dimensional test problems and  [ two ] presents two - dimensional tests , some of them are new .",
    "for some of the test problems the magnetic stresses are comparable to the pressure stresses .",
    "the associated tables and figures support our conclusion (  [ conclusions ] ) that the automatically divergence - conserving mhd scheme we have implemented for general unstructured grids in our rmhd code vulcan/2d provides competitive and reasonably accurate solutions to the dynamic equations of mhd in the newtonian regime .",
    "in this paper we do not consider gravity , and therefore , omit gravity terms from the equations .",
    "we also omit here all possible interactions between matter and radiation .",
    "this physics , very relevant to the core - collapse problem , is already included in vulcan/2d and has been reported in several papers ( burrows et al .",
    "2006ab ; ott et al . 2006ab ,",
    "dessart et al .",
    "the mhd equations for incompressible flow in lagrangean coordinates are ( landau & lifshitz 1960 ; chandrasekhar 1961 ) : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the specific energy per gram and @xmath8 ) is the pressure , given by the equation of state for a given density , @xmath9 , internal specific energy per gram , @xmath7 , and electron fraction , @xmath10 ( the mean number of electrons per baryon ) .",
    "the lagrangean time derivative @xmath11 can be translated to the laboratory - frame by the transformation @xmath12 .",
    "the majority of current numerical schemes for hydrodynamics , including ours , use cell - centered variables for the construction of finite - difference approximations to the fluid equations .",
    "but unlike godunov - type schemes , like ppm , vulcan/2d uses staggered differencing where the acceleration and velocity are computed at cell nodes rather than at cell centers . in such staggering schemes",
    "the acceleration is computed by integrating the pressure times the normal over the surface of a control volume around each node .",
    "therefore , we seek a scheme in which the magnetic field is also cell - centered , so that the contribution of the magnetic stress to acceleration can be handled in a similar fashion .",
    "this approach is different , for example , from the choices made in moc - ct schemes ( stone & norman 1992b ) , where the magnetic field variables are face - centered ( component @xmath13 is face - centered in the @xmath14direction , but cell - centered in the perpendicular direction ) .",
    "we do not calculate lorentz forces directly but rather compute the magnetic stress forces from the conservative form of the equations of motion .",
    "this is achieved using standard integration schemes , as is done for example in ardeljan ( 2000 ) .",
    "one advantage of our approach is the exact conservation of momentum through the simulation . in vulcan/2d",
    ", we use the cartesian coordinates @xmath15 in the planar case and the cylindrical coordinates @xmath16 in the axisymmetric case . with these choices of coordinate systems ,",
    "our scheme preserves linear momentum by construction , ( @xmath17 in the planar case , @xmath18 in the cylindrical case ) , and , in the latter case , angular momentum as well .",
    "we shall discuss the magnetic acceleration in more detail in section 2.2 , where the cylindrical case is presented .",
    "our field equation incorporates the _ flux - freezing principle _ used in stone & norman ( 1992b ) . for a given surface , @xmath19 , enclosed by a closed loop , @xmath20",
    ", we define the flux : @xmath21 if the surface moves with some arbitrary _ grid velocity _ @xmath22 the temporal derivative of @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 here , the time derivative is taken along the trajectory @xmath25 .",
    "we can utilize eq .",
    "( 6 ) to evolve a cell - centered b - field in both lagrangean and eulerian schemes in the following way .",
    "take , for example , the two - dimensional planar case , where a cell is some arbitrarily - shaped , convex , quadrilateral in the @xmath15 plane . in order to evolve the field in time , according to the flux - freezing principle , we need to define two control surfaces in that cell ( the number of control surfaces must be equal to the number of field components ) .",
    "there are several ways of constructing such control surfaces inside a given cell .",
    "we considered two such ways  first , connecting opposite mid - edge centers and second , connecting diagonals of two opposite nodes .",
    "for each such choice we can construct a simple scheme for the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the _ diagonal scheme _ has been found to be more stable , while at the same time obeying the divergence - free condition of the magnetic field in a very elegant way .",
    "therefore , we shall focus on this choice in the rest of the paper .      ignoring for now the toroidal component of the field , @xmath26 , the field is described by its two poloidal cell - centered components @xmath27 . by writing two finite - difference approximations of eq .",
    "( 6 ) for the two surfaces one gets two linear equations for the two field components .",
    "let us consider first the lagrangean case , where @xmath28 and the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( 6 ) vanishes .",
    "denote the two components of the two surfaces by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 . also , denote variables at the beginning of the timestep by superscript @xmath32 and variables at the end of the timestep by superscript @xmath33 .",
    "the discretization of eq .",
    "( 6 ) in this case yields the following two linear equations for the magnetic field at the end of the timestep : @xmath34 the geometrical factors @xmath35 are the components of the vector @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37    it is easy to show that a divergence - free field remains divergence - free if we define a finite difference _",
    "node - centered _",
    "approximation for the divergence . from the divergence theorem ,",
    "one gets the approximation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a grid node , @xmath19 is a closed surface surrounding that point and @xmath40 is the volume contained inside @xmath19 . for our _ diagonal scheme _ the surface @xmath19 is composed of the four diagonals surrounding @xmath39 ( see fig .  1 ) , and , therefore , the integral in eq . ( 11 ) is unchanged when the fields in the four relevant cells are evolved by eqs .",
    "( 7)(10 ) .      in the more general case , where @xmath41 , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 6 ) represents advection of the b - field across the grid and does not vanish .",
    "we shall focus on the more common eulerian case , where @xmath42 . for each of our two surfaces we now have to compute the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 6 ) , and by this obtain two linear equations for the new cell - centered components of the field . to do this",
    "we need to extrapolate field values from cell centers to the four nodes of each cell .",
    "note that for our _ diagonal scheme _",
    "the divergence - free condition still holds throughout the evolution , because the advection terms cancel out in the integration of eq .",
    "( 11 ) over a closed loop .",
    "this is true regardless of the _ nodal_-field values .",
    "however , for reasons of stability and accuracy , these nodal values must be carefully defined according to monotonicity principles .",
    "this is a crucial step where the scheme is different from current moc - ct schemes , which rely on one - dimensional flux - splitting in each direction . our unstructured grid , which is certainly not orthogonal , requires more complex extrapolation in order to ensure accuracy and stability .",
    "the eulerian form of our difference scheme for the cell - centered components yields the following two linear equations : @xmath43_1   \\\\ s_{x,2}^{n+1 } b_x^{n+1 } + s_{y,2}^{n+1 } b_y^{n+1 } & = & s_{y,2}^{n } b_x^{n } + s_{y,2}^{n } b_y^{n }             + \\delta t [ b_x v_y - b_y v_x ] _ 2 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the brackets @xmath44_i$ ] stand for the difference between the enclosed expression on the two edges of diagonal @xmath45 . the accuracy and stability of the scheme depend upon the exact definition of the nodal values of the magnetic field , while the velocity values are already node - centered .",
    "we , therefore , have to construct appropriate single - valued nodal field components from the cell - centered basic field , and those will be used in the advection terms on the right - hand - side of eqs .",
    "( 12)(13 ) .",
    "the construction consists of the following steps :    * compute spatial slopes for the field components according to van leer s monotonic advection scheme ( van leer 1979 ) .",
    "* extrapolate cell - centered values to the nodes using those slopes .",
    "note that for one - dimensional advection of a scalar field this procedure provides a monotonic and second - order - accurate scheme when the advection is done upwind .",
    "* there are now four nodal values for each field component at any internal node @xmath46 , and each of them is related to one diagonal surface in one of the surrounding cells ( see diagonals a , b , c , d in fig .  2 ) . using the velocity vectors at that node define the _ upwind parameter _",
    "@xmath47 for each diagonal , where @xmath48 is a unit vector along the diagonal @xmath45 pointing to the node @xmath46 .",
    "according to the sign of this _ upwind parameter _ define the type of each surrounding surface to be _ donor - type _ if @xmath49 and _ acceptor - type _ otherwise .",
    "* usually , there will be two _ donor - type _ surfaces ( diagonals a and d in fig .  2 ) and two _ acceptor - type _ surfaces ( diagonals b and c in fig .",
    "2 ) at each ( internal ) node , but in regions where the grid is non - orthogonal this rule may not hold . without loss of generality",
    "assume that surfaces @xmath50 are the two most _ donor - type _ surfaces out of the four surrounding surfaces , with nodal fields @xmath51 and normals @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "construct the single - valued nodal field vector @xmath53 by solving the two linear equations @xmath54 , i=1,2 , which imply that the normal fluxes on the donor - type surfaces are the same when computed using @xmath53 or the primitive extrapolations @xmath55 .",
    "the above algorithm deserves a few remarks .",
    "first , the choice of donor - type surfaces actually guarantees that the two chosen diagonals ( surfaces ) are not parallel , so that this construction is indeed possible .",
    "secondly , the construction of the nodal magnetic vector from the donor - type normal components ensures that the new fluxes are kept bound through the advection step .",
    "this is essentially the heart of our generalization of van leer s monotonic upwind scheme to the case of magnetic fluxes .",
    "only minor changes are needed for boundary points and we omit discussion here of those details . finally , the same algorithm is applicable for general nonzero _ grid velocity _ , which could be used in ale simulations by vulcan/2d .",
    "let us use the common coordinates , cylindrical @xmath56,@xmath57,@xmath58 , for the radial , axial , and azimuthal directions .",
    "assuming axial symmetry the azimuthal derivative of any variable vanishes everywhere , but the toroidal components of the magnetic field and the azimuthal velocity do not vanish .",
    "we first present the equations of motion in a form suitable for discretization : @xmath59 - \\dpdr \\\\",

    "( 2000 ) and chapter ix of chandrasekhar ( 1961 ) for the incompressible inviscid case .",
    "the main reason for writing the magnetic terms in this form is that the equation for the axial momentum and the equation for the angular momentum have a conservative form .",
    "the difference scheme of vulcan/2d preserves these conservation laws by construction .",
    "the impulse and acceleration at each grid point are obtained by integrating the above equations over the surface of a local control volume , a cell in the staggered grid , which surrounds the point .",
    "thus , momentum conservation laws are preserved exactly by the finite - difference scheme , as the integration provides at each surface segment two forces which have equal magnitude and opposite direction . since this technique is standard in hydrodynamical schemes which use staggered grids we omit further details .",
    "note however that the radial momentum in cylindrical coordinates is not a conserved quantity .",
    "returning to the evolution of the magnetic field we first discuss the poloidal components ( @xmath60 ) , while the evolution of the toroidal field will be described separately in  [ toroid ] .",
    "the numerical approximation of those equations is obtained from the flux - freezing principle in a way similar to the planar case .",
    "we first take a cell in the @xmath16 plane with the two surfaces defined by the diagonals connecting opposite nodes .",
    "the cell represents a torus around the axis of symmetry and the surfaces are actually closed ring - like sheets centered around the axis of symmetry . in the lagrangean case , the resulting two linear equations for ( @xmath61 ) are then    @xmath62    where the geometrical factors are    @xmath63    @xmath64 being the radius at the center of each surface .",
    "we see that the only difference with the planar case is the factor of @xmath65 multiplying each geometrical factor . likewise ,",
    "in the eulerian case we get equations similar to eqs .",
    "( 12)(13 ) with appropriate @xmath65 factors .",
    "therefore , the numerical technique for evolving the poloidal field is almost identical to that in the planar case .      for the time evolution of the toroidal component",
    "we need an extra equation . in the pure eulerian case , which is our most common case , the equation for the toroidal field takes the form @xmath66 using flux freezing again , we define an extra surface which extracts the toroidal field .",
    "this is just the rectangular image of the cell in the @xmath16 plane . integrating eq .",
    "( 21 ) over this surface yields the desired equation .",
    "after integration , the right - hand - side gives edge - centered advection terms which we compute using the standard upwind van leer scheme .",
    "we employ an _ explicit _ version of vulcan/2d hydro and , thus , must restrict the timestep according to stability constraints .",
    "we use the cfl condition ( courant & friedrichs 1948 ) updated to account for the propagation of alfvn and fast magnetosonic waves . in practice , we use @xmath67 where @xmath68@xmath69@xmath68 is the local velocity ( accounting for any rotational component as well ) and @xmath70 is the fast - magnetosonic speed ( @xmath71 ) , where @xmath72 is the alfvn speed and @xmath73 the sound speed . note that in core - collapse supernova simulations , incorporating modest initial magnetic fields does not reduce noticeably the time increment , which after bounce is of the order of a microsecond .",
    "vulcan/2d can also operate in an implicit mode where the courant condition for acoustic waves is removed .",
    "the mhd solver however is explicit in nature .",
    "this implies that , depending on the field strength , the timestep in future implicit simulations could be restricted by the speed of alfvn waves .    as to boundary conditions , they can be rather complicated if one wishes to simulate general mhd problems in arbitrary geometries .",
    "since we are interested mainly in the core - collapse problem , and problems of a similar nature around compact objects , we choose to sacrifice the general case in favor of the most simple treatment . in our current implementation , the dynamical region in embedded in a large enough ambient region where either practically nothing changes during the simulations , or the outer boundary is not allowed to move .",
    "therefore , under those restricted assumptions , a divergence - free initial field remain stationary in the outer regions of the flow .",
    "a number of one - dimensional and two - dimensional test problems have been chosen to verify the code , in both planar and cylindrical geometries .",
    "we have computed some of the test problems suggested in stone et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and in stone & norman ( 1992b ) .",
    "we have also designed a few new test problems which are relevant to dynamical collapse .",
    "the results of each vulcan/2d simulation are compared to a simulation done under identical conditions using the publicly available mhd code zeus/2d ( stone et al .",

    ", we present one - dimensional planar and cylindrical test problems . for this purpose",
    ", we constructed a one - dimensional lagrangean magnetohydrodynamic version , vulcan/1d , based upon the mhd formalism outlined in this paper and upon the earlier work of bisnovatyi - kogan et al .",
    "vulcan/1d is a variant that assumes that all the hydrodynamical and magnetic variables are functions of ( @xmath74 ) alone .",
    "we use this lagrangean code for testing our basic _ flux freezing _ approach in constructing the finite - difference scheme , and also for post comparisons between vulcan/2d and vulcan/1d . in most cases ,",
    "the results of our vulcan/2d ( eulerian ) simulations are compared either to similar results obtained using vulcan/1d ( lagrangean ) or to those obtained using zeus/2d ( eulerian ) .",
    "this problem addresses the one - dimensional advection of a pulse of transverse magnetic field in cartesian geometry , following the procedure presented in evans & hawley ( 1988 ) and in stone et al .",
    "the velocity is fixed and uniform throughout the grid and the exact solution is just a translation of the initial signal .",
    "the test probes the magnitude of the numerical dispersion and diffusion of the advection scheme employed in the mhd solver , that should operate exactly like the same advection scheme of a scalar field .",
    "our initial conditions are a one - dimensional grid of 500 zones , equally spaced to tile the @xmath75-direction from 0 to 100 .",
    "we use a courant number of 0.5 and the equation of state is that of an ideal gas . density and pressure are set to a fixed value everywhere , a value which does not matter in practice since we perform pure advection . , the velocity is unity everywhere , and we start with a non - zero transverse magnetic field between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "<S> we report a new finite - difference scheme for two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations , with and without rotation , in unstructured grids with quadrilateral cells . </S>",
    "<S> the new scheme is implemented within the code vulcan/2d , which already includes radiation - hydrodynamics in various approximations and can be used with arbitrarily moving meshes ( ale ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mhd scheme , which consists of cell - centered magnetic field variables , preserves the nodal finite difference representation of @xmath0 by construction , and therefore any initially divergence - free field remains divergence - free through the simulation . in this paper , we describe the new scheme in detail and present comparisons of vulcan/2d results with those of the code zeus/2d for several one - dimensional and two - dimensional test problems . </S>",
    "<S> the code now enables two - dimensional simulations of the collapse and explosion of the rotating , magnetic cores of massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it can be used to simulate the very wide variety of astrophysical problems for which multi - d radiation - magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) is relevant .    </S>"
