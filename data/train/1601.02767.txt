    "the two - dimensional @xmath1-whittaker particle system on the torus was introduced by corwin and toninelli @xcite .",
    "the state of this system is interlacing collections of particles on the two - dimensional torus .",
    "particles jump right by one on their row according to exponential clocks whose rates are determined by certain nearest neighbor inter - particle distances  see ( [ eq:6prime ] )  as well as a parameter @xmath3 . as discussed in @xcite , the dynamics can be seen also as a stochastic growth process for a random discrete @xmath2-dimensional interface .",
    "the mapping is based on the fact that interlacing particle configurations correspond to perfect matchings ( dimer coverings ) of the hexagonal lattice , and the associated integer - valued height function provides the discrete interface . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the point of view of the particle system rather than that of the growth model .",
    "these dynamics originated in borodin and corwin s study of macdonald processes @xcite wherein they were defined on certain triangular arrays of interlacing particles . based on that inspiration as well as a recent treatment by toninelli in @xcite of the @xmath4 case of this system , @xcite proposed and then verified that certain local gibbs measures are stationary for the dynamics",
    " see ( [ eq:3prime ] ) and proposition [ prop1 ] for a summary of those results .    when @xmath4 , @xcite determined that stationary measures are simply uniform measures on particle configurations , which are known to enjoy a relation to determinantal point processes and to have gaussian free field type fluctuations in the infinite volume limit for the torus .",
    "in @xcite it was also shown that the dynamics remain well - defined in the infinite volume limit and bounds on the scale of fluctuations of the associated height function for the system were determined . in particular , it was shown that height function fluctuations grow at a smaller rate than any polynomial in time @xmath5 ( and that the bound can be improved to @xmath6 in a certain range of particle densities ) .",
    "the @xmath4 model is predicted ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to be in the anisotropic @xmath2-dimensional kardar - parisi - zhang universality class which is represented by the stochastic pde @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents a height function at time @xmath5 and position @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the laplacian in @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a @xmath14 matrix with signature @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a space - time white noise .",
    "this is called anisotropic because of the mixed signature on the non - linearity , whereas when the signature of @xmath13 is @xmath17 or @xmath18 the model is called `` isotropic '' . in 1991 ,",
    "wolf @xcite predicted that the fluctuations of the anisotropic equation should grow like @xmath19 and moreover that the non - linearity should be irrelevant and the long - time behavior of the system should be exactly as that of the two - dimensional additive stochastic heat equation ( i.e. , the equation with @xmath13 set to zero ) .",
    "wolf s prediction of @xmath19 fluctuations was demonstrated numerically soon after by halpin - healy and assdah @xcite .",
    "prhofer and spohn @xcite considered a microscopic model related to the gates - westcott model , and demonstrated through exact calculation this fluctuation scaling .",
    "borodin and ferrari @xcite studied a ( non - periodic ) triangular array variant of the @xmath4 case of the @xmath1-whittaker particle system and , using the technology of schur processes they proved the @xmath19 scaling and further demonstrated convergence to a gaussian free field as time goes to infinity .",
    "the occurrence of a gaussian free field is consistent with the prediction of convergence to the additive stochastic heat equation since the gaussian free field is stationary for the time evolution of that stochastic pde .",
    "it should be noted that since @xcite dealt with dynamics on a triangular array of particles , the gaussian free field fluctuations only appear after a suitable coordinate change .",
    "this coordinate change is not visible from the renormalization group arguments of wolff . in this paper",
    "we focus on translation invariant models for which no coordinate change is necessary .",
    "we should note that ( [ akpz ] ) is not , a priori , well - defined because of the non - linearity and the fact that solutions are not function valued , but rather generalized functions ( like the gaussian free field ) .",
    "we are not aware of any rigorous treatment of this equation , though it may eventually fall into the class of systems which can be defined through hairer s regularity structures @xcite . as such",
    ", none of wolf s predictions have been proved for ( [ akpz ] ) itself .",
    "let us also note that the story is quite different when the model is isotropic  see recent numerical studied of halpin - healy @xcite .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the present paper , together with the forthcoming work of borodin , corwin and ferrari @xcite in the context of these dynamics on triangular arrays , is the first instance in which the full space - time picture has been rigorously established for a model in the @xmath2-dimensional anisotropic kpz class converging to the additive stochastic heat equation . to be upfront about things",
    ", we do not prove this convergence as a process ( which would require some additional tightness estimates ) , but rather in terms of the correlation structure for gaussian processes .",
    "the initial motivation for this paper was the desire to extend the study of @xcite to the @xmath20 case . in that case",
    "the schur / determinantal point process structure is lost . to overcome this impediment",
    ", we decided to consider a gaussian limit of the model , hoping that calculations there would become sufficiently doable without said structure .",
    "in particular , we consider the @xmath21 limit of the particle system , as we simultaneously scale the torus width and height like @xmath22 . we start particles spaced on the @xmath22 scale according to a certain crystalline configuration ( see the beginning of section [ sec : conv ] ) with smaller @xmath23 scale fluctuations .",
    "speeding time up by @xmath22 , we prove ( theorem [ th : sde ] ) that particle positions ( multiplied by @xmath24 ) have asymptotically a constant speed @xmath25 and that fluctuations ( multiplied by @xmath26 ) converge ( as a space - time process ) to a limiting system of sdes .",
    "likewise , under this scaling the stationary measure on the @xmath1-whittaker system converges to a gaussian measure ( lemma [ th : locmax ] ) .",
    "( note : we do not prove that the stationary measure concentrates on the crystalline configuration , though it is certainly compelling to conjecture this ) .",
    "once in the setting of sdes with gaussian stationary measures ( in fact , the stationary measures are on gradients ) we are able to use fourier transforms to explicitly compute the space - time correlations as the number of particles goes to infinity ( theorem [ th:2 ] ) as well as the correlations and gaussian free field limit of the stationary measure ( theorem [ th : muinv ] ) .",
    "theorem [ th:2 ] has a number of corollaries .",
    "corollary [ cor1 ] shows that for fixed , large time @xmath5 , fluctuations grow like @xmath19 and correlations decay in a spatial range of order @xmath27 .",
    "corollary [ cor2 ] considers the correlations along space - time lines .",
    "there exists a distinguished direction @xmath28 along which correlations exist in a temporal scale of order @xmath5 and a spatial scale of order @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , corollary [ cor3 ] shows that in this scale , the correlations converge to those of the @xmath2-dimensional additive stochastic heat equation  thus validating wolf s prediction for this model . on the other hand , corollary [ cor2 ]",
    "also shows that for space - time direction not equal to @xmath28 , the correlations decay to zero on a @xmath27 time - scale , thus much faster than along @xmath28 .",
    "we call the direction @xmath28 the `` characteristic '' direction .",
    "the reason is that the lines @xmath29 are the characteristic curves of a pde that we conjecture to describe the hydrodynamic limit of our model when the initial condition is not crystalline , see section [ sec : pde ] .",
    "there is a close analogy with what happens in the context of @xmath30-dimensional particle systems . in that setting ,",
    "the hydrodynamics are described by hamilton - jacobi conservation laws which can be solved by computing the characteristics and propagating initial data along them .",
    "characteristics are computed as the derivative of the flux with respect to the local slope . at a more microscopic level ,",
    "initial data fluctuations are propagated along characteristics .",
    "in particular , one has `` slow decorrelation '' @xcite along characteristics whereby fluctuations along these space - time directions decorrelate far slower than along other space - time directions .",
    "the phenomenon of slow decorrelation along characteristics was conjectured ( with some supporting evidence ) in @xcite to hold for the two - dimensional @xmath1-whittaker particle system at @xmath4 .",
    "the aforementioned results concerning correlations of two - dimensional systems of sdes are actually proved below in much broader generality .",
    "in particular , all results are proved provided that the sdes take the form of with the matrix @xmath31 satisfying the conditions of proposition [ prop : prop ] .",
    "this could reflect the expected universality of the @xmath2-dimensional anisotropic kpz class",
    ". it would be compelling to see if any of these universality results can be proved directly for the general @xmath1 system , without first taking the sde limit . without the gaussian structure ,",
    "though , it is unclear how to proceed in this goal .",
    "as mentioned above , in the @xmath4 case , there exists a triangular array variant of the @xmath1-whittaker particle system which was studied at length in @xcite using schur processes . the triangular variant of the general @xmath1 case relates to @xmath1-whittaker processes @xcite and",
    "though the system is no longer determinantal , there are many useful formulas provided through the technology of macdonald processes . in a parallel paper to this ,",
    "borodin , corwin and ferrari @xcite develop the analogous @xmath0 limit of this triangular variant of the particle system and explore the limits of the exact formulas and their applications ( in particular , concerning the asymptotic behavior of correlations along certain space - time directions ) .      the authors wish to thank patrik ferrari for conversations on this work and the related work @xcite .",

    "we start by recalling the definition of the @xmath1-whittaker particle system on the torus , and its stationary measure as defined in @xcite .",
    "we consider an interacting particle system in which particles live on the @xmath32 discrete torus @xmath33 .",
    "the horizontal size is @xmath34 and the vertical size is @xmath35 .    the particle configuration space will be denoted @xmath36 , and it depends on two integers @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that @xmath39 at each site @xmath40 there is at most one particle .",
    "on each row there are exactly @xmath41 particles .",
    "we exclude @xmath42 and @xmath43 to avoid trivialities .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 has a more topological nature and its meaning will be explained below .",
    "the horizontal position of particle @xmath45 is denoted @xmath46 .",
    "particle positions are interlaced , in the following sense . given particle @xmath45 ( say on row @xmath47 ) , we let @xmath48 denote its right / left neighbor on the same row ( note that if @xmath49 then @xmath50 ) .",
    "then , we require that in row @xmath51 there is exactly one particle , labeled @xmath52 , whose position satisfies @xmath53 and exactly one particle , labeled @xmath54 , satisfying @xmath55 see figure [ fig : particelle ] .",
    "note that , automatically , in row @xmath56 there are exactly one particle @xmath57 and one particle @xmath58 satisfying respectively @xmath59     of particle labeled @xmath45 .",
    "note that conditions , allow @xmath60 but they impose @xmath61 . ]",
    "we define non - negative integers @xmath62 as @xmath63 the particles @xmath64 are the six neighbors of @xmath45 , labeled clockwise starting from the one on the right .",
    "the definition of the dynamics will be such that the labels of the neighbors of a particle @xmath45 do not change with time ( particles will not jump over each other or change interlacements ) .",
    "let @xmath65 be the set of particle occupation functions , i.e. of functions @xmath66 , with @xmath41 particles ( i.e. occupation variables equal to 1 ) per row , whose positions satisfy the constraints - .",
    "the set @xmath65 decomposes into disjoint `` sectors '' : @xmath67 as follows .",
    "given any particle @xmath45 , connect @xmath45 to its up - right neighbor @xmath58 , then @xmath58 with its own up - right neighbor and repeat the operation until the path @xmath68 thus obtained gets back to the starting particle @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath68 forms a simple loop : otherwise , there would be a particle @xmath69 which is reached along @xmath68 from two different particles @xmath70 .",
    "this is impossible , since both @xmath71 and @xmath72 would be the lower - left neighbor @xmath73 of @xmath69 .",
    "call @xmath74 the vertical and horizontal winding numbers of @xmath68 around the torus @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath76 are independent of the chosen initial particle @xmath45 . as discussed in (",
    "* remark 2 ) , @xmath77 is an integer and it satisfies .",
    "the set @xmath78 is defined as the subset of @xmath65 with @xmath79 .",
    "each sector @xmath36 will remain invariant under our dynamics .",
    "let us briefly remark that the particle configurations we are considering can also be mapped onto dimers on the periodized @xmath32 hexagonal lattice .",
    "this perspective is explained in @xcite ( see in particular fig . 2 there )",
    "wherein @xmath80 corresponds to the number of vertical dimers , @xmath81 to the number of north - west dimers and @xmath82 the number of north - east dimers .",
    "we will not pursue this perspective any further here .",
    "given a configuration @xmath83 , draw a directed upward edge from any particle label @xmath69 to its up - right neighbor @xmath84 if @xmath85 ( in which case @xmath69 and @xmath84 have the same horizontal position ) . for",
    "the particle labeled by @xmath45 let @xmath86 be the set that includes @xmath45 plus the particle labels that can be reached from @xmath45 by following upward oriented edges .",
    "the dynamics we consider is a continuous - time markov chain on @xmath36 . for each @xmath45",
    ", there is an exponential clock of rate @xmath87 with @xmath3 .",
    "when said clock rings , all particles with label @xmath88 shift by @xmath89 .",
    "note that the rate is zero if @xmath90 .",
    "this prevents particles from overlapping after the move .",
    "note also that after the move , the configuration is still in @xmath36 .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "another way to understand the dynamics is that when particle @xmath45 moves , provided its up - right neighbor @xmath91 , then @xmath92 becomes @xmath93 and the jump rate for @xmath58 becomes infinite , and hence it immediately moves ( and so on for all other @xmath94 ) .",
    "these dynamics are called the @xmath1-whittaker particle system on the torus .",
    "as a side remark , let us add that , in terms of dimer model , shift to the right by @xmath95 of a family @xmath86 corresponds to increasing the height by @xmath96 in @xmath97 faces of the hexagonal lattice",
    ".    given @xmath98 , let @xmath99 be the probability measure on @xmath36 defined as @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the normalizing constant necessary to make this a probability measure .",
    "the main result of @xcite ( theorem 1 therein ) is :    [ prop1 ] the probability law @xmath99 is stationary in time for @xmath1-whittaker particle system on the torus .",
    "clearly , the measure @xmath99 is not reversible , since the process is totally asymmetric .    we will consider a certain @xmath0 limit of the particle system . to fix scalings , for @xmath103 let @xmath104 . for simplicity ( to avoid a plethora of @xmath105 )",

    "on each row there are @xmath108 particles , with @xmath109 an integer of order @xmath107 .",
    "also for simplicity we take @xmath110 , so altogether we have @xmath111 particles . taking @xmath35 to be another multiple of @xmath109 would not change our results qualitatively .",

    "actually , one has @xmath120 , since @xmath121 .",
