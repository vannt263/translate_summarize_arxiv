    "after the recent discovery of a higgs - like state at the lhc one of the primary question to ask is whether these new boson is compatible with the one predicted in the sm or if it belongs to some other beyond the sm ( bsm ) theory .",
    "bsm scenarios are usually asked to solve the ( in)famous hierarchy problem present in the sm and the most common way to do this is to add a new kind of symmetry . besides supersymmetry",
    "another solution based on the goldstone symmetry has been more and more taken into account in the last years : this is the idea at the basis of composite higgs models in which the higgs boson is a pngb arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry .",
    "modified higgs couplings with respect to the sm ones and the presence of extra gauge bosons and coloured fermions can affect the higgs phenomenology making these scenarios really attractive in the light of the lhc results .",
    "a 4 dimensional realization of the general idea proposed in @xcite and specialized to the coset @xmath0 in @xcite has been proposed in @xcite under the name the 4dchm name and will be the framework of our analysis @xcite .    besides the sm particles the 4dchm present in its spectrum 8 extra gauge bosons , 5 neutral called @xmath1 and 3 charged called @xmath2 , and 20 new quarks : 8 with charge @xmath3 , 8 with charge @xmath4 and 2 respectively with charge @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; these coloured fermions are called @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these states mix via the _ partial compositness _",
    "mechanism with the sm states having the same @xmath11 charge and this together with the non linear realization of the goldstone symmetry give rise to higgs couplings which are modified with respect to the sm .",
    "moreover in loop induced processes the effective couplings are also modified by the presence of extra states running into the loops ( as in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 vertices for example ) .",
    "the parameter space of the model is given in terms of the scale @xmath16 of the spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath0 , the @xmath17 coupling of the new @xmath18 gauge fields and a set of 9 parameters in the fermionic sector which are a mass parameter of the extra states , @xmath19 , 4 mixing parameters between sm and extra quarks , @xmath20 and 4 yukawa parameters describing the interaction between the extra states themselves , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "given the large number of parameters and particles the model has been implemented in automatic tools ( using lanhep @xcite and calchep @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter scan has been done for various model scales @xmath16 , fixing @xmath23 tev , varying the parameter of the fermionic sector and imposing to reconstruct the higgs , top and bottom masses .",
    "lhc limits arising from the direct search of extra quarks have been taken into account .    to compare our results to lhc data",
    "we have defined the following parameters , the latter being the signal strength that is the observed signal over the sm expectation , recasted in term of the @xmath14 parameters denotes the particles partecipating in the higgs boson production , e.g. @xmath24 in the case of gluon fusion . ] : @xmath25    in fig.[fig : kmupar ] we show the plots for @xmath26 ( left ) , @xmath27 ( centre ) and @xmath28 ( right ) where one notices the decrease of the higgs total width and @xmath24 partial width with respect to the sm mainly due to the modified @xmath29 coupling .",
    "@xmath30 also enters the computation of the @xmath28 parameter compensating the decrease of the effective @xmath31 and @xmath32 couplings and giving a total result almost stable with respect to the sm .",
