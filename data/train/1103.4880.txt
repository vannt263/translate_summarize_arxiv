    "in the last years there has been an increasing interest on electromagnetic ( as opposed to purely electrostatic ) quantum plasma phenomena . with the emergence of new fields like spintronics @xcite where magnetic effects are fundamental , it is essential to have a deeper knowledge on electromagnetic quantum plasma models .",
    "for instance , recently eliasson and shukla @xcite have reported on the bernstein modes in a magnetized , degenerated quantum plasma described by the vlasov - maxwell system . in this work ,",
    "the fermionic nature of the charge carriers was taken into account thanks to the underlying fermi - dirac type equilibrium .",
    "consequently , the upper hybrid dispersion relation for a degenerate quantum plasma was derived .",
    "however , the employed kinetic equation was classical ( vlasov ) , so that the second quantum effect besides statistics , or quantum diffraction effects , was not included . to take care of the typical quantum phenomena like wave packet spreading and tunneling",
    ", one must resort to a quantum kinetic equation for the reduced one - particle wigner function , which is the quantum analog of the usual classical reduced one - particle distribution function in phase space . for these reasons , it is advisable to go one step further and formulate a general kinetic electromagnetic theory for linear waves in quantum plasmas .",
    "there are , nevertheless , already many instances where linear and nonlinear wave propagation in electromagnetic quantum plasmas were treated . for instance , one can cite the quantum weibel instability , the dense plasma magnetization by the electromagnetic waves , the temporal dynamics of spins in magnetized plasmas , stimulated scattering quantum instabilities and the analysis of self - trapped electromagnetic waves in a quantum hole , as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite by shukla and eliasson .    in the present work",
    "we show a kinetic treatment of the quantum filamentation instability , significantly generalizing the earlier fluid - based model @xcite",
    ". moreover , the basic kinetic model we use is the evolution equation for the gauge - invariant wigner function @xcite , which fully takes into account quantum diffraction .",
    "in addition , we assume a counter - streaming zero - temperature fermi - dirac equilibrium , so that the quantum statistical effects due to the exclusion principle are also incorporated .    this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the general electromagnetic dispersion relation for linear waves in quantum plasmas . in section iii , the quantum kinetic filamentation instability is worked out .",
    "the dispersion relation is compared with the results from the classical zero - temperature fluid model and the quantum hydrodynamic model , with a bohm potential term . also",
    "the behaviors of the cuttof wave vector , of the most unstable wave vector and the corresponding largest growth rate are studied .",
