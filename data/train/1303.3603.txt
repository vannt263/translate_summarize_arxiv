    "figure [ fig : p3d6-u - plane - loop2-minus ] @xmath128 [ fig : p3d6-u - plane - loop2-plus ] describes the stokes geometry on the @xmath139-plane near @xmath424 .",
    "first we consider the case that the independent variable @xmath41 ( or @xmath139 ) lies outside of the `` loop '' . here",
    "we impose the following assumption ( a-2 )  instead of ( a-2 ) :    * the small number @xmath38 satisfies that , for any @xmath351 , any stokes curves never touch with any points in @xmath346 when @xmath426 .    in this case the discussion given in section [ subsection : connection of triangle - type ] can be applicable , and the relevant voros coefficient to be considered to derive the connection formula are one of @xmath427 ( @xmath186 ) or @xmath428 .",
    "these voros coefficients are all borel summable when @xmath129 lies on the wall @xmath425 , and hence they never jump on the wall .",
    "therefore , we have the following conclusion : + * connection formula on @xmath425 . * on the other hand , the cases when @xmath41 ( or @xmath139 ) lies inside the loop are quite different from the above case .",
    "when the loop - type degeneration appears and @xmath418 lies inside the loop , the assumption ( a-2 )  is not satisfied for any @xmath38 because of `` infinitely many spirals '' . actually , if @xmath349 is fixed inside of the loop , then stokes curves touch with @xmath349 infinitely many times as @xmath129 tends to @xmath429 varies @xmath351 , and hence usual stokes phenomena occur to transseries solutions infinitely many times .",
    "these loop - type degenerations have not been analyzed even in the case of linear differential equations , due to the same difficulty . in order to describe connection formulas , we need some modification of the borel resummation method , but we do not have an appropriate way at this time .",
    "this is a future issue to be discussed .",
    "here we show the examples of stokes geometry of @xmath0 on the @xmath139-plane ( @xmath139 is defined by ) when the parameter @xmath129 is in the chambers @xmath430 @xmath128 @xmath431 and on the walls @xmath432 @xmath128 @xmath433 in figure [ fig : walls and chambers ] .",
    "note that , since the quadratic differential is invariant under the exchange of the parameters @xmath434 , so is the stokes geometry .",
    "therefore it is enough to show the stokes geometries when @xmath129 is in the chambers @xmath435 and on the boundaries of them .",
    "we conjecture that , as long as the parameter @xmath129 does not across the walls , the topological type of configuration of the stokes curves never change , and degeneration of stokes geometry occur only on these walls .",
    "this is true as far as we checked by numerical experiments , but we can not confirm it analytically .",
