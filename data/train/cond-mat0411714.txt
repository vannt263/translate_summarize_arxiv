    "pioneering studies of ordered double perovskites have been already done in the 1960s.@xcite several decades after , the discovery of a large room temperature ( rt ) tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) in a low magnetic field in sr@xmath0femoo@xmath1 and sr@xmath0fereo@xmath1 triggered revived interest in such ordered double perovskites in view of the possibility of industrial applications for spin - electronic devices.@xcite these materials were predicted to have half - metallic density of states ( dos ) like the manganites.@xcite several band - structure calculations have shown that metallic ordered double perovskites are generally half - metallic,@xcite and the half metallic dos has been confirmed by optical and valence - band photoemission studies.@xcite    among the broad class of the ordered double perovskites , ( sr@xmath13ca@xmath14)@xmath0fereo@xmath1 is known as an exceptional system.@xcite in particular , ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 shows metal - insulator transition ( mit ) as well as has a very high ferrimagnetic transition temperature ( @xmath15 ) of 540k,@xcite which is the second highest in the known ordered double perovskites.@xcite kato _ et al._@xcite have studied the temperature and composition ( @xmath16 ) dependent mit in ( sr@xmath13ca@xmath14)@xmath0fereo@xmath1 ; the ground state changes from metallic to insulating at @xmath16@xmath50.4 with increasing @xmath16 , and the transition temperature ( @xmath4 ) rises up to @xmath5150 k at the ca end . they have also reported that this mit accompanies a structural phase transition . since ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 and sr@xmath0fereo@xmath1 ( or ba@xmath0fereo@xmath1 )",

    "the agreement between b@xmath46 and b@xmath45 is not satisfactory although the high - energy end is well reproduced ; the b@xmath46 monotonically increases with photon energy , mostly reflecting the increase of fe 3@xmath18 cross section ( see panel ( b ) ) while b@xmath45 shows a dip behavior .",
    "this is possibly due to a remnant of the fe 3@xmath40 - 3@xmath18 on - resonance enhancement at @xmath558 ev,@xcite and if one see the region above 80 ev , b@xmath45 almost monotonically increases . in this high photon - energy region ,",
    "the discrepancy between theory and experiment becomes larger when b@xmath0 is compared . because b@xmath0 includes a lower binding - energy region , this is probably a consequence that b@xmath0 has the re 5@xmath18 weight to some extent .",
    "in other words , the re 5@xmath18 ( + fe 3@xmath18 ) @xmath39 band and the fe 3@xmath18 @xmath41 band are overlapping around -1 ev .",
    "this is simply because the edge of the band which accommodates two re 5@xmath18 electrons should be located deeper than the edge of the band having only one mo 4@xmath18 electron .",

    "the total dos ( gray area ) includes only fe @xmath18 ( white area ) , re @xmath18 ( thick gray area ) , and o @xmath40 ( the other area ) states because the other states have negligibly small contributions .",
    "the relative intensity of the three partial dos was fixed to that of the calculated photoionization cross - sections of each orbital.@xcite the theoretical curve ( solid curve ) was obtained by broadening the cross - section - corrected total dos with a gaussian due to the experimental resolution as well as with an energy - dependent lorentzian due to the lifetime effect.@xcite the background of the experimental spectra was subtracted .    in panel ( a )",
    ", one can assign the structures @xmath47@xmath22@xmath48 in the theoretical curve to a@xmath22 g in experiment .",
    "the characteristic double - peak structure ( a ( actually a@xmath45+a@xmath0 ) and b ) is essentially reproduced in the theoretical curve as @xmath47 ( re@xmath22fe @xmath39 ) and @xmath49 ( fe @xmath41 ) .",
    "it is noted that @xmath47 has also two components @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the two structures @xmath52 and @xmath53 are due to the fe @xmath42 and the o 2@xmath40 states .",
    "the o 2@xmath40 contribution to @xmath52 and @xmath53 is rather large because a large part of the fe @xmath42 weight is redistributed to the higher binding energy region .",

    "fe @xmath42 and fe @xmath41 bonding states contribute to @xmath55 and @xmath48 to some extent , respectively .",

    "the main part of the valence band seems to be shifted towards @xmath3 by about 1 ev like the sr@xmath0femoo@xmath1 case.@xcite nevertheless , the location of @xmath49 is so deep that it is about to merge into @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , the theoretical curve has a large intensity at @xmath49 , a large portion of which is actually due to the tail of @xmath52 .",
    "the high binding energy of @xmath49 is most likely caused by the large @xmath6 for fe .",
    "panel ( b ) and ( c ) show detailed comparisons in the near-@xmath3 region at 150 and 100 ev , respectively . the two fine structures a@xmath45 and a@xmath0 can be seen at -0.33 and -0.66 ev .",
    "the distance between them is about 0.3 ev , which is close to that between @xmath50 ( -0.26 ev ) and @xmath51 ( -0.54 ev ) .",
    "in addition , the intensity of @xmath50 relative to that of @xmath51 decreases with photon energy because @xmath50 has more re 5@xmath18 weight than @xmath51 . this behavior is accordant with our observation that a@xmath45 becomes less clear with increasing photon energy ( see also fig .",
    "[ figcooper ] ) .",
    "therefore , a@xmath45 and a@xmath0 can be assigned to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that even in panel ( c ) the intensity of @xmath47 is much larger than that of a in spite that its location is in good agreement with a. this sharply contrasts with the metallic sr@xmath0femoo@xmath1 case , in which the experimental intensity of a is comparable to the theoretical one.@xcite consequently , such a difference should be related to a strong suppression of the near-@xmath3 spectral weight ( particularly a@xmath45 ) due to its insulating ground state although it would be partly because the present samples are polycrystals .",
    "in fact , the small near-@xmath3 intensity even above @xmath4 is consistent with what would be expected from the optical conductivity data which exhibited a very small drude weight above @xmath4.@xcite      temperature - dependent valence - band spectra of ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 taken with 100 ev are shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ figtdep ] . the seven structures a@xmath22 g identified in fig .  [ figvblt ] can be observed . unlike the low - temperature spectra in fig .",
    "[ figvblt ] , however , the comparison between the scraped and the fractured surfaces at 200 k shows that the intensity of the feature g is considerably higher in the fractured one , indicating that a scraped surface is basically more reliable than a fractured one for the temperature - dependent measurement of this compound .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that no spectral - weight redistribution is observed in a large ( @xmath5ev ) energy scale .",
    "hence the effects of the mit on the spectra would be observed only in the vicinity of @xmath3 .",

    "the fermi cut - off gradually fades away with decrease in temperature and completely disappears below 100 k. this temperature is somewhat lower than the reported @xmath4 of 140@xmath5150 k.@xcite the energy gap in the low - temperature insulating phase is very small even at the lowest temperature .",
    "taking into account the broadening due to the fermi - dirac distribution at 20 k as well as the experimental resolution , we estimate the energy gap ( below @xmath3 ) is about or less than 50 mev .",
    "this is comparable to the theoretical value , but the theory still gives a smaller number in spite of the large @xmath2 for re 5@xmath18 .    in panels ( d ) and",
    "( e ) , the near-@xmath3 spectral weight is plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "the plots show the same behavior in spite that the typical spectral lineshapes in ( a ) and ( b ) are a little different due to the different surface treatments ; the near-@xmath3 weight starts decreasing from @xmath56175 k down to 100@xmath56125 k , and remains nearly constant below this temperature .",
    "note that finite weight at low temperatures is due to the finite integration window .",
    "the rather gradual decrease of the near-@xmath3 spectral weight may be an indication of the two - phase coexistence.@xcite however , because of the very small depletion of the @xmath3 weight across the mit as well as the limited energy resolution , the precise determination of @xmath4 or an observation of the possible two - phase coexistence was beyond our experimental accuracy .",
    "to elucidate the origin of the temperature - induced mit in the ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 , we compare sr@xmath0fereo@xmath1 and ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 first . as we have briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ secintr ] , the only difference between the two compounds is the bond angle of fe - o - re .",
    "hence the most naive scenario will be that the bond - angle distortion due to ca substitution reduces the one - electron bandwidth and leads the electron localization .",
    "in reality , however , the origin of the mit would not be only the bond - angle distortion , because ca@xmath0femoo@xmath1 , having almost the same bond - angle distortion and the crystal structure as ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 , does not show mit.@xcite the two important differences between ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 and ca@xmath0femoo@xmath1 are ( 1 ) mit occurs in ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 , while it does not in ca@xmath0femoo@xmath1 and ( 2 ) @xmath15 is far different to each other ( ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 : 540 k , ca@xmath0femoo@xmath1 : 380 k ( ref .  ) ) .",
    "because the crystal structure and the octahedral bond - angle distortion are almost the same , the origin of those differences can not be attributed to crystallographic reasons .    here , we focus on the ionic radius of the re and mo ions in stead of @xmath33 site cation size , which has been investigated more.@xcite since the valence of fe is known as about 2.5 + from the mssbauer measurements,@xcite we use the average ionic radius of re@xmath57 and mo@xmath57 to estimate the re and mo ionic radius , which are calculated to be 0.565 @xmath58 and 0.600 @xmath58 , respectively.@xcite thus",
    ", the average ionic radius of the re ion is actually even smaller than that of the mo ion in spite of the difference of the 5@xmath18 and 4@xmath18 orbitals .",
    "we have also calculated the one - electron bandwidth of the hybridized re - o or mo - o states using the harrison s formula.@xcite the result is approximately the same in both systems as expected from the above consideration .",
    "therefore , the coulomb repulsion at the re sites can be substantially large in ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 .    the key to understand this surprising consequence is the mismatch of the ionic radius of the re ion and the ( double ) perovskite - type crystal structure ; roughly speaking , the crystal structure of @xmath59o@xmath1 is like a rather firm  cage \" constructed by @xmath33 ( ca in this case ) and o in which @xmath9 and @xmath60 ( fe and re in this case ) is located .",
    "hence the re ion can be smaller than the  appropriate \" ionic radius which is determined by the ionic radius ratio of ca and o , and the re@xmath22o distance is substantially larger than what is expected from a binary compound reo@xmath12 . in reo@xmath12 , the re@xmath22o distance can be the  appropriate \" one simply because there is no other element .",
    "thus the re 5@xmath18@xmath22o 2@xmath40 hybridized bands become wide as expected , resulting in the good metallic behavior of reo@xmath12 .",
    "by contrast , the large re@xmath22o distance in ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 can cause a much smaller electric conductivity although one usually thinks that a 5@xmath18 band must be wide .",
    "in this situation , another important factor is that ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 has @xmath61 re 5@xmath18 electrons while ca@xmath0femoo@xmath1 has only @xmath62 mo 4@xmath18 electron per one re / mo atom .",
    "this would give rise to a considerably larger effective electron - electron interaction on re sites in ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 than on mo sites in ca@xmath0femoo@xmath1 , which can explain the large @xmath6 for re in our lda+@xmath2 calculation .",
    "the importance of the electron correlation on re sites in the mit of this compound has been inferred by granado _",
    "_ first , although they did not deal with the origin of a large @xmath6 on re sites in detail.@xcite here we have demonstrated that the strong electron correlation on re sites is actually realized in terms of the observation of mit coupled with the lda+@xmath2 band theory with a finite energy gap .",
    "the actual mit of this compound is probably driven by this strong electron correlation coupled with the jahn - teller distortion due to the 5@xmath63 configuration both of which strongly favor the expected orbital ordering.@xcite thus the origin of the temperature - induced mit in ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 is not just the decreasing one - electron bandwidth , but the major factor is most likely the strong electron correlation between the re 5@xmath18 @xmath43 electrons , which is caused by the mismatch of the re ionic radius and the crystal structure plus the multiple 5@xmath18 electrons per one re site .    finally , we briefly discuss the striking difference of @xmath15 between ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 and ca@xmath0femoo@xmath1 in terms of the direct overlap of re@xmath22re or mo@xmath22mo .",
    "since the crystal structure and the bond - angle distortion of both systems are virtually identical , we can adopt the distance between the two b@xmath64 site atoms and the ionic radius as measures of the amount of the direct overlap .",
    "according to the crystal structural parameters , re@xmath22re and mo@xmath22mo distance are 5.525 @xmath58 and 5.522 @xmath58 , respectively.@xcite this difference is negligibly small and indeed smaller than that of the two average ionic radii by a factor of one tenth .",
    "thus the average ionic radius primarily determines the amount of direct overlap , and the smaller average ionic radius of re leads the smaller re@xmath22re direct overlap than that of mo@xmath22mo . according to chattopadhyay and millis , a larger direct overlap decreases @xmath15 because the ferromagnetic coupling is enhanced under the reduced direct overlap.@xcite this is in perfect agreement with our simple arguments using the ionic radius and hence further supports our arguments on the origin of mit of this compound .",
    "we have investigated the temperature dependent electronic structure of ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 by photoemission spectroscopy and lda+@xmath2 band - structure calculations . in the valence - band spectra , we have observed the double - peak structure which is characteristic of metallic double perovskites although it was unclear compared with the sr@xmath0femoo@xmath1 because of the larger number of the re 5@xmath18 @xmath39 electrons than that of the mo 4@xmath18 @xmath39 ones . above @xmath4 , the spectral weight at @xmath3 was found to be small as expected from the optical conductivity , and completely disappeared below 100 k , forming an energy gap .",
    "the mit occurred between 125 k and 100 k , but a finite weight at @xmath3 due to the temperature and instrumental broadening decreases the apparent @xmath4 . employing large @xmath6 s for both fe and re ,",
    "we have reproduced the finite energy gap in the lda+@xmath2 band theory . although the most of the experimental features were interpreted with the help of the band theory , the overall agreement between theory and the valence - band spectra was not satisfactory .",
    "based on the ionic radii and the lattice parameters , we have pointed out that the effective transfer integral between fe and re is actually smaller than that between fe and mo in ca@xmath0femoo@xmath1 .",
    "this results in a substantially large electron - electron interaction on re site ( namely the re 5@xmath65fe 3@xmath18 @xmath39 band ) , which should be the major driving force of the mit in this compound .",
    "finally , the very high @xmath15 in ca@xmath0fereo@xmath1 has also been argued in connection with the re@xmath22re direct overlap .",
