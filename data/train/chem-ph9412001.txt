    "although the electronic excited states of most molecules are known to predissociate , the exact mechanisms of these processes remain largely undetermined .",
    "the difficulty in modeling molecular predissociation is that the predissociation is usually caused by a coupling of a bound excited electronic state to another electronic state in which the nuclear motion is not bound@xcite .",
    "the rate of dissociation depends upon the properties of both electronic states , as well as the nonadiabatic coupling between them .",
    "in contrast , the rate of predissociation of the ammonia  state is determined by the rate of crossing over , or tunneling through , a small barrier on a single potential energy surface@xcite .",
    "while a conical intersection exists well beyond this barrier , this intersection effects only the product state distribution and not the predissociation rate .",
    "since knowledge of only a single electronic surface is needed to understand the  state predissociation , it represents one of the most theoretically tractable chemical reactions .",
    "the nature of the barrier to  state dissociation is well understood . in an early _ ab initio _ scf and ci study ,",
    "the  state was shown to result from excitation to the 4a@xmath5 molecular orbital ( mo ) which continuously changed from a predominantly 3s rydberg orbital at the equilibrium conformation to a hydrogen 1s atomic orbital at large h@xmath1n  h separation@xcite .",
    "a small barrier exists along this coordinate due to the change from rydberg to anti - valence character of this orbital as an n ",
    "h bond was stretched .",
    "the magnitude of this barrier was also shown to be a minimum for planar geometry and to increase with out - of - plane deformation .",
    "the minimum barrier height remains a controversial quantity . in the initial _ ab initio _",
    "study by runau _",
    "et al._@xcite , the barrier was predicted to lie 4600  @xmath2 above the  state minimum while a more involved theoretical calculation that allowed the h ",
    "n  h angle to relax has predicted this barrier to lie at 3200  @xmath2@xcite .",
    "semi - classical trajectories predict it lower by an additional 1200  @xmath2@xcite .",
    "an accurate determination of this barrier height is essential to correctly understand the predissociation mechanisms .",
    "hence , its determination was a primary goal of the present work .    besides the exhaustive theoretical effort , an extensive experimental effort has also been directed toward characterizing the barrier height and predissociation mechanisms . due to the lack of rotational data",
    "as discussed in the previous paper , much of the current understanding of the predissociation mechanism(s ) has been extracted by interpreting the vibronic dependence of the predissociation lifetimes . in particular , vaida and",
    "coworkers@xcite observed a single fourteen member progression in the absorption spectrum of nh@xmath0 and nd@xmath0 in a seeded supersonic jet .",
    "inhomogenous broadening was sufficiently reduced such that for each vibronic member of this progression , an average rovibrational predissociation rate was extracted . in agreement with the _ ab initio _",
    "predictions@xcite , for both isotopomers , the predissociation rates were observed to be slowest for the 2@xmath4 level due to the strong dependence of the barrier height on out - of - plane deformation . above this level for both species ,",
    "the predissociation rate was observed be enhanced greatly by increasing @xmath3 excitation .",
    "they postulated that for these higher lying levels anharmonic interactions were coupling energy from the bound bending coordinate to the unbound dissociation coordinate , thus , circumventing the barrier . due to the strong anharmonicity of the  state potential ,",
    "only a limited amount of information about the barrier is likely to be revealed through the study of these higher lying levels .",
    "deuterium substitution has been shown to reduce the predissociation rate in  state ammonia substantially and particularly in the lowest few vibronic levels@xcite .",
    "thus , determining predissociation lifetimes as a function of the number of hydrogens substituted should be a sensitive measure of the barrier height .",
    "this effect is attributed to the slower tunneling rates of the deuterium compared to hydrogen as well as slower tunneling rates due to the lower zero point energy of the n - d stretching modes@xcite .",
    "if one neglects the interaction among the three equivalent n - h(d ) bands , the dissociation rate would be the sum of tunneling rates through the three equivalent barriers and each subsequent deuterium substitution would result in an approximate constant decrease in predissociation rate .",
    "such an effect has been observed in the  state action spectra from photodissociation through the 2@xmath4 level@xcite . at even greater excitation , coupling of vibrational energy into the dissociation",
    "coordinate would be expected to enhance the dissociation rate , since it provides a mechanism to ` go over the top ' of the barrier .",
    "such resonances will depend sensitively on the frequencies of the individual modes involved such that a simple isotopic dependence would not be expected .",
    "the effect of any vibration - rotation interactions on the dissociation rate may also lead to a more complex isotopic dependence .",
    "since the lowest two vibronic levels could only predissociate by tunneling through this barrier , it was anticipated that a better picture of the barrier would be revealed through an understanding of the predissociation in the lowest few vibronic levels .",
    "hence , these levels have been probed by a host of experimental techniques including absorption@xcite , two photon fluorescence excitation ( 2pfe)@xcite , and rotational resonance raman excitation profiles ( rrrep)@xcite . this work has established a weak predissociation dependence on rotational level .",
    "this rotational dependence has been quantitatively fit to a model incorporating a centrifugal modification to the barrier height@xcite . however , the much stronger rotational dependence observed in the rrrep s could have also been described by coriolis forces@xcite . these two different mechanisms",
    "could not be distinguished since the results of these experiments represent an average increase among all k sublevels such that distinguishing between the two different mechanisms is difficult .",
    "fully rotationally resolved spectra have been recorded by optical - optical double resonance methods@xcite .",
    "however , these experiments were not able to establish a significant predissociation dependence on rotational level .",
    "it should be noted that one step of this double resonance scheme involves a multiphoton excitation that might be expected to distort the observed lineshapes .",
    "thus , due to the experimental uncertainty of the determined linewidths in these experiments , a weak predissociation dependence on rotational level might have been masked .",
    "microwave detected , microwave optical double resonance has recently been used to probe the dynamics in the nh@xmath0  state 2@xmath6 band@xcite . the rotational dependence observed in this level was again quantitatively fit using the centrifugal model@xcite . in the previous paper , we reported the  @xmath7 x transition frequencies measured by modr for the higher lying vibrational levels of the nh@xmath0  state as well as for the isotopomers@xcite .",
    "this technique has also enabled us to measure the homogeneous linewidths for individually resolved @xmath8 rovibronic transitions for the entire isotopomeric series .",
    "our observed linewidths are considerably narrower than previous reports@xcite .",
    "thus , it was hoped that these results would enable us to discern for the various isotopomers the vibrational and rotational contributions to the  state predissociation mechanisms .    assuming that stretching motions are more correctly described by a local mode",
    "coordinate system rather than a normal mode one , a crude one dimensional potential was designed along an n - h(d ) internal bond coordinate .",
    "this potential has been used to demonstrate that a 2 - 1 fermi resonance between @xmath3 and @xmath9 quantitatively predicts the observed linewidths for levels with more than one quantum in @xmath3 . for the lowest two levels ,",
    "predissociation could only occur by tunneling through this barrier . to reproduce the observed linewidths of the vibrationless levels in nh@xmath0 and nd@xmath0 ,",
    "the barrier height was reduced roughly 1000  @xmath2 relative to the _ ab initio _ value .",
    "this result agrees with the conclusion of dixon@xcite who also has demonstrated that the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations@xcite overestimate the barrier .",
    "the predissociation efficiency was also shown to be weakly dependent upon rotation .",
    "surprisingly , this rotational dependence was found to be isotope dependent .",
    "for the hydrogen containing isotopomers , the rotational dependence was more adequately described by coriolis forces coupling energy from @xmath3 and into @xmath10 and @xmath11 , while for nd@xmath0 , this rotational dependence obeyed the centrifugal model .",
    "this difference arises from the fact that in nh@xmath0 , one quantum of @xmath3 added to the n  h zero point energy is isoenergetic with scattering states above the barrier to dissociation while for nd@xmath0 , this energy still lies below the top of the barrier .",
    "thus , for nd@xmath0 , the coriolis contribution to the predissociation rate is reduced such that tunneling remains the dominant predissociation pathway .",
    "the recording and analysis of the modr and rfodr data was described in the previous paper and will not be repeated here .",
    "the linewidths obtained from such an analysis are given in tables [ nh3widths ] , [ nh2dwidths ] , [ nhd2widths ] , and [ nd3widths ] .",
    "as suggested by ziegler@xcite , the observed widths were fit to , @xmath12 + \\gamma_{c}k^{2}\\ } \\label{fit_equation}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the observed width , @xmath14 is a determined constant for a given vibronic band , @xmath15 reflects the enhancement by rotation in the plane of the molecule , and @xmath16 that of the enhancement due to rotation about the symmetry axis . for the asymmetric top species , k@xmath17 is replaced by @xmath18 , calculated from the fitted rotational constants . in these fits ,",
    "the observed widths were weighted by the reciprocal of the squared uncertainty predicted by the lineshape fit .",
    "results are given in table  [ datafit ] . because the microwave probe transitions are q branch lines of the inversion band , our data is primarily for high k lines . for the mixed isotopomer data , we were not able to determine the rotational dependence of the widths due to the limited number of transitions observed in these molecules .",
    "for the asymmetric tops , the ground state q branch is widely spread , reducing the number of strong transitions in the region covered by our microwave equipment .",
    "the  state absorption spectrum has been modeled as a two symmetric mode problem@xcite .",
    "one quantum of stretching excitation contains more energy than needed to overcome the barrier along a single n  h bond , yet",
    "the @xmath9 normal mode coordinate is still strongly bound .",
    "the dissociation reaction coordinate is a mixture of @xmath9 and the two components of the antisymmetric n  h stretching mode , @xmath10 .",
    "this potential topology will lead to strong nonlinear interaction between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 normal modes such that an initial state corresponding to @xmath9 excitation will rapidly trifurcate into three equivalent wave packets corresponding to bond - breaking along each of the three equivalent n ",
    "h(d ) bonds .",
    "the depth of the exit channels and the sharpness of the motion along the symmetric stretch should lead to little amplitude being reflected back .",
    "thus , one should expect only weak recurrence@xcite .    in work on stable symmetric hydrides , such as the ground state of ammonia",
    ", it has been established that one can treat the x ",
    "h stretching motion equivalently with either a local mode or normal mode basis .",
    "when the single bond anharmonicity dominates over the bond - bond harmonic coupling , the eigenstates are expected to be close to symmetrized local mode states .",
    "contrarily , when the harmonic coupling dominates over anharmonicity , the eigenstates are closer to normal mode basis functions . for perfect harmonic motion ,",
    "the local mode and normal mode descriptions of the fundamental levels are identical . for the ammonia  state , however , the potential along a single n ",
    "h bond is highly anharmonic .",
    "in fact , as will be shown below , the zero point level is the only resonance below the barrier . as a result ,",
    "excitation of one bond mode leads to dissociation in a single vibrational period .",
    "the time required for exchange of vibrational energy between the n ",
    "h bonds is longer by approximately @xmath19/@xmath20 , which based upon the _ ab initio _ harmonic force field@xcite is predicted to be greater than 50 .",
    "thus , the  state of ammonia is the ` ultimate ' local mode molecule , with bond - bond coupling negligible compared to the rate of dissociation if the n ",
    "h stretching modes are excited . as a result",
    ", we have modeled the dissociation in terms of three uncoupled , single bond modes .",
    "figure  [ potential ] shows a model potential we have used to fit the observed dissociation rate .",
    "the curve contains information from the _ ab initio _",

    "the potential was taken to be -10000  @xmath2 correlating with the energy difference of the nh@xmath0  state and the ground states of the photofragments , nh@xmath1 and h@xcite .",
    "the real eigenstates , @xmath22(e ) were calculated at each energy by numerical integration and normalized such that @xmath23 .",
    "we begin our discussion with the barrier height picked to agree with the most recent _ ab initio _ prediction of 3200  @xmath2@xcite . in order to mimic what we would expect for @xmath9 absorption activity , we calculated the franck - condon overlap of @xmath22(e ) with a gaussian picked to model the zero point level of the ground electronic state .",
    "the resulting squared overlap versus energy is presented in figure  [ ab_initio_overlap ] .",
    "we observe a sharp resonance at 1450  @xmath2 with a hwhm of 0.16  @xmath2 .",
    "this resonance corresponds to the zero - point level below the dissociation barrier .",
    "if this represented the vibrationless level of the  state , one predicts a homogeneous width of three times this size since there are three equivalent hydrogen atoms that could tunnel out ; thus , the lifetime broadening will be three times the lifetime broadening of each n - h bond .",
    "this prediction is much smaller than the 17  @xmath2 hwhm measured for the nh@xmath0 origin .",
    "while the features of our crude potential have a clear physical interpretation , this potential overestimates the thickness of the barrier relative to the _ ab initio _ potential@xcite . as a consistency check , using a spline interpolation , we numerically solved the one - dimensional schroedinger equation for this potential .",
    "franck - condon overlap with the ground state wavefunction resulted in a sharp resonance at 1460  @xmath2 with a width of 0.73  @xmath2 in qualitative agreement with the results from our more crude approach .",
    "thus , we justify our simple method and conclude that the _ ab initio _ calculation has overestimated the barrier height .",
    "dixon reached the same conclusion based upon his two - dimensional wavepacket calculations@xcite .    in order to reproduce the observed 17.1  @xmath2 width of the nh@xmath0 zero point transition , the barrier height in our model potential",

    "the zero point level lies 1350  @xmath2 above @xmath24 and has a hwhm of 5.7  @xmath2 per hydrogen in good agreement with the experimental measurement .",
    "thus , in order to model the experimentally measured width of the nh@xmath0 zero point level , we need to lower the _ ab initio _",
    "barrier height@xcite by more than 1000  @xmath2 .    as shown in figure  [ nh3_overlap ] , an extremely broad quasi - resonance above the barrier is also present .",
    "this quasi - resonance represents what may be called one quantum in the n - h local mode .",
    "eigenstates in this energy region have their inner turning points at bond lengths slightly less than @xmath25 , and thus have significant overlap with the ground state gaussian .",
    "our crude calculation predicts this resonance lies 3370  @xmath2 above @xmath24 ( 2020  @xmath2 above the zero point level ) and has a 2850  @xmath2 linewidth . because of its broad width , the peak absorption is expected to be small relative to the zero point level , making this level very difficult to detect .",
    "et al._@xcite have measured a 500  @xmath2 wide resonance centered at 2300  @xmath2 above the zero point level that they have assigned to 1@xmath4 .",
    "as discussed in our previous paper , we have reassigned this band to 4@xmath17 .",
    "this level is very likely to be strongly coupled to the n  h stretching modes through fermi coupling leading to the observed rapid dissociation rate .    using the same potential",
    ", we also calculated the franck - condon overlap for an n  d bond .",
    "results from the calculation are presented in figure  [ nd3_overlap ] .",
    "the zero point level is found at 1035  @xmath2 with a width of 0.16  @xmath2 per deuterium .",
    "the nd@xmath0 zero point level is predicted to have a homogeneous linewidth of 0.48  @xmath2 comparing favorably with the experimental measurement of 0.4  @xmath2 .",
    "we calculate the n - d second resonance to have a homogeneous linewidth of 1360  @xmath2 and to lie about 2750  @xmath2 above @xmath24 or about 1720  @xmath2 above the zero point level .",
    "a broad feature was observed at 1790  @xmath2 in the nd@xmath0 dispersed fluorescence spectrum that has been assigned to the 1@xmath4 band . as for nh@xmath0",
    ", we reassign this feature to the 4@xmath17 band .",
    "a quantitative calculation to test the accuracy of this local mode approximation is clearly desirable .",
    "unfortunately , this calculation would require at a minimum _ ab initio _ calculations along the three stretching coordinates , and then a 3-d wavepacket propagation of the ground state gaussian on this potential .",
    "if such a calculation dramatically reduces the predicted resonance widths of the 1@xmath4 level , then we would withdraw our reassignment of the peaks ashfold _ et al._@xcite assign to 1@xmath4 .",
    "however , since the basic vibronic and isotopic trends are predicted by this crude potential , we believe our empirical dissociation potential contains the essential features of the true potential .",
    "the increasing dissociation rate with @xmath3 excitation above 2@xmath4 suggests that anharmonic interactions are coupling two quanta of vibrational energy out of the bending normal mode into one of the three n - h(d ) bond coordinates lying along the dissociation coordinate@xcite .",
    "the lowest order vibrational coupling that could be responsible is a fermi resonance between @xmath3 and @xmath9 caused by the @xmath26 term in an harmonic approximation .",
    "we estimate the value of this coupling constant by assuming the molecule vibrates out - of - plane with constant bond length .",
    "this approximation is justified by the _ ab initio _ potential@xcite .",
    "classically , the above coupling leads to a forcing of the stretching mode at two times the frequency of the bending mode .",
    "if there is a 2:1 resonance of the harmonic frequencies , one would expect an efficient transfer of energy inside some resonance zone .",
    "the experimentally determined force field given in the previous paper does not predict an exact resonance@xcite , but a small amount of average energy transfer would be expected due to non - resonant coupling .",
    "further , given the rapid dissociation of the n - h(d ) stretching modes , their frequencies are poorly defined , making the resonance condition much less restrictive .",
    "a 2:1 fermi resonance implies the transfer of two quanta in @xmath3 into one quantum in @xmath9 ; anharmonic transfer of one quantum of @xmath3 is rigorously symmetry forbidden .",
    "we see that this mechanism operates only for levels containing two or more quanta in @xmath3 and the rapid increase in linewidth observed above the 2@xmath4 level is predicted .",
    "we use our empirical potential to estimate the expected magnitude of the fermi resonance .",

    "states with two quanta in the out - of - plane bending mode couple directly to scattering states above the dissociation barrier .",
    "we use fermi s golden rule to estimate the contribution of the coupling to the dissociation rate , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the coupling matrix , @xmath34 is the energy relative to the bottom of the exit channel , and the @xmath35 factor arises due to the density of states and box normalization of the wavefunctions . assuming the simplest resonance , fermi coupling between the bend and the stretch is predicted by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the cubic bend stretch force constant , h is the out - of - plane bend internal coordinate , and @xmath38 is the coupling matrix element .",
    "@xmath39 is the zero point resonance normalized to unity inside the well and @xmath40 is a continuum function normalized to @xmath41 in the asymptotic region ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we use the harmonic approximation for the out - of - plane bend and values for @xmath43 from our experimentally estimated force field to determine the expectation value for @xmath44 .",

    "these calculated values are presented in table  [ linewidths ] along with our measured values .",
    "the predicted dissociation rates are about a factor of three too large for the 2@xmath17 levels , and increase too rapidly above that . roughly , the isotopic dependence is correctly predicted .",
    "one explanation for the predicted dissociation being much faster than observed is that the _ ab initio _ value of @xmath37 may be too large .",
    "even more significant may be our neglect of the barrier dependence on out - of - plane angle .",
    "increasing the barrier height will reduce the coupling matrix element among the zero point level and the scattering states and decrease the predicted fermi resonance contribution to the dissociation rate .",
    "consequently , we conclude that our overestimate of the fermi contribution to the dissociation rate is caused by the neglect of the barrier dependence on out - of - plane deformation . proper treatment of this problem , including both fermi resonance and the effect of barrier changes with out - of - plane angle , requires two - dimensional wavepacket calculations that are beyond our computational resources .",
    "this resonance calculation does rationalize the larger than expected dissociation rate for the nhd@xmath1 isotopomer .",
    "even though there is great uncertainty as to the frequency of the stretching levels , two quanta of @xmath3 for nhd@xmath1 would be expected to be in closer resonance with the n  d stretch than for two quanta in any of the other isotopomers , leading to an enhanced dissociation rate .",
    "contrary to the mechanism controlling the dynamics in the tunneling region , this mechanism predicts that the n ",
    "d bond dissociates faster than the n - h bonds for these higher lying levels .",
    "the predissociation dependence on rotational level can arise from two independent sources . in the first mechanism ,",
    "as extensively discussed by ashfold et al.@xcite and ziegler@xcite , rotation about either the b or c axes will promote an n ",
    "h(d ) bond lengthening resulting in an effective barrier reduction . in the second mechanism ,",
    "b axis rotation causes the @xmath3 mode to be coupled to the unbound @xmath10 and @xmath11 modes through coriolis forces and , hence , increasing the probability of barrier penetration . if centrifugal effects are the dominant source of rotational enhancement , the ratio of b to c axis effects should be constant with vibronic excitation .",
    "contrarily , the coriolis coupling matrix elements would scale with @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the two mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring the ratio of b to c axis effects as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we estimate this ratio allowing only centrifugal effects to contribute . assuming the dissociating h(d ) atom lies on the y axis , the effective potential is given by @xmath47}{4i_{x}({\\roarrow{r } } ) } + \\frac{k^{2}}{2i_{z}({\\roarrow{r } } ) } \\label{centrifugal}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the rotationless potential and @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 are the expectation values for x and z axis rotation respectively . using the _ ab initio _",
    "values for @xmath25 and @xmath51 at 1.055    and 1.32    respectively , the rotational correction to the barrier height is estimated to be @xmath52 + 0.73k^{2}. \\label{rotational_correction}\\ ] ] thus , the centrifugal model predicts a b axis effect to c axis effect ratio of 1.75 .",
    "we also note that for the centrifugal model this ratio is independent of the barrier shape and only weakly dependent upon barrier position .",
    "for instance , as @xmath51 was varied from @xmath25 to @xmath53 , this ratio only changed from 2 to 1 .    from our nh@xmath0 data , the ratio of b axis to c axis effects",

    "@xmath54 2 . for the 2@xmath4 level .",
    "we predict that centrifugal effects dominate in the vibrationless level while coriolis forces dominate in the 2@xmath4 level .",
    "this change in dominant mechanism can be explained utilizing our empirical n  h local mode potential .",

    "the 2@xmath4 level lying roughly 900  @xmath2 above this level is expected to lie well above the barrier and therefore be coriolis coupled to a manifold of continuum states .",

    "we still can compare our determined ratio of b axis to c axis enhancement for the two isotopomers .",
    "in contrast to nh@xmath0 , this ratio for the nd@xmath0 2@xmath4 level was determined to be 2.1(7 ) more in line with the centrifugal model .",
    "surprisingly , for the two isotopomers , the dominant mechanism for rotational enhancement appears to be different .    to understand this result we again turn to our empirical n - h local mode potential .",

    "addition of one quantum in @xmath3 with an energy of approximately 670  @xmath2 still lies well below the barrier .",
    "since continuum states below the top of the barrier have small amplitude near @xmath25 , the coriolis coupling matrix element should be much smaller for nd@xmath0 than for nh@xmath0 .",
