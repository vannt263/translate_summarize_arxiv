    "the quality of a final surface in a cutting process is of a natural interest of industry and technology .",
    "grabec @xcite and gradisek with co - workers @xcite analyzed a simple orthogonal cutting model and found that , chaotic conditions of tool - workpiece system , given by appropriate system parameters , are possible .",
    "as they have demonstrated , the appearance of such chaotic conditions can have crucial effect on the stability of cutting process .",
    "the chaotic vibrations also were investigated experimentally by tansel and others in @xcite . on the other hand instabilities of cutting process",
    "have been known for long time as a chatter phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the mechanism their appearance includes the nonlinear self - excitation in the cutting process , which leads to vibrations with larger value of amplitude , beyond the admissible limit .",
    "one of the source of instabilities can be identified in the roughness of a material initial surface , which introduces randomness of the material resistance during the dynamic process .",
    "wiercigroch and cheng @xcite have investigated the influence of noise on the orthogonal cutting system . in their analysis",
    "they started from the spectral representation of stochastic process .",
    "nevertheless , the most common treatment of dynamical processes influenced by noise is the fokker - plank approach @xcite . because of some considerable difficulties which it meets by solving in higher dimensions as well as for numerical reasons",
    "it could be transformed to the corresponding langevin equations @xcite . here ,",
    "following the papers @xcite , we use the stochastic langevin equations with an additive white noise and solve the dynamic equations of examined system .",
    "previous articles @xcite devoted to cutting process in presence of noise , focused rather on the problem of dynamics and possibilities of bifurcations induced by the random disturbances .",
    "interestingly , wiercigroch and cheng [ 8 ] and later przystupa and litak [ 11 ] , investigating orthogonal cutting process with two degrees of freedom , claimed that in some conditions weak noise can even stabilize the chaotic attractor . on the other hand paper @xcite deals with the reconstruction of the system dynamics from the stochastic time series . in their treatment",
    "the cutting process was assumed to be deterministic but the measured data were influenced by noise coming from the measurement procedure .",
    "our paper is also a contribution to a complicated problem of dynamics of a cutting process , but we focus on the final quality of a product surface , and in this context , in the stability of process .",
    "note , in fig .",
    "1 , the shape of an initial surface of a cut workpiece .",
    "the shape has numerous imperfections which we will model by random deviations from the ideal cylindrical surface . adopting a simple one degree - of - freedom model of regenerative cutting @xcite we included the effect of a previous pass of a straight turning process by a time delay term @xcite .",
    "the physical model of a straight turning process , corresponding to our experimental system , is presented in fig .",
    "we have introduced the following notations : @xmath0 is a relative velocity between the tool and the workpiece , @xmath1 is an assumed initial while @xmath2 an actual cutting depth ; @xmath3 is a principal axis of relative vibrations ; @xmath4 indicates the direction normal to the axis of a workpiece symmetry , @xmath5 is a tool cutting edge angle ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the stiffness and damping of the system respectively ; @xmath8 denotes a rotational velocity of a workpiece ; @xmath9 denotes the direction of feed in a straight turning ; m is the effective mass of the system .    the main vibration in @xmath3 direction , perpendicular to the cutting edge , ( fig .",
    "2 ) and to be precise we should analyze vibrations as well as cutting force in @xmath3 direction .",
    "however we are interested in the final surface profile given by the time history of @xmath4 and not by the actual profile @xmath3 . to analyze vibration in @xmath4",
    "we have done simultaneous projecting vibrations and forces into @xmath4 direction .",
    "thus the deterministic equation of motion of dynamical system , projected on a normal ( to final surface ) direction @xmath4 , can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a natural frequency of free vibrations of the workpiece @xmath12 while @xmath13 .",
    "nonlinearities , appearing in that system , are included in the @xmath14 function @xcite : @xmath15 \\left [ c_3 \\left ( \\frac{h}{h_0 } -1 \\right)^2 + 1 \\right ] \\frac{h}{h_0 } \\theta ( h ) { \\rm sgn } ( v_f).\\ ] ] cutting depth @xmath2 and relative velocity @xmath0 are defined @xcite : @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 correspond to step functions : heaviside and sign functions respectively and @xmath19 ia the linear velocity of a rotational motion of a workpiece during a steady cutting process .",
    "@xmath20 is the time of a previous pass : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a workpiece revolution time during machining .",
    "the shape of a nonlinear function @xmath14 ( eq .",
    "2 ) dependent on @xmath2 and @xmath0 is presented in fig .",
    "3 . note the two - dimensional surface @xmath23 was plotted only for positively defined @xmath2 . in case of negative @xmath2 , the force on the left hand side of eq .",
    "1 , is zero because of the contact loss between the tool and a workpiece .",
    "the sudden sign change of a cutting force in a function of relative velocity @xmath0 is due to a friction phenomenon between the tool and a chip .    our model ( eqs . 1 - 3 ) with one",
    "degree - of - freedom is a serious simplification of a physical situation .",
    "however our aim is not the comprehensive description of a cutting process .",
    "here we want to concentrate on particular aspects of it . in spite of simplicity of the examined model",
    "still allows the chatter vibrations to be generated due to the nonlinearities in of the cutting force @xmath24 as it was shown in paper @xcite . in our model chatter",
    "is generated by a combination of the friction phenomenon between the tool and chips , and the impact of a tool after loosing its contact with a workpiece .",
    "warmiski and others @xcite examined the second pass of the orthogonal cutting process by using similar model .",
    "the results obtained there have indicated that such model can lead to periodic , quasi - periodic as well as chaotic vibrations due to the initial harmonic modulation of the machined surface .    for a numerical calculation purpose we have written the equations ( eqs . 1 - 4 ) in discrete way introducing the constant time step @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a sampling discrete time after @xmath28 time steps .",
    "the function @xmath29 should be expressed : @xmath30 where @xmath28 and @xmath31 are natural numbers .",
    "the time difference between @xmath32 and @xmath33 coordinates ; @xmath34 relates to the time of workpiece revolution ( eq .",
    "the system parameters obtained from the experiment are following : @xmath35 rad / s , @xmath36 kg , @xmath37 n , @xmath38 m , @xmath39 m / rev , @xmath401/s , @xmath41 m / s @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 are cutting process constants derived from @xcite .",
    "most of real dynamical processes are disturbed by the random signal . in case of cutting process",
    "they come through the roughness of the initial surface ( fig .",
    "1 ) . other sources of such disturbances can be found in a spontaneous breaking of chips and the couplings of the tool and the workpiece to other dynamic parts of the experimental standing .    to describe the stochastic system we introduce to the model a random component by an additive white noise of gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "usually stochastic dynamic systems are investigated by using the fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "one dimension version of it reads : @xmath45 + d \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2 } p(y , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath46 denotes the diffusion coefficient , @xmath47 is , in general , the non - linear drift term ( driving force ) and @xmath48 the probability distribution function . as solving",
    "fokker - plank equation meets some considerable difficulties @xcite we have transformed it into the corresponding langevin equation : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a gaussian distributed random force with the strength @xmath51 and @xmath52 is assumed to satisfy : @xmath53 where the brackets denote an average over the probability distribution function .",
    "starting with the definitions of the drift @xmath54 and diffusion @xmath46 coefficients obtained by the kramers - moyal expansions in the derivation of fokker - plank equation from a chapman - kolmogorov equation @xcite , we can find the relation between @xmath55 and @xmath46 of the fokker - plank equation ( eq .",
    "7 ) with @xmath56 and @xmath51 of the langevin equation ( eq . 8) .",
    "thus the langevin equation can be finally expressed by drift and diffusion terms of the initial fokker - plank equation as : @xmath57 for the actual numerical calculation we have discretized form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a superposition of gaussian distributed random numbers which again are of a gaussian form .",
    "namely : @xmath60 in our case the average value of @xmath61 has been chosen as @xmath62 while its variance as @xmath63 , respectively . from the integration of the gaussian ( eq .",
    "12 ) the coefficient @xmath64 ( eq .",
    "13 ) depends on the time integration step @xmath25 via @xmath65 .",
    "equation 8 can be , in general , solved by higher order algorithms like runge - kutta one @xcite .",
    "however here , for simplicity , we have limited our discussion to the simplest algorithm of euler type .",
    "thus , the final form of the langevin equation in the lowest order perturbation , suitable for numerical integration is given by the following expression : @xmath66    here we analyzed the one - dimensional version of the langevin and fokker - plank equations .",
    "the similar discussion on the @xmath67-dimensional stochastic langevin equation and its relation to the corresponding fokker - plank equation can be found in @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "9 for @xmath32 has to be supplemented by the rest of equations ( eqs .",
    "5,6 ) for discrete time @xmath27 and velocity @xmath68 which is now substituted by the corresponding drift term @xmath69 :    @xmath70    using the above procedure ( eqs . 4,5 and eq .",
    "14 - 15 ) we have done the simulations for a constant time step @xmath71 s , corresponding to the workpiece revolution time @xmath72 s and a number of diffusion constants values @xmath46 .",
    "figures 4 a  d show the time histories of @xmath4 of initial 3 seconds of cutting work for experimentally identified system parameters ( sec .",
    "2 ) . for a deterministic system ( @xmath73 , fig .",
    "4a ) we observe the stable cutting process with no vibrations .",
    "figures 4b , c relate to cutting process in presence of noise .",
    "the diffusion constant values in these figures are @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "one can see easily the presence of small vibrations ( fig .",
    "4b ) , which are growing with increasing of the noise level ( fig .",
    "4c ) . obviously , such vibrations have a significant effect on the quality of a workpiece surface .",
    "it is shown in fig . 5 , where the error shape of a surface is plotted as a function of a workpiece rotation angle after 3 s of cutting work .",
    "modulation of shape caused by random disturbances depends on a noise level .",
    "both : input and output random signals can be easily measured by standard deviations . for various @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "we have got the following values of standard deviations : @xmath79 m , @xmath80 m and @xmath81 m. in figs .",
    "6a and b we have compared the input and output random signals for one of the above cases ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "figure 6a shows the distribution of gaussian disturbances of input noise @xmath61 ( eqs .",
    "8,9 ) while fig .",
    "6b corresponds to the errors of workpiece shape after cutting . in fig .",
    "6b deviation from the normal probability distribution is caused by nonlinear dynamics of the cutting process . to quantify the system answer we have used standard deviations of the output signal @xmath82 as a function of diffusion constant @xmath46 .",
    "it is plotted in the logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "we have checked that @xmath83 can be scaled as a square root as far as noise level is low while for stronger noise its effect on the fluctuations of @xmath4 is stronger .",
    "we have considered vibrations of a tool - workpiece system in a straight turning process induced by random disturbances and their effect on a product surface . using a single degree - of - freedom model we have focused on the combined effects of the friction nonlinearities and tool - workpiece contact loss .",
    "we have noticed that for large enough level of noise , the tool and a workpiece start to vibrate due to random forcing .",
    "such excitation can interact with a complex dynamics of the system leading to process non - stability and , in the end , to much worse final quality of the machined product . in case of a relatively small level of noise ( a small value of the diffusion constant @xmath46 )",
    "the surface shape error scales as a square root of @xmath46 . for a higher value of a noise level",
    "the shape error is proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , in a straight turning the initial surface roughness influence the quality of a final product .",
    "this is the principal result of our paper , which lead to a conclusion that one has to prepare workpiece which initial surface satisfies the appropriate criteria .    the work has been partially supported by polish state committee for scientific research ( kbn ) under the grant no .",
