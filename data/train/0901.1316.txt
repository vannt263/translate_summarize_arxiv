    "in large area microlensing surveys , one has to search for microlensing signatures in billions of variable sources .",
    "this is straightforward to do and computationally inexpensive in the point - source approximation .",
    "one either fits a paczy ' nski light curve @xcite , or , if appropriate , the gould high - amplification approximation for point sources @xcite . one major disadvantage of these point - source light curves is the infinite amplification for a lens exactly in front of the point source .",
    "@xcite extended paczy ' nski s light curve to finite sources which also avoids infinite amplifications .",
    "his equation describes the amplification as the two - dimensional integration of the paczy ' nski amplification over the circular source , assumed to have constant surface brightness .    using the limiting form of paczynski light curve under high amplification , gould is able to factor out the two - dimensional integral into point source amplification times a much simpler integral .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite obtained the finite source amplification directly from the lens equation by comparing the area of the source and its lensed images .",
    "however , one needs to take care of the singular points for the elliptic integrals of the first and the third kind when using their formula .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the same strategy as @xcite , because in this way more general surface - brightness profiles for the sources ( e.g. limb - darkened ones ) can be taken into account straightforwardly .",
    "for the cases of a uniform disk we will also compare our results with @xcite .",
    "the technical issue of the integration in the gould extended source formalism can be carried out in several different ways .",
    "the two straightforward ones are to use polar coordinates and to choose the coordinate center either ( 1 ) at the source center or ( 2 ) at the lens center .",
    "@xcite took the first choice . @xcite",
    "have shown for the very special case where the lens is positioned along the line of sight to the source that the integration can be solved very easily if the second option is chosen .",
    "this leads us to choose the lens center as the coordinate center in general to benefit from the more simple integrand",
    ". we will show ( in section 2 ) that in this way the amplification of a uniform circular source is reduced to a one - dimensional integral and can be computed numerically fast and stable by using the composite simpson s rule .",
    "a limb - darkened source is treated in section 3 .",
    "the two - dimensional integral can be solved numerically again in a fast and stable fashion , and light - curve fits for limb - darekened profiles can be obtained with the levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with less than 100 steps .",
    "we also allow for finite lens sizes in section 4 . as a test example",
    ", we apply our fitting methods to a macho @xcite event and an ogle ( the optical gravitational lensing experiment ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) event in section 5 .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "we first introduce our notation .",
    "let @xmath0 be the einstein radius of a point mass lens , and @xmath1 be the impact parameter of a point source",
    ". then one can write the amplification of the point source by the point mass lens as a function of the dimensionless impact parameter @xmath2 as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if the source is extended one can obtain the lensed flux and the total amplification by integrating @xmath4 over the source area , weighted by the surface - brightness profile of the source .",
    "we now derive the amplification for a circular source with radius @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the projected source size in units of the einstein radius @xmath0 and @xmath7 is the physical source size ) .",
    "the situation is sketched in figure  [ fig.fs_geometry ] .",
    "there are two cases : either the center of the lens @xmath8 ( projected along the line of sight ) is within the extended source centered at @xmath9 ( the left side of figure  [ fig.fs_geometry ] ) or the lens is outside the extended source ( the right side of figure  [ fig.fs_geometry ] ) , i.e. , either @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "one obtains the amplification of the extended uniform source by integrating the point - source amplification over the source area @xmath12 : @xmath13    using polar coordinates centered on the lens , one can write @xmath14    the integration boundaries @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xmath17    @xmath18    and so the amplification becomes @xmath19\\,d\\vartheta \\label{eq.afs } ~,\\ ] ] which can be approximated numerically using the composite simpson s rule with @xmath20(an even number ) grids : @xmath21 } & , u\\le{{\\rho}}\\\\ \\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{\\pi{{\\rho}}^2}\\frac{\\arcsin({{\\rho}}/u)}{n}\\left[\\frac{\\left(u+{{\\rho}}\\right)\\sqrt{\\left(u+{{\\rho}}\\right)^2 + 4}-\\left(u-{{\\rho}}\\right)\\sqrt{\\left(u-{{\\rho}}\\right)^2 + 4}}{3}+\\frac{2}{3}{\\sum\\limits}_{k=1}^{n/2 - 1}f\\left(\\frac{2k\\arcsin({{\\rho}}/u)}{n}\\right ) + \\frac{4}{3}{\\sum\\limits}_{k=1}^{n/2}f\\left(\\frac{(2k-1)\\arcsin({{\\rho}}/u)}{n}\\right ) \\right ] } & , u>{{\\rho}}\\\\      \\end{array }    \\right .",

    "thus we set a grid of @xmath26 for @xmath10 in order to have the same step size on both sides .",
    "@xcite argued that the finite - source effects are prominent only when the lens is very close to the source center ( @xmath27 ) , and thus one can approximate equation  ( [ eq.a_pac ] ) by    @xmath28    and the finite - source light curve can be obtained by solving elliptic integrals    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the elliptic integral of the second kind and @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 + we now compare our method for @xmath33 with previous ones , i.e. with @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and illustrate these comparisons in figures  [ fig.afs_example ] and [ fig.a_fs_zoomin ] .",
    "+ equation  ( [ eq.a_gould_elliptic_integrals ] ) and ( [ eq.theta_max ] ) allow a fast computation of finite - source light curves in the gould approximation , which however is accurate only for a high - amplification event .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig.afs_example ] , where for high amplifications ( right panel ) the gould finite - source approximation ( _ gray _ ) is very close to the @xcite light curve ( displayed in _ solid black _ ) , but fairly off when the lens transits the source for low amplifications ( left panel ) .    our formalism from equation  ( [ eq.afs ] ) and that of @xcite both provide the exact light curves for uniform extended sources .",
    "in the witt & mao formalism one has to evaluate an elliptic integral which shows singularity when the impact parameter @xmath34 is similar to the source size @xmath35 .",
    "witt & mao therefore derived a separate solution for the case of @xmath36 .",
    "this method is difficult to implement into numerical fitting routines in general , and particular cumbersome for those fast numerical fitting routines , where the partial derivatives have to be provided .",
    "we therefore suggest to start from our exact formalism given in equation  ( [ eq.afs ] ) and estimate values for the integral using equation  ( [ eq.a_discret ] ) with @xmath37 .",
    "the comparison with results from higher values for @xmath38 or the comparison with the @xcite formalism  see the _ gray _ and _ dash - dotted curves _ in figure  [ fig.a_fs_zoomin ]  shows that equation  ( [ eq.a_discret ] ) ( with @xmath37 ) provides a precise numerical estimate for the integral already .",
    "another advantage of our formalism is that one can obtain the derivatives of equation  ( [ eq.afs ] ) with respect to source radius @xmath5 and @xmath39 in a straightforward manner ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this enables us to use fitting routines as , e.g. , the levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which converge in this case in less than 100 iterations .",
    "the approximation by @xcite with @xmath40 evaluated according to equation  ( [ eq.a_pac ] ) is actually valid for all @xmath34 provided that @xmath41 , so it deviates from equation  ( [ eq.afs ] ) for larger source size .",
    "in fact , more than 80% ( 2548 out of 3153 ) of the microlensing events detected from the ogle experiment @xcite have maximum amplification @xmath42 10 ( see figure  [ fig.ogle ] ) .",
    "this highlights the necessity of a fast fitting routine for the moderate - amplification regime .",
    "we then compare the light - curve computation time of equation  ( [ eq.a_discret ] ) to gould s formalism ( see figure  [ fig.ct ] ) . with @xmath37 , equation  ( [ eq.a_discret ] )",
    "is about 38@xmath43 faster then gould s formalism when @xmath10 and is @xmath44 55@xmath43 faster when @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , our @xmath37 approximation turns out to be a practical fast fitting routine for both moderate- and high - amplification regimes .",
    "the next step towards a more precise microlensing light curve for extended sources is to account for limb darkening .",
    "since the darkening is increasing towards the edges of the source , the limb darkening brings finite - source light curves closer to the paczy ' nski light curve which can be considered as the most extreme limb - darkening model with a delta function .",
    "we use the one - parameter linear limb - darkening profile from @xcite for the surface brightness of the source , @xmath45 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the distance to the source center .",
    "@xmath47 is the limb - darkening coefficient , and depends on the wavelength range used for the observations .",
    "@xmath48 is the mean surface brightness of the source and defined as @xmath49    we implemented the limb - darkening effects in our finite - source light curve as follows :    @xmath50\\ ,      d\\tilde{u } \\,d\\vartheta ~.    \\end{array }    \\label{eq.a_fin_ld}\\ ] ]    equation  ( [ eq.a_fin_ld ] ) is still a double integral over @xmath51 and @xmath23 .",
    "but even here the divergent part cancels , and the function is numerically stable and can be evaluated using a small grid .",
    "the limb - darkening effects under moderate - amplification regime is shown in figure  [ fig.ld ] .",
    "given a finite - size lens , one can always find a time interval when the lens obscures the inner ( and the outer , depending on the lens size ) lensed image in the early rising stage and in the final declining stage of the light curve . in the following , we investigate how large this effect is depending on the lens size .",
    "@xcite derived the lens - modified amplification by calculating how much area is unobscured by the lens in the image plane .",
    "one has to solve for the image position by inverting the lens equation and one has to evaluate the image area from the image boundary using stokes theorem .",
    "depending on the source and lens radii , there are 7 different cases for the inner image and 6 cases for the outer image to be considered if one follows the derivation of agol .    here",
    "we show that the finite lens amplification of a finite source again can be much more easily evaluated if one uses the polar coordinates @xmath51 and @xmath23 again .",
    "first , we consider a lens with physical radius @xmath52 transiting the surface of the source .",
    "the light emitted at a given point from the source follows the lens equation @xmath53 which gives the position of the two images in the lens plane ( recall @xmath54 ) @xmath55 with amplifications @xmath56    here , @xmath57 denotes the outer image , and @xmath58 denotes the inner image in units of the einstein radius .",
    "the sum of @xmath59 and @xmath60 gives the paczy ' nski light curve .",
    "an image is unobscured if @xmath61 or @xmath62 holds , where @xmath63 is the lens radius in units of the einstein radius . following this criterium and figure  [ fig.lens05re ]",
    ", there exists an upper limit for @xmath64 and a lower limit for @xmath62 to be unobscured by the lens .",
    "therefore , we only need to consider these two limitations when integrating the amplification in equation  ( [ eq.a_fin ] ) :    @xmath65      \\tilde{u}\\,d\\tilde{u } \\,d\\vartheta \\\\ &    = \\frac{1}{\\pi{{\\rho}}^2 }     { \\int\\limits}_0^{\\pi } \\ ,     \\left [      \\left .",

    "when we implemented the finite - source fitting using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm , we recognized that a good set of initial values is needed to bring the algorithm to convergence . fitting a paczy ' nski light curve to derive these initial values for the finite - source fitting leads to very good results .",
    "the algorithm is stable and for an initial value of @xmath68 it converges within 100 iterations .",
    "@xcite were able to measure a microlensing light curve with finite - source effects in macho-1995-blg-30 .",
    "we extracted the data points from their paper and applied our finite - source fitting algorithms to them .",
    "fitting equation  ( [ eq.a_discret ] ) with @xmath37 to the data yields a perfect agreement ( see table  [ tab.fit ] and figure  [ fig.macho9530 ] ) with the parameters given in table 2 of @xcite :    .light - curve parameters for macho-1995-blg-30 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab.fit ]    @xcite then obtained the limb darkening coefficients of macho-1995-blg-30 utilizing spectroscopic information .",

    "<S> the goal of this paper is to provide a numerically fast and stable description for the microlensing amplification of an extended source ( either uniform or limb - darkened ) that holds in any amplification regime . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our method of evaluating the amplification can be implemented into a light - curve fitting routine using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the accuracy and computation times to previous methods that either work in the high - amplification regime only , or require special treatments due to the singularity of elliptic integrals .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also provide the equations including finite lens effects in microlensing light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our methods to the macho-1995-blg-30 and the ogle-2003-blg-262 events and obtain results consistent to former studies . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an upper limit for the ogle-2003-blg-262 event lens size .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that our method allows to simultaneously search for point - source and finite - source microlensing events in future large area microlensing surveys in a fast manner . </S>"
