    "@xcite proposed that neutron star mergers will be accompanied by macronovae ( kilonovae ) , which are optical  infrared transients powered by radioactive decay of the merger s debris .",
    "these macronovae are among the most promising electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational - wave merger events  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , macronova candidates have been discovered in the afterglows of several short gamma - ray bursts  @xcite .",
    "@xcite re - analyzed the afterglow light curves of historical nearby short gamma - ray bursts and suggested that macronovae are ubiquitous in short grbs afterglows .",
    "the radioactive heat generated by @xmath0-process nuclei play an essential role in powering macronovae .",
    "due to strong adiabatic cooling the ejecta s initial internal energy is practically negligible at the time that the ejecta become optically thin , i.e. when @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the optical depth and @xmath7 is the velocity of the ejecta .",
    "as we discuss later , with typical parameters the peak emission time is around a few days and hence this is the important timescale to focus on .",
    "detailed computations using nuclear database and numerical simulations have been widely used to obtain the radioactive heating rates  @xcite .    another approach to calculate the heating rate is to consider the @xmath0-process material as a statistical assembly of radioactive nuclei .",
    "incorporating fermi s theory of beta decay with such an approach provides a clear physical understanding of the nuclear heating rate  ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion on the energy generation by fission products ) .",
    "we follow this approach and use the fermi theory to estimate the heating rate in neutron star mergers ejecta .",
    "* see also @xcite ) considered this approach to estimate the radioactive luminosity of supernovae .",
    "but they used only the relativistic regime of fermi s theory , which is not relevant on the macronova peak timescale as we discuss later .",
    "furthermore , they assumed that each element decays to a stable one rather than following a decay chain , which we consider in this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we analytically derive the nuclear heating rate of macronovae based on fermi s theory . in   [ sec : summary ] , we begin with a brief summary of the basic concepts and the outcome of this work . in   [ sec : fermi ] , we introduce the key ingredients of the theory needed to calculate the heating rate .",
    "we derive the heating rate of the beta decay chains of allowed transitions in   [ sec : heat ] .",
    "we discuss , in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , the role of forbidden transitions and other effects that we ignore and we estimate their possible effect .",
    "we summarize the results and discuss the implication to macronova studies in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "radioactive nuclei that are far from the stability valley are produced in @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "these nuclei undergo beta decay without changing their mass number .",
    "a series of beta decays in each mass number is considered as a decay chain . because the mean lives of radioactive nuclides typically become longer when approaching the stability valley , the nuclei in a decay chain at given time @xmath8 stay at some specific nuclide with a mean life @xmath9 .",
    "this means that the number of decaying nuclei in a logarithmic time interval is constant , i.e , the decay rate is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total number of nuclei in the chain",
    ". then the beta decay heating rate per nucleus is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the disintegration energy of the beta decay as a function of the mean life .",
    "as we will see later , two important concepts in beta decay theory enable us to determine @xmath13 .",
    "first , there are four physical constants in the problem , the fermi s constant @xmath14 , the electron mass @xmath15 , the speed of light @xmath16 , and the planck constant @xmath17",
    ". the fundamental timescale of beta decay @xmath18s can be obtained from these physical constants .",
    "second , there is a well known relation between the disintegration energy and mean life as @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the heating rate per nucleus can be roughly estimated as @xmath20 this gives a correct order of magnitude and a reasonable estimate of the time dependence of the beta decay heating rate of @xmath0-process material . in the following we refine these ideas .",
    "the nature of beta decay was successfully described by @xcite . here",
    "we briefly describe key ingredients of fermi s theory needed for obtaining the macronova heating rate . in a beta decay one of the neutrons in a nucleus disintegrated to a proton , an electron , and an anti - neutrino . using fermi s golden rule ,",
    "the beta - disintegration probability of a beta - unstable nucleus per unit time in a unit momentum interval of the electron is written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are momentum and kinetic energy of the electron , @xmath24 is the matrix element of the interaction hamiltonian responsible for the beta disintegration , and @xmath25 is the number density of final states of the light particles between @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "the number of final states is assumed to be proportional to the volume of the accessible phase space of the light particles : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total disintegration energy , @xmath29 is momentum of the neutrino , and energy conservation @xmath30 has been used .",
    "we use the fact that the neutrino mass is sufficiently small compared to @xmath31 and assume that there is no angular correlation between the electron and neutrino . here",
    "we imagine that the whole system is enclosed in a large box with a volume @xmath32 .",
    "hereafter we change the notation as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in fermi s theory ,",
    "the four particles interact at a single point with a coupling constant @xmath14 so that the matrix element is written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the wave function of each particle involved in the beta disintegration , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are operators acting on the light particle s spin , nucleon s spin and isospin  ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussions on beta interaction ) .",
    "the wave function of the light particles can be evaluated at @xmath39 because their de broglie wavelengths are much larger than the nuclear size .",
    "when the light particles do not carry off orbital angular momentum with respect to the central nucleus , the wave function of each light particle at @xmath40 is just a normalization factor of @xmath41 with a coulomb correction for the electron s wave function .",
    "thus the square of the matrix element can be written as @xmath42 is the coulomb correction factor , @xmath43 is the proton number of the daughter nucleus , and @xmath44 is the nuclear matrix element .",
    "the transitions described here are _ allowed _ transition .",
    "more specifically , allowed transitions are transitions which satisfy both conditions that the light particles do nt carry off orbital angular momentum and the parity of the nucleus does not change via its disintegration .",
    "otherwise the transition is a _ forbidden _ transition .",
    "because the population of allowed transitions is larger and because of their simplicity , we focus on allowed transitions in this and the next sections",
    ". we will discuss the role of forbidden transitions in  4 .",
    "integrating eq .",

    "this enhances the transition probability at lower energies . at these energies",
    "the electron is pulled by the nucleus due to the coulomb force and the amplitude of the electron s wave function is larger near the nucleus . as a result ,",
    "the lifetime of beta unstable nuclei becomes shorter than the one estimated without the coulomb correction and the dependence of the lifetime on @xmath31 is weakened .",

    "the fraction of energy of the electrons to the total energy is : @xmath81 in the three regimes discussed earlier @xmath82 satisfies : @xmath83 where we assumed @xmath84 .",
    "neutron - rich nuclei produced via the @xmath0-process undergo beta decay towards the beta - stable valley without changing their mass number . a series of beta decays of nuclei in each mass number",
    "can be considered as a decay chain .",
    "here we consider ideal - chains of radioactive nuclei with a series of mean lives  ( @xmath85 ) , in which each chain conserves the total number of nuclei throughout the decay process and sufficiently many chains exist . within this approximation ,",
    "the number of decaying nuclei in a logarithmic time interval is constant and the beta decays at a given time @xmath8 are dominated by nuclides with mean - lives of @xmath9  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dn ] ) .",
    "this is , of course , valid for @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the mean life of the first nuclide in a decay chain .",

    "note that @xmath80 is the euler number , which arises from the fact that the decay rate of each nuclide is proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "one can obtain @xmath92 by using eq .",
    "( [ mean ] ) and ( 11 ) .    in the relativistic and non - relativistic coulomb regimes",

    "monotonically increases with decreasing @xmath31 , the relativistic regime is valid at early times and the non - relativistic coulomb regime is valid at late times .",
    "more specifically , the relativistic regime is valid until @xmath93 and the non - relativistic coulomb regime is valid after @xmath94 . using eqs .",
    "( [ f ] ) and ( [ e ] ) , we obtain the heating rate in these regimes : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is time in units of a day , @xmath97 is the mean mass number normalized by @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the mean proton number normalized by @xmath100 .",
    "note that the overall magnitude of the heating rate is determined by the mean values of the nuclear quantities , @xmath101 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "these values should be constant within an order of magnitude , and thus , the magnitude of the heating rate does not depend significantly on the details of the abundance pattern of the @xmath0-process nuclei .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize that the formula of eq .",
    "( [ heat2 ] ) is independent of the distribution of the nuclear decay energy .",
    "figure [ fig : heat ] depicts the heating rate obtained from eq .",
    "( [ heat ] ) and the one derived using a nuclear database  ( @xcite ; see also similar heating rates in @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the heating rate based on the simple analytic formula reproduces the one based on the database remarkably well . in order to see more details , the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : heat ] shows the heating rates normalized to the values obtained for the relativistic regime ( eq .",

    "the normalized analytic heating rate ( blue solid line ) is flat at early times and it approaches the non - relativistic coulomb regime ( magenta dotted line ) at late times .",
    "it is worthy noting that the formula with the non - relativistic coulomb limit reproduces the full heating rate after @xmath102s , even though it should be valid only after @xmath103s .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the mean life is approximately proportional to @xmath104 between the relativistic and the non - relativistic regimes , and thus , the energy generation rate evolves as @xmath105 .",
    "in addition , in this stage , @xmath106 changes from @xmath107 to @xmath108 , which approximately corresponds to @xmath109 . as a result , the electron heating rate is @xmath110 , which is quite similar to the one in the non - relativistic coulomb regime .",
    "note that @xcite and @xcite assume that a nucleus that undergoes a radioactive decay reaches the valley of stability in a single step . in this case",
    "the total number of radioactive nuclei decreases with time .",
    "this assumption is valid if the radioactive nuclei are distributed just next to the stable nuclei , i.e. , at late times .",
    "under such an assumption , the resulting heating rate declines more steeply as @xmath111 in the relativistic regime . as we will discuss in the next section",
    ", the actual situation is in between these two assumptions .",
    "the analytic formula derived in the previous section reproduces remarkably well the result based on the nuclear database . however , there are two important effects that have not been taken into account . here",
