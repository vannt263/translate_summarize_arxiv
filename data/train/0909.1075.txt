    "exotic superconducting state with nontrivial cooper pairing in heavy fermion systems continues to be a central focus of investigations in strongly correlated electron systems.@xcite among them , uru@xmath0si@xmath0 has mystified researchers since the heavy fermion superconductivity occurs deep inside the mysterious ` hidden order ' state whose transition temperature is @xmath11 = 17.5k.@xcite    several salient features of the superconducting state have been reported in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . according to several experimental observations , most of the carriers ( @xmath1290% ) disappear below @xmath11,@xcite resulting in a semimetallic electronic structure with a density one order of magnitude smaller than in other heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "superconductivity with such a low density is remarkable since the superfluid density is very low in some way reminiscent of underdoped cuprates ; the superconductivity by itself is an exceptional case of pairing among heavy electrons with a long fermi - wavelength in a nearly semimetallic system .",
    "moreover , pressure studies revealed that the superconductivity coexists with the hidden order phase having no intrinsic magnetic order but can not coexist with the antiferromagnetic order with large magnetic moment,@xcite in contrast with other heavy fermion compounds where the superconductivity often coexists with magnetic orders .",
    "thus , although the genuine hidden order parameter is still an open question , the hidden order may provide an intriguing stage for a new type of unconventional superconducting state .    despite these studies ,",
    "very little is known about the exotic superconducting state of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , mainly because the superconductivity is extremely sensitive to disorder.@xcite recent studies using ultraclean single crystals with very large residual - resistivity - ratio ( @xmath13 ) have enabled us to develop an advanced understanding about the superconducting state of uru@xmath0si@xmath0.@xcite a number of unprecedented superconducting properties have been reported , including superconductor - insulator - like first - order transition at upper critical field @xmath14,@xcite flux line lattice melting at sub - kelvin temperatures @xcite and quantum transport of quasiparticles.@xcite moreover , it has been shown that below @xmath11 the nearly perfect compensation ( equal number of electrons and holes ) is realized.@xcite according to the quantum oscillation,@xcite electronic transport,@xcite specific heat @xcite and thermal conductivity measurements,@xcite the presence of the light spherical hole band and anisotropic heavy electron band has been suggested .",
    "this indicates that uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is an essentially multiband superconductor .",
    "recent angle - resolved thermal conductivity and specific heat measurements have suggested two distinct superconducting gap structures having different nodal topology with horizontal line nodes in the hole band and point nodes in the electron band.@xcite from the group symmetry analysis , a chiral @xmath15-wave state with a form , @xmath16 has been proposed , which breaks time reversal symmetry ( trs).@xcite    up to some years ago , the only known condensate with broken trs was the @xmath17-phase of superfluid @xmath18he .",
    "more recently , several candidates of unconventional superconducting phases which break trs have been reported in several classes of strongly correlated materials , including ruthenate sr@xmath0ruo@xmath19,@xcite filled skutterudite pros@xmath19sb@xmath20,@xcite and u - based heavy fermion compounds , upt@xmath7 @xcite and u@xmath8th@xmath9be@xmath10.@xcite in these materials , muon spin relaxation measurements in zero field reveal the development of spontaneous magnetic moment below @xmath5 and in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath19 , nonzero kerr rotation has been reported.@xcite theoretically , it is predicted that in a superconductor with multicomponent order parameter , chiral domain walls separating different degenerate superconducting states are formed.@xcite then the system should spontaneously generate supercurrents at the edge and the domain walls . moreover , it is proposed that these chiral domains should strongly influence the vortex penetration especially at low fields.@xcite these chiral domains and low - field magnetic response in unconventional superconductors with broken trs have been explored by several experimental techniques,@xcite however there is no direct evidence of such anomalies in the supercurrents as well as vortex penetration .    in this paper , to shed further light on the exotic superconducting properties of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , we investigated the low - field diamagnetic response of ultraclean single crystals .",
    "the results provide strong evidence for the highly unusual superconducting state of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 embedded in the hidden order state .",
    "high - quality single crystals of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 with @xmath21 were grown by the czochralski pulling method in a tetra - arc furnace.@xcite the well defined superconducting transition was confirmed by the specific heat measurements .",
    "experiments have been performed on single crystals with typical dimensions of @xmath22mm@xmath18 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "3 ) down to 55mk by using a dilution refrigerator .    the standard technique to determine the lower critical field @xmath1 is to measure the dc magnetization in the bulk crystals",
    ". however , reliable determination of @xmath1 is a difficult task in the presence of the flux pinning and magnetic relaxation . to avoid these difficulties , we determined @xmath1 by directly detecting the positional dependence of the field @xmath23 at which flux penetration occurs from the edge of the crystal.@xcite to measure the local magnetic induction , we used micro hall sensors tailored in a gaas / algaas heterostructure.@xcite    first we studied the pinning properties in the crystals by measuring the magnetic field distribution in the vortex state , which is obtained by the scanning micro hall sensor with an active area of @xmath24@xmath25m@xmath26 .",
    "the hall sensor was scanned on the surface area of the crystal by using the piezoelectric device .",
    "the distance between the hall sensor and the crystal surface was kept constant by monitoring the tunneling currents .",
    "next we measured the local magnetic induction very precisely by using a miniature hall - sensor array with each active area of @xmath27@xmath25m@xmath26 ( the center - to - center distance of neighboring sensors is 20@xmath25 m ) .",
    "the crystal was directly placed on top of the array ( see the inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) ) .    in both measurements ,",
    "earth magnetic field was shielded by @xmath25-metal .",
    "the residual field at the sample space is less than 0.5@xmath25 t . in all measurements ,",
    "the external field was applied after the sample was zero - field cooled to the desired temperature from the temperature above @xmath5 .",
    "near the edge region of the crystal , which is determined by the scanning hall - probe microscopy .",
    "the dashed line is the position of the edge ( for details , see the text . )",

    "the profile is measured by the scanning hall - probe microscopy . with approaching from the outside of the crystal ,",
    "the magnetic induction is enhanced to @xmath32 @xmath12 0.08mt followed by a sharp drop near the edge of the crystal .",
    "the induction is perfectly screened inside the crystal .",
    "here we defined the edge at the peak of the local magnetic induction , as shown by the dotted line .",
    "the enhancement of the magnetic induction at the edge is due to the field induced by the meissner shielding currents flowing the edge region.@xcite the perfect screening is achieved in a short distance at @xmath33@xmath25 m just below @xmath5 , where @xmath15 is the distance from the edge .",
    "this demonstrates the homogeneous superconducting state of the crystal ,     measured by the sensor at the edge of the crystal ( sensor 2 ) , as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath2@xmath3 .",

    "( c ) display the distribution of the local magnetic induction at several external magnetic fields associated with the flux penetration at @xmath34k .",
    "the magnetic induction decays monotonically with the distance @xmath15 from the edge .",
    "this indicates the bean critical state dominated by the bulk flux pinning . in this case , @xmath1 is determined from the local magnetic induction near the edge , at which the first flux penetration is most sensitively detected.@xcite this is in contrast to the case when the geometrical surface barrier ( determined by sample shape ) is important rather than bulk pinning , in which the magnetic flux distribution shows a dome - like shape and the flux penetration field can be detected at the center of the crystal.@xcite    the positional dependence of the local magnetic induction @xmath35 were measured accurately by using the hall - sensor array near the edge for @xmath2@xmath3 and @xmath2@xmath4 .",
    "the sample edge is located between the hall sensors 1 and 2 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "2 ) , which is confirmed by the meissner response of each sensor , as shown in fig .",
    "in fact , sensor 2 exhibits a perfect meissner response , while slight enhancement of @xmath32 from @xmath28 is observed in sensor 1 .",
    "figures2(a ) and ( b ) display the field dependence of @xmath35 measured by sensor 2 . the flux penetration fields @xmath23 shown by the triangles are clearly resolved by the deviation from the meissner state ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the inset of fig.2(b ) depicts the positional dependence of @xmath23 .",
    "obviously @xmath23 is position - independent at sensors 2 and 3 which locate close to the edge ( @xmath37 m ) even at low temperatures . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath23 is enhanced at sensors 4 and 5 , which locate at @xmath38@xmath25 m , at low temperatures .",
    "these results again represent the bean critical state in this crystal and assure that we can accurately determine @xmath1 from @xmath23 measured by sensors near the edge .",
    "si@xmath0 used in the present study .",
    "local magnetic induction is measured at the edge regions a , b , and c. main panel : temperature dependence of the lower critical fields @xmath1 for @xmath2@xmath3 ( solid squares ) and @xmath2@xmath4 ( solid circles ) , which are determined at the edge region b shown in the inset .",
    "arrows indicate a kink anomaly at @xmath39 = 1.2k and a cusp behavior at @xmath40 @xmath41 1k .",
    "the dotted lines are the fits to the linear dependence .",
    "open circles and open squares show @xmath42 determined at the edge regions a and c shown in the inset , respectively.,width=325 ]    figure3 depicts the temperature dependence of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath43 and @xmath45 are the lower critical fields for @xmath2@xmath3 ( @xmath2@xmath4 ) , respectively .",
    "we evaluate @xmath46 and @xmath47 by using the expression @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the width and the thickness of the crystal , respectively , for a platelet sample.@xcite this expression takes into account the geometrical effect in an nonellipsoidal shape , where the demagnetization effect in ideal ellipsoids is modified.@xcite the magnetic penetration depth is evaluated from @xmath1 to @xmath51 @xmath25 m , which is quantitatively consistent with the @xmath25sr results of @xmath52 @xmath25m.@xcite according to the ginzburg - landau theory , the temperature dependence of @xmath1 anisotropy , @xmath53 , may be different from that of @xmath14 in multiband superconductors.@xcite at @xmath54 , however , @xmath55 should coincide with the @xmath14 anisotropy .",
    "the experimentally determined @xmath56 close to @xmath57 is then fully consistent with the reported @xmath14 anisotropy near @xmath5,@xcite giving us confidence in the accuracy of the result . as seen in fig .  3",
    ", @xmath43 increases linearly below @xmath58  k with decreasing temperature .",
    "a cusp structure can be seen at @xmath591  k. meanwhile , @xmath44 increases steeply below @xmath5 and increases linearly after exhibiting a distinct change in the slope with a kink at @xmath60  k. as shown by the dotted lines , @xmath44 at low temperatures increases linearly down to 55mk , while @xmath43 exhibits a tendency to saturation below 200mk .",
    "first we discuss the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath1 in the low temperature regime .",
    "since @xmath1 is proportional to the superfluid density , the @xmath30-linear dependence of @xmath44 down to low temperatures indicates the presence of line nodes in the superconducting gap function .",
    "moreover , the tendency to saturation in @xmath61 below 200mk indicates that the line nodes are located parallel to the @xmath31 planes ( horizontal node ) .",
    "this is because the supercurrents always flow parallel to the nodal planes for @xmath2@xmath4 , while for @xmath2@xmath3 supercurrents have a component which flows across the horizontal nodes .",
    "this component is perpendicular to the velocities of the quasiparticles around the nodes , which reduces the contributions of nodal quasiparticles to the superfluid density . since in the multiband superconductors the penetration depth and hence the lower critical field",
    "are governed by the band with light mass , it is natural to consider that the horizontal line node locates in the spherical light hole band .",
    "this is consistent with the previous results of angle - resolved thermal conductivity.@xcite    most remarkable features are anomalies at @xmath39 for @xmath2@xmath4 and @xmath40 for @xmath2@xmath3 . in the specific heat measurements , no anomaly has been observed at @xmath40 in the present crystals with large @xmath13 values .",
    "however , a peak structure in the heat capacity has been reported in the vicinity of @xmath40 for crystals with @xmath62 100 , possibly due to the inhomogeneous distribution of @xmath5.@xcite therefore we can not rule out a possibility that the observed @xmath40-anomaly in @xmath43 is due to a tiny portion with low-@xmath5 phase in the crystal . on the other hand , no anomaly has been reported in the heat capacity at @xmath39 for any crystals , indicating no evidence of the low-@xmath5 phase as an origin for the @xmath39-anomaly .",
    "it is also highly unlikely that the anomaly at @xmath39 arises from the inhomogeneous flux penetration of the crystal , because of the following reasons .",
    "first , the open squares and circles in fig .  3 show @xmath44 determined at different edge regions in the same crystal .",
    "the distinct kink anomaly at @xmath39 is quite well reproduced .",
    "second , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the meissner shielding currents flow homogeneously and the crystal has well defined edge .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that the anomaly of @xmath42 at @xmath39 is intrinsic .",
    "we stress that the anomaly at @xmath39 has never been reported in the crystals with lower @xmath13 values.@xcite     ( symbols ) with ( a ) @xmath63 and ( b ) @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines indicate the superfluid densities for the hole band with @xmath65 and the electron band with @xmath66 , respectively , which are obtained by assuming the illustrated nodal topologies suggested by the thermal conductivity measurements.@xcite the solid thick and thin lines represent the results of the two - gap fitting and the calculations for other gap symmetries , respectively.,width=325 ]    now we try to fit the temperature dependence of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in accordance with the multiband model .",
    "recent angle - resolved thermal conductivity and specific heat measurements revealed two distinct superconducting gap structures having different nodal topology with horizontal line nodes in the hole band and point nodes in the electron.@xcite to see whether multiband effect can explain anomalous behaviors of the lower critical fields , we discuss the temperature dependence of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in terms of the two - gap model below .",
    "in the two - band model , the in - plane and out - of - plane superfluid density normalized by their values at @xmath67k , @xmath64 and @xmath68 , respectively , can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the normalized superfluid density of hole and electron bands , respectively .",
    "@xmath72 is the ratio of the electron and hole contributions given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fermi velocity of holes ( electrons).@xcite the hole mass determined by the dhva measurements is nearly isotropic @xmath75,@xcite where @xmath76 @xmath77 is the mass of the hole along the @xmath49 @xmath78 axis and @xmath79 is the free electron mass .",
    "the heavy electron mass is anisotropic and is estimated to be @xmath80 and @xmath81 from the large sommerfeld coefficient in the heat capacity ( @xmath82mj / k@xmath26mol ) @xcite and the anisotropy of upper critical field @xmath14.@xcite then we obtain @xmath83 0.87 and @xmath84 0.95 .",
    "since theses values are close to unity , the superfluid density , particularly its temperature dependence at low temperatures , is governed by the hole band .",
    "this again provides a strong support to the horizontal line nodes located on the hole bands as mentioned before .",
    "moreover , the presence of point nodes has been suggested along the @xmath29 axis in the heavy electron bands.@xcite then , we calculate the superfluid density by assuming the gap functions @xmath85 with point and horizontal line nodes for hole bands and @xmath86 with @xmath29-axis point nodes for electron bands .",
    "the normalized lower critical fields , @xmath87 , are related to the superfluid density as @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "first we try to fit @xmath90 .",
    "because the hole band dominates at low temperatures , @xmath91 can be determined by @xmath90 .",
    "the best fit is obtained by @xmath92 and @xmath93 . as shown by the thick line in fig.4(a ) , the fitting result reproduces well the overall temperature dependence of @xmath90 , including the observed tendency toward saturation at low temperatures .",
    "we note that this @xmath94 value is close to @xmath95 , which is obtained from @xmath96 m/s @xcite and @xmath97 nm . here",
    "@xmath98 is the coherence length of the hole band estimated from the  virtual upper critical field \" of the hole band @xmath99t.@xcite in fig.4(b ) , @xmath100 calculated by using the same @xmath94 and @xmath101 values is plotted by the thick line . in sharp contrast to @xmath90 ,",
    "the calculation strongly deviates from the data .",
    "we tried to fit the data by assuming various @xmath94 and @xmath101 values and other gap symmetries , but could not reproduce the data , particularly the anomaly at @xmath39 .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that the multigap effect can not be an origin of the anomaly at @xmath39 .",
    "although a change in the slope of @xmath6 has been reported in upt@xmath7 @xcite and ( u@xmath8th@xmath102)be@xmath10,@xcite there are crucial differences from our observation .",
    "first , in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xmath6 is strongly suppressed below @xmath39 , while in upt@xmath7 and ( u@xmath8th@xmath102)be@xmath10 @xmath6 is enhanced below the kink temperature .",
    "second , in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 the kink anomaly is observed solely for @xmath2@xmath4 , while in upt@xmath7 and ( u@xmath8th@xmath102)be@xmath10 the anomaly is observed in any field directions . in the latter compounds ,",
    "the kink anomaly has been attributed to the transition into another superconducting phase with different gap structure .",
    "the observed strong suppression of @xmath42 indicates the drastic change of the vortex entry to the sample at @xmath39 . here",
    "we try to explain qualitatively this anomalous behavior of @xmath6 in terms of a peculiar vortex dynamics associated with chiral domains due to the multicomponent superconducting order parameter with broken trs .",
    "it is natural to consider that the superconducting order parameter couples to the hidden order , because the superconductivity appears only in the hidden order phase as shown by recent pressure studies.@xcite to discuss the pairing state in the presence of the hidden order , we investigate the dimensionless ginzburg - landau free energy which describes the pairing state with @xmath103 form at zero magnetic field and low temperature , @xmath104 here the order parameter is written as @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the order parameters having @xmath108 and @xmath109 symmetry , respectively .",
    "when the system has a four - fold rotation symmetry in the @xmath31 plane , these pairing states must have the same transition temperature , and @xmath110 .",
    "then , the trs is spontaneously broken just below @xmath111 within the bcs theory since @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "one the other hand , the four - fold rotation symmetry may be broken by the hidden order which occurs at @xmath11 = 17.5  k. when this is true , the transition temperature of the @xmath108 state differs from that of the @xmath109 state , namely @xmath114 .",
    "( we can assume @xmath115 without loss of the generality . ) then , the pairing state without broken trs @xmath116 is stable just below @xmath111 and the second - order phase transition to the pairing state @xmath117 occurs at @xmath118 the trs is broken at this second superconducting transition .",
    "assuming @xmath119 , the order parameter with broken trs can produce domain walls along the @xmath29 axis at @xmath39 . as suggested in ref .",
    "30 , magnetic fields then can penetrate inside through the domain wall even in the meissner state . thus the formation of domain walls gives rise to a peculiar reduction of the penetration field only for @xmath2 @xmath4 . as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , our scanning hall probe detects no apparent inhomogeneous field distribution , which implies that such domains , if exist , are smaller than the size of hall sensor ( @xmath120 m ) .",
    "we also note that the kink anomaly at @xmath39 has never been observed in the crystals with low @xmath13 values,@xcite implying that the domain formation is sensitive to the impurities .",
    "it should be noted that a possible presence of such a domain structure , which influences the vortex dynamics , has been suggested in upt@xmath7 , u@xmath8th@xmath102be@xmath10 , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath19 and pros@xmath19sb@xmath20.@xcite    the second superconducting transition discussed here is similar to the transition from the @xmath121-wave pairing state with trs to the chiral @xmath121-wave state without trs which has been proposed for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath19.@xcite the four - fold rotation symmetry is broken by the in - plane magnetic field in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath19 , while the hidden order may spontaneously break the four - fold rotation symmetry in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 without applying any external field .",
    "we note that local four - fold symmetry breaking in the hidden order phase has been recently proposed theoretically.@xcite",
    "we have determined accurately the lower critical fields of ultraclean uru@xmath0si@xmath0 by the positional dependence of the local magnetic induction .",
    "the lower critical fields exhibit several distinct features , which have never been observed in any other superconductors .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath1 at low temperatures suggests the horizontal line nodes in the energy gap in the light hole band .",
    "we show that the whole @xmath6 for @xmath2@xmath3 can be explained by the two gaps with line and point nodes , which is consistent with the previous reports . in sharp contrast , for @xmath2@xmath4 we find a distinct kink in the slope of @xmath6 at 1.2k , which can not be accounted for by the two gaps .",
    "this anomalous low - field diamagnetic response has been discussed in the light of the multicomponent order parameter with broken trs .",
