    "left - right symmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) based on the gauge group @xcite @xmath6 have many attractive features .",
    "these include an understanding of the origin of parity violation , and a compelling rationale for small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the enlarged gauge symmetry allows for parity to be defined as an exact symmetry , which is broken only spontaneously .",
    "right  handed neutrino is required to exist in order to complete the @xmath7 multiplet , and so neutrino mass is natural . in the domain of flavor physics , the supersymmetric version of this theory",
    "resolves several problems of the popular minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) : * ( i ) * @xmath1parity emerges as an exact symmetry of mssm , preventing rapid proton decay and providing a naturally stable dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "this is possible if the @xmath8 gauge symmetry is broken down to @xmath9 by higgs triplet fields carrying @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath1parity , which is part of the original @xmath11 symmetry , will remain unbroken even after symmetry breaking in this case . *",
    "( ii ) * it solves the susy cp problem @xcite because of parity invariance .",
    "parity makes the yukawa couplings and the corresponding susy breaking @xmath12 terms hermitian , and the gluino mass and the @xmath2 term real .",
    "the electric dipole moments of fermions will then vanish at the scale of parity restoration . *",
    "( iii ) * finally , it has all the ingredients necessary to solve the strong cp problem without the need for an axion , again by virtue of parity symmetry @xcite . this is achieved by ensuring that the quark mass matrix has a real determinant , which is possible since the yukawa couplings are hermitian .",
    "previous studies of this model focussed on two versions : ( i ) a tev scale version where @xmath1parity is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the right  handed sneutrino @xcite , or alternatively ( ii ) an @xmath1parity conserving version @xcite where non - renormalizable ( nr ) higher dimensional operators were included and played an essential role .",
    "the reason for considering only these two versions is that in the absence of the above features , i.e. , @xmath13 , or the presence of nr operators , the global minimum of the theory that is both @xmath1parity conserving and parity violating , breaks electric charge and is therefore unacceptable . in the first version with @xmath14",
    ", the @xmath15 scale must necessarily be in the tev range @xcite , whereas in the second one , it is necessarily above @xmath16 gev . in the first version ,",
    "susy dark matter candidate is lost . in the second version",
    ", the possibility of solving strong cp problem via parity symmetry is eliminated due to the essential presence of higher dimensional operators which makes @xmath17 large .",
    "it is also difficult to solve the susy phase problem , since these higher dimensional operators typically generate parity violating effects in the fermion mass matrices .",
    "extensions of the minimal model which use additional higgs multiplets have been proposed .",
    "@xcite introduces higgs doublets in addition to triplets , but in such models @xmath1parity conservation is exterior to parity symmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath18 higgs triplets are introduced in addition to the @xmath19 triplets , which is clearly non  minimal .    in this note",
    "we revisit the minimal susylr model with @xmath0 higgs triplets .",
    "we assume that the higher dimensional operators are absent or small , so that the solutions to the strong cp and the susy phase problems are still intact . the global minimum of the tree ",
    "level higgs potential is either charge violating , or @xmath1parity violating , as noted .",
    "however , we find that inclusion of the heavy majorana neutrino yukawa couplings in the effective potential automatically cures this problem",
    ". the vacuum that preserves both electric charge and @xmath1parity can naturally be the global minimum of the full potential .",
    "we study the consequences of such a setup .",
    "the main results of our investigation can be summarized as follows : * ( i ) * in this general class of models , there are two doubly charged higgs and higgsino fields with masses below a tev .",
    "one combination of these doubly charged higgs boson fields has a vanishing mass at the scale of @xmath20 breaking ( denoted as @xmath21 ) .",
    "so its mass is calculable , arising through renormalization group effects between @xmath21 and the weak scale .",
    "we find its squared mass to be positive with the higgs boson having a mass close to the bino mass . *",
    "( ii ) * there exist two pairs of higgs doublets in the low energy , although one pair is unlikely to be observed directly at the lhc .",
    "this naturally leads to calculable flavor violation , which are within experimental limits . *",
    "( iii ) * renormalization group evolution plays a crucial role in the generation of quark mixing angles .",
    "in fact , an asymmetry in the @xmath2 terms of the higgs doublets generated by the leptonic yukawa couplings is what induces ckm mixings . *",
    "( iv ) * in the version that solves the susy phase and the strong cp problems and which provides an understanding of the @xmath2 problem , there are also light @xmath3 triplet superfields with tev to sub - tev scale masses with interesting collider signature @xcite .",
    "these fields couple to left  handed leptons with the couplings proportional to the heavy majorana neutrino masses .",
    "quarks and leptons in the model have the following left - right symmetric assignment under the @xmath22 gauge group . @xmath23",
    "the minimal higgs sector consists of the following superfields : @xmath24 this is the minimal higgs system in the following sense .",
    "the @xmath25 fields are needed for @xmath20 symmetry breaking without inducing @xmath1parity violating couplings .",
    "the @xmath26 fields are their left  handed partners needed for parity invariance .",
    "two bidoublet fields @xmath27 are needed in order to generate quark and lepton masses and ckm mixings .",

    "@xmath35 fields have charge @xmath36 , @xmath28 has charge @xmath37 , and all other fields have charge zero with @xmath38 carrying charge @xmath37 .",
    "while the general setup of the minimal model includes @xmath34 , the special case of @xmath39 is interesting , as it leads to an understanding of the @xmath2 term . in the supersymmetric limit ,",
    "the vev of the singlet @xmath28 is zero , but after susy breaking , @xmath40 .",
    "thus the @xmath2 term for the bidoublet @xmath41 will arise from the coupling @xmath42 , with a magnitude of order @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "it is also in the limit where @xmath39 that the susy cp problem and the strong cp problem can be explained naturally .",
    "the main difference between the cases @xmath44 and @xmath39 from the low energy perspective is that in the latter case the left  handed triplet superfields @xmath26 will remain light , also with masses of order @xmath43 .",
    "the superpotential of eq .",
    "( 3 ) is invariant under the parity transformation under which @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , etc .",
    "parity invariance implies that the yukawa coupling matrices @xmath52 are hermitian , i.e. @xmath53 , etc .",
    "additionally , @xmath42 are real , as is @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the effective @xmath2 terms of the bidoublet will be real , provided that @xmath55 is real .",
    "if the @xmath41 vevs are also real , this setup will provide a solution to the susy cp problem and the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "below we will study under what conditions this is achieved and what the implications of this theory are .",
    "we will work in the ground state corresponding to the following charge preserving vev pattern for the triplet fields . @xmath56",
    "the vevs of the left  handed triplet fields @xmath57 are assumed to be zero since no interaction in the model induces such vevs .",
    "there are two important implications of this setup : * ( i ) * above the parity breaking scale @xmath58 , this model has an enhanced global @xmath59 ( complexified @xmath60 ) symmetry which is broken by the above vevs to @xmath61 .",
    "this leads to five massless superfields .",
    "three of these superfields are absorbed by the gauge fields via the super ",
    "higgs mechanism .",
    "there remains two light superfields , which are the doubly charged higgs and higgsino fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "these fields will consistently acquire masses of order tev or less , as we shall explicitly show in the next section . even after soft susy breaking terms are turned on , there is a @xmath60 symmetry in the potential , which leads to one massless doubly charged higgs boson ( and its conjugate ) .",
    "this field will acquire positive squared mass from the renormalization group evolution below @xmath21 proportional to the bino mass @xmath64 . *",
    "( ii ) * the bi - doublet fields , when expressed in terms of the components @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , have a symmetric mass matrix in @xmath38 due to parity symmetry which requires @xmath67 .",
    "( when @xmath39 , @xmath68 . ) therefore , if we make one pair of doublets light at the scale @xmath21 , it would lead to vanishing ckm mixing angle .",
    "this happens in spite of having two yukawa coupling matrices .",
    "consistency then requires that both pairs of doublets be light below @xmath21 . in this case rge extrapolation brings in an asymmetry between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "thus , not only are the potential problems solved by rge extrapolation , but the resulting scenario becomes very predictive .",
