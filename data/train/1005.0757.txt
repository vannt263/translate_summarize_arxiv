    "standard methods , originally established for time - independent quantum systems , have been adapted to the demands of time - periodic systems  @xcite .",
    "the final state of the relaxation process has so far not received as much attention as transient phenomena , although this can be ranked as even more fundamental and is in fact a core question of statistical mechanics .",
    "the usual thermodynamic concepts for the equilibrium state of time - independent systems are not applicable , such as the canonical distribution of boltzmann weights , reached in the stationary limit of a time - independent system that is weakly coupled to a heat bath .",
    "the boltzmann weights @xmath4 of the eigenstates are unique functions of the eigenenergy with the temperature @xmath5 of the heat bath as the only relevant parameter , whereas microscopic details of the weak coupling play no role . such a stationary limit , in the sense of convergence to time - independent values for all dynamical variables , is not encountered in a periodically driven system , where energy is permanently exchanged between the driven system and the environment .",
    "instead , the relaxation process finally leads to an asymptotic state that adopts the periodicity of the driving , and that in general depends on the microscopic details of the coupling .",
    "the density operator of the time - periodic subsystem is best represented in the floquet state basis .",
    "the floquet states are quasi - periodic solutions of the schrdinger equation for the time - periodic hamiltonian without the coupling to the environment . in the floquet basis",

    "a related problem occurs at avoided crossings , which are ubiquitous in the quasienergy spectra of generic floquet systems , since the quasienergies are bounded within a finite interval , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the driving frequency and @xmath8 is the driving period . as a consequence , the number of avoided crossings grows without limit for increasing hilbert - space dimension , leading to a breakdown of the adiabatic theorem  @xcite . in the presence of a heat bath",
    "this problem is approached in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is shown that the reduced density operator @xmath3 is not affected by a small avoided crossing , provided that it is smaller than a specific effective coupling parameter and so is not ` resolved ' by the heat bath .",
    "these findings justify the unevitable truncation of the , in general , infinite hilbert space dimension in numerical implementations .",
    "one way to tackle the general challenge of finding the floquet occupations beyond their numerical evaluation is to study the semiclassical regime of one - dimensional driven systems . in their classical limit",
    "regular and chaotic motions generically coexist .",
    "this is most clearly reflected in phase space , where regular trajectories evolve on invariant tori and chaotic trajectories fill the remaining phase - space regions . according to the semiclassical eigenfunction hypothesis  @xcite",
    "almost all floquet states can be classified as either regular or chaotic , provided that the phase - space regions are larger than the planck constant .",
    "the regular states localize on the regular tori and the chaotic states typically spread out over the chaotic region . for a driven particle in a box coupled to a heat bath",
    "the floquet occupations of regular and chaotic states were found to follow different statistical distributions  @xcite .",
    "the regular states , which in this example differ only slightly from the eigenstates of the undriven system , carry almost boltzmann weights , whereas all chaotic states have nearly the same occupation probability .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on situations characteristic for strong driving , where both phase space and floquet states are strongly perturbed compared to the originally time - independent system .",
    "we demonstrate that the floquet occupations of the states in a regular island under these conditions deviate considerably from the boltzmann result . for kicked systems",
    ", making use of some reasonable assumptions , we derive an analytical expression for the regular occupations . in many cases",
    "it can be well approximated by weights of the boltzmann type @xmath9 .",
    "this requires the introduction of the regular energies @xmath1 , which are semiclassical invariants of the quantizing tori of the regular island , and the parameter @xmath2 , which is an effective temperature depending on the winding number of the regular island .",
    "furthermore , we give an overview and interpretation for the occupations of other typical floquet states in a mixed phase space , such as states on a resonance island chain , beach states , and hierarchical states .",
    "avoided crossings in the floquet spectrum can lead to severe changes in the occupations if they are larger than an effective coupling parameter .",
    "the effect can be intuitively explained by a set of effective rate equations with an additional rate @xmath10 between the states of the avoided crossing  @xcite .",
    "it can be exploited for a switching mechanism in driven quantum systems , e.g.  a weakly driven bistable system  @xcite . for the above occupation distributions for regular and chaotic states we demonstrate drastic consequences if a regular state has an avoided crossing with either a regular or a chaotic state .",

    "this behavior is explained by the additional rate @xmath10 and a simplified rate model , see below .",

    "the regular energies @xmath321 are not well defined for the hybridizing states of the avoided crossing , but are well defined for the respective diabatic states @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "that is why the occupations in these subfigures are represented in the diabatic basis by means of the orthogonal transformation @xmath322 and @xmath323 with @xmath324 and @xmath325 .",

    "[ fig : emean_rho_ereg_rho_ac2](b ) the rate model seems at first sight not applicable , since it does not account for chaotic states .",

    "this is possible , as the occupation of the regular state @xmath199 differs only weakly from the plateau of chaotic occupations .",
    "a core question of statistical mechanics is the characterization of the asymptotic state approached by a quantum system when it interacts with a thermal reservoir . in the familiar equilibrium thermodynamics of time - independent systems in the weak - coupling limit",
    "it is answered by the canonical distribution , where the eigenstates of the isolated quantum system are occupied with the statistical weights @xmath327 . in a time - periodic quantum system , where an external field permanently pumps energy into the system and prevents its relaxation to equilibrium , this is in general an intricate question , which can not be answered by deduction from the time - independent case .",
    "here , the asymptotic state under a weak coupling to the thermal reservoir becomes time - periodic and is best characterized by the time - independent occupations @xmath75 of the floquet states .",
    "we demonstrate , that the floquet occupations can be classified according to the semiclassical character of the floquet states .",
    "the occupations of the chaotic floquet states fluctuate weakly around a mean value @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "the regular floquet states on the contrary acquire probabilities that are roughly exponentially distributed .",
    "the validity of this observation is also confirmed by the occupation characteristics of other types of floquet states , which still reflects their regular or chaotic nature : beach states , which are very similar to the regular states and situated close , but outside the regular island , they form a correlated set of occupations , which is qualitatively comparable to the regular occupations . in contrast , the occupations of hierarchical states , which have the properties of chaotic states , but live in a restricted region of the chaotic phase space , are distributed analogously to the chaotic states .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of a driven particle in a box  @xcite , where the regular states carry occupations close to the boltzmann weights , we observe that in general the regular occupations can considerably deviate from the boltzmann result .",
    "this observation is possible as we focus on time - periodic systems where the classical phase space and the floquet states are strongly perturbed compared to the originally time - independent system . in kicked systems",
    "the occupations of the regular states can be well approximated by a function @xmath328 depending on the classical winding numbers @xmath124 of the regular tori , and the parameters temperature @xmath42 and driving frequency @xmath125 . for a constant or sufficiently moderately varying winding number within the regular island the distribution of the regular occupations",
    "can even be described by weights of the boltzmann type , @xmath329 , depending on the regular energies @xmath1 .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath2 is evaluated as a function of the winding number in the regular island . as the driven system is not in an equilibrium state ,",
    "the proper definition of a non - equilibrium temperature is a subtle problem  @xcite .",
    "the critical question for future investigations is , whether the quantity @xmath194 is accessible by a measurement .",
    "a situation , where purely classical information is no longer sufficient to account for the observed occupations , is present at avoided crossings , which are ubiquitous in the quasienergy spectra of floquet systems . avoided",
    "crossings involving a regular state give rise to strong changes in the set of floquet occupations .",
    "we give an intuitive explanation of this effect , based on the additional rate @xmath10 from ref .",
    "@xcite , and introduce a simplified rate model whose analytical solutions describe the numerical data accurately .    in conclusion , with the presented characterizations of the floquet occupations we demonstrate that ubiquitous signatures of the classical dynamics are reflected in the asymptotic density matrix of the open quantum system . in this way",
