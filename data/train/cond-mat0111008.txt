    "ever since the presentation by tsallis@xcite of a new possible generalization of the statistical mechanics ( tsallis statistics ) based on the nonextensive entropy , @xmath0 a large number of investigations has been developed concerning this subject @xcite .",
    "these investigations are basically employed in the discussion of aspects related to nonextensive phenomena , such as , lvy - type anomalous superdiffusion @xcite , euler turbulence@xcite , self - gravitating systems and related themes@xcite , cosmic background radiation @xcite , peculiar velocities in galaxies@xcite , eletron - phonon interaction@xcite , and ferrofluid - like systems@xcite .",
    "in addition , some important methods of the usual boltzmann - gibbs statistics have been generalized in order to incorporate the tsallis framework , _",
    "e. g. _ , linear response theory @xcite , green function theory@xcite and path integral@xcite .",
    "however , exact calculations are generally difficult to be performed in the context of tsallis statistics .",
    "motivated by these difficulties some approximated methods , such as @xmath1 expansion @xcite , factorization approximation @xcite , perturbative expansion @xcite , generalized bogoliubov inequality @xcite , and semi - classical expansion@xcite , have been developed .",
    "the two first methods mentioned above have been employed largely in the analysis of black body radiation @xcite and in other many independent particle systems @xcite , but without a careful analysis of the validity of these methods .",
    "thus , a detailed discussion of the @xmath1 expansion and the factorization approximation plays a special role in this scenario . in this direction ,",
    "@xcite contains a discussion comparing these approximations in the context of the quantum gases .",
    "however , some important aspects of the comparison are still lacking , in particular the importance of the degrees of freedom @xmath2 .",
    "this work is addressed to analyze how precise the @xmath1 expansion and the factorization approximation are by considering @xmath2 arbitrary . to perform this study",
    "it is convenient to consider a solvable model in order to carefully understand the degree of accuracy of these approximations .",
    "furthermore , the chosen model must contain important features of other more realistic ones .",
    "this is just the case of a set of harmonic oscillators . in this direction , to analyze the @xmath1 expansion and the factorization approximation , we focus our discussion on the classical tsallis statistics by considering @xmath2 one dimesional harmonic oscillators , _ i. e. _ , we employ the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian to the @xmath5-th harmonic oscillator , being @xmath6 the particle mass and @xmath7 the harmonic oscillator frequency .    this work is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "similar conclusions can be directly verified for the classical ideal gas , since the calculation details related to it are similar to that performed here for a set harmonic oscillators .",
    "we would like to stress that the system discussed here is usually employed as a first approximation in many contexts and consequently it has received a special attention in the studies based on the nonextensive tsallis statistics . in conclusion , the results presented here strongly suggest that @xmath1 expansion and factorization approximation are not good approximating methods when @xmath69 is generic and @xmath2 is very large ; thus , we should be very careful when employing these approximations .",
