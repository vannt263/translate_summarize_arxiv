    "cells in the nervous system are organized in complex interconnected networks , which feature a rich variety of electrical activity .",
    "there is abundant experimental evidence linking spatio - temporal features of the firing patterns generated by neuronal networks to various physiological and cognitive processes .",
    "therefore , elucidating dynamical principles underlying pattern - formation in neuronal networks is an important problem of mathematical physiology .",
    "square wave bursting , one of the most common firing patterns , is characterized by alternating periods of fast oscillations of the membrane potential and quiescence @xcite .",
    "typically , cells that generate bursting , under different conditions exhibit other firing patterns such as periodic or aperiodic spiking or reside in the excitable regime @xcite .",
    "transitions between different dynamical regimes in excitable cells often signal important physiological or cognitive events such as changes in the rate of hormone secretion or neurotransmitter release as in the cases of pancreatic @xmath0cells @xcite and midbrain dopamine neurons @xcite ; or changes in respiratory rhythm or attentional state as in the cases of neurons in the pre - botzinger complex @xcite or locus coeruleus @xcite respectively .",
    "not surprisingly , mathematical models have been used extensively to explain the origins of different firing patterns .",
    "for single cell models , mechanisms underlying various modes of electrical activity have been thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "some of the techniques developed for single cell models extend to cover small networks @xcite .",
    "however , mathematical analysis of large conductance - based networks without special assumptions on network topology is an outstanding problem .",
    "furthermore , there is a growing body of experimental and theoretical studies indicating the importance of noise in shaping neuronal dynamics @xcite . in the presence of noise in the network dynamics ,",
    "its analysis becomes even a more challenging problem .",
    "the goal of this paper is to elucidate principal factors shaping synchronous activity in large electrically coupled networks of bursting capable cells forced by small white noise .",
    "many ingredients contribute to the output of neuronal networks . among them , intrinsic properties of the individual cells ( local dynamics ) and the type and the structure of connections between cells ( network topology ) are probably the most important ones . direct electrical coupling through gap - junctions is a common way of communication between neurons as well as between cells of the heart , pancreas , and other physiological systems @xcite .",
    "the role of electrical coupling in shaping firing patterns generated by neuronal networks has been studied using many different techniques : the theory for weakly connected networks @xcite , poincare maps @xcite , and lyapunov functions @xcite , to name a few . in the present study",
    ", we consider a relatively less studied case of strong electrical coupling @xcite , for which we develop two complementary approaches based on center - manifold reduction @xcite and fast - slow decomposition @xcite .",
    "importantly , our method covers networks with arbitrary topology , which allows us to study a large class of models and to reveal the role of the network topology in shaping network dynamics .",
    "under fairly general conditions , strong electrical coupling synchronizes activity across the network @xcite .",
    "therefore , one might expect that dynamics of electrically coupled networks of bursting cells will closely resemble that of a single cell provided the coupling is strong enough .",
    "this is true in general for deterministic models .",
    "however , in the presence of noise network dynamics , while still synchronous , can be qualitatively different from that of a single cell uncoupled from its neighbors .",
    "for instance , single cell models , which exhibit irregular spiking in isolation ( fig .",
    "[ f.intro]a ) can generate very regular synchronous bursting when they are coupled electrically ( fig .",
    "[ f.intro]b ) . likewise , a coupled network exhibiting synchronous spiking for extremely long period of time ( fig .",
    "[ f.intro]c ) may be formed from bursting cells ( fig . [",
    "f.intro]d ) .",
    "the first scenario illustrated by fig .",
    "[ f.intro]a,b was proposed in @xcite to explain why pancreatic @xmath0cells burst within electrically coupled islets of langerhans , but in isolation exhibit irregular spiking .",
    "numerical experiments and formal analysis in @xcite show that noise shaping the dynamics of individual @xmath0cells becomes less effective when these cells are coupled electrically .",
    "it is certainly intuitive ( albeit not obvious mathematically ) that in a coupled network the effects of uncorrelated stochastic processes acting on individual cells may become weaker due to averaging .",
    "however , a remarkable property of electrical coupling , which as the analysis below shows should not be taken for granted , is that the variability of the coupled system can be fully controlled by varying two parameters : the coupling strength and the size of the network .",
    "we identify analytical conditions , which guarantee that the variability of the coupled systems ( the meaning of variability will be explained below ) goes to zero as the network size and the coupling strength tend to infinity .    *",
    "a * + * c *    besides bursting in electrically coupled islets of langerhans , other phenomena where denoising plays a central role , include episodes of phasic firing in the locus coeruleus network @xcite and enhanced reliability of neural responses in gap - junctionally coupled networks @xcite . in this paper , building on an earlier analysis of denoising in networks of integrate - and - fire neurons @xcite and our recent study of spontaneous activity in a closely related model of the locus coeruleus network @xcite , we derive quantitative estimates characterizing denoising in electrically coupled networks of conductance - based models .",
    "we find that the results obtained for integrate - and - fire models for individual cells do not extend automatically to conductance - based models with higher - dimensional state phase .",
    "we identify additional features of the local dynamics and coupling architecture that are needed to guarantee denoising .",
    "in particular , our analysis highlights the role of the bifurcation structure of the bursting cell model for denoising .",
    "it also elucidates the contribution of the network topology to this important effect .",
    "we show that networks on the graphs with large algebraic connectivity @xcite or small total effective resistance @xcite are better equipped for implementing denoising . as a by - product of the analysis of denoising",
    ", we analytically estimate the rate with which trajectories converge to the synchronization subspace and the stability of the latter to random perturbations .",
    "taken together , these results explain the mechanisms underlying synchronization and denoising in an important class of biological models .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we formulate our assumptions on the single cell model (  [ single - cell ] ) and explain how the network is formed (  [ coupled - network ] ) . in   [ graph],[examples ] , we collect necessary information from the algebraic graph theory @xcite , which will be used for describing the role of the network topology in dynamical phenomena analyzed in this paper . in section  [ transitions ] , we introduce two scenarios ( a and b ) leading to distinct firing patterns produced by the single cell models and by synchronized networks of these models . in the remainder of this section , we analyze the first of these scenarios illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f.intro ] ( a , b ) .",
    "first , in lemma  [ easy ] , we show that in the single cell model , bursting can be destroyed with small noise ( figure [ f.intro]a ) .",
    "this counter - intuitive result relies on the presence of a slow timescale in the dynamics of bursting .",
    "even very small noise can have significant qualitative effects on the dynamics of a slow - fast system , because during the ( long ) periods of slow evolution there is sufficient time for large deviations ( which are extremely unlikely on time intervals of order @xmath1 ) to develop .",
    "the proof of the lemma uses large deviation estimates and is adapted from @xcite .",
    "thus , given a deterministic model of a bursting cell , one can switch its dynamics into irregular spiking by adding noise .",
    "we then show that when many such cells are coupled together , the effects of noise weaken and the bursting of the underlying deterministic model reemerges ( figure [ f.intro]b ) .    the analysis of the coupled system proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , we use the center - manifold reduction @xcite to approximate the coupled system near an excitable equilibrium by a simpler lower - dimensional system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "second , thanks to the gradient structure of the reduced problem , we can accurately estimate expected time that a trajectory of the fast subsystem of the coupled system spends near the excitable equilibrium .",
    "we show that this time is much longer for the network model than for the single cell one .",
    "this analysis ( based on large deviation estimates @xcite ) yields one way of quantitative description of denoising .    in section  [ synchronization ]",
    ", we present a complementary method based on a slow - fast decomposition .",
    "we show that when the coupling is strong , network dynamics near the excitable equilibrium splits into two modes : fast synchronization and ultra - slow noise - driven escape from the basin of attraction of the equilibrium along a low - dimensional synchronization subspace .",
    "the results of this section yield valuable insights into synchronization properties of the coupled system .",
    "in particular , we estimate the rate of convergence of trajectories to the synchronization subspace and the stability of the latter against random perturbations .",
    "the estimates show explicitly the contribution of the structural properties of the network to stability properties of the synchronization subspace .    in section  [ denoising ] ,",
    "we take a look at denoising from a slightly different angle . specifically , we study the linearization of the coupled system near an excitable equilibrium directly without invoking center manifold reduction .",
    "the analysis shows that when the dynamics of the individual cells lives in multidimensional phase space ( unlike integrate - and - fire models or those of excitable cells near a saddle - node bifurcation ) , unless the coupling is full rank ( see @xcite for the definition of full versus partial rank coupling ) denoising should not be expected .",
    "these results show that the proximity to a saddle - node bifurcation in the fast subsystem of a square wave bursting neuron model , which makes the dynamics near the excitable equilibrium essentially one - dimensional , is critical for observing distinct dynamics generated by the single cell and network models .",
    "therefore , the bifurcation structure of the bursting cell models like those used in @xcite and in this paper is important for the interplay between electrical coupling and noise in shaping the dynamics of the coupled network .",
    "finally , the results of this study are summarized in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce a model that will be studied in the remainder of this paper .",
    "first , we formulate the assumptions on the single cell model and describe its main dynamical regimes .",
    "next , we introduce the coupled system . at the end of this section , we review some notions and facts from the algebraic graph theory @xcite , which will be useful for characterizing the contribution of the network topology to dynamics .    * a * + * d *      in numerical experiments throughout this paper , we are going to use a conductance based model of a pancreatic @xmath0cell due to chay @xcite .",
    "the analysis in the following sections does not depend on any specific details of this model and more general assumptions will be formulated below .",
    "however , we believe that it is instructive to start from a concrete model to make the biological interpretation of the analysis that follows transparent . with this in mind , following @xcite , we introduce the a system of differential equations modeling electrochemical dynamics in the @xmath0cells : @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for the cell membrane potential , gating variable , and the concentration of calcium respectively .",

    "having reviewed bursting in deterministic systems and the definition of the coupled network , we now turn to the main theme of this work - the roles of noise and electrical coupling in shaping firing patterns of the coupled system ( [ c.1 ] ) and ( [ c.2 ] ) .",

    "thus , we need to understand the behavior of @xmath262 for increasing values of @xmath179 . in the following lemma , we show that the latter depends on the coupling architecture and identify two cases of full and partial coupling , which are important in the context of denoising .",

    "+ @xmath132    in conclusion , we discuss the implications of the analysis of this section .",
    "there are two effects that contribute to denoising : averaging and synchronization .",
    "the former can be interpreted as a manifestation of the law of large numbers : the combined effect of independent stochastic processes acting on individual cells vanishes as the size of the network goes to infinity .",
    "it is captured by the first term on the right hand side of ( [ triangle1 ] ) . from ( [ triangle1 ] )",
    "it follows that averaging depends on the network size , @xmath12 , and the dissipativity of the local dynamics through @xmath285 but is independent from the properties of the coupling operator . the second term on the right hand side of ( [ triangle1 ] ) , which captures synchronization , depends on the dissipativity of the coupling operator through @xmath262 , the coupling strength @xmath179 , and the size of the network .",
    "denoising takes place when the variance of the trajectories of the coupled system can be controlled by @xmath12 and @xmath179 .",
    "in fact , we can always make the first term in ( [ triangle1 ] ) arbitrarily small by taking @xmath12 large enough .",
    "to control the second term on the right hand side of ( [ triangle1 ] ) , we can use @xmath179 provided @xmath286 .",
    "thus , one can make the right hand side of ( [ triangle1 ] ) arbitrarily small by increasing @xmath12 and @xmath179 provided @xmath262 is bounded away from @xmath275 as @xmath263 .",
    "lemma  [ perturb ] identifies two cases important in the context of denoising and synchronization .",
    "depending on the rank of @xmath234 , the leading eigenvalue of @xmath287 , @xmath262 , is either @xmath1 or @xmath288 for @xmath289 .",
    "if the coupling is full rank then @xmath290 and ( [ triangle1 ] ) shows that the variability of large coupled systems can be effectively controlled by the coupling strength and the network size .",
    "however , if the coupling is partial ( @xmath291 ) , as in the model of gap - junctionally coupled network ( [ net.1])-([net.3 ] ) , ( [ triangle1 ] ) becomes _ i x^(i ) ( 1n_1 ( a^s)+ n-1_1 ( g^s ) + o ( ) ) + o(^2n ) this shows that in the partial coupling case the mechanism of denoising may fail .",
    "our numerical experiments and the analysis of ( [ net.1])-([net.3 ] ) show that denoising is at work despite the fact that the coupling is partial in this model .",
    "we are able to observe denosing in ( [ net.1])-([net.3 ] ) because of the additional structure of this problem - the proximity of the models of individual cells to the saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "this additional feature of the problem affords center manifold reduction , and the coupling of the reduced system is already full rank .",
    "this reconciles the results of this section with the previous analysis and our numerical results .",
    "this also highlights the importance of the bifurcation structure of the fast subsystem of the bursting cell model ( [ ch.1])-([ch.3 ] ) for the mechanism of denoising .",
    "more generally , this discussion implies that while the mechanism of denoising can be already studied at the level of the linearized system , the structure of the nonlinear system is nonetheless important for the realization of denosing in concrete ( biophysical ) models .    * a * + * c * + * e *",
    "in this work , we have analyzed synchronous regimes in electrically coupled networks of bursting capable excitable cells .",
    "the individual cells in the network can be tuned to one of the three main activity states : periodic spiking , bursting , or quiescence .",
    "strong electrical coupling synchronizes activity across the network .",
    "however , in the presence of noise , the synchronous patterns generated by the network can differ qualitatively from the patterns that the cells comprising the network exhibit in isolation .",
    "we have identified two scenarios of such behavior : scenario a and scenario b. in the former , the network of irregularly spiking cells generates very regular bursting provided the coupling is sufficiently strong . in the latter ,",
    "the network formed from irregularly bursting cells is effectively switched to spiking once the coupling strength and the size of the network become sufficiently large .    in constructing these scenarios featuring the disparity of the firing patterns generated by the single cell and coupled models",
    ", we used the large deviations type mechanisms to generate irregular patterns in the single cell models and denoising for shaping the patterns of collective behavior in the network .",
    "in particular , for irregular spiking in scenario a , we used noise to perturb the system from slowly evolving stable equilibrium .",
    "a closely related mechanism was studied in the context of emerging regular dynamics in randomly perturbed slow - fast systems @xcite and self - induced stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "the irregular bursting in scenario b was organized by perturbing a system with a stable limit cycle via the mechanism proposed in @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the slow - fast structure of the single cell models was essential .",
    "the emerging firing patterns in both scenarios are very sensitive to the variations in the intensity of noise . utilizing the ability of electrical coupling to synchronize the activity and to reduce the effects of noise on network dynamics @xcite , for the coupled system we achieved effective control of the firing patterns by varying the strength of coupling and the size of the network .    in this paper , we analyzed in detail the mechanism of denoising for coupled systems with ( slowly evolving ) stable equilibria ( scenario a ) .",
    "we expect that the analysis of scenario b can be done along the same lines by combining the techniques of section  [ denoising ] and local analysis near the synchronous limit cycle of the coupled system as in @xcite .",
    "we will address this problem in the future work . for scenario a , we considered two cases : one - when the individual subsystems are close the saddle - node bifurcation as in the network of model bursting neurons ( [ c.1 ] ) and ( [ c.2 ] ) , our motivating example , and another without assuming the proximity to the saddle - node bifurcation . for systems near the bifurcation , we adapted two complementary approaches from @xcite .",
    "the former of which utilizes the gradient structure of the reduced system to yield accurate estimates of the first exit times from the basins of the stable equilibria of the single cell and coupled models ; while the latter relies on the algebraic graph theory techniques @xcite , which elucidate the contribution of the network topology to synchronization and denoising .",
    "furthermore , we extended the analysis of denoising in systems of coupled integrate and fire models in @xcite to conductance based models with multidimensional phase spaces .",
    "we have shown that in this setting the coupling architecture is very important for implementing denoising .",
    "in particular , for the common in applications partial coupling case , we have shown that denosing generically does not take place , in contrast to what one might expect from the analysis of the coupled one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "this result highlights the significance of the bifurcation structure of the biophysical models of square wave bursting neurons for the realization of denoising .",
    "the proximity to the saddle node bifurcation makes the dynamics of the individual subsystems effectively one - dimensional and the coupling effectively - full rank , thus circumventing the problems for implementing denosing in partially coupled systems identified in section  [ denoising ] .",
    "therefore , the results of this study extend and complement the existing results characterizing denoising in electrically coupled networks @xcite and highlight the importance of the bifurcation structure of the local dynamical systems comprising the network for implementing denoising .    in analyzing the coupled system , we paid special attention to the role of the network topology in shaping the network dynamics . we have found that two spectral functions : the algebraic connectivity and the total effective resistance , feature prominently in the quantitative descriptions of synchronization and denoising in electrically coupled networks .",
    "the algebraic connectivity of the weighted graph of the network sets the rate of convergence to the synchronization subspace ( cf .",
    "( [ rate - sync ] ) ) , while the total effective resistance is involved in the estimates of stochastic stability of the synchronous regime ( cf .",
    "( [ lim - var ] ) ) .",
    "these analytical estimates allow one to use many known results relating the spectra of the graphs and their structural properties ( see @xcite and references therein ) to elucidate the contribution of the network structure to its dynamics . as an example of such application",
    ", we used the spectral properties of random graphs @xcite to show that networks on random graphs feature fast synchronization and robustness of synchrony to noise .",
