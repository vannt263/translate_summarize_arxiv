    "the spectral excess theorem , due to fiol and garriga @xcite , states that a regular ( connected ) graph @xmath0 is distance - regular if and only if its spectral - excess ( a number which can be computed from the spectrum of @xmath0 ) equals its average excess ( the mean of the numbers of vertices at maximum distance from every vertex ) , see van dam @xcite , and fiol , gago and garriga @xcite for short proofs .",
    "recently , some local as well as global approaches to that result have been used to obtain new versions of the theorem for nonregular graphs , and also to study the problem of characterizing those graphs which have the corresponding distance - regularity property ( see , for instance , dalf , van dam , fiol , garriga , and gorissen @xcite ) .",
    "one of these concepts is that of ` pseudo - distance - regularity ' around a vertex , introduced by fiol , garriga , and yebra @xcite , which generalizes the known concept of distance - regularity around a vertex and , in some cases , coincides with that of distance - biregularity , intended for bipartite graphs .",
    "a bipartite graph is distance - biregular when it is distance - regular around each vertex and the intersection array only depends on the stable set such a vertex belongs to ( see delorme @xcite ) . in general",
    ", distance - regular and distance - biregular graphs have found many ` applications ' .",
    "some examples are completely regular codes , symmetric designs , some partial geometries , and some non - symmetric association schemes .    in this note",
    "we present a new version of the spectral excess theorem for bipartite distance - biregular graphs .",
    "let us first introduce some basic notation and results . for more background on graph spectra and different concepts of distance - regularity in graphs see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a ( connected ) graph with @xmath2 vertices and diameter @xmath3 .",
    "the set of vertices at distance @xmath4 from a given vertex @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 for @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    if @xmath0 has adjacency matrix @xmath11 , its spectrum is denoted by @xmath12 where the different eigenvalues of @xmath0 are in decreasing order , @xmath13 , and the superscripts stand for their multiplicities @xmath14 . from the positive ( @xmath15-)eigenvector @xmath16 normalized in such a way that @xmath17 , consider the _ weight function _",
    "@xmath18 such that @xmath19 for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for the coordinate @xmath22-th vector , and @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 assigns the number @xmath26 to vertex @xmath22 , and @xmath27 .      in our study",
    "we use some properties of orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable ( see cmara , fbrega , fiol and garriga @xcite ) . from a mesh @xmath28 , @xmath29 , of real numbers , and a weight function @xmath30 , normalized in such a way that @xmath31 , we consider the following scalar product in @xmath32 $ ] : @xmath33 where , for short , @xmath34 , @xmath35 . then , the sequence @xmath36 of orthogonal polynomials with respect to such a scalar product , with @xmath37 , normalized in such a way that @xmath38 , and their sum polynomials @xmath39 , @xmath40 , satisfy the following properties :    [ ortho - pol ]    * @xmath41 and the constants of the three term recurrence @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , satisfy @xmath44 for @xmath35 . * @xmath45 , were @xmath46 , @xmath35 .",
    "* @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for every @xmath49 .    as the notation suggests , in our context the mesh @xmath50 is constituted by the eigenvalues of a graph @xmath0 , and the weight function is closely related to their ( standard or local ) multiplicities .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath51 we have the scalar product @xmath52 and the sequence @xmath53 are called the _",
    "predistance polynomials_. in this case , we denote them by @xmath54 , and their sums by @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , it is known that the _ hoffman polynomial _",
    "@xmath56 , characterized by @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath49 , satisfies @xmath59 if and only if @xmath0 is regular ( see hoffman @xcite ) .",
    "a ` local version ' of the above approach is the following .",
    "let @xmath60 , @xmath61 , be the ( principal ) idempotent of @xmath0 .",
    "then , for a given vertex @xmath22 , the _ @xmath22-local multiplicity of @xmath62 _ is defined as @xmath63 . as was shown by fiol , garriga and yebra @xcite , the local multiplicities",
    "behave similarly as the ( standard ) multiplicities when we ` see ' the graph from the base vertex @xmath22 .",
    "indeed ,    * @xmath64 ( vs. @xmath65 ) . * @xmath66 . * @xmath67 ( vs. @xmath68 ) .    then , given a vertex @xmath22 with @xmath69 different local eigenvalues ( that is , those with nonzero local multiplicity ) , the choice @xmath70 , @xmath35 , leads us to the scalar product @xmath71 ( note that the sum has at most @xmath72 nonzero terms . )",
    "then , the corresponding orthogonal sequence @xmath73 is referred to as the _ @xmath22-local predistance polynomials _ , and they are denoted by @xmath74 . notice that , by the above property of the local multiplicities , @xmath75      let @xmath0 be a bipartite graph on @xmath76 vertices , with stables sets @xmath77 and @xmath78 , on @xmath79 and @xmath80 vertices , respectively .",
    "let @xmath0 have diameter @xmath3 , and let @xmath81 denote the maximum eccentricity of the vertices in @xmath82 , @xmath83 , so that @xmath84 . as it is well known , @xmath85 and , without loss of generality",
    ", we here suppose that @xmath86 .",
    "given some integers @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we will use the averages @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "recall also that the spectrum of a bipartite graph is symmetric about zero : @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath61 .",
    "moreover its local eigenvalues and multiplicities also share the same property . in our context",
    ", we also have the following result .    [ loc - mul - bip ]",
    "let @xmath93 be a bipartite graph with vertex bipartition @xmath94 . then",
    ", the local multiplicities satisfy :    * @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "* @xmath97 , * @xmath98 .    by counting in two ways the number of closed @xmath99-walks rooted at a vertex we have that @xmath100 .",
    "then , @xmath101 and , hence , @xmath102 and @xmath103 follows since @xmath104 .",
    "to prove @xmath105 , we use that @xmath106 and @xmath103 .",
    "then , @xmath107 similarly for @xmath108 .",
    "this result suggests to define the scalar products @xmath109 and @xmath110 , by taking the weights @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath40 , respectively . in this case ,",
    "notice that @xmath113 then , by lema [ loc - mul - bip ] , @xmath114 and similarly for @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding sequences of orthogonal polynomials and their sums are denoted by @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "there are four cases to be considered :    * if @xmath117 , then @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , with @xmath120 being the predistance polynomial for @xmath35 . *",
    "if @xmath121 is odd , then @xmath122 is not an eigenvalue of @xmath0 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "then , from the normalization conditions , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , @xmath35 . * if @xmath121 is even and @xmath127 , then @xmath128 , and the expressions for @xmath109 , in , and @xmath110 have @xmath129 terms . * if @xmath121 is even and @xmath130 , say @xmath131 , then @xmath132 but @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the scalar product @xmath110 is defined on the mesh of the @xmath121 nonzero eigenvalues and , in this case , we denote the corresponding sequence of orthogonal polynomials by @xmath134 .",
    "a bipartite graph @xmath0 with stable sets @xmath135 is _ distance - biregular _ when it is distance - regular around each vertex @xmath22 and the intersection array only depends on the stable set @xmath22 belongs to . for some properties of these graphs , see delorme @xcite .",
    "an example is the subdivided petersen graph @xmath136 , obtained from such a graph by inserting a vertex into each of its edges , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bibipetersen ] .        in particular ,",
    "every distance - biregular graph @xmath0 is _ semiregular _ , that is , all vertices in the same independent set have the same degree .",
    "if vertices in @xmath82 have degree @xmath137 , @xmath83 , we say that @xmath0 is _ @xmath138-semiregular_. in this case , the normalized positive eigenvector of @xmath0 is @xmath139 , where @xmath140    a more general framework for studying distance - biregular graphs , which we use here , is that of pseudo - distance - regularity , a concept introduced by fiol , garriga , and yebra in @xcite .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is said to be _ pseudo - distance - regular around a vertex _",
    "@xmath5 with eccentricity @xmath141 if the numbers , defined for any vertex @xmath142 , @xmath143 depend only on the value of @xmath144 . in this case , we denote them by @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , respectively , and they are referred to as the _ @xmath22-local pseudo - intersection numbers _ of @xmath0 . in the main result of this paper we use the following theorems of fiol and garriga @xcite .",
    "the first one can be considered as the spectral excess theorem for pseudo - distance - regular graphs :    [ teo caract c - c - r ] let @xmath22 be a vertex of a graph @xmath0 , with @xmath69 distinct local eigenvalues , and sum of predistance polynomials @xmath148 .",
    "then , for any polynomial @xmath149 $ ] with @xmath150 , @xmath151 and equality holds if and only if @xmath152 for any @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , equality holds with @xmath154 if and only @xmath22 has maximum eccentricity @xmath155 and @xmath0 is pseudo - distance - regular around @xmath22 .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is said to be _ pseudo - distance - regularized _ when it is pseudo - distance - regular graph around each of its vertices .",
    "generalizing a result of godsil and shawe - taylor @xcite , the author proved the following :          [ teo caract dist - bireg ] let @xmath0 be a bipartite @xmath138-regular on @xmath156 vertices , and with @xmath129 distinct eigenvalues .",
    "let @xmath0 have average numbers @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and highest degree polynomials @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 defined as above .",
    "then , @xmath0 is distance - biregular if and only if some of the following conditions holds :        @xmath103 if @xmath117 , then @xmath0 is regular and the result is just the spectral excess theorem for distance - regular graphs . if @xmath121 is odd we are in case @xmath170 discussed above , and @xmath162 and @xmath163 are multiples of the predistance polynomial @xmath171 . then , reasoning as in the proof of case @xmath172 ,",
    "see below , we have that @xmath0 is distance - biregular if and only if @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "but , as @xmath121 is odd , by counting in two ways the number of pairs of vertices at distance @xmath121 , we have that @xmath175 .",
    "then , putting all together , we get that @xmath176 , and @xmath0 must be again regular .    to prove @xmath172",
    ", we first claim that , with @xmath177 , the inequality can be written as @xmath178 indeed , if @xmath179 the result is obvious , whereas if @xmath180 , then @xmath181 $ ] . here",
    "equality must be understood in the quotient ring @xmath182/i$ ] , where @xmath183 is the ideal generated by the polynomial with zeros the @xmath69 eigenvalues having non - null @xmath22-local multiplicity .",
    "thus , @xmath184 , where @xmath185 , and the inequality in still holds .",
    "now , by taking the average over all vertices of @xmath77 , we have @xmath186 where we used ( [ average - scal - prod ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath187 where we used that , as @xmath121 is even , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 stands for the harmonic mean of the numbers @xmath190 .",
    "furthermore , since the harmonic mean is at most the arithmetic mean , @xmath191 this , together with @xmath192 ( recall that in the scalar product @xmath193 we have @xmath194 ) , gives @xmath195 then , in case of equality all inequalities in must be also equalities and , from theorem  [ teo caract c - c - r ] , @xmath0 is pseudo - distance - regular around each vertex @xmath196 . in the same way , we prove that , if @xmath197 , then @xmath0 is pseudo - distance - regular around each vertex @xmath198 .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 is a pseudo - distance - regularized graph and , by theorem  [ pdrg = drg ] , it is also distance - biregular .",
    "* notice that , in cases @xmath103 and @xmath172 the diameters of @xmath0 turn to be @xmath201 , whereas in case @xmath199 we have @xmath202 and @xmath203 . as an example of the latter we have again the subdivided petersen graph of fig .",
