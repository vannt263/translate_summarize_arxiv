    "azimuthal anisotropies of hadron spectra are a good measure of collective behavior of the dense particle system formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the origin of such anisotropies is thought to be the rescattering among the particles , which are initially produced in isotropic partonic interactions .",
    "these anisotropies can be quantified by the second fourier coefficient @xmath2 , the so called elliptic flow coefficient , of the azimuthal hadron distribution . in non - central au + au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl",
    "the observed quite large @xmath2 is regarded as one of the strongest signals pointing towards the formation of thermalized strongly interacting partonic matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "a common way to interpret the measured elliptic flow data is through full equilibrium , perfect - fluid hydrodynamical models , see e.g. reviews @xcite , with the cooper - frye freeze - out mechanism @xcite .",
    "consistency between these type of models and the measured data at rhic is regarded as evidence for low viscosity @xcite and fast thermalization @xcite of the qgp . however",
    ", a complete description of the low-@xmath1 spectra and elliptic flow coefficients of pions simultaneously with e.g. those of protons is problematic in this simple approach .    to improve the modeling ,",
    "several different approaches have been developed . if the chemical freeze - out is taken to happen before the complete kinetic freeze - out in the cooper - frye type of decoupling @xcite , a good simultaneous description of e.g. the transverse momentum spectra of pions and protons can be obtained @xcite .",
    "however , elliptic flow tends to be overestimated in these models . at the moment ,",
    "perhaps the best agreement with the data is obtained from the hybrid models , which combine hydrodynamical treatment of the qgp and hadron cascade simulation of the hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a proper understanding of hadronic interactions and the freeze - out mechanism are important in interpreting the observed data at rhic .",
    "also hydrodynamical codes with shear viscosity corrections have been recently developed for non - central collisions @xcite .",
    "these calculations indicate also low values of viscosity in the expanding matter .",
    "the key input to the hydrodynamical models are the initial state and the equation of state ( eos ) of the qcd matter .",
    "when the initial state is obtained by fitting the hydrodynamical model to the rhic data , the observed total hadron multiplicities fix the initial total entropy very well , but the transverse profiles of the initial densities are not as well constrained , see e.g. ref .  @xcite .",
    "one possibility for controlling this uncertainty is to use theoretically predicted initial conditions . in this approach",
    "it is possible to predict the initial state for different collision energies and nuclei as well .",
    "this has been our strategy e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in @xcite we used the initial state from the ekrt final state saturation model @xcite and showed that the perturbative qcd + saturation + hydrodynamics approach gives a good description of the @xmath1 spectra of pions and kaons , and hadronic multiplicities in central au + au collisions at rhic .",
    "we also presented the predictions for the hadron @xmath1 spectra in central pb + pb collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "we have also shown predictions for the elliptic flow at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to expand our previous studies of the hadron spectra and elliptic flow at the lhc and to probe the uncertainties in the predictions .",
    "a similar approach with a calculated initial state is used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the initial state is obtained from the color - glass condensate model @xcite .",
    "other lhc predictions for the elliptic flow using the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and in the framework of viscous hydrodynamics in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this study",
    "we adopt the simple approach and use the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics for the space - time evolution of the matter , assuming full kinetic and chemical equilibrium throughout the evolution , see sec .",
    "ii . in spite of its restrictions discussed above ,",
    "the full - equilibrium hydrodynamical approach , once tested against the rhic data , provides a good framework for baseline predictions of the low-@xmath1 pion spectra and elliptic flow coefficients at the lhc . as discussed in sec .",
    "iii below , the ekrt model gives us the initial state for the hydrodynamical evolution in central @xmath0 collisions for both rhic and the lhc energies .",
    "extension to non - central collisions is made by using the optical glauber model at two different limits .",
    "the hydrodynamical evolution , elliptic flow , eccentricities and transverse flow at rhic and lhc are discussed in sec .",
    "we will first , in sec .",
    "v , show that the model results agree with the rhic data , and then in sec .  vi present our predictions for the transverse momentum spectra of pions and for the elliptic flow coefficients of pions and protons at the lhc .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "once the initial energy density @xmath3 and the net - baryon density @xmath4 are given and the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath5 is known , the evolution of matter can be described by relativistic hydrodynamics . by solving the perfect - fluid hydrodynamic equations , i.e. the local conservation of 4-momentum , @xmath6 , and of net - baryon number , @xmath7 , one obtains the space - time evolution of all thermodynamic quantities and the collective flow velocity @xmath8 of the matter . when considering particle production at midrapidities , where the rapidity spectra are approximately flat , these equations can be simplified by assuming longitudinal boost invariance .",
    "in this case the longitudinal flow velocity is given by @xmath9 @xcite , and all hydrodynamical quantities become independent of the space - time rapidity @xmath10 $ ] , i.e. they depend on the transverse coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the longitudinal proper time @xmath13 only .",
    "this reduces the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional problem to a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional one .",
    "we write then the conservation laws in these variables and , including the eos , solve them numerically by applying the shasta algorithm @xcite .    in constructing the eos @xcite , we describe the high - temperature phase as an ideal gas of massless quarks and gluons with number of flavors @xmath14 and a bag constant @xmath15 , while the low - temperature phase is taken as an ideal gas of all hadronic states with @xmath16 gev @xcite .",
    "the qgp and hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) phases are connected via the maxwell construction with mixed phase ( mp ) between the qgp and the hrg phase .",
    "the order of the phase transition has been shown to have only small effects on the hadron @xmath1 spectra and the elliptic flow of pions @xcite .",
    "as in our earlier studies @xcite , @xmath15 is chosen such that the phase transition temperature is @xmath17 mev .",
    "we assume full kinetic and chemical equilibrium for both phases throughout the temperature range considered in this work .",
    "final hadron spectra are calculated through the cooper - frye decoupling procedure @xcite as particle emission from a constant-@xmath18 surface obtained from the hydrodynamic calculation .",
    "we determine the decoupling temperature @xmath19  a parameter which controls the @xmath1 slopes of the hadron spectra in the single-@xmath19 hydrodynamic framework  from the rhic data , as described in refs .",
    "@xcite . for a recent discussion of the relation of @xmath19 and decoupling dynamics ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "after the cooper - frye decoupling , all 2- and 3-body strong and electromagnetic decays of unstable hadronic states are accounted for .",
    "thus , the feed - down from weak decays is not included in this work .",
    "as initial conditions , the boost - invariant hydrodynamic calculation , at an impact parameter @xmath20 , requires the densities @xmath21 , @xmath22 at an initial time @xmath23 .",
    "our reference baseline is central collisions , for which we obtain the initial densities from the ekrt minijet ( final state ) saturation model @xcite .",
    "in addition to the primary partonic transverse energy and the net - baryon number produced at midrapidity in central aa collisions , the ekrt model also gives the average formation time in terms of the saturation momentum , @xmath24 .",
    "assuming immediate thermalization at production , @xmath25 , using the binary collision ( bc ) profiles for the transverse - coordinate dependence of the densities , and setting @xmath26  mev , we have previously shown that the minijet + saturation + hydrodynamics model is in good agreement with the rhic data in most central au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "we have also demonstrated that using the wounded nucleon ( wn ) profiles and @xmath27  mev leads to practically equally good results @xcite .",
    "also predictions for the central pb+pb collisions at the lhc have been presented @xcite .",
    "the determination of the transverse profiles for @xmath3 and @xmath4 is , however , problematic for the following reasons : first , the simplest version of the ekrt model for head - on collisions has only one saturation momentum scale , @xmath28 , which is perturbative , @xmath29  gev for large nuclei at rhic and lhc . in the localized version",
    "@xcite @xmath28 depends on the transverse location but near the edges of the system , where the produced matter density becomes low enough , @xmath28 becomes non - perturbative and the minijet calculation unreliable .",
    "second , non - central collisions can be expected to constitute a multiscale problem as very different nuclear regions are colliding with each other , and we can not expect the simple ekrt model to describe the more peripheral collisions very well .",
    "third , as discussed in @xcite , different regions in the transverse plane obviously form at different times ; the center with a larger saturation scale forms earlier than the edges of the system .",
    "this phenomenon adds the complication of needing to provide the initial conditions on a surface @xmath30 instead of just at a fixed initial time @xmath31 ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it is then obvious that some additional modeling is necessary in fixing the initial transverse profiles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for non - central collisions in particular .",
    "one possibility is to assume a mixture of the bc and wn profiles , either for the energy density or the entropy density @xcite , with the mixture coefficient determined from rhic data .",
    "then , however , since the initial transverse profiles should be affected by production dynamics as discussed in @xcite , an uncertainty in the extrapolation to the lhc energies would remain anyway since the mixture coefficients can change from rhic to the lhc .    instead of introducing further model details and thus also further model uncertainties regarding the transverse profiles and their @xmath32 dependence , we choose a simpler and more transparent approach",
    ": we fix the initial time @xmath23 to the value computed from the ekrt model in central collisions , and we compute the spectra and elliptic flow coefficients with the bc and wn initializations separately , considering these as two limiting cases of transverse profiles both at rhic and at the lhc",

    "the @xmath48 coefficients , which we compute from the hydrodynamic spectra , do not depend on rapidity , thus @xmath53 is implicit .",
    "our definition of the minimum bias elliptic flow coefficient , @xmath54 , in turn is as follows , @xmath55 in the calculations the impact parameter is in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "therefore , the system is initially shorter and the pressure gradients stronger in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "stronger pressure gradients will generate stronger transverse flow during the evolution in the short direction . as a result the system grows faster in the @xmath11 direction than in the @xmath12 direction .",

    "these quantities are introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where also their behavior for different systems has been discussed .",
    "the spatial eccentricity is defined as @xmath61 where the integral is over the transverse plane and the energy density @xmath3 is used as the weighting factor .",
    "similarly , the momentum space eccentricity is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the components of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the average transverse flow can be defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and the @xmath66 factor has been used as an additional weight .    the spatial eccentricity @xmath67 measures the asymmetry of the matter distribution in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , thus it also measures the asymmetry of pressure gradients . in a noncentral heavy ion collision , with the impact parameter along the @xmath11-axis , the initial distribution of the matter corresponds to a positive initial @xmath67 which acts as a driving force to an asymmetric transverse flow .",
    "the generated flow asymmetry is quantified by @xmath68 .",
    "the sign convention of @xmath67 and @xmath68 is such that an initially positive @xmath67 leads to a positive @xmath68 .",
    "a positive @xmath68 at the end of the evolution will convert to a positive elliptic flow coefficient @xmath2 , which can be extracted from hadron spectra .",
    "the value of @xmath68 , when the system decouples , is approximately twice the @xmath1-integrated @xmath2 for pions @xcite , see figs . 3 and 5 .",
    "during the evolution the established asymmetric flow field tends to drive @xmath67 towards zero , i.e. towards azimuthally symmetric matter distribution .",
    "therefore the driving force for the growth of elliptic flow is strongest during the early stages of the collision . at later times",

    "initially @xmath67 is very similar for rhic and the lhc if the same initialization profiles ( ewn or ebc ) are used . at the beginning of the evolution ,",
    "when most of the matter is in the qgp phase , the flow generated by the pressure gradients starts to decrease @xmath67 . simultaneously @xmath68 is increasing .",
    "the initial rates of change for @xmath67 and @xmath68 are very similar at rhic and the lhc . during the qgp phase there is no significant difference in the behavior of @xmath67 and @xmath68 between the two collision energies , but much bigger difference between the two chosen initial profiles .",
    "when the system enters the mixed phase all pressure gradients vanish ceasing the increase of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath68 saturates even before @xmath67 goes to zero . during the mixed phase the matter is not accelerating , but the established flow field still expands the system transversally .",
    "this will cause @xmath68 actually to decrease during the mixed phase .",
    "the transition times between the different phases for different initializations can be read off from figs . 1 and 2 . these times",
    "coincide with the structures seen in the behavior of @xmath68 , and @xmath70 .",
    "transitions between the phases happen at different times at different transverse locations , therefore e.g. @xmath69 never completely saturates when most of the matter is in the mixed phase : part of the matter is always either in the hrg or in qgp phase , where the pressure gradients do not vanish .",
    "a significant difference between the lhc and rhic is the lifetime of the qgp phase . at the lhc",
    "@xmath68 has more time to grow before the system enters the mixed phase , which leads to a larger @xmath68 at the end of the evolution .",
    "therefore we also expect that the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath2 will be larger at the lhc than at rhic .",
    "longer lifetime of the qgp phase reflects also in the behavior of @xmath67 and @xmath69 . at rhic",
    "@xmath68 saturates well before @xmath67 goes to zero , and @xmath67 is still positive when the system enters the hrg phase and @xmath68 is slightly increasing . therefore there could still be some elliptic flow generated during the hrg phase at rhic , i.e. @xmath2 would have some sensitivity on the decoupling condition .",
    "this can be verified by an explicit calculation and within our framework @xmath2 increases by @xmath71% at @xmath72 when the decoupling temperature is changed from @xmath73 mev to @xmath74 mev . on the other hand at the lhc",
    "the saturation of @xmath68 and the sign change of @xmath67 happen more or less simultaneously and when the system enters the hrg phase @xmath67 is already negative and @xmath68 is slightly decreasing . at the lhc @xmath2 is slightly decreasing when @xmath19 is decreasing but the hrg effects are significantly smaller at the lhc than at rhic .",
    "thus the predictions for the @xmath1-integrated @xmath2 for the lhc are insensitive to the details of the hrg dynamics and therefore quite robust once the initial profile is fixed .",
    "in contrast to the behavior of @xmath68 , @xmath69 never completely saturates . even at late stages of the collision @xmath69 can still increase significantly .",
    "although the azimuthal asymmetry of the pressure gradients almost vanishes , the pressure gradient in the radial direction does not vanish .",
    "even though the gradient is small in the hrg phase , additional transverse velocity is generated and can be easily seen in the slopes of hadron @xmath1 spectra .",
    "thus the @xmath1 spectra of hadrons remain sensitive to the decoupling temperature and hrg dynamics both at rhic and the lhc . during the qgp",
    "phase the pressure gradients are strongest and the longer lifetime of the qgp phase at the lhc leads to a clearly larger transverse flow before the mixed phase than at rhic . regardless of the decoupling condition the @xmath1 spectra at the lhc are always flatter than at rhic .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath1-integrated @xmath2 for different initializations can be quite easily determined from the behavior of @xmath68 alone .",
    "the differential elliptic flow coefficient @xmath75 however depends not only on @xmath68 , but also on the slopes of the hadron @xmath1 spectra , which in turn depend on @xmath69 and temperature .",
    "in general , increasing @xmath68 will increase @xmath75 at fixed @xmath1 but increasing @xmath76 will decrease it @xcite .",
    "the net effect depends on the details of the hrg dynamics . within our framework with full chemical and kinetic equilibrium in the hrg throughout the evolution , the net result is that @xmath75 is quite insensitive to the decoupling temperature . at rhic",
    "@xmath75 is slightly increasing and at the lhc slightly decreasing with decreasing @xmath19 .",
    "these changes are , however , small and practically within our framework , predictions for @xmath75 are independent of the decoupling temperature .",
    "changes in the hrg dynamics would change this behavior , e.g. chemical freeze - out before kinetic freeze - out @xcite would modify the dependence of spectral slopes on temperature and flow conditions and thus would affect the behavior of @xmath75 as a function of the decoupling condition .",

    ", it also causes the lifetime of the qgp phase to drop faster . for very peripheral collisions",
    "the lifetime of the ebc system is considerably shorter than that of the ewn system .",

    "the ewn results for the lhc are very close to the @xmath75 values at rhic .",
    "this does not contradict the results for the @xmath1-integrated @xmath2 , which are obtained by weighting with the particle s @xmath1 spectra .",
    "since the spectra at the lhc are much flatter than at rhic ( , i.e .",
    "the average @xmath1 is larger at the lhc ) , @xmath2 gets more weight from the high @xmath1 region at the lhc . thus ,",
    "even if the @xmath75 curves coincide , the @xmath1-integrated @xmath2 will be larger at the lhc .",
    "the difference in @xmath75 between the rhic and the lhc results is that at the lhc the differential @xmath2 is more sensitive to the initial profile than at rhic , i.e. the ebc initialization leads to clearly larger values of @xmath75 than the ewn initialization , while at rhic both initializations give very similar results .",
    "the reason for this is the larger overall multiplicity and thus longer lifetime of the qgp phase at the lhc . even in more peripheral collisions",
    "the lifetime of the qgp phase is still long enough to generate enough elliptic flow such that the ordering of @xmath75 between the ebc and ewn initialization remains down to @xmath92 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "5 .     of protons for @xmath59  gev au + au collisions at rhic ( thin lines ) and @xmath60  gev pb + pb collisions at the lhc ( thick lines ) vs. @xmath1 .",
    "the rhic data are from the star @xcite and phenix @xcite collaborations.,height=340 ]    although our simple single-@xmath19 freeze - out model can not reproduce in detail the measured proton @xmath1-spectra and @xmath2 at rhic , it is still interesting to compare the general features in the calculated results for rhic and the lhc . figure 8 shows the results from the same calculation as for fig .  6 , but now for protons . also the rhic data from star @xcite and phenix @xcite collaborations are shown .",
    "when the calculations are compared with each other , for both the ebc and ewn initial profiles it is seen that the proton @xmath75 at fixed @xmath1 at the lhc is always _ below _ the rhic values .",
    "this can be understood as a mass effect @xcite . for the pions ,",
    "the increase in average @xmath1 compensates the increase in the flow asymmetry .",
    "however , for protons the increase of average @xmath1 is larger due to the larger mass of the proton .",
    "thus the increase of @xmath93 overcompensates the increase in the flow asymmetry .",
    "although we can not make a quantitative prediction of @xmath75 for the protons , we can infer from the results and arguments above that @xmath75 at the lhc is expected to be below the values measured at rhic , while , as in the case of pions , the @xmath1-integrated @xmath2 is still expected to be larger at the lhc than at rhic .    finally , we study the uncertainty from multiplicity in predicting the behavior of elliptic flow coefficients from rhic to the lhc . motivated by the multiplicity predictions in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have repeated the calculation for the lhc with half the multiplicity predicted by the ekrt model , by adjusting @xmath94_{b=0 } & \\rightarrow & \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left[de / d\\eta\\right]_{b=0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as suggested by the saturation conjecture @xcite .",
    "figure 9 shows the integrated @xmath2 for the two different multiplicities at the lhc together with results for rhic and fig .",
    "10 the minimum bias @xmath75 . with the lower multiplicity the lifetime of the qgp phase decreases and",
    "less elliptic flow is generated , which is clearly seen in fig .",
    "9 , where the integrated @xmath2 drops halfway between the rhic results and the original lhc prediction .",
    "the drop is similar between the ebc and ewn initializations .",
    "if a low multiplicity is observed at the lhc , the prediction with the ewn profile for @xmath2 extends down to similar values as observed at rhic .",
    "the integrated @xmath2 is clearly sensitive to the observed multiplicity . the minimum bias @xmath75 , shown in fig .",
    "10 is not as sensitive to the multiplicity as the integrated elliptic flow , but there is still a visible difference as compared with the high - multiplicity prediction .",
    "already for the high multiplicity calculation with the ewn profile , the lhc prediction is very close to the rhic data and our calculations for rhic .",
    "when the lhc multiplicity is lowered the ewn result drops at low @xmath1 even slightly below the rhic calculations and data .",
    "also the ebc prediction drops at low @xmath1 closer to the rhic results .",
    "for the lhc low - multiplicity calculation , height=340 ]     for the lhc low - multiplicity calculation , height=340 ]",
    "we study elliptic flow in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies using the framework of perfect - fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "the initial state for central heavy ion collisions is calculated from the pqcd + saturation model @xcite and perfect - fluid hydrodynamics is used to model the space - time evolution of the initially formed matter .",
    "centrality dependence is modeled by the optical glauber model .",
    "we have shown that the results from this approach are in reasonably good agreement with the measured data at rhic , and thus provide a good basis to predict both the pion spectra and elliptic flow coefficients in @xmath89 tev pb + pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "the main uncertainty in our model is the initial transverse profile of the energy density .",
    "this uncertainty is addressed by considering two limits of the glauber model , taking the energy density proportional either to the density of binary collisions or wounded nucleons .",
    "three main observations are made for the lhc .",
    "first we note that the @xmath1-integrated @xmath2 is expected to be much larger at the lhc than at rhic , since the lifetime of the qgp phase will be longer and thus the pressure gradients that generate elliptic flow will persist longer .",
    "the second observation is that @xmath75 for pions will be unchanged or may increase slightly from the values measured at rhic .",
    "this can be understood as an interplay between the flow asymmetry and flow magnitude @xcite . as the third point",
    "we observe that for heavier particles like protons , @xmath75 will be below the values measured at rhic , even if the @xmath1-integrated @xmath2 is larger .",
    "this is due to the fact that the increased flow velocity is more important for protons , and thus it overcompensates the increased flow asymmetry .",
    "we further noted that the @xmath1 integrated @xmath2 has still some sensitivity to the decoupling condition and therefore to the hrg dynamics at rhic , i.e. that spatial eccentricity is not entirely converted to the momentum space eccentricity before the matter enters the hrg phase . on the contrary ,",
    "the prediction of @xmath2 at the lhc is more robust than at rhic , once the initial profile and multiplicity are fixed : we do not expect the hrg dynamics to affect significantly the integrated @xmath2 at the lhc .",
    "the differential elliptic flow coefficient @xmath75 was in turn found to be insensitive to the decoupling condition at both collision energies .",
    "this insensitivity presumably follows from our full equilibrium treatment of the hrg phase .",
    "different hrg dynamics would change this behavior .",
    "however , when the decoupling condition is fixed at rhic to reproduce the hadron spectra , the freeze - out temperature is not expected to change significantly from rhic to the lhc @xcite .",
    "once the eos and the freeze - out parameters are fixed at rhic , we expect that the same parameters apply also at the lhc .",
    "once the multiplicities are fixed , the initial transverse profile remains as the largest uncertainty in the model .",
    "the effect of multiplicity on the elliptic flow coefficients at the lhc is studied by considering half the multiplicity that is predicted by the ekrt model .",
    "it is found that the integrated @xmath2 is quite sensitive to the multiplicity .",
    "the lower limit at the lhc , predicted by the ewn initialization , comes even slightly below the upper limit at rhic given by the ebc initialization .",
    "the differential @xmath75 is found to be less sensitive , but the upper limit given by the ebc model , is moved closer to the rhic results .",
    "we also note that we expect the applicability region of hydrodynamical modeling to extend higher in @xmath1 at the lhc than at rhic , because pions from jet fragmentation should start to dominate particle production over the hydrodynamical spectra at higher @xmath1 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "therefore we expect that the minimum bias @xmath75 will reach higher values at the lhc even if the low-@xmath1 results are similar to those measured at rhic .",
