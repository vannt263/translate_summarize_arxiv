    "superfluorescent pulses can be produced by @xmath0 collectively radiating identical atoms @xcite as these atoms decay from an initially excited state to the ground state .",
    "in contrast to such transient behavior would be the stationary output of the superradiant laser discussed in @xcite .",
    "collective behavior would be manifested in the proportionality of the output intensity to @xmath1 and of the linewidth to @xmath2 . moreover , as was shown in @xcite such a laser could display nearly perfect squeezing of the intensity fluctuations .",
    "the theory of a superradiant laser has up to now only been considered semiclassically in the stationary regime .",
    "as we shall show in the present paper , the semiclassical solution needs some quantum mechanical corrections for a finite number of atoms and low pumping amplitudes .",
    "we also propose to extend previous investigations towards a regime not allowing for a time independent stationary solution .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we consider the simplest model of a superradiant laser which accounts for @xmath0 three - level atoms placed inside a resonator , fig .",
    "we assume a resonant coherent two - photon pump process @xmath3 .",
    "the two transitions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are coupled to two resonant cavity modes @xmath6 , which are assumed to be so strongly damped that they are kept in adiabatic slavery by the atoms .",
    "+ the atoms are described by the collective population @xmath7 and polarisation @xmath8 operators @xmath9 .",
    "we shall represent these atomic observables by creation and annihilation operators @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12=\\delta_{ij}$ ] ; the two modes will be described by photon annihilation and creation operators @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath14 for atoms and field modes reads @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the amplitude of the external classical pump field , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the atom - field coupling constants for the transition @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "as the modes are damped we have to add the two irreversible time rates of change for the mode amplitudes @xmath6 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the two damping constants and @xmath24 the corresponding quantum langevin forces .",
    "the latter forces ensure the preservation of the bose commutators @xmath25=[b(t),b^\\dagger ( t)]=1 $ ] .",
    "the heisenberg - langevin equations for the system with cavity damping are now @xmath26 these equations have been solved before in @xcite under some assumptions that we shortly recapitulate here .",
    "first the @xmath27-mode is taken to be strongly damped so it can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "for later use we define the two damping constants @xmath28 : @xmath29 then an analytic solution can be given in the semiclassical limit @xmath30 in which the observables are represented as a sum @xmath31 of a dominant classical term @xmath32 and a `` small '' operator valued fluctuation @xmath33 .",
    "the classical term is evaluated in the stationary regime by dropping @xmath34 and the langevin forces .",
    "the resulting solutions can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless coupling strength @xmath35 and an effective pump strength @xmath36 : @xmath37 the solution for the level populations and the field amplitude is @xmath38 which is stable under the constraints @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the case we are interested in ( additional adiabatic elimination of the @xmath41-mode ) . notice that for @xmath42 and @xmath43 some of the observables vanish .",
    "this is in conflict to the assumption of a large mean value and small fluctuations , so the semiclassical approximation will break down at these points .",
    "moreover , this solution can not be correct in the limit @xmath42 since it does not correspond to the ground state @xmath44 .",
    "it is physically clear , however , that without pumping all atoms will eventually settle in the lowest state , due to damping of the levels @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to improve on the semiclassical prediction of a discontinuity of @xmath47 for @xmath48 we have to consider the full quantum mechanical solution",
    "this will be done in two ways .",
    "first , we develop a perturbative small-@xmath36 expansion .",
    "second , we give a recurrence relation for the whole stationary density operator @xmath49 which can be evaluated numerically .",
    "+ in the final section of this paper we shall take a look at the regime where ( [ eq : semi ] ) is not a stable solution anymore .",
    "for the discussion of the quantum mechanical solution we will switch to the master equation of the superradiant laser . additionally we assume the @xmath41-mode also to be so strongly damped that we can eliminate it adiabatically .",
    "the master equation then reads @xmath50 with @xmath51,\\\\    l_{21}\\rho&=&\\gamma_a\\{[s_{12},\\rho s_{21}]+[s_{12}\\rho , s_{21}]\\},\\\\    l_{10}\\rho&=&\\gamma_b\\{[s_{01},\\rho s_{10}]+[s_{01}\\rho , s_{10}]\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the discussion we expand @xmath49 in the fully symmetric and normalized states @xmath52 with @xmath53 atoms in level 2 , @xmath54 atoms in level 1 , and @xmath55 atoms in level 0 .",
    "the short - hand notation @xmath56 is used for the ground state .      in this subsection",
    "we take a closer look at the neighborhood of the point @xmath48 . for zero pumping",
    "the atoms will eventually all settle in the ground state , so the stationary density operator is @xmath57 . for small non - zero pumping @xmath58 may be expanded in a series @xmath59 where @xmath60 . with @xmath61",
    "the terms up to second order are @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 these entail the mean occupation numbers @xmath65 starting from the ground state the corrections are proportional to @xmath66 and @xmath67 is of order @xmath0 ( as the semiclassical solution ) for @xmath68 .",
    "thus the discontinuity of the semiclassical solution is smeared out over a range @xmath69 .",
    "further calculations show that the fluctuations of the observables vanish for @xmath70 .",
    "all of this is reminiscent of a first - order phase transition .",
    "having studied the perturbation expansion we now prepare to look for a complete quantum mechanical description .",
    "to that end we again expand the density operator @xmath49 in the states @xmath52 introduced above .",
    "one may check that coherences with respect to different numbers of atoms in level 1 decay to zero .",
    "we take this into account by the simple ansatz @xmath71 this expansion is inserted into ( [ eq : master1 ] ) and we find a recurrence relation for the stationary solution @xmath72 @xmath73 we have not managed to find an analytical solution to this equation , but have solved it numerically . since the number of involved variables is roughly proportional to @xmath74 , only up to 30 atoms have been considered .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . beside the corrections at @xmath48",
    "one can make out that the semiclassical solution has to be corrected for @xmath75 as well , as explained above . in the intermediate @xmath36 range",
    "the semiclassical result is quite good , even for the moderate values of @xmath0 studied . since the transition from quantum to semiclassical behavior",
    "can already be seen in our calculations , it seems not necessary to go to higher @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we consider the non - stationary solution of our system in the bad - cavity limit .",
    "as indicated in @xcite we expect to find a temporally periodic behavior of the laser field .",
    "so we set @xmath76 , where the semiclassical stationary solution is not stable .",
    "starting from the heisenberg - langevin equations ( [ heisenberg])-([heis2 ] ) , we assume strong , saturated driving between levels 0 and 2 , @xmath77 with the assumption of very fast relaxing cavity modes we can once more eliminate @xmath41 and @xmath27 adiabatically , @xmath78 @xmath79 and find a linear equation for @xmath80 @xmath81 z_1^{\\dagger } + a(t),\\ ] ] @xmath82 @xmath83 now equation ( [ z1dot ] ) is easily solved @xmath84 with @xmath85 clearly we encounter a periodic behavior with period @xmath86 .",
    "we use this as time scale and define the dimensionless parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 from this the mean number of photons in the @xmath41-mode is @xmath90 the time integration may be performed after expansion in terms of the bessel functions @xmath91 , @xmath92 and after the death of initial transients @xmath93 we get @xmath94 to illustrate the temporal periodicity of this solution we give some examples for various parameters @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for the limiting case @xmath96 , which implies small @xmath36",

    "this entails the need for a large number of atoms to make @xmath104 small , i.e. to get narrow and well separated pulses .",
    "the time - dependent spectrum of a light signal which accounts for the width of the filter @xmath105 is given as @xcite : @xmath106 since we have explicit expressions for the @xmath107 operators , we plug them in and after some integrations sending the width of the filter @xmath108 and the observation time @xmath109 we get the following time - averaged expression @xmath110   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad \\times \\left [ i_{l+1}\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right ) + \\    { \\rm i } i_{l}\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)\\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\left[\\frac{1}{d+{\\rm i}(2n+2l+1+\\omega/\\omega)}\\right .",
