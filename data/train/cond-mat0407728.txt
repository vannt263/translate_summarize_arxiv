    "recent experimental advances @xcite with ultracold trapped fermi atoms have produced systems of composite bosons ( dimers ) , where pairs of fermions bind due to their strong mutual attraction induced by a fano - feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of point - like bosons , for which the internal fermionic structure is immaterial , for the composite bosons the internal fermionic structure is relevant to the extent that their binding energy is comparable with the energy and temperature scales involved in the experiments .",
    "theoretical descriptions of the composite bosons should thus take into account not only their overall bosonic structure ( associated with their center - of - mass motion ) , but also their composite nature in terms of the degrees of freedom of the constituent fermions .",
    "any sensible theoretical approach to the bcs - bec crossover should rely on a _ single _ theory , that recovers controlled approximations on both sides of the crossover and provides a continuous evolution between them . in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "the approach originally developed by popov for a weakly - interacting ( dilute ) superfluid fermi gas @xcite was improved by including the effects of the bogoliubov - anderson mode @xcite in the diagonal fermionic self - energy . with this generalization",
    ", it was also shown @xcite that , in the strong - coupling limit of the fermionic attraction , the same theory is able to describe a dilute system of composite bosons within the bogoliubov approximation @xcite",
    ".    theoretical work on the condensates of dilute trapped bose gases @xcite has shown that an accurate description of the experimental data can be obtained by using the so - called popov bosonic approximation @xcite .",
    "this approximation leads to improvements over the bogoliubov approximation , in that it treats the densities of noncondensed and condensed atoms on the same footing , at least in the temperature range ( below the critical temperature ) where the two densities are comparable to each other .",
    "it has been shown that the use of the popov bosonic approximation is especially relevant to the thermodynamics of trapped bose atoms @xcite .",
    "it leads , in particular , to a downward shift of the critical temperature @xcite , which has been recently measured with great accuracy @xcite .",
    "the popov bosonic approximation was originally conceived for a homogeneous gas @xcite ; its extension to an inhomogeneous gas was described in detail in ref .  .",
    "purpose of the present paper is to devise a fermionic approximation for the bcs - bec crossover in the broken - symmetry phase , which in the strong - coupling limit of the fermionic attraction recovers the popov approximation for the composite bosons .",
    "we shall arrive to this popov approximation by successive improvements of the fermionic theory , starting initially from the bcs mean - field approximation and then including fluctuations over and above it at different levels of sophistication .",
    "the theory described already in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  )",
    "will be recovered as an intermediate step of this process .",
    "it will turn out that the popov description of the composite bosons on the strong - coupling side of the crossover corresponds to including pseudo - gap effects on top of the bcs approximation in the fermionic two - particle green s function on the weak - coupling side of the crossover .",
    "improvements of the theory on the strong - coupling side , as to get a more accurate description of the scattering processes between the composite bosons , will be further considered along the lines of ref .  .",
    "the issue to refine the theory on the weak - coupling side , as to include all possible contributions to an imperfect fermi gas @xcite , will instead be the subject of future study .    in the following",
    ", the theory of the bcs - bec crossover will be considered for a homogeneous system .",
    "extension to trapped gases may be done , in practice , by considering a local - density approximation , whereby the fermionic chemical potential @xmath0 is replaced whenever it occurs by the local quantity @xmath1 which includes the potential @xmath2 at position @xmath3 in the trap .",
    "this procedure has been already implemented at the bcs ( mean - field ) level in ref .",
    ", as well as with the inclusion of fluctuations in ref .",
    "( leading to the bogoliubov description of the composite bosons ) .",
    "our approach is built on a many - body hamiltonian for fermions only , with an effective mutual attraction represented by a point - contact interaction .",
    "it thus contrasts an alternative approach based on a boson - fermion model @xcite .",
    "it has , in fact , been shown @xcite that ( at least for the broad resonances currently used in most experiments ) a point - contact interaction is by far sufficient to get an accurate description of the relevant scattering properties .    the present paper deals with several kinds of approximations for the bcs - bec crossover at a formal level .",
    "in this respect , alternative strategies will be proposed which emphasize the different constraints one has to deal with to obtain a satisfactory description of the composite bosons in terms of the constituent fermions .",
    "detailed numerical calculations at the mean - field level and also with the inclusion of pairing fluctuations , which recover the bogoliubov description of the composite bosons , have already been presented in ref .  .",
    "quantitative comparison among the different kinds of additional approximations discussed in the present paper awaits further numerical calculations , to be considered separately .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , the steps leading to the bogoliubov description of the composite bosons ( discussed already in refs .   and )",
    "are reproposed , aiming at emphasizing the hierarchy of approximations for the fermions and the composite bosons . the role played in this context by the gap equation",
    "will be specifically discussed . in section iii",
    ", it will be shown how to modify the fermionic theory in order to describe the composite bosons within the popov approximation . in both ( bogoliubov and popov ) cases ,",
    "it will be also discussed how to enlarge the selection of the fermionic many - body diagrams , as to refine the description of the scattering processes between the composite bosons .",
    "section iv gives our conclusions .",
    "for the sake of completeness , the bogoliubov and popov descriptions for point - like bosons will be briefly recalled in the appendix .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , we will obtain the popov approximation for the composite bosons by setting up a scheme of _ successive approximations _ for the constituent fermions .",
    "to this end , it will be useful to retrace the essential steps which have previously led to the description of the composite bosons within the bogoliubov approximation ( cf .",
    "refs .   and ) . by this procedure ,",
    "the interplay between the approximations adopted for the constituent fermions ( which emerge especially on the bcs side of the crossover ) and the ensuing approximations for the composite bosons ( which are mostly relevant to the bec side of the crossover ) will become evident .",
    "the material presented in this section also serves for setting up the notation that will be needed in the following section , where the popov approximation for the composite bosons will be explicitly introduced .",
    "as also mentioned in the introduction , the present approach is based on a many - body hamiltonian for fermions only , with the ( effective ) mutual attraction represented by a point - contact potential @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a negative constant .",
    "this choice entails a suitable regularization in terms of a cutoff @xmath6 in wave - vector space , by taking the constant @xmath5 of the form ( in three dimensions ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fermion mass and @xmath9 the scattering length of the associated ( fermionic ) two - body problem @xcite . in this way",
    ", the relevant information about the two - body problem is fed into the many - body problem . by letting @xmath10 ( and thus @xmath11 )",
    "eventually , the classification of the ( fermionic ) many - body diagrams gets considerably simplified in the normal phase @xcite as well as in the broken - symmetry phase @xcite , since only specific diagrammatic substructures survive in the limit .",
    "the bcs mean field represents the simplest approximation for the bcs - bec crossover in the broken - symmetry phase . as such",
    ", it is often taken as a reference approximation for this crossover , at least at low enough temperatures @xcite . with this approximation , the fermionic single - particle green s functions ( in nambu s notation )",
    "are obtained by solving the dyson s equation in the form @xcite : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is a four - vector with wave vector @xmath14 and fermionic matsubara frequency @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being an integer and @xmath17 the inverse temperature ) , @xmath18 is the free - fermion propagator , and we set @xmath19 throughout .",
    "the isotropic ( @xmath16-wave ) bcs gap function @xmath20 is obtained by solving the equation : @xmath21 the regularization of the contact potential is provided in this context via the relation @xmath22 which defines the scattering length @xmath9 and is equivalent to eq .",

    "<S> theoretical treatments of the bcs - bec crossover need to provide as accurate as possible descriptions of the two regimes where the diluteness condition applies , either in terms of the constituent fermions ( bcs limit ) or of the composite bosons which form as bound - fermion pairs ( bec limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> this has to occur via a single fermionic theory that bridges across these two limiting representations . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we set up successive improvements of the fermionic theory , that result into composite bosons described at the level of either the bogoliubov or the popov approximations for point - like bosons . </S>",
    "<S> this work bears on the recent experimental advances on the bcs - bec crossover with trapped fermi atoms , which show the need for accurate theoretical descriptions of bec side of the crossover . </S>"
