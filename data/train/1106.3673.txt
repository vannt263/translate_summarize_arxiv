    "the geodesic flow on a riemannian manifold represents the extremals of the least action principle , namely it is determined by the motion of a certain physical system in the manifold .",
    "it is known that the geodesic equations are second order non - linear differential equations and they usually appear in the form of euler - lagrange equations of motion .",
    "magnetic curves generalize geodesics . in physics ,",
    "such a curve represents a trajectory of a charged particle moving on the manifold under the action of the magnetic field .",
    "let @xmath0 be an @xmath1-dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "a _ magnetic field _ is a closed 2-form @xmath2 on @xmath3 and the _ lorentz force _ of a magnetic field @xmath2 on @xmath0 is an @xmath4 tensor field @xmath5 given by @xmath6 the _ magnetic trajectories _ of @xmath2 are curves @xmath7 on @xmath3 that satisfy the _ lorentz equation _ ( sometimes called the _ newton equation _ ) @xmath8    lorentz equation generalizes the equation satisfied by the geodesics of @xmath3 , namely @xmath9 therefore , from the point of view of the dynamical systems , a geodesic corresponds to a trajectory of a particle without an action of a magnetic field , while a magnetic trajectory is _ a flowline of the dynamical system _ , associated with the magnetic field .",
    "since the lorentz force is skew symmetric we have @xmath10 so the magnetic curves ( trajectories ) have constant speed @xmath11 .",
    "when the magnetic curve @xmath12 is arc length parametrized @xmath13 , it is called a _",
    "normal magnetic curve_.    recall that a vector field @xmath14 on @xmath3 is _ killing _ if and only if it satisfies the killing equation : @xmath15 for every vector fields @xmath16 on @xmath3 , where @xmath17 is the levi civita connection on @xmath3 .",
    "a typical example of uniform magnetic fields is obtained by multiplying the volume form on a riemannian surface by a scalar @xmath18 ( usually called _ strength _ ) .",
    "when the surface is of constant gaussian curvature @xmath19 , trajectories of such magnetic fields are well known .",
    "more precisely , on the sphere @xmath20 , @xmath21 , trajectories are small ( euclidean ) circles of radius @xmath22 , on the euclidean plane they are circles and the period of motion equals to @xmath23 , while , on a hyperbolic plane @xmath24 , @xmath21 , trajectories can be either closed curves ( when @xmath25 ) , or open curves . moreover , when @xmath26 normal trajectories are horocycles ( see e.g. ) .",
    "this problem was extended also for different ambient spaces .",
    "for example , if the ambient is a complex space form , khler magnetic fields are studied ( see @xcite ) , in particular , explicit trajectories for khler magnetic fields are found in the complex projective space @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "khler magnetic fields appear in theoretical and mathematical physics , varying from quantum field theory and string theory to general relativity .",
    "if the ambient is a contact manifold , the fundamental 2-form defines the so - called _ contact magnetic field_. interesting results are obtained when the manifold is sasakian , namely the angle between the velocity of a normal magnetic curve and the reeb vector field is constant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , explicit description for normal flowlines of the contact magnetic field on a 3-dimensional sasakian manifold is known @xcite .    in the case of a 3-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath28",
    ", 2-forms and vector fields may be identified via the hodge star operator @xmath29 and the volume form @xmath30 of the manifold .",
    "thus , magnetic fields mean divergence free vector fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , killing vector fields define an important class of magnetic fields , called _ killing magnetic fields_. it is known that geodesics can be defined as extremal curves for the action energy functional . a variational approach to describe killing magnetic flows in spaces of constant curvature is given in @xcite .",
    "note that , one can define on @xmath3 the _ cross product _ of two vector fields @xmath31 as follows @xmath32 if @xmath14 is a killing vector field on @xmath3 , let @xmath33 be the corresponding killing magnetic field .",
    "by @xmath34 we denote the inner product .",
    "then , the lorentz force of @xmath35 is ( see @xcite ) @xmath36 consequently , the lorentz force equation ( [ lorentzeq ] ) can be written as @xmath37    in what follows we consider the 3-dimensional euclidian space @xmath38 , endowed with the usual scalar product @xmath39 .",

    "its trajectories are helices with axis @xmath46 , namely @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "an interesting fact is that lancret curves ( i.e. general helices ) in @xmath38 are characterized by the following property ( in our framework ) : they are magnetic trajectories associated with magnetic fields parallel to their axis . a similar result , relating killing magnetic fields and lancret curves is provided on the 3-sphere ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "theorems of lancret for general helices in 3-dimensional real space forms are presented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the following magnetic field @xmath50 in @xmath38 , determined by the killing vector field @xmath51 .",
    "the other two rotational vector fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 give rise to analogue classifications for corresponding magnetic trajectories .",

    "the main result we obtain is the following :    * theorem .",
    "* _ the magnetic trajectories of the killing magnetic field @xmath35 are : ( a ) planar curves situated in a vertical strip ; ( b ) circular helices and ( c ) curve parametrized by _ @xmath54 _ where @xmath55 and @xmath56 satisfy _",
