    "the experimental verification of the formulae for the perihelion precession of mercury and for the bending angle of light passing near massive bodies such as our sun , are the two most spectacular confirmations of einstein s theory of general relativity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the efforts of einstein in order to explain these two phenomena played an important role in the development of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that newton s universal gravitational law , which can not account for the observed perihelion advancement and which gives only half of the experimentally observed light bending angle , is not accurate enough under relativistic conditions @xcite .",
    "however , when employing newton s universal gravitational law under relativistic conditions , little attention has been paid to the fact that there exist differences between the rest , relativistic , inertial and gravitational masses , of the bodies involved .    the inertial mass , @xmath11 , and the gravitational mass , @xmath12 , are equal according to the equivalence principle @xcite , but the ratio of the inertial mass to the rest mass and also the ratio of the relativistic mass , @xmath13 , to the rest mass are unbounded as the particle velocity approaches the speed of light @xcite .    consequently , the following important question arises when using newton s universal gravitational law under conditions where the lorentz factor @xmath14 is significantly larger than unity : should one use the particle rest mass , @xmath15 , the relativistic mass , @xmath13 , or the gravitational mass , @xmath12 , which equals the inertial mass , @xmath11 ?",
    "this question has been addressed recently in @xcite , where it is argued that one should use the gravitational mass , @xmath12 , rather than the rest mass , @xmath15 , or the relativistic mass , @xmath13 .",
    "perhaps one of the reasons that this question was not discussed earlier is that the velocities of the planets of our planetary system are of the order @xmath16 , thus the corresponding lorentz factors are of the order of @xmath17 and therefore the differences between rest , relativistic , and gravitational masses are very small , which is also the case for the magnitude of the perihelion precession value per orbit and of the light bending angle caused by our sun . however , this is not the case for many other astronomical systems involving heavier stars @xcite .",
    "the inertial mass , @xmath11 , and hence according to the equivalence principle , the gravitational mass @xmath12 , is related with the rest mass , @xmath15 , via the equation @xmath18    this result for linear motion was first obtained in einstein s pioneering special relativity paper @xcite ; it has been argued recently @xcite that this result remains valid for an arbitrary particle motion , including circular motion .",
    "consequently , newton s universal gravitational law for the gravitational force between two particles , at a distance @xmath19 , of rest masses @xmath20 and moving with a velocity @xmath21 relative to each other , is given by @xmath22    if @xmath23 , the above equation reduces to @xmath24    by employing equation ( [ eq3 ] ) it is possible to predict the existence of gravitationally confined circular rotational states with many of the properties of hadrons @xcite , or bosons @xcite , and to show that the rest masses of quarks are very small , in the mass range of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "furthremore , using equation ( [ eq3 ] ) it can be shown that the ratio @xmath25 of the force , @xmath26 , keeping two or three - particle systems in orbit , divided by the same force computed for @xmath27 , is @xmath28 , which is exactly the value predicted by gr @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath29.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    for the motion of a particle with rest mass @xmath15 rotating around a massive particle of rest mass @xmath30 , equation ( [ eq2 ] ) remains valid .",
    "indeed , consider for example the sun ( mass @xmath30 ) and mercury ( mass @xmath15 ) at the locations of two instantaneous inertial systems , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , ( fig .",
    "1 ) moving with an instantaneous velocity @xmath21 relative to each other . in this case , the inertial and thus the gravitational inertial mass of mercury is given by @xmath33 according to the observer on the sun at @xmath31 , but also the inertial mass of sun is given by @xmath34 according to the observer on mercury at @xmath32 .",
    "if one uses rest masses instead of inertial masses then , according to newtonian mechanics the particle of mass @xmath15 moves on an ellipse . consider such an ellipse with an elliptical parameter @xmath29 ( also known as the semi - latus rectum ) , with eccentricity @xmath35 , and with a semi - major axis @xmath36 ; these parameters are related by the equation @xmath37    gr implies the following expression for the precession angle , @xmath1 , @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes angular momentum per unit mass .    using the momentum - velocity equation of special relativity ( sr ) ,",
    "namely momentum equals @xmath40 , lemmon and mondragon examined in @xcite the resulting corrections to keplerian orbits and to the precession angle @xmath1 .",
    "their work , which does not take into consideration equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , yields one sixth of the value computed via gr ( equation ( [ eq5 ] ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that silberstein already back in 1917 @xcite attempted to account for the velocity dependence of the rotating mass @xmath41 by combining @xmath42 with the empirical force expression @xmath43    he reported that he could get agreement with the gr result of equation ( [ eq5 ] ) provided that @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "he noted that it was entirely unclear to him why this particular value of @xmath46 leads to exact agreement with gr @xcite .",
    "furthermore , silberstein only analysed the relevant equations in the limit of @xmath47 , where @xmath21 is the velocity of the rotating particle .    here ,",
    "for the sake of completness we first present a simple rederivation of the well known @xcite gr expression @xmath48 where @xmath49 in equations ( [ eq8 ] ) , @xmath50 is the angular momentum of the particle of mass @xmath41 , @xmath51 is the mass of the heavier body , @xmath52 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath39 is the angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "we then present the first main result of our paper : if a particle of mass @xmath41 moves around a heavier mass @xmath51 under the influence of the relativistic gravitational law ( [ eq2 ] ) , then @xmath53 satisfies the ordinary differential equation @xmath54\\right\\}^{-3},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denotes quantities computed via equations ( [ eq1 ] ) to ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that for small @xmath57 the dominant parts of the solutions of equations ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) are both given by the expression @xmath58 and thus , the precession angle per revolution , @xmath3 , is given in both cases by @xmath59 which using the definition of @xmath57 in the third of equations ( [ eq8 ] ) becomes the well known formulae ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that one may consider a third instantaneous inertial system , @xmath60 , with an observer , located on earth and with a velocity @xmath61 with respect to one of the two moving bodies .",
    "this second velocity @xmath61 , and the corresponding lorentz factor , @xmath62 , defines the ratio @xmath63 of the relativistic and rest masses of mercury as observed from @xmath60 , i.e. from the earth .",
    "since @xmath15 is not amenable to direct observation , and also since @xmath1 should be independent of @xmath60 , we may set @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath65 be cylindrical coordinates in a plane containing the center of the sun , and let @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath50 denote the proper time , energy , and angular momentum respectively .",
    "the basic equations of gr are conservation of energy and of angular momentum , as well as the schwarzschild metric equation : @xmath68    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the schwarzschild radius of the sun and @xmath51 is the mass of the sun .    solving equations ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) for @xmath73 and @xmath74 in terms of @xmath75 , substituting the resulting expressions into ( [ eq15 ] ) , and then solving the resulting equation for @xmath76 we find @xmath77    making the substitution @xmath78 equation ( [ eq17 ] ) becomes @xmath79    differentiating this equation with respect to @xmath80 and introducing the dimensionless quantities defined in equations ( [ eq8 ] ) we find equation ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "consider a single particle of relativistic mass @xmath81 and of gravitational mass @xmath12 moving under the influence of a central force of magnitude @xmath82 .",
    "then , @xmath83    incidentaly , in the particular case that @xmath84 , using the definition of @xmath14 , i.e. the second of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , we find @xmath85    hence , @xmath86 it is shown in the appendix that @xmath87 and then equation ( [ eq21 ] ) takes the familiar form found in most books , namely @xmath88    starting with ( [ eq19 ] ) , it is straightforward to derive the following results :    1 .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath89 is conserved , where @xmath89 is defined by @xmath90 furthermore , the magnitude of the angular momentun denoted by @xmath50 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 are cylindrical coordinates in the plane of motion which clearly is orthogonal to @xmath50 .",
