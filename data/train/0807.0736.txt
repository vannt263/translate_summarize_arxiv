    "among the objects that demonstrate bose - einstein condensation or superconductivity considerable attention is given to two - component systems .",
    "particularly , beginning from the paper by andreev and bashkin @xcite the possibility of a non - dissipative drag between superfluid ( superconducting ) components moving with different velocities was discussed @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) . the andreev - bashkin effect was also considered in astrophysics in the context of superfluid models of neutron stars @xcite . a related problem - the critical velocities in two - component superfluid systems",
    "was studied in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "it was shown that critical velocities are essentially different in the case when two components move with the same velocities and in the case when one of the components does not move . in the latter case",
    "the critical velocity of a moving component can be much higher .",
    "although two - component superfluid atomic bose gases have been realized in laboratories @xcite , there are certain problems in experimental observation of the effects caused by relative motion of the components . on the one hand , it is not so simple to create a relative flow of superfluid components in a mixture of bose gases . on the other hand ,",
    "a spatial separation of components takes place in two - component mixtures confined in a trap . in the gases with point interaction the spatial separation results in a disappearance of the effects caused by inter - specie interaction . to overcome these difficulties one can turn to systems where components can be kept spatially separated in a controllable way ( that gives a possibility to provide a flow of the components with different velocities ) .",
    "the interaction between the components in such systems should contain a long - range part .",
    "for example , one can deal with a bose gas with dipole - dipole interaction confined in a double - layer trap @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a solid - state system where a two - component bose gas with the dipole - dipole interaction can be realized .",
    "we consider a multilayer electron system where electrons from one layer couple with holes from the adjacent layer .",
    "since such bose particles ( electron - hole pairs ) have a small mass they may demonstrate superfluid behavior at rather high temperatures ( much higher than required for the bose - einstein condensation of alkali metal vapors ) .",
    "electron - hole pairs in such systems have large dipole momentum and the dipole - dipole interaction determines , in the main part , collective properties of a gas of such pairs .    to be more specific , we consider a four - layer electron system in a strong perpendicular to the layers magnetic field ( a multilayer quantum hall system ) . for bilayer quantum hall systems with total filling factor equal to unity",
    "the theory predicts @xcite the existence of a superfluid condensate of indirect excitons in the systems .",
    "an indirect exciton corresponds to a bound state of an electron belonging to one layer and a hole ( an empty state in the lowest landau level ) belonging to the other layer .",
    "this prediction was partially confirmed in experiments @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensation of metastable ( optically generated ) indirect excitons in zero magnetic field was also observed @xcite .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , multi - component excitonic superfluid condensates can be realized in multilayer quantum hall systems with even number of the layers and the average filling factor per layer equal to one - half .",
    "according to @xcite , electron - hole pairs emerge in separate bilayers , i.e. , a given excitonic component belongs to a given double - layer complex .",
    "here we consider a four - layer system with the filling factors of the layers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "in such a system one specie is formed by coupled electrons and holes from the layers 1 and 2 , while the other specie - by coupled carriers from the layers 3 and 4 ( figure [ figure1 ] ) .    in the system considered a flow of electron - hole pairs is equivalent to two oppositely directed electrical currents in the adjacent layers .",
    "therefore , a superfluid state of such pairs can be considered as a specific superconducting state .",
    "counterflow supercurrents can carry an electrical current from the source situated at one end of the system to the load situated at the opposite end ( if the interlayer tunnelling is negligible small , the dissipation is negligible , as well @xcite ) .",
    "experimentally one can provide separate contacts to each layer .",
    "it allows to control and measure the supercurrents in each bilayer complex .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to formulate the problems not in terms of superfluid velocities , but in terms of supercurrents . in this paper",
    "we address two problems .",
    "first , we investigate critical currents in a four - layer quantum hall system .",
    "we show that the behavior of critical currents is qualitative the same as of critical velocities in two - component bose gases ( with the important advantage that the effect in multilayers can be registered by electrical measurements ) .",
    "then , we consider the non - dissipative drag between the components and compute the drag factor .",
    "we predict very large drag factor for quantum hall multilayers : under appropriate conditions it can reach 10 per sent ( in three order higher than the most optimistic estimates for atomic bose gases ) .",
    "our study is based on the analysis of collective mode spectra .",
    "we follow the approach proposed in @xcite for the study of bilayer systems with zero imbalance of filling factors ( @xmath4 ) . in sec.[s2 ] we extend the approach @xcite for the case of an arbitrary imbalance . in sec.[s3 ] we obtain the spectra of excitations for the four - layer system , find the critical interlayer distance versus the filling factor , and obtain the relation between the critical currents .",
    "the non - dissipative drag effect is considered in sec.[s4 ] .",
    "let us begin with the discussion of a mechanism that determines critical supercurrents in quantum hall bilayers ( multilayers ) . in bulk superconductors the restriction on the value of the supercurrent emerges from the requirement that the magnetic field produced by electrical currents should be lower than the thermodynamic critical magnetic field . for thin films",
    "the critical magnetic field is higher than for bulk superconductors , and at small thickness @xmath5 of the film it increases by the law @xmath6 . due to almost two - dimensional character of conducting layers in quantum hall systems",
    "the critical magnetic field should be high .",
    "the critical current is determined by an essentially different mechanism .",
    "this mechanism is just the generalization of the landau mechanism of destruction of superfluidity ( governed by the landau criterion ) .",
    "the critical current can be found from the requirement that in a superconducting state the energies of all collective excitations being real valued and positive .",
    "going ahead we note that electrical currents close to critical ones produce magnetic fields much smaller than the terrestrial magnetic field . and , indeed , the magnetic mechanism of destruction of superconductivity is irrelevant for the quantum hall bilayers ( multilayers ) .    for more transparency , we will describe the approach with reference to a bilayer system .",
    "let a double - layer electron system is situated in a perpendicular to the layers magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "the electron density @xmath8 satisfies the condition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the magnetic length , i.e. the filling factor of the layer 1 is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and the filling factor of the layer 2 is @xmath13 .",
    "the value @xmath14 is the parameter of the problem . since @xmath15",
    "all the carriers belong to the lowest landau level ( under assumption that the coulomb energy is small compared to the energy gap between the landau levels ) .",
    "we take the hamiltonian in the lowest landau level approximation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the area of the layer , @xmath18 is the fourier - component of the coulomb potential , @xmath19 is the distance between the layers , @xmath20 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath21 is the fourier - component of the electron density in the @xmath22-th layer . in ( [ 5a ] )",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons in the @xmath22-th layer in the state described by the wave function @xmath25 .",
    "we imply that the interlayer tunnelling amplitude @xmath26 is much smaller than the coulomb energy @xmath27 and neglect the tunnelling in the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "we will discuss the validity of such an approximation in more details at the end of this section .",
    "here we just mention that in the bilayer systems used in experiments the tunneling amplitude @xmath28 @xmath29k @xcite that is in 6 order smaller than the coulomb energy .",

    "it is instructive to compare the spectrum ( [ 39 ] ) with the bogolyubov spectrum .",
    "let us introduce formal notations @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath22 and present eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) in the bogolyubov form @xmath89 in ( [ 39 - 1 ] ) the kinetic energy is defined as @xmath90 in the long wave limit ( @xmath91 ) this quantity is reduced to the standard expression for the kinetic energy @xmath92 , where @xmath93 ^ { -1}\\ ] ] is the magnetic mass of the pair ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in ( [ 39 - 1 ] )",
    "the density is defined as @xmath94 . in the limit @xmath95 ( or @xmath96 ) this quantity coincides with the density of electron - hole pairs ( in this case one",
    "can easily mark out the pairs from the background , see figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath97 appears due to the electron - hole symmetry of the problem .    the superfluid velocity in ( [ 39 - 1 ] )",
    "is defined as @xmath98 at @xmath91 it reduces to the expression @xmath99 that differs from the common expression for the superfluid velocity by the factor @xmath100 . at small @xmath101",
    "this factor approaches unity and the difference disappears , but at zero imbalance ( @xmath102 ) it is equal to zero and the last term in ( [ 39 - 1 ] ) vanishes .",
    "this feature can be understood from the following arguments .",
    "the sign of @xmath103 ( gradient of the phase ) determines the direction of the current .",
    "if one describes the supercurrent as motion of electron - hole pairs then the direction of the current depends on the direction of the superfluid velocity and on the direction of polarization of electron - hole pairs ( figure [ figure2 ] ) . therefore at given @xmath103 the filling factors @xmath104 and @xmath105 corresponds to opposite directions of superfluid velocities .",
    "the factor @xmath106 changes its sign under substitution @xmath107 and its appearance in the expression for @xmath87 reflects to the electron - hole symmetry of the problem .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath88 in ( [ 39 - 1 ] ) is given by the expression @xmath108.\\ ] ] the first term in ( [ 40 - 2 ] ) is caused by the direct coulomb interaction between dipoles , two other terms correspond to the exchange interaction .",
    "one can see that at small @xmath109 the direct interaction term reduces to @xmath110 .",
    "it is just the interaction parameter for a two - dimensional gas of classical dipoles ( polarized perpendicular to the layer ) .",
    "we also note that in the limit @xmath111 ( in which the pairs do not interact with each other ) the quantity ( [ 40 - 2 ] ) approaches zero , and the collective excitation spectrum ( [ 39 - 1 ] ) turns to the spectrum of free particles @xmath112 ( at @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "thus , the spectrum ( [ 39 ] ) is similar to the bogolyubov spectrum but there are certain differences caused by the electron - hole symmetry . the answer ( [ 39 ] ) at @xmath102 coincides with the spectrum obtained in @xcite . in the low density limit @xmath115 ( low concentration of the pairs ) and at small @xmath109",
    "the result ( [ 39 ] ) reduces to one found in @xcite on the base of the gross - pitaevskii equation .    according to the landau criterium the energy ( [ 39 ] )",
    "should be positive and real - valued for all @xmath109 . at @xmath116 ( critical @xmath117 depends on @xmath101 ) the spectrum becomes complex - valued already at @xmath113 .",
    "it means that at given @xmath19 and @xmath101 the superfluid state can not be realized at all . at @xmath118",
    "the landau condition violates at @xmath119 .",
    "the value @xmath120 ( that depends on @xmath101 and @xmath121 ) determines the critical current .",
    "the relation between @xmath120 and the critical current can be obtained as follows . at nonzero vector potential the phase gradient @xmath103 in the energy ( [ 6 - 1 ] ) should be replaced with the gauge invariant quantity @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a vector potential in the @xmath124-th layer . in a given layer the current ( density of the current ) is obtained from the equation @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the energy per unit area . taking into account ( [ g1 ] ) , one finds @xmath127 , or , in the explicit form , @xmath128 substituting eq.([63 ] ) into ( [ cur ] ) one obtains the following relation between @xmath103 and the current @xmath129 at small @xmath103 ( @xmath130 ) the current is proportional to the phase gradient : @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the superfluid stiffness",
    ".    one can easy check that the value of integral in ( [ cur1 ] ) at any @xmath103 and @xmath19 does not exceed 0.45 .",
    "therefore , in any case the supercurrent is less than @xmath133 . at typical parameters @xmath134 ,",
    "@xmath135 one evaluates @xmath136 a / m .",
    "note this value of counterflow currents corresponds to very small value of parallel to the layers component of magnetic field produced by the current ( @xmath137 t ) . under accounting the landau criterium",
    "this quantity is even smaller .",
    "now let us discuss the influence of tunnelling on the critical current .",
    "in general case the tunnelling reduces the critical current , moreover it may destroy the superfluid state completely @xcite .",
    "to explain this effect it is instructive to introduce the josephson length @xmath138 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "this quantity determines the size of the soliton ( josephson vortex ) in the bilayer quantum hall system .",
    "if the josephson length is small @xmath139 and the gradient of the phase caused by the soliton is large ( larger than the critical gradient @xmath140 ) the tunnelling influences significantly on the critical parameters .",
    "but such @xmath141 correspond to quite large tunnelling amplitudes ( @xmath142 for @xmath102 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "thus , in a common experimental situation ( @xmath144 ) the tunnelling can be neglected almost for all relevant values of @xmath101 and @xmath121 .",
    "let us turn to the consideration of the four - layer quantum hall system where a two - component superfluid gas of electron - hole pairs can emerge . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the system with equal distances between the adjacent layers .",
    "we specify the case where supercurrents in both components are directed along the same axis .",

    "@xcite the electron - hole pairs are formed separately in the @xmath145 bilayer complex and in the @xmath146 bilayer complex .",

    "substitute them into ( [ 1001 ] ) .",
    "the details of such a procedure are described in @xcite .",
    "here we present the final expression for the drag factor @xmath225 where @xmath226 are the energies of collective excitations at @xmath183 .",
    "since the problem has one energy parameter ( the coulomb energy @xmath227 ) the drag factor ( [ 82 ] ) depends only on dimensionless quantities @xmath121 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 . the dependence of the drag factor on the filling factor ( @xmath230 ) at different @xmath121 is shown in figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "one can see that this dependence has an extremum at small @xmath101 ( small density of the pairs ) .",
    "similar feature was obtained for the atomic bose gases with dipole - dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "the specific feature is a sharp increase of the drag factor near critical @xmath101 ( or @xmath19 , see figure [ figure6 ] ) .",
    "the effect is caused by a roton - like minimum in the spectrum of the lowest collective mode ( figure [ figure7 ] ) .",
    "other specific features are the vanishing of the drag effect at @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) , and the alternation of the sign of the drag factor under change of sign of the filling factor imbalance ( @xmath228 to @xmath233 or @xmath234 to @xmath235 ) .",
    "the alternation of the direction of the drag current can be observed if one keeps one of the filling factor constant , while the other filling factor tunes from @xmath236 to @xmath237 .",
    "this feature can be understood from the electron - hole symmetry argumentation ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] ) .",
    "but the main feature is large absolute values of the drag factor ( in @xmath238 times larger than the most optimistic figures for the atomic bose gases ) .",
    "large values of the effect are caused by a number of factors . as follows from the consideration @xcite the drag effect in two - dimensional systems can be larger than in three - dimensional ones , but for bose gases in bilayer traps large values are not reached due to weak interspecie interaction .",
    "fortunately , in quantum hall multilayers the interaction between different superfluid components is of the same order as the interaction inside a given component .",
    "moreover , the intra - component interaction is reduced due to the exchange interaction . at last , the drag effect is enhanced considerable by the presence of the roton - like minimum in the energy spectrum , and this minimum becomes deeper at interlayer distances or filling factors close to critical ones ( figure [ figure7 ] ) .",
    "all these factors work in favor of the drag effect and result in a giant drag factor in comparison with atomic two - component bose systems .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied superfluid properties of a two - component gas of electron - hole pairs in a quantum hall four - layer system .",
    "we have found that the critical parameters ( critical interlayer distance and critical currents ) for this system are slightly less but of the same order as in bilayers .",
    "the critical currents in the two - component gas of electron - hole pairs demonstrate the behavior similar to one of atomic two - component bose gases .",
    "in particular , the largest value of the critical current in a given component can be reached if the current in the other component is equal to zero . in multilayer quantum hall systems",
    "this peculiar behavior of two - components superfluids can be observed by electrical measurements . the non - dissipative drag effect between the components is predicted .",
    "the effect takes place only at nonzero imbalance of filling factors of each ( top and bottom ) bilayer , and the drag current alternates its direction under change of sign of the imbalance in one of the bilayers .",
    "the drag factors is quite large , and the largest values can be achieved at the interlayer distances close to the critical ones .",
