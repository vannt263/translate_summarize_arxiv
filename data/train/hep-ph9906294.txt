    "the deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) process , @xmath0 has provided a wealth of information about the structure of the proton , or more specifically , the hadronic matrix element : @xmath1 .",
    "recently , it was realized that one can actually investigate the non - diagonal hadronic matrix element @xmath2 via the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) process @xmath3 .",
    "this dvcs process differs from the dis process in that the outgoing photon is on - shell , and hence the final hadron @xmath4 must absorb a small amount of momentum @xmath5 to satisfy the kinematics.@xcite the net result of the dvcs analysis is to obtain a generalized parton distribution function ( pdf ) which depends on two scaling variables , @xmath6 , _ cf .",
    "_ , fig.1 .",
    "various sum rules can be derived to relate these dvcs distributions @xmath7 to the usual pdf s , @xmath8.@xcite",
    "we want to analyze this new dvcs sub - field using some older techniques , namely regge theory , to obtain analytic expressions for the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the key idea that we will use from regge analysis is that if we confine our kinematics to the _ strip regions _ of the mandelstam diagram ( fig.2 ) , then the amplitude can accurately be described by a simple pole structure .",
    "if we stray beyond these strip regions into the rest of the physical region , then we are too far from low - energy crossed - channel poles to be dominated by them .",
    "therefore , we will limit our analysis to one of two regions : + 1 ) the forward region : @xmath9 , and + 2 ) the backward region : @xmath10 , + with , of course @xmath11 .",
    "since the higher order qcd corrections to the dvcs process ( fig.1 ) do not violate the born spin structure , the general dvcs amplitude is : @xmath12 $ ] , with : @xmath13 we differentiate w.r.t .",
    "@xmath14 to obtain the infrared evolution equation ( iree ) : @xmath15 analysis of @xmath16 yields the solution : @xmath17",
    "we decompose @xmath16 into spin - dependent and spin - independent terms , @xmath19 we first obtain the spin - dependent asymptotic behavior in the regge limit ( large s ) for the forward region ( @xmath20 ) : @xmath21 with @xmath22^{1/2}$ ]    in a similar manner , for the spin - independent part , we obtain : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pomeron intercept , and @xmath25 is the pomeron anomalous dimension .",
    "consequently , we find the asymptotic forward scattering amplitude takes the form of the compton scattering amplitude times a sudakov exponential factor .",
    "for the backward dvcs process ( @xmath27 ) , the analysis is simpler because there is no difference between asymptotic behavior of the polarized and unpolarized amplitude @xmath28 .",
    "we obtain at the final expression : @xmath29 the dvcs amplitude in the backward scattering region is purely of the sudakov type with an exponential factor .",
    "here we highlight some differences of this work in comparison to the dglap analysis . for the calculation of the spin - dependent amplitude @xmath30 in the @xmath31 limit ,",
    "we define @xmath32 via a mellin transform : @xmath33 the iree for the spin - dependent part takes the following form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mellin amplitude for quark - quark elastic scattering with all quarks on - shell . putting all the pieces together ,",
    "we obtain for @xmath30 : @xmath36 note that if we expand @xmath35 keeping the leading powers of @xmath37 , we arrive at the standard leading - order dglap leading order expression for the dvcs .",
    "the dglap incorporates both singular and non - singular contributions from a finite number of terms . here",
    ", we instead resum only the singular contributions from an infinite number of terms to double - log accuracy .",
    "while we neglect the nonsingular terms , this does not affect the asymptotic behavior.@xcite",
    "now that we have expressions for the asymptotic forward and backward amplitudes , @xmath16 and @xmath28 , we can relate these quantities to the total amplitude which , for @xmath20 is given by : @xmath38 _ cf . _ , fig.3 . using the sudakov representation for the kinematic variables",
    ", we can easily evaluate @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the asymptotic limit , and then invert these equations to obtain analytic expressions for the non - forward structure functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we find the following non - forward structure functions:@xcite @xmath43 \\left[\\theta\\left(\\beta-\\frac{\\zeta}{2}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{1-\\beta}\\beta \\right)^\\omega + \\theta\\left(\\frac{\\zeta}{2}-\\beta\\right )   \\left(\\frac{1-\\beta}{\\zeta -\\beta } \\right)^\\omega \\right ] \\end{array }   \\label{eq : fquark}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath44 \\left[\\theta\\left(\\beta-\\frac{\\zeta}{2}\\right )   \\left(\\frac{1+\\beta-\\zeta}\\beta \\right)^\\omega + \\theta\\left(\\frac{\\zeta}{2}-\\beta\\right )   \\left(\\frac{1+\\beta-\\zeta } { \\zeta -\\beta}\\right)^\\omega \\right ] \\end{array } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding @xmath45 structure functions are expressed via analogous formulas . here",
    ", @xmath46 are the standard @xmath47- and @xmath48-channel regge amplitudes .",
    "the regge limit implies the argument of the mellin transform is be asymptotically large , which corresponds to the the region where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "note that the pair of @xmath51-functions yields the full support in the variable @xmath52 .",
    "deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) provides a means to expand our knowledge of the hadron structure and extract information on new quantities such as the non - diagonal hadronic matrix element : @xmath53 . via the iree",
    ", we have resummed singular terms in @xmath37 to double logarithmic accuracy . while we have neglected the non - singular terms ( _ eg .",
    "_ , as included in the dglap approach ) , these do not contribute in the asymptotic region .",
    "this allows us to obtain expressions for the structure functions in the forward and backward regions in the regge limit .",
    "as we have not used the dglap evolution equations , which assume the transverse momenta to be strictly ordered in virtuality , we include important logarithmic contributions which extend the realm of applicability ."
