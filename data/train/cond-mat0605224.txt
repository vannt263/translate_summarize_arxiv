    "evidences have accumulated in recent years that the peak effect ( pe ) phenomenon in critical current density ( @xmath9 ) located at the edge of the depinning process is distinct from the second magnetization peak ( smp ) anomaly commencing at field values deeper in the mixed state of the weakly pinned superconducting samples of several low @xmath10 and high @xmath10 compounds , e.g. , ca@xmath3rh@xmath4sn@xmath5 @xcite , rni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath11 ) @xcite , v@xmath3si @xcite , @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 @xcite , pros@xmath4sb@xmath12 @xcite , yba@xmath1cu@xmath3o@xmath13 @xcite , etc . in collective pinning @xcite scenarios ,",
    "the critical current density can be related to the length scales over which the displacements of the flux lines from their equilibrium positions remain correlated . in such frameworks ,",
    "an anomalous increase in field / temperature ( h / t ) variation of @xmath9 can be construed to imply a decrease in the correlation volume over which flux lines remain elastically deformed and collectively pinned , thereby , leading to the notion of order - disorder transformation in the underlying flux line lattice ( fll ) @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of two anomalous variations in @xmath14 ( e.g. , the smp and the pe ) in a given isothermal scan may , therefore , imply that the disordering of the ordered lattice can proceed in two distinct steps , before reaching the depinning limit in the bulk of the sample @xcite . a notion of weak",
    "pinning by surface inhomogeneities may survive , after crossing the bulk depinning limit , upto the upper critical field ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the metastability effects @xcite in single crystals of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 , which display a smp like anomaly prior to pe , have revealed that ordered and disordered regions co - exist from above the onset position of smp anomaly upto a limiting temperature , designated as the spinodal temperature ( @xmath16 ) , which lies above the peak position of pe @xcite . a spinodal line is the locus of @xmath17 above which the path dependence in @xmath18 is absent @xcite .",
    "the notion of spinodal line is rationalized by terming the order - disorder transition in fll of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 system to have a first order character , in analogy to the fll melting line in the weakly pinned crystals of high @xmath10 bismuth cuprates @xcite .",
    "li and rosenstein @xcite have theroetically argued that metastability associated with the order - disorder first order transition line could span a large part of the ( @xmath19 ) phase space , starting from the spinodal line and extending sufficiently below the boundary marking the onset position of the order - disorder transition .",
    "using fast current ramp procedures in transport measurements , xiao _ et al _ @xcite had exemplified the notion of a generic spinodal line via a normalized field - temperature ( @xmath20 ) plots in a number of crystals of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 , which are in agreement with the theoretical results of li - rosenstein @xcite .",
    "the single crystal samples studied by xiao _",
    "et al _ @xcite displayed only the pe phenomenon . extending these studies , li _",
    "et al _ @xcite have recently exploited the time resolved transport measurements in a high purity single crystal of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 ( @xmath21 ) to elucidate the marking of a limiting temperature @xmath22 far below the onset temperature of pe ( @xmath23 ) , below which ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) , fll is essentially dislocation free . above @xmath22 , a sharp change in the reordering timescales , observation of strong hysteresis , and the presence of a plastic response , reflects the proliferation of dislocations , which they surmise as a precursor of the pe transition to the disordered state . these results in turn imply that in the ( h , t ) phase - space between the onset of precursor effects and upto the spinodal line ( i.e. , between @xmath22 and @xmath16 lines ) , the manifestation of tendency to polycrystallinity in the vortex matter can be explored in a variety of vortex dynamics measurements .",
    "explorations by banerjee _",
    "et al _ @xcite and thakur _ et al _ @xcite in a variety of crystals of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 reveal an intimate connection between hysteretic effects ( i.e. , metastability / thermomagnetic response ) and effective pinning , such that an increase in quenched random disorder leads to surfacing of a smp anomaly prior to the pe phenomenon .",
    "the results of li _ et al _ @xcite have motivated us to explore a manifestation of the evolution in the reordering time scales when the notion of phase co - existence @xcite spans across the regions of smp and pe anomalies @xcite , and it can be bifurcated into two sub - parts , where ordered and disordered pockets dominate , respectively . in particular , in the sub - part between the onset positions of smp and pe , where the ordered pockets dominate , there is a possibility of further sub - division . while the increase in @xmath9 from the onset position of smp ( @xmath25 ) anomaly to its peak position ( @xmath7 ) can be termed as anomalous , the decrease in @xmath9 from @xmath7 to the onset position of pe ( @xmath26 ) is indeed non - anomalous @xcite .",
    "this permits a non - monotonic variation in the relative weights of ordered and disordered pockets in the phase co - existence regime between @xmath25 and @xmath8 .",
    "such a behavior could get reflected in the reordering time scales experienced during isothermal magnetization hysteresis experiments , where the magnetic field is steadily ramped as in a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) .    in field ramping experiments , disordered vortices enter a given sample through its edges / surface inhomogeneities @xcite and they attempt to reach towards an underlying equilibrium state in specific experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "we present here an analysis of the results of one such study performed using a vsm .",
    "we believe that new data are supportive of a claim @xcite that two distinct features ( viz . ,",
    "the smp and pe anomalies ) evident in the disordering of the weakly pinned fll represent two distinct phase transitions .",
    "the single crystals of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 used in this study are , ( i ) a nascent pinned sample @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) with @xmath29 and ( ii ) few somewhat more strongly pinned samples , viz . , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , having 200  ppm of fe as impurity and with @xmath34 .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio ( @xmath35 ) for the samples @xmath27 and @xmath32 were measured to be 20 and 9.8 , respectively .",

    "isothermal m - h loops were recorded on a 12  tesla vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) ( oxford instruments , uk ) , with field scan rates ( @xmath36 ) in the range of 100  oe / min to 8  koe / min .",
    "the ac susceptibility measurements were done utilizing an ac option facility on a commercial squid magnetometer ( quantum design inc .",
    ", u.s.a . , model mpms7 ) .",
    "1 ( a ) shows a portion of an isothermal m - h loop recorded at 3.86  k in crystal @xmath32 of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 , with the magnetic field having being ramped with @xmath37 of 3  koe / min . the pe and smp like anomaly have been identified , with the boxed region showing the latter , which sits deeper in the mixed state .",
    "the same figure also depicts magnetization values ( open triangles ) at different fields obtained in field cooled ( fc ) manner ( @xmath38 ) . in view of the tendancy",
    "that notion of pinning resists the expulsion of flux from the interior of the sample during field cooling process , the small angle neutron scattering experiments to probe the structure of the vortex matter at a given field are performed in the field cooled conditions @xcite . in a fc state ,",
    "the magnetization value can , therefore , be taken to represent a notional equilibrium magnetization value ( @xmath39 ) , with no gradient in macroscopic field in the bulk of the sample .",
    "the width of the magnetization hysteresis loop ( @xmath40 ) at a given field is usually considered to measure the critical current density @xmath14 @xcite . the hysteresis width is observed to depend on the scan rate @xmath37 of the field .",
    "the linear relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath14 is satisfactory when field fully penetrates the sample and its variation over the sample is not large . in the given crystal @xmath32 ,",
    "the full penetration field at 3.86  k in the field range of interest is less than 100  oe @xcite .",
    "we may , therefore , assume that in the field interval of interest ( 1  koe to 15  koe ) in the present experiment in sample @xmath32 at 3.86  k , the variation in the local macroscopic field across the sample is a very small fraction of the externally applied field .",
    "if we , therefore , assume that the applied field value ( notionally ) prevails across the sample , it will amount to a little quantitative inaccuracy .    in fig . 1 ( b )",
    ", we have shown the effect of @xmath37 on one - half of the hysteresis width , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and proportional to the critical current density , @xmath43 , during the forward leg of the envelope curve from 1  koe to 15  koe .",
    "these data suggest a substantially larger scan rate dependence of the @xmath43 values prior to the pe region .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath14 at any h decreases as ramp rate decreases .",
    "an instantaneous value of @xmath14 would correspond to the limit of an infinite scan rate , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "slower ramping of field permits larger settling time for injected disordered bundles of vortices to approach towards an underlying equilibrium state at a given @xmath45 . in order to elucidate the modulation in the field dependence of @xmath14 vs @xmath37 before and after the order - disorder transition(s ) as evidenced by smp and pe",
    ", we plotted @xmath46 vs @xmath47 at different values of @xmath45 . from every such plot ,",
    "we extracted by extrapolation a limiting magnetization value ( @xmath48 ) for an infinite scan rate ( @xmath49 ) . using these values , we show in the panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "2 the log - log plots of @xmath50 ( proportional to the normalized critical current density , @xmath51 ) versus @xmath47 at different field values , starting from deep within the mixed state , right upto the peak position of the pe at 3.86  k. from these data , it is evident ( see fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) that the temporal decay of the forward critical current density progressively increase as one proceeds from the low field end ( e.g. , 1.6  koe ) , till one approaches the onset field of the smp , @xmath25 ( @xmath52 ) . above that field",
    ", there is a relative decrease in the temporal decay , until the peak position of smp , @xmath7 ( @xmath53 ) is reached .",
    "2 ( b ) shows that from @xmath7 to the onset field for the pe , @xmath8 ( @xmath54 ) , there is again an increase in the temporal decay . beyond @xmath8 ,",
    "the temporal decay reduces monotonically upto the peak position of the pe , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "these observations , we believe , attest to the presence of multiple undulations in the reordering time scales of the injected disordered vortices .      in order to further comprehend the modulation in the temporal decays in @xmath51 ,",
    "we have used a parameter @xmath57 defined as @xmath58 , which we believe , represents the normalized decay rate of @xmath9 at larger times ( i.e. , very slow scan rate ) .",
    "the inset and main panels of fig .",
    "3 show behavior of @xmath59 at 3.86  k in the sample @xmath32 of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 .",
    "we indeed observe a non - monotonic variation in @xmath60 , until it reaches a limit near @xmath61 , which we reckon correspond to a value that such a parameter would assume for the usual thermal creep behavior @xcite in the pinned state .",
    "as stated earlier , the observed behavior can be rationalized on the premise that if the underlying equilibrium state at a given h is completely disordered , the injected disordered bundles of vortices would assume such a state instantaneously and , therefore , the time decay ( i.e. , scan rate dependence ) in hysteresis width ( @xmath62 ) would be governed by the process of thermal creep alone . however ,",
    "if the underlying equilibrium state is partially ordered , the injected vortices would require additional time lapse to conform to that state before the process of thermal creep starts governing the observed time decay .",
    "in an isothermal ramp , at low fields ( where fll lattice constant @xmath63 , the penetration depth ) , the injected diordered vortices could be expected to first conform to the reentrant disordered state @xcite , followed by ( gradual ) crossover to the progressively better ordered elastic glass phase @xcite upto the onset of the smp anomaly .",
    "thereafter , as the state of co - existence of weaker and stronger pinned phases commences @xcite , the injected disorder would attempt to heal towards the partially ordered equilibrium state , which can be attained in somewhat shorter time scales than that needed for @xmath64 .",
    "we believe that the modulation in @xmath60 in fig .",
    "3 essentially reflect the changes in the underlying equilibrium state from reentrant disordered phase to the peak position of pe .",
    "we are tempted to attribute the turnaround in @xmath60 response between @xmath7 and @xmath8 to the possibility of improvement in the state of partial order with increase in field in this interval @xcite . considering that the @xmath60 value at @xmath8 is about the same as that at @xmath25",
    ", we may naively state that the partially disordered phase nearly heals uptill the arrival of the pe regime .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the scan rate dependence of the ratios of the critical current density at the peak position to that at the onset position for the smp and pe anomalies , respectively obtained from the isothermal m - h data at 3.86  k. the increase in the values of the ratio with decrease in scan rate conforms to the notion that slower ramp rate permits attainment of superior spatial order prior to entry into the anomalous regimes . for the smp anomaly , the ratio changes from about 1.3 to about 2.5 , whereas for the pe , it changes from about 20 to about 90 .",
    "let us recall that in a collective pinning scenario due to larkin - ovchinnikov @xcite , @xmath9 relates inversely to the correlation volume , @xmath65 ( @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are radial and longitudinal correlation lengths ; for simplicity we may take @xmath69 ) . the above values then imply a reduction in radial correlation length ( @xmath67 ) by a factor of about 20 across the pe .",
    "et al _ @xcite had estimated @xmath70 ( where , @xmath71 is fll constant ) at @xmath72 to be @xmath7320 at 4.2  k in a crystal ( sample @xmath30 ) of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "a change in @xmath67 value by a factor of about 20 during complete amorphization of fll between the onset and peak positions of pe therefore appears satisfactory .",
    "when both smp and pe are present in a given isothermal scan , the collapse in correlation volume of vortex lattice could occur in two stages - a very large domain first sub - divides into multiple parts , followed by partial healing and ( eventual ) complete amorphization into micro - domains .    to establish the efficacy of prescription of analysis of scan rate dependence of hysteresis width as illustrated in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "we show for comparison in fig .",
    "5 the @xmath60 data at two temperatures in a weakly pinned crystal of another low @xmath10 superconductor , viz . , ca@xmath3rh@xmath4sn@xmath5 , in which smp and pe had been reported earlier @xcite . the smp anomaly in this compound is as prominent as the pe , the field region of smp , however , is insensitive to the temperature variation , whereas the pe closely follows the @xmath15 line .",
    "the separation between the smp anomaly and the pe , therefore , decreases as @xmath74 increases .",
    "it had also been suggested that in ca@xmath3rh@xmath4sn@xmath5 , the dislocations injected in between the onset and peak positions of smp could heal upto the onset position of the pe @xcite .",
    "it is useful to examine the @xmath60 behavior in ca@xmath3rh@xmath4sn@xmath5 at 1.9  k and 3.6  k ( cf .",
    "5 ( a ) and 5 ( b ) ) .",
    "while the non - monotonic behavior in @xmath60 is evident at both temperatures , the relative enhancement in @xmath60 values between @xmath25 and @xmath7 is more at 1.9  k as compared to that at 3.6  k. considering the larger field interval between @xmath25 and @xmath7 in ca@xmath3rh@xmath4sn@xmath5 as compared to the corresponding interval in @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 , the @xmath60 values decrease to a much deeper level in the former sample , and from which the turnaround also happens upto a lower limit , i.e. , @xmath75 value is smaller than @xmath76 value in ca@xmath3rh@xmath4sn@xmath5 .",
    "a comparative look at @xmath60 data in crystal @xmath32 of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 and that of ca@xmath3rh@xmath4sn@xmath5 conveys similarity in behavior across smp and pe anomalies ( cf .",
    "3 and fig .",
    "5 ) , however , the values of the @xmath57 parameter in the former case are much larger .",
    "the observation that smp anomaly in ca@xmath3rh@xmath4sn@xmath5 does not display temperature variation is supportive of the viewpoint that this anomaly is entirely pinning induced .",
    "a study of the variation of quenched random pinning on the pe phenomenon in a number of crystals of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 had independently revealed that smp anomaly in this system surfaces up with the enhancement of pinning .",
    "it is , therefore , instructive to compare the scan rate dependences of hysteresis width in crystals of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 , with varying pinning strengths . in a given crystal of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 , effective pinning can also be seen to enhance with the increase in field @xcite .",

    "these data correspond to a situation , where the smp anomaly partially overlaps with the pe anomaly ( broadening due to enhancement in effective disorder ) and one can barely mark the onset position @xmath8 of the pe . even in such a circumstance , one can see a marked difference in the dynamical response above the onset field of the pe anomaly and at field values below it .",

    ", the signature corresponding to the smp like anomaly becomes indiscernible , while it is distinctly observable at a larger scan rate of 8  koe / min .",
    "such an observation could lead to an apprehension whether any change occurs in the underlying vortex state across the field interval of @xmath25 and @xmath7 . in this context",

    "6(b ) shows a comparison of the forward legs of two m - h loops obtained with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively in crystal @xmath27 at 2  k. it is apparent that the hysteresis width across pe region shrinks rapidly with decrease in @xmath37 .",
    "attempts to obtain a hysteresis bubble in the m - h data across pe recorded using a squid magnetometer ( quantum design inc . u.s.a . ) , where data are recorded in a quasi - static manner ( after a time lapse of about a minute from the instance the magnet current is set in persistent mode ) did not yield affirmative output , as the hysteresis bubble had collapsed to the background limit in the elapsed time @xcite . non - observation of pe bubble in m - h data in very clean crystals of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 has been eluded to earlier @xcite , however , the changes ( amounting to a phase transition ) happening in the vortex state across the pe have been elucidated via stm imaging in the same crystal @xcite .",

    "the observations in fig .  6 and fig .",
    "7 prompt us to state that enhancement in pining in crystals of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 not only invokes the surfacing of smp , but , also slows down the time decay of macroscopic currents that get set up in response to a driving force in the pe region .",
    "one difference between smp and pe anomalies in ca@xmath3rh@xmath4sn@xmath5 and the sample @xmath32 of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 is that in the former both the features are well separated at lower temperatures ( higher fields ) , but in the latter sample , smp appears as a precursor part of pe , with the possibility of large overlap at lower temperatures . when smp and pe lie in closer proximity , the two together present themselves as a candidate @xcite of edge effects complicating the pe pertaining to order - disorder transition in the bulk of the sample in ac susceptibility measurements . in order to further explore the case of smp as a bulk feature and/or edge effects , we measured ac susceptibility in sample @xmath32 of @xmath0-nbse@xmath1 at different frequencies and amplitudes of ac field .",
