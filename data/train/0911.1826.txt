    "we call these _ arithmetic completely regular codes _ and propose their full classification , modulo the classification of perfect codes of hamming type",
    ". our results are strongest when the hamming graph admits a completely regular partition into such codes ( e.g. , the partition into cosets of some additive completely regular code ) , since it is known that the quotient graph obtained from any such partition is distance - regular . using leonard s theorem , the list of possible quotients is determined , with a few special cases left as open problems . in the case of linear arithmetic completely regular codes ,",
    "more can be said .",
    "the techniques employed are mainly combinatorial and products of codes as well as decompositions of codes into `` reduced '' codes play a fundamental role .",
    "the results have impact in algebraic coding theory , but more so in the theory of distance - regular graphs .",
    "since , for large minimum distance , the coset graph of any such linear code is a distance - regular graph locally isomorphic to a hamming graph , the analysis can be viewed as a special case of a fairly difficult open classification problem in the theory of distance - regular graphs .",
    "what is interesting here is how the combinatorics of the hamming graph gives leverage in the combinatorial analysis of its quotients , a tool not available in the unrestricted problem .",

    ", we will introduce the concept of _ leonard completely regular codes _ and we will develop the basic theory for them",
    ". we will also give several important families of leonard completely regular codes in the classical distance - regular graphs , demonstrating their fundamental role in structural questions about these graphs .",
    "we conjecture that all completely regular codes in the hamming graphs with large enough covering radius are in fact leonard .",
    "the class of arithmetic codes we introduce in this paper is perhaps the most important subclass of the leonard completely regular codes in the hamming graphs and something similar is likely true for the other classical families , but this investigation is left as an open problem .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "after an introductory section outlining the required background , we explore products of completely regular codes in hamming graphs . first noting ( prop .",
    "[ pcxccrimplesbothcr ] ) that a completely regular product must arise from completely regular constituents , we determine in proposition [ pprodcrc ] exactly when the product of two completely regular codes in two hamming graphs is completely regular . at this point , the role of the arithmetic property becomes clear and we present a generic form for the quotient matrix of such a code in lemma [ ltridiageigenvalues ] . with this preparatory material out of the way , we are then ready to present the main results in section [ subsec : classification ] . applying the celebrated theorem of leonard , theorem [ tarithmeticquo ]",
    "provides powerful limitations on the combinatorial structure of a quotient of a hamming graph when the underlying completely regular partition is composed of arithmetic codes .",
    "stronger results are obtained in proposition [ pcliques ] , theorem [ tbreakdown ] and proposition [ pnotdoob ] when one makes additional assumptions about the minimum distance of the codes or the specific structure of the quotient .",
    "when @xmath0 is a linear completely regular code with the arithmetic property and @xmath0 has minimum distance at least three and covering radius at most two , we show that @xmath0 is closely related to some hamming code .",
    "these results are summarized in theorem [ tproductrho=1 ] , which gives a full classification of possible codes and quotients in the linear case ( always assuming the arithmetic and completely regular properties ) and corollary [ chammingquo ] which characterizes hamming quotients of hamming graphs .",
