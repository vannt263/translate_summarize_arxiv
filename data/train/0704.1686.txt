    "cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite has as its central objective the realization of strong dipole coupling between a discrete transition in matter ( e.g. ,  an atom or quantum dot ) and a mode of an electromagnetic cavity .",
    "most often strong coupling is demonstrated through the realization of vacuum rabi splitting @xcite .",
    "first realized for rydberg atoms in superconducting microwave cavities @xcite and for transitions at optical wavelengths in high - finesse fabry perots @xcite , vacuum rabi splitting was recently observed in monolithic structures where the discrete transition is provided by a semiconductor quantum dot @xcite , and in a coupled system of qubit and resonant circuit engineered from superconducting electronics @xcite .",
    "more generally , vacuum rabi spectra can be observed for any pair of coupled harmonic oscillators @xcite without the need for strong coupling of the one - atom kind .",
    "prior to observations for single atoms and quantum dots , similar spectra were observed in many - atom @xcite and -exciton @xcite systems where the radiative coupling is collectively enhanced .",
    "the definitive signature of single - atom strong coupling is the large effect a single photon in the cavity has on the reflection , side - scattering , or transmission of another photon .",
    "strong coupling has a dramatic effect , for example , on the delayed photon coincidence rate in forwards scattering when a cavity qed system is coherently driven on axis @xcite .",
    "photon antibunching is seen at a level proportional to the parameter @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the atomic dipole coupling constant , @xmath2 is the atomic spontaneous emission rate , and @xmath3 is the photon loss rate from the cavity ; the collective parameter @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the number of atoms , does not enter into the magnitude of the effect when @xmath6 . in the one - atom case , and for @xmath7 , the size of the effect is raised to @xmath8 @xcite [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g2_ideal ] ) ] .",
    "the first demonstration of photon antibunching was made @xcite for moderately strong coupling ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ( effective ) atoms .",
    "the measurement has subsequently been repeated for somewhat higher values of @xmath13 and slightly fewer atoms @xcite , and a measurement for one trapped atom @xcite , in a slightly altered configuration , has demonstrated the so - called photon blockade effect @xcite  i.e . , the antibunching of forwards - scattered photons for coherent driving of a vacuum - rabi resonance , in which case a two - state approximation may be made @xcite , assuming the coupling is sufficiently strong .",
    "the early experiments of rempe _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and those of mielke _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and foster _",
    "@xcite employ systems designed around a fabry - perot cavity mode traversed by a thermal atomic beam .",
    "their theoretical modeling therefore presents a significant challenge , since for the numbers of _ effective _",
    "atoms used , the atomic beam carries hundreds of atoms  typically an order of magnitude larger than the effective number @xcite  into the interaction volume .",
    "the hilbert space required for exact calculations is enormous ( @xmath14 ) ; it grows and shrinks with the number of atoms , which inevitably fluctuates over time ; and the atoms move through a spatially varying cavity mode , so their coupling strengths are changing in time . ideally , all of these features should be taken into account , although certain approximations might be made .    for weak excitation , as in the experiments ,",
    "the lowest permissible truncation of the hilbert space  when calculating two - photon correlations  is at the two - quanta level . within a two - quanta truncation ,",
    "relatively simple formulas can be derived so long as the atomic motion is overlooked @xcite .",
    "it is even possible to account for the unequal coupling strengths of different atoms , and , through a monte - carlo average , fluctuations in their spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "a significant discrepancy between theory and experiment nevertheless remains : rempe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite describe how the amplitude of the rabi oscillation ( magnitude of the antibunching effect ) was scaled down by a factor of 4 and a slight shift of the theoretical curve was made in order to bring their data into agreement with this model ; the discrepancy persists in the experiments of foster _",
    "@xcite , except that the required adjustment is by a scale factor closer to 2 than to 4 .",
    "attempts to account for these discrepancies have been made but are unconvincing .",
    "martini and schenzle @xcite report good agreement with one of the data sets from ref .",
    "@xcite ; they numerically solve a many - atom master equation , but under the unreasonable assumption of stationary atoms and equal coupling strengths .",
    "the unlikely agreement results from using parameters that are very far from those of the experiment  most importantly , the dipole coupling constant is smaller by a factor of approximately 3 .",
    "foster _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report a rather good theoretical fit to one of their data sets .",
    "it is obtained by using the mentioned approximations and adding a detuning in the calculation to account for the doppler broadening of a misaligned atomic beam .",
    "they state that `` imperfect alignment @xmath15 can lead to a tilt from perpendicular of as much as @xmath16 '' .",
    "they suggest that the mean doppler shift is offset in the experiment by adjusting the driving laser frequency and account for the distribution about the mean in the model",
    ". there does appear to be a difficulty with this procedure , however , since while such an offset should work for a ring cavity , it is unlikely to do so in the presence of the counter - propagating fields of a fabry - perot .",
    "indeed , we are able to successfully simulate the procedure only for the ring - cavity case ( sec .  [",
    "sec : detuning ] ) .    the likely candidates to explain the disagreement between theory and experiment",
    "have always been evident .",
    "for example , rempe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite state :    *   `` apparently the transient nature of the atomic motion through the cavity mode ( which is not included here or in ref .",
    "[ 7 ] ) has a profound effect in decorrelating the otherwise coherent response of the sample to the escape of a photon . ''",
    "and also :    *   `` empirically , we also know that @xmath17 is reduced somewhat because the weak - field limit is not strictly satisfied in our measurements . ''",
    "to these two observations we should add  picking up on the comment in @xcite  that in a standing - wave cavity an atomic beam misalignment would make the decorrelation from atomic motion a great deal worse .    thus , the required improvements in the modeling are : ( i ) a serious accounting for atomic motion in a thermal atomic beam , allowing for up to a few hundred interacting atoms and a velocity component along the cavity axis , and ( ii ) extension of the hilbert space to include 3 , 4 , etc .",
    "quanta of excitation , thus extending the model beyond the weak - field limit .",
    "the first requirement is entirely achievable in a quantum trajectory simulation @xcite , while the second , even with recent improvements in computing power , remains a formidable challenge .    in this paper",
    "we offer an explanation of the discrepancies between theory and experiment in the measurements of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we perform _ ab initio _ quantum trajectory simulations in parallel with a monte - carlo simulation of a tilted atomic beam .",
    "the parameters used are listed in table [ tab : parameters ] : set 1 corresponds to the data displayed in fig .",
    "4(a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , and set 2 to the data displayed in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "all parameters are measured quantities or are inferred from measured quantities  and the atomic beam tilt alone is varied to optimize the data fit .",
    "excellent agreement is demonstrated for atomic beam misalignments of approximately @xmath18 ( a little over @xmath19 ) .",
    "these simulations are performed using a two - quanta truncation of the hilbert space .",
    "simulations based upon a three - quanta truncation are also carried out , which , although not adequate for the experimental conditions , can begin to address physics beyond the weak - field limit . from these ,",
    "an inconsistency with the intracavity photon number reported by foster _",
    "@xcite is found .    .",
    "parameters used in the simulations .",

    "@xcite and set 2 from ref .",
    "@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -0.5 cm    results for the experiment of foster _ et al _ @xcite lead in a rather different direction .",
    "they are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13](b ) , where four different intracavity photon numbers are considered .",
    "the lowest , @xmath20 , reproduces the weak - field result of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10](b ) . as the photon number",
    "is increased , the fit becomes progressively worse . even at the very low value of @xmath21 intracavity photons ,",
    "spontaneous emission raises the correlation function for zero delay by a noticeable amount",
    ". then we obtain @xmath22 at the largest photon number considered .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , even this photon number , @xmath23 , is smaller than that estimated for the experiment ",
    "smaller by a factor of five .",
    "our simulations therefore disagree significantly with the measurements , despite the near perfect fit of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10](b ) .",
    "the simplest resolution would be for the estimated photon number to be too high .",
    "a reduction by more than an order of magnitude is needed , however , implying an unlikely error , considering the relatively straightforward method of inference from photon counting rates .",
    "this anomaly , for the present , remains unresolved .",
    "spatial variation of the dipole coupling strength has for many years been a particular difficulty for cavity qed at optical frequencies .",
    "the small spatial scale set by the optical wavelength makes any approach to a resolution a formidable challenge .",
    "there has nevertheless been progress made with cooled and trapped atoms @xcite , and in semiconductor systems @xcite where the participating ` atoms ' are fixed .",
    "the earliest demonstrations of strong coupling at optical frequencies employed standing - wave cavities and thermal atomic beams , where control over spatial degrees of freedom is limited to the alignment of the atomic beam . of particular note are the measurements of photon antibunching in forwards scattering @xcite .",
    "they provide a definitive demonstration of strong coupling at the one - atom level ; although many atoms might couple to the cavity mode at any time , a significant photon antibunching effect occurs only when individual atoms are strongly coupled .",
    "spatial effects pose difficulties of a theoretical nature as well .",
    "models that ignore them can point the direction for experiments , but fail , ultimately , to account for experimental results . in this paper",
    "we have addressed a long - standing disagreement of this kind ",
    "disagreement between the theory of photon antibunching in forwards scattering for stationary atoms in a cavity @xcite and the aforementioned experiments @xcite .",
    "_ ab initio _ quantum trajectory simulations of the experiments have been carried out , including a monte - carlo simulation of the atomic beam .",
    "importantly , we allow for a misalignment of the atomic beam , since this was recognized as a critical issue in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that atomic beam misalignment is , indeed , the most likely reason for the degradation of the measured photon antibunching effect from predicted results . working first with a two - quanta truncation , suitable for the weak - field limit , data sets measured by rempe _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and foster _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite were fitted best by atomic beam tilts from perpendicular to the cavity axis of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "atomic motion is recognized as a source of decorrelation omitted from the model used to fit the measurements in ref .",
    "we found that the mechanism is more complex than suggested there , however .",
    "an atomic beam tilt of sufficient size results in a nonadiabatic response of the intracavity photon number to the inevitable density fluctuations of the beam .",
    "thus classical noise is written onto the forwards - scattered photon flux , obscuring the antibunched quantum fluctuations .",
    "the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite are particularly unfortunate in this regard , since the nonadiabatic response excites a _ bunched _ vacuum rabi oscillation , which all but cancels out the antibunched oscillation one aims to measure .",
    "although both of the experiments modeled operate at relatively low forwards scattering rates , neither is strictly in the weak - field limit .",
    "we have therefore extended our simulations ",
    "subject to some numerical constraints  to assess the effects of spontaneous emission .",
    "the fit to the rempe _",
    "_ data  @xcite was slightly improved .",
    "we noted that the optimum fit might plausibly be obtained by adopting a marginally smaller atomic beam tilt and allowing for greater decorrelation from spontaneous emission , though a more efficient numerical method would be required to verify this possibility .",
    "the fit to the foster _",
    "data  @xcite was highly sensitive to spontaneous emission . even for an intracavity photon number five times smaller than the estimate for the experiment , a large disagreement with the measurement appeared .",
    "no explanation of the anomaly has been found .",
    "we have shown that cavity qed experiments can call for elaborate and numerically intensive modeling before a full understanding , at the quantitative level , is reached . using quantum trajectory methods , we have significantly increased the scope for realistic modeling of cavity qed with atomic beams .",
    "while we have shown that atomic beam misalignment has significantly degraded the measurements in an important set of experiments in the field , this observation leads equally to a positive conclusion : potentially , nonclassical photon correlations in cavity qed can be observed at a level at least ten times higher than so far achieved .",
