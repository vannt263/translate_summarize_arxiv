    "charmonium and bottomonium are important objects in studying strong interactions and structures of hadrons . in the past decade , many new hadron states with heavy flavors , such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and etc .",
    ", have been found in the @xmath13 annihilation and the @xmath14 meson decay experiments by @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite , in particular , @xmath17 has been observed in the @xmath13 annihilation by @xmath18 and @xmath16@xcite recently .",
    "these new findings have attracted much attention on the structure of hadron all over the particle and nuclear physics societies @xcite .",
    "however , some of the states can not be identified as a conventional quarkonium with heavy flavor , such as the charmonium or its excited state because of their abnormal quantum numbers , masses , decay modes and corresponding branching ratios in experiments .",
    "therefore , as mentioned in our previous paper @xcite , to explain the peculiar data , many postulates for their structures have been proposed , but up to now , no definite conclusions could be drawn yet .",
    "one of the striking pictures among the postulates is the baryonium with heavy flavor . in the extended heavy baryonium picture used in our previous paper @xcite , an approximate su(2 ) symmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath19",
    "is assumed , and @xmath0 and @xmath19 are taken as the basis vectors in the two - dimensional `` c - spin '' representation , which is analogues to the isospin in the nucleon doublet case .",
    "apparently , these basis vectors can form a `` c - spin '' triplet and a `` c - spin '' singlet @xcite .",
    "the key point is to verify if a heavy baryon and a heavy antibaryon can really form a bound state , the baryonium , dynamically .",
    "the simplest way to achieve this aim is extracting a potential between heavy baryons by using a theory , for instance the so - called heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbcpt ) which can effectively provide a good description for the heavy baryon , and then solving the schrdinger equation for the energy eigenvalue and consequently the mass spectrum .",
    "in fact , in our previous investigation @xcite we have studied the possibility of forming a heavy baryonium by using hbcpt .",
    "the result showed that there might exist a heavy baryonium as long as the adopted values of the coupling constant at the baryon - goldstone - boson vertex and the cutoff parameter @xmath20 are , respectively , in the special ranges , although the result is very sensitive to such values .",
    "apparently , the strong parameter dependence is undesirable .",
    "such a dependence might come from the inappropriate approximation in deriving potentials , for instance the premature truncation to the term with @xmath21 in the asymptotic expressions of the potentials expanded in @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this is because that the contribution from the two - pion - exchange potential is short ranged , but the expansion of the potential function in @xmath22 requires a relatively larger @xmath23 .",
    "although the dominant contribution of the @xmath22 integral comes from small @xmath22 values , the expansion converges extremely slow .",
    "moreover , whether the physical value of the coupling constant , which can be extracted from relevant decay data , supports the existence of a heavy baryonium is still questionable and this problem should further be investigated carefully .    in this paper",
    ", we first re - derive the potential between @xmath24 and @xmath25 in a holonomic form rather than a truncated expansion in ref.@xcite .",
    "then , we study the @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) scattering to get scattering characters , in particular those closely related to its binding feature . based on the enlightenment from scattering information ,",
    "we finally calculate the binding behavior of the system to confirm whether a heavy baryonium really exists . the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the formalism of hbcpt is briefly recalled .",
    "the two body interaction potentials in the @xmath28-@xmath29 and @xmath30-@xmath31 systems are given in section 3 .",
    "in section 4 , the numerical results for the scattering information and the mass spectra of possible heavy baryonia are presented . and",
    "the summary is given in section 5 .",
    "as commonly adopted , symbol @xmath32 , where @xmath33 represents the light quark , and @xmath34 denotes the heavy quark , describes a heavy baryon which contains one heavy quark and two light quarks .",
    "assuming that two light quarks form a pair of diquark , then in the flavor space , these three quarks can form a symmetric sextet and an antisymmetric triplet , i.e. @xmath35 . because the wave function of the hadron in the color space is totally antisymmetric , the wave function in the direct product space of orbit , flavor and spin must be symmetric . consequently , for a ground state hadron , the wave function in the flavor and spin spaces should be symmetric since the orbital wave function is symmetric . for the light quark pair , we use young table @xmath36 and @xmath37 to denote the symmetric sextet and antisymmetric triplet in the flavor space , respectively , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 to represent the triplet and singlet in the spin space , respectively . coupling these wave functions of a diquark to that of a heavy quark , denoted by @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 \\times \\left(\\yvcentermath1\\young(q)^f\\times \\yvcentermath1\\young(q)^s\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\yvcentermath1\\young(12)^f_{q_1,q_2 } \\times \\yvcentermath1\\young(q)^f\\times \\left(\\yvcentermath1\\young(12q)^s_{q_1,q_2,q } \\oplus \\yvcentermath1\\young(12,q)^s_{q_1,q_2,q}\\right ) \\oplus \\left(\\yvcentermath1\\young(1,2)^f_{q_1,q_2 } \\times \\yvcentermath1\\young(q)^f \\times \\yvcentermath1\\young(q)^s\\right).\\label{fs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ fs ] ) suggests that the sextet @xmath42 has spin-@xmath43 and spin-@xmath44 states , while the triplet @xmath45 has only spin-@xmath43 states .",
    "writing them explicitly in the matrix form , we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the sextet and triplet of the charmed heavy baryon , respectively , and the same form of eq.([b6 ] ) for the spin-@xmath44 @xmath48 multiple .",
    "these forms are also applicable to the bottomed heavy baryon multiple by substituting @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "on the other hand , in terms of the chiral perturbation theory , one has the leading order vector and axial vector fields in @xmath51 @xcite @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the goldstone boson matrix m = (    ccc ^0 + & ^+ & k^+ + ^- & - ^0 + & k^0 + k^- & |k^0 & -    ) .",

    ", we see that the longest range of the obtained potentials is , as expected , that of the two - pion - exchange , because they have a quadratic product of @xmath99 ( or derivatives ) , and thus have their longest range terms proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "in addition , we would point out that because the kernels in different channel are the same except the coefficients , for simplicity , we can derive the kernel itself first , and then add the coefficient later for the particular system .",

    "in the numerical calculation , we take @xmath148gev and @xmath149gev .",
    "we also choose the cutoff parameter @xmath150 gev , because in the chiral perturbation theory , the momentum transfer is usually less than @xmath151gev .    in the @xmath152-@xmath153 system ,",

    ", we see that comparing with our previous result @xcite , no matter in which states , the singular behavior of the potential around origin is greatly reduced .",
    "this indicates that the contribution from large @xmath22 values is also important in the two - pion exchange process .",
    "moreover , the potentials become more attractive with increasing values of @xmath4 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is reasonable , because the larger @xmath4 value provides stronger coupling and consequently stronger potential .",
    "and the value of the cut - off @xmath20 largely affects the depth of the potential , the smaller value of @xmath20 makes the shorter distance interaction even more suppressed .",
    "it partly prevents the @xmath0 and @xmath1 getting too close , thus matches our treatment of omitting the @xmath155-channel interaction .",
    "the line shape of these potentials also tells us that the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is attractive and might bind these particles together .    with these potentials",
    ", we can study the @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering property .",

    "then , the scattering phase shift @xmath163 and the potential @xmath164 has the relation @xmath165 solving above equations numerically , we obtain scattering phase shifts and plot them in fig.[phase1 ] .    from this figure , one sees that although all the potentials are attractive , in some cases , the potential does not support a binding character , especially in the case where the value of @xmath4 is extracted from the @xmath166 decay data ( the thick solid curve ) .",
    "it means that the @xmath63 could be bound ( the dashed curve ) only when the coupling constant @xmath4 takes a value larger than that from the data fitting , and the cut - off @xmath20 is larger than that in the light baryon sector .",
    "moreover , we can also calculate the scattering length for concerned states by @xmath167 the results are tabulated in table [ scatteringlength ] .    .scattering length for the spin - singlet and spin - triplet states in the @xmath0-@xmath168 and @xmath2-@xmath169systems . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tblambdab ]    the result shows that for the @xmath6-@xmath7 system , a relatively smaller @xmath170 value can make the spin - triplet state bound .",

    "however , the final conclusion should not be made before some issues are clarified , like , whether or not the @xmath178-@xmath103-@xmath6 coupling can be straightforwardly applied to the loop calculation . when future decay data of the @xmath50-flavored baryon become available",
    ", we would be able to extract a physical value of @xmath170 .",

    "unlike our previous work , we use the holonomic potential to investigate the scattering and binding characters in this paper .",
    "the scattering characters of these systems are calculated by solving the partial schrdinger equation . from the obtained phase shifts and the scattering lengths , it is found that the @xmath0-@xmath1 system could be bound with a @xmath4 value larger than that extracted phenomenologically from the decay data of charmed baryons or estimated by ref.@xcite . for the @xmath2-@xmath3 system , since we do not have available decay data to fix @xmath60 , whether the system is bound depends on the selected value of @xmath60 .",
    "to confirm these results , the bound state calculations are further performed .",

    "it should be mentioned that above conclusions are also related the cutoff value which is assumed to be similar to that for the light hadron sector in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "a similar situation was met in ref.@xcite , where a relative large cutoff is also required for a possible molecule state in the @xmath0-@xmath0 system in the one - pion - exchange model .",
    "furthermore , it is worthwhile to emphasize that in order to more realistically affirm whether the heavy - baryon - anti - heavy - baryon system could have a bound state , namely a heavy baryonium , the annihilation channel and couple channel effects on the heavy baryonium potential should also be taken into account . in particular",
