    "neutrino oscillations are a well - stablished phenomenon , with parameters that have been measured with great accuracy  @xcite , except for the cp - violating phase which is expected to be precisely determined in the new generation of long - baseline neutrino experiments . despite this success ,",
    "all the analysis has been done in a particular parametrization  @xcite . in the case of neutrino physics , there are other parametrizations that could be interesting  @xcite , taking into account the possibility of accounting for more neutrino families as well as the richness of the possible neutrino majorana nature . moreover , for a unitarity test  @xcite , it may be more interesting to analyze the experimental data in a parameter - independent way , studying the values of the matrix entrances .",
    "it is already known that , for three families of dirac fermions , the mixing matrix will have four independent elements  @xcite . if neutrinos have majorana a nature , or if there are more neutrino families , the situation will be more complex  @xcite , but a test of the `` standard '' picture through unitarity can be considered as a first step into the search for new physics . on the other hand ,",
    "an important part of neutrino data comes from matter effects  @xcite , making the analysis more complicated due to the need for computing numerical solutions to the neutrino evolution equation , for the case of varying density profiles , or for using approximate formulas for neutrino probabilities in constant density environments  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we first discuss the exact formula for neutrino oscillations in a constant density environment .",
    "we show our results in terms of the entrances of the leptonic mixing matrix and , therefore , they are independent of the parametrization . afterwards , we introduce a new approximation that , besides being simple , can be formulated in terms of a series expansions and , therefore , can be computed with a level of accuracy according to the phenomenological needs of the given problem .",
    "the expressions found here could be useful in analyzing the neutrino data either in the standard parametrization or in other contexts , such as unitary test in the neutrino sector .",
    "the leptonic mixing matrix relates the mass and flavor states through the relation @xmath0 , where the matrix @xmath1 could be parametrized , for instance , in the usual convention adopted by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite .",
    "the evolution equation in vacuum will be given by @xmath2 that leads , through a well - known procedure , to the usual expression for neutrino probabilities in vacuum @xmath3 \\sin^2\\left ( \\frac{\\delta m^2_{\\ell j}l}{4e}\\right ) & \\nonumber \\\\   + 2\\displaystyle\\sum^{n}_{\\ell > j } { \\operatorname{im}}\\left [ u_{\\alpha \\ell}^{*}u_{\\beta \\ell}u_{\\alpha j}u_{\\beta j}^ { * } \\right ] \\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\delta m^2_{\\ell j}l}{2e}\\right).&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice however , that in the case when the extra neutrino states are heavy , they do not participate in the oscillation and the sum is cut up to three : @xmath4 \\sin^2\\left ( \\frac{\\delta m^2_{\\ell j}l}{4e}\\right ) & \\nonumber \\\\   + 2\\displaystyle\\sum^{3}_{\\ell > j } { \\operatorname{im}}\\left [ u_{\\alpha \\ell}^{*}u_{\\beta \\ell}u_{\\alpha j}u_{\\beta j}^ { * } \\right ] \\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\delta m^2_{\\ell j}l}{2e}\\right),&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the @xmath5 appearing in eq .",

    "if we would like to consider matter effects , we need to add the charged current potential due to electrons that , again in the mass basis : @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "it is known that in this case we can express the probability in a similar form @xmath8 \\sin^2\\left ( \\frac{\\delta m^2_{\\ell j}l}{4e}\\right ) & \\nonumber \\\\   + 2\\displaystyle\\sum^{n}_{\\ell > j } { \\operatorname{im}}\\left [ v_{\\alpha \\ell}^{*}v_{\\beta \\ell}v_{\\alpha j}v_{\\beta j}^ { * } \\right ] \\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\delta m^2_{\\ell j}l}{2e}\\right).&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by defining @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an unitary matrix .",

    ", we follow the procedure described in ref .",
    "we will arrive to the same expressions , except that we maintain the matrix elements of @xmath13 in a parameter - independent form .",
    "although the following procedure is straightforward , it will will allow to see the nonunitary case in a more transparent way .",
    "even if we work in the standard parametrization , the expression will be useful , as the numerical computations will be slightly simplified by substituting the parametrization at the end .",
    "we start by noticing that the term inside the parenthesis in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ 2.8 ] ) defines a matrix @xmath14 with a characteristic polynomial given by @xmath15- \\dfrac{1}{8e^3}{\\delta m^2_{21}}{\\delta m^2_{31}}a|u_{e1}|^2=0&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have subtracted a term @xmath16 from the main diagonal in order to simplify the equation .",

    "we can find the oscillation probabilities in matter as a function of the elements of the vacuum rotation matrix , without the use of any parameterization and without using the unitary relation .",
    "therefore , they could be useful to study the unitarity of the mixing matrix , a topic that could be of interest now that we are entering into a precision era in neutrino physics .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this method is well known  @xcite , although the treatment had been done in a specific parametrization .",
    "once we have discussed the exact solution for the constant density matter case , we proceed to find an approximate formula for the probabilities . in order to preserve the parametrization - free structure ,",
    "we look for an approximation for the cubic roots @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : roots ] ) .",
    "we start by noticing , from eq .",
    "( [ 2.12 ] ) , that if @xmath36 , then @xmath37 and the cubic equation ( [ eq : polynomial ] ) is reduced the quadratic case . if this is the case , eq .  ( [ 2.13 ] ) will reduce to the two typical solutions for a quadratic equation plus a third solution , given by @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , we will have the expression for @xmath39 : @xmath40 .\\ ] ] in this simple case it is easy to find that @xmath41 now we can consider that @xmath42 is not zero , but it is `` small '' , say @xmath43 .",
    "this seems a natural hypothesis since @xmath44 .",
    "we can try to find the correction @xmath45 that fulfills both @xmath46 and @xmath47 if we work only up to first - order terms , below @xmath48 , it is easy to find that @xmath49 fits both conditions .",

    "( [ eq : firstorder ] ) , we have @xmath53 we can go one step further and find the expression for @xmath45 at second order in @xmath52 .",
    "in this case we propose that @xmath54 and demand that eq .",
    "( [ eq : polynomialepsilon ] ) reduces to the usual cubic expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq : polynomial ] ) , up to second - order terms .",
    "this condition is fulfilled when @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , at second - order we have @xmath56 we can continue with this procedure and find recursively the coefficients @xmath57 for any order of approximation that we would like to have .",

    "although we have worked out all the computation in a formulation that is independent of the parametrization , we adopt now the standard pdg  @xcite parametrization in order to substitute the current values for the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "therefore , in this case , we explicitly adopt the unitary condition by making the following substitutions in eq .",
