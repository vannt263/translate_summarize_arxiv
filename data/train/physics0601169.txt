    "no one doubt that twentieth century is the century of quantum theory [ 1 - 13 ] .",
    "after 100 years of development quantum physics is no longer just a field , it is the bedrock of all of modern physics . although the modern quantum theory has provided a beautiful and consistent theory for describing the myriad baffling microphenomena which had previously defied explanation @xcite , one should not neglect a curious fact that quantum mechanics never take into account the deep structures of atoms .",
    "in fact , at the heart of quantum mechanics lies only the schrdinger equation @xcite , which is the fundamental equation governing the electron . according to quantum theory , it is the electromagnetic interaction ( by the exchange of photons ) which hold electrons and nuclei together in the atoms .",
    "but , up to now , quantum theory never provides a practical scheme that electron and nuclei can absorb and emit photons .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the energy relationship of electron in the hydrogen atom .",
    "significantly , we find a process of perfect transformation of two forms of energy ( kinetic and field energy ) inside the atom and the conservation of energy in the system . by applying the principle of wave - particle duality and comparing to known results of the macroscopic harmonic @xmath1 oscillator and microscopic photon",
    ", we are assured that electron kinetic energy in fact is a kind of magnetic energy and the atom is a natural microscopic @xmath1 oscillator . moreover , the mixed mechanism ( classical @xmath1 circuits / quantum wave - particle duality ) turns out to have remarkably rich and physical properties which can used to describe some important quantum principles and phenomena , for instance , polarization of photon , zeeman effect , selection rules , the electron s mass and spin , zero point energy ( zpe ) , the pauli exclusion principle and the dirac s magnetic monopole .",
    "classically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the hydrogen atom consists of one electron in orbit around one proton with the electron being held in place via the electric coulomb force .",
    "equation of motion is @xmath8where @xmath9 is mass of electron .",
    ". [ motion ] can be rewritten in the form of kinetic energy @xmath10 and field energy @xmath11 ( stored in the capacitor of hydrogen atom ) as follows : @xmath12where @xmath13 is the capacitance of the hydrogen system .",
    "thus the total energy of the hydrogen system is given by@xmath14    it should be pointed out that eq .",
    "[ energy1 ] and [ energy2 ] are the foundation of our study .",
    "these two equations together indicate a process of perfect periodically transformation of two forms of energy ( kinetic energy @xmath15 and field energy @xmath16 ) inside the atom and the conservation of energy in the system @xmath17    recall the macroscopic harmonic @xmath1 oscillator where two forms of energy , the maximum field energy @xmath18 of the capacitor @xmath19 ( carrying a charge @xmath20 ) and the maximum magnetic energy @xmath21 of the inductor @xmath22 , are mutually exactly interconvertible ( @xmath23 with a exchange periodic @xmath24 . and for a microscopic photon ( electromagnetic wave ) , the maximum field energy @xmath25 and the maximum magnetic energy @xmath26 also satisfy @xmath27 .    based on the above energy relationship for three totally different systems and the requirement of the electromagnetic interaction ( by exchanging photon ) between electron and nuclei",
    ", we assure that the kinetic energy of electron ( eq . [ energy1 ] ) is a kind of magnetic energy and the hydrogen atom is a natural microscopic @xmath1 oscillator . in 2000 , a multinational team of physicists had observed for the first time a process of internal conversion between bound atomic states when the binding energy of the converted electron becomes larger than the nuclear transition energy carreyre , kishimoto .",
    "this observation indicate that energy can pass resonantly between the nuclear and electronic parts of the atom by a resonant process similar to that which operates between an inductor and a capacitor in an @xmath1 circuit .",
    "these experimental results can be considered a conclusive evidence of reliability of our @xmath1 mechanism .    here",
    "raise an important question : how can the electron function as an excellent microscopic inductor ?",
    "we think the answer lies in the intrinsic wave - particle duality nature of electron . in our opinion ,",
    "the wave - particle nature @xcite of electron is only a macroscopic behavior of the intrinsic helical motion of electron within its world .",
    "in 1923 , broglie suggested that all particles , not just photons , have both wave and particle properties @xcite .",
    "the momentum wavelength relationship for any material particles was given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is called de broglie wavelength , @xmath30 is planck s constant @xcite and @xmath31 the momentum of the particle .",
    "the subsequent experiments established the wave nature of the electron davisson , thomson .",
    "eq.[broglie ] implies that , for a particle moving at high speed , the momentum is large and the wavelength is small . in other words ,",
    "the faster a particle moves , the shorter is its wavelength .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that any confinement of the studied particle will shorten the @xmath29 and help to enhance the so - called quantum confinement effects .    as shown in fig . [ fig2](a ) and ( b ) , based on eq .",
    "[ broglie ] and the demanding that the electron would be a microscopic inductor , we propose that a free electron can move along a helical orbit ( the helical pitch is de broglie wavelength @xmath32 of left - handed or right - handed . in this paper , the corresponding electrons are called left - hand  and right - hand  electron which are denoted by chirality indexes @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively . hence , the electron can now be considered as a periodic - motion quantized inductive particle which is called inducton  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the particle - like kinetic energy of electron can be replaced with a dual magnetic energy carried by a inducton .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath35where @xmath36 is the axial velocity of the helical moving electron and @xmath37 is the inductance of the quantized inducton .",
    "the above relation indicates that the mass of electron is associated with an amount of magnetic energy .    from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the electric current , for one de broglie wavelength , is given by @xmath38from eq .",
    "[ current ] , it is important to note that the electric current should be defined within an integral number of de broglie wavelength .",
    "hence , the electric current @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the electronic orbital radius in the hydrogen atom ) , which was widely used in the semiclassical bohr model , may be physically invalid . collecting eq .",
    "energy0 and [ current ] together , we have the inductance of single inducton    @xmath41    then the dual nature of electron can be uniquely determined by @xmath42 the periodic @xmath43 ( or frequency @xmath44 , the initial phase @xmath45 and the chirality ( @xmath33 or @xmath46 ) .",
    "by the application of helical electron orbit to the hydrogen atom ( fig .",
    "fig2 ) , we can not only explain the stability of the atom but also give a theoretical interpretation of the atomic spectra .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows four possible kinds of stable helical electron orbits in hydrogen atom , and each subgraph corresponds to a electron of different motion manner within the atom .",
    "the electrons can be distinguished by the following two aspects .",
    "first consider the chirality of electron orbits , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the electrons of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( c ) are left - hand  labelled by @xmath33 , while electrons of fig . [ fig3](b ) and ( d ) are right - hand  labelled by @xmath46 .",
    "secondly consider the direction of electron orbital magnetic moment @xmath47 , fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( b ) show that the @xmath47 are in the @xmath48 direction ( up ) while ( c ) and ( d ) in the @xmath49 direction ( down ) , the corresponding electrons are labelled by @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , here @xmath52 is called magnetic index .",
    "hence , the electrons of different physical properties become distinguishable , they are up left - hand  ( ulh ) electron ( @xmath50 , @xmath33 ) , up right - hand  ( urh ) electron ( @xmath53 , @xmath46 ) , down left - hand  ( dlh ) electron ( @xmath54 , @xmath33 ) and down right - hand  ( drh ) electron ( @xmath54 , @xmath46 ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the helical moving electron around the orbit mean radius @xmath40 can now be regarded as a quantized inducton  of @xmath55 thus the hydrogen atom is a natural microscopic @xmath1 oscillator .",
    "we consider that the physical properties of the hydrogen atom can be uniquely determined by these natural @xmath56 parameters . to prove that our theory is valid in explaining the structure of atomic spectra , we study the quantized orbit radius and the quantized energy of hydrogen atom and make a comparison between our results of @xmath1 mechanism and the known results of quantum theory .",
    "for the system of @xmath57 , the @xmath1 parameters of the hydrogen atom is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . then the @xmath1 resonant frequency is    @xmath58    recall the well - known relationship @xmath59 we have @xmath60combining eq . [ frequency ] and eq .",
    "[ energy3 ] gives @xmath61then the stable electron orbits are determined by @xmath62where @xmath63 is called principal oscillator number .",
    "the integer @xmath63 shows that the orbital allow integer number of induction  of the de broglie wavelength @xmath64 . from eq .",
    "[ wavelength ] and eq .",
    "[ stable ] , the quantized electron orbit mean radius is given by    @xmath65    where @xmath5 is the bohr radius . and",
    "the quantized energy is    @xmath66    where @xmath6 is the rydberg constant .",
    "surprisingly , the results of eq . radius and [ energy5 ] are in excellent agreement with bohr model bohr . besides , taking fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] into account , we can conclude that the quantized energies of eq .",
    "[ energy5 ] are quadruple degenerate .",
    "now , in the framework of helical electron orbit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the electron orbital magnetic moment @xmath47 is allowed naturally to be both positive ( @xmath50 ) and negative ( @xmath54 ) , therefore , the double splitting experiment @xcite is a immediate result of our theory .",
    "it seems that the electron spin @xcite no long as an essential quantum number in our studies . in section [ discus ] , we will try to explain for the first time the connection between the electron spin and the intrinsic helical movement of electron .",
    "furthermore , take a look at fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the other two inductons  with different de broglie wavelengths @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are defined . here",
    "we should stress that @xmath57 in fact is invalid in a system of circular motion . to illustrate this ideas ,",
    "let us examine the three situations ( @xmath69 , @xmath57 and @xmath68 ) carefully .",
    "for the case of @xmath55 both ends of the inducton  does nt fall in the @xmath70 plane and electron travelling through these two locations has a nonzero radial velocity , in this case we think the quantized inducton  defined by @xmath57 is unstable thus invalid in the system .",
    "but , for the other two cases of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , both ends of these inductons  fall in the @xmath70 plane , at the same time the corresponding radial velocity of the travelling electrons is zero , in other words , these two inductions  described by @xmath68 and @xmath67 are stable and can function as the inductions  of the studied system . hence for a given quantized electron orbit mean radius of eq . [ radius ] , the microscopic atom can contribute two natural @xmath1 oscillators ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 of fig . [ fig3](a ) ) . in our opinion , it is these two oscillators  of @xmath68 and @xmath67 that finally lead to the lamb shift @xcite and the bohr theory of hydrogen electron orbits ( @xmath73 are merely a approximate treatment of the corresponding helical electronic orbits .    the polarization of photon perhaps still is the greatest mystery in the microscopic world .",
    "when we reduce the light intensity to its smallest possible level , then we are dealing with one single photon @xmath74 the quantized light .",
    "now a great number of the quantized light test experiments have show that , in reality , the intrinsic polarization of photon is purely circular : either right or left circular polarization .",
    "quantum mechanics predicts that the polarization  is related to the electronic spin .",
    "nevertheless , this mystical explanation is somewhere far beyond the reality of the physical world .",
    "we state that the polarization of quantized photon is referred to the intrinsic helical movement of electron in the atom ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "namely , the left - hand electron ( @xmath33 ) will emit only left circular polarized photon , while right - hand electron ( @xmath46 ) will emit right circular polarized photon .      in quantum theory , four quantum numbers ( the principal quantum number @xmath63 , the angular momentum quantum number @xmath75 , the magnetic quantum number @xmath76 and the spin quantum number @xmath77 form a complete set used to specify the full quantum state of any system in quantum mechanics .",
    "to verify that our @xmath1 mechanism is designed to completely replace the quantum mechanism , a similar perfect set of indexes ( or quantum numbers ) must be physically defined .",
    "recall the above discussions , three indexes ( the chirality index @xmath78 , the magnetic index @xmath52 and the principal oscillator number @xmath63 ) have been introduced .",
    "our three indexes ( or quantum numbers ) are not a complete set @xmath74 that is , they are insufficient to fully specify the quantum state of the atom .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in physics , the mass of the electron is associated with the maximum and most complicated physical phenomena .",
    "though we are much better prepared today with copious amounts of definitions of the electron mass , for example , the inertia and gravitational mass in newtonian mechanics , relativistic mass in einstein theory , effective mass in semiconductor physics , electromagnetic mass in electromagnetic theory and heavy fermion in condensed matter physics .",
    "we think that a deeper physical understanding of this concept ( mass ) is still not available in known physics .",
    "it seems difficult to understand what is the mass of the electron and why the value of the electron mass is not the intrinsic physical quantity .    in 1905 , einstein presented his famous formula , @xmath79 , known as the energy - mass relation . in this paper",
    ", we have found another energy - mass relation for the special particle of electron .",
    "let us recall eq .",
    "energy0 , what it says is that the mass of electron is associated with an amount of magnetic energy .",
    "the most important conclusion related to our energy - mass relation is , that a stronger quantum confinement of electron ( reducing the wavelength @xmath80 ) will directly result in the increment of the mass of the electron .",
    "here we assume all known concepts of electron mass would have the same physical reason . in order to have a deeper understanding of the electron mass ,",
    "we construct a table and make a comparison between the electron mass of the less confinement systems and that of the more confinement ones .    from table .",
    "[ table2 ] one can see that all relationships presented are in agreement with the known theoretical and experimental results .",
    "therefore , the so called quantum confinement effect is a procedure that leads to the increment of the mass of electron , and an enhancement of the electron to choose a more stable state .",
    "our results indicate that the stability of the electron can be measured by the mass of the electron . the more confinement applied to a electron",
    ", the heavier  and more stable it seems to be . to enhance comprehension of the correlation between electron mass and its stability , it can be useful to consider some specific examples .",
    "special relativity says that a rapidly moving object will have a heavier mass than the same object at a relatively lower speed ( or at rest ) .",
    "our idea of this phenomenon is that the moving object has a tendency to be more stable ( because of the heavier mass ) .",
    "in fact , it is a common knowledge that , like a bullet , high - speed helical movement can greatly increase the stability of the bullet , and hence increase the mass of the bullet .",
    "next , let s consider the isotopic effect ( the dependence of @xmath81 on the square root of isotopic mass ) , which was interpreted as experimental evidence of the bcs theory of electron - phonon mediated . physically ,",
    "if the atomic nucleus has more neutrons , in one hand the nucleus will become less stable and in another hand it will weaken the interaction between nucleus and electron .",
    "these will directly cause the instability of electrons , consequently , decreasing both the mass of the pairing electrons and the superconductivity temperature @xmath81 .    in the above discussion",
    ", we have concluded that the mass of electron is the effect of quantum confinement : a stronger quantum confinement of electron will lead to the increment of the electron s mass , which is in good agreement with the experimental results . in the next subsection , we will show that the spin is no long as an intrinsic characteristic of electron and the spin itself is also a quantum confinement induced effect .",
    "as well known , the rules for spin came from playing with experimental data .",
    "so far the rules worked but remained mysterious .",
    "this mystery has inspired vast theoretical and experimental activity to analyze and understand the spin structure of the electron .",
    "but , in the past several decades scientists have achieved little success in this challenging problem .",
    "historically , uhlenbeck and goudsmit @xcite ( and separately kronig ) initially proposed a physical picture for the electron as a spinning charged sphere of radius equal to the so - called classical electron radius .",
    "according to this model , the resulting speed of the surface of the electron would be greater than the velocity of light . up to today",
    ", it seems the classical image of a body rotating about an axis is totally inadequate to describe the peculiar geometrical properties of intrinsic spin . in our opinion , it is still significative to ask : where is the electron spin coming from ? do we really have to accept that the spin is an intrinsic property of the electron with no classical explanation for it whatsoever",
    "?    it s important to note that electrons have been physically divided into two classes : the classical electrons ( spin - independent ) , and the quantum electrons ( spin - dependent ) .",
    "let s first recall the classical free electron model ( fermi gases ) , which was good for explaining the fermi energy , fermi surface , thermal property , specific heat , hall effect and electrical conduction of metals .",
    "for the quantum mechanical cases , a large variety of spin - dependent transport effects appears in different regimes of condensed matter physics : the josephson junction @xcite , giant magnetoresistance @xcite , fractional hall effect @xcite and spin hall effect @xcite , _",
    "etc_. with the consummation of sciences nowadays , it is not difficult to find that the so - called spin - dependent phenomena can only be observed at very small scales ( atomic scales ) and under some extreme conditions , such as ultra - low temperatures , ultra - high pressures , ultra - high density , extremely magnetic fields .",
    "it is quite strange that the spin - dependent behaviors are usually not seen at larger scales .",
    "these evidently condition - dependent spin - related physical properties inspire us to raise the following question : is the artificial concept of electron spin indeed intrinsic ? according to our logic it is without any doubt that intrinsic spin  means the properties of electron spin are condition - independent .",
    "of course , an electric charge is an intrinsic property of electrons , but spin should be excluded .",
    "the electron spin , once thought to be intrinsic , now has an extrinsic nature .",
    "we think it is about time for us to remove the shadow of mystery cast upon the electron spin presented by the quantum theory . in the following",
    ", we will clarify the origin of what physicists call intrinsic spin  by the scheme of the helical moving electrons .",
    "in this paper , it has been suggested that a stronger quantum confinement on electron will greatly reduce the electronic de broglie wavelength @xmath82 and at the same time can help the electron toward a more localized state ( or stable state ) .",
    "supposing @xmath83 , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] three kinds of electron ( or inducton ) of different de broglie wavelengths .",
    "[ fig8](a ) shows a localized electron that may only exist at the lowest possible temperature ( absolute zero ) .",
    "it is clear that , under this extreme condition , the electron will be experienced the strongest quantum confinement . as a result , the electron s de broglie wavelength @xmath80 and axial velocity @xmath36 are both equal to zero . in this special case ,",
    "the corresponding electrons can be considered as a localized ring current of left - hand or right - hand according to the original chirality of the electron of helical movement . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) , the ring can be characterized by a small magnetic moment associated with a quantum number @xmath84 which , we think , is the equivalent parameter of the so - called intrinsic electron spin defined by quantum theory . evidently , the quantum number ( spin ) @xmath84 can be either positive ( spin - up ) or negative ( spin - down ) depending on the chirality of the electron used to define it .",
    "in addition , we may note from the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) that each ring contains a certain amount electromagnetic energy @xmath85 which is likely the zero point vibrational energy ( zpe ) presented in quantum mechanics .",
    "the zpe resulted from principles of quantum mechanics is so enormous that many physicists have questioned : is the zero point energy real ? supposing that the concept of zpe is physically genuine , what we are mostly interested in whether or not our mechanism can provide a constructive interpretation of the zpe .    according to our theory , when a substance is cooled to absolute zero , inside the substance the electron s de broglie wavelength satisfies @xmath86 since the inductance @xmath37 ( @xmath83 ) of the current ring of fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) always remains to be a finite quantity , then with the eq .",
    "[ inducton ] we have @xmath87 , consequently the mass of electron @xmath88 ( as @xmath89 this suggests , according to einstein s mass - energy relation , that an absolute zero electron ( or ring ) contains an enormous amount of untapped electromagnetic energy ( infinite ) known as zero point energy or zpe . though our interpretation of zpe seems consistent with that of quantum theory , but the conclusion of infinite electron s mass implies that it is impossible to have an absolutely zpe condition .    in physics",
    ", there are few theories which claim to have universal significance on all scales .",
    "it has been proved that the quantum mechanics is valid for describing the bizarre rules of electron and light only at atomic scales .",
    "therefore , it becomes the first necessary to define a criterion by which we might distinguish between classical systems and quantum systems .",
    "after serious consideration , we think that the comparing the de broglie wavelength to the size of the object is a appropriate candidate of the criterion .",
    "figure [ fig8](b ) shows a traditional quantum system where the electron s de broglie wavelength ( @xmath32 has the atomic scale ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "we may note from the diagram that the quantized inducton  can be uniquely presented by a quasi- spin quantum number @xmath91 which averagely can also be either positive ( spin - up ) or negative ( spin - down ) according to the chirality of the electron .",
    "if we increase the ratio between @xmath80 and @xmath92 then the both wave and spin characteristic of electron will gradually become fuzzy .",
    "when @xmath93 , the studied system will be a real classical system and the state of corresponding electron is much easy to be disturbed by the extraneous factors . as a result ,",
    "it is impossible to define both the magnetic moment and the spin of the electron , and that is shown in fig .",
    "fig8(c ) .",
    "furthermore , we may note a particular case from the diagram of figure fig8 with the radius of the helical orbit @xmath94 for this case , the so - called intrinsic electron s spin ( strictly up and down ) can be defined for all three situations of the figure unless @xmath95 this implies that the quantum mechanism is nothing more than a limit ( @xmath96 of the @xmath1 mechanism .",
    "a comparison of different electrons from the @xmath1 mechanism s point of view is given by : ( i ) traditional classical electron : @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ( ii ) quantum mechanism electron : @xmath97 , and @xmath80 has a finite value ; and ( iii ) @xmath1 mechanism electron : both @xmath99 and @xmath80 are finite .",
    "obviously the electron , described by quantum mechanism ( ii ) , seems physically inconsistent .",
    "as can be seen , on the one hand @xmath97 indicates the vanishing of electron s wave property , on the other hand the finite @xmath100 implies the existing electron s wave property .",
    "quantum mechanism overcame this difficulty by factitiously introducing some uncertain and mysterious explanation of the microscopic particles .",
    "our results above reveal an essential connection between electron spin and the intrinsic helical movement of electron and indicate that the spin itself is the effect of quantum confinement , as well as provide new insights into quantum theory .",
    "furthermore , with these discussions it can be fairly easy to interpret the hardness property of electron . based on the well - known x - ray techniques ,",
    "the soft ( low - energy or long wavelength ) and hard x - rays ( high - energy or short wavelength ) are defined .",
    "a similar situation exists for the hardness property of electron .",
    "electrons are either hard or soft ( only possibilities ) depending upon the de broglie wavelength of the electrons .",
    "a harder electron has a shorter wavelength ( or a heavier mass ) , which implies that it contains more energy .",
    "hence , the harder electron can be regarded as a high - energy electron .",
    "likewise , the softer electron ( longer wavelength or lighter mass ) is a low - energy electron .",
    "this leads immediately to a very important conclusion of hardness property of electron : the quantum electron is harder and heavier than the classical electron .",
    "because of the high stability of the harder electron , obviously , the harder electron will have both longer lifetime and longer coherent length .",
    "otherwise , it has been proved much more difficult to remove the inner electron than the outer electron , our interpretation to this natural fact is : because the inner electron is harder and at the same time heavier than the outer electron of the same atom , therefore , the inner electron is harder to be removed .",
    "now we will discuss the magnetic monopole . in 1931",
    "dirac @xcite introduced a magnetic monopole into the quantum mechanics and found a quantization relation between an electric charge @xmath101 and magnetic charge @xmath102 , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the plank s constant divided by @xmath105 and @xmath63 is an integer .",
    "since then , numerous attempts of experimental search for these magnetic monopoles at accelerators and in cosmic rays have been done .",
    "though , recently a multinational research group claimed that the magnetic monopole can appear in the crystal momentum space @xcite .",
    "there has not yet been any firm evidence for its existence in real space . theoretically , t hooft @xcite pointed out that a unified gauge theory in which electromagnetism is embedded in a semisimple gauge group would predict the existence of the magnetic monopole as a soliton with spontaneous symmetry breaking , wu and yang first described magnetic monopoles in terms of a principal of fiber bundle @xcite , seiberg and witten developed the famous magnetic monopole equations @xcite .    here",
    "we are mostly concerned about the reason : why have no magnetic monopoles been detected after it had been hypothesized for 75 years ?",
    "there is a well - known reason : the magnetic monopoles are extremely heavy ( @xmath1061016gev ) and well beyond the capabilities of any reasonable particle accelerator to create .",
    "we do nt think the mass of magnetic monopoles can be a reasonable reason , personally , we are more incline to think magnetic monopoles are nt naturally real .",
    "we have an immature idea : is the concept of magnetic monopole only a well - known particle of different state ?",
    "in fact , seiberg - witten proved that there has an equivalent dual description through which electron and magnetic monopole are interconvertible . in the following discussion , it is shown that the magnetic monopole is , in fact , a handed electron at absolute zero - temperature and related to the spinof electron .",
    "the huge mass of magnetic monopoles means that they are going to be pretty slow ( or more localized ) .",
    "let us turn our attention to fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) of tremendous electron s mass , when @xmath107 the electron s circular orbit will gradually disappear thus the handed electron will degenerate into a structureless point charge of quantum theory .",
    "eventually , the so - called spin - up  and spin - down  heavy electrons will turn out to be the magic dirac s magnetic monopoles with north ( @xmath108 ) and south ( @xmath109 ) magnetic poles , respectively . note the case of @xmath97",
    "is unallowed in our theory , hence , the concept of magnetic monopoles is physically unreal .",
    "now , i am confident that any attempts for searching magnetic monopoles will be proved completely  valueless and furitless",
    ". suppose @xmath97 ( quantum mechanism approximation ) , based on the above discussions , it is clearly shown that the electron spin and magnetic monopole of quantum mechanism are just two different expressions for one and closely related thing of the mixed mechanism .",
    "in conclusion , we have found a process of perfect transformation of two forms of energy ( kinetic and field energy ) inside the hydrogen atom and the conservation of energy in the system .",
    "then , we have shown that the helical moving electron can be regarded as a inductive particle ( inducton ) while atom as a microscopic @xmath1 oscillator then the indeterministic quantum phenomena can be well explained by the deterministic classical theory . in particular , we have show that a pairing pauli electron can move closely and steadily in a dna - like double helical electron orbit .",
    "moreover , we have pointed out that the mass of electron , the zpe and what has been called the intrinsic electron spin  are all really the quantum confinement effects of the intrinsic chirality of the electron of helical motion . for superconductivity , we should be able to confine electron pairs to the low dimensional systems and produce a higher temperature superconductor .",
    "finally , we show analytically that the magnetic monopole is , in fact , a special handed electron ( @xmath97 ) at absolute zero - temperature with a de broglie wavelength @xmath7 this result indicates that any attempts to search for magnetic monopole in real space will be proved to be in vain . in addition , we have pointed out that the quantum mechanism s concepts of electron s spin and magnetic monopole are just two different expressions for one possible physical phenomenon .",
    "we have shown that the quantum mechanism is nothing but an approximate theory ( with the radius of the helical orbit @xmath96 of the @xmath110/wave - particle duality mixed mechanism .",
    "our mixed mechanics force us to rethink the nature and the nature of physical world .",
    "we believe all elementary particles , similar to photon and electron , are only some different types of energy representation .",
    "though , the standard quantum mechanics nature is intrinsically probabilistic , permitting only predictions about probabilities of the occurrence of an event .",
    "nevertheless , one century after its birth , it still presents many unclarified issues at its very foundations . starting from an einstein s work @xcite ,",
    "many attempts have been devoted to build a deterministic theory reproducing all the results of quantum mechanics .",
    "the latter include the de broglie - bohm s hidden variable theory , the most successful attempt in this sense @xcite .",
    "recently , a first experimental test of de broglie - bohm theory against standard quantum mechanics was reported @xcite . in our study , it has been shown definitely that the electron follows a perfectly defined trajectory in its motion , which confirms the de broglie - bohm s prediction .",
    "also in our work , it is found that the known wave - particle duality can be best manifested by showing that the wave motion associated with a electron is just the phenomenon of its complex helical motion in real space .",
    "therefore , the wave - particle duality should lie at the heart of the quantum universe .",
    "we are now more and more convinced that the universe was built in the simplest manner and all things in it are unique and definitive . as albel",
    "einstein one said , god does not play dice with the universe .",
    "of course , a more clear understanding of microscopic world is still of the greatest challenge ."

    "<S> we study the energy conversion laws of the macroscopic harmonic @xmath0 oscillator , the electromagnetic wave ( photon ) and the hydrogen atom . as our analysis indicates that the energies of these apparently different systems obey exactly the same energy conversion law . based on our results and the wave - particle duality of electron , we find that the atom in fact is a natural microscopic @xmath1 oscillator . in the framework of classical electromagnetic field theory </S>",
    "<S> we analytically obtain , for the hydrogen atom , the quantized electron orbit radius @xmath2 , and quantized energy @xmath3 ( @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bohr radius and @xmath6 is the rydberg constant . without the adaptation of any other fundamental principles of quantum mechanics , we present a reasonable explanation of the polarization of photon , the zeeman effect , selection rules and pauli exclusion principle . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , it is found that a pairing pauli electron can move closely and steadily in a dna - like double helical electron orbit . </S>",
    "<S> our results also reveal an essential connection between electron spin and the intrinsic helical movement of electron and indicate that the spin itself is the effect of quantum confinement . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a possible physical mechanism of superconductivity and the deeper physical understandings of the electron mass , zero point energy ( zpe ) , and the hardness property of electron are also provided . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show analytically that the dirac s quantization of magnetic monopole is merely a special handed electron at absolute zero - temperature with the de broglie wavelength @xmath7 this is a new and surprising result , which strongly suggests that any efforts to seek for the magnetic monopole in real space will be entirely in vain . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it appears that the electron s spin and the magnetic monopole are actually two different concepts for one possible physical phenomenon . </S>"
