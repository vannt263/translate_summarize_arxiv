    "in recent years , there has been a consistent experimental progress in the quantum - coherent manipulation of superconducting circuits based on the josephson effect .",
    "single - qubit operations have been demonstrated by now in charge @xcite , flux @xcite , charge - flux @xcite , and phase @xcite qubits .",
    "some of these experiments @xcite made it clear that in order to achieve long decoherence times the qubits have to be operated at the so - called optimal point , where the first order noise induced by fluctuations of external control parameters ( gate voltages , magnetic fluxes ) cancels .",
    "the notable exception from this rule is the phase qubit , which by construction does not have an optimal point ; this is compensated by engineering a peculiar bias circuit @xcite .",
    "the first - generation experiments with fixed coupling @xcite did manage to achieve two - qubit gates but the qubits were not operated at the optimal points , with a corresponding loss in fidelity .",
    "later it was noticed that flux qubits can be operated at the optimal point if the coupling is realized through a dc - squid modulated at the sum and difference of the qubits resonance frequencies @xcite .",
    "if the dc - squid is replaced by a third flux qubit , largely detuned from the frequencies of the two qubits , the coupling can be realized through the quantum inductance of the additional qubit @xcite .    with the advent of circuit qed architectures @xcite ,",
    "several qubits can be placed in the gap between the signal line and the ground of a coplanar waveguide resonator . in the dispersive qubit - resonator coupling regime , the qubit - qubit coupling",
    "are realized by virtually exciting the resonator .",
    "furthermore , due to the structured , cleaner electromagnetic environment around the qubits , relatively long decoherence time can be achieved .    finally , since any additional coupling elements tend to introduce extra decoherence in the system , one can place a further restriction and ask the question : is it possible to devise schemes in which the qubits are operated at the optimal points and there are no active additional elements for coupling ?",
    "the first such proposal was inspired from nmr : the so - called flicforq protocol @xcite , with coupling realized through the dressed states of each qubit under on - resonance microwave fields .",
    "the protocol was extended to more general detuned driving fields @xcite , but although theoretically sound , it has not been realized yet experimentally . in the flicforq protocol ,",
    "the fixed coupling is much smaller than the qubit - qubit detuning ; even under the enhancement the effective coupling strength is up to only one eighth of the bare coupling strength @xcite .",
    "a small coupling strength is desirable for single - qubit operations , but limit the two - qubit gate speed .",
    "therefore , one very interesting question emerges : is it possible to develop a protocol which retains the advantages of flicforq and has also the capability of performing fast two - qubit gates ? in this work we will analyze such a protocol , in which the two qubits are relatively strong coupled in the absence of driving fields ; moreover , we show explicitly how to construct microwave pulses to switch the coupling off .",
