    "in the last year there has been tremendous progress in the computation of baryon masses within lattice qcd . improved quark @xcite and gluon @xcite actions , together with increasing computer speed",
    "means that one already has results for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and vector meson masses for full qcd with two flavors of dynamical quarks .",
    "although the results are mainly in the regime where the pion mass @xmath3 is above 500 mev , there has been some exploration as low as 300 - 400 mev on a 3.0 fm lattice by cp - pacs @xcite .    in spite of these impressive developments",
    "it is still necessary to extrapolate the calculated results to the physical pion mass ( @xmath4 mev ) in order to make a comparison with experimental data . in doing",
    "so one necessarily encounters some non - linearity in the quark mass ( or @xmath5 ) , including the non - analytic behavior associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "indeed , the recent cp - pacs study @xcite did report the first behavior of this kind in baryon systems .",
    "as the computational resources necessary to include three light flavors with realistic masses will not be available for many years , it is vital to develop a sound understanding of how to extrapolate to the physical pion mass .",
    "we recently investigated this problem for the case of the nucleon magnetic moments @xcite .    the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) @xcite is an extension of the mit bag model incorporating chiral symmetry .",
    "it therefore generates the same leading non - analytic ( lna ) behavior as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6pt ) .",
    "this model was recently generalized to allow for variable quark and pion masses in order to explore the likely mass dependence of the magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "this work led to several important results :    * a series expansion of @xmath7 in powers of @xmath8 is not a useful approximation for @xmath8 larger than the physical mass , * on the other hand , the behavior of the model , after adjustments to fit the lattice data at large @xmath8 was well determined by the simple pad approximant : @xmath9 * eq.([mag - mom ] ) not only builds in the dirac moment at moderately large @xmath10 but has the correct lna behavior of chiral perturbation theory @xmath11 with @xmath12 a model independent constant , as @xmath13 . * fixing @xmath12 at the value given by chiral perturbation theory and adjusting @xmath14 and @xmath15 to fit the lattice data yielded values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , at the physical pion mass .",
    "these are significantly closer to the experimental values than the usual linear extrapolations in @xmath20 .",
    "clearly it is vital to extend the lattice calculations of baryon magnetic moments to lower values of @xmath8 than the 600 mev used in the study just outlined .",
    "it is also important to include dynamical quarks .",
    "nevertheless , the apparent success of the extrapolation procedure suggested by the cbm study gives us strong encouragement to investigate the same approach for baryon masses .",
    "accordingly , in this paper we study the variation of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses with @xmath8 ( or equivalently @xmath20 ) .",
    "section [ analyticity - sec ] is devoted to considerations of the low - lying singularities and pion - induced cuts in the complex plane of the nucleon and @xmath2 spectral representation .",
    "the analytic properties of the derived phenomenological form are consistent with both chiral perturbation theory and the expected behavior at large @xmath20 .",
    "this phenomenological form is eventually fitted to recent two - flavor , full qcd measurements made by cp - pacs @xcite and ukqcd @xcite . however , to gain some insight into the parameters and behavior of the functional form we examine the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses as described in the cbm in section [ cbm - calc - sec ] . in section [ lattice - fit - sec ]",
    "we apply the analytic form to the lattice data .",
    "section [ discussion - sec ] is reserved for a summary of our findings .",
    "by now it is well established that chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in qcd and that the pion is almost a goldstone boson . as a result",
    "it is strongly coupled to baryons and therefore plays a significant role in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 self energies . in the limit where the baryons are heavy ,",
    "the pion induced self - energies of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 , to one loop , are given by the processes shown in fig .",
    "[ se - fig ] .",
    "note that we have restricted the intermediate baryon states to those most strongly coupled , namely the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states .",
    "the analytic expression for the pion cloud correction to the masses of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are of the form @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 we note that @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the axial charge of the nucleon , @xmath27 is the pion energy and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath30 form factors associated with the emission of a pion of three momentum @xmath33 .",
    "we have used su(6 ) symmetry to relate the four coupling constants to the @xmath31 coupling , which , in turn , has been related to @xmath34 by chiral symmetry .",
    "the form factors arise naturally in any chiral quark model because of the finite size of the baryonic source of the pion field  which suppresses the emission probability at high virtual pion momentum . as a result ,",

    "in particular , it should be sufficient for studying the lnac to evaluate the self - energy integrals using a simple sharp cut - off , @xmath36 . in section [ cbm - calc - sec ] we shall compare the results with those calculated using a phenomenological , dipole form factor and show that this is in fact an effective simplification .    using a @xmath37-function for the form factors , the @xmath31 and @xmath38 integrals ( c.f",

    "( [ reduced - dn - form ] ) yields : @xmath56 of course , our concern with respect to lattice qcd is not so much the behavior as @xmath50 , but the extrapolation from high pion masses to the physical pion mass . in this context",
    "the branch point at @xmath57 is at least as important as the lna near @xmath58 .",
    "we shall return to this point later .",
    "we note that banerjee and milana @xcite found the same non - analytic behavior as @xmath59 that we find .",
    "however they were not concerned with finding a form that could be used at large pion masses ",
    "i.e. one that is consistent with heavy quark effective theory .",
    "heavy quark effective theory suggests that as @xmath60 the quarks become static and hadron masses become proportional to the quark mass .",
    "this has been rather well explored in the context of successful nonrelativistic quark models of charmonium and bottomium@xcite . in this spirit",
    ", corrections are expected to be of order @xmath61 where @xmath20 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "thus we would expect the pion induced self energy to vanish as @xmath61 as the pion mass increases .",
    "the presence of a fixed cut - off @xmath62 acts to suppress the pion induced self energy for increasing pion masses , as evidenced by the @xmath5 in the denominators of eqs .",
    "( [ se - nn - integral - eqn ] ) , ( [ se - nd - integral - eqn ] ) and ( [ se - dn - integral - eqn ] ) . while some @xmath5 dependence in @xmath62 is expected , this is a second - order effect and does not alter the qualitative features . by expanding the @xmath63 term in eq .",
    "( [ nn - form - eqn ] ) for small @xmath64 , we find @xmath65 which vanishes for @xmath66 . indeed , in the large @xmath8 ( heavy quark ) limit , both eqs .",
    "( [ reduced - nd - form ] ) and ( [ reduced - dn - form ] ) tend to zero as @xmath67 .",
    "we now have the chiral and heavy quark limits for each of the four integrals in fig.[se - fig ] .",
    "these expressions , which contain a single parameter , @xmath62 , are correct in the chiral limit - i.e. , they reproduce the first two non - analytic terms of @xmath6pt .",
    "they also have the correct behavior in the limit of large pion mass , namely they vanish like @xmath67 .",
    "the latter feature would be destroyed if we were to retain only the lna pieces of the self - energies as they would diverge at large @xmath8 faster than @xmath20 .",
    "rather than simplifying our expressions to just the lna terms , we therefore retain the complete expressions , as they contain important physics that would be lost by making a simplification .",
    "we note that keeping the entire form is not in contradiction with @xmath6pt , as we have already shown that the leading non - analytic structure of @xmath6pt is contained in this form .",
    "however as one proceeds to larger quark ( pion ) masses , differences between the full forms and the expressions in the chiral limit will become apparent .",
    "for example , the branch point at @xmath68 , which is an essential non - analytic component of the @xmath69-dependence of the self - energy and which should dominate in the region @xmath70 , is also satisfactorily incorporated in eqs.([reduced - nd - form ] ) and ( [ reduced - dn - form ] ) . yet",
    "the lna chiral terms given in section [ chirlim ] know nothing of this branch point and are clearly inappropriate in the region near and beyond @xmath71 .    as a result of these considerations",
    ", we propose to use the analytic expressions for the self - energy integrals corresponding to a sharp cut - off in order to incorporate the correct lna structure in a simple three - parameter description of the @xmath8-dependence of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses . in the heavy quark limit",
    "hadron masses become proportional to the quark mass . moreover , as we shall see in the next section , the mit bag model leads to a linear dependence of the mass of a baryon on the current quark mass far below the scale at which one would expect the heavy quark limit to apply .",
    "this is a simple consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics for a scalar confining field . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice calculations indicate that the scale at which the pion mass exhibits a linear dependence on @xmath72 is much larger than that for baryons .",
    "in fact , over the range of masses of interest to us , explicit lattice calculations show that @xmath73 is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "hence we can simulate a linear dependence of the baryon masses on the quark mass , @xmath72 , in this region , by adding a term involving @xmath10 .",
    "the functional form for the mass of the nucleon suggested by this analysis is then : @xmath74 while that for the @xmath2 is : @xmath75 the mass in the chiral limit is given by @xmath76 where the meson cloud effects are explicitly contained in @xmath77 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath2 in the chiral limit is calculated in an analogous way . we know that ( [ n - form - eqn ] ) and ( [ d - form - eqn ] ) have the correct behavior in the chiral limit .",
    "individually , they also have the correct heavy quark behavior .",

    "this is only guaranteed by eqs .",

    "( [ nn - heavy - lim ] ) ) if the entire mass difference arises from the pion self - energy . while one could enforce this condition through the introduction of additional parameters and a more complicated analytic structure for the higher - order terms of eqs .",
    "( [ n - form - eqn ] ) and ( [ d - form - eqn ] ) , we prefer to focus on the regime of @xmath73 from 1 gev@xmath79 to the chiral limit .",
    "as we shall see , eqs .",
    "( [ n - form - eqn ] ) and ( [ d - form - eqn ] ) are quite adequate for this purpose . ] between the chiral and heavy - quark limits there are no general guidelines , so in the next section we shall compare our functional form to the cloudy bag model , a successful phenomenological approach incorporating chiral symmetry and the correct heavy quark limit .",
    "as a guide to the quark mass dependence of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses we consider the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) @xcite .",
    "this is a minimal extension of the mit bag model such that chiral symmetry is restored , which has proven quite successful in a number of phenomenological studies of baryon properties and meson - baryon scattering @xcite . within the cbm",
    ", a baryon is viewed as a superposition of a bare quark core and bag plus meson states .",
    "the linearized cbm lagrangian with pseudovector pion - quark coupling ( to order @xmath80 ) is @xcite : @xmath81 \\theta _ { v}-\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{q}q\\delta   _ { s}\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial _ { \\mu } \\bfgreek { \\pi   } ) ^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}m^{2}_{\\pi } \\bfgreek { \\pi } ^{2 } +    \\frac{\\theta _ { v}}{2f_{\\pi   } } \\bar{q } \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma _ { 5 } \\bfgreek { \\tau } q    \\cdot \\partial_\\mu \\bfgreek { \\pi }   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the bag constant , @xmath83 is the @xmath84 decay constant , @xmath85 is a step function ( unity inside the bag volume and vanishing outside ) and @xmath86 is a surface delta function . in a lowest order perturbative treatment of the pion field , the quark wave function is not effected by the pion field and is simply given by the mit bag solution @xcite .    in principle",
    "the @xmath87 form factor can be directly calculated within the model .",
    "it dies off at large momentum transfer because of the finite size of the baryon source . rather than using this calculated form factor , which is model dependent ,",
    "we have chosen to use a common phenomenological form , namely a simple dipole : @xmath88 where @xmath33 is the magnitude of the loop ( 3-)momentum , @xmath89 is the physical pion mass ( 139.6 mev ) , and @xmath90 is a regulation parameter .    in the standard cbm treatment , where the pion is treated as an elementary field ,",
    "the current quark mass , @xmath20 , is not directly linked to @xmath8 .",
    "most observables are not sensitive to this parameter , as long as it is in the range of typical current quark masses . for our present purpose",
    "it is vital to relate the @xmath20 inside the bag with @xmath8 .",
    "current lattice simulations indicate that @xmath5 is approximately proportional to @xmath20 over a wide range of quark masses @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to model the lattice results , we scale the mass of the quark confined in the bag as @xmath91 , with @xmath92 being the current quark mass corresponding to the physical pion mass @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath92 is treated as an input parameter to be tuned to the lattice results , but in our magnetic moment study it turned out to lie in the range 6 to 7 mev , which is very reasonable .",
    "the parameters of the cbm are obtained as follows .",
    "the bag constant @xmath82 and the phenomenological parameter @xmath93 are fixed by the physical nucleon mass and the stability condition , and the @xmath87 form factor may all depend on @xmath72 , this dependence is expected to be a smaller effect and we ignore such variations in order to avoid an excess of parameters . ]",
    "@xmath94 , for a given choice of @xmath95 and @xmath92 .",
    "for each subsequent value of the pion mass or the quark mass considered , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are determined simultaneously from the linear boundary condition @xcite and the stability condition . in this work",
    "we have calculated the mass of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryons as a function of squared pion mass ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cbm - masses - fig ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 calculation is similar to that for the @xmath1 , however the value of @xmath82 is fixed to be the same as that used for the nucleon , while @xmath93 is adjusted to fit the observed mass difference , taking into account the pionic contribution to this quantity , at the physical value @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "as expected on quite general grounds ( and discussed in section [ analyticity - sec ] ) , as the pion mass increases the mass of the baryon does indeed become linear in @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , from the curvature at low pion mass , we see that the non - analytic structure is important in the region @xmath8 below 400 mev .",
    "we now fit our functional forms for the baryon masses , eqs .",
    "( [ n - form - eqn ] ) and ( [ d - form - eqn ] ) , to the cbm data .",
    "we note that the cbm data is generated using a phenomenologically motivated , dipole form factor , whereas the functional form used in the fit involves a @xmath37 cut - off . in order to simulate the fitting procedure for lattice data ,",
    "our fit to the cbm results involves only pion masses above the physical branch point at @xmath100 , followed by an extrapolation to lower pion mass .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ cbm - masses - fig ] that our extrapolation to the physical pion mass is in good agreement with the cbm calculations : at the physical pion mass the extrapolated @xmath1 mass is within 0.8% of the experimental value to which the cbm was fitted , while the @xmath2 is within 0.3% of the experimental value .",
    "we present the parameters of our fit in table [ cbm - params - table ] .",
    "the value for the sharp cut - off ( @xmath62 ) is 0.44(2 ) gev , compared to @xmath1011 gev for the dipole form factor .",
    "it was noted in section [ analyticity - sec ] that the constant @xmath12 in our functional form is not the mass of the baryon in the chiral limit , but rather this is given by @xmath102  with an analogous expression for the @xmath2 .",

    "in the quest to connect lattice measurements with the physical regime , we have explored the quark mass dependence of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryon masses using arguments based on analyticity and heavy quark limits . in the region where @xmath106 is larger than 500 mev",
    ", the lattice data can be reasonably well described by the simple form , @xmath107 , which is linear in the quark mass .",
    "the additional curvature associated with chiral corrections only appears below this region .",
