    "hazes and clouds in the atmospheres of jovian planets can strongly affect the ability to determine atmospheric composition at ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths . at wavelengths shorter than @xmath2600  nm",
    ", the atmospheric line features in the jovian planets are  washed out \" by the hazes / clouds in the atmospheres of planets ( e.g. , karkoschka & tomasko 1993 ; karkoschka 1998 ) .",
    "the main chemical compositions of the hazes / clouds on jupiter are believed to be h@xmath3o - nh@xmath4 , nh@xmath0sh , nh@xmath4 , n@xmath3h@xmath0 , and hydrocarbons from several bar to @xmath20.1  mbar @xcite .",
    "saturn may have a composition profile similar to jupiter since they have similar 300 - 1000  nm spectra ( e.g. , karkoschka 1998 ) .",
    "saturn s albedo has been successfully modelled by assuming a dichotomy in the aerosol distribution between the troposphere and stratosphere , where the number density of aerosols is much lower in the stratosphere @xcite .",
    "it is found that the stratospheric aerosols are very dark at @xmath2300  nm , implying the presence of hydrocarbon aerosols .    since the recent increase in sample size of extrasolar planets ( e.g. , udry et al .",
    "2002 ; butler et al .",
    "2003 ) , the planetary formation environment has been statistically analyzed , although not conclusively @xcite .",
    "the close - in extrasolar giant planets ( cegps , with semi - major axes @xmath5 au , also known as  hot jupiters \" ) are of particular interest since they have more active chemical processes in their atmospheres ( e.g. , liang et al . 2003 ) and the evolution of the atmospheres can currently be studied observationally ( e.g. , vidal - madjar et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "a number of simulations in the atmospheres of cegps have been performed to study the albedos and reflection spectra by including the formation of high temperature condensates , such as silicates ( e.g. , sudarsky et al . 2000 ; seager et al .",
    "2000 ) . the importance and existence of the atmospheric aerosols have been addressed and discussed widely in recent years ( e.g. , baraffe et al .",
    "2003 ) and it is generally believed that more uv flux will result in more aerosols .",
    "the photochemistry in jovian atmospheres results in photochemical aerosols which significantly affect the ultraviolet - visible spectra and albedos ; hence we were motivated to simulate the formation of various molecules , e.g. , hydrocarbons , ammonia , and sulfuric acid , which are the possible sources of aerosols , in the atmospheres of cegps . in this letter , we focus on hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon aerosol formation .",
    "a one - dimensional caltech / jet propulsion laboratory kinetics model is applied to hd  209458b s atmosphere , which is divided into 80 plane - parallel layers along the radial direction .",
    "the planet is probably tidally locked and our simulation is performed on the day side .",
    "the model assumes the four parent molecules@xmath6 h@xmath3 , co , h@xmath3o , and ch@xmath0 .",
    "the abundances of co and h@xmath3o for the reference model ( model a ) are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the ch@xmath0 abundance is taken to be @xmath9 , which is the low bound predicted by @xcite .",
    "the temperature - pressure profiles are not certain , because the global circulation and high temperature condensation are not constrained in generating the model atmosphere .",
    "our reference profile ( solid curve in figure  [ profile ] ) is a derivative of a cloud - free and high temperature condensation - free model .",
    "the stellar irradiance is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the whole planet ; this gives the lower bound of the temperature profile in the atmosphere of hd  209458b . in view of the aforementioned uncertainty ,",
    "two alternative temperature profiles , which assume the redistribution of the stellar irradiance evenly only on the day side , are examined @xcite .    a one - dimensional , photochemical - diffusive ,",
    "diurnally averaged numerical model for hydrocarbon photochemistry has been presented by @xcite in the atmosphere of jupiter . in that study ,",
    "important chemical cycles and pathways involving c@xmath10-c@xmath11 species are identified .",
    "included in this analysis are sensitivity studies on a standard reference model with respect to variations in the eddy - diffusion profile , solar flux , atomic hydrogen influx , latitude , temperature , and important chemical reaction rates .",
    "the model reproduces extensive observations of hydrocarbon species as well as he 584   and h lyman-@xmath12 airglow emissions on jupiter . due to the incomplete laboratory measurements of reaction rates and photodissociation quantum yields in the c@xmath4 and higher hydrocarbons , we use a simplified version of the hydrocarbon photochemical model by @xcite .",
    "the hydrocarbon chemistry up to the c@xmath3 hydrocarbons is modelled thoroughly in the atmosphere of hd  209458b .",
    "the c@xmath10 and c@xmath3 hydrocarbons are the fundamental ingredient for building up complex hydrocarbons , e.g. , benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , through long chain polyynes and polymerization .",
    "the chemical pathways among the c@xmath10 and c@xmath3 in the atmospheres of cegps were first pointed out by @xcite , which are fundamentally different from the pathways on the colder jovian planets @xcite .",
    "the full version of the hydrocarbon photochemical model is also verified . the oxygen related photochemistry is taken from @xcite .",
    "figure  [ profile ] shows the temperature profiles for three models @xcite . for each case , we have examined five different initial chemical abundances for ch@xmath0 , co , and h@xmath3o as tabulated in table  [ abundance ] . due to the unconstrained ch@xmath0 abundance ,",
    "we have varied it by several orders of magnitudes to study its sensitivity in the formation of hydrocarbons .",
    "however , we expect co to be the dominant reservoir of carbon for the range of temperatures in the atmospheres of cegps and assume this in our reference model  a. the models of @xcite and @xcite go only to 1 and 0.1  @xmath13bar pressure levels , respectively@xmath6 we assume the profiles are isothermal above these pressure levels .",
    "the parameters for the reference eddy - diffusion profile ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is number density ) are taken to be @xmath16  @xmath17  s@xmath18 , @xmath19  @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we also varied @xmath22 and @xmath12 to test the sensitivity of the results on eddy - diffusion ( see table  [ column ] ) .",
    "the fiducial eddy - diffusion used here is consistent with the upper limit estimates from @xcite .",
    "rrrr a & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath24 + b & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 + c & @xmath23 & @xmath25 & @xmath24 + d & @xmath26 & @xmath24 & @xmath24 + e & @xmath24 & @xmath24 & @xmath24",
    "our modeling shows that gas phase hydrocarbons are most likely present in very low abundances in the atmospheres of cegps .",
    "this result is in contrast to the high abundances of hydrocarbons on the solar jovian planets .",
    "the vertical profiles of the hydrocarbons for various models are shown in figure  [ mr ] and the maximum and column integrated hydrocarbons are tabulated in table  [ column ] .",
    "the hydrocarbons are produced and concentrated mainly in the middle atmosphere , around 0.1  mbar . because the framework of hydrocarbon formation on the jovian planets is well understood , we explain our results in comparison to the photochemical production of hydrocarbons on the jovian planets .",
    "there are two known chemical schemes for the formation of hydrocarbons in the jovian atmospheres and their satellites .",
    "the first is via the synthesis of long chain polyynes from c@xmath3h@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the second is the polymerization of c@xmath3h@xmath3 to form ring compounds @xcite . in both cases",
    ", c@xmath3h@xmath3 plays a crucial role .",
    "therefore , to explain why hydrocarbon aerosols are not formed in cegps , we have to explain why c@xmath3h@xmath3 concentrations are so low .",
    "this is due primarily to the high temperatures in the atmospheres of cegps and secondarily to the high uv flux .",
    "both the high temperatures and high uv fluxes are a direct consequence of the cegps closer proximity to their parent stars .",
    "one reason for low hydrocarbon abundances in cegps is because the abundance of ch@xmath0 is many orders of magnitudes lower than that in the jovian atmospheres .",
    "the ch@xmath0 abundance is important because in the jovian atmospheres hydrocarbon formation is driven by the photodissociation of ch@xmath0 and the subsequent reactions of the products ( e.g. , gladstone et al .",
    "the three species , c@xmath3h@xmath3 , c@xmath3h@xmath0 , and c@xmath3h@xmath27 , are important for forming more complex hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon aerosols .",
    "the primary reservoir of c in cegps is co , not ch@xmath0 , as in the jovian planets .",
    "this is due to the much higher temperatures in the atmospheres of cegps ( effective temperatures @xmath1  k ) compared to jupiter ( effective temperature @xmath2130  k ) .",
    "@xcite showed that c compounds are initiated by c atoms produced by the photolysis of co in the upper atmosphere .",
    "the hydrocarbons ( c@xmath3h@xmath3 , c@xmath3h@xmath0 , and c@xmath3h@xmath27 ) are formed along with ch@xmath0 from the c atoms .",
    "a second reason for the low abundance of hydrocarbons is that hydrogenation of c@xmath3h@xmath3 to ch@xmath0 by the pathways given in @xcite ( see also chapter  5 of yung and demore 1999 ) rapidly removes c@xmath3h@xmath3 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the cegps have a high concentration of h atoms formed via an h@xmath3o mediated process .",
    "hydrogenation is the dominant removal process of c@xmath3h@xmath3 in cegps and is driven by the high concentration of h atoms . unlike the colder jovian atmospheres , the hydrocarbon loss via photolysis is minor in the atmospheres of cegps .",
    "a key reaction in hydrogenation of c@xmath3h@xmath3 to ch@xmath0 is the reaction c@xmath3h@xmath4 + h@xmath3 @xmath28 c@xmath3h@xmath0 + h. the reaction that breaks the h@xmath3 bond is fast for the high temperatures in the atmospheres of cegps ; however in the colder atmospheres of the jovian planets this reaction is the major bottleneck to hydrogenation of c@xmath3h@xmath3 .",
    "hydrogenation as a cause of low hydrocarbon abundances is therefore related to the high temperatures in the atmospheres of cegps which are hot enough not only for the rapid hydrogenation rate but also for h@xmath3o to be present in vapor form .",
    "in contrast to the jovian planets and their satellites , water is frozen into ice and not available for photolysis .    to show the robustness of the result of low hydrocarbon abundances in the atmospheres of cegps , we varied the input parameters to our photochemical model .",
    "we find that over a broad range of input parameters , i.e. , initial chemical abundances and temperature and eddy - diffusion profiles , the hydrocarbon formation in the atmospheres of cegps never exceeds that of jupiter . in our model of an extremely abundant ch@xmath0 ( model  e ) , the column integrated hydrocarbon is about 0.5 that of jupiter s ( see table  [ column ] ) .",
    "however , this is an extreme and unlikely high ch@xmath0 abundance  the hot atmospheric temperatures favor co as the dominant reservoir of c.    rlllll jupiter & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & 1 + a  1 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath31 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 +  a  1 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath31 & @xmath39 & @xmath36 +  a  1 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath35 & @xmath43 +  a  1 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 + b  1 & @xmath49 & @xmath37 & @xmath45 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 + c  1 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath52 + d  1 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath44 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 + e  1 & @xmath57 & @xmath32 & @xmath58 & @xmath42 & 0.4 + e  2 & @xmath59 & @xmath49 & @xmath30 & @xmath60 & 0.3 + e  3 & @xmath61 & @xmath32 & @xmath30 & @xmath62 & 0.6",
    "using a simplified version of the caltech / jpl kinetics model , we have shown that the concentrations of the c@xmath3h@xmath63 species ( see table  [ column ] ) are insignificant in the atmospheres of cegps .",
    "these c@xmath3h@xmath63 compounds are important sources for forming more complex c@xmath64h@xmath65 species , such as benzene and pahs , which will lead to the formation of hydrocarbon aerosols ( e.g. , richter & howard 2000 , 2002 ) . although we have used a simplified photochemical model that captures the main reactions , we have tested models a - e using the reference temperature profile ( solid - line in figure  [ profile ] ) incorporating the full version of hydrocarbon model by @xcite . even for this case , we find that the c@xmath27h@xmath27 abundance for model a is seven orders of magnitudes less than that of jupiter and is two orders of magnitudes less for model  e. sulfur and nitrogen containing compounds are other potential sources for aerosols and we plan to explore their photochemistry in a later paper .",
    "the cegps are extremely close to the parent star ; in such an extreme environment , the c@xmath64h@xmath65 compounds will be lost either primarily by reactions with atomic hydrogen or also by photolysis .",
    "the production of atomic hydrogen is a consequence both of the high temperatures that allow the presence of h@xmath3o vapor and of the high uv flux that causes photolysis of h@xmath3o .",
    "therefore , the lifetime of the c@xmath64h@xmath65 compounds in the atmospheres of cegps is predicted to be much shorter than that on jupiter .",
    "the lifetimes of the hydrocarbons are @xmath66  s , which are significantly shorter than the simulated circulation timescale of @xmath2day @xcite .",
    "hence the abundances of the hydrocarbons will be affected by a factor of ` a few ' through the relatively longer lifetime of the atomic hydrogen ( @xmath21 day , liang et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the condensation temperatures for hydrocarbons ( e.g. , c@xmath0h@xmath3 and c@xmath0h@xmath67 ) are below 200  k at @xmath21  mbar ( moses et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these temperatures are far colder than expected in the atmospheres of cegps @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we verified this by considering the saturation profiles together with the the temperature profiles and found that the required saturation pressure for cegps is far more than that present in the atmospheres .    using the measured rayleigh scattering cross sections of he and h@xmath3 @xcite ,",
    "the pressure level with optical depth unity is @xmath21  bar at 300  nm and increases rapidly at longer wavelengths ( rayleigh scattering cross section @xmath68 ) . without the shielding from the atmospheric aerosols and in the absence of high - temperature condensate clouds",
    ", we may be able to observe the atmospheric composition at short wavelengths up to the rayleigh scattering limit .    in this letter , we have emphasized photolytically driven processes involving neutral species .",
    "we have not considered the possibility of ion - neutral chemistry , such as that found in the polar region of jupiter @xcite .",
    "this may be important in the atmospheres of cegps if the planet possesses a magnetic field .",
    "if the hydrocarbon aerosols can be formed in the polar region , then global circulation will redistribute them to lower latitudes .",
    "stellar wind may be another source of energetic charged particles that could result in the formation of aerosols .",
    "another subject not addressed in this work is the formation of aerosols by heterogeneous nucleation in the presence of pre - existing solid dust grains . in this case , the formation of aerosols would be sensitive to the amount of dust particles in the atmosphere .    additionally , we find that the mixing ratios of c , o , s , and c@xmath3h@xmath3 ( other than h ) are high at the top of the atmosphere , implying that these particles can readily escape .",
    "the recent detection of c and o in the extended upper atmosphere of hd  209458b by @xcite supports this assertion and we comment that hydrodynamically escaping atmospheric species will yield new information on the evolution of cegps .",
