    "the milky way is known to possess spiral structure .",
    "however , revealing the nature of this structure has proven to be elusive for decades .",
    "the @xcite study of hii regions produced what has been generally considered the `` standard model '' for the spiral structure of the galaxy .",
    "however , after decades of study there is little agreement on this structure .",
    "indeed , we do not really know the number of spiral arms @xcite or how tightly wound is their pattern .",
    "the primary reason for the difficulty is the lack of accurate distance measurements throughout the galaxy .",
    "photometric distances are prone to calibration problems , which become especially severe when looking through copious dust to distant objects in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "thus , most attempts to map the galaxy rely on radio frequency observations and kinematic distances , which involve matching source doppler shifts with those expected from a model of galactic rotation .",
    "however , because of distance ambiguities in the first and fourth quadrants ( where most of the spiral arms are found ) and the existence of sizeable non - circular motions , kinematic distances can be highly uncertain @xcite .",
    "we are measuring trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of sources of maser emission associated with high - mass star forming regions ( hmsfrs ) , using the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the japanese vlbi exploration of radio astronomy ( vera ) project .",
    "the great advantage of trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions is that one determines source distances directly and geometrically , with no assumptions about luminosity , extinction , metallicity , crowding , etc .",
    "also , from the same measurements , one determines proper motions , and if the time sampling is optimal there is little if any correlation between the parallax and proper motion estimates .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the proper motion does not affect the parallax accuracy .",
    "combining all of the observational data yields the full 3-dimensional locations and velocity vectors of the sources .",
    "results for 12 ghz methanol ( ) masers toward 10 hmsfrs , carried out with the vlba ( program br100 ) , are reported in the first five papers in this series @xcite , hereafter papers i through v , respectively .",
    "eight other sources with  or sio masers have been measured with vera @xcite and with methanol ,  or continuum emission with the vlba @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we collect these parallaxes and proper motions in order to study the spiral structure of the galaxy .",
    "combining positions , distances , doppler shifts , and proper motions , allows us not only to locate the hmsfrs that harbor the target maser sources in 3-dimensions , but also to determine their 3-dimensional space motions . in ",
    "[ sect : spiral_structure ] we map the locations of the hmsfrs and measure the pitch angles of some spiral arms . in ",
    "[ sect : gal_dynamics ] we use the full 3-dimensional spatial and kinematic information to examine the non - circular ( peculiar ) motions of these star forming regions .",
    "we also fit the data with a model of the galaxy and estimate the distance from the sun to the galactic center ( ) and the circular orbital speed at the sun ( ) .",
    "the nature of the rotation curve and its effect on estimates of  and is also discussed . in  [ sect : k_dist ] we compare kinematic distances with those determined by trigonometric parallax and offer a new prescription to improve such distance estimates . in  [ sect : gal_coordinates ] we discuss limitations of the current definition of galactic coordinates and suggest a new system based partly on dynamical information .",

    "however , the parallax uncertainties for these distant , low - declination sources are currently not adequate to clearly distinguish among these arms , especially in the crowded region where the galactic bar ( see @xcite and references therein ) ends and the arms begin @xcite .    three sources ( g  35.2@xmath90.7 , g  35.2@xmath91.7 and w  51  irs  2 ) are probably in the carina - sagittarius arm , whose distance from the sun is 2.5  kpc at galactic longitude , @xmath101 , of @xmath102 .",
    "five sources ( s  252 , w3(oh ) , iras  00420 + 5530 , ngc  281 , and ngc  7538 ) clearly trace a portion of the perseus arm , which is located between distances of 2.10  kpc at @xmath103 ( s  252 ) and 2.64  kpc at @xmath104 ( ngc  7538 ) .",

    "an ideal log - periodic spiral arm can be defined by the equation @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the galactocentric radius at a galactocentric longitude @xmath111 ( defined as 0 toward the sun and increasing with galactic longitude ) for an arm with a reference radius @xmath112 at @xmath113 . in figure",

    "thus we used unweighted straight line fits to estimate spiral arm pitch angles .",
    "the perseus arm sources ( excluding ngc  281 ) indicate a pitch angle of @xmath116 between galactic longitude 112  and 189 .",
    "this is in the upper half of pitch angle estimates of 5  to 21   for spiral arms in the galaxy collected by @xcite .",
    "the five hmsfrs with parallaxes that trace the local `` arm '' indicate a mean pitch angle of @xmath117 .",
    "however , the local arm is probably not a global spiral arm ; instead it appears to be a short segment or spur between the carina ",
    "sagittarius and perseus arms .",
    "two sources ( s  269 & wb89437 ) appear to be part of the outer arm and formally yield a pitch angle of @xmath118 .",
    "this suggests that the outer arm might have a smaller pitch angle than the perseus arm .",
    "this may be of significance , but with only two sources , more parallaxes are needed before reaching any firm conclusions .    for other spiral arms , we have too few parallaxes to reliably determine pitch angles .",

    "the three - dimensions of motion relative to the sun ( proper motion and heliocentric doppler shift ) are calculated from the source location , taking into account the size and rotation curve of the galaxy model , and the solar and source peculiar motions .",
    "we adopt the hipparcos determination of solar motion @xcite as definitive and generally did not vary these parameters . however , in one least - squares fit , we solved for these parameters for illustrative purposes in order to compare solar motion results from hipparcos stars and our hmsfrs .",
    "our choice of weights for the data in the least - squares fitting process requires some comment .",
    "while the heliocentric velocity of any maser spot can be measured with very high accuracy , it may not exactly reflect the motion of the hmsfr .",
    "the internal motions of methanol masers are generally small and cause uncertainty of @xmath124  @xcite , whereas  masers can be associated with fast outflow and , if not accurately modeled , can lead to larger uncertainty in the motion of the exciting star .",
    "in addition , the virial motion of an individual massive star ( associated with the masers ) with respect to the entire hmsfr is likely to be @xmath125  per coordinate ( for a region of mass of @xmath126  and radius of @xmath127  pc ) .",
    "therefore , we allow for a deviation of the measured motion from the center of mass of its associated hmsfr by adding an uncertainty of @xmath128   in quadrature with the internal motion estimates ( between 3 and 5  ) .",
    "specifically , the variance weights for the  data , @xmath129 , are calculated from @xmath130 .",
    "since the parallax data is compared to a kinematic model , we considered both the parallax measurement uncertainty and a modeling uncertainty for the kinematic distance , @xmath131 , owing to the total uncertainty in the heliocentric velocity of the associated hmsfr .",
    "these two components were added in quadrature when calculating the weights : @xmath132 , where @xmath133 .",
    "similarly , the proper motion weights allowed for both measurement uncertainties and the possible deviation of the measured maser motions from the center of mass of the hmsfr . the latter term was set by the uncertainty in the heliocentric velocity divided by the distance .",
    "thus , for either proper motion component @xmath134 .",
    "we first used all 18 sources listed in table  [ table : parallaxes ] and solved only for the fundamental galactic parameters , yielding @xmath135  kpc and @xmath136  for a flat rotation curve ( @xmath120 ) ( see fit  1 in table  [ table : fits ] ) .",
    "the  value of 263 for 70 degrees of freedom was quite large , and the post - fit residuals showed clear systematic deviations , indicating a deficiency in this 2-parameter model for galactic dynamics .",

    "both transformations assume @xmath139  kpc , a flat rotation curve , and the hipparcos solar motion of @xcite .",
    "( the equations used for the transformation are documented in the appendix . )",
    "sizeable systematic motions are clearly evident  almost all sources have a significant component of peculiar motion _ counter _ to galactic rotation . on average",
    "these star forming regions orbit the galaxy @xmath1  slower than the galaxy spins . as is evident from the two sets of peculiar motions , this conclusion is insensitive to the values adopted for .",
    "similarly , adopting a more complex rotation curve , the @xcite curve , would not change the qualitative nature of the residuals .",
    "_ hmsfrs appear to orbit the galaxy slower than for circular orbits .",

    "we believe the solar motion parameters determined from hipparcos data by @xcite are well determined , and they have been independently confirmed by @xcite , based on the southern proper - motion program data . however , it is instructive to solve for the solar motion parameters with the parallax and proper motion data . doing so we find an acceptable fit with @xmath140  kpc , @xmath141  , @xmath142  , @xmath143  and @xmath144  .",

    "the hipparcos data used to determine  ( the solar motion component in the direction of galactic rotation ) clearly show the well known `` asymmetric drift , '' which when extrapolated to zero dispersion should define the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "our value of @xmath143  , based on hmsfr parallaxes and proper motions , is far above the asymmetric drift line , indicating that the hmsfrs as a group are orbiting the galaxy slower than for circular orbits .",
    "note that the youngest stars in the hipparcos data , plotted at a dispersion of @xmath145  ( ) @xmath146 , show a similar , but not as great a departure from the asymmetric drift line .",
    "evidence that young stars lag the lsr orbit has also been found by @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that we find no evidence for a global motion of the lsr ( disagreement with the hipparcos solar motion ) in the direction of the galactic center or out of the plane of the galaxy larger than @xmath147  ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "this is contrary to the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite , based on an analysis of hi data , that the lsr is moving away from the galactic center at a speed of @xmath149  .",
    "since , as shown in  [ sect:3-d ] , hmsfrs are orbiting the galaxy slower than for circular orbits , we must allow for such effects when modeling the galaxy .",
    "in order to determine the fundamental parameters  and , we solved for three additional parameters , allowing for an average peculiar motion for all sources with components  toward the galactic center ( as seen by the source ) ,  in the local direction of galactic rotation and  toward the north galactic pole .",

    "we have accurately located three of the spiral arms of the milky way and directly measured a pitch angle of 16  for a portion of the perseus spiral arm .",
    "this pitch angle is similar to those of spiral arms in other galaxies of type sb to sc @xcite .",

    "there has been considerable discussion in the literature concerning the number of spiral arms in the galaxy @xcite , with spitzer glimpse survey results suggesting only two arms can be traced in the redder , older population of stars @xcite .",
    "perhaps the vlbi and infrared survey results can be reconciled if the milky way exhibits a hybrid structure , consisting of two dominant spiral arms , populated by both young and old stars and with pitch angles near @xmath232 , and two weaker arms traced only by young stars .",
    "our finding that hmsfrs on average orbit the galaxy @xmath1  slower than expected for circular orbits has implications for star formation and spiral density wave theory .",
    "the plot of the _ apparent _ solar motion in the direction of galactic rotation ( ) versus stellar dispersion ( figure  [ fig : hipparcos ] ) can be interpreted as a time sequence , with stellar age increasing with dispersion . the 15  slower orbital speed of hmsfrs displays as a positive departure of the apparent solar motion with respect to the asymmetric drift ( the fitted trend to the hipparcos data shown in figure  [ fig : hipparcos ] ) , since the sun _ appears _ to orbit faster when measured against such stars .",
    "one explanation for this finding is that hmsfrs are born in elliptical galactic orbits , near apocenter , with orbital eccentricity of about 0.06 .",
    "as young stars continue to orbit the galaxy , their orbits become more circularized , as evidenced by the lesser departure of the youngest hipparcos bin ( mostly late b - type stars ) from the asymmetric drift line compared to the hmsfrs . the gradual transfer of angular momentum from gas to stars in the galaxy proposed by @xcite",
    "may explain this . at a stellar dispersion of @xmath233  ( ) @xmath146 , which corresponds to a2- to a5-type stars with colors @xmath234 and characteristic main - sequence lifetimes of @xmath127  gy",
    ", the stars join the asymmetric drift .",
    "as stars continue to age , their orbits are progressively `` randomized '' and they ( again ) become part of a slower orbiting population , which appears as a larger apparent .",
    "parallaxes measurements alone generally can not yield  ( except for a parallax of ) . however , since galaxies rotate in a fairly smooth fashion , a kinematic model can be directly compared with distance and relative motion measurements in order to estimate  and . in this paper , we have demonstrated that parallax and proper motion measurements for hmsfrs across large portions of the galaxy can separate estimates of  and , although because of the somewhat restricted coverage of the galaxy currently available , we have a significant correlation between these parameters .",
    "our best estimate of  is @xmath235  kpc , where the second uncertainty is systematic and comes from our lack of detailed knowledge of the rotation curve of the galaxy .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the `` best ''  of @xmath236  kpc from a combination of many methods reviewed by @xcite .",
    "also , recent _ direct _ estimates of  from radial velocities and elliptical paths of stars that orbit  have converged on values of @xmath237  kpc @xcite and @xmath238 @xcite .",
    "( these estimates assume that  is nearly motionless at the galactic center . relaxing this assumption decreases the estimates to about 8.0  kpc . ) of course , many other less direct estimates of  can be found in the literature and span a much greater range .",
    "the characteristic rotation speed of the galaxy ( ) is a crucial parameter not only for galactic dynamics and kinematic distance determinations , but also for estimating the total mass in dark matter and the history and fate of the local group of galaxies @xcite .",
    "estimates of the rotation speed of the galaxy from the recent literature span a very large range between 184  @xcite and 272  @xcite .",
    "most estimates of  are based on analyses of the shear and vorticity of large samples of stars in the ( extended ) solar neighborhood and thus really measure oort s a and b parameters .",
    "quoted values of  then come by _ assuming _ a value for  and using the relation @xmath239 .",
    "our result that @xmath3  was obtained by fitting for both  and  using full 3-dimensional locations and motions of sources well beyond the extended solar neighborhood and , thus , does not assume a value for .",
    "however , as discussed in ",
    "[ sect : gal_model ] , with the present distribution of sources there is considerable correlation between  and  parameters , which is reflected in the @xmath167  formal uncertainty for .    our estimate of the ratio @xmath4 of @xmath5  is determined more accurately than either parameter individually and is nearly independent of the value of  over the range of likely values between about 8.0 and 8.5  kpc . this value differs considerably from that determined from the iau values of @xmath240  and differs marginally from the @xcite analysis of hipparcos cepheids of @xmath241  .",
    "recent studies , using samples of ob - type stars within 3  kpc of the sun ( excluding gould s belt stars and based on hipparcos data augmented with photometrically determined distances ) , arrive at @xmath242 between 30  @xcite and 32   @xcite , with uncertainties of about @xmath243  .",
    "our value for @xmath4 is in excellent agreement with that determined directly from the _ apparent _ proper motion of sgr  a * ( the supermassive black hole at the galactic center ) of @xmath244  @xcite .",
    "one expects a supermassive black hole to be stationary at the dynamical center of the galaxy to better than @xmath127  @xcite .",
    "hence , sgr  a * s _ apparent _ motion should be dominated by the effects of the galactic orbit of the sun . after correcting for the solar motion of 5.25  in the direction of galactic rotation @xcite , sgr",
    "a * s apparent motion yields a global estimate of @xmath245  .",
    "thus , there is excellent agreement between this and our global and direct method for measuring @xmath4 .",
    "coupling the  motion result of @xmath245  with estimates of  from stellar orbits in the galactic center @xcite of @xmath237  kpc yields @xmath246  .",
    "this result is also a direct and global measurement of @xmath247 and is independent of our result from parallaxes and proper motions of star forming regions . combining the galactic center and star forming region estimates gives @xmath248  .",
    "it seems clear that  is near the upper end of the range of estimates in the literature .",
    "we note that both the galactic center stellar orbit and the star forming region parallax results assume the hipparcos solar motion of @xmath249  in the direction of galactic rotation .",
    "only if the interpretation of the asymmetric drift is incorrect or if the entire solar neighborhood orbits the galactic center @xmath250   slower than the galaxy spins could @xmath247 be equal to the iau recommended value of 220  .",
    "we have determined the rotation speed of the milky way at the radius of the sun to be @xmath251  and the rotation curve to be nearly flat or slightly rising with distance from the galactic center .",
    "these values are nearly identical to those of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) as shown in figure  [ fig : andromeda ] .",
    "the rotation curve of andromeda , determined from hi emission by @xcite based on interferometric observations of @xcite , indicates a speed of 251  at a radius of 8  kpc , a slightly rising curve out to about 15  kpc , and a slow dropoff to about 225  beyond 20  kpc .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the similarities of the rotation curves for the milky way and andromeda is that these two galaxies are nearly equal in size and mass .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite placed a strong upper limit of @xmath252   for the component of peculiar motion of  _ perpendicular _ to the plane of the galaxy . however , the determination of the component in the direction of galactic rotation was considerably less accurate : @xmath253  , as one must remove the uncertain effects of the solar orbit .",
    "reid & brunthaler did this by removing @xmath241  , based on hipparcos measurements of oort s constants ( @xmath242 ) by @xcite , from the observed motion of sgr  a * in the galactic plane of 29.45  .",
    "this method assumes that @xmath254 and that estimates of the shear and vorticity of nearby stars from hipparcos data indicate the large - scale differential rotation of the galaxy and are not subject to local irregularities in the solar neighborhood .",
    "since we now have a direct , global estimate of @xmath163  , we find the peculiar motion of  in the direction of galactic rotation to be @xmath255  , with little sensitivity to  ( adopted to be 8.5  kpc here ) .",
    "this adds additional strong evidence that  is a supermassive black hole , which is nearly stationary at the dynamical center of the galaxy .",
