    "to date , some @xmath12 damped lyman - alpha ( dla ) absorption systems have been identified in the spectra of high - redshift qsos .",
    "the observed absorption troughs indicate concentrations of neutral gas , with large hi column densities , @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "there is considerable evidence that these objects are associated with the progenitors of present  day galaxies .",
    "this has been confirmed in several cases by direct imaging of qso fields ( steidel et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1996 ; djorgovski et al . 1996",
    "; le brun et al . 1996 ) .",
    "there are various indications that dlas are associated with young galaxies .",
    "the abundances of metals at low ionization stages in dlas are comparable to those found in disk galaxies ( wolfe 1995 ) .",
    "the metal absorption line profiles show a leading  edge asymmetry ( wolfe 1995 ; prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) and are shifted relative to the ly@xmath15 emission redshift ( lu , sargent , & barlow 1997 ) , as expected from a rotating thick disk with circular velocities comparable to those seen in spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , observations of redshifted 21-cm absorption and emission from dlas indicate disk - like structures of galactic dimensions ( briggs et al . 1989 ; wolfe et al . 1992 ) .",
    "however , recent hst images ( le brun et al .",
    "1996 ) have revealed that dla galaxies span a wide range of morphological types .",
    "the existence of a substantial galaxy population at redshifts @xmath16 is consistent with most cdm models , which predict that galaxies should form by @xmath17 ( frenk et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) .    the hi column densities in dlas can be derived from the equivalent widths of the observed absorption features .",
    "the mean hi column density along a random line of sight may then be summed up and divided by the absorption path length probed to obtain the comoving spatial hi mass density @xmath18 in galaxies at a given redshift . since dlas dominate the hi mass in the universe ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) , their statistics can be used to infer the evolution of the comoving hi density from high redshifts up to the present epoch .",
    "recent work ( lanzetta et al . 1995 ; wolfe et al . 1995 ; storrie - lombardi , mcmahon , & irwin 1996 ) has shown that , for universes with a zero cosmological constant ( @xmath19 ) , the inferred comoving total gas density @xmath20 ( including hi and he ) at a redshift @xmath21 is comparable to the stellar mass density observed in present  day galaxies .",
    "this was seen to be consistent with a simple `` closed",
    " box '' picture in which galaxies had formed by @xmath22 , and the neutral gas was subsequently converted into stars , while the total baryonic mass ( gas + stars ) is conserved .",
    "note that the closed - box model does not assume that the baryonic masses of individual galaxies are conserved but rather that the total baryonic mass of _ all _ galaxies is not evolving with time .",
    "this model allows for mergers which conserve the total mass of all of the galaxies involved .",
    "evolutionary models may be generalized to include a net infall of gas from the intergalactic medium , or a net outflow of gas from dla galaxies .",
    "the closed - box assumption represents the simplest evolutionary model , but in general we do not expect the total baryonic mass in galaxies to be conserved . in particular , the intracluster medium ( icm ) in rich clusters of galaxies contains an amount of iron which is approximately equal to the amount locked in stars in these clusters ( renzini et al .",
    "1993 ; loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "the natural explanation is that the metals observed in the icm were produced inside of galaxies and subsequently expelled into the icm by supernova  driven winds . in this paper",
    ", we examine whether the dla data are consistent with the substantial outflow needed to account for this observation .    in the subsequent discussion ,",
    "we also allow @xmath23 , and explore the family of models with @xmath24 , where @xmath3 and @xmath1 are the mean present  day cosmic mass densities in matter and vacuum energy , respectively , in units of the critical density .",
    "the absorption path length corresponding to a given redshift interval depends on the assumed cosmological model ; it is shortest for flat , @xmath19 universes , longer for open , @xmath19 universes , and longer still for flat , @xmath23 models .",
    "because the absorption path length is longest for @xmath25dominated cosmologies , we expect the inferred value of @xmath26 at high redshifts to be the smallest , and hence the deficit with respect to the present  day stellar density to be the largest in these cosmologies .",
    "this approach is similar to methods which constrain @xmath1 based on the statistics of gravitational lensing ( kochanek 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "in closed  box models , one may investigate the constraints that can be placed on @xmath1 by requiring , for some suitably chosen @xmath27 , that @xmath28 be comparable to the present - day mass density in stars , @xmath29 .",
    "however , a net infall of gas between the high - redshift epoch and @xmath30 can bring the dla data into reasonable agreement with high@xmath25 cosmologies . for our purposes , it is sufficient to parameterize the amount of accretion or expulsion as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the total baryonic density in galaxies , and @xmath33 .",
    "in this paper we explore the constraints on both galaxy evolution and cosmology by constructing confidence regions in the @xmath34 plane . to simplify our analysis",
    ", we make the reasonable assumption that the distribution of dlas in hi column density @xmath35 and redshift @xmath36 , @xmath37 , is separable into functions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 over a suitably small redshift interval .",
    "this allows us to fit the column density distribution separately from the extraction of constraints on galaxy formation or the underlying cosmology [ the latter being exclusively related to the redshift dependence of @xmath37 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is calculated by multiplying the local luminosity density by the mean mass - to - light ratio .",
    "recent imaging of dla galaxies ( le brun et al .",
    "1996 ) indicates that , while some are spirals , a significant fraction of these objects have irregular morphologies , which may indicate that a substantial amount of merging was taking place at high redshifts .",
    "since mergers may result in the formation of elliptical galaxies , we include all galaxy types in our calculation of the local luminosity density , and hence @xmath29 .",
    "the assumption that underlies our discussion is that star formation requires _ cold _ hi gas , which must be represented in a fair sample of all ly@xmath15 absorption systems , irrespective of whether the star formation process occurs in spirals or in ellipticals .    in  2.1",
    "we show how the comoving hi density is inferred from the dla sample , and how sensitive it is to the underlying cosmology .",
    "section 2.2 adds the impact that evolution in the hi content of galaxies might have on our analysis . in ",
    "3 we discuss the statistical methods used to compare the data to the theoretical predictions for @xmath28 . in  4 we present the derived confidence intervals for our constraints on the evolution of galaxies and the cosmological constant . finally , ",
    "5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in order to extract useful constraints from the data , we must predict some observable property of the dla sample , and show explicitly how our prediction depends on our assumptions about cosmology and evolution . in  2.1 , we show how , for a given cosmology , the comoving hi density @xmath39 is related to the total dla column density along a line of sight . in  2.2 , we introduce a parameter which characterizes the amount of evolution in the hi density .",
    "the comoving hi density in dla systems at a redshift @xmath36 is inferred by calculating the mean hi column density in a proper length interval @xmath40 along a line of sight , and dividing the result by @xmath41 .",
    "since the absorption path length element @xmath42 corresponding to a given redshift element @xmath43 depends on the cosmological parameters @xmath44 ( the mean present - day cosmic mass densities in matter and vacuum energy , respectively , in units of the critical density ) , the inferred value of the comoving hi density will depend on the assumed geometry of the universe .",
    "let @xmath45 be the mean number of dlas along a line of sight with hi column densities between @xmath35 and @xmath46 and redshifts between @xmath36 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath37 is different from the function @xmath48 usually encountered in the literature ; the latter is conventionally defined such that @xmath49 gives the number of dlas with with column densities between @xmath35 and @xmath46 and absorption distances between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the inferred comoving hi density is given by @xmath52 \\int_{n_{\\rm min}}^ \\infty f(n , z)ndn , \\label{eq : rhomean}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , and @xmath54 @xmath14 is the minimum hi column density included in the sample . for a cosmological model with density parameters ( @xmath44 ) and an open or flat geometry ,",
    "the absorption path length element @xmath42 is given by @xmath55    for a flat matter  dominated universe with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; for a low  density universe with @xmath59 and @xmath57 , @xmath60 ; and for a flat , @xmath25dominated universe with @xmath59 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "hence , because the path length corresponding to a given redshift interval @xmath43 is longest for @xmath25dominated cosmologies , the @xmath63 value inferred from equation  ( [ eq : rhomean ] ) is smallest for large @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we will only consider the family of flat cosmologies with @xmath64 , and will write all cosmology  dependent expressions in terms of the single adjustable parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the _ observed _ distribution @xmath65 , defined as the _ total _ number of dlas observed in the sample with column densities between @xmath35 and @xmath46 and redshifts between @xmath36 and @xmath47 , depends on the sensitivity of the qso sample to the detection of a dla feature at redshift @xmath36 . in the absence of obscuration of background qsos by dust in the dlas , @xmath66 where @xmath67 here , @xmath68 the heaviside step function , @xmath69 is the total number of qsos in the sample , and @xmath70 is the redshift window over which the observations are able to detect a dla feature in the spectrum of the @xmath71th qso ( depending on the redshift of the qso and the response of the detector ) .",
    "thus , @xmath72 is the number of lines of sight for which a dla feature is detectable at an absorber redshift @xmath36 .",

    "solutions which include accretion or outflow have been identified by pei & fall ( 1995 ) for the case where @xmath88 .    for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that @xmath26 is constant within a sufficiently narrow redshift interval around @xmath5 .",
    "although the minimum width of this interval is limited to @xmath8912 by the current size of the dla sample , one can imagine that forthcoming dla surveys will allow one to narrow it much more in the future . in principle",
    ", one could have considered the case of a constant nonzero rate of change @xmath90 ; however , even with @xmath8912 this produces results which do not differ appreciably from the case where @xmath26 is a constant , for a range of reasonable values of @xmath91 .",
    "any deficit in the gas density @xmath28 at @xmath5 relative to the total present  day baryonic mass @xmath92 will be due to a combination of two effects : ( 1 ) some material may have accreted onto existing galaxies or assembled into new galaxies since @xmath5 , and ( 2 ) some star formation may have already occurred by redshift @xmath5 , depleting part of the gas . effect ( 2 ) is expected to be sub ",
    "dominant based on the low metallicities @xmath93 observed at redshifts @xmath16 ( lu et al .",
    "1996 ) and the relatively small star formation rates observed at such high redshifts ( madau 1996 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we will lump the two effects together , and will parameterize the combined contribution to the deficit by defining @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the fraction of @xmath96 which was present at a redshift of 3 .",
    "( we choose @xmath5 as the fiducial redshift for the comparison , but since we assume that @xmath26=constant over an interval containing @xmath5 , we could just as easily choose any other redshift in this interval for the definition of @xmath4 . ) hence , @xmath97 corresponds to a net accretion and @xmath98 corresponds to a net expulsion of material since @xmath5 .",
    "star formation prior to @xmath5 is expected to produce at most @xmath9925% of @xmath29 ( approximately the fractional area under the the curve @xmath100 inferred from madau 1996 , corrected for high-@xmath25 cosmologies ) .",
    "let @xmath101 be the fraction of the total present - day mass in stars which were produced by @xmath0 ; then , with @xmath33 , we have @xmath102    finally , we neglect the contributions of ionized hydrogen , molecular hydrogen ( see ge & bechtold 1997 ) , as well as metals , to @xmath26 at redshifts @xmath16 , but include helium , 25% by mass , resulting in a mean molecular weight of 1.3@xmath53 .",
    "we therefore use @xmath103 .",
    "next we describe the methods used to compare the data to the model prediction @xmath39 for the mean hi density at high redshift , at given values of @xmath4 and @xmath1 . in  3.1 , we construct the likelihood function , and in  3.2 , we use bayesian analysis to derive confidence regions in the ( @xmath104 ) plane from the likelihood function .",
    "the likelihood function gives the probability of obtaining a particular data set , assuming the truth of a specified model .",
    "the model should include predictions for both the expected value of the quantity in question and the _ distribution _ of measurements due to statistical ( e.g. poisson ) fluctuations about the expected value .",
    "the most commonly used likelihood estimator in the literature is the @xmath105 statistic , which is simply proportional to the logarithm of the likelihood function for normally distributed errors .",
    "its widespread use is due to two convenient facts : the tendency , due to the central limit theorem , of sums of many random variables to be normally distributed ; and the fact that the distribution of the @xmath105 statistic for normally distributed errors is known , which makes it easy to calculate confidence regions .",
    "however , the @xmath105 statistic is not appropriate for our analysis here . to apply the @xmath105 statistic",
    ", we would need to collect the data into redshift bins , and estimate the value of @xmath18 in each bin by summing up the column densities and dividing by the total absorption path length probed in the bin .",
    "however , given our small sample size ( only 73 objects in total ) , such experimentally - measured values of @xmath18 will not be normally distributed .",
    "in fact , the values we measured from monte - carlo - simulated data sets show a significant skewness in their distribution , and so we are not justified in using the @xmath105 statistic to calculate confidence regions",
    ". moreover , this approach introduces arbitrariness in the choice of bin size and also loses information about the dla sample by binning the data .",
    "we have therefore chosen to construct a likelihood function which makes use of the _ unbinned _ data , and which does not rely on the assumption of normally distributed errors .",
    "the starting point for constructing our likelihood function is to note that any prediction for @xmath39 can be related to the observed distribution of dlas in column density and redshift using equation  ( [ eq : rhotot ] ) .",
    "since we assume that @xmath39 is approximately constant over some narrow redshift interval around @xmath5 , we may use equation  ( [ eq : rhog ] ) , and rearrange  ( [ eq : rhotot ] ) to write @xmath106 { \\ } \\rho_{\\rm s0}(1+\\eta - f ) , \\label{eq : fndn}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 .",
    "thus , given an evolution model @xmath39 and a cosmological model @xmath1 , we have a definite prediction for a property of the dla sample , namely the total column density as a function of redshift [ given by the left hand side of equation  ( [ eq : fndn ] ) ] .",
    "note that  ( [ eq : fndn ] ) gives the _ expected _ value of this quantity ; it is not obvious how the values measured from hypothetical data sets should be distributed about this expected value ( as mentioned above , given the small sample size , the values in each redshift bin will not be normally distributed ) .",
    "specifically , the distribution of measured @xmath39 values depends on the shape of @xmath108 as a function of hi column density @xmath35 , and will be skewed toward smaller values if @xmath108 is dominated by low@xmath35 systems , and vice - versa .",
    "unfortunately , our evolution models @xmath39 predict only the first moment of @xmath108 , not the distribution itself .",
    "however , the dla sample _ does _ tell us something about the full distribution ; in particular , the entire sample is well  fitted by a so  called gamma distribution ( storrie - lombardi , irwin , & mcmahon 1996 ) : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are functions of @xmath36 and @xmath112const .",
    "if we specialize to the case where @xmath111 is a constant , then @xmath110 contains all of the @xmath36dependence , and is proportional to @xmath113 ( i.e. , all of the redshift dependence is due to the cosmological geometry ) . in this case , we may rewrite equation  ( [ eq : fndn ] ) as @xmath114{\\ } \\rho_{\\rm s0}(1+\\eta - f),\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : fdn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the mean column density in the distribution , with @xmath116 the incomplete gamma function .",
    "note that equation  ( [ eq : fdn ] ) , with @xmath117 independent of redshift , applies for _ any _ distribution @xmath118 which is separable into functions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the assumption of separability is particularly appealing if only a small fraction of the available hi is depleted from dla galaxies during the redshift range under consideration . suppressing the dependence on @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and @xmath119 for brevity ,",
    "the quantity @xmath120 defined in equation  ( [ eq : fdn ] ) denotes the redshift distribution of absorbers ; the number of systems observed with redshifts between @xmath36 and @xmath47 is @xmath121 .    for the moment , assume that we know the _ shape _ of @xmath108 a priori , and hence that we know @xmath117 from equation  ( [ eq : navg ] ) .",
    "[ we will address the question of how to incorporate properly our incomplete knowledge of @xmath108 from the data into our analysis in the next section .",

    "we include all galaxy types in our calculation of @xmath139 , with the assumptions that spiral galaxies are well described by maximal ",
    "disk models , and that spiral and elliptical galaxies have the same stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we take the mass - to - light ratio for sbc galaxies as typical for all galaxy types of the same luminosity .",
    "our approach overestimates the stellar mass - to - light ratio somewhat if , as some studies suggest ( rix et al .",
    "1997 ) , the dark matter accounts for a significant fraction of the total mass in the inner regions of galaxies . using equation  ( [ eq : rhos ] ) , we obtain @xmath171 based on the uncertainty in @xmath160 , we assume that the values of @xmath139 are normally distributed with a variance @xmath172 .",
    "the observed column density distribution of dla systems , and hence the inferred value of @xmath18 , is affected by the presence of dust in the dla galaxies ( fall & pei 1993 ) .",
    "the dust obscures background qsos , and causes incompleteness in the dla sample .",
    "the presence of dust leads to an underestimate of @xmath18 from the data ; accounting for this fact will lead to better agreement between data and predictions for high-@xmath25 cosmologies .",
    "fall & pei ( 1993 ) showed that the true column density distribution is given by @xmath173 , \\label{eq : ftrue}\\ ] ] where @xmath174 is the power - law slope at the bright end of the qso luminosity function [ @xmath175 , and @xmath176 is the extinction optical depth , given by @xmath177 here , @xmath178 is the dimensionless dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath179 is the extinction curve , and @xmath180 is the effective wavelength of the band of the qso survey . we have used equations  ( [ eq : ftrue ] ) and  ( [ eq : taudef ] ) , together with an assumption that the observed distribution @xmath108 may be fit by a gamma distribution  ( [ eq : gammadist ] ) , and that @xmath181 is proportional to the metallicity , to estimate the correction to the expected value of @xmath39 due to dust obscuration .",
    "following pei & fall ( 1995 ) , we assume that @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 for qso surveys in the @xmath185-band .",
    "we assume that the metallicity at redshifts @xmath0 is approximately one - tenth of the solar value , @xmath186 .",
    "we find that the effect of dust is to reduce the inferred value of @xmath18 by a factor of @xmath187 .",
    "our results in the next section will include this correction .",
    "we have applied equation  ( [ eq : bayesc ] ) , corrected for dust extinction , to the dla sample for two redshift ranges , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , allowing @xmath190 , @xmath191 . to compute the prior distribution @xmath146 ,",
    "we first fit a gamma - distribution  ( [ eq : gammadist ] ) to the data , and use bayesian methods similar to those described in  3.2 to obtain a probability distribution @xmath192 .",
    "we fix @xmath110 by requiring that the integral of @xmath108 over all column densities be equal to the total number @xmath129 of dlas observed in the narrow redshift interval under consideration .",
    "we then obtain a cumulative probability distribution for @xmath119 by integrating numerically the probability @xmath192 inside contours of constant @xmath117 in the @xmath193 plane , given by equation  ( [ eq : navg ] ) .",
    "we differentiate this cumulative distribution numerically to obtain the differential distribution @xmath146 .",
    "finally , we use equations  ( [ eq : fdn ] ) and  ( [ eq : likeb ] ) to obtain the likelihood function @xmath152 . substituting these results into equation  ( [ eq : bayesc ] )",
    "gives the differential probability distribution @xmath150 .",
    "confidence regions are obtained by integrating this distribution inside contours of constant @xmath150 .",
    "our results do not depend strongly on the value of the hubble constant ; we assume @xmath194 km s@xmath157 mpc@xmath157 .    in figure 1a , we show 68% , 95% , and 99% confidence regions in the @xmath195 plane , for the redshift range @xmath188 ; figure 1b shows the same for the redshift range @xmath189 . in both cases ,",
    "we assume that 25% of the present - day mass density in stars had been assembled by @xmath11 ( @xmath196 ) , consistent with the star formation rate of madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "the effect of the sample size is evident : the 99% confidence region is 20% smaller for the larger sample ( 45 objects with @xmath188 ) than for the smaller sample ( 17 objects with @xmath189 ) .",
    "note that , for the larger sample , the data are inconsistent with a net expulsion of more than half of the gas from galaxies ( @xmath197 ) at the 99% confidence level , and also rule out @xmath198 at 95% confidence and @xmath199 at 68% , in all flat cosmologies .",
    "one may compare this result with the observational finding that the intracluster medium ( icm ) in rich clusters of galaxies contains an amount of iron which is approximately equal to the amount found in the stellar component of galaxies in these clusters ( renzini et al .",
    "1993 ; loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "the natural explanation is that the iron in the icm was produced in supernova explosions inside of galaxies , and was subsequently expelled into the icm by supernova  driven winds .",
    "if galaxies were fully assembled by a redshift @xmath200 , then they should have had twice as much baryonic material at such redshifts than is observed locally .",
    "since our analysis excludes the possibility that there was more than 1.5 ( 1.75 ) times the present  day baryonic density at 95% confidence for the larger ( smaller ) samples , it suggests that ( 1 ) infall of material into existing galaxies or formation of new galaxies has taken place since @xmath11 ; or ( 2 ) more than 25% by mass of the present - day stellar population formed by @xmath11 .",
    "these possibilities will be discussed in more depth in  5 .",
    "note also that for high@xmath1 cosmologies , outflow models are strongly ruled out , so it would be more difficult to reconcile the dla data with the intracluster iron observations in an @xmath1-dominated universe .",
    "if we wish to specialize to a particular cosmological model , we should consider the one - dimensional probability distribution @xmath201 , since the sizes of the confidence intervals decrease when the number of free parameters is reduced .",
    "figure 2a shows the probability distribution for @xmath4 , given @xmath57 ( the case corresponding to the most conservative constraints on @xmath4 ) .",
    "we consider the sample with @xmath188 .",
    "the solid curves correspond to different assumptions about the amount of star formation that took place at @xmath202 : @xmath203 , 0.25 , and 0.5 , from left to right .",
    "upper limits on @xmath4 derived from these curves are summarized in table 1 . as @xmath101 increases , the gas density observed in dlas is supplemented by more and more stars , so the data become more consistent with the closed  box model . as can be seen from figure 2a ,",
    "the data are consistent with modest to significant amounts of infall or formation of new galaxies subsequent to @xmath204 .",
    "significant expulsion is less likely ; for @xmath205 the data are inconsistent with @xmath206 at 95% confidence .",
    "if one allows for half of the present - day stellar population to form before @xmath5 , then one achieves marginal consistency with @xmath207 at 95% confidence .",
    "however , in this case the metallicity of dla systems will significantly exceed its observed value of @xmath208 at @xmath209 ( lu et al .",
    "figure 2b shows similar results for @xmath210 ; here , no significant amount of expulsion is viable . hence , it is unlikely that all of the baryonic material seen today in galaxies and the icm of rich clusters was present in dla galaxies at redshifts @xmath27 .",
    "the dotted curves in figure 2 are the results obtained by considering present - day galaxies + icm as a whole , with equal mass densities in stars and the icm .",
    "hence , we attempt to account for an amount `` @xmath96''= @xmath211 .",
    "we assume that 25% of the present - day mass in stars + enriched icm ( that is , 0.5@xmath139 ) was present in the form of stars by @xmath11 .",
    "clearly , only about half of this amount was present in dla galaxies at @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) ; the rest of it must have assembled into galaxies ( and some of it subsequently expelled ) after @xmath11 .",
    "this possibility will be discussed further in  5 .",
    "the constraints obtained with our method will improve as the catalog of dla systems grows .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey , which is getting underway in 1997 ( gunn & knapp 1993 ; see also http://www.astro.princeton.edu/bbook ) , will catalog @xmath212 quasars , at least an order of magnitude more than the number discovered to date ( loveday 1996 ) .",
    "spectroscopic follow - ups on this sample could increase the dla sample size by 12 orders of magnitude . in figure 3",
    ", we predict the effect on our results of a more modest increase in the dla sample size .",
    "figure 3a indicates how the probability distribution @xmath213 changes when the sample size @xmath129 with @xmath189 is increased by a factor of 2 or 5 . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we choose @xmath57 and @xmath196 .",
    "we take into account the observational uncertainty @xmath214 in the present  day stellar density @xmath139 , and assume that the additional dlas have the same column density distribution as the existing sample . in this case",
    "it is a simple analytical matter to determine @xmath213 for a hypothetically larger data set .",
    "the trend is obvious : as more data are acquired , our measurement of @xmath4 becomes more precise , and @xmath213 becomes more sharply peaked .",
    "given our assumptions , the mean value of @xmath4 will remain constant , but the confidence intervals will shrink . for the case shown in figure 3a , the 95% upper bound on @xmath4 is 0.32 , 0.10 , and -0.08 , respectively , for @xmath215 , 34 , and 85 . in reality , the mean value of @xmath4 will shift around as the column density distribution becomes better known [ i.e. @xmath119 in equation  ( [ eq : navg ] ) will not remain constant as observations improve ] , but the width of @xmath213 will still behave in the same way .",
    "the precision with which we can measure @xmath4 is limited by the 25% uncertainty in @xmath139 .",
    "figure 3b demonstrates what would happen if @xmath139 were known exactly . in this case , the statistics are purely poisson and the width ( and hence the height ) of our normalized distribution scales as @xmath216 .",
    "we have used the catalog of dla systems to place constraints on the amount of evolution in the baryonic content of galaxies and the value of the cosmological constant .",
    "we compared the gas density @xmath26 at redshift @xmath0 to the present  day stellar mass density @xmath217 in galaxies for a range of flat cosmologies with @xmath218 .",
    "our underlying assumption is that cold gas is required for star formation .",
    "we make use of the facts that dla systems dominate the hi content of the universe at redshifts @xmath27 and the correction to their baryonic mass due to molecular gas is small , @xmath219% ( ge & bechtold 1997 ) .",
    "we defined @xmath4 to be the net fraction of the baryonic content of local galaxies which was expelled since @xmath220 , and used bayesian inference to derive confidence regions in the ( @xmath6 ) plane . in all cosmologies",
    "we find that @xmath7 with at least 95% confidence , as long as only @xmath9 of the current stellar population formed before @xmath5 .",
    "the most likely value of @xmath4 is negative ( cf .",
    "2 ) , implying a net _ increase _ by several tens of percent in the baryonic mass of galaxies since @xmath204 .",
    "the inferred value of @xmath4 is more extreme for @xmath1dominated cosmologies . on the other hand , recent observations of high metal abundances in the intracluster medium of rich clusters ( renzini et al .",
    "1993 ; loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) require that metal ",
    "rich gas be _ expelled _ from galaxies in an amount approximately equal to the current mass in stars .",
    "the possibility that a dominant fraction of the present  day stellar population may have already formed by @xmath5 and resulted early on in this expulsion , is ruled out by the low metalicities ( @xmath221@xmath222 solar ) observed in dlas at @xmath223 ( lu et al .",
    "moreover , the intergalactic medium which later accretes onto clusters of galaxies has a metallicity as low as @xmath224 solar at @xmath209 ( cowie  et  al .",
    "1995 ; tytler  et  al .",
    "1995 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ; cowie 1996 ) , rather than the needed value of @xmath225 solar .",
    "most of the required metal enrichment and star formation activity must therefore have occurred at @xmath226 .",
    "the most likely explanation to the above discrepancy is that a significant amount of gas had been assembled and partly expelled from galaxies after @xmath11 .",
    "the increase in galactic mass could have been either in the form of accretion onto existing galaxies or through the formation of new galaxies , such as those responsible for the faint excess in deep galaxy counts ( lowenthal et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) . the likely value of @xmath4 of minus several tenths ( fig .",
    "2 ) , implies that more than half the associated baryonic mass was processed through galaxies after @xmath11 . as an example , let us assume that @xmath227 at @xmath0 , and that 150% of the current baryonic mass of galaxies had assembled after @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that the total mass processed through galaxies is twice ( 150%+50% ) their current mass , as required by the observation that clusters contain twice the iron locked up in stars ( renzini et al .",
    "1993 ; elbaz , arnaud , & vangioni - flam 1995 ; lowenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "half of the processed mass was converted into galactic stars and half expelled into the intergalactic medium . if the expelled gas is @xmath228 of the intergalactic gas it mixed with [ assuming @xmath229 and the value of @xmath217 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhosvalue ] ) ] , then it could have yielded the @xmath230 solar metallicity observed in clusters as long as its original metallicity was a few times solar .",
    "the phase of massive metal enrichment must have occurred at @xmath2312 since the iron abundance in clusters shows little evolution at @xmath232 ( mushotzky & lowenstein 1997 ) .",
    "this inference could be tested observationally through a dedicated search for enhanced star formation activity and supernova rate at @xmath2312 .",
    "we have employed a bayesian analysis which has the dual advantages of taking the various observational uncertainties properly into account , and making use of unbinned data .",
    "the constraints obtained with our method will improve as the size of the quasar sample increases ( cf .",
    "3 ) . in particular , future spectroscopic observations of the @xmath212 quasars cataloged by the sloan digital sky survey ( http://www.astro.princeton.edu/bbook ) , could increase the current sample size of dlas by 12 orders of magnitude , and improve our limits on the amount of galactic evolution considerably .",
