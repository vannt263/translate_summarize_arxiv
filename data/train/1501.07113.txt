    "the electron flow in semiconductor nanostructures containing a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) buried shallow beneath the surface of the structure can be probed by a charged tip of an atomic force microscope .",
    "the technique , known as the scanning gate microscopy @xcite ( sgm ) , gathers conductance maps as functions of the position of the tip that is capacitively coupled to the electron gas . for 2deg confined in bulk semiconductors the maps are used to extract electron trajectories @xcite , branching of the electron flow via quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) @xcite , many - body phenomena @xcite , aharonov - bohm effects @xcite and scarred wave functions in quantum billiards @xcite as well as the interference effects @xcite due to backscattering by the tip . the sgm technique has also been used @xcite for graphene with the electron gas remaining strictly on the surface of the structure . in particular , sgm technique was applied in studies of charge inhomogeneities@xcite , charging localized states formed within a widening of the nanoribbons @xcite and at potential constrictions @xcite , universal conductance fluctuations @xcite and weak localization effects @xcite .",
    "very recently a sgm study of the graphene quantum rings was reported @xcite with conductance fringes as due to resonant localized states .",
    "quantum point contacts are basic elements of the quantum transport circuitry allowing for the current injection and detection , control of the number of conducting of modes , etc .",
    "the conductance quantization for qpcs defined within the bulk semiconductors is usually observed for electrostatic potentials @xcite controlling the width of the constriction . for graphene systems",
    "this approach is rather excluded , since the klein tunneling @xcite and perfectly conducting channels @xcite in graphene nanoribbons lead to a low effectiveness of electrostatic confinement and backscattering , allowing the dirac electrons to pass across potential barriers @xcite .",
    "the qpcs are therefore formed by tailoring constrictions @xcite of the nanoribbons @xcite .",
    "the ineffectiveness of backscattering in graphene seems reflected by the results of the experimental sgm studies of the quantum point contacts ( qpc ) @xcite which find flat conductance maps outside the qpc @xcite in a distinct contrast to the results obtained for bulk semiconductor in which interference fringes due to the backscattering by the tip and the resulting formation of standing wave between the qpc and the probe are clearly observed @xcite .",
    "the scanning gate microscopy was used @xcite for detection of spontaneous quantum dots formed along the disordered ribbon within the transport gap @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to determine the response of graphene quantum point contacts formed by constrictions of the nanoribbons to the scanning probe [ fig .",

    "we consider systems of perfect armchair or zigzag edges  and systems varying with atomic - step edges , as can be produced with the joule heating technique @xcite .",
    "for pristine graphene ribbons @xcite the edge determines the character of the ribbon ( semiconducting or semimetallic ) and the ribbons with boundaries other than armchair have the transport properties similar to the zigzag edges @xcite . for the purpose of the present study",
    "we develop an implementation of the quantum transmitting boundary @xcite method for the solution of the coherent transport problem set by scattering solution of the schrdinger equation for the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "we study both the effects of the local potential variation induced by the tip on edge - localized states and the effects of backscattering within the constrictions .",
    "for qpcs the scattering induced by disorder @xcite and the inhomogeneity of the edges @xcite destroy the conductance quantization which can still be observed @xcite for mesoscopically smooth boundaries @xcite of the constriction . as compared to qpcs , we find that an asymmetric narrowing , i.e. a contact between nanoribbons of varied width , exhibits a very clear conductance quantization as a function of the fermi energy , also when the edges are not smooth at the mesoscopic scale .",
    "we study quantum point contacts and find that for short constrictions there is a flat minimum of conductance for the tip above the constriction in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "generally , for any tip potential we find that outside the graphene constrictions the variation of the conductance by the tip potential is not pronounced as in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite . for longer constrictions",
    "however a regular formation of the standing waves occurs which  according to the present study ",
    "should be resolved by the scanning gate microscopy .",
    "the resonant states localized at armchair - zigzag connections at ribbon constrictions formed by atomic steps @xcite induce a strong backscattering .",
    "these resonant states quench the conductance to zero at low energy .",
    "we find that the charge transport can be unblocked by the potential of the probe which neutralizes the scattering centers , with conductance maps forming halos similar to those found in the coulomb blockade experiment of ref .",
    "the response for homogenous nanoribbons to the probe potential at low fermi energies is determined by the existence of perfectly conducting channels ( metallic armchair and zigzag ribbons ) , as well as by formation of local n - p junctions at the edges ( zigzag ribbons ) .",

    "<S> the qpcs containing a long constriction support formation of localized resonances which induce a system of conductance peaks that is reentrant in the fermi energy , with the form of the probability density that can be resolved by the conductance mapping . for shorter constrictions </S>",
    "<S> the probe induces smooth conductance minima within the constrictions . in general , besides the low - energy transport gap , in the wider parts of the ribbon the variation of the conductance of the system is low compared to the narrower part . </S>"
