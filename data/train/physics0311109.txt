    "<S> results of molecular dynamics simulations of fission reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are presented . </S>",
    "<S> dependence of the fission barriers on isomer structure of the parent cluster is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the energy necessary for removing homothetic groups of atoms from the parent cluster is largely independent of the isomer form of the parent cluster . </S>",
    "<S> importance of rearrangement of the cluster structure during the fission process is elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> this rearrangement may include transition to another isomer state of the parent cluster before actual separation of the daughter fragments begins and/or forming a `` neck '' between the separating fragments .    </S>",
    "<S> fission of charged atomic clusters occurs when repulsive coulomb forces , arising due to the excessive charge , overcome the electronic binding energy of the cluster @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism of the cluster fission is in a great deal similar to the nuclear fission phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , multiply charged metal clusters can be observed in the mass spectra when their size exceeds the critical size of stability , which depends on the metal species and cluster charge @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we report the results of the _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the fission processes @xmath0 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> both symmetric and asymmetric fission channels are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the parent cluster isomer dependence of the fission barrier for the reaction @xmath0 . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> a comparative study of fission barriers for various isomers by means of quantum chemistry methods has not been carried out before . </S>",
    "<S> note that such a study is beyond the scope of simpler approaches which do not account for ionic structure of a cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that the direct separation barrier for the reaction @xmath3 has a weak dependence on the isomeric structure of the parent cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that the groups of atoms to be removed from the parent cluster isomers must be chosen with care ; one has to identify homothetic groups of atoms in each fissioning isomer . </S>",
    "<S> the weak dependence on the isomeric state of the parent @xmath4 cluster implies that the particular ionic structure of the cluster is largely insignificant for the shape and height of the fission barrier . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the maximum of fission barriers in considered cases are located at distances comparable or exceeding the sum of the resulting fragments radii . at such distances </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the fragments , apart from the coulombic repulsion , is mainly determined by the electronic properties rather than by the details of the ionic structure of the fragments . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important argument for justification of the jellium model approach to the description of the fission process of multiply charged metal clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the importance of rearrangement of the cluster ionic structure during the fission process . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of rearrangement of the cluster structure leads to the fact that direct fission of a cluster isomer in some cases may not be the energetically optimum path for the fission reaction . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the reaction can go through transition to another isomer state of the parent cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this transition can occur in the first phase of the fission process , before separation of the fragments actually begins . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this is the case for the fission of @xmath5 and @xmath6 isomers of @xmath4 cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the rearrangement of ionic structure may be important also after the fragments began to separate . for @xmath1 reaction , two magic fragments @xmath7 form a metastable transitional state in which the fragments are connected by a `` neck '' . </S>",
    "<S> this `` necking '' allows for significant reduction in the height of the fission barrier . </S>",
    "<S> note that the similar necking phenomenon is known for the nuclear fission process @xcite .    in our molecular dynamics simulations we utilize methods of density </S>",
    "<S> functional theory ( dft ) . within the dft one has to solve the kohn - sham equations @xcite @xmath8 where the first term corresponds to the kinetic energy of an electron from the kohn - sham reference system </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath9 describes the attraction of the @xmath10 electron to the nuclei in the cluster , @xmath11 is the electronic orbital , @xmath12 is the hartree part of the inter - electronic interaction , @xmath13 @xmath14 is the electron density , @xmath15 is the local exchange - correlation potential defined as the functional derivative of the exchange - correlation energy functional @xmath16}{\\delta \\rho({\\bf r})},\\ ] ] where the exchange - correlation energy is partitioned into two parts , referred to as _ exchange _ and _ correlation _ parts : @xmath17= e_{\\rm x}(\\rho ) + e_{\\rm c } ( \\rho).\\ ] ] physically , these two terms correspond to same - spin and mixed - spin interactions , respectively . both parts are functionals of the electron density , which can be of two distinct types : either a local functional depending on the electron density @xmath18 only or a gradient - corrected functional depending on the electron density and its gradient @xmath19 .    there is a variety of exchange - correlation functionals in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the three - parameter becke - type gradient - corrected exchange functional with the gradient - corrected correlation functional of lee , yang , and parr ( b3lyp ) @xcite . for the explicit form of this functional we refer to the original papers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the b3lyp functional has proved to be a reliable tool for studying the structure and properties of small metal clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it provides high accuracy at comparatively low computational costs . for a discussion and a comparison with other approaches , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the density of the parent cluster and two daughter fragments ( including the overlapping region before scission point ) almost does not change during the fission process ( by analogy with the deformed jellium model , see @xcite for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the b3lyp method works adequately for any fragment separation distances , @xmath20 , during the fission process .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculations have been carried out with the use of the gaussian 98 software package @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 6 - 311g(d ) and lanl2dz basis sets of primitive gaussian functions have been used to expand the cluster orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 6 - 311g(d ) basis has been used for simulations involving @xmath4 cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this basis set takes into account electrons from all atomic orbitals , so that the dynamics of all particles in the system is taken into account . for @xmath21 cluster </S>",
    "<S> we have used more numerically efficient lanl2dz basis , for which valent atomic electrons move in an effective core potential ( see details in @xcite ) .     to simulate the fission process </S>",
    "<S> we start from the optimized geometry of a cluster ( for details of the geometry optimization procedure see @xcite ) and choose the atoms the resulting fragments would consist of . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms chosen for a smaller fragment are shifted from their locations in the parent cluster to a certain distance . </S>",
    "<S> then , the multidimensional potential energy surface , its gradient and forces with respect to the molecular coordinates are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities specify the direction along the surface in which the energy decreases the most rapidly and provide information for the determination of the next step for the moving atoms . if the fragments are removed not far enough from each other then the attractive forces prevailed over the repulsive ones and the fragments stuck together forming the unified cluster again . in the opposite situation </S>",
    "<S> the repulsive forces dominate and the fragments drift away from each other . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the total energy of the system on the fragment separation distance forms the fission barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of our simulations is to find the fission pathway corresponding to the minimum of the fission barrier .    </S>",
    "<S> there are usually many stable isomers of a cluster with energies slightly exceeding the energy of the ground state isomer . in order to analyze the isomer dependence of the fission barrier in the reaction </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 we have picked two energetically low - lying isomers with the point symmetry groups @xmath5 and @xmath6 differing from the distorted @xmath23 point symmetry group of the ground state parent @xmath4 cluster . </S>",
    "<S> three isomer states of the @xmath4 cluster are shown in figure  [ isomers ] .     cluster . from left to right : the ground state isomer of distorted @xmath24 point symmetry group ( total energy is -1622.7063 a.u . ) ; an isomer of @xmath5 point symmetry group ( total energy is -1622.6888 a.u . </S>",
    "<S> , that exceeds the lowest energy state by 0.476  ev ) ; an isomer of @xmath6 point symmetry group ( total energy is -1622.6860 a.u . </S>",
    "<S> , that exceeds the lowest energy state by 0.553  ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the homothetic group of three atoms marked by black color . ]    in figure  [ isobarriers ] we show fission barriers for separation three atoms from the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath23 isomers of the @xmath4 cluster . in this figure zero level of energy </S>",
    "<S> is chosen for each parent isomer separately and corresponds to the minimum of total energy of that isomer . </S>",
    "<S> the initial distances between the centers of mass of two ( future ) fragments are finite so that the barriers do not start at the origin .    ) from three isomers of @xmath4 cluster derived from molecular dynamics simulations ( direct @xmath0 fission channel ) . </S>",
    "<S> the barriers plotted versus distance between the centers of mass of the fragments . </S>",
    "<S> solid , dashed , and dashed - dotted lines correspond to distorted @xmath24 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 point symmetry groups isomers of the parent cluster , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> energies are measured from the energy of the ground state of the corresponding isomers , i.e. we plot @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total energy of the system and @xmath27 are the ground energies of the @xmath24 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 isomer states of the parent @xmath4 cluster , respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the barriers for all three channels are close . </S>",
    "<S> the weak sensitivity of the fission barrier on the isomeric states of the reactants can be explained if one notices that the barrier maxima are located at distances comparable to or exceeding the sum of the resulting fragments radii , that is not far from the scission point . at such distances </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the fragments , apart from coulombic repulsion , is mainly determined by the electronic properties rather than by the details of the ionic structure of the fragments . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important argument for justification of the jellium model approach to the description of the fission process of multiply charged metal clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the barriers presented in figure  [ isobarriers ] are calculated in assumption that fission occurs for the fixed ( given ) isomers . </S>",
    "<S> however , since @xmath5 and @xmath6 isomers are not the lowest energy states of @xmath4 system , there could be other processes competing with fission . </S>",
    "<S> one of such processes is rearrangement of the cluster structure . </S>",
    "<S> rearrangement of the cluster structure during the fission process may significantly reduce the fission barrier . </S>",
    "<S> such rearrangement may occur before the actual separation of the daughter fragments begins or after that .     </S>",
    "<S> system and schematic barriers for transitions between these states . </S>",
    "<S> energies are measured from the energy of the ground @xmath24 state of the @xmath4 cluster . ]     </S>",
    "<S> channel derived from molecular dynamics simulations as a function of distance between the centers of mass of the fragments . </S>",
    "<S> energy is measured from the energy of the ground @xmath28 state of the @xmath21 cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the arrow shows position of the meta - stable transitional state , see also figure  . </S>",
    "<S> this results is in a good agreement with the results of the jellium model @xcite . ]    . from left to right : ground state of the parent cluster ; `` necking '' between the two fragments leads to a meta stable intermediate state and significantly reduces the fission barrier height ; two @xmath7 fragments drifting away from each other . ]    </S>",
    "<S> fission of @xmath5 and @xmath6 isomers of @xmath4 cluster is an example of situation where rearrangement of the cluster structure takes place before the fragments start to separate . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ levels ] we show schematically the total energies of the @xmath4 @xmath24 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 isomers and barriers for the transitions between those states . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen from the figure that transition to the ground ( @xmath24 ) state with subsequent fission into the @xmath29 and @xmath30 fragments , @xmath31 , ( shown by solid lines ) is preferred path for fission of both @xmath5 and @xmath6 isomers of the @xmath4 cluster and requires only about 0.2  ev for @xmath5 isomer and 0.26  ev for @xmath6 isomer . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the direct fission process , @xmath32 , ( shown by dashed lines ) requires about 0.5  ev . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the barrier for the transition between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 isomers .    </S>",
    "<S> another example of cluster structure rearrangement in the fission process is the @xmath1 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the fission barrier for this reaction is shown in figure  [ fission18 ] . </S>",
    "<S> if two fragments of the parent cluster were not allowed to adjust their ionic structure the fission barrier would be about 1  ev . </S>",
    "<S> rearrangement of the cluster structure allows to reduce the fission barrier down to 0.31  ev . during the fission process </S>",
    "<S> the daughter fragments start to drift away from each other and a `` neck '' forms between the fragments . </S>",
    "<S> formation of the `` neck '' results in a metastable transitional state . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of this state , as well as the geometry of the parent cluster are shown in figure  [ rearrangement ] .    in table  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab ] we have summarized our results for the fission barrier heights and compared them with the results of other molecular dynamics simulations and with the predictions of the jellium model .    </S>",

    "<S> we found that for a consistent choice of the atoms removed from the cluster the fission barrier for the reaction @xmath0 has a weak dependence on the initial isomer structure of the parent cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the particular ionic structure of the cluster is largely insignificant for the height of the fission barrier . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important argument for justification of the jellium model approach to the description of the fission process of multiply charged metal clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown importance of rearrangement of the cluster ionic structure during the fission process . </S>",
    "<S> the fission reaction can go through transition to another isomer state of the parent cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this transition can occur before actual separation of the fragments begins and/or `` neck '' between the separating fragments is formed . in any case </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fission barrier can be significantly lower compared to the one for the direct fission path .    </S>",
