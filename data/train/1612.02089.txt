    "the anomalous suppression of @xmath2 production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been considered as a signal of the existence of deconfined matter , i.e. , the  quark - gluon plasma \" ( qgp )  @xcite . in nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the production of charmonia is affected by interactions within the incoming nuclei ( cold nuclear matter , cnm ) and the subsequently formed medium ( hot nuclear matter , hnm ) .",
    "the former include a shadowing of parton distribution functions , cronin effect and nuclear absorption .",
    "they occur prior to the formation of qgp and , at high energies , usually do not involve charmonium eigenstates , but rather pre - resonance states which therefore result in a similar modification of the eventually formed eigenstates .",
    "the hnm effects include inelastic collisions with partons , color screening and the recombination of charm and anti - charm quarks in qgp .",
    "differences between the measured nuclear modification factors ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath2 and @xmath4 should mainly be caused by the hot medium .",
    "the sequential suppression idea , based on the hierarchy of binding energies , suggests that @xmath4 should suffer much stronger suppression than @xmath2 in qgp , due to its smaller binding energy  @xcite , with estimated dissociation temperatures of @xmath5@xmath6  1.5 - 2@xmath7 and @xmath8@xmath6@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this would mean that the @xmath4 can hardly survive in qgp and produce a small @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , applying an instantaneous melting picture with the above quoted temperature , transport model calculations result in a double ratio of @xmath1@xmath60.1 in central pb - pb(@xmath10=2.76tev ) collisions for 6.5gev / c@xmath11@xmath12@xmath1130gev / c  @xcite .",
    "this underestimates the experimental data significantly  @xcite .",
    "one idea to improve on this situation is to include regeneration processes for the @xmath13 , which , because of its smaller dissociation temperature , would likely be operative near the hadronization transition and in the subsequent hadronic phase  @xcite . on the other hand , both qgp and the initially formed @xmath14 pairs in heavy - ion collisions have time evolution scales which can interfere and cause significant deviations from an equilibrium evolution  @xcite",
    "this situation is reinforced if the binding potential is weakened due to color screening , and for high - momentum charmonia due to time dilation effects  @xcite .",
    "instead of being an eigenstate , the @xmath0 dipole evolves as a superposition of eigenstates through the medium .",
    "most currently used quarkonium transport models  @xcite do not account for transitions between ground and excited states . while this is probably a good approximation for the predominantly produced ground states , a ",
    "dynamical feeddown \" may have significant effects on the yields of excited states  @xcite .",
    "the composition will not only change with time but also as a consequence of medium effects on the potential , which specifically may enhance the overlap with the larger - size excited states .",
    "since the internal motion of @xmath15 and @xmath16 inside charmonium bound states is approximately non - relativistic , we employ the time - dependent schrdinger equation to describe its wavefunction evolution .",
    "we explore the in - medium heavy - quark ( hq ) potential , @xmath17 , within two limits , the free ( @xmath18 ) and internal @xmath19 energies , for which we can employ results from lattice qcd  @xcite . after separating off the angular parts , the radial time - dependent schrdinger equation for the quarkonium wavefunction",

    "( [ seq ] ) , we employ the crank - nicholson method  @xcite , which utilizes a discretization of the time evolution as @xmath24 with @xmath25 the non - zero entries are given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    from the @xmath0 dipole wavefunction , @xmath29",

    "after a hard collision in pb - pb collisions , the @xmath0 dipole is produced within @xmath42 fm / c .",
    "the vacuum formation time of charmonium eigenstates , @xmath43 , is usually comparable to the qgp thermalization time @xmath44 , but can become significantly longer at high momenta ( lorentz time dilation ) and/or for color - screened potentials .",

    "this can be achieved by making a gaussian ansatz , @xmath47 and adjust the the width , @xmath48 accordingly .",
    "we find @xmath48=0.23fm and 0.62fm to satisfy the experimental value of @xmath49 in @xmath46 , representing 2 different values of the relative velocity between @xmath15 and @xmath16 inside the dipole .",
    "the coefficient @xmath50 can be fixed to the normalization of the radial wavefunction , @xmath51 .",
    "we neglect medium effects in the hq potential in pre - equilibrium stage prior to qgp formation , which amounts to conserving the initial fraction of eigenstates in the wavepackage .",

    "the pertinent double ratio of direct @xmath2 and @xmath4 nuclear modification factors ( without electromagnetic decay feeddowns from excited states ) , @xmath57 , markedly increases with time , see lower panel of fig .",

    "this effect is significantly less pronounced when using the internal energy as hq potential , since the much stronger attraction tends to keep the @xmath0 wavepackage more compact thus increasing ( reducing ) the overlap with the ground ( excited ) state , see the red line ( with circles ) in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - sigma023 ] .",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    [ fig - sigma023 ]    we repeat the same calculations as described in the previous paragraph for larger width of the initial gaussian wavepackage , @xmath62fm ( which also recovers the empirical @xmath13-over-@xmath2 ratio in @xmath46 collisions ) , cf .",
    "fig.[fig - sigma062 ] .",
    "the enhancement in the @xmath13 @xmath3 is significantly delayed , as is the suppression of the @xmath2 due to a smaller relative velocity of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . these delays also manifest themselves in the slower growth of the @xmath57 double ratio , starting out at values below one for all 3 scenarios considered , while still reaching well above one at later times for @xmath52=1.5@xmath7 and both potential types ( less for stronger attraction ) .",
    "however , for temperatures near @xmath7 , the double ratio drops dramatically within the first 1fm/@xmath15 of the evolution and stays small thereafter .    , but for a larger gaussian width of @xmath48=0.62fm for the initial @xmath0 wavepackage at @xmath44 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    [ fig - sigma062 ]    the inclusion of inelastic charmonium break - up reactions will introduce an imaginary part into our calculation which will lead to a suppression of both @xmath2 and @xmath4 , which is most likely stronger for the excited states .",
    "therefore , we expect the fractions in the lower panels of figs .",
    "[ fig - sigma023 ] and [ fig - sigma062 ] to be generally reduced .",
    "however , the transition mechanisms , @xmath63 , still exist within the @xmath0 dipole and may well play an important role in the finally observed @xmath57 , including a nontrivial momentum dependence .",
    "we have also employed this approach to bottomonia . due to the large binding energy of @xmath64 ,",
    "the screening of the hq potential at the relevant distances , @xmath65 , is less pronounced causing fewer transitions to occur .",
    "however , for the excited @xmath66 and @xmath67 states , we expect transitions to be active , and thus provide an independent handle from the experimental side .",
    "this will be discussed in an upcoming manuscript .",
    "in summary , we have employed the time - dependent schrdinger equation to simulate the internal evolution of hq dipoles in a hot medium .",
    "an in - medium potential causes primordially produced correlated @xmath0 dipoles to undergo transitions between different asymptotic ( vacuum ) eigenstates over timescales which are significantly longer than the vacuum formation times of these states .",
    "in particular , for weak binding the dipole expands rather easily shifting wavefunction overlap from the ground to excited states .",
    "however , we have also found that whether these mechanisms result in an enhancement or suppression of the final double ratio , @xmath57 , of the charmonium nuclear modification factors , rather sensitively depends on the strength of the binding potential . a stronger attraction",
    ", i.e. , less screening , due to either a stronger potential type ( e.g. , @xmath61 rather than @xmath60 ) or due to lower temperatures ( e.g. , near @xmath7 ) , generally leads to smaller double ratios .",
