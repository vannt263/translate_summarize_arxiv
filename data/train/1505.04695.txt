    "et al _ @xcite , the straight - forward way to generate the ms transitions is by applying additional beat frequencies to drive the blue sideband transitions in addition to the red sideband ones , based on ref .",
    "@xcite . yet , in this section , we would like to show another way to realize the ms hamiltonian , based on the bermudez et al .",
    "gate proposal @xcite . here",
    ", we use the carrier transitions that were used to generate @xmath130 in the above derivation , in order to suppress the limiting term , and generate the @xmath172 interaction ( ising hamiltonian ) .",
    "thus , in the rotating frame of the bare state energy levels , the carrier transitions yield @xmath173 where @xmath17 is in the xy plane , and is determined by the relative phase of the two carrier transitions ( fig .",
    "[ f_a1 ] b ) . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that @xmath174 corresponding to a vanishing initial phase between the carrier transitions .",
    "these transitions dress our qutrits , and have significant implications in terms of suppressing the magnetic field noise . moving to the dressed state basis",
    "can be thought of as a @xmath175 rotation about the @xmath63 axis ; thus , @xmath176 in the bare state basis are transformed to @xmath177 in the dressed state basis , respectively . in the rotating frame of the dressed state energy structure ( eq .",
    "[ micro ] ) , the red sideband transition ( eq . [ red ] ) becomes : @xmath178 e^{i\\delta t } -h.c \\right)\\\\   \\left ( b_{n}^\\dagger e^{i\\nu_n t } + h.c \\right ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] if @xmath179 we can neglect the fast rotating terms ; thus we are left with the ms hamiltonian for qutrits : @xmath180 resulting in the ising hamiltonian for spin - one systems , in the second order perturbation theory , if @xmath181 : @xmath182 this looks like we are not proceeding with the derivation of eq .",
    "[ haldanehamiltonian ] , but rather are going backwards .",
    "we have already had the xx hamiltonian ( eq . [ xxhamiltonian ] ) , and with additional effort ( eq . [ micro ] ) , we only obtain the ising hamiltonian .",
    "however , using the trick for generating the @xmath121like term , we also generate the xxz hamiltonian , this time covering the whole positive @xmath39 phase diagram , unlike the previous derivation . in the following ,",
    "we pursue a tunable @xmath38 term , and a tunable @xmath39 term .",
    "_ generation of the control anisotropy @xmath38-term  _ as before , generating the tunable @xmath38-term can be done in two ways : generating an a.c .",
    "stark shift , or imposing detunings . to generate the detuned transitions to implement the first method we can apply an additional @xmath40 detuned microwave driving field , corresponding to the transition between the two zero states of the triplet and the singlet , @xmath41 . in a similar way",
    ", we can obtain the same result by applying co - propagating raman beams corresponding to the same transition ( fig.[d_fig_1 ] a ) .",
    "we then follow the previous steps of derivation : by first transforming to the dressed state basis , where @xmath183 , and then moving to the rotating frame of @xmath184 , we obtain @xmath185 in the second perturbation theory , assuming @xmath186 , and @xmath187 , only the a.c .",
    "stark shifts survive , whereas the other off - diagonal terms coming from the raman transitions between @xmath188 are suppressed in the rwa .",
    "thus , we are left with the desired @xmath189 term , setting @xmath190    generating a tunable @xmath38-term can alternatively be achieved by regarding the @xmath46 bare state energy level as @xmath54-shifted corresponding to its real value in the hyperfine structure ( fig.[d_fig_1 ] b ) .",
    "that is to say , we impose @xmath54-detuning on all the driving fields generating the ising hamiltonian ( eq . [ isinghamiltonian ] ) .",
    "therefore , we are left with the term @xmath191 . transforming to the dressed - state basis and moving to the interaction picture with respect to @xmath184 as was mentioned above",
    ", all the off - diagonal terms are suppressed using the rwa , if we assume that @xmath192 .",
    "once again , we are left with @xmath189 .     for the @xmath39-generating trick .",
    "* there are two ways to realize this term of the @xmath39-generating trick : ( 1 ) ( a. ) to engineer @xmath193 , we apply additional co - propagating laser raman beams , which perform the two raman transitions between @xmath194 with @xmath195 detunings , @xmath196 initial phases and the same effective rabi frequency @xmath197 respectively .",
    "( 2 ) ( b. ) to engineer @xmath198 we apply a z - polarized radio - wave driving field , on resonance with the dressed - state energy structure ( fig.[f_a1 ] b ) , and with a rabi frequency of @xmath199 .",
    "regardless of method , we obtain the desired term by moving to the rotating frame of the dressed energy structure , and using rwa while assuming @xmath200.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    _ generation of the ising - like @xmath39-term  _ to implement the @xmath39-generating trick ; i.e. , adding a spin operator term @xmath49-rotated from the dressed @xmath10 axis , which is @xmath201 , we generate each component separately . the first @xmath202 term is easily produced since it can be set aside from the carrier transition ( eq . [ micro ] ) , such that instead of eq .",
    "[ micro ] , @xmath203 is used as the dressing term . regarding the second term @xmath204",
    "there are two alternatives . choosing @xmath205 , the term @xmath206 is produced by using additional microwave driving fields , corresponding to the two transitions between @xmath194 with @xmath207 detunings , @xmath196 initial phases and the same rabi frequency @xmath197 respectively ( fig.[l ] a ) .",
    "similarly , we can obtain the same result with co - propagating laser raman beams corresponding to these transitions .",
    "choosing @xmath174 , the @xmath208 term , is simply obtained by applying an additional z - polarized radio - frequency ( rf ) driving field , @xmath209 , with @xmath210 ( fig.[l ] b ) .",
    "thus , by moving to the rotating frame of the bare - state energy structure , the rf driving field is not affected .",
    "finally , for both @xmath123 , the desired terms are obtained in the rotating frame corresponding to @xmath211 , using the rwa where we assume that @xmath212 . by applying a @xmath49 rotation around the perpendicular axis , such that @xmath213 is transformed into @xmath214 , the new spin operators and the double dressed state basis are @xmath49 rotated as well .",
    "if we move to the interaction picture with respect to the new term we have built @xmath215 and use the rwa where we require @xmath75 , we end up with the following effective hamiltonian : @xmath216 therefore , we have obtained the required spin - one _ xxz _ afm hamiltonian , while covering the whole positive @xmath4 plane in the phase diagram .",
    "experimentally , the following parameters are realistic : @xmath217mhz , @xmath218mhz , @xmath219mhz , @xmath81khz , @xmath220khz , @xmath80,which gives @xmath221khz , such that @xmath222khz .",
    "in this scheme of generating the _ xxz - d _ hamiltonian , we move to three interaction pictures : the first one is with respect to the bare energy gap of the qutrit , which yields the same first interaction unitary @xmath223 ( eq .",
    "[ u1 ] ) of the first approach .",
    "the second interaction picture is with respect to the microwave dressed state energy gap , giving rise to the following interaction unitary : @xmath224 f^j_x\\tau\\right)\\ ] ] and the last interaction picture is with respect to a superposition of the @xmath225rotated term used for generating the @xmath121 generating trick .",
    "it results in the following interaction unitary : @xmath226 \\tau\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath227 . moving to these interaction pictures results in the effective hamiltonian ( eq . [ heff_final2 ] ) , which yields the simulated evolution @xmath228 .    as was discussed above , in order to move to the interaction frame , we first have to shut down the effective hamiltonian .",
    "this is done by blocking the two non - copropagating raman beams ( setting @xmath125 ) , and eliminating the @xmath47 term for @xmath229 time duration , such that @xmath230 .",
    "the next stage is countering @xmath133 .",
    "for that purpose , we have to shut down the driving fields responsible for @xmath231 .",
    "specifically we have to block the driving fields that generate @xmath130 , and to change the rabi frequency of the carrier transitions to @xmath232 .",
    "this stage should take @xmath112 , such that @xmath233 .",
    "as before , there is no need to counter @xmath127 , and we can measure in any basis we desire .    similarly to the above scheme , during the adiabatic quantum simulation experiment , we counter the main noise sources - the ambient magnetic field fluctuations , and the rabi frequency fluctuations - using a combination of the continuous dynamical decoupling technique with decoherence - free subspace .",
    "we have discussed how to quantum engineer the spin - one xxz - d afm hamiltonian with two schemes .",
    "the first covers @xmath2 , whereas the second covers the whole positive @xmath4 plane in the phase diagram .",
    "it enables us to explore the regime of the heisenberg hamiltonian of integer spin systems where the haldane phase resides .",
    "we have explained how to adiabatically generate this non - trivial topological phase , starting from the large @xmath38 phase with its trivial ground state . during the adiabatic path ,",
    "the ground states are robust to the fluctuations in the magnetic field and rabi frequencies , and belong to a decoherence free subspace .",
    "this permits a longer adiabatic path with higher fidelities .",
    "we have also shown how the haldane phase can be verified with simple experimental measurements .",
    "this proposal may thus constitute an important step towards exploring topological phases with trapped ions .",
