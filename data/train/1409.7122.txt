    "consider a typical wireless sensor network ( wsn ) comprised of a fusion center ( fc ) and numerous sensors that are spatially distributed and wirelessly connected to provide surveillance to the same physical event .",
    "after harvesting information from the environment , these sensors transmit distorted observations to the fusion center ( fc ) to perform data fusion .",
    "a central underlying problem is how to design the sensors and the fusion center to collaboratively accomplish sensing , communication and fusion task in an efficient and trust - worthy manner .",
    "when the sensors and the fusion center are all equipped with multiple antennas and linear filters , this problem may be regarded as one of the cooperative multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) beamforming design problems , which have been tackled from various perspectives @xcite .",
    "for example @xcite target compression ( dimensionality reduction ) beamforming . @xcite and",
    "@xcite consider the scenarios where the orthogonal multiple access channels ( mac ) between the sensors and the fusion center are perfect without fading or noise . for wireless communication ,",
    "the assumption of ideal channel is unrealistic and the imperfect channels are considered in @xcite .",
    "@xcite researches the problem of scalar source transmission with all sensors sharing one total transmission power and using orthogonal mac .",
    "imperfect coherent mac and separate power constraint for each sensor are considered in @xcite , under the assumptions that all channel matrices are square and nonsingular .",
    "the work @xcite and @xcite are particularly relevant to our problem .",
    "@xcite is the first to present a very general system model , which considers noisy and fading channels , separate power constraints and does not impose any constraints on the dimensions of beamformers or channel matrices .",
    "@xcite provides the solutions to several interesting special cases of the general model for coherent mac , such as the noiseless channel case and the no - intersymbol - interference ( no - isi ) channel case . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors develop a useful type of iterative method that is applicable to the general model in @xcite for coherent mac .",
    "all the works mentioned above take the mean square error ( mse ) as performance metric . recently , under the similar system settings of @xcite , joint transceiver design to maximize mutual information(mi ) attract attentions and are studied in @xcite and @xcite , with orthogonal and coherent mac being considered respectively .",
    "the snr maximization problem for wireless sensor network with coherent mac is reported in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the beamforming design problems in mimo multi - sensor decision - fusion system have significant relevance with those in other multi - agent communication networks , e.g. mimo multi - relay and multiuser communication systems .",
    "a large number of exciting papers exist in the literature , see , for example , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this paper considers the very general coherent mac model discussed in @xcite . to solve the original nonconvex joint beamforming problem",
    ", we propose several iterative optimization algorithms using the block coordinate descent ( bcd ) methodology , with their convergence and complexity carefully studied .",
    "specifically our contributions include :    \\1 ) we first propose a 2 block coordinate descent ( 2-bcd ) method that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems one subproblem , with all the beamformers given , is a linear minimum mean square error ( lmmse ) filtering problem and the other one , jointly optimizing the beamformers with the receiver given , is shown to be convex .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xcite considers the special case where the sensor - fc channels are intersymbol - interference ( isi ) free ( i.e. the sensor - fc channel matrix is an identity matrix ) and solves the entire problem by semidefinite programming(sdp ) and relaxation .",
    "here we reformulate the joint optimization of beamformers , even with arbitrary sensor - fc channel matrices , into a second - order cone programming(socp ) problem , which is more efficiently solvable than the general sdp problem .",
    "convergence analysis shows that this 2-bcd algorithm guarantees its limit points to be stationary points of the original problem .",
    "interestingly enough , although not presented in this article , the proposed 2-bcd algorithm has one more fold of importance ",
    "the convexity of its subproblem jointly optimizing beamformers can be taken advantage of by the multiplier method @xcite , which requires the original problem to be convex , and therefore gives birth to decentralized solutions to the problem under the 2-bcd framework .",
    "\\2 ) we have also attacked the mse minimization with respect to one single beamformer and developed fully analytical solutions ( possibly up to a simple one - dimension bisection search ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that , although the same problem has been studied in several previous papers ( e.g. @xcite ) , we are able to carry out the analysis to the very end and thoroughly solved the problem by clearly describing the solution structure and deriving the solutions for all possible cases .",
    "specifically , we explicitly obtain the conditions for judging the positiveness of the lagrange multiplier .",
    "moreover , in the zero - lagrange - multiplier case with singular quadratic matrix , we give out the energy - preserving solution via pseudoinverse among all possible optimal solutions . to the best of our knowledge , these exact results have never been discussed in existing literature .",
    "\\3 ) our closed form solution for one single beamformer s update paves the way to multiple block coordinate descent algorithms .",
    "a layered - bcd algorithm is proposed , where an inner - loop cyclically optimizing each separate beamformer is embedded in the 2-bcd framework .",
    "this layered - bcd algorithm is shown to guarantee the limit points of its solution sequence to be stationary . besides we also consider a wide class of multiple block coordinate descent algorithms with the very general essentially cyclic updating rule .",
    "it is interesting to note that this class of algorithms subsumes the one proposed in @xcite as a specialized realization .",
    "furthermore , as will be shown , by appropriately adjusting the update of each single beamformer to a proximal version and introducing approximation , the essentially cyclic multiple block coordinate descent algorithm exhibits fast converging rate , guarantees convergence to stationary points and achieves high computation efficiency .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : system model ] introduces the system model of the joint beamforming problem in the mimo wireless sensor network .",
