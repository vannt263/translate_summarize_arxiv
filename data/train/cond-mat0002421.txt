    "it is widely believed that the 2d @xmath6 model is relevant to the low energy physics of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "this is why investigation of this model is of great interest both for theory and experiment . in spite of great efforts during more than a decade",
    "there is no full understanding of the phase diagram of the @xmath6 model , however some facts are well established . at zero doping",
    "the model is equivalent to the heisenberg model on a square lattice which has long range neel order @xcite .",
    "doping by holes destroys the order .",
    "a simplified picture of noninteracting holes leads to the neel state instability with respect to spirals at arbitrary small but finite doping @xcite .",
    "however more sophisticated numerical calculations which take into account renormalization of the hole green s function under the doping indicate that the neel order is stable below some critical hole concentration @xmath7 @xcite . in the neel phase ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "in all waves except s - wave , there is magnon mediated superconducting pairing between holes .",
    "it is also clear that at very small hopping there is phase separation in the model because separation leads to reduction of the number of destroyed antiferromagnetic links @xcite    the purpose of the present work is to elucidate spin structure of the ground state at @xmath8 .",
    "the most important hint comes from experiment : indications of stripes in the high-@xmath9 materials @xcite .",
    "another important hint is a remarkable stability of the spin dimerized phase in the frustrated @xmath10 model .",
    "the idea of such state for this model was first formulated by read and sachdev @xcite , and was then confirmed by further work @xcite .",
    "the stability of such a configuration implies that the lattice symmetry is spontaneously broken and the ground state is four - fold degenerate .",
    "such a route towards quantum disorder is known rigorously to take place in one dimension , where the lieb - schultz - mattis ( lsm ) theorem guarantees that a gapped phase always breaks the translational symmetry @xcite .",
    "some time ago affleck suggested that the lsm theorem can be extended to higher dimensions , and the gapped states of quantum systems necessarily break the discrete symmetries of the lattice @xcite .",
    "the example of the @xmath10 model provides further support for this idea .",
    "there have been several attempts to consider the spin - dimerized phase in a doped heisenberg antiferromagnet . for this purpose affleck and",
    "marston @xcite analyzed hubbard - heisenberg model in the weak - coupling regime , grilli , castellani and g. kotliar @xcite considered @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath6 model , and very recently vojta and sachdev @xcite considered @xmath13 , @xmath12 , @xmath6 model .",
    "these works indicated a stability of the spin - dimerized phase in some region of parameters , providing a very important guiding line .",
    "however relevance of these results to `` physical regime '' of the @xmath6 model remained unclear .",
    "stability of the spin - dimer order for the @xmath6 model has been demonstrated in the paper @xcite .",
    "the only small parameter used in the analysis was hole concentration with respect to the half filling . in the present work we continue studies in the same direction applying various techniques . to be confident in the results we prove stability of the dimer phase by two independent methods : 1 ) calculation of the magnon green s function in the dimerized phase ( green function method ) , 2 ) comparison of the ground state energies of the doped neel state and the dimerized state ( direct energy method ) .",
    "the second approach is very simple physically and technically .",
    "the first approach is more technically involved , but it allows us to calculate the critical concentration more precisely .    to incorporate some experimental data we consider @xmath14 model defined by the following hamiltonian @xmath15 @xmath16 is the creation operator of an electron with spin @xmath17 @xmath18 at site @xmath19 of the two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "the @xmath20 represents nearest neighbor sites , @xmath21 - next nearest neighbor ( diagonal ) , and @xmath22 represents next next nearest sites .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath23 and the number density operator is @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 operators act in the hilbert space with no double electron occupancy .",
    "antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath26 are arranged in a stripe pattern shown in fig . 1 : solid links correspond to @xmath27 , and dashed links correspond to @xmath28 .    for real cuprates the antiferromagnetic interaction is isotropic , @xmath29 .",
    "however for theoretical analysis of the magnon green s function it is convenient to consider nonzero @xmath30 and later set @xmath31 . the antiferromagnetic exchange measured in two",
    "magnon raman scattering @xcite is @xmath32 .",
    "calculation of the hopping matrix elements has been done by andersen _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "they consider a two - plane situation , and the effective matrix elements are slightly different for symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of orbitals between planes . after averaging over these combinations",
    "we get : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "below we set @xmath36 , in these units @xmath37 these values are confirmed by the analysis @xcite of photoemission ( pes ) data for charge transfer insulator sr@xmath38cuo@xmath38cl@xmath38 . in further numerical estimates",
    "we will use the values ( [ ts ] ) , but we will also consider `` pure '' @xmath6 model which corresponds to @xmath39 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe magnon green s function at zero doping , and remind ideas of the brueckner technique used in the work . in sec",
    "iii the single - hole dispersion and wave function are considered .",
    "this section is important for both green s function method and for direct energy method .",
    "sections iv and v contain the main results of the paper : in sec .",
    "iv we demonstrate stabilization of the dimerization by doping using green s function method , and in sec .",
    "v we come to the same conclusion using direct energy method . sec .",
    "vi addresses the quantum phase transition from the dimerized liquid to the normal fermi liquid at high doping . in sec vii",
    "we discuss shape of the fermi surface and distribution of the photoemission intensity .",
    "viii summarizes the work .",
    "some technical details concerning so called `` triple '' diagrams are discussed in appendix .",
    "at half filling ( @xmath40 ) the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is equivalent to a heisenberg model which has already been studied@xcite : for @xmath41 the ground state is a quantum state with gapped spectrum , and for @xmath42 there is spontaneous neel ordering with gapless spin waves .    in order to study the stability of the dimer phase we first derive an effective hamiltonian in terms of bosonic operators creating spin - wave triplets ( magnons ) @xmath43 , @xmath44 and fermionic operators creating holes @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 from the spin singlets shown in fig .",
    "this hamiltonian consists of four parts : the spin - wave part @xmath48 , the hole part @xmath49 , the spin - wave - hole interaction @xmath50 , and the hole - hole interaction @xmath51 .",
    "let us start from @xmath48 .",
    "similar effective theories have been derived in refs.@xcite and we only present the result : @xmath52 we also introduce an infinite repulsion on each site , in order to enforce the kinematic constraint @xmath53 . @xmath54",
    "the following definitions are used in ( [ ht ] ) : @xmath55 throughout the paper we work in the brillouin zone of the dimerized lattice .    at zero doping",
    "( @xmath40 ) @xmath48 is an exact mapping of the original hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) . to analyze this case",
    "it is enough to apply the brueckner technique @xcite .",
    "the result for the normal spin - wave green s function reads : @xmath56 where @xmath57 normal @xmath58 and anomalous @xmath59 self - energies are caused by the quartic interaction @xmath60 and the most important contribution @xmath61 comes from the brueckner diagrams as described in @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking there is also some contribution to the self - energy caused by the `` triple '' interaction @xmath62 .",
    "however this contribution is very small ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) and therefore we neglect it .",
    "expansion of the self - energy in powers of @xmath63 near @xmath64 gives quasiparticle residue and spin - wave spectrum @xmath65^{2 } - \\tilde{b_{\\bf{k}}}^{2}}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expressions for effective bogoliubov parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given in @xcite .",
    "the spin - wave gap @xmath68 , @xmath69 , obtained as a result of a selfconsistent solution of dyson s equations is plotted in fig.2 ( line at @xmath70 ) .",
    "the critical value of the explicit dimerization ( point where the gap vanishes ) @xmath71 is in agreement with results of series expansions @xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the validity of the brueckner approximation is justified by the smallness of the gas parameter @xmath72 . at the critical point @xmath73 .",
    "consider now doping by holes . on the single dimer @xmath74 the hole can exist in symmetric ( bonding ) and antisymmetric ( antibonding ) states . corresponding fermionic operators @xmath75 , and @xmath76 @xmath47 creating hole from the singlet @xmath77 are defined as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 numerate the dimer sites .",
    "we will see later that doping suppresses spin quantum fluctuations of the dimerized state so that @xmath72 at @xmath81 does not exceed 0.07 .",
    "this is why we can neglect these fluctuations and consider pure dimerized spin liquid . for comparison we can say that even for spin ladder influence of the quantum fluctuations on the hole dispersion is not strong @xcite in spite of the fact that in this case @xmath82 .    in leading approximation the wave function of a hole with given quasimomentum",
    "is of the form @xmath83 numerates the dimers and @xmath84 is number of sites in the dimerized lattice .",
    "we remind that throughout the paper we work in the brillouin zone of the dimerized lattice .",
    "sometimes the results are transfered to the usual lattice , but then it is specially pointed .",
    "the dispersion corresponding to the state ( [ 1 ] ) can be easily calculated considering all possible hoppings between the dimers .",
    "the result is @xmath85 there is also an additional t - independent constant in the dispersion @xmath86 the constant arises because a hole destroys one spin dimer ( this gives @xmath87 ) and four links @xmath88 ( see hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) ) . in the present section",
    "we ignore @xmath89 because it gives just a shift of the entire dispersion .",
    "however in section v , calculating total energy of the system we will restore @xmath89 .    the wave function ( [ 1 ] ) as well as the dispersion ( [ e1 ] ) are renormalized due to virtual admixture of antibonding states and magnon excitations .",
    "now we calculate this admixture to show that it is small . in this calculation",
    "we follow the approach developed earlier for the doped spin ladder @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) admixes following states to the wave function ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath90 the state @xmath91 is similar to @xmath92 with replacement of bonding orbital to the antibonding one .",
    "the states @xmath93 describe excited triplet ( magnon ) on the dimer @xmath94 and a hole on the one of the closest dimers , for example @xmath95 denotes the dimer on the right , @xmath96 denotes the up - right dimer , etc .",
    "the brackets @xmath97 denote that spins of the magnon and the hole are combined to the total spin @xmath98 and z - projection @xmath98 : @xmath99 .",
    "calculation of matrix elements of the hamiltonian is straightforward .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements are @xmath100 the nonzero nondiagonal matrix elements are @xmath101 diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix can be performed numerically .",
    "this gives the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath102 and the quasiparticle residue @xmath103 which by definition is equal to the weight of the state @xmath92 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) in the exact wave function @xcite .",
    "the minimum energy for different sets of parameters is shown in the fifth column of the table i. we remind that we use units @xmath36 . in the last column",
    "we show position of the minimum . for comparison",
    "we also display the minimum value of @xmath104 ( see eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) ) , which always is at @xmath105 .",
    "table i.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     altogether results for @xmath7 presented in tables ii , and iii , iv and derived by absolutely different methods are in remarkable agreement .",
    "this gives a very strong confirmation of the phase transition to the columnar spin dimerized state .",
    "physical reason for stability of the spin dimerized state is especially evident after the energy considerations : this is the gain in the hole kinetic energy , it is `` easier '' to propagate in the dimerized background .",
    "we have discussed the transition to the neel state at hole concentration @xmath106 .",
    "it is clear that at large @xmath107 ( @xmath2 ) there is a 2nd order phase transition to the normal fermi liquid .",
    "let us define the spin - dimer order parameter as @xmath108 where sites 1 , 2 , and 3 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . for perfect dimerized state @xmath109 . there are two mechanisms for reduction of the order parameter .",
    "the first one is due to spin quantum fluctuations which approximately give @xmath110 .",
    "the second mechanism is direct effect of doping .",
    "naive estimate is @xmath111 , however the hole wave function ( [ crude ] ) is slightly different from the bare one and because of this the coefficient in the naive formula is slightly renormalized .",
    "all together this gives @xmath112-n_t,\\ ] ] where @xmath113 is the admixture coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ crude ] ) . this formula is derived in dilute gas approximation , i.e at @xmath114 , however for an estimate we can extend it to large @xmath107 . setting @xmath115 we find from ( [ ord1 ] ) that @xmath116 vanishes at @xmath117 .",
    "we repeat that this is only an estimate because the approach assumes that @xmath118 .",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath119 model at zero temperature is presented in fig . 7    because of the mobile holes the dimerized spin liquid at @xmath120 is a conducting state",
    ". stability of this state is a very robust effect because it is due to the high energy correlations ( typical energy scale @xmath121 ) .",
    "there are also low energy effects with typical energy scale @xmath122 which can lead to hole - hole pairing , charge stripes , etc .",
    "we do not consider these effects in the present work because they are secondary with respect to the main one : spin dimerization .",
    "however we would like to note that there is a simple mechanism for charge stripes induced by the spin dimers : because of the anisotropic dispersion , see fig .",
    "3 , the charge response is enhanced at some momentum @xmath123 .",
    "the effect is very sensitive to additional hopping parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 , they can further enhance or suppress the response .",
    "shape of the fermi surface for the dimerized state at the doping @xmath126 and hopping matrix elements from ( [ ts ] ) is shown in fig.3 by the solid line . in this figure",
    "we put @xmath127 along the horizontal axis and @xmath128 along the vertical axis , where @xmath129 is defined on the dimerized lattice . in terms of the brillouin zone of the original lattice",
    "this is usual quadrant : @xmath130 , @xmath131 . to distinguish between the dimerized lattice and the original one we denote by capital letters momenta corresponding to the original lattice : @xmath132 , @xmath133 .    in a real sample",
    "there are domains with one stripe dimerization and there are domains with stripes rotated by @xmath134 . therefore in an experiment",
    "one should see two superimposed fermi surfaces .",
    "corresponding picture for @xmath135 is shown in fig .",
    "the first impression is that it is very much different from what is usually observed in angular resolved photoemission ( pes ) experiments , see e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite however let us calculate intensity of the photoemission .",
    "the photoeffect operator is of the form @xmath136 where summation is performed over sites of the square lattice .",
    "amplitude of the hole creation from the dimerized background ( oriented as it is shown in fig .",
    "1 ) is equal to @xmath137 here we have taken into account that according to considerations in section iii wave function of the hole in bonding state is practically unrenormalized .",
    "we stress once more that * p * is a quasimomentum corresponding to the original lattice . according to ( [ am ] ) intensity of pes spectra ( @xmath138 )",
    "is dropping quickly as @xmath139 is increasing . if one assumes that the @xmath6 model originates from the single band hubbard model , then the corrections of the order of @xmath140 to the pes intensity can be calculated in a way suggested in ref .",
    "this gives @xmath141 the hubbard repulsion @xmath142 is excluded from this formula using relation @xmath143 .",
    "according to ( [ int ] ) the pes intensity is strongly asymmetric at the fermi surface .",
    "for example at @xmath135 the intensity at the right top corner of the fermi surface , @xmath144 , @xmath145 ( see fig .",
    "8) is 3.5 times smaller than that at the left top corner of the fermi surface , @xmath146 , @xmath145 . in real cuprate",
    "the asymmetry must be even stronger .",
    "the reason for further enhancement of the asymmetry is structure factor of the zhang - rice singlet .",
    "this is quite similar to the well understood situation in the charge transfer insulator sr@xmath38cuo@xmath38cl@xmath38 , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus the angle resolved photoemission measurements are sensitive only to the `` inner '' parts ( the parts closest to the @xmath147 point : @xmath148 ) of the fermi surfaces shown in fig .",
    "shape of this effective `` fermi surface '' is very close to what is observed in numerous pes experiments .",
    "another feature which agrees with experiment is width of the `` quasiparticle '' peak along ( 1,1 ) direction : it is always rather big because the peak arises as a superposition of two different peaks corresponding to two different fermi surfaces .",
    "in conclusion , using the dilute gas approximation we have analyzed the phase diagram of the @xmath6 model and the stability of spin - dimerized phase .",
    "the main result of the work is phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "7 . without any explicit dimerization ( @xmath29 )",
    "the spin dimerized phase is stable at hole concentration @xmath149 . at @xmath3",
    "the critical concentrations are @xmath4 , @xmath5 . at @xmath150",
    "the system undergoes transition to the neel state , and at @xmath151 to the normal fermi liquid .    to prove stability of the spin dimerized phase and to calculate critical concentrations",
    "we have used two independent approaches . the first one is based on the calculation of the magnon green s function .",
    "the second approach consists in direct comparison of ground state energies of the neel state and the dimerized state .",
    "both approaches demonstrate stability of the spin dimerized phase and give very close values of the critical concentrations .",

    "however numerical calculation shows that at @xmath164 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 from ( [ ts ] ) the `` triple '' self - energy is by a factor 1.5 smaller than one given by ( [ 3n ] ) . comparing the `` triple '' self - energy with the brueckner one ( [ sh ] )",
    "we find that the `` triple '' self - energy is by a factor 7 smaller .",
