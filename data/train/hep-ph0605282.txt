    "qcd evolution equations have been recently established which include pomeron loops ( or fluctuations )  @xcite .",
    "the main feature of these equations , as compared to the balitsky - jimwlk  balitsky:1995ub+x , jalilian - marian:1997jx+x or kovchegov equations  kovchegov:1999yj+x , are the violation of the geometrical scaling of the @xmath1-matrix and a modified energy dependence for the saturation momentum  mueller:2004se+x .",
    "recently the effect of fluctuations also on single diffractive dissociation  @xcite has been studied and compared with previously obtained mean - field - like results  @xcite at high energies .    in a recent paper  @xcite we have studied the qcd pomeron loop equations in zero transverse dimensions in which case",
    "one can do the calculation of any pomeron loop graph analytically ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the pomeron loop equations are a hierarchy of equations which in zero transverse dimensions take the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a normal ordered number operator defined as @xmath4 which represents the expectation value of @xmath5-pomerons during the evolution .",
    "the single terms in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) have the following physical meaning : @xmath6 is the bfkl growth term ( @xmath7 here corresponds to @xmath8 in the real bfkl equation ) , @xmath9 describes fluctuations ( pomeron splittings ) and @xmath10 recombinations ( pomeron mergings ) .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) is the zero - transverse - dimensional analog of the real qcd equations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "one can easely show that ( [ h1 ] ) leads to frame - independent scattering amplitudes when @xmath11 .",
    "the scattering amplitudes have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite by treating the recombination terms as small perturbations . in a recent paper",
    "together with our collaborators  @xcite we have shown that at rapidity @xmath12 , the perturbative treatment of the recombination terms becomes inaccurate and needs to be replaced by more complete calculations ( this limit is also indicated in our corrections to the lo result given in eq .",
    "( 15 ) in ref .",
    "thus , the results for diffractive cross sections shown in this paper are only reliable up to @xmath13 .",
    "in this paper we use the techniques which we have developed in  shoshi:2005pf together with the agk cutting rules  @xcite to calculate single , double and central diffractive cross sections in zero transverse dimensions ( see fig .  [ d3 ] ) .",
    "we do consider only the case where the diffractive masses , rapidity gaps and the total rapidity are large .",
    "all the relevant pomeron graphs are included in the calculations . in four dimensional qcd ,",
    "the analogous calculations are not yet available .",
    "so far only the single diffractive scattering in real qcd including pomeron loops has been calculated , however , only in the kinematical region where the diffractive mass is not too large  @xcite .",
    "thus , our calculation in zero transverse dimensions may give indications about the diffractive mass dependence of the diffractive cross section in four dimensional qcd at very large diffractive masses .",
    "we expect the energy dependence of the qcd high energy diffractive scattering would bear some resemblances of our result .",
    "a longstanding problem has been accompanying diffractive dissociation : the lowest order pomeron contribution to diffractive dissociation disagrees with the fermilab data ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) and it violates unitarity at very high energies .",
    "there have been several attempts to solve this problem by considering the renormalization of the pomeron flux  goulianos:1995wy , a larger impact parameter  @xcite or a smaller survival probability  @xcite at high energies . in this work",
    "we show that single , double and central diffractive cross sections would naturally fulfill unitarity limits when multiple pomeron exchanges are taken into account in addition to the lowest order pomeron exchange .",
    "furthermore we do find that the differential diffractive cross sections ( differential with respect to the masses ) are suppressed by powers of @xmath14 .",
    "we will show that this suppression is characteristic for differential diffractive cross sections and emerges from pomeron splittings / mergings in the @xmath15-channel which are needed in order to calculate the differential diffractive cross sections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we do start with an illustration of the agk cutting rules , then go over to the single diffractive cross section , which is then followed by double diffractive and central diffractive cross sections .",
    "the agk cutting rules  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) represent the generalization of the optical theorem for the case of multiple pomeron exchange .",
    "although agk cutting rules have not been proven for qcd , they have been discussed and used in several publications ( see refs .",
    "we will show below how the agk cutting rules lead to expectable results for particle - particle and particle - nucleus results also within this qcd model , and then use them to also calculate diffractive scattering processes .    to illustrate the agk cutting rules ,",
    "let us consider for instance the total cross section for particle - particle scattering , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the amplitude for the exchange of @xmath18 pomerons .",
    "according to the agk cutting rules , @xmath19 is related to the elastic cross section @xmath20 and inelastic cross section @xmath21 , @xmath22 which are given by @xmath23 and ) @xmath18 starts from @xmath24 because there have to be at least two pomerons , one pomeron on either side of the elastic cut .",
    "one side of the cut can be viewed as initial state of the scattering while the other side can be understood as the final state . ]",
    "@xmath25 in the above equations @xmath26 represents the @xmath18-pomeron exchange graph where no pomeron is cut ( elastic cut ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ elastic]b and @xmath27 is the @xmath18-pomeron exchange graph with @xmath5 pomerons being simultaneously cut ( inelastic cut ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ elastic]a ( cut pomerons are marked by crosses ) . in the next sections we will introduce also the diffractive cut as shown for example in fig .  [ sd]a where only a part of a pomeron is cut .",
    "the diffractive cut generates diffractive ( dissociation ) cross sections while the inelastic cut ( cut of an entire pomeron ) leads to a uniform production of final state particles in rapidity .",
    "-pomeron exchange graphs : in graph a @xmath5 of the @xmath18-pomerons are cut ( inelastic cut ) and in graph b none of the pomerons is cut ( elastic cut ) . ,",
    "width=491 ]    for convenience , let us summarize the agk cutting rules , which allow us to calculate @xmath26 and @xmath28 and the diffractive cross sections in the next sections :    * no matter how many pomerons are cut , there is always one and only one cut which indicates the separation between the initial and final states of the scattering ; * each cut - pomeron gives an extra factor of @xmath29 , which can be understood as a result of the discontinuity of the pomeron amplitude ; * each un - cut pomeron obtains an extra factor of @xmath24 since it can be placed on either side of the cut .",
    "thus , applying the above agk cutting rules on fig .",
    "[ elastic ] , we obtain @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 $ ] is the number of selections of @xmath5 pomerons out of @xmath18 pomerons .",

    "( [ sig_inel ] ) , respectively .    to gain confidence in the agk cutting rules ,",
    "let us show that the cross sections obtained using the agk cutting rules and the pomeron calculus do agree with known unitarity limits at high energies . for particle - particle scattering the amplitude for @xmath18-pomeron exchanges at leading order",
    "@xcite is @xmath33 ( the factor @xmath34 has already been taken into account in eqs.([sig_tot],[sig_diff],[sig_inel ] ) ) . inserting this amplitude in eqs.([sig_tot],[sig_diff],[sig_inel ] ) , one finds @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 in large @xmath38 limit , which is in agreement with the black disk limit . for particle - nucleus scattering , now with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of hadrons in the nucleus and @xmath41 , it is straightforward to obtain the following results for the total , elastic ( diffractive ) and inelastic cross sections , @xmath42 which do as well respect unitarity limits at very high rapidity .",
    "the single diffractive process , @xmath43 , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ d3 ] , is a process where one of the @xmath44-particles breaks up into a `` diffractive state '' @xmath45 which is separated by a rapidity gap from the @xmath44-particle in the final state which remains intact . in the language of pomerons ,",

    "this factor appears through the pomeron splitting at @xmath88 .",
    "a suppression by powers of @xmath7 is characteristic for differential diffractive cross sections because pomeron splittings in the @xmath15-channel ( see figs .
