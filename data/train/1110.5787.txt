    "the study of vortex and vortex lines in superfluids and superconductors is an evergreen field of research @xcite . in type - i superconductors ,",
    "the rigidity of the wavefunction of superconducting electrons determines the expulsion of the magnetic field ( meissner effect ) : the superconductivity is destroyed at a critical magnetic field .",
    "however , when the value of the ginzburg - landau parameter exceeds a critical value , then the magnetic field can enter the superconductor : the flux penetrates in a regular array of flux tubes , each carrying a flux quantum @xcite .",
    "the corresponding properties of vortices in type - ii superconductors have been then intensively studied in bcs and high - temperature superconductors @xcite    vortices have been extensively studied also in neutral superfluids : as it is well known , the effect of a rotation on neutral particles is equivalent to that of a magnetic field on a system of charged particles @xcite . as a consequence , one has in neutral superfluids the counterpart of the effects regarding the penetration of a magnetic field in a superconductor : the expulsion of the magnetic field has its equivalent in that a neutral superfluid , up to a certain value of the rotation , does not rotate together with a rotating trap or vessel . thus the use of ginzburg - landau theory to describe vortex states is not restricted to superconductivity and it can be applied , with certain adjustments , to neutral superfluids .    the study of vortex states in neutral superfluids witnessed in the last two decades a substantial additional interest due to progress in the realization , control and manipulation of ultracold bosonic and fermionic gases @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the study of properties of vortices in ultracold gases subjected to rotating external potentials attracted a significant attention @xcite . for",
    "trapped bose - einstein condensates , when the condensate rotates with angular velocity @xmath0 higher than a critical value , one or several vortices nucleate : for more rapid rotations , the vortices form a dense triangular array @xcite . at",
    "even higher rotating frequencies the superfluid properties are lost and when @xmath0 is close to the radial trap frequency the lowest - landau - level approximation becomes applicable @xcite : the rotating dilute gas is expected to exhibit a transition from a superfluid to various strongly correlated , non - superfluid states analogous to those typical in the fractional quantum hall effect for electrons in a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the recent experimental realization of synthetic magnetic and electric fields acting on neutral atoms using a suitable spatial variation and time dependence of the effective vector potential @xcite opens the way to simulate many - body systems in controllable ( static ) electro - magnetic fields @xcite : such a possibility , eventually together with the use of rotating traps @xcite , opens the way to the study of bosonic and/or fermionic systems in a vast class of simulated magnetic fields @xcite , including spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the study of vortices has been carried out both in two- and in three- dimensional systems . in two dimensions , the thermally generated vortices form , at low temperature , pairs of opposite vorticity , giving rise to power - law correlation functions . at the critical point of the corresponding berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt )",
    "transition the vortices start to unbind and high - temperature exponential decaying correlations arise @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic model in which the bkt transition has been deeply investigated is the @xmath1 model on a lattice , which is also commonly used to describe defect - mediated phase transitions and superfluidity in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the unbinding of the vortices around the @xmath1 transition point was studied and visualized using monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 model description has the advantage that it is possible to extract the topological degrees of freedom ( i.e. , the vortices ) by constructing the dual theory @xcite , showing that the vortices interact via a logarithmic potential . a physical realization of the lattice @xmath1 model is provided by josephson junction arrays , i.e. superconducting grains located at the vertices of a network @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for large number of particles per site and negligible fluctuations of the number , the effective hamiltonian of ultracold bosons in optical lattices can be mapped to that of an ( eventually quantum ) @xmath1 model @xcite : the vortex number and the bkt transition were experimentally detected in a two - dimensional bose gas in an optical lattice at finite temperature @xcite .    passing from two to three dimensions , e.g. by coupling two - dimensional systems ,",
    "then vortex lines connect the core of the two - dimensional vortices : the vortex lines must either close on themselves ( vortex rings ) or terminate on boundaries @xcite .",
    "following the original ideas put forward by onsager @xcite and feynman @xcite that vortex excitations are responsible for the superfluid transition in @xmath2 , the properties of vortices in three - dimensional superfluid systems were subsequently investigated : a real - space renormalization technique was used in @xcite to generate screened vortex energies and core sizes .",
    "the @xmath1 model is useful also to study vortex excitations in three dimensions : using the dual description , it is possible to write the hamiltonian in terms of vortex loop degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "monte carlo results highlighted the role of vortex loops , showing indeed that they are responsible for the phase transition in the three - dimensional @xmath1 model @xcite . using a three - dimensional generalization of the two - dimensional kosterlitz real - space scaling procedure , shenoy wrote down scaling equations for the vortex - loop fugacity and the loop coupling @xcite .",
    "this computation was then generalized to the anisotropic three - dimensional @xmath1 model @xcite in order to study the @xmath3@xmath4 crossover .",
    "important contributions to theory of vortices and vortex lines were made by luciano reatto and his collaborators @xcite : in @xcite the energy of a @xmath2 vortex line and the density distribution in the core region were computed using model many - body wavefunctions .",
    "the velocity of translation of the vortex ring was also computed and shown to be in agreement with experimental results .",
    "the variational energy was calculated using the percus - yevick and the convoluted - hypernetted - chain integral equations : the structure factor entering these equations was taken by measured values and assumed linear , with slope @xmath5 , at small wavevectors @xcite  as it is well known , a model wavefunction leading to this result was constructed in the seminal paper @xcite .",
    "the properties of vortex lines in @xmath2 were reconsidered in @xcite where a shadow wavefunction was used ( optimized shadow wavefunctions for the ground state of liquid and solid @xmath2 and at the liquid - solid @xmath2 interface were studied in @xcite ) . in @xcite the excitation energy of the vortex was then computed showing a very weak dependence on the density when the latter is increased from equilibrium to near freezing , giving insights on the properties of the classical core parameter @xcite .",
    "the problem we address in the present paper is the study of the effects of inhomogeneities on the vortex lines distribution in three - dimensional lattices .",
    "as motivation of our work , we have in mind mostly two systems : trapped ultracold atoms in optical lattices and neutron stars . regarding the former ,",
    "the low - energy properties of ultracold atoms in deep optical lattices are in general described by hubbard - like models both for bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite . when the system is superfluid ,",
    "in each well @xmath6 of the periodic potential one can define a phase @xmath7 : either due to temperature and/or to the effect of a rotation , vortex lines will develop in the system . since an external potential is usually present in such trapped systems @xcite ,",
    "then an arising issue is the determination of how the trapping potential affects the distribution vortex lines .",
    "the study of the effect of inhomogeneities on the vortex lines in superfluids in a lattice is also relevant in the context of neutron stars ( ns ) .",
    "ns are compact objects , with typical masses of order @xmath8 solar masses and typical radii of order @xmath9 , formed from the collapsed core of fairly high mass stars when they explode as supernovae .",
    "apart from their extreme compactness , observed ns are usually characterized by very high rotation frequencies  up to a @xmath10  and very high magnetic fields  up to @xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "a ns can be roughly subdivided into three zones having different composition and properties : the first is a shell called the outer crust composed of a lattice of atomic nuclei permeated by an electron gas .",
    "the outer crust ends at about @xmath13 from the surface , where the density reaches @xmath14 .",
    "the next layer in is called the inner crust and consists of a lattice of very neutron rich nuclei permeated by free neutrons and electrons .",
    "theoretical calculations @xcite and indirect observational evidence @xcite support the idea that crustal free neutrons form a superfluid .",
    "the space dependence of the superfluid gap has been also studied @xcite .",
    "the crust ends at about @xmath15 from the surface where the density reaches @xmath16 .",
    "the inner region , called the core , is formed by free neutrons , protons and leptons ( neglecting any more exotic composition ) .",
    "again observations seem to suggest that neutrons are superfluid while protons are superconducting @xcite .",
    "vortices are expected to appear in both the inner crust and the core of a ns .",
    "moreover , they are expected to interact in the crust with normal phase lattice nuclei @xcite .",
    "this microscopical interaction is widely believed @xcite to be the mechanism that gives rise to glitches . a glitch is a sudden increase of the otherwise slowly and steady declining neutron star spin period ( for a recent statistical study of glitches",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "the inhomogeneous neutron superfluid fills a layer spanning three order of magnitude in density and it feels an effective periodic potential created by the crustal lattice : free neutrons interact with the lattice nuclei feeling a one - body potential that can be thought as having a thomas - fermi like shape @xcite . at different densities both the lattice nuclei and the lattice length are different @xcite : in any case the potential becomes negligible ( because of the fine range of the nuclear force ) without superimposing with those of the first neighbours , creating in this way a ( deep ) lattice potential for the superfluid neutrons .",
    "an interesting issue is then the study of the effect of the inhomogeneity on the vortex lines in the inner crust of a rotating ns and possibly the individuation of a simplified model capturing the main properties of vortex lines in ns . as a first step towards the individuation of such a simplified model ( having parameters derived from the microscopic hamiltonian ) , we study in the following the distribution of thermally excited vortex lines for a superfluid in a lattice with inhomogeneous couplings proportional to the superfluid gap in the ns inner crust : for this purpose we use the data for the gap presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to explore the main properties of vortex lines in inhomogeneous lattices and have results independent of the microscopic details",
    ", we decided to investigate the inhomogeneous version of the @xmath1 model described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 in eq.([inh_ham ] ) , the sum is on the nearest - neighbours pairs of sites @xmath6 , @xmath18 of a three - dimensional lattice ( supposed cubic for simplicity ) and @xmath19 is a phase variables , having values between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath22 is the coupling between the sites @xmath6 and @xmath18 , that we will assume to be inhomogeneous in the space ( typically gaussian in one or all directions ) .",
    "we will mostly consider in the following open boundary conditions .",
    "several reasons lead us to consider hamiltonian ( [ inh_ham ] ) to model the effect of inhomogeneities on vortex lines : first , in the homogeneous limit ( @xmath23 across the lattice ) , the @xmath1 model can be expressed in terms of the topological degrees of freedom in two and three dimensions , giving important insight on vortex - vortex interactions and on the behaviour of correlation functions . moreover",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ inh_ham ] ) could be realized on its own by using josephson junction arrays with josephson energies @xmath22 varying across the lattice or by considering ultracold atoms in an optical lattice , whose hamiltonian can be mapped in a suitable range of parameters to ( [ inh_ham ] ) . as a last reason , more important for our purposes",
    ", we observe that in the presence of a superfluid in a lattice , the macroscopic wavefunction @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 : then the hamiltonian will have a term @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the hopping parameter .",
    "this means that we can proceed with the identification @xmath28 then , if we have a superfluid in which the number @xmath29 is fixed , e.g. by an external potential , and we want to focus on the equilibrium and dynamical properties due to the behaviour the phases , we can stick to the hamiltonian ( [ inh_ham ] ) with the identification ( [ j_ij ] ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is then the following : in section [ homog ] we remind the main properties of the hamiltonian ( [ inh_ham ] ) in the homogeneous limit ( @xmath23 ) and we recall how the vortex degrees of freedom are introduced . the effect of inhomogeneities is addressed in section [ inhomog ] , where we present numerical results for the spatial correlations and the number of vortex lines , pointing out that the vortex lines are expelled from the region with large couplings .",
    "results with an external magnetic field are also presented .",
    "our conclusions , together with a discussion of perspectives and future work , are presented in section [ concl ] .",
    "in this section we recall the main properties of the hamiltonian ( [ inh_ham ] ) in the homogeneous limit , i.e. when the couplings @xmath22 are taken equal to some value @xmath30 , so that ( [ inh_ham ] ) reads @xmath31 we observe ( [ hom_ham ] ) can be written as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "a detailed discussion of several properties of the three - dimensional @xmath1 model is in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 hamiltonian ( [ hom_ham ] ) displays a phase transitions , belonging to the @xmath34 universality class at a critical temperature @xmath35 in which the order parameter @xmath36 becomes non - vanishing : accurate monte carlo estimates give @xcite @xmath37 i.e. @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 ) .    a simple estimate of the @xmath35 can be obtained by mean - field @xcite : the mean - field hamiltonian reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of nearest - neighbours and @xmath42 is the parameter to be self - consistently determined .",
    "one has @xmath43 it follows @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath46-th modified bessel function @xcite . by performing the limit @xmath47",
    ", one finds the mean - field critical temperature @xmath48 which should be compared with ( [ crit_homog ] ) .    a useful way to go beyond mean - field results , both for the critical temperatures and the critical exponents ,",
    "is provided by rewriting hamiltonian ( [ hom_ham ] ) in terms of the correct topological excitations , the vortex loops . to this aim",
    ", one has to resort to dual transformations @xcite : details are found in @xcite , here we sketch the main steps in order to show how vortex loops emerge in the effective description of the system .",
    "the dual transform procedure is the same as in the two - dimensional @xmath1 model : the main point consists in expanding @xmath49 in terms of the basis eigenfunctions invariant with respect to the symmetry of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to write the hamiltonian ( [ hom_ham ] ) as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the discrete derivative in the direction @xmath52 , with @xmath53 denoting the versors in the three directions ( e.g. , @xmath54 , and so on ) . to write the hamiltonian ( [ re - wr ] ) in term of the dual variables , which turn out to be the vortex lines themselves , one has to introduce the lattice bond variables @xmath55 ( which are _ integer _",
    "variables ) and then integrate over the initial variables @xmath7 @xcite . expanding the boltzmann factor @xmath49 in terms of @xmath56 and integrating over the @xmath7 one gets a constraint , as in any dual transformation @xcite :",
    "the constraint to be satisfied is @xmath57 .",
    "one has then to write @xmath55 as the curl of a dual lattice bond variable in order to satisfy the constraint : using the poisson summation formula @xcite amounts then to introduce the vortex loop variables @xmath58 .",
    "this procedure is the equivalent of the duality transformation that in @xmath4 defines the coulomb gas hamiltonian , where the charges of the coulomb gas are the ( @xmath4 ) vortices @xcite .",
    "one finally gets for the partition function @xmath59 the effective hamiltonian is written in terms of the vortex loop variables @xmath58 and it reads @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the three - dimensional lattice green s function @xmath62 ( apart from a constant ) : @xmath63 , where for large distances it is @xmath64 @xcite . in eq.([ham_j ] ) @xmath65 at low temperatures ( the full dependence upon temperature is discussed in @xcite ) .    the vortex loop variables @xmath58 are vectors , having the three components @xmath66 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the components @xmath66 in each site @xmath67 of the dual lattice are integer variables @xmath68 at low temperatures only the values @xmath69 are relevant .",
    "one has the following local conservation law : @xmath70 meaning nothing but that the loops are closed .",
    "the physical meaning of the variables @xmath66 is that a vortex passes from one elementary cell cube of center @xmath67 to a neighbour cube of center @xmath71 if the sum of the phase differences ( @xmath72 ) across the square face separating the two cells has modulus @xmath21 , i.e. if a vortex line passes through the two centers ( from @xmath67 to @xmath71 if @xmath73 , and from @xmath71 to @xmath67 if @xmath74 ) . in the @xmath4 case",
    "the vector @xmath58 is a scalar , meaning that one has a counter - clockwise ( clockwise ) vortex around the plaquette center @xmath67 if the value is @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , i.e. one finds back the standard definition of @xmath4 vortices .    an important consequence of rewriting the hamiltonian in terms of the correct degrees of freedom",
    "@xmath66 is that it is possible , starting from ( [ ham_j ] ) , to perform a real - space renormalization study : scaling equations are obtained for the vortex - loop fugacity @xmath77 and the coupling @xmath78 as a function of the scale @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the final result is @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82}$ ] , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 the finite core size at scale @xmath79 .",
    "analysing eqs.([scaling ] ) , one can have a good estimate of the critical temperature and of the critical exponents @xcite .",
    "the emerging physical picture is the following : the three - dimensional @xmath1 model has vortex loops as topological excitations , with loop segments interacting via a @xmath85 potential .",
    "thermally created loops are few and small at low temperatures : when the temperature is increased the loops expand and smaller loops wedge between larger loops .",
    "this screening weakens the binding of larger loops , until the dominating largest loops are expelled at the critical temperature , with a proliferation of vortex loops .",
    "in this section we study the hamiltonian ( [ inh_ham ] ) with inhomogeneous couplings @xmath22 : to fix the notation , we consider in the following three kinds of inhomogeneity .",
    "first , we consider a gaussian radially symmetric coupling given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the distance ( hereafter measured in units of the lattice length ) from a chosen origin of the midpoint of the sites @xmath6 , @xmath18 ; @xmath88 is an overall coupling and @xmath89 is a length quantifying the spatial extent of the couplings @xmath22 .",
    "the choice ( [ j_1 ] ) refers to the physical situations in which an external potential forces the superfluid to stay close to the centre , as it is the case , e.g. , for trapped superfluids in parabolic potentials .",
    "another possible choice amounts to considering the inhomogeneity only in one direction : we set @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the distance from a chosen origin along the @xmath92 direction of the midpoint of @xmath6 and @xmath18 .",
    "the couplings ( [ j_2 ] ) correspond , in an ultracold atom setup , to a trap squeezed in the @xmath92 direction and refer to a superfluid occupying a certain `` slice '' of a three - dimensional system : this is the case also for the neutron superfluid in the crust of a ns . for this reason",
    ", we also consider as a third choice couplings @xmath22 proportional to the superfluid gap in the ns inner crust : we use the data for the gap in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained using the @xmath93 correlated model ( see table @xmath75 in @xcite ) . since in a ns",
    "the critical temperature is order of @xmath94 and the temperature @xmath95 is much smaller than @xmath35 , the relevant regime of temperatures to model ns through the hamiltonian ( [ inh_ham ] ) is the low - temperature one .",
    "denoting with @xmath92 the radial direction of the ns , the data from @xcite as a function of the distance @xmath91 from the centre of the inner crust are well fitted with a function @xmath96 .",
    "we will use then ( with @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) @xmath99 it should be noted that even if the xy model is usually formulated with two energy scales @xmath30 and @xmath95 , only their ratio has a physical meaning . therefore all of the results only depend on the adimensional parameter @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 in the homogeneous case ) .    as a starting point of the following discussion",
    ", we observe that in the homogeneous limit [ i.e. , @xmath23 in eq.([inh_ham ] ) ] the critical temperature @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath30 : for temperatures smaller than @xmath35 a few small vortex loops are thermally generated .",
    "if there is a shallow dependence of the couplings , one can consider that there is a space dependent value of the critical temperature for the vortex loop blow out .",
    "then , with the couplings varying across the lattice , as a consequence of the inhomogeneity , in the regions with small ( large ) coupling constants there are many ( few ) large ( small ) vortex loops .",
    "this can be rephrased in terms of a local density approximation ( lda ) , where the effective local temperature is @xmath102 . according to this picture",
    ", there should be many vortex loops in the regions in which the coupling is very small , e.g. , for large @xmath87 with the couplings ( [ j_1 ] ) : however , there are no superfluid particles there , as shown by eq.([j_ij ] ) , and an effective number of vortices will reach a maximum value at intermediate values of the couplings .",
    "one can think to the presence of regions with a maximum effective number of vortices as related to the occurrence of vortex - vortex interactions that are no longer translationally invariant and effectively attractive in the regions with intermediate values of the couplings .",
    "one can quantitatively test the validity of the lda by computing the local observables of interest in the homogeneous case for various temperatures and comparing the results with the local values of the same observables in the inhomogeneous system , with coupling @xmath103 as we show later in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "to quantitatively test and visualize the described scenario involving the effective exclusion of vortex loops from the regions with higher couplings , we numerically studied the hamiltonian ( [ inh_ham ] ) with the couplings ( [ j_1])-([j_3 ] ) by means of a monte carlo simulation with open boundary conditions .",
    "vortex lines were identified using the standard definition @xcite : a vortex passes from one elementary cell cube to a neighbour cell if the sum of the phase differences ( @xmath72 ) across the square face separating the two cells has modulus @xmath21 . in other words",
    ", if the face between two cubes has the four sites @xmath104 and phases @xmath105 , then one computes the quantity @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( with @xmath109 ) .",

    "the thickness of the lines is faded proportionally to the couplings @xmath22 , i.e. the full solid lines correspond to the maximum value of the couplings and no line is drawn in absence of coupling : different intensities of grey correspond to intermediate couplings @xcite .",
    "the simulation with homogeneous coupling is shown for comparison and it illustrates the nature of three - dimensional @xmath1 phases transition occurring at @xmath111 , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( below @xmath35 ) and fig.[fig2 ] ( above @xmath35 ) .",

    "the lda agrees well with the inhomogeneous results , so it is expected that local observables are accurately described by lda .",
    "[ fig8 ] clearly illustrates that the number of vortices @xmath144 is large in the region of small couplings ( where the correlation with the central region is vanishing ) : therefore we introduce an effective number , @xmath145 given by @xmath146 the fig .",

    "in this paper we studied the distribution of vortex lines in inhomogeneous three - dimensional lattices modelled by an @xmath1 model with spatially varying coupling constants .",
    "the motivation of our work was two - fold and related to the superfluid properties of rotating trapped ultracold atoms in optical lattices and rotating neutron stars .",
    "indeed the low - energy properties of ultracold atoms in deep optical lattices are in general described by hubbard - like models : in the superfluid phase , either due to temperature and/or to the effect of a rotation , vortex lines will develop in the system .",
    "since an external potential is usually present in order to trap these systems , then an arising issue is the determination of how the trapping potential affects the distribution vortex lines .",
    "the study the effect of inhomogeneities on the vortex lines in superfluids in a lattice is also relevant in the context of neutron stars .",
    "theoretical calculations and indirect observational evidence support the idea that crustal free neutrons form a superfluid .",
    "since the inhomogeneous neutron superfluid in the inner crust has a gap exhibiting a strong spatial dependence and it is experiencing the periodic potential created by the lattice of very neutron rich nuclei , then an interesting problem is the study of the effect of the inhomogeneity on the vortex lines in the inner crust . also relevant",
    "would possibly be the individuation of a simplified model capturing the main properties of vortex lines in neutron stars .",
    "we have presented results for the spatial distribution of the number of vortex lines , showing how the vortex lines are expelled from the region with higher couplings .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that in the homogeneous limit the critical temperature @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath30 and for temperatures smaller than @xmath35 a few small vortex loops are thermally generated . in presence of inhomogeneity , there is a space dependent value of the temperature value at which the vortex loops start to blow out ; thus , with the couplings varying across the lattice , in the regions with small coupling constants vortex loops accumulate , while in contrast vortices are expelled from the regions with large couplings . defining an effective number of vortices to take into account that where the coupling is small the number of superfluid particles is also small , one has that the effective number of vortices will reach a maximum value at intermediate values of the couplings .",
    "results for the correlation functions and in presence of a strong external magnetic field ( or strong rotation for neutral superfluids ) are also presented ,    as a future work , it would be interesting to determine the vortex - vortex interaction in presence of inhomogeneities and/or dislocations : from this point it would be useful to write the inhomogeneous hamiltonian in terms of dual variables and write the vortex - vortex interactions starting from the ( inhomogeneous ) lattice green s functions .",
    "the corresponding results would then allow for the determination of the effective size of the region with an appreciable effective number of vortices .",
    "equally interesting would also be the systematic study of the effects of an ( eventually frustrated ) external magnetic field .    in perspective",
    ", we think that a promising line of work is the extension of the results obtained in this paper using a simplified @xmath1 toy model to quantitatively study vortex behaviour in rotating neutron star crusts .",
    "attempts in this direction have been made using a phenomenological gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "the planned extension consists in writing an effective hamiltonian for the superfluid neutrons put in rotation and feeling an effective inhomogeneous periodic potential : the superfluid dynamics will be then described by a simplified ( @xmath1-like ) model having parameters determined from the underlying microscopic fermionic hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting model could be used to make predictions for observable quantities and comparisons with available data , with the aim to improve the current state of the art both in terms of modelling and of input parameters .",
    "using numerical results from microphysical simulations as inputs , for the pairing gap , the effective lattice potential and the inter - particle interaction , one could be then able to study the behaviour of vortices in a realistic way and hopefully bridge the gap between the astrophysical vast dataset and the many - body theoretical picture describing the crust .",
