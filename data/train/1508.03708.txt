    "the amplifier is clearly one of the most important components incorporated in almost all current technological devices .",
    "the basic function of an autonomous amplifier is simply to transform an input signal @xmath0 to @xmath1 with gain @xmath2 .",
    "however , such an amplifier is fragile in the sense that the device parameters change easily , and eventually distortion occurs in the output @xmath3 .",
    "this was indeed a most serious issue which had prevented any practical use of amplifiers in , e.g. , telecommunication .",
    "fortunately , this issue was finally resolved back in 1927 by black @xcite ; there are a huge number of textbooks and articles reviewing this revolutionary work , and here we refer to refs .",
    "the key idea is the use of feedback shown in fig .  1 ;",
    "that is , an autonomous amplifier called the  plant \" is combined with a  controller \" in such a way that a portion of the plant s output is fed back to the plant through the controller . then the output of the whole controlled system is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gain of the controller .",
    "now , if the plant has a large gain @xmath6 , it immediately follows that @xmath7 .",
    "hence , the whole system works as an amplifier , simply provided that the controller is a passive device ( i.e. , an attenuator ) with @xmath8 .",
    "importantly , a passive device such as a resistor is very robust , and its parameters contained in @xmath5 almost do not change .",
    "this is the mechanism of robust amplification realized by feedback control .",
    "note , of course , that this feedback architecture is the core of an operational amplifier ( op - amp ) .",
    "is the gain of an autonomous amplifier , and @xmath5 is the gain of a passive controller .",
    ", width=321 ]    surely there is no doubt about the importance of quantum amplifiers .",
    "a pertinent quantum counterpart to the classical amplifier is the _ phase - preserving linear amplifier _",
    "@xcite ( in what follows , we simply call it the  amplifier \" ) .",
    "in fact , this system has a crucial role in diverse quantum technologies such as communication , weak - signal detection , and state processing @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent substantial progress in both theory and experiments @xcite has further advanced this field .",
    "an important fact is that , however , an amplifier must be an active system powered by external energy sources , implying that its parameters are fragile and can change easily .",
    "because of this parameter fluctuation , the amplified output signal or state suffers from distortion @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the practical applicability of the quantum amplification is still severely limited .",
    "that is , we are now facing the same problem we had 90 years ago .    to make the discussion clear ,",
    "let us here describe the general quantum - amplification process .",
    "ideally the amplifier transforms a bosonic input mode @xmath9 to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an auxiliary mode , and the coefficients satisfy @xmath12 from @xmath13=1 $ ] .",
    "hence , the output @xmath14 is an amplified mode of @xmath9 with gain @xmath15 .",
    "a typical example of an amplifier is the optical nondegenerate parametric amplifier ( ndpa ) , in which case @xmath16 and @xmath17 are frequency dependent as shown later .",
    "however , note again that the system parameters , especially the coupling strength of the pumped crystal , can not be kept exactly constant , and eventually the amplified output mode @xmath14 has to be distorted .",
    "now the motivation is clear ; we need a quantum version of the feedback - amplification method described in the first paragraph .",
    "the contribution of this paper is , in fact , to develop a general theory for quantum feedback amplification that resolves the fragility issue of quantum amplifiers .",
    "the key idea is simple and easy to implement , i.e. , _ feedback of the auxiliary output mode @xmath18 through a passive controller to the auxiliary input mode @xmath11_. indeed , it is proven that the whole controlled system possesses a strong robustness property against parameter fluctuations , which thus enables quantum amplifiers to be implemented at a practical level .",
    "this type of control scheme is , in general , called the _ coherent feedback _",
    "@xcite , meaning that an output field is fed back to an input field through another quantum system without involving any measurement process ; hence , an excess classical noise is not introduced in the feedback loop .",
    "now note that the auxiliary output @xmath18 has some information about @xmath14 due to their entanglement , though @xmath18 is usually thrown away in the scenario of quantum amplification .",
    "thus , we have an interpretation that the presented scheme utilizes the _ signal - recycling _ technique @xcite for reducing the sensitivity , unlike the conventional use of it for enhancing the sensitivity of the gravitational - wave detector .",
    "in addition to the above - described main contribution , some important results are obtained .",
    "first , we see that the controlled system reaches the fundamental quantum noise limit @xcite even if some imperfections are present in the feedback loop .",
    "this means that precise fabrication of the feedback control is not necessary , which thus again emphasizes the feasibility of the presented scheme .",
    "next , this paper proposes a type of ndpa subjected to a special detuning that circumvents the usual gain - bandwidth trade - off in the amplification process .",
    "a drawback of this modified amplifier is that , as will be shown , it is very sensitive to the parameter fluctuation .",
    "the presented theory has a distinct advantage in such a situation ; that is , this issue can now be resolved by constructing a feedback loop .",
    "therefore , as a concrete application of the theory , this paper proposes a robust , near - minimum - noise , and broadband amplifier .    finally , note that there are a variety of quantum amplifiers considered in the literature such as an optical back - action evasion amplifier @xcite ; however , the schematic presented in this paper is essentially different from all those modifications in the following sense .",
    "while those modified amplifiers have their own purposes for improving the performance or achieving the goal in some specific subjects ( e.g. back - action evasion ) , the feedback scheme is a device - independent and purpose - independent fundamental architecture that must be incorporated in all amplifiers .",
    "in fact , in the classical regime , the  operation \" part of an op - amp has its own purpose ( e.g. , differentiation and integration ) , but any op - amp does not work without feedback .",
    "let us begin with a specific model : the ndpa .",
    "this is an optical cavity system with two internal modes @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "they are orthogonally polarized and obey the following hamiltonian : @xmath21 with @xmath22 the coupling strength between the modes , @xmath23 the resonant frequencies of @xmath24 , and @xmath25 the pump frequency .",
    "also , in the above expression the rotating - wave approximation is taken under the assumption @xmath26 .",
    "the system couples with a signal input @xmath9 and an auxiliary ( idler ) input @xmath11 with strength @xmath27 .",
    "then , in the rotating frame at frequency @xmath28 , the dynamics of the ndpa is given by the following langevin equations @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are detuning .",
    "also , the output equations ( boundary conditions ) are given by @xmath32 now the laplace transformation of an observable @xmath33 in the heisenberg picture is defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "then the laplace transforms of @xmath9 , etc . , are connected by the following linear equations : @xmath36 the stability analysis can be conducted in the laplace domain ; that is , for the amplifier to be stable , all roots of the characteristic equations of the transfer functions ( i.e. , _ poles _ ) must lie in the left - hand complex plane . in the above case ,",
    "particularly when @xmath37 , the characteristic equation is @xmath38 ; hence , @xmath39 must be satisfied to guarantee the stability of the ndpa .",
    "the quantum - amplification process is described in the fourier domain @xmath40 with @xmath41 the frequency ; that is , we consider the linear transformation at the steady state , @xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath16 and @xmath17 satisfy @xmath43 for all @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath37 , the amplification gain at the resonant frequency @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 and it takes a large number nearly at the threshold @xmath46 .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is in fact an amplified mode of @xmath9 with gain @xmath47 .",
    "the above example can be generalized ; any phase - preserving linear quantum amplifier is modeled as an open dynamical system with two inputs and two outputs .",
    "let us represent the input - output relation in the laplace domain as follows : @xmath48        = g(s ) \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }                       b_1(s ) \\\\",

    "the transfer function matrix @xmath50 at @xmath40 ( i.e. the scattering matrix ) satisfies @xmath51 thus , @xmath52 represents the amplification gain .",
    "( plant ) .",
    "@xmath53 , and @xmath54 are unwanted noisy input fields .",
    ", width=272 ]    our control scheme is based on coherent feedback ; that is , the controller is also given by a quantum system and is connected to the plant through the input and output fields .",
    "note that , if a measurement process is involved in the feedback loop , it inevitably introduces additional noise .",
    "now we take a passive system ( e.g. a beam splitter and an optical cavity ) as the controller , with two inputs @xmath55 and two outputs @xmath56 ; note that a single - input and single - output passive system has a gain equal to 1 and thus does not work as an attenuator .",
    "we represent the input - output relation of this system in the laplace domain as follows : @xmath57         = k(s )   \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }                       b_3^\\dagger(s ) \\\\",

    "because of the passivity property , the transfer function matrix @xmath58 is unitary in the fourier domain ; i.e. , @xmath59 holds for all @xmath41 .",
    "we now consider connecting the controller to the plant .",
    "but unlike the classical case , where both the plant and the controller can be a single input - output system and arbitrary split or addition of signal is allowed , designing a feedback scheme in the quantum case is not trivial .",
    "for example , we could divide @xmath14 into two paths by a beam splitter and use one of them for feedback purpose , but in this case the resultant whole controlled system is not a minimum - noise amplifier .",

    "ii , for the whole controlled system to be stable , the controller should be carefully designed so that all poles of @xmath70 must lie in the left - hand complex plane , as demonstrated in sec .",
    "v.      we now focus on the output of the controlled system in the fourier domain , i.e. , @xmath71 and the amplification gain @xmath72 especially when the original gain @xmath52 is large . note that @xmath73 looks somewhat different from the classical counterpart ; hence , it is not immediate to see if @xmath72 can be approximated by a function of only the controller . nonetheless , the analogous result to the classical case indeed holds as shown below .    for the proof we use eq .",
    "( below , we omit the variable @xmath74 ) .",
    "first , from @xmath75 together with the other two equations , we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "also @xmath78 holds . here , in the limit @xmath79",
    ", it follows that @xmath80 this implies that @xmath81 converges to zero in this limit . as a consequence , we have @xmath82 hence , in the frequency range where the plant has a large gain @xmath83 , the whole controlled system amplifies the input @xmath84 with gain @xmath85 .",
    "therefore we obtain the desirable quantum robust amplification method via feedback ; that is , thanks to the fact that the passive controller is much more robust compared to the original amplifier , even if @xmath86 changes while maintaining a large value , the whole controlled system carries out robust amplification with stable gain @xmath87 .      here",
    "we conduct a quantitative analysis on the robustness property , which provides a guideline for synthesizing the feedback gain @xmath5 .",
    "to see the idea clearly , let us again consider the classical case .",
    "let @xmath88 be the fluctuation that occurs in the plant @xmath89 ; then the fluctuation that occurs in the whole controlled system @xmath90 is calculated as @xmath91 which as a result leads to @xmath92 hence , the gain sensitivity to the unwanted fluctuation can be reduced by the factor @xmath93 by feedback .",
    "equation suggests to us not to design @xmath89 and @xmath5 separately ; rather , what determines the performance of the controlled amplifier is the _ loop gain _ @xmath94 .",
    "actually , while the controlled amplification gain , @xmath95 , can be made bigger by taking a smaller value of @xmath5 , we should not design a too small @xmath5 such that @xmath96 ; in this case , eq .   yields @xmath97 , and thus there is no improvement in the sensitivity .",
    "the so - called _ bode plot _ developed by bode ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is a powerful graphical method for synthesizing @xmath5 as well as @xmath89 , and it is now the standard tool for general feedback circuit design .",
    "now let us try to establish the quantum version of the above discussion .",
    "note in advance that a straightforward calculation , like eq .",
    ", can not be carried out in the quantum case , but nonetheless a similar useful equation for determining the controller parameter @xmath98 is shown .",
    "first , due to @xmath76 and @xmath78 , we find @xmath99 which thus leads to @xmath100 the fluctuation of the controlled gain is given by @xmath101 then , from the general relation @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the normalized fluctuation of the amplification gain of the controlled system can be explicitly calculated as @xmath105 next , noting that @xmath106 and thus @xmath107 , we find from eq .",
    "that @xmath108 thus , from the general relation @xmath109 with @xmath110 , it follows that @xmath111    equation has a similar form to eq .   and indeed provides us a guideline for feedback design .",
    "that is , as in the classical case , the balance of @xmath98 and @xmath112 determines the ability of the controlled system to suppress the fluctuation ( note that @xmath113 ) .",
    "in particular , we now deduce a similar conclusion as in the classical case ; if we choose a too small @xmath98 in addition to @xmath114 such that the loop gain @xmath115 is almost zero , then substituting the relation @xmath116 into eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath117 .",
    "that is , in this case the fluctuation is not at all suppressed via feedback . to design an appropriate controller gain @xmath98 , the bode plot of the loop gain @xmath118 is useful",
    "let us define the noise magnitude of @xmath119 by @xmath120 then , through the ideal amplification process @xmath10 , the noise magnitude must be also amplified as @xmath121 , where @xmath11 is assumed to be in the vacuum .",
    "this implies the degradation of the signal - to - noise ratio : @xmath122 hence , the _ added noise _ @xmath123 quantifies the fidelity of the amplification process @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in the large amplification limit @xmath124 we find @xmath125 , which is called the _ quantum noise limit_.    up to now , the ideal setup is assumed , and the controlled system is driven by only the signal @xmath9 and the auxiliary input @xmath126 , implying that it actually reaches the quantum noise limit in the large amplification limit .",
    "hence , here we consider the following general case where some excess noise exists , as illustrated in fig .  2 ;",
    "the plant is subjected to an unwanted noise @xmath127 that enters into the system in the form @xmath128 ; the controller is also affected by a noise @xmath129 ; furthermore , the feedback transmission lines are lossy , which is modeled by inserting fictitious beam splitters with additional inputs @xmath130 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath63 are all annihilation modes .",
    "then the output of the whole controlled system has the form @xmath131 then , if the excess noises are all vacuum , the added noise in the feedback - controlled amplification process , denoted by @xmath132 , satisfies @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the added noise of the plant . the proof of eq .  , including the detailed forms of @xmath135 , is given in appendix  a. this is a very useful result for the following reasons .",
    "first , in the large amplification limit the two added noises @xmath132 and @xmath134 are equal ; as a consequence the second term in the right - hand side of eq .   is a function of only the plant and can not be further altered by feedback control .",
    "hence , we have the following no - go theorem : if the original amplifier does not reach the quantum noise limit ( i.e. , @xmath136 ) , the controller can never remove this excess noise . on the other hand ,",
    "notably , the imperfections contained in the controller and the feedback transmission lines do not appear in eq .  .",
    "this means that a very accurate fabrication of the feedback controller is not necessarily required , which is a desirable fact from a practical viewpoint .",
    "thus , if the original amplifier operates with the minimum added noise , the controlled system reaches the quantum noise limit as well even if some imperfections are present in the feedback loop .",
    "in any practical situation , it is important to carefully engineer an amplifier so that it has a proper frequency bandwidth in which nearly constant amplification gain is realized . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known in both the classical and quantum cases that , particularly for an amplifier with a single pole , the effective bandwidth becomes smaller if the amplification gain is taken to be bigger .",
    "that is , there is a _ gain - bandwidth constraint_. however , this constraint is not necessarily applied to a more complex amplifier with multiple poles .",
    "in fact , recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors propose a hybrid amplifier composed of two cavity modes and an additional opto - mechanical mode that circumvents the gain - bandwidth constraint . in this section ,",
    "we study another system that is also free from this constraint , that yet does not need an additional degree of freedom .",
    "then , the effectiveness of feedback is discussed , demonstrating its ability to make the system robust .       and various @xmath137 . , width=332 ]    the plant system is the ndpa with dynamics , and output .",
    "here we consider the ideal case where the unwanted noises @xmath63 shown in fig .",
    "2 are not present . without any invention ,",
    "this system is subject to a gain - bandwidth constraint @xcite , but now let us take the specific detuning as @xmath138 .",
    "the transfer function matrix of this system is then given by @xmath139.\\ ] ] the maximum gain is @xmath140 , which becomes larger by increasing @xmath141 .",
    "remarkably , this amplification can be carried out without sacrificing the bandwidth .",
    "figure  3 ( a ) shows the three cases corresponding to @xmath142 , all of which have the same effective bandwidth @xmath143 . a clear advantage of this system is in its implementability ; that is , it is composed of only optical devices , and there is no need to prepare an auxiliary system such as an opto - mechanical oscillator . also , note that the system is always stable ( the pole of the transfer function matrix is @xmath144 ) ; that is , in a proper parameter regime such that the linearized model given by eqs .   and is valid , must be much smaller than the optical frequencies @xmath145 ( see sec .",
    "ii ) . also , in a strong coupling regime such that @xmath146 holds , the third - order nonlinearity contained in the hamiltonian becomes effective , and the linearized model and is then not valid anymore .",
    "taking into account these facts , in the simulation , we take a relatively small value of @xmath141 , i.e. , @xmath142 , which is typically of the order of megahertz . ]",
    "there is no clear upper bound on @xmath141 , in contrast to the standard ndpa which imposes @xmath147 .       back to the auxiliary input @xmath11 through",
    "just a beam splitter , the robustness property is drastically improved , as discussed in the main text .",

    ", width=328 ]    as repeatedly emphasized in this paper , the main strength of feedback is that the controlled system possesses a robustness property . to see this ,",
    "let us consider an imperfect case as follows .",
    "first , the device parameters are fragile ; the coupling strength @xmath141 fluctuates in such a way that @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the nominal value ; similarly , the detunings @xmath168 and @xmath169 can be slightly deviated from @xmath141 , which is modeled by @xmath170 and @xmath171 . here",
    "@xmath172 are independent random variables subjected to the uniform distribution in @xmath173 $ ] .",
    "in addition to this fragility , we assume that the signal mode @xmath19 is subjected to optical loss , which is modeled by adding the extra term @xmath174 to the right - hand side of eq .  , with @xmath175 the magnitude of the loss and @xmath127 the unwanted vacuum noise .",
    "the feedback transmission lines are also lossy , which is modeled by eq .  .    the blue lines in fig",
    "5 are 50 sample values of the autonomous gain @xmath52 in the case @xmath165 and @xmath176 .",
    "that is , in fact , due to the parameter fluctuation described above , the amplifier becomes fragile and the amplification gain significantly varies .",
    "nonetheless , this fluctuation can be suppressed by feedback ; the red lines in fig .",
    "5 are 50 sample values of the controlled gain @xmath164 with attenuation level @xmath161 , whose fluctuation is indeed much smaller than that of @xmath52 .",
    "can be suppressed at least by a factor of @xmath177 . but",
    "this means that eq .",
    "is conservative , since fig .",
    "5 shows that the fluctuation is suppressed about by a factor of 0.2 . ]",
    "( note that , because the fluctuation of @xmath164 is very small , the set of sample values looks like a thick line . ) that is , the controlled system is certainly robust against the realistic fluctuation of the device parameters .       and that of the non - controlled one ( i.e. , @xmath163 ) versus ( a ) @xmath178 with fixed @xmath179 , and ( b ) @xmath180 with fixed @xmath178 . in both figures , the red solid lines represent @xmath132 , while the blue dotted lines are @xmath134 , at @xmath44 . ,",
    "width=332 ]    finally , let us investigate how much the excess noise is added to the output of the controlled or noncontrolled specially detuned ndpa .",
    "again we set @xmath165 , and the feedback control is conducted with attenuation level @xmath161 .",
    "also , the same imperfections considered in the previous subsection are assumed ; that is , the system suffers from the signal loss ( represented with @xmath175 ) and the probabilistic fluctuation of the parameters ( @xmath181 ) ; furthermore , the feedback control is implemented with the lossy transmission lines ( represented with @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) .    with this setup fig .",
    "6 is obtained , where the red solid lines are sample values of the added noise at the center frequency @xmath44 for the controlled system , @xmath132 given by eq .",
    ", while the blue dotted lines represent those of the non - controlled system , @xmath134 given by eq .  .",
    "( in the figure it appears that six thick lines are plotted , but each is the set of 50 sample values . )",
    "figure  6  ( a ) shows @xmath132 and @xmath134 versus the signal loss rate @xmath178 , where for the controlled system we fix @xmath179 ( that is , the feedback transmission lines are very lossy ) . also , fig .  6  ( b ) shows the added noise as a function of @xmath180 , with fixed signal loss @xmath178 .",
    "the first crucial point is that , in both figures ( a ) and ( b ) , @xmath132 and @xmath134 are close to each other .",
    "this is the fact that can be expected from eq .  , which states that @xmath132 and @xmath134 coincide in the large amplification limit .",
    "it is also notable that , for all sample values , @xmath132 is smaller than @xmath134 in the denominator and @xmath184 in the numerator",

    ", upper bounded by @xmath186 , while , from eq .",

    "hence , if both of these upper bounds are reached , together with the relation @xmath189 observed in the figure , eq .   yields @xmath190 , which means @xmath191 in the large amplification limit . ] ; in other words , the feedback controller reduces the added noise , although in the large amplification limit this effect becomes negligible as proven in eq .  .",
    "another important feature is that , as seen in fig .  6  ( a ) , the signal loss @xmath175 is the dominant factor increasing the added noise , and the feedback loss @xmath192 does not have a large impact on it , as seen in fig .  6  ( b ) . as consequence ,",
    "when @xmath175 is small , the controlled amplifier can perform amplification nearly at the quantum noise limit @xmath193 , with almost no dependence on the feedback loss ; this fact is also consistent with eq .  .",
    "in summary , the specially detuned ndpa with feedback control functions as a robust , near - minimum - noise ( if @xmath194 ) , and broadband amplifier .",
    "the presented feedback control theory resolves the critical fragility issue in phase - preserving linear quantum amplifiers .",
    "the theory is general and thus applicable to many different physical setups , such as optics , opto - mechanics , superconducting circuits , and their hybridization .",
    "moreover , the feedback scheme is simple and easy to implement , as demonstrated in sec .",
    "v. note also that the case of _ phase - conjugating amplification _",
    "@xcite can be discussed in a similar way ; see appendix  c.    in a practical setting , the controller synthesis problem becomes complicated , implying the need to develop a more sophisticated quantum feedback amplification theory , which indeed was established in the classical case @xcite .",
    "the combination of those classical approaches with the quantum control theory @xcite should advance this research direction .",
    "another interesting future work is to study genuine quantum - mechanical settings , e.g. , probabilistic amplification @xcite .",
    "finally , note that feedback control is used in order to reach the quantum noise limit , in a different amplification scheme ( the so - called op - amp mode ) @xcite ; connection to these works is also to be investigated .",
    "this work was supported in part by jsps grant - in - aid no .",
    "here we derive some preliminary results that are used later . first , eq",
    ".   leads to @xmath210 ; together with the other two equations , we then have @xmath211 similarly , @xmath212 furthermore , we can prove that @xmath213 never hold in the limit of @xmath79 as follows . if @xmath213 , this leads to @xmath214 and @xmath215 , and furthermore , @xmath216 and @xmath217 from eqs .   and ; then using eq .",
    "we have @xmath218 and accordingly @xmath219 , which leads to a contradiction .",
    "now we are concerned with the amplification gain @xmath220 in the limit @xmath79 .",
    "it is given by @xmath221 the second term is upper bounded , because from eq .",
    "@xmath222 and also @xmath223 does not converge to zero .",
    "therefore , we need @xmath224 ( hence , @xmath225 ) to have the condition @xmath226 .    finally , the added noise in the controlled system is computed as follows : @xmath227 where eq .",
    "is used ; also note that all the noise fields are now vacuum .",
    "the third term is given by @xmath228 then from eq .",
    "we find @xmath229 in the limit @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "also @xmath230 holds due to eq .  .",
    "as consequence , the added noise in the limit @xmath231 is given by @xmath232 hence , together with eq .  , we obtain eq .  .",
    "the point of this result is that , due to the strong constraint on the noise input fields , which is represented by eq .",
    ", the added noise does not explicitly contain the terms that stem from the creation input modes @xmath233 , and @xmath234 .",
    "this is because of the passivity property of the controller and the feedback transmission lines that are composed of only the creation modes .",
    "note that , as demonstrated above , in general the stability analysis becomes complicated for a complex - coefficient or higher - order transfer function .",
    "the _ nyquist method _",
    "@xcite is a very useful graphical tool that can deal with such cases , although an exact stability condition is not available .",
    "another way is a time - domain approach based on the so - called _ small - gain theorem _",
    "@xcite , that produces a sufficient condition for a feedback - controlled system to be stable ; the quantum version of this method @xcite will be useful to test the stability of the controlled feedback amplifier .",
    "the hermitian conjugate of the second element of eq .",
    "( 3 ) is given by @xmath243 .",
    "that is , the output @xmath18 is the amplified signal of the conjugated input @xmath244 , with gain @xmath245 ; this is called the phase - conjugating amplification .",
    "the feedback control in this case is almost the same as for the phase - preserving amplification .",
    "we consider the ideal feedback configuration shown in fig .  2 ( i.e.",
    ", the noise fields @xmath246 are ignored ) and now focus on the auxiliary output @xmath247 . then the amplification gain is evaluated , in the large amplification limit @xmath248 , as @xmath249 in the first line of the above equation , we have used @xmath250 ; also the last equality comes from the unitarity of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath251 .",
    "therefore , when the original amplification gain is large ( @xmath252 ) , the controlled system works as a phase - conjugating amplifier with gain @xmath253 . as in the phase - preserving case , this controlled gain is robust compared to the original one @xmath245 .",
