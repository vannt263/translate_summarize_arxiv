    "the x - ray dips reported here are considerably deeper ( down to @xmath28%  of the out - of - dip intensity ) and have much shorter duration ( @xmath2minutes ) . a preliminary announcement of the dips in groj1655@xmath040 observed by rxte has already been given by kuulkers et al .",

    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) pointed out similarities in the x - ray behavior between 4u1630@xmath047 and groj1655@xmath040 , and postulated that they are similar kind of systems .",
    "the rxte pca ( bradt , rothschild , &  swank @xcite ) performed a public target of opportunity observations of 4u1630@xmath047 on 1996 may 3 20:4922:41  utc , and of groj1655@xmath040 on 1997 february 26 19:3423:30  utc .",
    "the data were collected with a time resolution of 16s ( 129 photon energy channels , covering 2.060kev ) and 125@xmath4s ( 3 energy channels , covering 2.05.08.713.0kev ) .",

    "all x - ray spectral fits were performed in the range 230kev ( out of dip ) or 220kev ( dip ) , and a 2%  uncertainty was included in the data to account for uncertainties in the pca response matrix ( see e.g. , belloni et al .",
    "the x - ray spectra were corrected for background and dead time .",

    "we used the results provided by the rxte asm team , covering the period from 1996 february 21 to 1997 jun 19 .",
    "the 2.013.0kev count rates of groj1655@xmath040 and 4u1630@xmath047 were generally @xmath211500ctss@xmath6 and @xmath23000ctss@xmath6 , respectively",
    ". however , both sources showed sharp deep drops in their count rates down to @xmath21000ctss@xmath6 , lasting @xmath25060s for groj1655@xmath040 ( two events ) , and @xmath2140s for 4u1630@xmath047 ( one event ) , preceded and followed by short dips ( fig .  1 , upper panel ) .",
    "we will refer to the out - of - dip count rate as the `` persistent emission '' ( pe ) .",
    "the fall time scales of the main dips of groj1655@xmath040 are 24s , while the rise time scales are 35s . the hardness curve ( fig .  1 , lower left panel ) and corresponding hardness vs.  intensity diagram ( hid , fig .",
    "2 , upper panel ) of groj1655@xmath040 show that as the intensity drops the x - ray spectrum becomes much harder , until a certain threshold count rate of @xmath22000ctss@xmath6 is reached . during the last part of the fall the spectrum softens again to almost the same value as the pe level .",
    "the reverse behaviour is seen during the rise of the dips . in the hid",
    "the source always follows the same loop , also during the small pre- and after - dips and during the short spike in the second dip .    the fall and rise time scale of the main dip of 4u1630@xmath047 are @xmath23s . during its main dip",
    "several small flares occurred . the light curve and hardness behavior ( fig .  1 , lower right panel ; fig .  2 , lower panel ) of 4u1630@xmath047",
    "resembles that of groj1655@xmath040 . below a certain threshold count rate the hardness is positively correlated with intensity .",
    "however , the change in hardness between the persistent and threshold count rate is much smaller than that observed in groj1655@xmath040 . below the threshold count rate",
    "the hardness drops below the persistent value .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the rxte asm light curve of the individual 90s dwells for groj1655@xmath040 .",
    "12 clear drops in the 2 - 12kev intensity can be seen down by @xmath22595% . during these dips the spectral hardness increases .",
    "the occurrences of the asm and pca dips ( table  1 ) are best fit with a period of 2.6213@xmath70.0005 days ( 1@xmath8 ) .",
    "all these dips occurred between photometric orbital phases 0.72 and 0.86 ( table  1 ) .",
    "we constructed a series of @xmath2200sec x - ray spectra just outside the dips , and individual 16sec spectra at the bottom of the dips . because of the 16s time resolution we could not accumulate spectra during the rise and fall of the dips .",
    "the average count rates during the dip spectra are all below the threshold count rate",
    ".    fits to the pe with simple single - component models did not give acceptable results .",
    "we therefore used the model usually employed for black - hole candidates , i.e. , a disk - black body ( dbb ) plus a power law ( mitsuda et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which gave values of @xmath9@xmath12 . using the mean spectral fits ( table  2 ) we find that the persistent 230kev x - ray flux was @xmath22.5@xmath1010@xmath11 and @xmath25.8@xmath1010@xmath12erg@xmath13s@xmath6 , for groj1655@xmath040 and 4u1630@xmath047 , respectively .",
    "the spectral hardening between the pe count rate and the threshold value suggests that absorption is involved in the process giving rise to the dips . to verify this",
    ", we also made color - color diagrams ( cds , see fig .",
    "the data points for the two sources during the dips move from the crowded regions ( pe ) to the upper right part and then bend back to the lower left part of the cd ( in the case of 4u1630@xmath047 the data points bend back almost immediately ) .",
    "the bend - over point corresponds to the threshold count rate .",
    "we also plotted the calculated hardness values for the dbb and power - law component separately for a range of values of the inner disk temperature , @xmath14 , and of the power - law index , @xmath15 , with interstellar absorption column density , @xmath16 .",
    "fixed to the persistent value ( dashed lines in fig .  2 ) .",
    "with our choice of hardness ratios any linear combination of the two components has to lie between these two lines . only in the cd of groj1655@xmath040 part of the loop lies below the dbb line ; this requires an increase in the absorption column .",
    "homogeneous absorption of the persistent dbb and power - law components by cold material did not fit the dip spectra well , especially at low energies .",
    "the observed flux below @xmath26kev is much in excess from that expected in this model .",
    "we performed simple fits to the spectra by modelling this low energy excess either as a separate component ( power law or black body ) , or by partial absorption of the persistent components ( e.g.  marshall et al .",
    "we find that the persistent power - law component is absent during the dips .",
    "we focus on the fit results to the spectra at the bottom of the dips ( table  3 ) to investigate the low - energy excess , since there the absorption is expected to be largest .",
    "we fixed @xmath16 to the values derived from the pe fits , except when using the partial covering absorption model for 4u1630@xmath047 because this lead to an unstable fit . when using a power law to model the low - energy excess plus an absorbed dbb for the dip spectrum of 4u1630@xmath047",
    ", the inner disk radius , @xmath17 , could not be constrained and was , therefore , fixed to its pe value .",
    "the fits show that the shape and strength of the low - energy excess is very similar for both sources , and its contribution is only 67%of the pe flux .",
    "when the low - energy excess is modeled as a separate component , the dbb parameters are consistent with the pe values .",
    "when a partial covering model is used to describe the spectra , we get somewhat lower values for @xmath14 with respect to their pe values .",
    "depending on the model we find that the absorption of the dbb component increased up to @xmath225200@xmath1010@xmath18 and @xmath235300@xmath1010@xmath18@xmath13 at the lowest mean dip intensities in groj1655@xmath040 and 4u1630@xmath047 , respectively .    to see if we can qualitatively reproduce the observed shapes of the hid and cd , we calculated several sequences of x - ray spectra and determined intensity and hardness values .",
    "the out - of - dip spectrum was modeled by the persistent dbb component ( only subject to interstellar absorption ) as given in table  2 , plus the low - energy excess contribution modeled by a black body , as given in table  3 . in the dip",
    "we linearly increased the absorption of the persistent dbb component from zero up to 150 and 300@xmath1010@xmath18@xmath13 , for groj1655@xmath040 and 4u1630@xmath047 respectively , fixing the rest of the parameters to those given by the out - of - dip spectrum .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .  2 , and",
    "show that a gradual increase in absorption of the dbb component can reproduce the observed dip behavior .",
    "we have discovered short - term ( @xmath2minutes ) x - ray dipping behaviour of groj1655@xmath040 and 4u1630@xmath047 , down to @xmath28%  and @xmath230%  of the out - of - dip intensity , respectively .",
    "we found similar intensity drops in groj1655@xmath040 during 90s measurements with the rxte asm .",
    "the duration of the dips is of the same order of those found in cygx-1 and herx-1 ( e.g. , kitamoto et al .",
    "@xcite , leahy @xcite ) , but is shorter than typically seen in lmxb dip sources ( e.g. , parmar &  white 1988 ) .",
    "the best fit period of the occurrence of the dips observed in groj1655@xmath040 is consistent with the optical period of the system ( orosz &  bailyn 1997 , van der hooft et al .",
    "this therefore constitutes the first evidence of the orbital period in groj1655@xmath040 in x - rays .",
    "all these dips occurred between photometric orbital phases 0.72 and 0.86 .",
    "we note that the x - ray dip in groj1655@xmath040 seen with asca ( ueda et al .",
    "1997 ) occurred near photometric orbital phase 0.6 .",
    "the phasing of the occurrence of the x - ray dips is very similar to that observed in the low - mass x - ray binary dip sources ( e.g. , parmar &  white @xcite ) , which suggests a similar origin for the cause of the dips .",
    "the inclination of such sources which show only dips and no eclipses are in the range 6075@xmath19 ( e.g. , frank , king &  lasota @xcite ) .",
    "the inclination inferred for groj1655@xmath040 ( orosz &  bailyn @xcite , van der hooft et al .",
    "@xcite ) is in agreement with this .",
    "since the dip behavior of 4u1630@xmath047 is so similar to that seen in groj1655@xmath040 , we propose that 4u1630@xmath047 is also seen at a relatively high inclination , i.e.   6075@xmath19 .",
    "the observed dips are caused by an intervening medium absorbing the out - of - dip ( persistent ) emission ( pe ) .",
    "a simple neutral and uniform medium which heavily absorbs the pe , however , does not describe the spectra during the dips very well .",
    "the dip spectra can be best described by a heavily absorbed persistent component , plus a low - energy component which typically appears below @xmath26kev .",
    "such an extra low - energy component has also been reported by ueda et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in groj1655@xmath040 during their dip observed with asca , and has been seen during dips and eclipses in other low - mass and high - mass x - ray binaries ( sect .  1 ) .",
    "we modeled this so - called low - energy excess as a power law or a black body ( subject only to interstellar absorption ) , or alternatively by partial covering absorption of the persistent components .",
    "we find that the maximum absorption of the persistent components at the bottom of the dips ( @xmath225300@xmath1010@xmath18@xmath13 ) is comparable to that found during the long dip in groj1655@xmath040 observed with asca ( ueda et al .  1997 ) and the bottom of deep dips and/or eclipses of other binaries .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the low - energy excess during dips and/or eclipses ( e.g. , marshall et al .",
    "these include either a separate component which is not affected by the variable heavy absorption , or partial covering by a clumpy medium .",
    "the former has been proposed to be due to a scattering halo ( e.g. , kitamoto , miyamoto &  yamamoto @xcite ) , or ionized absorber models , in which the absorbing medium is sufficiently ionized to reduce the soft x - ray absorption ( e.g. , parmar &  white 1988 , marshall et al .",
    "we note that ueda et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported iron absorption lines during asca out - of - dip spectra of groj1655@xmath040 which suggests the presence of highly ionized plasma .",
    "alternatively , the low - energy excess may be the result of accumulating spectra over time scales longer than the intrinsic time scale for variability during the dips ( e.g. , parmar et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our spectral fits indicate that during the dips the persistent power - law component is absent .",
    "this suggests that the region where the bulk of the x - rays originate is not only subject to absorption , but that also the power - law emitting region is blocked from our view .",
    "interaction of the inflowing gas stream from the secondary with the outer edge of the disk may cause a thickening of the outer edge and/or material above the disk in the expected 0.60.0 phase range ( e.g. , parmar &  white @xcite ) and may well cause this absorption and shadowing .",
    "recently , greiner et al .  ( @xcite ) showed that the galatic superluminal source grs1915 + 105 had `` dipping '' behavior during its outbursts .",
    "the dipping activity in grs1915 + 105 is much more complex than that seen in our observations of groj1655@xmath040 and 4u1630@xmath047 .",
    "this dipping behavior has been proposed to be due to thermal - viscous instabilities in the inner disk ( belloni et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and is therefore not related to the dipping behavior we see in groj1655@xmath040 and 4u1630@xmath047 .      for groj1655@xmath040",
    "the system parameters have been well determined ( orosz &  bailyn 1997 , van der hooft et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this system",
    "the time scales of the dips imposes constraints on the sizes of the different emitting and absorbing media .",
    "the fall and rise time ( @xmath20@xmath23.5s ) constrain the size of the region which is `` obscured '' ; in fact , this gives an upper limit on the size , because the region over which the column density increases significantly also has a finite width ( leahy , yoshida , &  matsuoka @xcite ) .",
    "the duration of the dips ( @xmath21@xmath255sec ) constrains the size of the absorbing medium itself .    since @xmath20@xmath22@xmath21",
    ", we may assume that the absorbed x - ray source is much smaller than the absorbing medium .",
    "a medium which crosses a point - like central x - ray source may produce irregular x - ray dips , whereas crossing an extended region such as an accretion disk corona may produce smoother and longer energy independent modulations ( e.g. , parmar &  white @xcite ) . if the medium corotates in the binary frame and is located at a radius which is smaller than the outer disk radius ( @xmath23@xmath20.85r@xmath24 [ orosz &  bailyn 1997 ] , where r@xmath24 is the effective roche lobe radius of the black hole ) the upper limit on the size of the x - ray emitting region is @xmath2460 km .",
    "if the medium corotates with matter in the accretion disk ( i.e. , with a kepler velocity ) , the upper limit becomes @xmath21600 km .",
    "similar reasoning gives an approximate upper limit on the size of the absorbing medium of @xmath23800 km or @xmath237000 km , in the case of rotation within the binary frame or corotation in the accretion disk .",
    "if partial ionization of material in the disk causes the low - energy excess during the dips , one can roughly estimate the location of the absorbing material ( e.g. , parmar et al .",
    "for the material causing the intensity dips to be significantly ionized the ionization parameter @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the central source luminosity , @xmath27 the gas density of the cloud and @xmath28 the distance from the central source to the clouds ) must be larger than @xmath2100ergscms@xmath6 ( see hatchett , buff &  mccray @xcite ) . using a typical column density of @xmath2100@xmath1010@xmath18@xmath13 at the bottom of the dips , an out - of - dip luminosity of l@xmath293@xmath1010@xmath30ergss@xmath6 ( at a distance of 3.2kpc , hjellming &  rupen 1995 ) , and following parmar et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we derive that the material closer than @xmath23@xmath1010@xmath31 km from the x - ray source will be significantly ionized . assuming the absorbing medium is more or less spherical and has a fixed position in the binary system , one gets ( e.g. , remillard &  canizares @xcite ) @xmath32 , and therefore @xmath28@xmath15000 km .",
    "so , if ionization plays a role , the absorbing medium should be located in the inner part of the disk .",
    "frank et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that the low - energy excess is caused by scattering of x - rays in hot clouds which are the result of material from the accretion stream which skimmed over the disk and formed a ring near the central x - ray source .",
    "ionization may generate a two - phase medium which produce the dips .",
    "the expected circularization radius of the ring of material in this model is rather large for groj1655@xmath040 ( @xmath21@xmath1010@xmath33 km ) so that material in this ring can not be easily ionized .",
