    "description of interactions and correlations between excitons @xcite ( electron - hole pairs , @xmath5 ) is somewhat problematic because of their complicated statistics .",

    "einsetin ground state at sufficiently low density .",
    "@xcite however , their composite nature comes into play when the excitons overlap and `` partial '' exchanges ( of only a pair of electrons or holes ) can occur . and , unlike for charged complexes ( such as trions , @xmath6 ) naturally separated by the coulomb repulsion , the overlaps between neutral excitons can often be significant .    in the absence of a magnetic field @xmath7 ,",
    "exciton correlations have been discussed@xcite in connection with four - wave mixing experiments that involve two - photon absorption.@xcite here , we will consider 2d systems in the high-@xmath7 limit , so - called `` quantum hall systems.''@xcite while the bosonization scheme for excitons confined to the lowest landau level ( ll@xmath8 ) has recently been proposed , @xcite we will concentrate on the numerical results for the @xmath9@xmath9 interaction pseudopotential .    in ll@xmath8 ,",
    "a well - known statistics / correlation effect is the decoupling and condensation of @xmath10 excitons in the ground state of interacting electrons and holes.@xcite it can be interpreted in terms of an inter  exciton ( @xmath9@xmath9 ) exchange attraction exactly compensating for a decrease in the intra - exciton ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) attraction due to the phase space blocking for the coexisting identical constituent fermions .",
    "the exciton condensation in ll@xmath8 results from the mapping of an @xmath11@xmath12 system onto a two  spin system with spin - symmetric interactions.@xcite the `` hidden '' @xmath11@xmath12 symmetry corresponding to the conservation of the total spin and responsible for exciton condensation holds in ll@xmath8 because there the electron and hole orbitals are identical despite different effective masses ( in experimental systems with finite width , this also requires symmetric doping to avoid normal electric field that would split the @xmath11 and @xmath12 layers ) .",
    "the mapping between @xmath11@xmath12 and two - spin systems makes interband excitons in an empty ll@xmath8 equivalent to spin waves ( sw s ) in a filled ll@xmath8 , i.e. , in the quantum hall ground state with the filling factor @xmath13 .",
    "a sw ( or spin exciton ) consists of a hole in the spin - polarized ll@xmath8 and a reversed - spin electron in the same ll@xmath8 .",
    "although excitons and sw s in ll@xmath8 are formally equivalent and the conclusions of ref .",
    "and ours apply to both complexes , they are relevant for two different types of experiments ( photoluminescence and spin relaxation ) .    being charge - neutral , excitons move along straight lines and carry a linear wavevector @xmath2 even in a magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "the origin of their ( continuous ) dispersion@xcite @xmath14 in ll@xmath8 is not the ( constant ) @xmath11 or @xmath12 kinetic energy , but the dependence of an average @xmath11@xmath12 separation on @xmath2 .",
    "a moving exciton carries an electric dipole moment @xmath15 , proportional and orthogonal to both @xmath2 and @xmath7 .    for a pair of moving excitons",
    ", one could think that the dominant contribution to their interaction @xmath16 would be the dipole ",
    "dipole term,@xcite specially at small values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , when this term is too weak on the scale of @xmath14 to cause a significant polarization of the @xmath9 wavefunctions .",
    "such assumption would lead to the repulsion between excitons moving in the same direction .",
    "however , we show that this assumption is completely false because of the required ( anti)symmetry of the wavefunction of overlapping excitons under exchange of individual constituent electrons or holes .",
    "this statistics / correlation effect is significant even at small @xmath2 , and it reverses the sign of the @xmath9@xmath9 interaction , compared to the dipole  dipole term .",
    "specifically , excitons moving in the same direction attract one another , and the ground state of a pair of excitons carrying a total wavevector @xmath19 is a ( dynamically ) bound state with @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath9@xmath9 interaction pseudopotential is calculated numerically for two special cases : @xmath21 , corresponding to a pair of excitons moving with equal wavevectors @xmath22 in the same ( @xmath23 ) and opposite ( @xmath24 ) direction .",
    "in addition to the sign reversal , we find that the inclusion of the statistics effects leads to the significant weakening of the @xmath9@xmath9 interaction , specially at small @xmath2 ( e.g. , for the @xmath23 configuration .",
    "we find a @xmath25 power - law behavior ) .",
    "the near vanishing of the interaction between excitons moving in the same direction explains the occurrence of nearly linear multi - exciton bands found numerically in the spin - excitation spectra of finite - size quantum hall droplets @xcite and of extended quantum hall systems .",
    "@xcite and the attractive character of this interaction explains the slightly convex shape of these bands , which for a confined droplet leads to the oscillations of the total spin as a function of the magnetic field.@xcite",
    "we consider spin excitations at the filling factor @xmath13 , i.e. , in a system of @xmath26 electrons half - filling the lowest landau level ( ll@xmath8 ) single - particle angular momentum ( @xmath27 ) shell with two - fold spin degeneracy and the orbital degeneracy @xmath28 .",

    "the effective @xmath11@xmath12 interaction depends on @xmath45 at both even and odd values of @xmath30 , but it can be described more directly by an @xmath11@xmath12 pseudopotential ( pair @xmath11@xmath12 energy @xmath46 as a function of pair wavevector @xmath2 ) plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . in ll@xmath8 ,",
    "both @xmath11@xmath11 and @xmath11@xmath12 pseudopotentials are monotonic , while in higher ll s they have oscillations reflecting additional nodes of the single - particle wavefunctions .",
    "because of the exact mapping between two - spin and two - charge systems , all results discussed here are in principle applicable to systems of conduction electrons and valence holes .",
    "this equivalence is true for ideal systems ( with zero layer width @xmath47 and no ll mixing ) considered here .",
    "however , in realistic interband systems ( realized e.g.  by optical excitation of an electron gas ) the @xmath11 and @xmath12 wavefunctions are usually different both in the plane of motion ( because of mass - dependent ll mixing ) and in the normal direction ( because of mass - dependent density profiles @xmath48 and a spatial separation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 planes induced by an electric field produced by a charged doping layer ) .",
    "therefore , the `` hidden symmetry '' is usually broken in experimental @xmath11@xmath12 systems , while the equivalent conservation of the total spin @xmath49 is easily realized in the corresponding two - spin systems .",
    "an intriguing feature known to occur in the spin - excitation spectrum at @xmath13 is the low - energy band that is linear in spin and angular momentum .",
    "it was first identified in finite size quantum hall droplets , @xcite and later discussed@xcite in haldane spherical geometry,@xcite convenient in modeling infinite , translationally invariant systems .    as shown in fig .",

    "this band is nearly linear in @xmath51 and thus it can be interpreted as containing states of @xmath53 ordered and noninteracting sw s , each carrying angular momentum @xmath54 and energy @xmath55 , where @xmath56 ( and @xmath57 is the sphere radius ) .",
    "ordering means here that the angular momentum vectors of the @xmath53 sw s are all parallel to give a total @xmath58 , i.e. , that all sw s move in the same direction along the same great circle of the sphere . on a plane ( corresponding to @xmath59 ) , this corresponds to @xmath53 sw s moving in parallel along a straight line , each with an infinitesimal wavevector @xmath60 .",
    "scaling of this @xmath61 band with the size of the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , where we overlay the data for different @xmath62 .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath63 appears be a ( nearly size - independent ) linear function of `` spin polarization '' @xmath64 .",
    "assuming exact decoupling of sw s in this band , @xmath65 can be extrapolated to the planar geometry , where the sw dispersion is@xcite @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 being the modified bessel function of the first kind . for small @xmath60 ,",

    "the total wavevector @xmath78 for the @xmath61 band scales as @xmath79 i.e. , on a plane is it divergent .",
    "therefore , @xmath80 is a lower bound for the actual excitations at a given @xmath81 that will have large but finite @xmath2 .",
    "regardless of divergence of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eqdivk ] ) , the ( nearly ) linear behavior of @xmath82 suggests decoupling of sw s in the @xmath61 band and invokes a more general question of interaction between sw s in the lowest ( or higher ) ll s . unlike their number @xmath52",
    ", the individual angular momenta of interacting sw s are not conserved .",
    "for example , a pair of sw s both with @xmath54 and with the total angular momentum @xmath83 are coupled to a pair with the same @xmath51 but with different @xmath54 and 2 ; these two configurations being denoted as @xmath84 and @xmath85 . however ,",

    "this perturbation effect mixes the sw states within the energy range @xmath148 , so it becomes negligible when @xmath116 is small , i.e. , at small @xmath2 . in particular , it does not affect the behavior of @xmath149 at small @xmath2 , responsible for the linearity of the @xmath61 band .",
    "second , strictly speaking , the sw s are not bosons but pairs of fermions , and a wavefunction of two sw s must not only be symmetric under interchange of the entire sw s , but also antisymmetric under interchange of two constituent electrons or holes .",
    "the trial paired states @xmath120 with @xmath150 do not obey these symmetry requirements , because @xmath124 is isospin - asymmetric and hence it does not commute with pair @xmath11 or @xmath12 isospins , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , the trial eigenstates of @xmath150 are different from the properly symmetrized eigenstates of @xmath153 .",
    "this statistics effect is generally weak for spatially separated composite particles , but for the sw s moving along the same line ( or great circle ) it is large and can not be treated perturbatively ( even at small @xmath2 when the coulomb sw ",

    "the exact form of the ground state in the @xmath154 subspace depends on @xmath93 and on the details of the actual ( coulomb ) hamiltonian , and so does the average value of @xmath124 ( measuring the actual `` degree of pairing '' ) .",

    "the main two findings about the effective sw ",
    "sw pseudopotentials shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) are the following .",
    "first , the statistics effect turns out so strong as to reverse the sign of interaction .",
    "in contrast to the prediction of the model of independent sw s with dipole  dipole interaction , the sw s moving in the same direction decrease their total energy ( what can be interpreted as attraction ) , while the sw s moving in opposite direction increase their energy ( i.e. , repel one another ) .",
    "second , the magnitude of the @xmath23 attraction at small @xmath2 is greatly reduced compared to eq .",
    "( [ eqpwr1 ] ) .",
    "it can also be approximated by a power - law dispersion , but with a much higher exponent and a much smaller prefactor , @xmath177 although the near vanishing of @xmath178 at small @xmath2 was anticipated from the linearity of the @xmath61 band in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the negative sign and large exponent are rather surprising and of a wider consequence .",
    "it may be worth stressing that the identified attraction between @xmath26 sw s ( or interband excitons ) moving in the same direction is too weak to induce a stable bound ground state , with the total energy lower than @xmath26 times ground state energy of a single sw / exciton .",
    "therefore , it does not contradict a well - known fact that the ground state of @xmath26 electrons and @xmath26 holes in the lowest ll is a multiplicative state@xcite of @xmath26 sws / excitons each with @xmath10 ( in particular , a biexciton is unstable toward breaking up into two @xmath10 excitons , while the energy of @xmath26 sw s is never lower than @xmath179 , and so the @xmath13 ground state is spontaneously polarized ) . however , for two or more sws / excitons carrying a conserved total wavevector @xmath180 , the convex shape of @xmath181 causes equal distribution of @xmath182 among all sws / excitons , and the sw  sw or @xmath9@xmath9 attraction binds them together .",
    "such a moving multi - sw / exciton can only break up ( into separate sws / excitons ) through an inelastic collision taking away its wavevector .",
    "this dynamical binding will affect spin relaxation ( for the sw s ) or photoluminescence ( for the excitons ) of an electron gas , but the relevant spectra are yet to be calculated .",
    "we have studied interaction between moving sw s ( excitons ) in the lowest ll . for a pair of sw s with equal wavevectors @xmath2 and moving in the same ( @xmath23 ) or opposite ( @xmath24 ) directions , the effective interaction pseudopotentials @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 have been calculated numerically .",
    "they account for relaxation of overlapping sw s due to the fermi statistics of constituent ( reversed - spin ) electrons and ( spin- ) holes , and differ completely from the prediction for independent sw s interacting through their dipole moments .",
    "in particular , the signs of the interactions are reversed and their magnitudes are strongly decreased .",
