    "the small scale anisotropy in the observed arrival distribution of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is key in identifying their sources which will tell us a great deal about acceleration mechanisms , composition of uhecrs , and so on .",
    "the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) observation reveals the existence of the small scale clusterings in the isotropic arrival distribution of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "the current agasa data set of 57 events above 4 @xmath6 ev contains four doublets and one triplet within a separation angle of 2.5@xmath7 .",
    "chance probability to observe such clusters under an isotropic distribution is only about 1 @xmath8 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the recent claim by the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) experiment is that there is no small scale anisotropy in the uhecr arrival distribution above @xmath0 ev ( 162 events ) which is observed by a stereo air fluorescence detector @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the agasa and hires involves a number of consideration . among them",
    "are the different numbers of the events , the possibility of the measured energies being shifted between the two experiments , @xcite and the different angular resolutions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the first possibility .",
    "that is , we consider whether the discrepancy between the two experiments is statistically significant or not at present .",
    "there is furthermore the contradiction on the presence or absence of the gzk cutoff @xcite in the cosmic - ray energy spectrum due to photopion production with the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the hires spectrum shows the gzk cutoff @xcite , but the agasa spectrum does not @xcite . the statistical significance of this discrepancy",
    "is already discussed in @xcite and shown to be low at present .",
    "this issue is left for future investigation by new large - aperture detectors under development , such as south and north auger project @xcite , the euso @xcite , and the owl @xcite experiments .",
    "when we consider the statistical significance of the small scale anisotropy , we need to compare the observations with numerical calculations predicted by some kind of source distributions . in this paper , we use the optical redshift survey ( ors ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) galaxy sample to construct realistic source models of uhecrs .",
    "this sample has been adopted in our previous studies @xcite .",
    "it has been realized that the small scale anisotropy well reflect the number density of uhecr sources @xcite . and",
    "also , it is shown that the small scale anisotropy above @xmath9 ev observed by the agasa can be explained with the source number density @xmath10 assuming weak extragalactic magnetic field ( @xmath11 ng , egmf ) and that observed uhe particles are protons @xcite .",
    "we thus take the source number density as a parameter of our source model , and discuss the statistical significance of the small scale anisotropy by considering to what extent we can determine the source number density from the comparison of our model predictions with the hires observation .",
    "as mentioned above , the claim by the hires experiment on the small scale anisotropy is based on the data of uhecr arrival directions above @xmath1 ev .",
    "uhe protons at such energies are significantly deflected by the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) by a few @xmath12 degrees . in order to accurately calculate the expected uhecr arrival distribution and compare with the observations , this effect should be taken into account .    in our recent work @xcite",
    ", we presented a new method for calculating uhecr arrival distribution which can be applied to several source location scenarios including modifications by the gmf .",
    "brief explanation of our method is as follows .",
    "we numerically calculate the propagation of anti - protons from the earth toward the outside of the galaxy ( we set a sphere centered around the galactic center with radius @xmath1340 kpc as the boundary condition ) , considering the deflections due to the gmf .",
    "the anti - protons are ejected isotropically from the earth . by this calculation , we can obtain the trajectories and the sky map of position of anti - protons that have reached to the boundary at radius @xmath13 40 kpc .",
    "next , we regard the obtained trajectories as the ones of protons from the outside of the galaxy toward the earth . also , we regard the obtained sky map of position of anti - proton at the boundary as relative probability distribution ( per steradian ) for protons to be able to reach to the earth for the case in which the flux of the uhe protons from the extra - galactic region is isotropic ( in this study , this flux corresponds to the one at the boundary @xmath14 kpc ) .",
    "the validity of this treatment is supported by the liouville s theorem .",
    "when the flux of the uhe protons at the boundary is anisotropic ( e.g. , the source distribution is not isotropic ) , this effect can be included by multiplying this effect ( that is , by multiplying the probability density of arrival direction of uhe protons from the extra - galactic region at the boundary ) to the obtained relative probability density distribution mentioned above .    by adopting this new method , we can consider only the trajectories of protons which arrive to the earth , which , of course , helps us to save the cpu time efficiently and makes calculation of propagation of crs even with low energies ( @xmath2 ev ) possible within a reasonable time .    with this method",
    ", we calculate the arrival distribution of uhe protons above @xmath1 ev for our source models .",
    "we also consider the energy loss processes when uhe protons propagate in the intergalactic space .",
    "using the two point correlation function as statistical quantities for the small scale anisotropy , we compare our model prediction with the hires observation .",
    "we then discuss to what extent we can determine the source number density of uhecrs by the current hires data .",
    "we also briefly discuss future prospect of determining the source number density with the event number expected by future experiments .    in section  [ gmf ] ,",
    "we introduce the gmf model .",
    "we explain the method for calculating uhecr arrival distribution in section  [ method ] .",
    "results are shown in section  [ result ] . in section  [ summary ] , we summarize the main results .",
    "in this study , we adopt the gmf model used in @xcite , which is composed of the spiral and the dipole field . in the following",
    ", we briefly introduce this gmf model .",
    "faraday rotation measurements indicate that the gmf in the disk of the galaxy has a spiral structure with field reversals at the optical galactic arms @xcite .",
    "we use a bisymmetric spiral field ( bss ) model , which is favored from recent work @xcite .",
    "the solar system is located at a distance @xmath15 kpc from the center of the galaxy in the galactic plane . the local regular magnetic field in the vicinity of the solar system",
    "is assumed to be @xmath16 in the direction @xmath17 where the pitch angle is @xmath18 @xcite .    in the polar",
    "coordinates @xmath19 , the strength of the spiral field in the galactic plane is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 g , @xmath22 kpc and @xmath23 .",
    "the field decreases with galactocentric distance as @xmath24 and it is zero for @xmath25 kpc . in the region around the galactic center ( @xmath26 kpc ) the field is highly uncertain , and thus assumed to be constant and equal to its value at @xmath27 kpc .    the spiral field strengths above and below the galactic plane are taken to decrease exponentially with two scale heights @xcite @xmath28 where the factor @xmath29 makes the field continuous in @xmath30 .",
    "the bss spiral field we use is of even parity , that is , the field direction is preserved at disk crossing .",
    "observations show that the field in the galactic halo is much weaker than that in the disk . in this work",
    "we assume that the regular field corresponds to a a0 dipole field as suggested in @xcite .",
    "in spherical coordinates @xmath31 the @xmath32 components of the halo field are given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the magnetic moment of the galactic dipole .",
    "the dipole field is very strong in the central region of the galaxy , but is only 0.3 @xmath35 g in the vicinity of the solar system , directed toward the north galactic pole",
    ".    there may be a significant turbulent component , @xmath36 , of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "its field strength is difficult to measure and results found in literature are in the range of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "however , we neglect the random field throughout the paper for simplicity . possible dependence of the results on the assumption is discussed in the final section .",
    "the energy spectrum of uhecrs injected at extragalactic sources is modified by the energy loss processes when they propagate in the intergalactic space . in this subsection",
    ", we explain the method of monte carlo simulations for propagation of uhe protons in intergalactic space .",
    "we assume that the composition of uhecrs are protons which are injected with a power law spectrum within the range of ( @xmath1 - @xmath38)ev .",
    "we inject 10000 protons in each of 31 energy bins ( 10 bins per decade of energy ) . then , uhe protons are propagated including the energy loss processes ( explained below ) over @xmath39 gpc for @xmath40 gyr .",
    "we take a power law index as 2.6 to fit the predicted energy spectrum to the one observed by the hires @xcite .",
    "uhe protons below @xmath41 ev lose their energies mainly by pair creations and adiabatic energy losses , and above it by photopion production @xcite in collisions with photons of the cmb .",
    "we treat the adiabatic loss as a continuous loss process .",
    "we calculate the redshift @xmath30 of source at a given distance using the cosmological parameters @xmath42 km s@xmath43 mpc@xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , the pair production can be treated as a continuous loss process considering its small inelasticity ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we adopt the analytical fit functions given by @xcite to calculate the energy loss rate for the pair production on isotropic photons .    on the other hand , protons lose a large fraction of their energy in the photopion production . for this reason ,",
    "its treatment is very important .",
    "we use the interaction length and the energy distribution of final protons as a function of initial proton energy which is calculated by simulating the photopion production with the event generator sophia @xcite .",
    "the same approach has been adopted in our previous studies @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we neglect the effect of the egmf because of the following two reasons .",
    "first , numerical simulations of uhecr propagation in the egmf including lower energy ( @xmath2 ev ) ones take a long cpu time .",
    "secondly , we show in our previous study that small scale clustering observed by the agasa can be well reproduced in the case of weak egmf @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss whether the claim by the hires experiment is contrary to the agasa result with statistical significance .",
    "we should calculate the arrival distribution of uhecrs in the situation that the agasa experiment can be explained .",
    "of course , effects of strong egmf ( say , @xmath48 ng ) on uhecr propagation are intensively investigated @xcite , and can be hardly excluded considering the limited amount of observational data on the egmf .",
    "however , we assume extremely weak egmf throughout the paper .      in this study ,",
    "we apply the method for calculating the uhecr arrival distribution with modifications by the gmf ( section  [ calc_arrival ] ) to our source location scenario , which is constructed by using the ors @xcite galaxy catalog .    in order to calculate the distribution of arrival directions of uhecrs realistically ,",
    "there are two key elements of the galaxy sample to be corrected .",
    "first , galaxies in a given magnitude - limited sample are biased tracers of matter distribution because of the flux limit @xcite .",
    "although the sample of galaxies more luminous than @xmath49 mag is complete within 80 @xmath50 mpc ( where @xmath51 is the hubble constant divided by 100 km s@xmath43 and we use @xmath52 ) , it does not contain galaxies outside it for the reason of the selection effect .",
    "we distribute sources of uhecrs outside 80 @xmath50 mpc homogeneously .",
    "their number density is set to be equal to that inside 80 @xmath50 mpc .",
    "secondly , our ors sample does not include galaxies in the zone of avoidance ( @xmath53 ) . in the same way",
    ", we distribute uhecr sources in this region homogeneously , and calculate its number density from the number of galaxies in the observed region .",
    "as mentioned above , we take the number density of uhecr sources as our model parameter when we construct the source models . for a given number density , we randomly select galaxies from the above sample with probability proportional to the absolute luminosity of each galaxy . in this paper , the model parameters are taken to be @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "this subsection provides the method of calculation of uhecr arrival distribution with modifications by the gmf .",
    "the explanations largely follows our recent paper @xcite .",
    "we start by injecting anti - protons from the earth isotropically , and follow each trajectory until    \\1 .",
    "anti - proton reaches a sphere of radius @xmath58 kpc centered at the galactic center , or    \\2 . the total path length traveled by",
    "anti - proton is larger than @xmath59 kpc ,    by integrating the equations of motion in the magnetic field .",
    "it is noted that we regard these anti - protons as protons injected from the outside of the galaxy toward the earth .",
    "the number of propagated anti - proton is 2,000,000 .",
    "we have checked that the number of trajectories which are stopped by the limit ( 2 ) is smaller than @xmath60% of the total number .",
    "the energy loss of protons can be neglected for these distances .",
    "accordingly , we inject anti - protons with injection spectrum similar to the observed one @xmath61 .",
    "( note that this is not the energy spectrum injected at extragalactic sources . )",
    "the result of the velocity directions of anti - protons at the sphere of radius @xmath58 kpc is shown in the right panel of figure  [ event ] in the galactic coordinate . from liouville",
    "s theorem , if the cosmic - ray flux outside the galaxy is isotropic , one expects an isotropic flux at the earth even in the presence of the gmf .",
    "this theorem is confirmed by numerical calculations shown in figure 6 of @xcite , which is the same figure as our figure  [ event ] except for threshold energy .",
    "thus , the mapping of the velocity directions in the right panel of figure  [ event ] corresponds to the sources which actually give rise to the flux at the earth in the case that the sources ( including ones which do not actually give rise to the flux at the earth ) are distributed uniformly .",
    "we calculate the uhecr arrival distribution for our source scenario using the numerical data of the propagation of uhe anti - protons in the galaxy .",
    "detailed method is as follows . at first",
    ", we divide the sky into a number of bins with the same solid angle .",
    "the number of bins is taken to be @xmath62 .",
    "we then distribute all the trajectories into each bin according to their directions of velocities ( source directions ) at the sphere of radius @xmath58 kpc .",
    "finally , we randomly select trajectories from each bin with probability @xmath63 defined as @xmath64 here subscripts j and k distinguish each cell of the sky , @xmath65 is distance of each galaxy within the cell of ( j , k ) , and the summation runs over all of the galaxies within it .",
    "@xmath66 is the energy of proton , and @xmath67 is the energy spectrum of protons at our galaxy injected at a source of distance @xmath65 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath63 is determined so as to set the total number of events equal to a given number , for example , the event number of the current hires data . when @xmath68 , we newly generate events with number of @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the number of trajectories within the sky cell of @xmath71 .",
    "the arrival angle of newly generated proton ( equivalently , injection angle of anti - proton ) at the earth is calculated by adding a normally distributed deviate with zero mean and variance equal to the experimental resolution @xmath72 @xmath73 for @xmath0 ev @xmath74 to the original arrival angle .      a standard tool for searching the small scale anisotropy is the two point correlation function .",
    "this subsection provides the explanation of this function .",
    "we start from a set of simulated events . for each event , we divide the sphere into concentric bins of angular size @xmath75 , and count the number of events falling into each bin .",
    "we then divide it by the solid angle of the corresponding bin , that is , @xmath76 , \\label{eqn100}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 denotes the separation angle of the two events .",
    "@xmath75 is taken to be @xmath78 in this analysis .",
    "we also evaluate @xmath79 for an equal number of events simulated in a monte carlo for uniform source distribution .",
    "the estimator for the correlation function is then defined as @xmath80 .",
    "the two point correlation function of the hires data with 164 events above @xmath1 ev do not show significant small scale anisotropy , and is consistent with isotropic source distribution within @xmath81 confidence level .",
    "we thus compare the two point correlation functions predicted by our source models with that expected for isotropic source distribution rather than the hires data itself .",
    "when we consider to what extent we can determine the source number density of uhecrs , we have to quantify deviations of predictions by our source models from isotropic sources . to do so",
    ", we define the variable @xmath82 as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the angle at i - th bin . @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the statistical fluctuations of @xmath87 and @xmath88 at the angle @xmath84 . the summation is taken over the angular bins , whose number is denoted by @xmath89 .",
    "even if we specify the source number density , source distribution itself can not be determined because of randomness when we select galaxies from the ors sample .",
    "therefore , we first evaluate @xmath82 for a source distribution in the case of a given number density of uhecr sources .",
    "we then repeat such calculations for a number of realizations of the source selection , and obtain the probability distribution of @xmath82 for a source number density .",
    "the source selections are performed 100 times for all the source number densities .",
    "in this subsection , we present the results of arrival distribution of uhecrs above @xmath1 ev obtained by using the method explained in section [ calc_arrival ] .",
    "figure [ image_s3 ] and [ image_s5 ] show realizations of the event generations in the case of the source number density @xmath54 and @xmath56 mpc@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the events are shown by color according to their energies .",
    "note that the event number of hires data is 162 ( @xmath0 ev ) .",
    "this roughly corresponds to 300 events of figure [ image_s3 ] and [ image_s5 ] , considering the difference of the range @xmath90 ( declination ) between the observation and numerical calculation .",
    "as is evident from figure [ image_s3 ] and [ image_s5 ] , arrival distributions of uhecrs are quite isotropic .",
    "the harmonic analysis to the right ascension distribution of events is the conventional method to search for global anisotropy of cosmic ray arrival distribution . using this analysis",
    ", we have checked that large scale isotropy predicted by our source models is consistent with isotropic source distribution within a 90@xmath8 confidence level with event number equal to the current hires and agasa observations . on the other hand",
    ", arrival distributions observed by the hires and agasa do not also show any significant global anisotropy .",
    "there is no discrepancy between the two experiments .",
    "thus we do not discuss large scale isotropy in the following .    comparing figure [ image_s3 ] and [ image_s5 ]",
    ", we easily find that arrival distribution expected for smaller source number density exhibits stronger anisotropy on small angle scale .",
    "this is simply because contributions from each source to the total events are larger for smaller source number density .",
    "furthermore , the clustered events are aligned in the sky according to the order of their energies , reflecting the direction of the gmf at each direction .",
    "this interesting feature becomes evident with increasing amount of the event number .",
    "next , we discuss the statistics on arrival distribution of uhecrs .",
    "figure [ 2p_s3 ] and [ 2p_s5 ] show the two point correlation function expected in the case of source distributions of figure [ image_s3 ] and [ image_s5 ] , respectively .",
    "we calculate the two point correlation function for the simulated events within only @xmath91 in accordance with the hires exposure . for this reason ,",
    "the event numbers written in figure [ 2p_s3 ] and [ 2p_s5 ] differ from the ones in figure [ image_s3 ] and [ image_s5 ] .",
    "the error bars represent 1 @xmath92 statistical fluctuations of our numerical calculations due to the finite number of events .",
    "the shaded regions represent 1 @xmath92 fluctuations for uniform source distribution .",
    "the event selections are performed @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 times for the event number @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "it is noted that we compare our numerical results with not the hires data itself but the prediction of uniform source distribution .",
    "we do not have to consider the non - uniform observation in the angular sky .    as mentioned before ,",
    "it is evident that smaller source number density predicts stronger correlation between events at small angle scale .",
    "the small scale anisotropy well reflects the number density of uhecr sources .",
    "it is already shown that the small scale anisotropy above @xmath9 ev observed by the agasa can be explained with the source number density @xmath10 mpc @xmath4 assuming weak extragalactic magnetic field ( @xmath11 ng , egmf ) @xcite .",
    "we thus discuss the statistical significance of the discrepancy between the hires and agasa by considering to what extent we can determine the uhecr source number density from the current hires data .",
    "even if we specify the source number density , source distribution itself can not be determined because of randomness when we select galaxies from the ors sample .",
    "therefore , we first evaluate the statistical significance of deviation of the two point correlation function predicted by a source distribution for a given number density from that expected for uniform source distribution .",
    "we then repeat such calculations for a number of realizations of the source selection , and obtain the probability distribution of @xmath82 for a given source number density .",
    "the results of the probability distribution of @xmath82 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 are shown as histograms in figure [ histo ] and [ histo5 ] , respectively .",
    "the source selection is performed 100 times for all the source number densities . as we can see from the figures , differences between probability distributions of @xmath82 for different source number densities are clearer when @xmath101 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the two point correlation function is most sensitive to the source number density at the smallest angular bin ( see , figure [ 2p_s3 ] and [ 2p_s5 ] ) .",
    "we thus focus our attention to the result for @xmath101 in the following .",
    "as mentioned , we know that the small scale anisotropy observed by the agasa can be explained with the number density @xmath102 mpc@xmath4 . from figure [ histo ] , it is found that the small scale anisotropy predicted by this source number density is also consistent with the prediction of isotropic source distribution when the event number is equal to the hires data ( @xmath103 ) . it is noted that the agasa data have about 1000 events above @xmath1 ev .",
    "the possibility that the number density is about @xmath102 mpc@xmath4 can not be ruled out , although the hires result seems to be in agreement with the isotropic source distribution .",
    "we thus conclude that the statement by the hires experiment that they do not find small scale anisotropy in uhecr arrival distribution is not statistically significant at present .",
    "we now turn to the future prospects of determining the uhecr source number density .",
    "the probability distributions of @xmath82 with larger event number than the current observations are also shown in figure [ histo ] .",
    "of course , there is no observational data to be compared .",
    "we thus compare the model predictions with the case of isotropic source distribution .",
    "the results should be interpreted as quantifying deviations of our calculations from the prediction of isotropic sources in the unit of statistical fluctuations .    as is evident from figure [ histo ] , difference between the probability distribution of @xmath82 for different source number densities",
    "become clear when the number of data increases .",
    "we will be able to determine the source number density by the future observations of the small scale anisotropy . in order to discuss to what accuracy we can know the source number density ,",
    "we need to calculate the probability distribution of @xmath82 more precisely with a large number of simulations of the source selection .",
    "this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we will study it in a future publication .",
    "in this paper , we considered the statistical significance of the discrepancy between the hires and the agasa experiment on the small scale anisotropy in arrival distribution of uhecrs .",
    "we calculated arrival distribution of uhecrs above @xmath1 ev predicted by our source models constructed using the ors galaxy sample .",
    "we applied the new method developed by us @xcite for calculating arrival distribution with the modifications by the gmf .",
    "the great advantage of this method is that it enables us to calculate uhecr arrival distribution with lower energy ( @xmath2 ev ) than previous studies by following only the trajectories actually reaching the earth .",

    "what accuracy we can know the source number density , we need to calculate the probability distribution of @xmath82 more precisely with a large number of simulations of the source selection .",
    "this issue deserves further investigation .    finally , we mention the assumptions made in this paper .",
    "we neglected the effects of the extragalactic magnetic field and the random component of the gmf .",

    "<S> we apply the new method developed by us for calculating arrival distribution in the presence of the galactic magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the great advantage of this method is that it enables us to calculate uhecr arrival distribution with lower energy ( @xmath2 ev ) than previous studies within reasonable time by following only the trajectories of uhecrs actually reaching the earth . </S>",
    "<S> it has been realized that the small scale anisotropy observed by the agasa can be explained with the source number density @xmath3 mpc@xmath4 assuming weak extragalactic magnetic field ( @xmath5 ng ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted small scale anisotropy for this source number density is also consistent with the current hires data . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that the statement by the hires experiment that they do not find small scale anisotropy in uhecr arrival distribution is not statistically significant at present . </S>",
    "<S> we also show future prospect of determining the source number density with increasing amount of observed data . </S>"
