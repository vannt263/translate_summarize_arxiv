    "relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models based on effective lagrangians with non - linear terms in the meson sector@xcite , have been successfully applied in the description of static properties of nuclei . with only six or seven phenomenological parameters ( coupling constants and masses ) ,",
    "carefully adjusted to a small set of experimental data in spherical nuclei , excellent results are obtained for binding energies and radii , density distributions , deformation parameters and moments of inertia over the entire periodic table@xcite .",
    "there are , of course , cases where the mean field description breaks down , and certainly there will be further refinements of the parameter sets in the future , but in general the relativistic mean field framework provides us with an unexpectedly simple and successful tool to describe static properties of the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "the description of excited states within the same framework has been much less studied .",
    "very successful applications of the cranking relativistic mean field model in the description of collective rotational bands have been reported @xcite , and an excellent description of excitation energies of multipole giant resonances has been obtained with the time - dependent relativistic mean field ( tdrmf ) model@xcite .",
    "the cranking rmf model is , however , quasi - static , and in some cases the large computational effort prevents an accurate description of excited states in the time - dependent framework .",
    "in addition , with the exception of the monopole case , time - dependent calculations violate rotational symmetry , and therefore it is not always easy to separate modes with different angular momenta .    in the non - relativistic mean field framework",
    "the standard tool for the description of excited states is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite . on the other hand , applications of the relativistic rpa ( rrpa )",
    "have only very recently reached quantitative agreement with experimental data , and so far only in a few very specific cases @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "first , although rrpa computer codes have been developed already in the eighties @xcite , those were based on the linear version of the relativistic mean field model , sometimes also called the walecka model . with only linear terms in the meson sector , the rmf model does not reproduce ground state properties of finite nuclei on a quantitative level , and therefore also the corresponding rrpa calculations of excited states are not in agreement with experiments .",
    "second , only recently it has been shown that the fully consistent inclusion of the dirac sea of negative energy states in the rrpa is essential for a quantitative comparison with experimental excitation energies of isoscalar giant resonances @xcite .",
    "it has to be emphasized that already in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the inclusion of configurations built from occupied positive - energy states and empty negative - energy states is essential for current conservation and the decoupling of the spurious state . what was not known until very recently , however , is that the inclusion of states with unperturbed energies more than 1.2 gev below the fermi energy has a pronounced effect on giant resonances with excitation energies in the mev region .    in the last decade",
    "new techniques have been developed which enable the inclusion of non - linear meson interactions in the rrpa @xcite . with the use of non - linear lagrangians",
    "it became evident that the @xmath0-configurations ( @xmath1 empty state in the dirac sea , @xmath2 occupied state in the fermi sea ) strongly affect the excitation energies of the isoscalar giant resonances .",
    "the @xmath0-configurations have recently been included in the calculation of the relativistic linear response @xcite , and in the diagonalization of the rrpa - matrix @xcite . the pronounced effect of the dirac sea in the rrpa calculation of giant resonances was completely unexpected , because it occurs in particular for states ( @xmath3 or 2@xmath4 ) which are orthogonal to the spurious mode ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is caused by the fact that , due to the relativistic structure of the rpa equations , the matrix elements of the time - like component of the vector meson fields which couple the @xmath0-configurations with the @xmath6-configurations , are strongly reduced with respect to the corresponding matrix elements of the isoscalar scalar meson field . as a result , the well known cancellation between the contributions of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 fields , which , for instance , occurs for the ground - state solution , does not take place and large matrix elements which couple the @xmath0-sector with the @xmath6-configurations are present in the rrpa matrix .",
    "in addition , the number of @xmath0-configurations which can couple to the @xmath6-configurations in the neighborhood of the fermi surface is much larger than the number of @xmath6-configurations .",
    "because of level repulsion ( wigner s no - crossing rule ) the effect is always repulsive , i.e. the inclusion of the @xmath0-configurations pushes the resonances to higher excitation energies .",
    "the non - linear meson terms in the effective lagrangian , and the configurations built from negative energy dirac sea states , were included in the time - dependent calculations of refs .",
    "a rigorous derivation of the rrpa - equations in the small amplitude limit of tdrmf @xcite , shows that the time - dependent variation of the density matrix @xmath9 contains not only the usual @xmath6-components with a particle state @xmath10 above the fermi sea and a hole state @xmath2 in the fermi sea , but also components with a particle @xmath1 in the dirac sea and a hole @xmath11 in the fermi sea .",
    "although for the stationary solutions the negative - energy states do not contribute to the densities in the _ no - sea _ approximation , their contribution is implicitly included in the time - dependent calculation , even if the time - dependent densities and currents are calculated in the _ no - sea _ approximation .",
    "the coupled system of rmf equations describes the time - evolution of a nucleons in the effective mean - field potential .",
    "only particles in the fermi sea are explicitly propagated in time , and the corresponding vacuum is , of course , time - dependent .",
    "this means that at each time there is a _ local _ fermi sea of @xmath12 time - dependent spinors which , of course , contain components of negative - energy solutions of the stationary dirac equation .",
    "one could also start with the infinitely many negative energy solutions and propagate them in time with the same dirac hamiltonian .",
    "since the time - evolution operator is unitary , the states which form the _ local _ dirac sea are orthogonal to the _ local _ fermi sea at each time .",
    "this is the meaning of the _ no - sea _ approximation in the time - dependent problem .    both effects , the non - linear meson terms in the effective lagrangian , and the inclusion of dirac sea states in the rrpa ,",
    "are now well understood . in this work",
    "we present a systematic study of different excitation modes in the fully consistent rrpa framework . by using effective lagrangians",
    "which , in the mean - field approximation , provide an accurate description of ground - state properties , we will show that an excellent agreement with experimental data is also obtained for the excitation energies of low - lying collective states and of giant resonances .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the formalism of the fully consistent rrpa is presented in the section ii . in section iii",
    "we analyze in detail the lowest multipole isoscalar and isovector excitation modes , both at low energy and in the regions of giant resonances .",
    "the results are summarized in section iv .",
    "in the rrpa framework two methods are used to calculate the physical quantities relevant to nuclear excitations . either the linear response function of the nucleus is calculated directly , or the rrpa matrix equation is diagonalized . in both cases",
    "the starting point is the self - consistent solution for the ground state .",
    "the dirac equation and the equations for the meson fields are solved by expanding the nucleon spinors and the meson fields in terms of the eigenfunctions a spherical harmonic oscillator potential @xcite .",
    "the resulting single nucleon spinors are used to build the rrpa basis : a set of particle - hole ( @xmath6 ) and antiparticle - hole ( @xmath0 ) pairs .",
    "the number of basis states is determined by two cut - off factors : the maximal @xmath6-energy ( @xmath13 ) , the minimal @xmath0-energy ( @xmath14 ) , and by the angular momentum coupling rules . in this basis the unperturbed polarization operator @xmath15 , or the rpa matrix is built .",
    "both methods have been employed in the present analysis , and it has been verified that they produce identical results .    the linear response of a nucleus to an external one - body field is given by the imaginary part of the retarded polarization operator @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the external field 4@xmath184 matrix operator .",
    "the technical details of the calculation can be found , for instance , in ref.@xcite . from the linearized bethe - salpeter equation in momentum space ,",
    "the polarization operator is obtained @xmath19 where the summation is over the meson fields which mediate the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are 4@xmath184 matrices which determine the dirac structure of the corresponding operators and propagators . for the isoscalar scalar meson ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 , for the isoscalar vector meson ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26 for the time component , and @xmath27 for the spatial components .",
    "an additional isospin matrix @xmath28 has to be included for the isovector vector meson ( @xmath29 ) . in general ,",
    "the meson propagators are defined as solutions of @xmath30 where , for an effective lagrangian with meson self - interactions , @xmath31 is the generalized mass term . for the non - linear @xmath7 model @xcite @xmath32 effective lagrangians with @xmath8 self - interactions",
    "have also been considered@xcite : @xmath33 the propagators in momentum space are obtained by the fourier transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fourier transform of @xmath36 , @xmath37 without meson self - interaction terms the propagators are diagonal in momentum space , @xmath38 and the solution reads @xmath39 where the plus ( minus ) sign corresponds to vector ( scalar ) mesons . retardation effects ( the frequency dependence of the propagator ) are easily taken into account in the linear response formalism .",
    "this is not the case in the time - dependent formulation@xcite , or for the solution of the rpa equations by matrix diagonalization in configuration space@xcite .",
    "however , since the meson masses are very large as compared to excitation energies of nuclear collective modes , retardation effects can be neglected to a very good approximation .",
    "the unperturbed polarization is given by @xmath40 where the indices @xmath10 and @xmath2 run over all unoccupied and occupied ( fermi sea ) positive energy solutions of the dirac equation , respectively .",
    "the index @xmath1 denotes states in the dirac sea ( negative energy states ) .",

    "the spin matrices @xmath54 carry angular momentum 1 , and therefore @xmath55 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath52 vanish due to parity conservation .",
    "alternatively , the rrpa matrices are built in configuration space @xcite @xmath56 the two - body interaction @xmath57 has the form @xmath58 here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the dirac matrices acting in the space of particle @xmath61 , and for simplicity the contributions of the @xmath62-meson and the photon have been omitted .",
    "the eigenmodes of the system are determined by the rrpa equation @xmath63 the transition densities and transition amplitudes are expressed in terms of the rrpa amplitudes ( @xmath64)@xcite .",
    "the dimension of the rrpa matrix is twice the number of @xmath6- and @xmath0-pairs , and the matrix is obviously non - hermitian . in the non relativistic case",
    "the rpa matrix is real and the matrices @xmath65 are positive definite .",
    "the eigenvalue equation is then reduced to a hermitian problem of half dimension ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the relativistic rpa , on the other hand , the matrix @xmath12 has large negative diagonal elements @xmath66 mev , and the eigenvalue equation can no longer be reduced to a hermitian problem of half dimension .",
    "the full non - hermitian rrpa matrix has to be diagonalized , even in cases when the matrix elements are real .",
    "this , of course , presents a considerable increase in computation as compared to the non relativistic case .",
    "in the present analysis we have performed rrpa calculations with nonlinear effective lagrangians which , in the mean - field approximation , describe ground - state properties of finite nuclei all over the periodic table . within the non - relativistic framework ,",
    "the rpa with both the hartree - fock mean field and the residual particle - hole interaction derived from the same energy functional @xcite has been very successfully applied in calculations of low - lying collective states and giant resonances .",
    "some of the earliest application of the relativistic rpa have also used the residual particle - hole interaction derived from the the same effective lagrangian which generates the solution for the ground state .",
    "these calculations @xcite , however , were based on the most simple , linear @xmath67 - @xmath68 relativistic mean field model , and only a qualitative comparison with experimental data was possible .",
    "most results in the present analysis have been obtained with the nl3@xcite non - linear parameter set of the effective lagrangian .",
    "we have used this effective interaction in most of our recent applications of the relativistic mean - field model , and the results that have been obtained for the ground - state properties indicate that nl3 is probably the best effective force so far , both for nuclei at and away from the line of @xmath69-stability . in order to study how the results for excited states depend on different effective interactions ,",
    "we have also used other well known non - linear parameter sets : nl1@xcite , nl - sh@xcite and tm1@xcite , as well as the linear walecka model hs@xcite .",
    "the different parameter sets are listed in table 1 .",
    "the multipole strength distributions have been calculated either with the response function method or by diagonalizing the rrpa matrices . in the former case",
    "the strength function is given by eq.([eq1 ] ) in the limit of @xmath70 .",
    "the isoscalar and isovector multipole operators are defined @xmath71 an energy averaging is performed by replacing the infinitesimal quantity @xmath72 , with @xmath48=2 mev . in the matrix rrpa diagonalization method the resulting multipole transition probabilities between the ground and excited states @xmath73 are used to calculate the lorentzian - averaged strength distribution @xmath74 @xmath75 is the width of the lorentzian distribution .      as an example of low - lying vibrational states in",
    "spherical nuclei , in table 2 we display the rrpa energies and b(el ) values for the lowest collective states with angular momentum @xmath76 = 2@xmath4 , 3@xmath77 , 4@xmath4 , 5@xmath77 in @xmath78pb .",
    "the effective interaction is nl3 and the results have been obtained by diagonalizing the rrpa matrices in configuration space .",
    "the position of the low - lying collective states , as well as the b(el ) values , depend sensitively on the details of the single - particle spectrum around the fermi surface .",
    "the general agreement with experimental data is very good , both for the excitation energies and transition probabilities .",
    "similar results were obtained in the non - relativistic consistent rpa framework with skyrme interactions @xcite , and with the gogny interaction @xcite .",
    "the study of isoscalar giant monopole resonances ( isgmr ) in spherical nuclei is essential for obtaining information on the nuclear matter compression modulus @xmath79 . through the nuclear matter equation of state",
    ", this quantity defines basic properties of nuclei , supernovae explosions , neutron stars and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "both the time - dependent relativistic mean - field model @xcite and the relativistic rpa @xcite , have been recently applied in microscopic calculations of monopole excitation energies .",
    "the non - linear effective interactions have much lower nuclear matter compression moduli , as compare to older , linear parameter sets .",
    "it has been found that experimental gmr energies are best reproduced by an effective force with @xmath80 mev , i.e. , about 10% - 15% higher than the values found in non - relativistic hartree - fock plus random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations .",
    "the difference between the non - relativistic and relativistic predictions for the nuclear matter compression modulus is so far not understood , and it requires further investigations .",
    "there are less experimental data on the isovector giant monopole resonances ( ivgmr ) .",
    "because of the repulsive character of the particle - hole interaction in the isovector channel , ivgm resonances are found at higher excitation energies ( typically 25 - 30 mev in heavy nuclei ) .",
    "the widths of the ivgmr are also much larger ( typically around 10 mev ) than those of the isoscalar resonances . in fig.[fig1 ] we display the isovector monopole strength distribution in @xmath78pb , calculated with the nl3 effective interaction .",
    "the large width of the calculated resonance is caused by landau damping .",
    "similar features were also found in non - relativistic rpa calculations with skyrme interactions@xcite . in table 3",
    "we have compared the centroid energies of the ivgmr in @xmath78pb , calculated with different non - linear effective interactions , with experimental data .",
    "the agreement with experiment is very good , and only small differences are found between the predictions of the different parameter sets .",
    "this is , of course , expected since these effective interactions were adjusted to give similar values for the nuclear matter symmetry energy .      except for the monopole mode ,",
    "the response of a nucleus to higher multipoles is difficult to calculate in the time - dependent rmf .",
    "rotational invariance is broken and the differential equations have to be explicitly solved at each step in time on a two dimensional mesh in coordinate space .",
    "it is difficult to keep the solutions stable for very long times , which are necessary for high accuracy .",
    "it is much easier to perform rrpa calculations for higher multipole modes .",
    "the isoscalar dipole mode has been recently studied in the rrpa framework @xcite , and in the present work we analyze the well known isovector giant dipole resonance ( ivgdr ) .",
    "the effect of the dirac sea states on the isovector dipole strength distribution is illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the ivgdr response function in @xmath78pb has been calculated with the nl3 effective interaction .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are the rrpa strengths with and without the inclusion of @xmath0 configurations , respectively .",
    "the effect of not including negative energy states is very small : the height of the peak is slightly lowered , and some extra strength appears in the 5 - 7 mev region , but the energy distribution is practically unchanged .",
    "this is , of course , due to the fact that the @xmath0 configurations become really important only if the @xmath67-meson dominates the rrpa response @xcite . for the isovector modes the contribution of the isovector",
    "@xmath81 meson is the dominant component of the particle - hole interaction .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] , where the dashed - double dotted curve corresponds to the calculation with only the @xmath81 meson field in the residual particle - hole interaction .",
    "comparing the full rrpa response and the @xmath81-only calculation , it is seen that the only effect is that some strength from the main peak is pushed back to the @xmath82 mev region , when the isoscalar mesons are included .",
    "another information contained in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is that there is practically no contribution from the the spatial part @xmath83 of the @xmath81-induced interaction .",
    "the dash - dotted curve ( practically on the solid curve ) corresponds to the calculation in which this part of the @xmath81 exchange interaction has been omitted .",
    "the ivgdr strengths in @xmath78pb , calculated with four different effective interactions , are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "in all four panels a strong collective shift from the free hartree response to the full rrpa response is observed .",
    "this shift is predominantly caused be the isovector @xmath81 meson field in the particle - hole channel .",
    "the isoscalar mesons pull the strengths slightly back to lower energies .",
    "the experimental ivgdr energy in @xmath78pb is 13.5@xmath840.2 mev@xcite .",
    "all the calculated peak energies are very close to this value , and it is difficult to discriminate among the different interactions .",
    "although the ivgdr is mainly related to the coefficient of the symmetry energy , this relation is not very pronounced in the calculated peaks .",
    "for instance , the symmetry energy is 35 mev for hs , and 43.7 mev for nl1 , but the peak and centroid energies of the corresponding strength distributions are very similar .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "we display the transition densities for the ivgdr peak at 12.9 mev in @xmath78pb , calculated with the nl3 interaction .",
    "the proton and neutron contributions are plotted separately .",
    "the radial dependence is characteristic for the isovector giant dipole resonance : a node at the center , the proton and neutron densities oscillate with opposite phases in the surface region , they are in phase in the interior of the nucleus .    finally , in fig.[fig5 ] we show the ivgdr strength distributions for four different spherical nuclei , calculated with the nl3 interaction .",
    "the main peaks are generally found very close to the experimental centroid energies , and the landau width increases for lighter nuclei .      in a harmonic oscillator potential",
    "the microscopic structure of quadrupole excitations is simple : 2@xmath85 particle - hole configurations coupled by the residual interaction . in the isoscalar ( isovector ) channel the particle - hole interaction is attractive ( repulsive ) , and it generates a collective state which is found in the energy region below ( above ) 2@xmath85 .",
    "in addition to the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance ( isgqr ) and isovector giant quadrupole resonance ( ivgqr ) , part of the isoscalar strength can be found in the 0@xmath85 low - lying discrete states ( seen subsection iii.a ) .",
    "the isgqr strength functions for four magic nuclei are shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the effective interaction is nl3 .",
    "the collective downward shift from the hartree response ( dotted curves ) to the rrpa response ( solid lines ) , is clearly observed .",
    "the figures also illustrate the effect of the @xmath0-configurations ( @xmath1 empty state in the dirac sea , @xmath2 occupied state in the fermi sea ) on the rrpa response .",
    "as we have already explained , a rather large effect can be expected for isoscalar modes .",
    "indeed , apart from @xmath86o , the positions of the main peaks are shifted to higher energy by 1 - 2 mev by the inclusion of @xmath0-configurations .",
    "the effect , however , is not as large as in the monopole case .",
    "it also seems that the low - lying 2@xmath4 discrete states are less sensitive to the inclusion of @xmath0 configurations in the rrpa .",
    "the corresponding transition densities clearly exhibit the isoscalar nature of these excitations . in fig.[fig7 ] we display the transition densities for the low - lying 2@xmath4 state , and for the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance in @xmath78pb : the neutron and proton densities oscillate in phase , the transition density of the discrete state is localized on the surface , while a large component in the interior region is observed for the transition density of the giant resonance .",
    "the isovector giant quadrupole resonance is less collective , because the repulsive isovector interaction mediated by the @xmath81 meson is weaker than the attractive isoscalar interaction ( @xmath87 and @xmath8 meson fields ) .",
    "this leads to large landau fragmentation of the strength distribution , similar to that observed in the ivgmr case . in fig.[fig8 ] we display the ivgqr strength in @xmath78pb calculated with the nl3 parameter set of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the distribution has a peak at 23 mev , very close to the position of the experimental centroid energy at 22 mev @xcite .",
    "the transition densities of the state which corresponds to the peak energy are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . as in the dipole case ,",
    "the isovector nature of this mode is clearly observed in the surface region .",
    "one of the best studied resonances is certainly the isoscalar giant octupole resonance ( isgor ) in heavy nuclei . in @xmath78pb for instance , in addition to the low - lying 3@xmath77 state ( cf .",
    "subsection iii.a ) , the octupole strength distribution displays a pronounced fragmentation in two energy regions : the low - energy octupole resonance ( leor ) and the high - energy octupole resonance ( heor)@xcite . the strength in the lower energy region corresponds mainly to 1@xmath85 excitations , while 3@xmath88 configurations dominate in the high - energy octupole resonance .",
    "the isgor strength distributions in @xmath78pb are displayed in fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "the effective interaction is nl3 .",
    "in addition to the low - lying discrete state ( represented as a vertical bar in arbitrary units ) , the leor strength is found between 6 and 10 mev , and the heor strength is concentrated around 23 mev .",
    "the rrpa results are similar to those obtained in non - relativistic hartree - fock - rpa calculations @xcite , and compare well with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the strength functions have been calculated with the response function method and , in addition to the full rrpa ( solid curve ) , the hartree response ( dotted curve ) is displayed , as well as the strength function calculated without the contribution of the @xmath0 configurations . also for the isoscalar octupole mode",
    "a strong effect of the negative energy states is observed .",
    "their contribution shifts the centroid of the heor to higher energy by few mev . without the inclusion of the @xmath0 configurations in the rrpa basis",
    ", the energy of the leor becomes even negative .",
    "this clearly shows the importance of working with a complete basis in the relativistic rpa framework .",
    "collective excitations in spherical nuclei have been investigated in the framework of a fully self - consistent relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) . by using effective lagrangians",
    "which , in the mean - field approximation , provide an accurate description of ground - state properties , the strength distribution functions have been calculated both with the linear response method and by diagonalization of the rrpa matrices in configuration spaces .",
    "results of rrpa calculations of multipole giant resonances and of low - lying collective states have been analyzed .",
    "for a set of spherical nuclei , the strength functions of normal parity multipole giant resonances : ivgmr , ivgdr , isgqr , ivgqr , and isgor , have been calculated with the non - linear effective interactions nl1 , nl3 , nl - sh , tm1 , and for comparison , also with the linear parameter set hs .",
    "the results have been compared with available experimental data .",
    "an excellent agreement has been found for the positions of the giant resonance peaks calculated with the non - linear effective interactions .",
    "the calculated low - lying collective states are also in very good agreement with experimental data , particularly if one takes into account the fact that the effective interactions have not been in any way adjusted to properties of excited states .",
    "the relativistic mean - field lagrangians with meson self - interaction terms provide not only an excellent description of ground state properties , but can be very successfully applied in the analysis of the dynamics of collective excitations within the rrpa framework .    it has been shown that an rrpa calculation , consistent with the mean - field model in the @xmath89 approximation , necessitates configuration spaces that include both particle - hole pairs and pairs formed from occupied states and negative - energy states .",
    "the contributions from configurations built from occupied positive - energy states and negative - energy states are essential for current conservation and the decoupling of the spurious state .",
    "in addition , configurations which include negative - energy states have an especially pronounced effect on isoscalar excitation modes . for the isoscalar states the rrpa matrix contains large elements which couple the @xmath0-sector with the @xmath6-configurations .",
    "this is due to the fact that the contribution of the time - like component of the vector meson fields to these matrix elements , is strongly reduced with respect to the corresponding contribution of the isoscalar scalar meson field .",
    "the well known cancellation between the contributions of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons , which for instance , takes place in the ground - state solution , does not occur in the rrpa matrix for the isoscalar states .",
    "the effect on the excitation energies of isoscalar modes can be up to few mev .",
    "the isovector excitation modes , on the other hand , are much less affected by the contribution of negative energy states in isospin zero nuclei .",
    "the effect is slightly more pronounced in isospin non - zero nuclei .",
    "isospin mixing in the isovector excitation modes has been observed in isospin non - zero nuclei , e.g. @xmath78pb , and probably such effects could be rather important in studies of nuclei with a large neutron excess .",

    "<S> results of rrpa calculations of multipole giant resonances and of low - lying collective states in spherical nuclei are analyzed . by using effective lagrangians </S>",
    "<S> which , in the mean - field approximation , provide an accurate description of ground - state properties , an excellent agreement with experimental data is also found for the excitation energies of low - lying collective states and of giant resonances . </S>",
    "<S> two points are essential for the successful application of the rrpa in the description of dynamical properties of finite nuclei : ( i ) the use of effective lagrangians with non - linear terms in the meson sector , and ( ii ) the fully consistent treatment of the dirac sea of negative energy states . </S>"
