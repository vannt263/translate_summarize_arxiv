    "the two @xmath3 meson factories babar and belle , which have already started operation , open an exciting new era in studying physics of @xmath3 mesons .",
    "both factories have already presented thrilling results on cp violation @xcite .",
    "the physics program of the b factories contain two main directions : detailed study of cp violation in @xmath4 decays and precise measurement of rare flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes .",
    "it is well known that fcnc processes are very sensitive to the new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "so , main goal of the investigations undergoing at @xmath3 factories is to find inconsistencies within the sm , in particular find indications for new physics in the flavor and cp violating sector @xcite .",
    "new physics effects can appear in rare @xmath3 meson decays in two different ways , either through new contributions to the wilson coefficients existing in the sm or through the new structures in the effective hamiltonian which are absent in the sm .",
    "rare @xmath3 meson decays induced by @xmath5 transition has been extensively studied in framework of the sm and its various extensions @xcite@xcite .",
    "one of the efficient ways in establishing new physics beyond the sm is the measurement of the lepton polarization @xcite@xcite .",
    "all previous studies for the lepton polarization have been limited to sm and its minimal extensions , except the works @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the analysis of the @xmath6 lepton polarization for the inclusive @xmath7 decay was presented in a model independent way and in @xcite lepton polarizations are investigated using the most general model independent hamiltonian for the @xmath8 decay .    the aim of this work is studying lepton polarizations in the exclusive @xmath9 decay using the general form of the effective hamiltonian including all possible form of interactions . here",
    "we will study @xmath10 and @xmath6 leptonic modes because of the following two reasons .",
    "firstly , the electron polarization is hard to measure experimentally , and secondly , it is well known that in the sm the normal @xmath11 and transversal @xmath12 polarizations are both proportional to the lepton mass and hence their measurements might be possible especially in the @xmath13 channel .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section 2 , using a general form of four  fermi interaction we derive the general expressions for the longitudinal , transversal and normal polarizations of leptons . in section 3",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of the above  mentioned polarizations to the new wilson coefficients . at the end of this section",
    "we also present our conclusion .",
    "in this section we compute the lepton polarization asymmetries , using the most general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath14 transition in terms of twelve model independent four  fermi interactions can be written in the following form : [ matel ] h_eff & = & v_tsv_tb^\\ { c_sl    & & + c_ll^tot |s_l _",

    "note that among twelve wilson coefficients several already exist in the sm .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the sm , respectively .",
    "the next four terms in eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) are the vector type interactions with coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "two of these vector interactions containing @xmath23 and @xmath24 do exist in the sm as well in the form @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "therefore we can say that @xmath23 and @xmath24 describe the sum of the contributions from sm and the new physics and they can be written as c_ll^tot & = & c_9^eff - c_10 + c_ll  , + c_lr^tot & = & c_9^eff + c_10 + c_lr  , the terms with coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 describe the scalar type interactions .",
    "the last two terms with the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 , obviously , describe the tensor type interactions .",
    "exclusive @xmath2 decay is described by the matrix element of effective hamiltonian over @xmath3 and @xmath35 meson states , which can be parametrized in terms of form factors .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) that in order to calculate the amplitude of the @xmath2 decay , the following matrix elements are needed [ roll ] & & k|s _ b b  , + & & k |s i _ q^b b  , + & & k |s b b  , + & & k |s _ b b  .",

    "b(p_b ) & = &  . taking into account eqs .",

    "the expression for the unpolarized differential decay rate in eq .",

    "( [ ptm ] ) we observe that at zero lepton mass limit , contributions coming from scalar interactions survive .",
    "similarly terms coming from scalar and tensor interactions survive in the massless lepton limit for @xmath67",
    ". therefore , experimentally measured value of @xmath68 for the @xmath69 can give a very promising hint in looking new physics beyond sm .",
    "about normal polarization we can comment as follows .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ pnm ] ) the difference between @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( for which sm predicts @xmath72 ) is again due to the existence of the scalar and tensor interactions .",
    "incidentally , w e should note that a similar situation takes place for the lepton polarizations in the @xmath8 decay @xcite .",
    "it follows from this discussion that a measurement of the lepton polarization of each lepton and combined analysis of lepton and antilepton polarizations @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 can give very useful information to constraint or to discover new physics beyond sm , which are all zero in the sm in the limit of massless leptons .",
    "therefore if in experiments nonzero value of the above mentioned combined lepton asymmetries were observed , this can be considered as an discovery of the new physics beyond sm .",
    "first of all we introduce the values of the input parameters used in the present work : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "it is well known that the wilson coefficient @xmath81 receives short as well as long distance contributions coming from the real @xmath82 intermediate states , i.e. , with the @xmath83 family , but in this work we consider only short distance contributions .",
    "experimental data on @xmath84 fixes only the modulo of @xmath85 . for this reason throughout our analysis we have considered both possibilities , i.e. , @xmath86 , where the upper sign corresponds to the sm prediction .    for the values of the form factors , we have used the results of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath87 dependence of the form factors can be represented in terms of three parameters as [ fit ] f(s ) = f(0 ) exp(c_1 s + c_2 s^2 + c_3 s^3 )  , where the values of parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the @xmath92 decay are listed in table 1 .",
    "@xmath93    from the expressions of the lepton polarizations we see that they all depend on @xmath87 and the new wilson coefficients",
    ". it may be experimentally difficult to study the dependence of the the polarizations of each lepton on both quantities .",
    "therefore we eliminate the dependence of the lepton polarizations on @xmath87 , by performing integration over @xmath87 in the allowed kinematical region , so that the lepton polarizations are averaged .",
    "the averaged lepton polarizations are defined as [ av ] p_i =  .",
    "we present our results in a series figures . note that in all figures we presented the value of @xmath85 is chosen to have its sm value , i.e. , @xmath94",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) depict the dependence of the averaged longitudinal polarization @xmath95 of @xmath0 and the combination @xmath96 on new wilson coefficients , at @xmath94 for @xmath69 decay . from these figures",
    "we see that @xmath95 is sensitive to the existence of all new interactions except to vector and scalar interactions with coefficients @xmath97 , @xmath25 and @xmath30 , @xmath29 , respectively , while the combined average @xmath96 is sensitive to scalar type interactions only .",
    "it is interesting that contributions from @xmath30 , @xmath29 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) to the combined asymmetry is always negative ( positive )",
    ". therefore determination of the sign of @xmath98 can be useful in discriminating the type of the interaction . from fig .",
    "( 2 ) we see that @xmath99 at @xmath100 , which confirms the sm result as expected . for the other choice of @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath101 the situation is similar to the previous case , but the magnitude of @xmath96 is smaller . figs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are the same as figs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) but for the @xmath102 decay . in this case",
    "the difference of the dependence of the longitudinal polarization @xmath95 on new wilson coefficients from the muon case is as follows : in the muon case @xmath103 is negative for all values of the new wilson coefficients while for the tau case @xmath95 can receive both values , for example for @xmath104 , @xmath95 is positive , and for @xmath105 , @xmath95 is negative .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "( 4 ) that if the values of the new wilson coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 and @xmath34 are negative ( positive ) , @xmath96 is negative ( positive ) .",
    "absolutely similar situation takes place for @xmath106 . for these reasons determination of the sign and of course magnitude of @xmath107 can give promising information about new physics .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) the dependence of the average transversal polarization @xmath108 and the combination @xmath109 on the new wilson coefficients are presented for the @xmath69 decay , respectively .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "( 5 ) that the average transversal polarization is strongly dependent only on @xmath31 and @xmath32 and quite weakly to remaining wilson coefficients .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for the negative ( positive ) values of these scalar coefficients @xmath108 is negative ( positive ) . for the @xmath109 case",
    ", there appears strong dependence on all four scalar interactions with coefficients @xmath110 .",
    "the behavior of this combined average transversal polarization is identical for the coefficients @xmath111 and @xmath112 in pairs , so that four lines responsible for these interactions appear only to be two .",
    "moreover @xmath109 is negative ( positive ) for the negative ( positive ) values of the new wilson coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 and positive ( negative ) for the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "remembering that in sm , in massless lepton case @xmath113 and @xmath114 . therefore determination of the signs and magnitudes of @xmath108 and @xmath109 can give quite a useful information about the existence of new physics .",
    "for the choice of @xmath101 , apart from the minor differences in their magnitudes , the behaviors of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are similar as in the previous case .    as is obvious from figs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , @xmath108 and @xmath115 show stronger dependence only on @xmath33 for the @xmath102 decay . again",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 change sign at @xmath116 .",
    "as has already been noted , determination of the sign and magnitude of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are useful hints in looking for new physics .",
    "note that for simplicity all new wilson coefficients in this work are assumed to be real . under this condition @xmath117 and @xmath118 have non - vanishing values coming from the imaginary part of sm , i.e. , from @xmath81 . from figs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) we see that @xmath117 and @xmath118 are strongly dependent on all scalar type interactions for the @xmath69 decay .",
    "similar behavior takes place for the @xmath102 decay as well .",
    "the change in sign and magnitude of both @xmath117 and @xmath118 that are observed in these figures is an indication of the fact that an experimental verification of them can give unambiguous information about new physics .    in the present work",
    "we analyze the possibility of pinning down new physics beyond sm by studying lepton polarizations only .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ unp ] ) that the branching ratio of the @xmath2 decay depends also on the new wilson coefficients and hence we expect that it can give information about new physics . in this connection there follows the question : can one establish new physics by studying the lepton polarizations only ?",
    "in other words , are there regions of the new wilson coefficients @xmath17 in which the value of the branching ratio coincides with that of the sm prediction , but the lepton polarizations would not ? in order to answer this question , we present in figs .",
    "( 11)(14 ) the dependence of the branching ratio on the average and combined average polarizations of the leptons .",
    "in these figures the value of the branching ratio ranges between the values @xmath119 .",
    "these figures depict that there indeed exist such regions of @xmath17 in which the value of the branching ratio does agree with the sm result , while the lepton polarizations differ from the sm prediction .",
    "it follows from the pair of figs .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 11 ) ; ( 7 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 8) , ( 14 ) , that if @xmath33 lies in the region @xmath120 , the above  mentioned condition , i.e. , mismatch of the polarizations in the standard model and the new physics , is fulfilled . on the other hand one can immediately see from fig .",
    "( 12 ) that such a region for the combined average longitudinal lepton polarization does not exist and hence it is not suitable in search of new physics",
    ". note that in all figures intersection point of all curves correspond to the sm case .",
    "this analysis allows us to conclude that there exists certain regions of new wilson coefficients for which study of the lepton polarization itself can give promising information about new physics .    finally , a few words about the detectibilty of the lepton polarization asymmetries at @xmath3 factories or future hadron colliders , are in order . as an estimation ,",
    "we choose the averaged values of the longitudinal polarization of muon and transversal and normal polarizations of the @xmath6 lepton , which are approximately close to the sm prediction , i.e. , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "experimentally , to measure an asymmetry @xmath124 of a decay with the branching ratio @xmath3 at the @xmath125 level , the required number of events is given by the formula @xmath126 .",
    "it follows from this expression that to observe the lepton polarizations @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 in @xmath102 decay at @xmath130 level , the expected number of events are @xmath131 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of @xmath132 pairs that is expected to be produced at @xmath3 factories is about @xmath133 .",
    "a comparison of these numbers allows us to conclude that while measurement of the normal polarization of the @xmath6 lepton is impossible , measurements of the longitudinal polarization of muon and transversal polarization of @xmath6 lepton could be accessible at @xmath3 factories .",

    "<S> it is found that there exist regions of wilson coefficients for which the branching ratio coincides with the standard model result while the lepton polarizations differ substantially from the standard model prediction . </S>",
    "<S> hence , studying lepton polarization in these regions of new wilson coefficients can serve as a promising tool for establishing new physics beyond the standard model .    </S>",
