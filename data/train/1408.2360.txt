    "in recent years , spin dynamics in low - dimensional semiconductor structures , such as quantum wells ( qws ) and quantum dots , have attracted significant scientific interest .",
    "a large number of studies have been conducted on two - dimensional electron systems ( 2dess ) confined in qws , exploiting the symmetry of the spin - orbit fields to control electron spin dynamics .",
    "here , the choice of growth - axis symmetry allows for suppression of spin dephasing for particular spin orientations in ( 110)-grown qws  @xcite , cancellation of rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit fields in ( 111)-grown structures  @xcite , or formation of a persistent spin helix state in ( 001)-grown qws  @xcite .",
    "similar studies using these crystallographic degrees of freedom for two - dimensional hole systems ( 2dhss ) are lacking , even though large anisotropies of the @xmath0 factor  @xcite and suppression of hole spin dephasing  @xcite have been predicted .",
    "this is , in part , due to the difficulties associated with p - modulation doping , which requires different growth strategies depending on the crystallographic orientation of a 2dhs  @xcite .",
    "conventional undoped qws are not suitable for low - temperature spin dynamics studies , as rapid photocarrier recombination limits the observation window for optically oriented carriers to less than 100  ps .",
    "the complex structure of the valence band also complicates studies of hole spin coherence : in gaas - based structures , long - lived hole spin coherence can only be expected if the degeneracy between light - hole ( lh ) and heavy - hole ( hh ) bands that is present in the bulk  @xcite is lifted by confinement . yet even in confined systems , there is a pronounced mixing of lh and hh bands for wave vectors @xmath1  @xcite . thus , long - lived hole spin coherence is only observed for low - density 2dhss at low temperatures  @xcite . in these conditions ,",
    "hole spin dephasing times may rival or even exceed those of conduction - band electrons due to the reduced hyperfine interaction of the p - like holes with surrounding nuclei  @xcite .    to address these challenges",
    ", we utilize a special sample design , which is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "it consists of an _ undoped _",
    "double qw structure with an alas barrier separating a wide and a narrow qw .",
    "the states in the x valley of the alas barriers are energetically close to the electron states in the narrow qw , so that fast electron tunneling is possible  @xcite .",
    "application of a bias voltage between a back contact and a semi - transparent top gate allows tilting of the qw . by resonant optical excitation",
    ", spin - polarized electron - hole pairs can selectively be created in the narrow or the wide qw .",
    "figure  [ fig1](b ) depicts resonant excitation of the narrow qw .",
    "optically oriented electrons rapidly tunnel from the narrow qw into the wide qw , while the holes remain in the narrow qw .",
    "this spatial separation of the optically oriented electron - hole pairs leads to photocarrier lifetimes of the order of several @xmath2s  @xcite , well above the spin dephasing times . by resonant excitation of the wide qw ,",
    "two different regimes are accessible : depending on the gate bias , additional electrons may tunnel into the qw , or some of the optically oriented electrons may tunnel out , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and ( d ) , creating an imbalance between electron and hole concentrations . after direct photocarrier recombination in the qw , which occurs on a 100  ps timescale",
    ", excess spin - polarized carriers remain in the qw , and their spin precession in an in - plane magnetic field can be observed on a nanosecond timescale .    in the following ,",
    "we present time - resolved studies of the spin dynamics for electrons and holes confined in double qw structures grown along different crystallographic orientations .",
    "three samples , grown on ( 001 ) [ sample a ] , ( 110 ) [ b ] , and ( 113a ) [ c ] substrates , are investigated .",
    "we demonstrate gate control of the dominant charge carrier type in the qw , and are able to observe long - lived hole spin precession in all samples .",
    "the ( 001)-grown sample serves as a reference to compare hole spin dynamics in our _ undoped _ double qw structure to previous results obtained on _ p - modulation - doped _ , ( 001)-grown samples  @xcite .",
    "for the ( 113a)- and ( 110)-grown samples , we find a large magnitude , and a pronounced in - plane anisotropy of the hole @xmath0 factor , in good agreement with our theoretical calculations , and a weaker anisotropy of the electron @xmath0 factor . in the ( 110)-grown sample",
    ", we additionally observe an anisotropy of the hole spin dephasing .",
    "all samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on undoped wafers with different crystallographic orientations [ sample a : ( 001 ) b : ( 110 ) , c : ( 113a ) ] .",
    "the active region consists of two gaas qws embedded in alas barriers , following a design introduced in ref .  .",
    "a highly n - doped bulk gaas layer is grown below the active region to serve as a back contact .",
    "this layer is contacted from the top by alloying indium contacts .",
    "the qws have nominal widths of 5  nm ( narrow qw ) and 12  nm ( wide qw ) , respectively , and are separated by an 8  nm wide alas barrier .",
    "a semitransparent top gate was prepared on the samples . for this",
    ", a 10  nm thick sio@xmath3 layer , followed by semitransparent , 6  nm thick nicr layer , were thermally evaporated on top of the sample .",
    "a pulsed ti - sapphire laser system , generating pulses with 2  ps length , and corresponding spectral width of 1  mev , was used for the time - resolved measurements .",
    "the repetition rate of the laser system is 80  mhz , corresponding to a time delay of 12.5  ns between subsequent pulses .",
    "the laser pulses are split into a circularly - polarized pump beam and a linearly - polarized probe beam by a beam splitter .",
    "a mechanical delay line is used to create a variable time delay between pump and probe .",
    "both beams are focused to a diameter of about 80  @xmath2 m on the sample using an achromatic lens .",
    "excitation densities of about 5  w@xmath4 are used for the pump beam , corresponding to an optically induced carrier density of about 1.5  @xmath5  @xmath4 .",
    "low - temperature measurements were performed in an optical cryostat with @xmath6he insert where the samples are cooled to about 1.3  k. magnetic fields of up to 11.5  t can be applied , either in the qw plane or perpendicular to it .    in the trkr and rsa experiments ,",
    "the circularly - polarized pump beam is generating electron - hole pairs in the qw , with spins aligned parallel or antiparallel to the beam direction , i.e. , the qw normal , depending on the helicity of the light . in the trkr measurements",
    ", the spin polarization created perpendicular to the sample plane by the pump beam is probed by the time - delayed probe beam via the kerr effect : the axis of linear polarization of the probe beam is rotated by a small angle , which is proportional to the out - of - plane component of the spin polarization .",
    "this small angle is detected using an optical bridge . a lock - in scheme",
    "is used to increase sensitivity .",
    "the rsa technique is based on the interference of spin polarizations created in a sample by subsequent pump pulses . for certain magnetic fields applied in the sample plane , the optically oriented spin polarization precesses by an integer multiple of @xmath7 in the time window between subsequent pump pulses , so that constructive interference occurs .",
    "this leads to pronounced maxima in the kerr rotation angle , measured for a fixed time delay as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the numerical calculations of zeeman spin splitting have been based on the @xmath8 kane hamiltonian , including the lowest conduction band @xmath9 as well as the highest valence band @xmath10 and the spin split - off valence band @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the in - plane magnetic field @xmath12 was taken into account via the vector potential @xmath13 using the asymmetric gauge @xmath14 . diagonalizing the kane hamiltonian as a function of the kinetic momentum @xmath15",
    "then yields the zeeman - split energy dispersions @xmath16 of the spin subbands @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the presence of the magnetic field @xmath19 .",
    "this model contains the @xmath0 factor only implicitly .",
    "we extract @xmath0 for the lowest hh subband @xmath20 from the zeeman splitting @xmath21 calculated at @xmath22  t using @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the bohr magneton .",
    "we note that the simplified expressions for the anisotropic @xmath0 previously presented in ref .   were based on the smaller , less accurate luttinger hamiltonian containing only the highest valence band @xmath10 .",
    "the luttinger model is thus best suited to describe hole systems in wide qws where the confinement energies are small .",
    "the more accurate kane model used here contains nonparabolic corrections to all orders in the wave vector @xmath25 so that it is appropriate also for the more narrow samples studied here .",
    "all band - structure parameters entering the kane model are well - known from many independent experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculations presented here can be regarded as parameter - free .",
    "numerical algorithms follow ref .  .",
    "first , we validate our sample design by performing time - resolved kerr rotation ( trkr ) measurements on the wide qw of the ( 001)-grown sample a. figure  [ fig2](a ) exemplarily shows three trkr traces measured for different values of the gate bias with a fixed in - plane magnetic field of 2  t. all traces show a pronounced peak of the kerr signal around zero time delay , indicating optical orientation of electron - hole pairs and partial photocarrier recombination within the qw .",
    "this is followed by an exponentially damped oscillation , which we identify as larmor precession of the optically oriented carriers remaining in the qw .",
    "when we compare the two top traces to the bottom trace , we clearly see a large difference in the precession frequencies .",
    "we extract the spin precession frequencies and spin dephasing times ( sdts ) by fitting an exponentially damped cosine function to trkr traces measured for a wide range of bias voltages .",
    "whether the observed spin precession for a certain bias is caused by electrons or holes can be determined via the magnitude of the effective @xmath0 factor .",
    "we note that in our trkr measurements , we can not determine the sign of @xmath0 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . for bias voltages above @xmath26  v , we find a nearly - constant @xmath0 factor value of 0.18 , which we assign to electron spin precession .",
    "the alas barriers in our structure lead to a stronger confinement than the more common al@xmath27ga@xmath28as barrier material , so that the e1-hh1 transition energy in our qw , measured in photoluminescence ( not shown ) is about 1555  mev . in a study of gaas - al@xmath29ga@xmath30as qws with different al concentration , yugova et al . found an effective electron @xmath0 factor of 0.20 for similar transition energies  @xcite , in reasonable agreement with our observations .    as the bias voltage is lowered below @xmath26  v ,",
    "there is a sharp transition to a smaller @xmath0 factor of 0.09 , which we assign to hole spin precession .",
    "in contrast to previous studies on gated p - doped gaas - algaas qws  @xcite , we do not observe a pronounced dependence of the hole @xmath0 factor on the gate bias .",
    "this indicates that the hole wave function does not significantly penetrate into the alas barriers due to the large barrier height .",
    "therefore , there is no bias - dependent admixture of the respective hole @xmath0 factors in the qw and barrier materials .",
    "we note that the ensemble sdt of the holes is significantly larger than that of the electrons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) and increases with decreasing gate bias .",
    "most likely , the dependence of the hole sdt on the gate bias is caused by a combination of two effects : firstly , the tunneling rates of the holes may change with the gate bias , limiting the effective lifetime in the qw .",
    "secondly , the position of the maximum of the hole wave function within the qw shifts with gate bias , so that the @xmath0 factor inhomogeneity may change and influence the ensemble sdt .",
    "this effect will be discussed below in more detail . by contrast",
    ", the electron sdt does not show a strong dependence on the bias , indicating that the effective lifetime of electrons in the qw is limited by tunneling processes involving the x valley states in the barriers .    to explore the limits of hole spin dephasing in our sample , we perform resonant spin amplification ( rsa ) measurements on the narrow qw , as previous studies have shown that the large hh - lh splitting in narrow qws leads to increased hole sdts  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2](c ) shows rsa traces measured for different gate biases for a laser excitation energy slightly above the resonance of the narrow qw . in a large gate voltage range",
    ", optically oriented electrons can rapidly tunnel out of the narrow qw , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , so that excess holes remain in the qw . due to the interplay of hole spin relaxation , spin - selective photocarrier recombination  @xcite and electron tunneling",
    ", we observe rsa maxima also at zero magnetic field , and a sign reversal of the rsa peaks occurs at a finite magnetic field of about 0.2  t. as the magnetic field is increased further , the amplitude of the rsa peaks decays due to hole spin ensemble dephasing caused by the hole @xmath0 factor inhomogeneity , @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a characteristic magnetic - field dependence of the ensemble hole sdt , @xmath32 : @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the hole sdt in the absence of magnetic - field - induced dephasing .",
    "remarkably , the decay of the rsa peaks shows a strong dependence on the gate bias : for large positive bias , rsa signals can be observed up to magnetic fields of more than 2  t. to extract @xmath34 and @xmath35 from the data , we compare the rsa traces to a rate equation model  @xcite ( see appendix ) .",
    "we find a @xmath34 of 10  ns , and a minimum @xmath35 of 0.002 .",
    "the minimum @xmath35 for our double qw structure is below the value previously observed in p - doped qws  @xcite , indicating that the absence of ( modulation ) doping leads to a significant reduction of local potential fluctuations .",
    "a large positive gate bias centers the hole wave function within the narrow qw , so that the effect of @xmath0 factor fluctuations due to interface roughness is minimized as well .",
    "we study the initialization of the hole spin polarization in more detail by varying the laser excitation energy in the rsa measurements for a fixed gate bias . for near - resonant excitation ( upper trace in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ) , there is only a small rsa peak observable at zero magnetic field , and the rsa amplitude builds with increasing field due to electron - precession - induced initialization of a hole spin polarization . as the excitation energy is increased ( middle trace ) , a pronounced zero - field rsa peak is observed , which stems from an indirect initialization of the hole spin polarization . during energy relaxation ,",
    "most of the optically oriented hole spins relax , while the electron spin polarization is conserved . in subsequent photocarrier recombination , spin - polarized electrons predominantly _",
    "remove _ holes with matching spin orientation , initializing a hole spin polarization which is oriented in the opposite direction of the optically oriented holes . as the magnetic field",
    "is increased , the precession - induced initialization becomes dominant , leading to a sign reversal of the rsa peaks . for even larger excitation energy",
    ", we observe a pronounced rsa peak at zero field , and finite - field rsa peaks with the same orientation .",
    "this shape of the rsa trace can be explained by rapid tunneling of spin - polarized electrons out of the qw , which is facilitated by the excess energy due to nonresonant excitation .",
    "therefore , the optically oriented hole spin polarization is not depleted by direct photocarrier recombination at zero magnetic field . the rsa signal for these conditions",
    "can also be simulated precisely using our rate equation model ( see fig .",
    "[ figs1](b ) ) . to summarize , the hole spin dynamics we observe in our ( 001)-grown undoped double qw structure are in good agreement with previous results obtained on _ p - modulation - doped _ , ( 001)-grown samples , demonstrating the validity of our sample design .",
    "the double qw structure shows a smaller hole g factor inhomogeneity than modulation - doped samples due to reduced local potential fluctuations .      in our study of samples b and c ,",
    "we mostly focus on trkr measurements to determine the large hole @xmath0 factor values and the in - plane anisotropy predicted for ( 110)- and ( 113a)-grown qws  @xcite . for both samples ,",
    "we first determine the gate bias range in which a transition from electron- to hole - dominated long - lived spin precession occurs by determining the effective g factor .",
    "this is shown exemplarily for sample c in fig .  [",
    "fig3](a ) . here , the effective g factor shows a sharp transition from a value of about 0.18 for positive gate bias , which we assign to electron spin precession , to a value of about 0.15 as the bias is reduced to 0  v and below , corresponding to hole spin precession .",
    "then , we perform a series of trkr measurements with different magnetic fields for a fixed gate bias in the hole - dominated range , with the magnetic field oriented in the qw plane at an angle @xmath36 relative to the in - plane @xmath37 axis . the effective hole @xmath0 factor is extracted from a linear fit of the magnetic - field - dependent precession frequency . each sample",
    "is manually mounted in four different orientations @xmath36 relative to the magnetic field in subsequent cooling cycles .",
    "we clearly see that the precession frequency for a fixed magnetic field drastically changes with the orientation of the field relative to the crystallographic axis , as fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) exemplarily shows for sample b. this variation is due to the in - plane anisotropy of the hole @xmath0 factor . in the following",

    "remarkably , a significant in - plane anisotropy is obtained here for the narrow 12  nm wide ( 110)-grown qw , whereas such an anisotropy is absent in previous calculations for wider ( 110)-grown qws  @xcite . by contrast , the @xmath0 factor for ( 113)-grown qws does not vary strongly with qw width . for sample c ,",

    "[ fig4](d ) ) . in this sample ,",
    "the hole @xmath0 factor changes by a factor of 4 as a function of the angle @xmath36 .",
    "by contrast , we observe a smaller change of @xmath50 in sample b , and for the in - plane @xmath38 $ ] axis , the calculated value of @xmath50 is slightly smaller than the measured value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) ) .",
    "the latter may be due to our gated sample structure , which leads to a growth - axis asymmetry of the confining potential , corresponding to a further reduction of the effective qw width .",
    "in addition to the large in - plane anisotropy of @xmath50 , there is also a weaker in - plane anisotropy of the electron @xmath0 factor in both samples ( see fig .",
    "[ figs3 ] ) .",
    "this anisotropy was previously observed in narrow ( 110)-grown qws  @xcite . to summarize , our sample design allows us to directly observe a large in - plane anisotropy of the hole g factor for qws grown on low - symmetry surfaces .",
    "the experimental results are in good agreement with realistic calculations of the hh zeeman splitting that take the width of our qw structures into account .",
    "we investigate the magnetic - field dependence of the hole sdt in samples b and c to determine the mechanism limiting hole spin coherence . for this",

    "[ fig3](c ) , demonstrating that the two samples show rather different behavior : in sample b , the hole sdt shows a characteristic @xmath51 dependence as described by eq .",

    ", we find a pronounced rsa maximum for @xmath52  t , with all finite - field rsa maxima having the same orientation .",
    "this shows that the long - lived hole spin polarization is initialized directly by the optically oriented holes , while spin - polarized electrons rapidly tunnel out of the qw , so that there is no complex interplay between electron and hole spin dynamics .",
    "remarkably , we find that the rsa maximum amplitude for zero magnetic field is about two times larger than that of the first finite - field maximum , while the amplitudes of subsequent finite - field maxima decrease slowly , indicating weak ensemble dephasing .",
    "the shape of this rsa trace can not be described within our rate equation model ( see fig .",

    "the characteristic shape of the rsa traces due to hole spin dynamics has been previously studied in p - doped qws  @xcite .",
    "it arises from the interplay of spin and photocarrier dynamics . under resonant optical excitation of a qw ,",
    "oppositely equal electron and hole spin polarizations are created , and in the absence of a magnetic field or other processes which would create an imbalance between electron and hole spin polarizations , spin - polarized electrons recombine with holes that match their spin orientation , so that photocarrier recombination removes the spin polarizations , and no transfer of hole spin polarization to resident carriers occurs .",
    "therefore , in measurements under these conditions , no rsa peak at zero magnetic field is observed . for finite magnetic fields , which lead to different spin precession frequencies for electrons and holes ,",
    "some transfer of spin polarization to resident holes occurs , and rsa peaks are observed .",
    "nonresonant excitation leads to a partial dephasing of the optically oriented hole spin polarization during energy relaxation . during photocarrier recombination ,",
    "optically oriented electrons preferably remove hole spins with matching orientation , so that an excess of hole spins with opposite spin orientation remains in the sample .",
