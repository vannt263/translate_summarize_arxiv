    "a previous study has been devoted to the cluster formation in the absence of walls @xcite .",
    "we first study the evolution of a pair of vesicles in a weak confinement in order to check that we can capture almost the same result .",
    "we have analyzed the evolution of a pair of vesicles in a channel having a width @xmath53 , which corresponds to a weak enough confinement .",
    "we find that the final equilibrium distance is equal to about @xmath54 for @xmath53 .",
    "this result compares well with that obtained in unbounded flow @xcite where the final distance is of about @xmath55 .",
    "we have analyzed systematically the behavior of a pair of vesicles for different confinements ( but still weak enough confinement ) and different initial conditions .",
    "figure [ 13p1 ] shows a typical evolution of the pair interdistance as a function of time for different initial conditions , denoted as @xmath56 in that figure .",
    "we see there that different initial conditions lead to the same final state .",
    "figure [ floww20 ] shows the final configuration of the pair of vesicles as well as the induced flow field , that is the total flow field from which we subtract the imposed poiseuille flow ( as defined in section [ sec : model_subsublevel2 ] ) .",
    "this figure also shows the total flow field .",
    "it can be seen that the induced flow ahead of the leading vesicle ( the one on the right ) is converging towards the vesicle .",
    "this means that if a tracer is placed ahead of the leading vesicle it will be attracted by that vesicle .",
    "this qualitatively hints to the fact that the vesicle would attract small objects placed ahead of it .",
    "the qualitative understanding of this flow field is quite simple , as shown schematically in figure [ flow_schematic ] .",
    "we show there the imposed flow ( black arrows ) , the total flow ( blue ) and the induced flow ( red ) .",
    "consider the flow field ahead of the vesicle at the center line . far away from the vesicle",
    "the total flow field practically coincides with the imposed one ( the perturbation due to the vesicle decays away from the vesicle ) .",
    "consider now a point close enough ahead of the vesicle ( point @xmath57 in the figure ) .",
    "the vesicle moves with a velocity which is smaller than the maximum imposed velocity , so that close enough to the vesicle ( due to velocity continuity ) , the full velocity of the fluid ahead of the vesicle is smaller than the maximum imposed one ( the blue arrow is shorter than the black one ) .",
    "if we consider the induced flow only ( which is what matters for interaction ) , we have to subtract the black arrows ( imposed flow ) from the blue ones ( the full field ) , so that at the center line ahead of the vesicle the induced flow ( red arrows ) points towards the vesicle .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the rear part of the vesicle ( point @xmath58 ) , meaning that the induced flow is directed away from the vesicle .",
    "consider now a point on the side part of the vesicle ( point @xmath59 in the figure ) .",
    "since the vesicle is at the center its velocity is higher than that of the adjacent fluid near on top of point @xmath59 . at point @xmath59 , because of velocity continuity , the vesicle and the fluid move at the same velocity , which is higher than the imposed flow at that point . subtracting the imposed flow from the total flow field around point",
    "@xmath59 shows that the flow field there point to the right .",
    "joining now point @xmath57 , @xmath59 and @xmath58 ( see figure [ flow_schematic ] ) , we obtain the qualitative pattern for the induced flow field where the flow goes from the rear to the front of the vesicle . in order to analyze further this question we have systematically analyzed in details the behavior of the relative velocity of the two centers of mass of the pair of vesicles as a function of their actual interdistance by considering different initial interdistances .",
    "let us denote the leading vesicle by @xmath60 and the following vesicle by @xmath61 , and let @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote their instantaneous positions , and by @xmath64 and @xmath65 the corresponding velocities ( velocity of center of mass has only a component along the wall direction ) .",
    "their relative velocity is given by @xmath66 .",
    "a positive value of @xmath67 means that the two vesicles repel each other , while a negative value means they attract each other .",
    "an equilibrium position corresponds to @xmath68 .",
    "in what follows we will refer to the dimensionless velocity , defined as @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ vander1 ] shows @xmath70 as a function of the dimensionless interdistance between centers of mass , @xmath71 .",
    "we observe a repulsion at short distance and an attraction at long distance .",
    "there is a final equilibrium position characterized by @xmath72 ( denoted as @xmath60 within a dark circle in figure [ vander1 ] ) .",
    "this equilibrium position is unique , independent from the choice of the initial shape  ( figure [ vander12 ] ) .",
    "this defines in a non ambiguous way the equilibrium position . clearly , that equilibrium point is stable , since for higher interdistance the relative velocity is negative , so that the vesicles will attract each other , while the opposite happens for smaller interdistance . generally ,",
    "if the relative velocity crosses zero ( when @xmath73 increases ) from positive to negative values the equilibrium position is stable , and is unstable otherwise .",
    "we have performed this study for several confinements , but still weak enough , and have determined the corresponding equilibrium position .",
    "figure [ diag1 ] shows the branch of equilibrium interdistance @xmath74 as a function of @xmath75 .",
    "the equilibrium interdistance weakly depends on confinement , and remains close to about @xmath76 .",
    "let us now examine the generic behavior for a strong confinement .",
    "consider the case @xmath77 . by studying the evolution of the interdistance as a function of time",
    ", we find that for several initial conditions the pair of vesicles finally settles into a bound and stable steady state .",
    "figure [ w31 ] shows the evolution of the interdistance with time for different initial conditions .",
    "the first noticeable fact is that the equilibrium distance for @xmath77 is significantly larger than that obtained at weak confinement .",
    "for example for @xmath77 the equilibrium interdistance is about @xmath78 , which is twice as large as that obtained in the weak confinement case ( about @xmath79 ) .",
    "a first interpretation would be that the presence of the walls screens the hydrodynamics interaction .",
    "this reasoning is , _ a priori _ , not justified , since the screening concerns both the attraction and repulsion and it is not clear how would the confinement shift the attraction and repulsion zones .",
    "let us first analyze the velocity field in a strong enough confinement regime .",
    "figure [ vw63 ] shows the induced flow field for two confinements @xmath80 and @xmath77 .",
    "we also show there the flow field in the co - moving frame ( the frame moving with the pair ) .",
    "the main difference with the weak confinement is the fact that the flow lines , which extend far away in the weak confinement ( see figure [ floww20 ] ) , are cut - off by confinement in the strong confinement case .",
    "this partially hints to a weaker interaction in magnitude , as we shall see below .",
    "as done above for the weak confinement case , we have analyzed the relative velocity as a function of the relative distance .",
    "a typical result is shown in figure [ vander2 ] .",
    "we obtain a stable equilibrium position , with short - range repulsion and long - range attraction .",
    "we find that the relative velocity amplitude is significantly smaller than that obtained for a weak confinement ( compare with figure [ vander1 ] ) .",
    "this is to be traced back to the screening effect due to the walls that weakens the interaction .",
    "we have performed this study for several confinements , and have determined the equilibrium position .",
    "figure [ diag2 ] shows the branch of equilibrium position @xmath81 as a function of @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast to the weakly confined case ( also shown in figure [ diag2 ] ) the equilibrium distance strongly depends on confinement , and varies from about @xmath82 up to about @xmath83 .",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "we have a new branch of solution for small values of @xmath20 ( the left branch in figure [ diag2 ] ) , different from that discussed above for large @xmath20 ( the right branch in figure [ diag2 ] ) .",
    "the second observation is that we have two distinct branches , one presents an equilibrium distance which increases with @xmath20 , while the other has an equilibrium position which decreases with @xmath20 ..      we have made further studies in order to clarify the overall structure of the topology of the phase diagram .",
    "first , we have tried to analyze the bassin of attraction of the branches by exploring a wider range of initial conditions .",
    "we begin our discussion with the weak confinement case ( large @xmath20 ) .",
    "we have already seen in the previous section that different initial conditions lead to the same final solution . by exploring wider and wider regions of initial conditions ,",
    "we have found a different scenario . by keeping the same confinement @xmath84 ,",
    "as done above , we found that beyond a certain initial pair interdistance , the solution does not evolve anymore to the previous solution , but rather to another solution .",
    "figure [ 13p2](left ) shows the temporal evolution where after @xmath85 the pair interdistance is still evolving , but converges ultimately to a distance of about @xmath86 . for different initial conditions ( smaller initial interdistance ) we found before a final distance of about @xmath87 ( figure [ 13p2](right ) ) .",
    "this clearly shows the coexistence of two different stable solutions .",
    "in general , these two stable solutions should be separated by an unstable solution .",
    "therefore , we need to determine the location of the unstable branch .",
    "we can have access to this by analyzing the relative velocity as a function of interdistance ( as performed before ) .",
    "figure [ vandercom ] shows the result , where the points denoted as 1 , 2 and 3 in the figure , refer to the location where the pair relative velocity vanishes .",
    "since the relative velocity around point 3 is very small , we have made a zoom in order to reveal the structure of the evolution of the relative velocity .",
    "points 1 and 3 are stable , whereas point 2 is unstable .    we have made a systematic analysis of this kind by varying the confinement ( i.e. @xmath20 ) in order to build the full diagram representing the equilibrium solutions ( like point 1 , 2 and 3 ) as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ diag_full ] .",
    "we see that the branch for high @xmath20 undergoes a fold singularity in the form of a saddle - node bifurcation , where a stable solution ( represented by solid line ) merges with an unstable solution ( dashed line ) .",
    "the branch arising at low @xmath20 continues to exist ( as a stable solution ) beyond the saddle - node point , and does not show , for the values of @xmath20 explored so far , any tendency of disappearance .",
    "theoretically , this branch either continues to exist for any @xmath20 , or may undergo a fold singularity , which is one of the scenario expected from catastrophe theory .",
    "since for large @xmath20 the relative velocity is too small , the question of the behavior of the branch at large enough @xmath20 has only an academic interest .",
    "we shall thus not dwell further on this issue here .",
    "finally , let us say few words on the strength of interaction as a function of confinement .",
    "as can be expected , the confinement reduces the strength of interaction , due to screening . to understand the difference of the pairing mechanism at large and small channel widths we first consider a pair of vesicles in two different channels of width @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the time evolution of the interdistances in each channel is shown in figure [ fig::fig6 ] .",
    "the time needed to reach the steady state for different channel widths has been investigated .",
    "we found that their interdistance reduces by approximatively @xmath90 the pair of vesicles needs around @xmath91 in a channel of width @xmath80 whereas only @xmath92 are needed to reduce their interdistance by @xmath93 in a channel of width @xmath94 .",
    "since a typical time @xmath95 for rbc is about @xmath96 s , this gives about 10 s in the first case .",
    "note also that in reality there are always fluctuations and imperfection so that the cells are not all at the same lateral position . for example",
    ", if the leading cell is slightly off - centered its velocity may be sensibly different from the following cell , so that the time needed to reach the bound state may occur at a significantly shorter time scale than @xmath97 s.      in this section we describe the effect of the capillary number on the main results .",
    "we consider a pair of cells with four different capillary numbers @xmath98 and flowing in channels of width ranging from @xmath99 to @xmath100 ( @xmath101 @xmath102 to @xmath103 @xmath104 for rbcs ) .",
    "figure [ fig::fig16_ca_w_di ] depicts the stationary interparticle spacing as a function of the channel width for different capillary numbers ( we do not show the full branch as before due to computational cost , and especially because we do not see any significant changes ) .",
    "the stationary shape of the vesicles at high confinement ( @xmath105 ) is asymmetric for @xmath106 .",
    "the shape asymmetry decreases with the increase of the capillary number and a transition from asymmetric to symmetric shapes is observed at @xmath107 ( figure [ fig::fig16_ca_w_di ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the shapes become fully symmetric for a channel width @xmath108 and the final pair interdistance tend to the same value , independent from the capillary number . for",
    "@xmath109 the choice of the initial shapes does not affect the stationary solution whereas for @xmath110 it leads to two different solutions in the region of transition resulting in a decrease of the stationary interdistance if starting with parachutes and the opposite if starting with ellipses .",
    "( figure [ fig::fig16_ca_w_di ] ( c ) and ( d ) ) . the time needed to reach the stationary shape is proportional to the capillary number ( higher @xmath111 is shorter the time needed to transform an ellipse to a parachute ) which explains the dependency on the initial shapes at low @xmath111 .",
    "globally , the capillary number seems to not significantly affect the behavior of the pair",
    ".    for vesicles , higher values of @xmath112 can be reasonably reached , such as @xmath113 . for a vesicle of radius @xmath114 ,",
    "a channel radius of @xmath115 , and a velocity of @xmath116 , one finds approximately @xmath117 . by assuming that the relative velocity scale with @xmath112 ( as shown in figure [ vrelat_ca100 ] )",
    ", one finds that the relative velocity is of about @xmath118 , which is no devoid of experimental testability .",
    "the above study has focused on the case of a pair of vesicles .",
    "the question thus arises of whether this would allow us to draw some general conclusion about the size of clusters when more cells are present .",
    "the situation is quite complex , and here we only quote some basic examples leaving a systematic study to the future . in a recent work @xcite it has been reported that , in an unconfined poiseuille flow , the cluster size depends on the flow strength : a higher flow strength leads to a larger cluster size . while this tendency is confirmed here , we find that even for a large enough @xmath20 ( about @xmath100 ) where the confinement might be considered as weak , we obtain some important differences with the unconfined case @xcite .",
    "we have considered the largest @xmath112 explored in @xcite ( @xmath119 ) , and for which it has been reported that the largest stable cluster contains 10 cells ( for a reduced area @xmath120 ) .",
    "we have investigated here the largest stable cluster in the presence of a weak confinement .",
    "figure [ cluster ] shows different initial configurations of parachute - like cells initialized as clusters of different sizes and their corresponding final state .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath53 , the cluster is stable as long as the number of cells is smaller than , or equal to , 4 . beyond @xmath121",
    "the leading cells detach progressively one after the other from the initial cluster with a variable time gap until decreasing the number of cells within the cluster down to 4 ( see the movies in the supplementary material ) .",
    "the maximum size of a stable cluster obtained in unconfined flow was @xmath122 , whereas here we obtain @xmath123 in a weakly confined flow corresponding to @xmath53 ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "this clearly means that the confinement , despite being weak , alters significantly the results . in a future study",
    "we plan to analyze in detail the dependence of the largest stable cluster size on the confinement .",
    "this study has reported on a complex phase diagram regarding hydrodynamic interaction between two vesicles in a confined pressure - driven flow .",
    "it is found that several branches of stationary solutions coexist .",
    "it would be interesting in the future to extend this study to the three - dimensional case both for vesicles and rbcs .",
    "another important ingredient is to analyze the interplay between hydrodynamic interaction and that due to plasma proteins and study how the structure of the phase diagram reported here evolves in this case .",
    "another interesting task for future investigations is to study collective behaviors when many cells are present and determine the link between the spatio - temporal organization and the rheology .",

    "<S> the hydrodynamics - induced pairing mechanism of deformable closed bilayer membranes ( vesicles , a model for red blood cells ) is studied numerically with a special attention paid to the role of the confinement ( the vesicles are within two rigid walls ) . </S>",
    "<S> this study unveils the complexity of the pairing mechanism due to hydrodynamic interactions . at weak confinement </S>",
    "<S> we find that two vesicles attract each other and form a stable pair if their initial distance is below a certain value . </S>",
    "<S> if the initial distance is beyond that distance , the vesicles repel each other and adopt a larger stable interdistance . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for the same confinement we have ( at least ) two stable branches and whether one branch prevails over the other depends only on initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> an unstable branch is found between these two stable branches . at a critical confinement the stable branch corresponding to </S>",
    "<S> the smallest interdistance merges together with the unstable branch in the form of a saddle - node bifurcation . at this critical confinement </S>",
    "<S> we have a finite jump from a solution corresponding to an unbounded case to a solution which is induced by the presence of walls . </S>",
