    "self - amplified spontaneous emission free electron lasers ( sase fels ) @xcite are nowadays considered as a unique tool for production of intense , polarized , short - pulse radiation tunable throughout the vuv and x - ray wavelength range , with peak and average brilliance exceeding both modern synchrotron radiation and laser plasma sources by many order of magnitudes @xcite .",
    "successful operation of sase fels requires high quality ( low emittance and low energy spread ) , intense electron beams .",
    "one of the trends for sase fels is production of ultra - short radiation pulses .",
    "these can be obtained by exploiting electron bunches with an ultra - short charge concentration ( spike ) . at the flash facility at desy , hamburg @xcite , electron bunches with sharp spikes",
    "have been produced in the framework of a nonlinear bunch - compression scheme .",
    "experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of flash operation have shown that properties of ultra - short pulses are significantly influenced by collective effects , the most important of them being space - charge effects .",
    "space - charge plays an important role in the beam - formation system , in the drift space and also in a long undulator .",
    "collective effects might be crucially important for x - ray sase fels ( xfels ) as well .",
    "this article presents a description of longitudinal wake fields in xfels .",
    "in particular , our study is of importance in connection with novel schemes of radiation production , like enhanced sase schemes ( esase ) @xcite .",
    "esase proposals rely on two steps .",
    "first , the electron beam is modulated in energy by interacting with a gw - level optical laser in a modulator wiggler placed in the accelerator section .",
    "second , a dispersive section transforms the energy modulation into density modulation , eventually leading to a subfemtosecond - long spike in the beam current before the entrance in the fel undulator .",
    "the peak current of this spike can reach tens of ka without emittance worsening , because only a small charge is concentrated in the high - current region .",
    "as the electron beam undergoes the sase process , the enhanced current part should saturate faster than the rest of the bunch .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray wavelength may be reduced , for a fixed undulator length .",
    "moreover ultra - short pulses ( in the attosecond range ) are produced as a result of the presence of the short lasing spike .",
    "faster saturation of emission from the enhanced - current spike also suggests that esase schemes may be used to obtain saturation even in situations when beam parameters deteriorate with respect to design values .",
    "a detailed study of longitudinal wake fields arising after the dispersive section , in particular dominant space - charge wake fields is due in order to assess the magnitude of detrimental effects on the fel process .",
    "it is important to note that the undulator parameter @xmath3 for xfel setups obeys @xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "the average longitudinal lorentz factor @xmath5 is such that @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the lorentz factor of the beam .",
    "based on @xmath8 , we will demonstrate that the presence of the undulator strongly influences the space - charge wake .",
    "in contrast to this , in @xcite , wake calculations for the lcls case are given in free - space , as if the presence of the undulator were negligible .",
    "authors of references @xcite incorrectly conclude that the fel process is basically unaffected by space - charge wakes .",
    "this paper is devoted to the calculation of impedance and longitudinal wake field in xfels , with particular attention to the lcls case , for which esase schemes have been first proposed .",
    "this means that we will restrict our attention to a very specific region of parameters , discussed in the next section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "first , the longitudinal size of the beam is much larger than the fel wavelength .",
    "second , electrons are assumed to have travelled into the undulator for a distance longer than the overtaking length .",
    "third , effects of metallic surroundings can be neglected . when the electron - beam size is larger than the radiation diffraction size calculated from a single undulator period , @xmath9 being the reduced wavelength of coherent radiation and @xmath10 the undulator period .",
    "] , major simplifications arise .",
    "in fact , radiation from the undulator is drastically suppressed and calculations of impedance and wake function can be performed considering a non - radiating beam , and thus accounting for space - charge interactions only .",
    "then , space - charge impedance and wake function is found to reproduce the free - space case .",
    "only , the lorentz factor @xmath7 must be consistently substituted with the average longitudinal lorentz factor @xmath11 . in section",
    "[ sec : main ] we derive the electric field that will be used to calculate impedance and wake . in section [ sub : wake ] we introduce concepts of impedance and wake field .",
    "fields are calculated in section [ sec : main ] , while impedances and wakes are respectively dealt with in section [ sec : impe ] and section [ sub : resu ] .",
    "then , in section [ sec : expl ] , we apply our theory to the esase setup referring to the lcls facility .",
    "we calculate the energy chirp associated with wakes inside the undulator and between dispersive section and undulator .",
    "subsequently , the magnitude of their effect is estimated by calculating the linear energy chirp parameter @xcite .",
    "we find that the gain of the fel process is sensibly reduced , and that longitudinal wake fields constitute a reason of concern regarding the practical realization of esase schemes .",
    "conclusions end our treatment in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "as has been said in the introduction , results of this paper can be applied to calculate effects of wake fields in planar undulators under a specific choice of parameters corresponding to an xfel system .",
    "quantities of interest are defined once the bunch and the undulator system are specified .",
    "the bunch is characterized by an rms length @xmath12 , a transverse rms dimension @xmath13 and lorentz factor @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we define the undulator period @xmath14 , the vacuum chamber transverse dimension @xmath15 and the undulator parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the negative electron charge , @xmath18 the peak undulator magnetic field on - axis , and @xmath19 the rest mass of the electron . finally , @xmath20 is the saturation length of the fel process .",
    "the bunch length @xmath12 corresponds to the reduced wavelength of the coherent field generated by the bunch , @xmath21 .",
    "this ( reduced ) wavelength is much longer than the reduced resonant wavelength @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the already defined average longitudinal lorentz factor .",
    "this means @xmath25 .",
    "the overtaking length is defined by the quantity @xmath26 .",
    "when the bunch has travelled inside the undulator for more than @xmath27 a steady state is reached , and asymptotic expressions for the wake fields can be given . in the present study we will work with such asymptotic expressions only .",
    "this means that the saturation length of the fel process , @xmath20 , must be much longer than the overtaking length , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "also , in this paper we will neglect the presence of the vacuum chamber .",
    "this is possible when the vacuum chamber dimension is much larger than @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 , a typical transverse dimension associated with the coherent field , that is verified for esase xfel setups .",
    "summing up , we will work under the following constraints :    @xmath31    based on conditions in ( [ cons1 ] ) , we will develop a theory of wake fields from undulators in xfels .",
    "in particular , the first assumption greatly simplifies our consideration allowing for a long - wavelength asymptotic treatment . under the second and the third assumption we will be able to present an expression for the impedance in terms of a double convolution involving the charge density distribution and bessel functions .",
    "similarly , an analytical expression for the wake function could be given .",
    "however , it will not be necessary to explicitly calculate this expression .",
    "in fact , when discussing practical applications , we will work in the asymptotic case    @xmath32    extra - condition ( [ cons2 ] ) greatly simplifies the treatment of wake fields .",
    "our results can be directly applied to realistic situations as the esase scheme analyzed in section [ sec : expl ] , where we will refer , explicitly , to the lcls case .",
    "calculation of longitudinal wake field and impedance from an fel undulator is subject to the characterization of the electric field generated at a given position ( that is the position of a test electron ) by the entire bunch .",
    "we perform an analysis in terms of harmonics , i.e. we consider sinusoidal dependence of the electric field of the kind @xmath33+c.c.$ ] , the symbol `` c.c . ''",
    "indicating complex conjugation .",
    "expressions for the field at negative values of @xmath34 can be obtained based on the property @xmath35 starting from explicit expressions for @xmath36 at @xmath37 . ] . here",
    "@xmath38 is the time , @xmath39 is the frequency , with @xmath40 the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the complex amplitude @xmath41 can actually be considered as the representation of the electric field in the space - frequency domain , and it will be referred to as `` the field '' .",
    "we assume that particles proceed along an undulator , under the constraints discussed in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the transverse field @xmath42 can be treated in terms of paraxial maxwell s equations in the space - frequency domain ( see e.g. @xcite ) . from the paraxial approximation",

    "the overtaking length is now @xmath432 m , so that @xmath433 and our asymptotic expression for the wake are still valid with some accuracy . using the same procedure as for the wake inside the undulator ( but considering @xmath7 instead of @xmath11 ) , we obtain an extra energy chirp of about @xmath434 mev",
    ".    the sum of contributions from the straight section after the dogleg and from the undulator amounts to about @xmath435 mev . although the energy chirp is non - linear , in order to estimate the magnitude of the effect we can use the linear energy chirp parameter @xmath436 defined in @xcite .",
    "the effect of linear energy chirp starts to play a significant role on the fel gain when @xmath437 .",
    "intuitively , this means that the relative energy change becomes comparable with the fel parameter on the scale of the coherence length .",
    "the chirp parameter is defined as @xmath438 , @xmath439 being the one - dimensional @xmath440-parameter in fel theory defined as ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath441^{1/3 } \\label{rho1ddef } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath442 is the beam current density and the coupling factor @xmath443 , for a planar undulator , is given by @xmath444 , where @xmath445 .",
    "for esase schemes at lcls @xmath446 ka , and we have @xmath447 . using an estimated peak - to - peak chirp of @xmath435 mev we obtain @xmath448 .",
    "thus , the saturation length is significantly modified @xcite .",
    "this is a reason of concern , because esase schemes are based on the assumption that the nominal saturation length of about @xmath449 m is shortened to about @xmath435 m , that is only @xmath450 less .",
    "the effect described here is fundamental , in the sense that it can not be avoided by fine tuning of the setup parameters .",
    "finally , it should be noted that in this paper we did not account for the symmetric part of the wake , related with transition undulator radiation .",
    "this part constitutes only a correction to our calculations , as the space - charge wake accumulates along the longitudinal axis , being proportional to @xmath451 .",
    "we did not include it in this article , because the space - charge wake alone is enough to raise concern .",
    "numerical estimations presented in this paper indicate that effects of energy chirp induces by space - charge longitudinal wake pose a serious threat to the operation of esase schemes at lcls .",
    "in this paper we presented a theory of wake fields in an xfel system , with particular emphasis to esase schemes @xcite .",
    "we worked with specific constraints on parameters , that are fulfilled in xfel setups ( see section [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "namely , we neglected the influence of the vacuum chamber and we assumed that the saturation length is long with respect to the overtaking length .",
    "our results are valid for arbitrary values of the undulator parameter @xmath3 and in the long wavelength asymptotic , i.e. @xmath25 , @xmath452 being the reduced wavelength of the fundamental harmonic .",
    "note that , for any fel setup , the lasing part of the bunch is always much longer than @xmath452 so that condition @xmath25 is very natural .",
    "it follows that our results are of practical importance not only in relation with esase schemes , but for any fel setup .",
    "we derived expressions for the steady state impedance , that is composed of a radiative and a space - charge part .",
    "radiation field and space - charge field are characterized by different formation lengths : the undulator period @xmath10 and the overtaking length @xmath175 , respectively . as a result , the steady state",
    "radiative part of the impedance can be applied for any undulator system ( with @xmath352 ) , whereas the steady state space - charge part of the impedance can be used only assuming that the saturation length is long with respect to the overtaking length , which limits its practical region of applicability .",
    "non - steady state results for the space - charge part of the impedance can be obtained applying methods presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after having dealt with a generic expression for the steady - state impedance , we specialized our theory to the case when the transverse beam size @xmath379 .",
    "major simplifications arise in this case : in particular , space - charge contributions to impedance and wake dominate with respect to radiative contributions . in this particular condition ,",
    "that is practically fulfilled for esase xfel setups , we showed that the ( antisymmetric ) wake can be given in terms of an asymptotic expression for the wake generated by a beam in uniform motion along the longitudinal axis ( see @xcite ) , provided that the lorentz factor @xmath7 is consistently substituted with the average longitudinal lorentz factor @xmath11 .",
    "final expressions are presented in the case of a planar undulator . however , there are no specific effects related with such choice , and our work may be straightforwardly extended to the case of a helical undulator as well .",
    "we applied our theory to calculate the effects of longitudinal wake fields on esase schemes .",
    "our conclusion is that longitudinal wake fields pose a threat to the practical realization of esase schemes .",
    "this finding is in contrast with estimations in literature , where no important detrimental effect is foreseen .",
    "the reason for this contrast is an incorrect application , in literature , of expressions that are valid for beam lines containing drift sections and focusing elements to describe the case of xfel undulators , where the longitudinal lorentz factor is sensibly different .",
