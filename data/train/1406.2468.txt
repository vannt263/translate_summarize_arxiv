    "quasars and other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are accreting supermassive black holes ( bhs ) . among the prominent features in their spectra are broad emission lines , which are thought to arise from a broad line region ( blr ) close to the bh in which gas has been photoionized by the quasar continuum emission .",
    "the line widths are believed to arise from doppler shifts , typically thousands of @xmath3 , due to orbital motion of the gas in the gravitational field of the bh , and/or large - scale inflows or outflows . this general picture is supported by measurements of the blr size through reverberation mapping ( rm ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on larger spatial scales ,",
    "where the dynamical influence of the bh is less important , there is a narrow line region ( nlr ) , where the gas emits with typical line widths of hundreds of @xmath3 .",
    "unification schemes @xcite seek to explain the diverse properties of agn as a result of viewing a single generic structure with different viewing angles .",
    "the typical unification scheme includes , in order of increasing size , the central bh , a surrounding accretion disk , the blr , a thick dusty torus aligned with the disk that obscures the accretion disk and the blr when viewed at high inclinations , and the nlr . whether or not the accretion disk and blr are obscured produces the dichotomy between broad - line ( type 1 ) and narrow - line ( type 2 ) agn .",
    "the proximity of the blr to the bh allows us to look for special- and general - relativistic effects on the observed broad lines , and thereby to test relativity or , more plausibly , to constrain the structure of the blr assuming relativity is correct .",
    "there have been several attempts in the past to detect relativistic effects in broad quasar lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these studies mostly lacked a general treatment that included all relativistic effects , and were limited to small samples of objects where the relativistic effects are easily swamped by astrophysical effects such as object - to - object variations in the line profiles .",
    "a complementary approach has been to model the blr as a rotating , axisymmetric disk ( `` disk - emitter '' models ) , include relativistic effects rigorously , at least to @xmath4 @xcite , and fit these models to the small fraction of quasars that show double - peaked broad line profiles , which are likely to be produced by inclined disks in which the emission is dominated by a small range of radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , disk - emitter models of the blr have yet to be tested against the general quasar population .",
    "a robust detection of relativistic effects in quasar broad lines is therefore still absent .    in this work we present a simple treatment of relativistic effects on the spectrum of the blr , and use kinematic properties of the broad line ( centroid velocity shift and line width ) to constrain the geometry of the blr , assuming that the gas is in a steady state and that its kinematics are determined by the gravitational field of the central bh ( `` virialized '' ) .",
    "we use the large spectroscopic quasar sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which allows us to average out object - to - object measurement errors and variations in line profile .",
    "first , we examine simple models of the structure of the blr to illustrate how relativistic effects can discriminate between models . in all of our models",
    "we assume that the blr gas is in a steady - state dynamical equilibrium , orbiting under the influence of the gravitational field of the central bh ( `` virial equilibrium '' ) .",
    "let @xmath5 be the observed wavelength of the line photon in the rest frame of the central bh and @xmath6 the rest wavelength of the line transition .",
    "the corresponding photon energy is @xmath7 with @xmath8 and the redshift is @xmath9 .",
    "the redshift of the rest frame of the bh is assumed to be the same as the redshift of the narrow - line region of the quasar ; thus @xmath10 is related to the observed redshift of the broad and narrow lines by @xmath11 .    for each model",
    "we determine the relation between the mean redshift @xmath12 and the rms redshift @xmath13 .",
    "in general @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a typical velocity in the blr .",
    "one complication in comparing with the extensive earlier work on this subject is that some authors measure the photon - weighted mean while others measure the energy - weighted mean .",
    "let @xmath16 be the energy flux received at the detector in the wavelength range @xmath17 .",
    "we define the moment @xmath18 then the photon- and energy - weighted mean redshifts are given by @xmath19 instead of the wavelength shift some authors use the frequency shift , @xmath20 in general all four of these quantities will be different .",
    "although these distinctions are important in measuring the mean wavelength or frequency shift , we need make no such distinction between the second moments @xmath21 and @xmath22 or between photon- and energy - weighted second moments , since these are already @xmath4 . in particular we can write @xmath23 to @xmath4 for both photon - weighted and energy - weighted averages and all of these quantities are equal to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion or the standard deviation of the spectral line .",
    "the following derivations and formulas are well - known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we collect them here for reference .",
    "we denote the quasar rest frame by spacetime coordinates @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that this is the rest frame of the quasar s central bh and of the narrow - line region .",
    "we denote the rest frame of an emitting mass element of the blr by coordinates @xmath27 and for simplicity we assume that @xmath28 when @xmath29 . if the velocity of the emitting element relative to the quasar rest frame is @xmath30 , then @xmath31 where @xmath32 and in this subsection we have set the speed of light @xmath33 to unity for brevity .",
    "similarly , the momentum and energy in the two frames are related by @xmath34 for photons @xmath35 , @xmath36 , so if we write @xmath37 we have @xmath38    if the mass element emits photons with wavelength @xmath6 in its rest frame , the wavelength in the quasar rest frame is @xmath39 let @xmath40 be the cosine of the angle between the path of the emitted photon and the velocity vector in the quasar rest frame , with a similar definition for @xmath41 in the rest frame of the emitter .",
    "then from equations ( [ eq : lor3 ] ) @xmath42 thus the elements of solid angle in the two frames are related by @xmath43    if photons are emitted at a rate @xmath44 into a small element of solid angle @xmath45 in the rest frame of the emitting material , then they are received at a rate @xmath46 within a small element of solid angle @xmath47 ; here @xmath48 is the emission time in the rest frame of the emitter and @xmath49 is the time when they are received in the frame of the observer . if the observer is at position @xmath50 then @xmath51 .",
    "the emitting element has @xmath52 so equations ( [ eq : lor1 ] ) give @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; then @xmath55 since @xmath56 is astronomically large we can drop the terms proportional to @xmath57 . then @xmath58 the subscript `` @xmath59 '' indicates that this is the rate at which photons are received by the observer .",
    "at this point a subtle correction is required .",
    "let @xmath60 be the total number of photons that are in transit from the emitter to the observer , with momenta pointing into the solid angle @xmath47 .",
    "in the rest frame of the observer @xmath61 ( recall that @xmath62 ) .",
    "the rate of change of the photon number is @xmath63 .",
    "if the rate of emission of photons is @xmath64 then by continuity @xmath65 so @xmath66 . we may then ask , is the shape of the observed spectral line determined by @xmath64 or @xmath67 , which differ because of the changing number of photons in transit . in a steady - state system , with emitting elements traveling both towards and away from the observer , the total number of photons in transit should be constant after averaging over all the emitting elements .",
    "this means that the average should be taken over the rate at which photons are emitted rather than the rate at which they are detected ; that is , we should work with @xmath68 @xcite calls this the `` light cone effect '' and argues as follows .",
    "we see emitting bodies on the past light cone .",
    "their separation @xmath69 along the line of sight on the light cone is related to their separation at fixed time @xmath70 by @xmath71 so their observed density is larger than the density at fixed time by a factor @xmath72 . in other words",
    "we see more mass elements moving away from us than toward us . to correct for this effect in a steady - state system",
    ", we must multiply @xmath67 by @xmath73 , which converts equation ( [ eq : ndotr ] ) to equation ( [ eq : ndot ] ) and @xmath74 is also discussed by @xcite . ] .",
    "if the photons are emitted in a spectral line with energy @xmath75 then the rate of energy emission in the observer frame is @xmath76 this can be rewritten in terms of the energy flux per unit wavelength at the detector , @xmath77.\\ ] ]    if the emitting region is optically thin , and composed of a large number of discrete clouds that radiate isotropically , then @xmath78 is independent of direction and the integrals ( [ eq : jdef ] ) become @xmath79 where the brackets @xmath80 denote a luminosity - weighted average over the clouds . to o@xmath81 ,",
    "@xmath82 , \\label{eq : jniso2}\\ ] ] in which we have assumed that @xmath83 as required for a steady state .",
    "then , for example , equation ( [ eq : zbar ] ) yields an energy - weighted mean redshift @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "the subscript `` sr '' is a reminder that this calculation accounts only for special - relativistic effects .",
    "in addition there is a gravitational redshift equal to @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the gravitational potential . for a point - mass potential like that of a bh",
    ", the virial theorem implies that @xmath88 in a steady state ; this is a classical result but relativistic corrections are of higher order than we are considering . adding this correction yields @xmath89 , @xmath90 , both to @xmath85 .",
    "thus the photon- and energy - weighted mean redshifts are @xmath91 the analogous equations ( [ eq : nubar ] ) for the frequency shift are @xmath92    for a spherically symmetric distribution of clouds @xmath93 and we have @xmath94 for comparison , @xcite finds ( at the end of his  3 ) @xmath95 which after adding the gravitational redshift yields @xmath96 , consistent with our result .",
    "if the clouds are in an optically thin disk , with normal inclined by @xmath97 to the line of sight , then @xmath98 so @xmath99 @xmath100    if the emitting material is an optically thick disk , @xmath101 is proportional to @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the angle between the disk normal @xmath104 and the photon momentum in the rest frame of the emitting material .",

    "@xcite derive an expression for the line profile @xmath115 expected from an accretion disk ; their derivation correctly captures all of the relativistic effects considered here .",
    "in addition , chen et al .  include the effects of gravitational lensing by the bh and calculate the shape of the line profile , not just its first moment .",
    "lensing can affect the line profile but to the order we are considering its effects are symmetric in @xmath10 and so do not affect the first moment .    a complete description of relativistic effects in the spectra of optically thick disks is given by @xcite .",
    "a simple model for the blr consists of a large number of clouds , distributed in a sphere , moving under the influence of the gravity of the central bh , and in virial equilibrium .",
    "the density of clouds is sufficiently small that the blr is optically thin .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is related to the mean - square velocity by @xmath116 , and the mean redshift is given by equation ( [ eq : sphere ] ) , @xmath117 where here and henceforth we restore factors of @xmath33 to the formulas .",
    "this result is independent of the shape of the velocity ellipsoid in the phase - space distribution of the clouds .    since @xmath118 is typically @xmath119 for our sample , the mean redshift @xmath120",
    "is expected to be much less than the line width @xmath25 .",
    "thus , while the rms width can be determined fairly reliably for a single quasar , the expected mean redshift can not .",
    "therefore we must average over many quasars .",
    "let @xmath121 denote the average over all quasars in our sample with rms width in a small range around @xmath25 , with equal weight given to each quasar .",
    "then in spherical models @xmath122      the notion of a disk - like blr is not new in the literature .",
    "early evidence came from observations of radio - loud quasars , where the orientation of the accretion disk can be inferred from the resolved radio jet morphology , and the observed correlation between the width of the broad h@xmath0  line and the jet orientation can be accounted for if the blr is a disk whose symmetry axis is aligned with the radio axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a second argument for a disk - like blr comes from the success of disk - emitter models in explaining double - peaked broad line profiles in some quasars @xcite .",
    "dynamical modeling of rm data sets also favors a disk geometry in several local broad - line agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a blr disk with a small radial extent and moderate inclination should lead to a double - peaked broad line profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , only about a few percent of blrs in the general quasar population exhibit double - peaked lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which suggests that a wide range of radii in the disk contributes significantly to the observed emission .",
    "the derivations in this paper use angle brackets @xmath123 to denote luminosity - weighted averages over the spatial extent of the blr and are equally valid whatever the range of radii in the blr may be .",
    "we assume that the blr is a flat disk whose normal is inclined by an angle @xmath97 to the line of sight , in which the emitting material travels on circular orbits uniformly distributed in azimuth .",
    "the velocity @xmath15 is then the circular speed at a given radius .",

    "this difference in the dependence of mean redshift on @xmath25 and fwhm is actually expected : for the broad h@xmath0  line , the ratio fwhm@xmath241 is known to increase with line width ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has long been suggested that the line shape ( fwhm@xmath241 ratio ) is an indicator of the orientation of the blr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in such a scenario , the blr has two components : a flattened component ( i.e. , a thin disk ) , and an isotropic component ( either from isotropic turbulence in the disk or from a separate , spherical component of the blr ) .",
    "the fwhm mainly measures the core of the line , and is more sensitive to the disk component , while @xmath25 is more sensitive to the isotropic component in the line wings .",
    "thus larger fwhm@xmath241 ratios are biased towards more edge - on ( higher inclination ) systems .",
    "our approach outlined in  2 automatically takes into account the orientation bias in line width .",
    "the mean redshift among the low - dispersion quasars in our sample ( @xmath242 , 46% of the sample ) is only @xmath243 , consistent with zero . therefore if there are substantial systematic errors or inflows / outflows , then either two or more effects cancel ( e.g. , the redshift from relativistic effects cancels the blueshift from an outflow ) , which seems unlikely but not impossible , or inflows / outflows in the broad- and narrow - line components and systematic errors all contribute less than a few tens of @xmath3 to the mean redshift for @xmath244 .",
    "in particular , if the sample - averaged blueshift from an outflow is less than @xmath245 , equation ( [ eq : outflow ] ) implies that the sample - averaged outflow velocity perpendicular to the disk is less than @xmath246 of the local circular speed .     for the quasar sample , where @xmath231 is the continuum luminosity and @xmath247 is the eddington luminosity based on a virial estimate of the bh mass.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",

    "the quasars with low dispersion typically have larger eddington ratios .",
    "if outflows are preferentially launched in quasars with high eddington ratios , then objects with smaller dispersions may be more biased to outflows , which will lower the mean redshift .",
