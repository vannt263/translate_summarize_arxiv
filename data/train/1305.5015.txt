    "magnetic field induced scattering resonances give cold atom experiments the ability to tune the strength of inter - atomic interactions @xcite .",
    "for example , for fields in the range @xmath1 , the scattering length in a gas of fermionic @xmath0 changes by several orders of magnitude .",
    "studies of superfluidity at these fields have revolutionized our understanding of the connections between bcs - pairing of fermions and bose - einstein condensation of composite bosons .",
    "recent attention has turned to ",
    "narrow \" resonances , where the characteristic field over which the scattering length changes is @xmath2 @xcite . as will be described below , the scattering properties near narrow resonances are more complicated , featuring energy dependences which are not captured by the scattering length . here",
    "we study how this energy dependence is manifest in radio frequency ( rf ) spectra .",
    "when the de broglie wavelength of an atomic gas is large compared to the range of interactions , one is in the cold - collision limit , and all scattering properties are encoded in the s - wave scattering amplitude @xmath3 . the scattering cross section between particles with relative momentum",
    "@xmath4 is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "low energy scattering is typically characterized by the s - wave scattering length @xmath6 .",
    "the scattering length is a function of magnetic field , diverging at the feshbach resonance field @xmath7 , with the functional form @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the width of the resonance , and @xmath10 is the background scattering length , describing the scattering far from resonance .",
    "these resonances are generically associated with a crossing between a  closed channel \" molecular state and the open - channel continuum .",
    "the characteristic scale over which @xmath11 changes is given by @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the difference in the magnetic moments of the two channels . if @xmath14 for a typical collision , then the scattering length is insufficient to describe the physics .",
    "recently , ho _ et al .",
    "_ have pointed out that for a narrow resonance , because of the energy dependence of the phase shift , the interaction energy is highly asymmetric and strong interactions persist even for @xmath15 on the bcs side @xcite .",
    "this observation is consistent with the studies of jensen _ et al .",
    "_ at the impact of the effective range on the thermodynamics of the bcs - bec crossover @xcite , and few - body studies by petrov @xcite .",
    "schwenk and pethick used related arguments to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter @xcite .    following these theoretical developments , ohara s experimental group has studied a narrow resonance in @xmath16 , finding that the interaction energy and three - body recombination rate are both strongly energy dependent @xcite .",
    "this energy dependence can lead to novel many - body physics , such as breached - pair superfluidity @xcite .",
    "a similar experiment with @xmath17 mixtures has been performed by kohstall _",
    "they too study the rf spectrum near a narrow resonance , with extra complications due to the disparate masses and densities of the two species . here",
    "we restrict our discussion to the simpler homonuclear problem .",
    "qualitatively , their observations are very similar to ohara s . in this paper",
    ", we will calculate the rf spectrum of @xmath16 atoms near the narrow resonance around 543 g . as in the experiment of hazlett _",
    "_ , we consider the system initially in the lowest and third lowest hyperfine state ( defined as 1 and 3 ) . the feshbach resonance does not couple these atoms , and the system",
    "is readily modeled as non - interacting .",
    "rf waves will induce a transition between 3 and the second lowest hyperfine state ( defined as 2 ) .",
    "the shape of the absorption line will be modified by the interactions between atoms in state 1 and 2 .",
    "consequently the absorption spectrum will have strong dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "one hopes to use details of the rf lineshape to learn about the underlying physics @xcite .",
    "this program is analogous to how the tunneling spectra in superconductors can reveal features of the phonon pairing potential @xcite .    to calculate the lineshape we sum an infinite set of diagrams , restricting ourselves to intermediate states without particle - hole excitations .",
    "similarly we do not include the inelastic decay of the excited feshbach molecules .",
    "these latter processes should slightly broaden the spectrum .",
    "this approach yields relatively simple results , and obeys all of the appropriate sum rules . including more complicated intermediate states",
    "will quantitatively change the detailed lineshape , leaving gross features ( such as its first few moments ) unchanged .    through out this paper we restrict ourselves to a uniform gas whose density corresponds to the average density of the experimental harmonically trapped system .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment would include inhomogeneous broadening from the trap @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we first introduce the two channel resonance model which describes the system .",
    "then we give a simple sum rule argument to extract generic features of the rf lineshape as one changes the resonance width .",
    "next we calculate the rf spectrum from a @xmath18 variational ansatz .",
    "next we generalize our calculation to finite temperature using matsubara green s function techniques .",
    "finally , we compare our results with experiments .",
    "to describe the 3-component fermions near a narrow feshbach resonance , we use the following two channel resonance model @xcite @xmath19 where the first term in the hamiltonian corresponds to the energy of isolated atoms : @xmath20 annihilates an atom with momentum @xmath4 and spin @xmath21 , whose energy is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the chemical potential .",
    "the second term corresponds to the energy of isolated molecules , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the detuning between the open and closed channel , where @xmath26 is the magnetic moment difference between open and closed channel in @xmath27li with @xmath28 the bohr magneton .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian @xmath29 parameterizes the coupling between open and closed channels via a single coefficient @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the volume of the system . to second order in @xmath30 ,",
    "the two - body t - matrix describing scattering between states 1 and 2 is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the energy of one particle before scattering .",
    "thus the s - wave scattering length of the system is @xmath34 which can be compared with the empirical magnetic field dependence @xmath35 .",
    "hence @xmath30 is related to the experimental observables via @xmath36    as introduced in section i , the spin states @xmath21 model the three lowest energy hyperfine states of @xmath16 near the narrow feshbach resonance at @xmath37 . inserting known experimental parameters for @xmath0 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 the bohr radius , we find @xmath40 .",
    "the effective range of the model is @xmath41 . for a uniform gas of @xmath0 gas with density @xmath42 , the fermi wave vector @xmath43 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath44 , corresponding to a narrow resonance .    at time @xmath45",
    ", we imagine the system is prepared with an equal number of particles in states 1 and 3 , @xmath46 , and no particles in state 2 , @xmath47 . within our model , interactions vanish for this initial state .",
    "to investigate the narrow resonance between states 1 and 2 , we introduce a radio frequency probe which drives atoms from state 3 into state 2 .",
    "this probe can be modeled by a perturbation @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the physical radio waves have frequency @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the free - space resonance frequency for the transition from state 3 to 2 . for simplicity , we use units where @xmath52 and denote @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "thus in our model @xmath55 .      at zero temperature , the ground state of our system ( in the absence of the probe ) is a fermi sea of equal numbers of @xmath56 and @xmath57 particles @xmath58 .",

    ", we imagine a bimodal distribution made up from two @xmath74-function peaks , @xmath75 note : this ansatz does not capture the fact that the peaks may be quite broad and asymmetric .",

    "additionally , for @xmath97 , the coefficients simplify @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and there is effectively only a single peak , with @xmath100 . on the other hand , in the narrow resonance limit , @xmath101 , the peaks have nearly equal weight and",
    "disperse slowly as a function of the scattering length .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrules ] become flatter as the resonance width decreases .    in summary ,",
    "the sum rules suggest the following :    * in the limit of a wide resonance , the spectrum is dominated by a single peak whose mean frequency @xmath102 , and @xmath103 as @xmath104 . * for a finite width resonance this divergence is cut off . *",
    "generically , the spectrum will be bimodal near resonance . *",
    "the location of the resonance , defined by when equal spectral weight lies in each peak , is shifted from its free - space value .",
    "the divergence in ( 1 ) is a manifestation of the similar divergence seen in sum rule calculations of the mean line - shift in the rf - absorption from a superfluid initial state to a noninteracting final state @xcite .",
    "it should be interpreted as a divergence of the first moment of the spectral line , rather than the location of the peak .    beyond these generalities ,",
    "the sum rule arguments do not tell us about the detailed lineshapes . in the following subsections we present more sophisticated arguments to access these details .",
    "we will find that near resonance the peaks become quite broad , with spectral width growing as the temperature increases .      in the following subsections ,",
    "we give a quantitative description of the rf spectrum .",

    "the state @xmath108 represents the situation where the atom in spin - state 3 with momentum @xmath109 , has been transferred into spin - state 2 .",
    "this atom can bind with an atom in spin - state 1 with momentum @xmath110 , forming a molecule with momentum @xmath111 , described by state @xmath112 .",
    "we neglect possible intermediate states where this molecule then breaks up into a pair of atoms with momentum @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "these latter states look similar to @xmath108 , but have extra particle - hole excitations . in the limit @xmath115 ,",
    "such processes are suppressed relative to the terms we keep .",
