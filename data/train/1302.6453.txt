    "the most studied mechanisms to day are : the effect of neo - classical equilibrium flows @xcite , the exb shear @xcite and some form of radial profile shearing @xcite .",
    "the latter two mechanisms introduce an inhomogeneity in the radial direction .    in this paper a new mechanism of toroidal momentum transport",

    "the mechanism is connected with higher order , in the normalised larmor radius @xmath0 , parallel derivatives of the perturbed distribution as well as the perturbed fields . for micro - instabilities ,",
    "the perturbed quantities have scale lengths perpendicular to the magnetic field that are of the order of the larmor radius .",
    "the fast transport along the magnetic field , however , strongly damps short scale perturbations , and the scale length along the magnetic field is of the order of the system size ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this ordering allows some parallel derivatives that appear in the model equations to be neglected since they are one order smaller in the normalised larmor radius ( @xmath0 ) compared with the perpendicular gradients .",
    "the neglected terms , however , do break the parity symmetry and might , despite their smallness , be of relevance in the description of momentum transport . in this paper the effect of these parallel derivatives on momentum transport is studied .",

    "the physics mechanism is discussed below using an analytic model .",
    "we stress that this model does not include all contributions to the momentum flux obtained in the model that is developed in the next section .",

    "( [ model1]-[model6 ] ) is kept ) , in agreement with the assumptions made in the analytic model . comparing the curves",
    "it can be seen that the agreement is reasonable , though not perfect . this verifies that the analytic model gives a reasonable estimate of the effect .",
    "numerical simulation is nevertheless necessary if accuracy is required .    in this paper",
    "we consider two contributions to the momentum flux only : the diagonal ( diffusive ) contribution and the flux due to the finite @xmath0 terms . as discussed in the previous section , due to the smallness of @xmath0",
    ", one can expect the various mechanisms to generate a momentum flux that is linear in @xmath0 .",
    "the equation for the momentum flux may then be written in the form [ eq : gamma_linear ] _ ^= _ u^+ c _ * where @xmath133 .",
    "the first term in the equation above is the momentum diffusivity which has been studied in several papers @xcite . in the absence of an external torque",
    ", the momentum flux due to the finite @xmath0 parallel derivatives will modify the rotation profile , until this flux is balanced by the diffusive momentum flux , and @xmath134 .",
    "the equilibrium toroidal rotation gradient then is u^_eq = - c _ _ * the equation above provides a useful alternative to express the magnitude of the finite @xmath0 momentum flux , as it more clearly indicates its impact on the rotation profile .     as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the letters on the right relate to the symmetry breaking mechanism identified in eq .",
    "( [ model1]-[model6 ] ) a : red line with symbol + , b@xmath135 : light blue line with symbol * , b@xmath136 : dark green with symbol @xmath137 , d : black line with symbol @xmath132 , e : magenta line with symbol @xmath131. additionally the sum of all individual contributions is given by the ( green ) curve with the symbol o , and the momentum flux calculated including all finite @xmath0 terms is given by the ( blue ) curve with symbol x. the @xmath0 axis contains typical values of three machines : iter , aug and tcv . ]",
    "not only the flux due to the finite @xmath0 terms can be expected to be linear in @xmath0 , the smallness of @xmath0 also suggests that the various effects are additive .",
    "both these properties are shown in fig .  [ sum ] , which gives @xmath138 as a function of @xmath0 for each of the mechanisms discussed in the previous section , as well as the sum of all these separate contributions and the momentum flux calculated including all mechanisms .",
    "it can be seen that the flux due to all mechanisms is nearly perfect linear in @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath139 the momentum flux calculated including all mechanisms is 1%(5% ) smaller than the sum of the contributions calculated for each of the mechanisms separately . the various symmetry breaking mechanisms",
    "therefore do not have a strong interaction .",
    "the finite @xmath0 terms only have a small influence on the growth rate of the instability and the quasi - linear ion heat flux . for @xmath139 the growth rate increases by @xmath140 and the ion heat flux decreases by 0.9%(3% ) .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the largest contribution to the momentum transport is the fluctuating exb velocity in the background gradient , i.e.  the mechanism that was investigated in the introduction through an analytic model .",
    "furthermore , @xmath141 for the results shown in fig .",
    "[ potential ] , in reasonable agreement ( but larger than ) the analytic estimate @xmath142 ( using @xmath143 ) .",
    "the effect of the drift in the perturbed distribution on the momentum flux , as well as the corrections to the gyro - average and the calculation of the flux are smaller , though non - negligible , compared with the effect of the exb velocity . for the parameters used in the simulations the sum of all effects is close to the contribution of the exb velocity , due to a cancellation of the other contributions .",
    "this is , however , a coincidence for this particular set of parameters .",
    "[ parameter ] shows the momentum transport for different plasma parameters ( with @xmath144 ) .",
    "for all parameters the momentum transport due to the @xmath0 terms leads to a negative @xmath138 as predicted by eq .  .",
    "assuming the rotation at the plasma edge is zero , a counter - current rotation is then generated in the core .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath138 increases with decreasing @xmath55 , in agreement with the prediction of the analytic model .",
    "also the increase with decreasing @xmath56 predicted by this equation is found at sufficiently large @xmath56 .",
    "below @xmath48 however , the magnitude of the flux decreases with decreasing @xmath145 .",
    "because also @xmath146 decreases @xcite this represents a strong decrease in the momentum flux due to the finite @xmath0 terms .",
    "this decrease in the flux might be related to a larger extension of the mode along the surface ( i.e. a larger @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ uprim_analytic ] ) ) , but the exact interpretation is at present unknown .",
    "the increase of the momentum flux with safety factor and magnetic shear can be understood through a stronger localisation of the mode ( smaller @xmath46 ) . for the lowest @xmath55",
    ", no data of @xmath138 is shown for the highest values of the magnetic shear , because at higher shear the dominant instability is the off - axis itg @xcite ( this mode also sets in for @xmath147 ) . in the lowest order local limit",
    "two modes exist ( one shifted towards positive @xmath69 and one towards negative @xmath69 ) that have equal growth rates , and drive an equally large momentum flux in the opposite direction resulting in a zero momentum flux on average . even a small symmetry breaking results in one of these modes to be more unstable than the other .",
    "the time integration projects out only the most unstable mode that than drives a large momentum flux which magnitude no longer depends on the magnitude of the symmetry breaking term .",
    "this case is interesting , but beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in this paper the effect of finite @xmath0 terms on the toroidal momentum transport is investigated .",
    "essentially , higher order @xmath0 terms connected with the derivative towards the parallel coordinate @xmath69 have been investigated . in the ballooning representation ,",
    "these are the terms connected with the derivative of the ballooning envelope , rather than the eikonal . the model equations studied in this paper are homogeneous in the radial direction .",
    "finite @xmath0 effects due to the radial profiles are , therefore , not included .",
    "this paper discusses only the quasi - linear theory , and assumes an adiabatic electron response .",
    "clearly , further study is required to assess the magnitude of the effect under experimentally relevant conditions .",
    "although the momentum is mainly carried by the ions , kinetic electrons as well as finite beta effects have in the past been found to have a significant impact on the momentum flux @xcite . from the analytic model",
    "one might , for instance , expect that the result is sensitive to the extension of the mode along the field line .",
    "finally , only non - linear simulations can accurately determine the momentum fluxes .",
    "these studies are left to future work .",
    "h - mode plasmas have been reported to rotate mostly in the co - current direction @xcite , but it appears that both co- and counter current rotation can occur if the plasma edge does not rotate strongly@xcite .",
    "experimentally , a transition from co- to counter current rotation is then observed when the density ( or density gradient ) exceeds a threshold value @xcite . in our model",
    "the momentum flux due to the higher order parallel derivatives is directed such that the plasma core will rotate more strongly in the counter - current direction .",
