    "the casimir effect is a manifestation of the quantum nature of fields .",
    "the presence of physical boundaries gives rise to changes in the zero point energy of a quantum field @xcite .",
    "this has been studied theoretically for a number of geometries @xcite , however , apart from fairly simple cases such as parallel plates , spheres and cylinders , exact results are difficult to find because analytic solutions to the field equations are required .",
    "the possibility of technological applications of quantum vacuum fluctuations @xcite has made further investigation of the casimir effect in situations where the boundaries are either not perfectly conducting or of lower symmetry timely .",
    "the problem of the casimir self - stress on a spherical shell was first proposed by casimir @xcite as a possible mechanism for stabilizing a semiclassical model of the electron .",
    "however , boyer showed @xcite that the zero point energy is positive in this case . while the concept of the zero point energy of a single object must be carefully defined to avoid ambiguity , this notion has been applied to kaluza - klein theories @xcite and cosmological models , for example in @xcite .",
    "another area where the idea of the zero - point energy of a single object has found application is in hadronic physics .",
    "there have been many papers on the zero - point energy of coloured fields confined in a spherical cavity following the early work of bender and hays @xcite and milton @xcite .",
    "also , zero - point energy concepts have been applied to soliton @xcite , hybrid bag @xcite and string models @xcite of hadrons .    in recent years",
    "there has also been experimental and theoretical progress on the casimir force between separated objects .",
    "we refer the reader to review articles by lamoreaux @xcite , milton @xcite and klimchitskaya , mohideen and mostepanenko@xcite .",
    "of particular note is the recent experimental finding @xcite that the casimir or , more properly , the casimir - lifshitz force can be repulsive , confirming a prediction of lifshitz and collaborators @xcite for a system where the two plates have different dielectric permittivities and the vacuum is replaced by a liquid with a permittivity whose value is between those of the plates .",
    "it is well known that the casimir energy is sensitive to geometry - even the sign of the energy is difficult to predict .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to investigate the modification of zero point energy when the boundary is modified .",
    "experimental investigations @xcite have shown that changing the boundary on the nanometre scale alters the casimir - lifshitz force by a factor different from that predicted using the proximity force approximation , though more sophisticated calculations @xcite can account for the change in the force .",
    "recent work @xcite has provided experimental confirmation of an exact theoretical calculation of the effect of varying the amplitude of a sinusoidally corrugated surface .",
    "kitson and romeo @xcite looked at the theoretical problem of an infinite cylinder deformed from circular to elliptical cross - section . for small ellipticity ( or eccentricity ) @xmath0 a perturbative - like expansion for the zero point energy can be found : _",
    "c(a , e ) = e_c(a , 0 ) where @xmath1 is the semi - major axis of the ellipse , and @xmath2 is the regularized zero point energy per unit length of an infinite circular cylinder of radius @xmath1 , which has the numerical value @xcite _ c(0 ) - .",
    "this agrees with earlier work of kvitsinsky @xcite . noting that an ellipse with semi - major axis @xmath1 and ellipticity @xmath0 has area @xmath3 , kitson and romeo s result can be written in terms of @xmath4 , the geometric mean of the semi - major and semi - minor axes @xmath5 ( e ) - ,",
    "that is , if the cross - section of the cylinder remains constant under the deformation of the cross section from a circle of radius @xmath4 to an ellipse , then the zero point energy per unit length does not change , up to @xmath6 .",
    "this is a remarkable result , and begs the question whether it can be generalized to other deformations of highly symmetric boundaries .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the deformation of a sphere to a spheroid .",
    "it is known that the zero point energy for a spherical boundary is positive @xcite , whereas it is negative in the cases of parallel plates and infinite circular and elliptical cylinder geometries . as these geometries are limiting cases of spheroidal geometry , it is interesting to investigate the change in zero point energy as a sphere is deformed into a spheroid , and to see whether this change lowers or increases the zero point energy",
    ". some care may be needed here , as while the parallel plate configuration is the limiting case of an oblate spheroid with ellipticity taken to unity , there is also a change in topology , so the value of a physical quantity such as the zero point energy may not be continuous in this limit .",
    "it should be recognized that the situation we are discussing is an idealization where boundary conditions have replaced a physical interaction , and care needs to be taken , especially with the appearance of divergences . an alternative approach is to replace the boundary with a renormalizable coupling between the fluctuating field and a non - dynamical smooth background field @xcite .",
    "this approach allows the use of the standard renormalization procedure of quantum field theory without boundaries to obtain finite results .    in section 2 we consider the case of a massless scalar field subject to dirichelet and neumann boundary conditions on the surface of a prolate spheroid",
    "we obtain the zero point energy as a perturbative expansion in the ellipticity . in section 3",
    "we study the maxwell equations with perfect conductor boundary conditions on the surface of a spheroid .",
    "unfortunately an analytic solution for the fields is not possible in this case . in previous work @xcite",
    ", we proposed using a zonal approximation by weighting components of the known axial symmetric field solutions with a spheroidal boundary .",
    "however , we will show that this approximation is poor , and likely to give the wrong sign for the first correction term in the perturbative expansion of the zero point energy . in section 4",
    "we examine the implications of our results for the mit bag and flux tube models of hadron structure in qcd .",

    "we can model this as a spherical bag being deformed to a prolate spheroid with the semi - minor axis @xmath7 staying approximately constant . using the modified green s function result above , we have the zero point energy of the spheroid ~- ( 1 + e^2 + o(e^4 ) ) .",
    "now the semi - minor and semi - major axes of the spheroid are related by @xmath86 , so the zero point energy becomes ( e ) ~- ( 1 - e^2 + o(e^4 ) ) , so increasing the ellipticity will increase the energy of the bag .",
    "we can also consider a baryon ( three quark ) state . at small inter - quark separations ,",
    "the quarks sit in a spherical bag .",
    "lattice qcd simulations @xcite show that when one quark is separated from the other two a flux tube is formed , similar to the quark -antiquark case , with the flux tube again having approximately the same radius as the original bag .",
    "we can model this as a spherical bag being deformed to an oblate spheroid with constant semi - minor axis @xmath1 .",
    "the zero point energy of the oblate spheroidal bag using the modified green s function result is ~- ( 1 - e^2 + o(e^4 ) ) where @xmath50 is the ellipticity of the oblate spheroid .",
    "again we see that increasing the ellipticity increases the energy of the bag .",
    "these results are consistent with the flux tube model result that the flux tube has constant energy per unit length .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the zero point energy of a spheroid . for a massless scalar field ,",
    "subject to either dirichelet or neumann boundary conditions on the boundary of the spheroid , we were able to make an expansion in the ellipticity around @xmath87 and find the lowest order correction term for deviations from a perfect sphere .",
    "we used both zeta function and green s function methods to obtain the lowest order correction , and both methods agree .",
    "our result is consistent with the boundary deformation conjecture of kitson and romeo @xcite , first seen in the case of an elliptical cylinder . in this case",
    ", the boundary deformation conjecture says that the zero point energy of a sphere does not change , up to @xmath6 , when the sphere is deformed to a spheroid . in the case of a massless vector field ( or electromagnetism )",
    ", we were able to show that the zonal approximation we had previously used to calculate the zero point energy @xcite is likely to be incorrect , and we argued that there are good reasons for believing that the boundary deformation conjecture should apply in this case , even if an exact solution is not possible .",
    "finally , we applied the boundary deformation conjecture to the mit bag model , where we argued that zero point energy should increase when the bag is deformed from a sphere .",
    "it is tempting to relate the boundary deformation conjecture to the results of ambjrn and wolfram @xcite for a cubiodal box boundary .",
    "however , the results for the cuboid are only calculated for the field on the interior of the boundary , and are thus both divergent and dependent on the renomalization method used ( zeta function regularization in this case ) , whereas our result for the spheroid ( and the result of kitson and romeo for the elliptic cylinder geometry ) includes both internal and external fields and is finite ( as the divergences cancel ) and unambiguous .",
    "the finite part of ambjrn and wolfram s result shows that the sign of the zero point energy can change as the box is deformed , so it would be of considerable interest if their calculation could be extended to the external field , which would allow an unambiguous result .",
    "it would also be of interest to extend the work of this paper to spinor fields and fields with mass .",
    "finally , the @xmath6 corrections in the ellipticity expansion should be calculated to enable us to place better limits on the boundary deformation conjecture .",
    "we would like to thank a. romeo and k. a. milton for useful discussions , and b. van brunt for help with mathematical details . financial support from massey university and the royal society of new zealand are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the scalar helmholtz equation is separable in prolate spheroidal and oblate spheroidal coordinates . as oblate spheroidal functions are easily related to prolate spheroidal functions @xcite , we shall only consider prolate spheroidal functions .",
