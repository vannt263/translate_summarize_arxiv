    "self - organized collective dynamics is ubiquitous in the living world and emerges at all possible scales , from cell assemblies@xcite to animal groups@xcite .",
    "collective motion happens when thousands of moving individual entities coordinate with each other through local interactions such as attraction and alignment . as a result ,",
    "large - scale structures of typical sizes exceeding the inter - individual distances by several orders of magnitude are formed .",
    "one of the key questions is to understand how these self - organized structures spontaneously emerge from local interactions without the intervention of any leader . with this aim , individual - based models ( ibm ) , i.e. models that describe",
    "the behavior of each individual agent have been investigated@xcite .",
    "they consist of large systems of ordinary or stochastic differential equations the numerical resolution of which is computationally intensive . to describe large - scale structures coarse - grained models such as fluid models ( fm ) are needed .",
    "fm describe the dynamics of average quantities such as the mean density or mean velocity of the individuals@xcite .",
    "attempts to derive fm from ibm of collective motion can be found in @xcite .",
    "an intermediate step in the hierarchy of models consist of kinetic models ( km)@xcite which are partial differential equations ( pde ) describing the evolution of the probability density of the particles in phase - space .",
    "fm can be obtained as singular limits of the km under the hypothesis that the individual scales are much smaller than the system scales .",
    "this pde - based derivation of fm is referred to as the hydrodynamic limit.    in @xcite , the hydrodynamic limit of the vicsek ibm@xcite has been performed using an intermediate kinetic description@xcite .",
    "the vicsek ibm describes a noisy system of self - propelled particles interacting through local alignment . in @xcite , it has been shown that the absence of conservation laws ( such as momentum conservation ) resulting from self - propulsion can be overcome by introducing the new `` generalized collision invariant '' concept .",
    "the resulting model , referred to as the `` self - organized hydrodynamics ( soh ) '' is written : @xmath0 + \\theta \\mathcal{p}_{\\omega^\\perp}\\nabla\\rho   = 0,\\label{model08 - 2}\\\\ & & |\\omega| = 1\\label{model08 - 3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the density and the orientation of the mean velocity of the particles , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are given parameters , and @xmath6 is the spatial dimension .",
    "we let @xmath7 be the projection matrix onto the plane orthogonal to @xmath8 .",

    "( [ model08 - 2 ] ) describes how the velocity orientation evolves under transport by the flow ( the second term ) and the pressure gradient ( the third term , where @xmath9 is related to the noise in the underlying ibm and has the interpretation of a temperature )",
    ". however , there are important differences , which arise from the fact the @xmath8 is not a true velocity but the velocity direction , i.e. it is a vector of unit norm ( which is expressed by ( [ model08 - 3 ] ) ) . to preserve this geometrical constraint",
    ", the pressure gradient has to be projected onto the normal to @xmath8 , which is the reason for the presence of @xmath10 .",
    "other differences stem from the allowed discrepancy between the two constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "while @xmath11 fixes the material velocity to @xmath13 , the constant @xmath12 describes how @xmath8 is transported .",
    "this discrepancy originates from the lack of galilean invariance of the underlying ibm , itself resulting from self - propulsion@xcite .",
    "this model has been extended into several directions@xcite and a rigorous existence result is established in @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of the soh model in an annular domain .",
    "annular geometries allow for simple observations of symmetry - breaking transitions induced by collective motion .",
    "when a transition from disordered to collective motion occurs , the system is set into a collective rotation in either clockwise or counter - clockwise directions .",
    "annular geometries are a traditional design for salmon cages in sea farms@xcite and for experiments with locusts@xcite , pedestrians@xcite or sperm - cell dynamics@xcite . in all these examples , a polarized motion in one direction is observed . in the sperm - cell experiments ,",
    "the observation of turbulent structures that superimpose to collective rotation motivates the present work . in pure semen",
    ", sperm - cells are mostly interacting through volume exclusion . but",
    "volume exclusion interactions of rod - like self - propelled particles result in alignment@xcite .",
    "this legitimates the use of the vicsek model@xcite and of its fluid counterpart , the soh model@xcite , as models of collective sperm - cell dynamics .",
    "the vicsek model in annular geometry has been shown to exhibit polarized motion in @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on the soh model and study its normal modes in annular geometry in both the linear and nonlinear regimes .",
    "we first study the linear modes of the soh model around a perfectly polarized steady - state in sec .",
    "[ secss ] .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is that these modes are pure imaginary ( and thus , stable ) and form a countable set . in sec .",
    "[ secssnum ] , we compute the eigenmodes and eigenfunctions numerically and investigate how the eigenmodes depend on the geometry of the annulus and on the parameters of the model .",
    "we then turn towards the nonlinear model with the aims of ( i ) validating the linear analysis for small perturbations , ( ii ) investigating how the nonlinearity of the model affects the modal decomposition of the solution and ( iii ) demonstrating the capabilities of the modal decomposition to analyze the complex features of the nonlinear model . in future work",
