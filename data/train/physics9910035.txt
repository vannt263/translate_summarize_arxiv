    "first of all , the natural choice of @xmath48 is not the constant function because a reparametrization @xmath49 will transform @xmath48 into@xmath50 unless the transformation is linear , it turns a uniform distribution into a non - uniform one .",

    "the usual formula @xmath64 for the entropy is of too restricted validity in the present context , because this expression is not invariant under a reparametrization @xmath65 .",
    "the general expression for the entropy is @xmath66 which is independent of a reparametrization @xcite , because the transformations of both distributions , @xmath60 and @xmath45 , are performed according to ( [ 12a ] ) .",

    "it is @xmath75 and was proposed by jeffreys @xcite even before form invariance was discussed .",
    "not every conditional distribution @xmath38 possesses a symmetry ( [ 14a ] ) .",
    "even if this is not the case , expression ( [ 15a ] ) ensures that @xmath69 is approximately independent of the true value of @xmath33 .",
    "this holds in the following sense : for every @xmath53 one can replace the correct distribution @xmath76 by an approximation @xmath77 which is form invariant .",
    "the approximate and the correct distributions agree within the fourth order of @xmath78 . equation ( [ 15a ] ) yields the invariant measure of the approximation to within the third order of @xmath78 @xcite .    in summary :",

    "therefore ( [ 15a ] ) is the best recommendation in any case .",
    "neither the group theoretic argument nor jeffreys rule nor information theoretic arguments are new in the discussion of the bayesian prior .",
    "however , the way in which they are related justifies the present digression on a fundamental issue .",
    "we omit to show how and why the present arguments are related to the geometric considerations which were introduced by amari @xcite and are currently put forward by rodriguez @xcite .",
    "these authors agree on the result ( [ 15a ] ) .",
    "the posterior distribution @xmath60 is used to construct an interval of error often called a confidence interval .",

    "the posterior distribution @xmath60 approaches a gaussian for @xmath81 provided that the true value of @xmath33 is not on the border of the domain of definition of @xmath33 .",
    "one can prove that the variance of the gaussian is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "hence , with increasing @xmath63 the posterior distribution @xmath60 will become so narrow that @xmath45 changes very little in the domain where @xmath60 is essentially different from zero .",
    "note that @xmath45 does not depend on @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath45 drops out of expression ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "if this happens , the present bayesian analysis becomes equivalent to a @xmath83 fit of @xmath84 to the experimental points @xmath17 .",
    "the standard procedure of the @xmath83 fit can e.g.  be found in @xcite . it does not require a prior distribution .",
    "if @xmath60 is not gaussian , the @xmath83 fit yields meaningless confidence intervals .",
    "then bayesian inference can not be bypassed . in the example",
    "presented below this happens in the limit of small coupling between the resonators : eventually , the posterior distribution @xmath60 decreases monotonically .",
    "the experiment is then compatible with zero coupling because the shortest confidence interval contains the point @xmath85 for any @xmath79 .",
    "the point of zero coupling is on the border of the domain of definition of @xmath33 .",
    "spectral fluctuation properties can only be studied after secular variations of the level density have been removed , i.e.  after the frequency scale has been transformed such that the level density becomes unity within the interval covered by the experiment .",

    "the bayesian procedure outlined in the previous section requires that one assigns a probability distribution @xmath91 to each event .",
    "the @xmath34 are statistical quantities in the following sense : if another spectrum would be provided that had the same statistical properties as the measured one and the data @xmath34 would be constructed in the same way as above , they would of course not coincide with the data obtained from the actually measured spectrum  precisely because the levels are subject to statistical fluctuations .",
    "if one could go through the ensemble of spectra in this way , one would obtain an ensemble of data @xmath34 .",
    "we are looking for the distribution @xmath36 of this ensemble .",
    "since there is only the single measured spectrum and since no theory yielding @xmath36 is available , we have generated the distribution of @xmath34 by efron s bootstrap method @xcite .",
    "this method generates the distribution numerically by drawing at random and independently a new set of @xmath92 intervals from the @xmath92 original intervals .",
    "a new @xmath34 is produced from this new set of intervals . repeating this many times ,",
    "a distribution of @xmath34 is generated which is identified with the distribution @xmath36 of the @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath92 is always large , namely @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath94 , the distribution @xmath36 was in this way found to be a @xmath83 distribution with @xmath92 degrees of freedom  which intuitively seems reasonable .",

    "the strongest coupling treated in the present paper causes about 25% mixing between the two classes of levels , i.e.  a state which can be approximately assigned to the ( @xmath134 ) stadium contains about 25% strength from the configurations of the ( @xmath135 ) stadium  and vice versa .",
