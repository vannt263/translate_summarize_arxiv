    "it is well - known that certain statistical functionals such as moments fail to be weakly continuous on the set of , say , all probability measures on the real line for which these functionals are well - defined .",

    "this fact was pointed out by bahadur and savage ( 1956 ) .",
    "donoho ( 1988 ) extended these considerations by noting that many functionals of interest are at least weakly semi - continuous , so that one - sided confidence bounds are possible .",

    "on the other hand , when asking a statistician to draw a typical probability density , she or he will often sketch a bell - shaped , maybe skew density . a natural question is whether statistical functionals such as moments become weakly continuous if attention is restricted to a natural nonparametric class of distributions with unimodal densities .",
