    "in reaction to changes in their environment , polymers often go through large - scale conformational changes akin to phase transitions , which are of significance to many biological processes .",
    "a simple homopolymer chain , for instance , collapses from an extended coil to a compact globule in response to changes in the solvent  @xcite .",
    "this transition is continuous and can be viewed as the single chain analogy of a second - order phase transition . in other cases ,",
    "the conformational change of the polymer occurs discontinuously in a first - order like transition , and distinct conformations can coexist with each other",
    ". such cooperative behavior , familiar from two - state protein folding , has been also observed in a single polymer chain with square - well interaction  @xcite .",
    "the complex phase behavior of the square - well chain has been investigated previously in a number of different studies .",
    "taylor and lipson  @xcite carried out analytical calculations on very small chains , and showed that the system s radius of gyration is a sigmoidal function of temperature .",
    "later , zhou  etal .",
    "@xcite performed simulations of longer chains showing that the increase in the polymer s dimensions with temperature is more pronounced for longer chains .",
    "more recently , taylor , paul and binder  @xcite mapped out the entire phase diagram as a function of temperature and width of the attractive well  @xcite . depending on the well width",
    ", one observes one of two phase transitions : a second - order coil - to - globule for wide wells , and a first - order coil - to - crystal transition .",
    "the authors also calculated the free energy as a function of the potential energy at coexistence . in the latter case a free energy barrier separating the two phases imposes a pronounced two - state behavior on the system  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we focus on clarifying the mechanism of the coil - to - crystal transition of the polymer . in order to perform molecular dynamics simulations and hence obtain a realistic picture of the transition event ,",
    "we have developed a continuous approximation to the pure square - well chain . using this model we performed transition path sampling ( tps ) simulations  @xcite to obtain reactive pathways taking the chain from the expanded to the folded configuration . to enhance the efficiency of our tps simulation",
    ", we devised a new shooting move where the topology of the polymer is altered prior to the actual shooting .",
    "we then calculated committor values for the configurations along the transition pathways and used this information as a basis for the search for a possible reaction coordinate based on the likelihood maximization method of peters and trout  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the transition state ensemble ( tse ) of the system indicates that the number of crystalline particles in a given configuration is a rather poor measure of the progress of the transition .",
    "similarly , the chain s radius of gyration does not convey any information about the folding transition .",

    ", the system has a discrete energy spectrum @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of square - well overlaps in the chain .",
    "as recently shown by taylor , paul and binder  @xcite , depending on the value of the potential width @xmath1 and temperature @xmath14 , there exist three different phases . at high temperatures ,",
    "the polymer is in the expanded coil phase for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "what happens if the system is cooled , however , depends on the width @xmath1 of the attractive well . for wide wells , upon cooling the chain",

    "this transition is of second order . further lowering the temperature then leads to a first - order phase transition to a crystalline state . for sufficiently narrow wells ( @xmath15 )",
    ", the system directly freezes from the expanded coil to the crystalline state in a first - order transition",
    ". snapshots of the coil state and the crystal state are depicted in fig.[fig : states ] .",
    "since we are interested in the mechanism of the coil - to - crystal transition , the procedure used to evolve the system along transition pathways must resemble the natural dynamics of the system .",
    "if monte carlo dynamics is considered , this implies that only local moves can be used .",
    "molecular dynamics provides a more physical ( and computationally more efficient ) way to model the time evolution of the system . to facilitate such simulations and avoid the cumbersome handling of impulsive forces caused by the discontinuities in the potential , we have developed a smooth ( differentiable ) version of the square - well potential .",
    "the smooth potential is defined as @xmath16 + \\tanh \\left [ \\frac{r-\\lambda \\sigma}{a } \\right ] - 1 \\right\\},\\ ] ] where we have chosen a value of @xmath17 for the parameter which determines the steepness of the exponential repulsion and the width of the step at @xmath18 .",

    "the harmonic spring potential ( acting between neighboring beads ) is also shown for comparison . ]",
    "in this section we provide a brief outline of the computational methods used to obtain the results discussed in sec.[sec : results ] .      in order to verify the equivalence of our smooth chain model with the square - well chain studied previously  @xcite , we have performed wang  landau simulations  @xcite . in the wang  landau algorithm , one iteratively obtains the density of states @xmath21 , from which all other thermodynamic properties follow .",
    "this is done by performing a monte carlo simulation with the inverse of the current estimate of the density of states as the weight of a configuration , instead of the usual boltzmann weight .",

    ".    one pass of the wang ",
    "landau simulation consists of @xmath23 single moves and contains , on average , @xmath24  pivot moves , @xmath24  end moves , @xmath25 crankshaft moves , @xmath26  bond - bridging moves and @xmath0 displacement moves . for the energy histogram @xmath27",
    ", we have used bins of unit width in an energy range of @xmath28 $ ] , which in order to speed up the computations is split into two overlapping energy ranges .",
    "the results are then averaged and joined at @xmath29 .",
    "the quality of the joint is checked by computing the numerical derivative of the density of states , which is found to agree well in the vicinity of @xmath30 .",
    "the histogram @xmath27 is checked every @xmath31 passes for flatness , and is considered flat if no bin deviates by more than 20% from the average .",
    "furthermore , as an alternative flatness criterion , we check for uniform growth of @xmath27 ( i.e. , each bin in the histogram has increased within a range of 20% of the average growth since the last check ) every @xmath32 passes . to keep the numbers within the range that can be handled by standard floating - point arithmetic , @xmath33 instead of @xmath21 is stored .",
    "our initial value of the density of states is @xmath34 for all @xmath35 , with an initial modification factor of @xmath36 .",
    "subsequent modification factors are chosen as @xmath37 .",
    "once the density of states is known , one can calculate the canonical partition function @xmath38 and the probability density of the energy , @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the inverse temperature . with that ,",
    "any quantity which is a function of the energy can be calculated , in particular the specific heat @xmath41 where @xmath42 for a finite system , maxima in @xmath43 are related to phase transitions or other structural rearrangements  @xcite .      in order to gain insight into the transition mechanism ,",
    "we have performed transition path sampling simulations for a temperature at which the coil and crystal coexist . at this particular temperature ,",
    "the equilibrium probability distribution of the energy is bimodal with two peaks of equal weight for the coil and crystallite , respectively . in between",
    ", the probability is extremely low , which corresponds to a high free energy barrier separating the two types of configurations .",
    "hence , in an equilibrium molecular dynamics or monte carlo simulation , one would practically never see a direct transition from the coil to the crystallite or vice versa .",
    "we overcome this time scale problem by using transition path sampling .",
    "in contrast to wang  landau sampling , tps is able to provide dynamical pathways taking the system from one state to another .",
    "our tps simulations use aimless shooting  @xcite and a flexible path length .",
    "we employ langevin dynamics with a time step @xmath44 and a damping constant @xmath45 , where the integration of the equation of motion is performed using the langevin thermostat by schneider and stoll  @xcite implemented in a modified version of lammps  @xcite .",
    "the distinction between the states @xmath46 ( expanded coil ) and @xmath47 ( frozen crystallite ) is made based on the potential energy of the system .",
    "a configuration is considered to be in the coil state if @xmath48 and it is considered to be in the crystalline state if @xmath49 .",
    "we check if one of these states is reached every @xmath50 time steps , which is also the time interval for saving the current snapshot along the path .",
    "the shooting point is selected with equal probability from @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath51 denotes the shooting point of the previous trajectory and @xmath54 .",
    "no restrictions are placed on the length of the pathways .",
    "a path is accepted if it is reactive , i.e. , @xmath55 or @xmath56 , and rejected if it is not .",
    "one major problem when performing a standard transition path sampling simulation of the polymer chain is that the decorrelation between subsequent pathways is very slow .",
    "in particular , subsequent pathways generated with the standard shooting move have almost identical crystalline cores in the transition state region .",
    "a solution of this problem is to modify the shooting point prior to each shooting move more than by just modifying the particle velocities . in particular , at each shooting point we perform a number of bond - bridging monte carlo moves  @xcite in addition to a random assignment of the particle velocities .",
    "this bond - bridging moves modify also the crystalline core , leading to a faster decorrelation of the pathways .    in order to maintain the equilibrium distribution of states ,",
    "the bond - bridging move has to be performed at the same temperature as the actual transition path sampling simulation . in this move ,",
    "one first chooses the first ( @xmath57 ) or last ( @xmath58 ) monomer of the polymer with equal probability .",
    "then , all interior monomers ( @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) within a distance of @xmath61 of the chosen end are identified .",
    "one of these monomers is chosen at random and then connected to monomer @xmath62 ( or @xmath0 ) via removal of monomer @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) and re - insertion between monomer @xmath9 and the selected end at a random azimuthal angle .",
    "the re - insertion is furthermore done such that none of the bonded distances changes .",
    "the move is then accepted with probability @xmath65 where the potential energy change @xmath66 stems only from the change in the potential for the non - neighboring sites , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the numbers of possible bridging partners in the initial and final state , and @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) is the distance between monomer @xmath9 and the selected end , with @xmath71 defined accordingly for the final state . a detailed description of the algorithm adapted to smooth bonding potentials is provided in appendix  [ ap : bond_bridging ] .",
    "it is worth noting that due to the bond - bridging moves carried out at the shooting point , the newly generated pathway does not intersect with the previous path at the shooting point .",
    "still , each individual path is continuous in both space and momentum .      in order to distinguish between coil - like and solid particles , we use",
    "the connection coefficients @xmath72 based on steinhardt bond order parameters  @xcite . for two particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 close to each other ( distance smaller than @xmath73 ) , the connection coefficient @xmath72 is defined as the scalar product of the complex @xmath74 vectors of particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 expressed in terms of spherical harmonics  @xcite . the scalar product measures the correlation between the local environments of particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we then define two adjacent particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 as _ connected _ if @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , let us denote the number of ( bonded and non - bonded ) neighbors and the number of connected neighbors of particle @xmath9 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "particle @xmath9 is defined as _ crystalline _ if @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this combination of two conditions ensures that surface particles with a reduced number of adjacent particles can be detected as crystalline . at the same time , particles deep within the core of the polymer are not incorrectly detected as crystalline if they belong to the compact , but unordered phase .",
    "in addition , a particle is defined as _ coil - like _ if @xmath80 regardless of the value of @xmath81 .",
    "we classify particles as _ intermediate _ if they are neither crystalline nor coil - like .      in order to investigate the effectiveness of the core - modification shooting move in generating new trajectories , we introduce a measure for the overlap between system configurations .",
    "the key idea is that two configurations are classified as similar if they share contacts between the same particles . here",
    ", we use the matrix of pair energies as a measure of contact . due to the shape of the pair potential ,",
    "typically the pair energies in units of @xmath82 are very close to @xmath83 ( in contact ) or @xmath84 ( not in contact ) . for two configurations , represented by contact matrices @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    ", we define the overlap as @xmath87 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 run over all monomers in the system .",
    "note that by taking the element - wise product of the matrices , only connections which are present in both configurations give a contribution to the overlap measure .",
    "also , the normalization corrects for the total number of contacts present and ensures that the overlap between two identical configurations is @xmath62 .",
    "taking this idea one step further , we define a correlation function , which measures the average overlap over a time series of configurations , for example the shooting points of a long tps simulation , @xmath88 here , the matrix @xmath89 is the deviation of the contact matrix at step @xmath13 from its average value and the product is meant in the sense of eq .. by definition , @xmath90 .      for a system with two ( meta- ) stable states",

    ", @xmath13 is the total number of observations , i.e. , the total number of shooting events entering in eq.([eq : lalpha ] ) , and @xmath96 is the number of free parameters entering the model .",
    "the bic penalizes models with too many free parameters , hence it is used to check whether it is sensible to add additional physical parameters to improve the model reaction coordinate .    to carry out the reaction",
    "coordinate analysis , we first calculate the committor for a number of states randomly selected from transition pathways .",
    "we then calculate a set of collective variables for each state . in order to obtain the optimal combination of collective variables , we first determine the single variable that maximizes the likelihood defined above .",
    "then , we maximize the likelihood for each 2-variable combination of the selected variable and all the remaining other variables . the procedure is repeated successively adding variables . combinations of up to 3  variables are considered .    for",
    "a perfect reaction coordinate @xmath106 all configurations with the same value of @xmath95 should have the same committor , @xmath107 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there should exists a value @xmath108 of the reaction coordinate such that all configurations with @xmath108 have a committor of @xmath109 , i.e. , they have equal likelihood to relax into state @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "these configurations are transition states and together they form the transition state ensemble ( tse ) . accordingly , the distribution of committor values for states with @xmath110 should be strongly peaked around a value of @xmath111 . for a perfect reaction coordinate ,",
    "the only deviation from @xmath112 is due to the statistical error that arises in computing the committor from a finite number of trajectories .",
    "therefore , the width of the peak around @xmath112 decreases with increasing number of trajectories used to calculate the committor for each configuration .",
    "in order to relate the freezing transition of the smooth polymer chain to that of the pure square - well chain , we first need to verify that its phase behavior is similar to that of the original model . hence , we have calculated the specific heat @xmath43 for both the original square - well chain as well as for its smooth variant using the density of states ( fig.[fig : ut ] ) obtained by wang  landau sampling .",
    "two important observations can be made .",
    "first , the overall structure of the two curves is almost identical , especially in the important region corresponding to the freezing transition . for the smooth model , however , the peak is shifted slightly to lower temperatures , and the whole curve has a higher value away from the peak .",
    "this can be explained by noting that the harmonic springs in the new model introduce additional degrees of freedom not present in the original polymer .",
    "therefore , the specific heat is increased , and the system needs a lower temperature for the freezing transition to occur . in fig.[fig : fepe ] , we have plotted the probability distribution of the energy and the free energy profile at the freezing temperature . the observed barrier height of roughly @xmath113 agrees well with the result from taylor  etal . for the pure square - well chain  @xcite .     for the square - well model and its smooth modification . for the smooth chain ,",

    "some examples of shooting point configurations obtained from a tps simulation are shown in fig.[fig : sp_comparison ] . even from visual inspection",
    "it is clear that the two configurations with a high overlap value share a practically identical crystalline core . for better visibility",

    "correlation functions for the shooting points as well as for the final folded states of the reactive pathways are shown .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the use of the core - modification prior to each shooting is vital to de - correlate the state within a reasonable amount of time .",
    "otherwise , even after 100 tps cycles , there is still a considerable amount of overlap between shooting points and even folded states . in other words , without core modification the simulation is stuck in a single class of similar folding pathways which all lead to final states with identical cores .",

    "it turns out that when one uses only one variable as a model reaction coordinate , @xmath130 gives the best likelihood ( see tab.[tab : likelihoodscores ] ) .",
    "furthermore , when including an additional variable and performing the optimization over both @xmath130 and the second variable , the use of the global order parameter @xmath3 gives the best improvement . the improvement is better than with the inclusion of @xmath135 , even though , for single variables , @xmath135 has a higher likelihood score .",
    "however , since the energy is dominated by the number of non - permanent bonds , and most bonds occur in the crystalline core , it is clear that @xmath130 and @xmath135 are highly correlated .",
    "therefore , @xmath135 can add only very little information that is not already present in @xmath130 , and consequently , the variable pair ( @xmath130 , @xmath122 ) gets a lower likelihood score than ( @xmath130 , @xmath3 ) . iterating the procedure one step further",
    ", we find that including the radius of gyration @xmath131 improves the likelihood the most .",
    "however , the relative improvement for a third variable is rather small , confirming our previous observation that the radius of gyration does not carry much information about the crystallization mechanism .",
    "furthermore , both the anisotropy @xmath137 of the configuration , with the moments of inertia @xmath138 and @xmath139 , as well as @xmath140 alone , give a very similar likelihood score when used as a third variable in the optimization . in order to test the robustness of the procedure , we have performed the optimization procedure for smaller subsets of the full data set of known committor values . while @xmath130 and @xmath3 are ranked first and second consistently , the third variable is often different for each run .",
    "for example , in one case @xmath141 , @xmath140 , and @xmath142 were equally well suited as a third variable , giving almost identical likelihood scores .",
    "this implies that a third variable in addition to the combination ( @xmath130,@xmath3 ) does not improve the quality of the optimized reaction coordinate in a significant way .",
    "the log likelihood scores for the full dataset are listed in table[tab : likelihoodscores ] .",
    "other collective variables considered in the optimization were the order parameters @xmath143 and @xmath3 evaluated for core ( @xmath144,@xmath145 ) and peripheral particles ( @xmath146,@xmath147 ) only , and the biggest eigenvalue @xmath148 of the contact matrix ( as used by rika and coworkers  @xcite ) .",
    "the contact or laplacian matrix is defined as @xmath149 in our work , we have actually used the matrix of pair energies instead , which is very similar to the above definition due to the shape of the pair potential . note that as observed by rika and coworkers previously , it makes little difference for the behavior of @xmath148 whether one uses the above definition for the diagonal elements of the matrix , or sets them to zero as it is the case when using the pair energies .",
    "the committor as a function of the optimal reaction coordinate constructed from @xmath130 , @xmath3 and @xmath131 is shown in fig.[fig : cpb_likelihood_exptanh ] .",
    "although this reaction coordinate yields the best likelihood score , there remains a considerable spread in the committor for any particular value of the reaction coordinate .    in fig.[fig :",
    "cpbhist ] , we have plotted the committor distribution for all states with a value of @xmath129 for the optimized reaction coordinate .",
    "for both the potential energy and the optimized rc , the distribution has a small trough around @xmath109 .",
    "since all states were selected at random , a likely explanation is that the system simply does not spend a long time at committor values around @xmath128 .",
    "if the proposed reaction coordinate is of poor quality , the committor distribution for the transition value of the rc will look similar to the unrestricted distribution , which also has a trough around @xmath128 .",
    "however , compared to the distribution for potential energy values of @xmath150 , for the optimized rc one sees a slight improvement because the width of the histogram has decreased due to the optimization , while the peak of the distribution is shifted towards a value of @xmath111 . in particular",
    ", gaussians fitted to the histograms have a mean of @xmath151 with a standard deviation of @xmath152 for the potential energy as reaction coordinate and a mean of @xmath153 and a standard deviation of @xmath154 for the optimized reaction coordinate .     as a function of the optimum reaction",
    "coordinate @xmath95 , which is a linear combination of the potential energy @xmath130 and the global order parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the red line is the model reaction coordinate of eq .. inset : committor as a function of @xmath130 alone . ]",
    "for sufficiently small interaction ranges @xmath1 , the square - well polymer chain shows a two - state folding transition from the extended coil directly to the crystalline state . using tps simulations with a new core modification move , which has proved crucial for the ergodic sampling of transition pathways ,",
    "we have studied the folding mechanism in detail .",
    "a committor analysis of the harvested transition pathways has confirmed the earlier observation that transition states have a single crystalline nucleus , while the rest of the system is still in a coil - like configuration . while the fully crystalline state and the coil state can be distinguished based on the total potential energy , which essentially counts the number of close contacts between monomers ,",
    "the energy is not well suited as reaction coordinate .",
    "the potential energy of transition states is distributed around @xmath155 , which also coincides with the maximum of the free energy curve at the transition temperature .",
    "however , the broad distribution of committor values at @xmath155 shows that the potential energy does not accurately quantify the progress of the crystallization transition . using the likelihood maximization method of peters and trout  @xcite , we have constructed an optimized reaction coordinate , which is a linear combination of the the potential energy and the global order parameter @xmath3 of the polymer .",
    "this optimized reaction coordinate captures the progress of the folding transition more accurately than the energy alone or any other combination of two variables we tested , indicating that variables describing the structure and the overall shape of the polymer are needed in order to understand the transition mechanism .",
    "however , the improvement of the reaction coordinate obtained by including @xmath3 is marginal .",
    "the question arises whether the optimum reaction coordinate identified for the specific model studied in this paper is transferable to other polymer models . in our model with short - range attractions and strongly repulsive cores , the potential energy works as order parameter because it is proportional to the number of contacts . in the case of polymers with additional contributions to the potential energy , such as torsional and angular potentials",
    ", it will be more appropriate to use the number of contacts directly rather than the potential energy .",
    "similarly , the order parameter @xmath3 is sensitive to a close - packed structure , which occurs in the crystalline state of the square - well chain . for more complex polymers ,",
    "it is likely that one will get better results when using an order parameter which is sensitive to the particular ground state structure of the system under consideration .",
    "an interesting aspect of of the transition has been noted recently by rika , quigley and allen  @xcite in forward flux sampling simulations of a slightly modified version of the chain allowing for the application of collision dynamics . they have analyzed the distribution of the largest eigenvalue @xmath148 of the polymer s laplacian matrix .",
    "this variable exhibits a different distribution depending on the folding probability .",
    "more specifically , folding pathways with a high folding probability , as well as unfolding pathways , show a bimodal distribution of @xmath148 , while the equilibrium distribution for the same temperature is unimodal .",
    "the second peak occurs at a higher value of @xmath148 , which also corresponds to configurations with an already ordered crystalline nucleus .",
    "while @xmath148 carries a signature characteristic for the two stable states , it does not convey much useful information about the progress of the transition .",
    "the features in the distribution of this variable  @xcite have a straightforward explanation : configurations which have a finite folding probability already need to have some degree of crystallinity , otherwise they will not fold even if their energy is rather low . in other words , while @xmath148 carries enough information to decide whether there is _ some _ or _ zero _ folding probability , the variable can not be used to make an accurate prediction of the actual committor value if it is anything other than zero , and , therefore , does not perform well as a reaction coordinate .",
    "we have confirmed this result even when we include several or even all eigenvalues of the contact matrix in the reaction coordinate approximation .",
    "a possible explanation is that even the full set of eigenvalues suffers from the same flaw as @xmath148 alone : similar to other global order parameters , they are only a measure of the overall crystallinity present in the system . by construction , they are completely symmetric under reordering of the particles . however , in a polymer chain , which has linked neighbors",
    ", the order of the monomers actually does matter , a fact that is completely neglected when using such measures of crystallinity .",
    "therefore , it remains a challenging task to construct better order parameters for homopolymers , which take into account the actual order along the chain , while still being symmetric under other operations , such as reversing the labeling without changing the connectivity .",
    "more elaborate machine learning approaches such as support vector machines may be helpful in this endeavor .",
    "we thank clemens moritz for suggesting the use of the bond - bridging move in tps simulations .",

    "the bond - bridging move used in our tps simulation works as follows .",
    "first , end particle @xmath62 or @xmath0 is chosen with equal probability . then",
    ", all interior monomers ( @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) within a distance of @xmath156 of the chosen end are identified , and one of these , denoted by @xmath9 , is chosen at random .",
    "this monomer is reconnected to the end via removal and re - insertion of the next chain neighbor in the direction of the end , namely particle @xmath63 or @xmath64 . a schematic view of this procedure is given in fig.[fig : state_a ] .",
    "the acceptance probability for the move is @xmath157.\\ ] ] here , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) stands for the number of possible bridging partners present in state @xmath142 ( @xmath158 ) and @xmath159 is the distance of monomer @xmath9 to the previously selected chain end , with @xmath71 defined accordingly .",
    "@xmath160 is the equilibrium distribution to be sampled . as usual ,",
    "the value of @xmath161 depends on the type of simulation that is performed : we have @xmath162 for a canonical ensemble at inverse temperature @xmath163 and @xmath164 in the case of a wang  landau simulation .",
    "as we will discuss in the following , particular care has to be taken in deriving the acceptance probability , because in our modified square - well polymer , bond lengths are allowed to fluctuate .",
    "the move is designed such that none of these distances are changed , in other words , the change in the potential energy from the harmonic springs is always zero .    in all the following , we will assume that particle @xmath62 has been selected as the end to be reconnected .",
    "the situation for end particle @xmath0 is of course identical , but @xmath63 has to be replaced by @xmath64 and @xmath165 by @xmath166  etc .",
    "let us also denote the distances to keep fixed with @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the chain is then re - connected as indicated in fig.[fig : bondbridging_distances ] .",
    "we have @xmath169 , and can calculate @xmath170 note that due to the variable bond lengths , it is possible that @xmath171 . in that case , there is no possibility to perform the re - connection , and the move is rejected .",

    ", @xmath128 arises from the fact that there are two ends to choose from and @xmath67 is the number of possible bridging partners present in state @xmath142 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath176 is the number of possible configurations for @xmath158 once the other choices have already been made .",
    "this number is proportional to the configuration space volume available for the choice of @xmath158 under the imposed constraints : @xmath177 . in order to estimate @xmath178 for the given geometry",
    ", we have to realize that a constraint on a distance is constructed using a delta function in the distribution function .",
    "in other words , @xmath179 actually means that @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is infinitesimal . in the case of our move ,",
    "the distances to be kept fixed are @xmath182 and @xmath183 . in fig.[fig : bondbridging_parallelogram ] , we have illustrated the geometry at the re - insertion point , with the parallel lines indicating the infinitesimal constraints .",
    "the available configuration space volume is proportional to the ( also infinitesimal ) cross section @xmath184 . since the azimuthal angle of the re - insertion is random , this has to be multiplied with the circumference of the circle defined by the rotation of the re - insertion point around the axis from @xmath62 to @xmath9 : @xmath185          the actual value for @xmath184 can be calculated by looking at the geometry at the re - insertion point ( fig.[fig : bondbridging_parallelogram ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath186 also , @xmath187 , therefore @xmath188 . to get an expression that only includes known distances , we first split the triangle defined by the positions of particles @xmath9 , @xmath63 and @xmath62 into two right triangles : @xmath189 . hence ,",
    "@xmath190 the sines and cosines can now be expressed as ratios of known lengths : @xmath191 putting all together , we get @xmath192 hence the generation probability is @xmath193 this implies @xmath194 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\hphantom{p_{\\text{acc}}(a \\rightarrow b ) } = \\min \\left[1 , \\frac{\\rho(b)}{\\rho(a ) } \\frac{b_a}{b_b } \\frac{r_b}{r_a } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this result holds regardless of whether @xmath195 or not .",
