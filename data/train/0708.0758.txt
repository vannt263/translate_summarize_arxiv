    "the collection @xmath1 of subgroups of direct products of free groups is surprisingly rich and has been studied by many authors . in the early 1960s stallings",
    "@xcite exhibited a subgroup of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the rank @xmath4 free group , as the first known example of a finitely presented group whose third integral homology group is not finitely generated .",
    "bieri @xcite demonstrated that stallings group belongs to a sequence of groups @xmath5 , the stallings - bieri groups , with @xmath6 being of type @xmath7 but not of type @xmath8 .",
    "( see @xcite for definitions and background concerning finiteness properties of groups . )    in the realm of decision theory , mihalova @xcite and miller @xcite exhibited a finitely generated subgroup of @xmath9 with undecidable conjugacy and membership problems .",
    "it is thus seen that even in the @xmath4-factor case fairly wild behaviour is encountered amongst the subgroups of direct products of free groups .",
    "in contrast to this , baumslag and roseblade @xcite showed that in the @xmath4-factor case this wildness only manifests itself amongst the subgroups which are not finitely presented .",
    "they proved that if @xmath10 is a finitely presented subgroup of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are free groups , then @xmath10 is itself virtually a direct product of at most @xmath4 free groups .",

    "they proved that if @xmath10 is a subgroup of a direct product of @xmath14 free groups and if @xmath10 enjoys the finiteness property @xmath8 , then @xmath10 is virtually a direct product of at most @xmath14 free groups .",
    "further information on the finiteness properties of the groups in class @xmath1 was provided by meinert @xcite who calculated the bns invariants of direct products of free groups .",
    "these invariants determine the finiteness properties of all subgroups lying above the commutator subgroup .",
    "several authors have investigated the isoperimetric behaviour of the finitely presented groups in @xmath1 .",
    "elder , riley , young and this author @xcite have shown that the dehn function of stallings group @xmath15 is quadratic .",
    "the method espoused by bridson in @xcite proves that the function @xmath16 is an upper bound on the dehn functions of each of the stallings - bieri groups .",
    "in contrast , there have been no results which give non - trivial lower bounds on the dehn functions of any groups in @xmath1 . in other words , until now there has been no finitely presented subgroup of a direct product of free groups whose dehn function was known to be greater than that of the ambient group . the purpose of this paper is to construct such a subgroup : we exhibit a finitely presented subgroup of @xmath2 whose dehn function has the function @xmath16 as a lower bound .",

    "we expect that the reader will already be familiar with these concepts ; the purpose of the exposition is principally to introduce notation . in section 3",
    "we define a class of subgroups of direct products of free groups of which @xmath17 is a member .",
    "the subsequent section gives finite generating sets for those groups in the class which are finitely generated and section 5 proves a splitting theorem which shows how certain groups in the class decompose as amalgamated products .",
    "we then prove in section 6 how , in certain circumstances , the distortion of the subgroup @xmath23 in an amalgamated product @xmath24 gives rise to a lower bound on the dehn function of @xmath25 .",
