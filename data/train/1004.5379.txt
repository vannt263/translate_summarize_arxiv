    "off - nuclear ultra  luminous x  ray sources ( ulxs ) have been found in different galaxies .",
    "it has been found that many of the ulxs are associated with active star  forming regions ( e.g.  in the antennae , @xcite ) , optical emission line nebulae ( e.g.  @xcite ) and radio halos ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , six off - nuclear sources with @xmath7 have been found ( i.e.  in the cartwheel galaxy , @xcite ; m  82  x-1 , @xcite and @xcite ; in ngc  2276 , @xcite ; eso  243 - 49 , @xcite ; in ngc  5775 , @xcite and m101  ulx-1 , @xcite ) .",
    "they are called hyper - luminous x - ray sources . the optical counterpart has been found and studied in only a sub - sample of these ( m101  ulx-1 , @xcite , @xcite ; eso  243 - 49 , @xcite ; and possibly m  82  x-1 , @xcite ) .",
    "an important question in the work on the ulxs is whether the emission is isotropic or not . if beaming is significant ( @xcite ) an intermediate  mass black hole ( imbh ) or super - massive black hole ( smbh ) is not needed to explain sources with luminosities up to @xmath8 . for several sources , ionizing luminosities derived from the optical emission lines and the resolved radio bubbles indicate that beaming is not important ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and hence these sources are good candidates for imbhs . for the sample of hyper - luminous ulxs",
    ", their x - ray luminosity seems too high for a stellar mass black hole even in the presence of some beaming . for their classification",
    "there are currently three possible scenarios : very bright type iin supernovae , imbhs and recoiling smbhs .",
    "we will briefly introduce these options .",
    "the x - ray brightest supernovae are of type iin ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in principle , they could be responsible for a sub - sample of the very bright ulxs .",
    "time variability in the x - ray as well as in the optical band can be used to constrain this possibility .    in the cold dark matter ( @xmath9 )",
    "cosmological scenario current ( z=0 ) galaxies are the product of hierarchical mergers of smaller galaxies .",
    "these smaller building blocks also host black holes in their centers ( ) . evidence for this comes from the observed m@xmath10 relation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . furthermore , several so called dual active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have been found ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "after a galaxy merger , the two black holes will eventually merge as well ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recent fully relativistic numerical simulations allow for the calculation of the linear angular momentum that is transported by gravitational wave radiation during the final plunge in the black hole  black hole merger ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transport of linear angular momentum acts as a kick on the newly formed black hole merger product : gravitational wave recoil .",
    "this effect had been estimated before by for instance @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when a black hole merger takes place in the presence of an accretion disc , the recoiling black hole will take along the part of the nuclear star cluster and accretion disc that falls within its gravitational influence area ( @xmath11 ; where @xmath12 is the mass in units of @xmath13m@xmath14and @xmath15 is the velocity in units of 1000 km s@xmath16 ; bonning , shields & salviander 2007 ) .",
    "binary smbhs surrounded by an accretion disc will have emptied the inner portion leaving a gap in the disc . upon a kick",
    "this gap will refill on a short timescale ( @xcite ) and agn activity will resume .",
    "subsequently , such recoiling black holes may become visible as off  nuclear agns ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the disc mass will allow for the agn activity to last tens of millions of years ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the source sdss  j092712.65 + 294344.0 has been proposed as a recoiling massive black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , different interpretations as a binary black hole ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or a chance alignment with a more distant source in the same cluster have also been proposed ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , sdss  j105041.35 + 345631.3 and sdss  j153636.22 + 044127.0 have been suggested as recoiling smbh candidates ( @xcite ; @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the main difference between the imbh and the smbh scenario for the hyper - luminous sources lies in their optical properties .",
    "the recoiling smbhs should carry with it the broad line region .",
    "therefore , they should contain broad lines in their optical spectra whereas this is not the case for the imbh scenario .    in this manuscript",
    "we discuss the nature of another hyper - luminous off - nuclear x - ray source : .",
    "in order to search for bright off - nuclear x - ray sources , we have selected galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release ( dr ) number 7 .",
    "we have cross - correlated this database with the source catalog in order to search for x - ray active sources . out of the resulting matches",
    "we have selected those for which the detection does not coincide with the position of the galaxy center .",
    "we selected sources where the distance between the center of the galaxy as determined by the sdss - dr7 and the x - ray position is less than 10 but larger than 2 .",
    "furthermore , the error on the x - ray position had to be less than 2 .",
    "next , we determined the redshift of the galaxy ( photometric or spectroscopic ) from the sdss database and we kept sources with a luminosity larger than 1@xmath17 erg s@xmath16 using the flux measured in the _ chandra _ source catalog .",
    "finally , we have plotted the x - ray position on the sdss @xmath18-band image to visually verify the resulting sources .",
    "below , we report on the x - ray source cxo  j122518.6 + 144545 .",
    "this source has a position 3.6 off - nuclear from a galaxy identified in the sdss dr7 as having a redshift @xmath19=0.0447 ( see fig .",
    "[ i m a ] and [ hstima ] ) .",
    "the sdss dr7 measured centre of this galaxy is at right ascencion ( r.a . ;",
    "j2000)=12:25:18.860 ( 186.328583 in decimal degrees ) and the declination ( dec ; j2000)=14:45:47.704 ( 14.763251 in decimal degrees ) .",
    "we have retrieved the x - ray observation with observation i d 8055 from the archive and reprocessed the events with calibrations available in caldb version 4.1.3 using the version 4.1.2 of the x - ray center ciao tools .",
    "the exposure time for the observation with i d 8055 is 5093  s. the source is detected 1.7off - axis on the acis s3 ccd .        band image with an exposure time of 750  s revealing the ( cluster of ) stars in the error circle .",
    "the grey circle ( red in the colour version , south - west of the image centre ) is at the position and the radius of 0.2is equal to the overall astrometric error in the position of the x - ray source .",
    "the white circle indicates the sdss dr7 position of the centre of the galaxy , the radius is 0.25 .",
    "the figure is made from the combined , 750  s - long drizzled hst image .",
    ", width=302 ]    using wavdetect we detect another source 84.3away from .",
    "this source is the brightest detected x - ray source and it can be identified with a bright point source in the sdss @xmath20- and @xmath18-band images ( @xmath20=20.10@xmath00.02 and @xmath18=19.25@xmath00.01 ) .",
    "we use its accurate sdss dr7 @xmath18-band position of r.a.=12:25:19.451 ( 186.33104668 ) and dec=14:47:09.262 ( 14.78590606 ) to determine a boresight correction for the observation .",
    "the optical positional accuracy depends on the localization uncertainty which for stars with @xmath21 is negligible ( @xcite ) and on the statistical and systematic uncertainty in tying the sdss @xmath18-band field to the icrs reference frame .",
    "we use the conservative values provided by @xcite ( see table  [ log ] ) .",

    "+    using this accurate @xmath18-band position , we determine a bore - sight correction of dra:0.03@xmath00.08and ddec:-0.23@xmath00.08 .",
    "the error of 0.08 on each coordinate stems from the uncertainty in localizing the x - ray bore - sight correction source . after applying this boresight correction using the tool wcs_update",
    "we obtain a best fit position for the off - nuclear x - ray source of r.a.=12:25:18.650(9 ) [ 186.32771(3 ) degrees ] and dec=14:45:45.76(8 ) [ 14.76271(2 ) degrees ] using wavdetect where the number in - between brackets denotes the 68 per cent confidence uncertainty in the last digit .",
    "these errors are due to the error in the source localization on the ccd alone .",
    "the final uncertainty on the position of the off - nuclear x - ray source is the quadratic sum of the centroiding uncertainty of the x - ray source , the uncertainty in the x - ray bore - sight correction and the uncertainty in the astrometry of the @xmath18-band image ( see table  [ log ] ) .",
    "the overall astrometric uncertainty on the x - ray source position is 0.19 which we round - off to 0.2 .    due to larger centroiding uncertainties in the positions of fainter x - ray sources",
    "the association of such fainter sources with a candidate optical counterpart is less certain .",
    "therefore , we prefer to use the bore - sight correction determined using only the one bright x - ray source mentioned above .",
    "this does imply that we ignore any uncertainty in the roll angle of the satellite , which could introduce a small effect in the bore - sight correction .",
    "since we also improve the astrometry hst images using the sdss @xmath18-band ( see below ) we could use astrometry relative to the sdss @xmath18 , however , the contribution of linking the sdss @xmath18 frame to the icrs astrometric standard frame to the error budget is small , hence we prefer to use the absolute astrometric solution .",
    "we have selected a circular region of 6 pixel ( @xmath243 ) radius centered on the source position to extract the source counts in the energy range of 0.38 kev .",
    "we limited the radius to exclude the centre of the galaxy .",
    "similarly , we have used a circular region with a radius of 80 pixels away from any source but on the same s3 ccd to extract background counts .",
    "we have made redistribution and auxilliary response matrices for the source and background region separately .",
    "the net number of background subtracted source counts is 22 .",
    "the predicted number of background source photons is 45 .",
    "standard poisson statistics shows that this is a very significant detection with a chance of less than 1@xmath25 to be due to a fluctuation in the background .",
    "using xspec version 11.3.2p ( @xcite ) we have fitted the spectrum of  using cash statistics ( @xcite ) modified to account for the subtraction of background counts , the so called w - statistics .",
    "we have used an absorbed power - law model ( pegpwrlw ) to describe the data .    due to the relatively low number of counts we fix the interstellar extinction during the fit to 2.8@xmath26 @xmath27 ; the galactic foreground @xmath28 in the direction of the source found by .",
    "the power - law index and normalisation were allowed to float .",
    "the errors on the parameters are substantial due to the low number of counts ; we obtain a power - law index of 0.9@xmath00.3 and an unabsorbed flux of @xmath29 in the range 0.38 kev .",
    "the errors are at the 68 per cent confidence level .",
    "if we fix the power - law index to 1.9 , such as found often for agn , the extinction is @xmath30 @xmath27 implying a significant amount of extinction above the galactic extinction in the direction of the source .    using standard cosmology",
    "the redshift converts to a distance of 182.6 mpc , which makes the x - ray luminosity in the range 0.38 kev @xmath31 , for comparison the 0.510 kev luminosity is @xmath32 .",

    "the 3.6 corresponds to 3.2 kpc at the distance of the galaxy .",
    "the presence of another x - ray source in the same observation coinciding with a bright optical point source , allows us to register the observation , reducing the astrometric uncertainty in the position of the off - nuclear agn - candidate to less than 0.2 , making the 3.6 offset highly significant .",
    "the 0.38 kev x - ray flux of this source is 5.4@xmath43 and its 0.38 kev ( 0.510 kev ) luminosity is 2.2@xmath3 ( 2.7@xmath3 ) given the redshift of the galaxy ( z=0.0447 , d=182.6 mpc ) .",
    "we find a candidate optical counterpart in archival hst / acs g@xmath4band observations of the field containing the galaxy obtained on june 16 , 2003 .",
    "the observed magnitude of g@xmath5 corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -10.1 taking a foreground extinction from our galaxy of @xmath44 magnitudes into account .",
    "these findings make this source an unusually bright ulx , a very bright supernova , a recoiling black hole or a background agn ( with higher luminosity ) .",
    "we discuss these possibilities below .",
    "if this x - ray source is due to a supernova , the 0.510 kev x - ray luminosity is among the highest measured for supernovae .",
    "the x - ray brightest supernovae are of type iin , this implies that the maximum optical g@xmath4-band magnitude was @xmath2417.3 ( with mean absolute blue magnitude of -19.15 type iin are also optically among the brightest supernovae ;  @xcite ) .",
    "now , more than 6 years after the initial hst / acs observations , the source magnitude will have changed considerably .",
    "the exact way and amount are difficult to predict as many scenarios are possible since the optical lightcurves of type  iin supernovae are heterogeneous and we do not know the explosion date",
    ". the supernova could have exploded in between the serendipitous hst / acs and the x - ray observation or before the hst / acs observation .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the x - ray bright type  iin supernovae peaks around 400 - 1000 days after the explosion making it impossible to discriminate between the different scenarios on the basis of the single epoch x - ray and optical observations .",
    "the g@xmath45 colour of the optical counterpart candidate is blue for a type iin supernova origin of the counterpart ( cf .",
    "@xcite for typical type iin colours ) . if the supernova occurred in between the hst / acs and the observation the hst / acs images are of the supernova progenitor star ( cluster ) .",
    "the sdss imaging data of this galaxy was taken a few weeks before the hst data and thus can not help us deciding between these scenarios .    in the ulx case",
    "the majority of known optical counterparts have blue colours and they are often embedded in an ionized optical nebula ( and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , the counterparts are usually part of small young star clusters or ob associations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the fwhm of the acs image at the distance of the galaxy corresponds to more than 100 pc hence star clusters would appear as unresolved point sources .",
    "the ulx counterparts currently known would be below the detection threshold of the hst / acs images as their absolute optical magnitude @xmath46 is between @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) while the source present in the hst / acs observation has an absolute @xmath20 magnitude of @xmath6 .",
    "this absolute magnitude is similar to the absolute magnitude of the counterpart of eso  243 - 49 proposed by @xcite .",
    "the blue colours of the candidate counterpart to make it hard to reconcile with the scenario of an imbh in a globular cluster ( cf .",
    "the colours of globular clusters in @xcite ) . comparing the limit on the @xmath49 colour with that calculated using the padua evolution tracks (; @xcite )",
    "we find that the blue colour is consistent with an imbh in a young , massive , star cluster .    in the recoiling black hole case",
    "the optical counterpart is probably related to the accretion disc , broad line region and the nuclear cluster that are retained .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the nuclear region in agns varies by more than one order of magnitude , but the faintest absolute magnitudes are @xmath50 ( ngc  4395 ; @xcite ) and @xmath51 for ngc  3031/m81 reported by @xcite in line with our finding . at an off - nuclear distance of 3.2 kpc , a recoil velocity of @xmath52300 km s@xmath16",
    "is implied if the lifetime of the agn activity is limited to @xmath53 years .",
    "the hard x - ray spectral power - law index of 0.9@xmath54 that we find implies that there is additional extinction beyond the galactic value if the intrinsic source spectrum is compatible with that of an agn .",
    "one has to worry about chance alignments on the sky . at an 0.510 kev flux of @xmath55",
    "the chance to find a background agn in a circle with radius of 3.6 is very small . from the 0.510 kev @xmath56n ",
    "@xmath56s relation found by there are approximately 76 agn per square degree . using this",
    "we derive that in a circle with radius of 3.6 on average 2@xmath57 agn is found .",
    "however , we searched 17 x - ray sources in galaxies with fluxes equal to or above 5@xmath43 , so considering this number of trials , leads to a probability of 4@xmath58 that the source is a background agn .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the source argues against a background agn",
    ". the hard x - ray spectrum of the source together with an 0.5 - 2 kev flux of @xmath59  make that the source falls well below the trend between power - law index and source 0.5 - 2 kev flux found by in their study of the lockman hole iv ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "the x - ray to optical flux ratio in the @xmath20-band is 87 and in the @xmath35-band this is larger than 84 , whereas most selected agns have values in the @xmath60-band below 10 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the optical counterpart is unrelated to the x - ray source the x - ray to optical flux ratio is larger still .",
    "however , if there is additional absorption local to the agn , the x - ray to optical flux ratio has been observed to be larger than 90 ( @xcite ) , although there are very few if any of these sources known at the x - ray flux level of  ( cf .  ) .",
    "if the optical source is related to the x - ray source but due to a background agn shining through the disc of the foreground galaxy that adds a column of 5@xmath61 , the @xmath62 colour limit would become @xmath63 which is uncharacteristically blue for an agn ( cf .",
    "the @xmath62 colours of rosat - sdss agn presented in @xcite have a mean @xmath62 colour of @xmath64 ) .",
