    "the classical thermoacoustic tomography ( tat ) problem formulates as follows . consider an object  @xmath0 contained in an open set  @xmath1 of  @xmath2 which emits an acoustic pressure wave at  @xmath3 , considered as a dirac pulse .",
    "this wave is modeled as a solution of : @xmath4 where  @xmath5 is an operator modeling an acoustic wave phenomenon . then this pressure wave is observed ( e.g. thanks to piezoelectric sensors ) and a set of observations is obtained from the solution  @xmath6 . that can be expressed thanks to an observation operator  @xmath7 mapping a solution  @xmath6 to observations  @xmath8 .",
    "the inverse tat problem consists in developing and studying methods to reconstruct  @xmath0 from  @xmath8 and to define situations in which this reconstruction is possible .    in the three past decades",
    "many techniques have been developed , offering effectual results ( see works from authors of  @xcite ,  @xcite  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite among others ) .",
    "the new techniques we propose in section  [ iswe ] rely on the following idea , influenced by  @xcite : if the system we consider is reversible in time , then the initial state to reconstruct can be seen , backward in time , as a state to reach , so that usual control and filtering techniques can be used to solve this inverse problem . for this purpose",
    ", we first used the back and forth nudging algorithm ( see  @xcite ) in  @xcite . with filtering techniques , as the kalman filter defined in  @xcite and one of its reduced rank formulation ,",
    "the seek filter ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we deal here with possible improvements of this method .",
    "of course , many assumptions are necessary to obtain a favorable observation situation : the way the wave propagates , depending on the media and on the kind of the wave , the final time and the number , size and position of the sensors recording the wave command the information contained in the data ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite and the references therein ) . moreover , even if the continuous problem is well set , numerical issues still put up some resistance , as considering noisy data , algorithmic complexity or apparition of spurious high - frequency oscillations during numerical implementations ( the paper  @xcite surveys this point ) .",
    "we deal here with this issue , as done in  @xcite .",
    "we introduce an artificial attenuation term in the numerical scheme that not only yields a regularization of the solution but corrects degenerated observation configurations for which filtering techniques are not helpful .",
    "this section is devoted to main results about stabilization of the wave equation and kalman - bucy filter .",
    "then we define iterative stabilizing methods .",
    "we assume that  @xmath9 is the dalembert operator . if necessary",
    ", we can suppose that  @xmath10 and consider the stabilization problem for the initial value problem related to  @xmath5 instead of the inverse tat problem .",
    "similar considerations are also valid for linear variable speed ( reversible ) wave equations",
    ".    define  @xmath11 , for any  @xmath12 , and  @xmath13 on  @xmath14 , then  @xmath15 and equation   writes : @xmath16    the observations are defined in a hilbert space  @xmath17 .",
    "it is convenient , when working with wave equations , to consider the time derivative of the observations , so that we assume that  @xmath18 and use equally  @xmath19 or  @xmath8 . in the practice of tat , we only get observations from  @xmath6 and use its time derivative when needed .",
    "concerning stabilizability and controllability of wave equations , we have the fundamental criterion :    the _ observation inequality _ is satisfied if there exists  @xmath20 such that : @xmath21 for all  @xmath22 , where  @xmath6 is the solution of   with initial data  @xmath23 .",
    "scalar  @xmath24 is called",
    "_ observability constant_.    indeed , in  @xcite , one finds the following result :    [ prop1]the three following propositions are equivalent :    * the observation inequality   is satisfied . * for every positive - definite self - adjoint operator  @xmath25 , the operator  @xmath26 generates an exponentially stable  @xmath27-semigroup on  @xmath28 . *",
    "the system  @xmath29 is exactly controllable .",
    "many geometrical interpretations to the observation inequality have been presented , mostly known as _ geometric optics condition _ ( goc from  @xcite ) . in particular , these results explain this heuristic situation : when  @xmath30 , where  @xmath31 is an open subset of  @xmath1 , then enough energy from  @xmath23 has to pass through  @xmath31 to get enough information to reconstruct  @xmath23 .",
    "it depends on many parameters such as the position of the sensors , the speed map of the wave equation , the final time  @xmath32 , etc . in this context , we introduce a first reconstruction method , the kalman - bucy filter .",
    "we recall the main results concerning the ( continuous ) kalman - bucy filter .",
    "it yields a way to approximate the real state that minimizes the error variance in the following situation ( see  @xcite ) :    assume that the true state solves the linear differential equation  @xmath33 and the theoretical model is governed by  @xmath34",
    ". given data  @xmath35 , we denote the observation error by  @xmath36 , so as  @xmath37 .",
    "errors  @xmath36 and  @xmath38 are null mean white gaussian noise processes and their respective covariance matrices are  @xmath39 and  @xmath40",
    ".    given  @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the _ kalman - bucy filter _ consists in the two following differential equations , one to estimate the state  @xmath43 and one for the covariance matrix  @xmath44 , of a differential riccati type : @xmath45 and the kalman gain  @xmath46 is given by  @xmath47    let us explain some links between subsections  [ osw ] and  [ kseek ] . in the filters formulations , the feedback is realized thanks to an operator written  @xmath48 as feedbacks write  @xmath49 and  @xmath50 in subsection  [ osw ] .",
    "thus one can consider here that  @xmath51 weights the feedback in comparison to the model .",
    "see  @xcite for some results similar to proposition  [ prop1 ] about feedbacks  @xmath48 .",
    "we are studying different ways to define the stabilizing operator  @xmath51 , first with the nudging operator  @xmath52 , where  @xmath53 , that is in the framework of proposition  [ prop1 ] , then with filters .",
    "it leads to the following back and forth reconstruction algorithms .",
    "we get benefits from the reversibility of the wave equations , go back in time and use data again during a backward evolution , from  @xmath54 to  @xmath3 , to deduce an approximation of  @xmath0",
    ". such an idea has lead d.  auroux and j.  blum to define the back and forth nudging algorithm in  @xcite , then d.  auroux and e.  cosme improved it with the back and forth seek ( from private communication , see below for a description of the bf - seek ) .",
    "these techniques can be formulated for any sequences of positive operators  @xmath55 as follows :    given a set of observations  @xmath56 and a rough estimate  @xmath57 , define  @xmath58 .",
    "an _ iterative reconstruction method _ consists in iterating a back and forth process .",
    "the forward solution is given by : @xmath59 with initial data  @xmath60 and  @xmath61 and the backward solution solves : @xmath62 with _ final _ data  @xmath63 and  @xmath64 .",
    "the process is iterated for  @xmath65 .",
    "concerning  @xmath66 , it is left implicit that time or space derivatives of  @xmath67 and  @xmath68 can be considered .",
    "the sign preceding  @xmath69 changes for convenience of notation as one can notice that , when  @xmath32 contains a first - order time derivative , then the backward equation   writes forward : @xmath70 thanks to the variable substitution  @xmath71 .",
    "finally , the correcting term still helps to stabilize the system .",
    "note that unlike many usual methods , the model is considered here as a weak constraint , which can be useful since it may not be well known ( e.g. refer to  @xcite about simulation of inhomogeneous acoustic speed model and relative issues in tat ) .    finally , this kind of algorithms yields successive estimates  @xmath72 of the initial object to reconstruct .",
    "as explained by proposition  [ prop1 ] one knows that , under favorable observation conditions , both forward and backward equations are related to exponentially stable semigroups , that leads to the convergence of the algorithm .",
    "consider the 1-d domain  @xmath73 and  @xmath74 both uniformly gridded with steps @xmath75 and  @xmath76 .",
    "we deal with the classical finite difference time domain theta - scheme ( @xmath77-fdtd ) to simulate the wave equation .",
    "sensors are located periodically every  @xmath78 grid points from the first one .",
    "upper discussion about observability , stabilizability and controllability have their matching in this situation : a discrete observation condition occur , similar to  , which is equivalent too to the discrete stabilizability of the system ( we omit details , see  @xcite and the reference therein when  @xmath79 ) . in order to compensate for possibly damaged observation conditions , due either to sensors configuration or to noise",
    ", we carry out the solution suggested in  @xcite , adding an artificial viscous heating attenuation term in the @xmath77-fdtd , that leads to : @xmath80 where  @xmath81 ,  @xmath82 ,  @xmath83 or  @xmath84 ,  @xmath85 , and  @xmath86 stands to express both forward and backward implementations .",
    "the term  @xmath87 allows us to consider derivatives of the correcting term in the feedbacks .",
    "only main results about the kalman filter are given and we describe then how to derive the seek filter from it ( as in  @xcite ) .",
    "these algorithms divide into two steps , a _ forecast _ one and an _ analysis _ one ,",
    "in which are taken account the observations to correct the forecast , and two different kinds of parameters are considered , first the states ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) , then the relative error covariance matrices ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) or their square root ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) . definitions of the kalman and seek filters are explained respectively on left and right columns below .    given  @xmath94 ,  @xmath95 and  @xmath96 ,",

    "if the state space has a range of  @xmath107 , the forecast step necessitates  @xmath108 model evolution steps to get the forecast error covariance matrix from the analysis error covariance matrix , such that a less optimal gain may be considered to reduce calculation cost .",
    "this is the purpose of the seek to yield such a gain by considering a reduced rank gain more simple to obtain . since the error covariance matrices are symmetric and positive - definite , pham et al .",
    "@xcite suggested to consider the following decomposition : if  @xmath51 is a symmetric positive - definite  @xmath109 matrix whose  @xmath110 larger eigenvalues are  @xmath111 and their corresponding eigenvectors  @xmath112 , the _ reduced decomposition _ of  @xmath51 is defined as the  @xmath113 matrix  @xmath114 $ ] . since seek consists in using the reduced decomposition  @xmath115 of  @xmath116 ,  @xmath117 model runs define the forecast error covariance matrix .",
