    "the magellanic clouds represent a unique laboratory for studying star formation in an environment which differs from that of our galaxy .",
    "they are nearby ( in comparison to most other galaxies ) , at distances of approximately 50 and 60  kpc respectively for the large and small magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "this enables them to be studied with intrinsically high sensitivity and resolution .",
    "the relative star formation rates in both the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) are greater than in the milky way , but the metallicity is significantly lower @xcite .",
    "these conditions are thought to be similar to those in larger galaxies earlier in the history of the universe .",
    "hence studies of star formation in the magellanic clouds can yield insights into star formation at redshifts of @xmath0 .",
    "interstellar masers are excellent signposts of high - mass star formation in the milky way .",
    "they are intense and occur at wavelengths that are not significantly absorbed by intervening clouds of gas and dust @xcite .",
    "the first complete survey of the lmc and smc was recently undertaken in the 6.7-ghz transition of methanol and the 6.035-ghz transition of oh @xcite .",
    "the survey , made with the methanol multibeam receiver on the parkes telescope , had a 1-@xmath1 sensitivity of 0.13  jy and 0.09  jy over the entire smc and lmc respectively ( the extent of both clouds , as defined by the co and/or hi emission ) .",
    "the region of the lmc containing the bulk of the co emission and all the previously known masers were surveyed to a better 1-@xmath1 sensitivity of approximately 60  mjy . despite this comprehensive and sensitive search",
    "only four 6.7-ghz methanol masers have been discovered in the lmc @xcite .",
    "taking into account the relative rates of high - mass star formation in the two systems , this is a factor of 45 lower than expected on the basis of the observed luminosity distribution of galactic 6.7-ghz methanol masers @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the number of detected ground - state oh and water masers is roughly consistent with the difference in the star formation rates between the milky way and lmc .",
    "this discrepancy has been attributed to the lower metallicity of the lmc .",
    "the current rate of high - mass star formation within the magellanic clouds , and its relationship to the dynamical interaction of the clouds with the milky way , are a topic of active investigation .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ legacy program sage ( surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution ) has made observations of a number of nearby galaxies ( including the lmc ) to examine the current star formation rate @xcite .",
    "the unique association of 6.7- and 12.2-ghz methanol masers with young , high - mass star forming regions has made them very useful signposts of such regions within our galaxy .",
    "a recent comparative study of 6.7- and 12.2-ghz methanol masers in the milky way has shown that 12.2-ghz masers are preferentially associated with more luminous 6.7-ghz sources @xcite .",
    "@xcite also used their observations and comparisons with published 1.2-mm dust continuum and mid - infrared data to start to quantify the maser evolutionary scheme proposed by @xcite .",
    "they found that the 12.2-ghz methanol masers are associated with a later evolutionary phase than those sources which show emission from only the 6.7-ghz transition .",
    "the median ratio of the peak flux density of the 12.2- to the 6.7-ghz transitions was found to be 1:5.9 , similar to previous studies .",
    "it was also shown that the ratio depends on luminosity ( and hence age ) , increasing as the luminosity of the 6.7-ghz emission increases ( see fig .  4 of @xcite )    in order to investigate whether the properties of 12.2-ghz methanol masers in the lmc differ from their galactic counterparts we have undertaken new , sensitive observations towards known 6.7-ghz methanol and oh maser sources in the lmc .",
    "@xcite searched for 12.2-ghz methanol masers towards the two sources known at the time n11 ( mc18 ) and n105a ( mc23 ) , with 3-@xmath1 detection upper limits of 0.1 and 0.3  jy respectively .",
    "there are no published observations at 12.2-ghz towards the two more recently discovered 6.7-ghz methanol masers in the lmc _ iras_05011 - 6815 and n160a ( mc76 ) , nor at the locations of any of the known oh or water masers .",
    "in contrast to methanol masers , the abundance of 22-ghz water masers in the magellanic clouds appears to be consistent with that observed in the milky way .",
    "this suggests that water masers may be more useful signposts of young high - mass star formation regions within the lmc . in order to better characterize the properties of methanol and water masers in the lmc we have also made observations of the 6.7-ghz methanol and 22-ghz water masers in the lmc which were nearly contemporaneous with our 12.2-ghz search",
    "we have searched a sample of eight known maser regions in the lmc for the presence of 12.2-ghz methanol masers .",
    "the sample included all known ground and excited - state oh masers , 6.7-ghz methanol masers and 22-ghz masers in the magellanic clouds .",
    "observations were carried out with the australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) parkes 64-m radio telescope during 2008 june 2025 .",
    "the observations were made with the ku - band receiver which detected two orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "it had typical system temperatures of 205 and 225 jy for the respective polarizations throughout the observations .",
    "the parkes multibeam correlator was configured to record 8192 spectral channels across a 16-mhz bandwidth for each polarization .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity coverage of @xmath2290  @xmath3 and after hanning smoothing , a spectral resolution of 0.08  @xmath3 .",
    "the parkes radio telescope has rms pointing errors of @xmath210 arcsec and at 12.2-ghz the telescope has a half - power beam - width of 1.9  arcmin .",
    "all sources were observed at a fixed frequency of 12167-mhz ( i.e. with no doppler tracking ) , which alleviated the requirement for a unique reference observation to be made for each of the source positions .",
    "the data were processed using the same method as described in @xcite , except that a running median of 50 channels ( as opposed to 100 channels ) was used to correct the spectrum baseline .",
    "the data were reduced using the asap ( atnf spectral analysis package ) .",
    "alignment of velocity channels was carried out during processing .",
    "absolute flux density calibration was achieved by observing pksb1934 - 638 each day which has an assumed flux density of 1.825 jy at 12167-mhz @xcite .",
    "each of the fields was observed for 160170 minutes , resulting in a typical rms in the final spectrum ( after hanning smoothing and averaging over polarizations and time ) of 27  mjy and a corresponding 5-@xmath1 limit of 0.135  jy .",
    "the adopted rest frequency was 12.178597  ghz @xcite .",
    "the 6.7-ghz observations reported by @xcite were made in 2006 june and september , approximately 2 years prior to the 12.2-ghz observations reported here .",
    "as masers are known to be variable we undertook additional 6.7-ghz observations using the parkes 64-m radio telescope in 2008 august ( @xmath4 2 months after the 12.2-ghz observations ) using the methanol multibeam receiver .",
    "the observations were made in mx mode , with 10 minutes per - beam on source toward each of the four known 6.7-ghz methanol maser sites ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the system parameters ) .",
    "we recorded a 4 mhz bandpass for each beam , for each of two circular polarizations for both the 6.7-ghz methanol and the 6.035 mhz oh transitions .",
    "the spectra were produced by an autocorrelation spectrometer with 2048 spectral channels .",
    "the data were not hanning smoothed and the resulting velocity resolution for the 6.7-ghz observations was 0.11  @xmath3 .",
    "this is very similar to the velocity resolution of the 12.2-ghz observations . a fault with one of the beams ( beam 3 ) meant that its data had to be excluded , resulting in an on - source integration time of 60 minutes per source .",
    "the 22-ghz water maser observations were made with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) during 2008 august 18,19 , with the array in the 6b configuration .",
    "the observations were made in director s time allocations and spanned approximately 7 hours on the first day and 5 hours on the second day .",
    "a total of eight different pointing centres were observed .",
    "these covered the locations of all the 11 previously known star - formation maser sites in the lmc .",
    "the observing band was centred at a fixed frequency of 22213 mhz .",
    "the correlator was configured with 1024 channels across a 16 mhz bandwidth recording a single linear polarization and also allowing measurement of continuum emission .",
    "the data were not smoothed , giving a velocity resolution of approximately 0.25  @xmath3 and a usable velocity range of approximately 195 @xmath3 .",
    "pksb1934 - 638 was used as the primary flux calibrator , which at this frequency is assumed to have a flux density of 0.83 jy @xcite .",
    "observations of pksb0537 - 441 were used to calibrate the bandpass and pksb0637 - 752 was used as the phase calibrator .",
    "the observations were made as a series of 90 second integrations .",
    "these were regularly interleaved with observations of the phase calibrator . in total , each source was observed 9 or 10 times over the two observing sessions resulting in an onsource time of 13.5 or 15 minutes per source .",
    "we also used the line - free spectral channels from the water maser observations to search for continuum emission associated with the star formation regions .",
    "the observations had only a 16-mhz bandwidth and thus were not very sensitive ; however they do have higher spatial resolution than previous studies of these regions .",
    "the typical rms for the continuum images was 0.20.3  mjy beam@xmath5 .",
    "the known lmc masers are contained in eight distinct fields which were targets for a 12.2-ghz methanol maser search .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] lists either the detected peak flux density and velocity , or the 5-@xmath1 noise level in the final spectrum .",
    "a heliocentric velocity range of 120  450 @xmath3 was observed for each source . the only source detected was n105a ( mc23 ) , which coincidentally was also the first 6.7-ghz methanol maser detected in the lmc .",
    "the 12.2 ghz spectrum of n105a is shown in the upper panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : n105a ] .",
    "the peak of the 12.2-ghz emission is 0.12  jy ( 4.6-@xmath1 ) .",
    "as it is within the velocity range of the 6.7-ghz emission , and is also apparent when the total 12.2-ghz dataset is split in half , or when the two polarizations are examined independently , we are confident that it is a genuine detection .    comparing our 12.2-ghz spectrum of n105a with the 6.7-ghz emission observed in 2006 june @xcite shows that the 12.2-ghz peak coincides with the second strongest spectral peak in this source .",
    "@xcite found that for approximately 75 per cent of the sources where they detected both 12.2- and 6.7-ghz emission the peak of the two spectra occurred at the same velocity .",
    "for the remaining 25 per cent the 12.2-ghz peak coincided with a secondary 6.7-ghz feature .",
    "although the association of the 12.2-ghz methanol maser with a secondary 6.7-ghz spectral feature is not unusual , it is also possible that the 6.7-ghz maser may have varied in the period between the observations reported by @xcite ( june 2006 ) and these observations .",
    "comparison of the august 2008 6.7-ghz methanol maser spectrum , with that shown in fig .",
    "3 of @xcite shows no detectable variation over the two - year period between the observations .",
    "the observations of the other known 6.7-ghz methanol masers in the lmc and the 6.035-ghz oh maser in n160a also show no significant changes in the absolute , or relative intensity of the maser features compared to those published by @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .      [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,^ \" , ]     [ tab : ir ]    @xcite have independently searched for yso candidates in the lmc .",
    "their analysis , likewise , used the sage data , but also included a large amount of published and archival data from other wavelengths .",
    "we have compared the positions of the interstellar masers in the lmc with their catalogue and find that 11 of the 16 locations are within 2 arcseconds of an object they have classified as a `` definite '' yso .",
    "the sources without an associated yso candidate all lie in regions where there is a complex background , or a bright source nearby ( robert gruendl , private communication ) .",
    "it is striking that the methods used by @xcite and @xcite to identify ysos in the lmc ( with the bulk of the observational data in common ) produce such very different results .",
    "clearly @xcite have been much more successful in identifying the young , high - mass objects with which masers are associated .",
    "we have compared the infrared properties of the maser - associated sources to those of the whole sample of definite ysos identified by @xcite ( their table  9 ) .",
    "our initial examination of infrared colour - colour and colour - magnitude diagrams suggested that the maser - associated ysos tended to be brighter in all near and mid - infrared wavelength bands and generally have redder colours than the bulk of yso candidates ( figure  [ fig : colmag ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the maser - associated sources being more luminous and more deeply embedded than the bulk of yso candidates , and may be useful for identifying regions of parameter space associated with the rare , and highly sought youngest high - mass stars .",
    "the discrimination of the maser - associated sources is most clearly seen in the colour - magnitude diagrams , which explains why similar investigations undertaken with samples of galactic masers typically produce less conclusive results . for galactic sources",
    "the broad range of distances to the sources adds additional scatter to the observed magnitudes , an effect which is difficult to correct for when the distances to most sources are poorly known . for the [ 8.0 ] versus [ 4.5]-[8.0 ] colour - magnitude diagram",
    "the masers - associated sources all satisfy the criteria [ 4.5]-[8.0 ] @xmath6 2.5 and [ 8.0 ] @xmath7 12.5-([4.5]-[8.0 ] ) .",
    "a total of 352 of the 855 ysos meet these criteria .",
    "for the [ 3.6 ] versus [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colour - magnitude diagram the maser - associated sources ( with one exception ) satisfy the criteria [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath6 0.5 and [ 3.6 ] @xmath6 12.2+([3.6]-[4.5 ] ) and a total of 251 of the 855 ysos in the lmc meet these criteria .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : colmag ] indicate these criteria for each colour - magnitude diagram . taking the union of the two sets results in a total of 195 ysos satisfying both sets of criteria ( 22 percent of the sample as a whole ) .",
    "recent statistical investigations of millimetre dust clumps with and without associated masers has enabled the development of models which predict the presence of a maser on the basis of the dust - clump properties @xcite .",
    "these models also allowed some inferences to be made about the critical physical properties which determine the presence of a maser .",
    "motivated by the apparent differences between those ysos with , and those without masers in the colour - magnitude diagrams we decided to undertake a similar investigation using the infrared photometric data compiled by @xcite for the sample of ysos in the lmc .",
    "we constructed boxplots for each of the nine wavelength bands available ( j , h , k from the two micron all sky survey , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath8 m from irac and 24 and 70 @xmath8 m from mips ) which show that in each of these wavelength bands the ysos associated with masers tend to be more luminous than the sample as a whole ( figure  [ fig : boxplot ] ) .",
    "the photometric data in @xcite is only complete for the 4.5- and 8.0-@xmath8 m bands , as these were used in the initial selection of yso candidates .",
    "while most sources have measurements for all of the irac wavelength bands , this is not the case for the 2mass and mips data , especially for the maser - associated ysos . in order to objectively test whether the maser - associated ysos are more luminous than the sample as a whole we performed a @xmath9-test for each wavelength band to determine if the two groups have a different mean .",
    "the @xmath9-test returned a statistically significant result ( @xmath10 95 per cent probability that the means of the two samples are different ) for each of the k- , 3.6- , 4.5- , 5.8- , 8.0- and 24-@xmath8 m bands which gave @xmath11-values of 0.03 , 0.0003 , 0.0004 , 0.0001 , 0.0004 and 0.02 respectively . for the other wavelength bands the number of maser - associated yso with a measurement was in all but one case , less than half the sample ( of 11 sources ) , which prevented meaningful statistical comparisons from being undertaken .",
    "we also investigated the infrared colours formed from the irac data . from",
    "the four wavelength bands six independent colours can be formed .",
    "the three colours which include data from the 3.6-@xmath8 m band all have a statistically different mean ( as measured by a @xmath9-test ) for the maser - associated sources compared with the rest of the sample .",
    "the @xmath11-values for the difference in the mean for the [ 3.6]-[8.0 ] , [ 3.6]-[5.8 ] and [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colours are 0.03 , 0.03 and 0.01 respectively . in each case",
    "the maser - associated sources have a larger mean colour ( they are `` redder '' ) , than the rest of the sample",
    ".    it would be desirable to fit a binomial generalised linear model ( glm ) to the infrared data to predict the properties of sources likely to be associated with a maser .",
    "however , in order to undertake such modeling the only sources which can be used are those where the presence or absence of a maser is well established , and which have data for all the parameters . for this reason , it was only practical to consider using the irac data for the glm fitting as the data for the other wavelength bands are much less complete .",
    "of the 855 definite yso sources identified by @xcite 814 have observations for all four irac wavelength bands .",
    "unfortunately , the small number of detected methanol masers and the targeted / incomplete nature of the water maser searches meant that for neither transition was glm modeling practical due to the small sample sizes .",
    "[ fig : colmag ] uses blue squares to represent those yso within a maser field which do not have an associated maser .",
    "it is clear that the majority of these sources have similar infrared properties to the maser associated sources .",
    "this is in contrast to our findings when we compared the maser - associated ysos to the rest of the sample . when we perform @xmath9-tests comparing those ysos which fall within a maser field with the rest of the sample we find a statistically significant difference between the means of the two samples for all the infrared bands with the exception of the mips 70  @xmath8 m band ( where there is insufficient data in the yso near a maser sample ) .",
    "in addition to this , the @xmath11-values from the @xmath9-tests are in all cases lower than when comparing the masers associated ysos with the rest of the maser sample .",
    "this is likely to be because the presence of a strong water maser signposts a young high - mass star formation region and since they form in clusters there are likely to be other similar sources nearby .",
    "this is in contrast with most of the yso sources , which differ significantly in their infrared properties from those associated with masers .",
    "they are likely to either be from more - evolved regions or associated with low- or intermediate - mass star formation .    in summary ,",
    "while we have established that there is a statistically significant difference between the infrared properties of maser - associated ysos compared to the whole sample , the information we have on the presence or absence of masers is insufficient to enable us to undertake predictive statistical modeling at the present time .",
    "colour - colour and colour - magnitude diagrams are useful for identifying regions of parameter space which favour certain types of objects .",
    "they are always subject to a degree of confusion however , due to overlaps in the colour ranges of different types of objects ( as nicely demonstrated by * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , they are often incomplete ( sources need measurements in each of three or four wavelength bands to be included ) , or they do not utilize all the available information ( for sources where there are measurements in other wavebands ) . fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a source has the advantage that it can utilize all the available information for a particular source . we have used the online fitting sed tool of @xcite to investigate the sed s of those ysos associated with masers and also the properties of the other lmc ysos .",
    "the sed s are fitted to a grid of two - dimensional radiative transfer models of ysos consisting of a central star surrounded by an accreting disk and envelope @xcite .",
    "the limitations inherent in the assumptions , implementation and results of the model have been extensively discussed in the literature ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we will not repeat them here .    in order to fit each of the 855 definite yso sources of @xcite , we used an automated script to populate the online fitting form with the infrared data and download the best - fit model parameters for each source .",
    "we have used the photometric measurements of @xcite for each of the bands where they are available .",
    "when there was no reported measurement for a particular waveband we have assumed upper limits of 17.6 , 16.9 and 16.1 magnitudes for the j- , h- and ks - band deep 2mass observations towards the lmc @xcite and upper limits of 19.3 and 16.1 magnitudes for the irac 3.6- and 5.8-@xmath8 m bands ( the observations are complete in the other irac bands due to the selection criteria ) @xcite . where no measurement was available for the mips 24- and 70-@xmath8 m bands we chose not to use the upper limit values in the fit , as in many cases the sources are in regions of extended or saturated emission at these wavelengths , rather than regions with no emission . following @xcite we have assumed aperture sizes of 3 arcseconds for the 2mass observations , 5 arcseconds for irac observations , 10 arcseconds for mips 24  @xmath8 m and 20 arcseconds for mips 70  @xmath8 m .",
    "we allowed the distance to vary between 48 and 52  kpc and the visual extinction ( along the line of sight ) to vary between 0 and 2 magnitudes ( the mean value for the interstellar extinction towards the lmc measured by @xcite is 0.3 magnitudes ) .",
    "[ fig : sedfit ] shows some examples of the resulting sed fits for maser and non - maser associated ysos .",
    "there are between seven and nine infrared intensities or upper limits available for each source and in most cases the chi - squared for the resulting sed fits are reasonable .",
    "however , because of the large number of sources modeled we have made no attempt to remove sources where this was not the case .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed_box ] shows the distribution of some of the sed model fit parameters for the ysos associated with masers compared to the other ysos in the @xcite sample . for most of the parameters there is a large range present in both categories of yso and in many cases the distributions are highly skewed ( e.g. the envelope mass shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed_box ] ) .",
    "for skewed distributions it is more appropriate to use the mann - whitney test to determine if the two samples have a different median , rather than the @xmath9-test ( which compares the means ) .",
    "the mann - whitney test returns statistically significant results ( @xmath11-value @xmath4 0.05 ) for five of the model parameters , the mass of the central star ( 0.001 ) , the outer radius of the envelope ( 0.05 ) , the ambient density ( 0.01 ) , the inclination to the line of sight ( 0.01 ) and the total luminosity ( 0.0008 ) .",
    "the inferences which can be drawn from these results is clear .",
    "the masers are associated with high - mass , luminous ysos where the sed is dominated by a large envelope and are located in regions where the ambient density is higher than in the vicinity of most ysos .    the outer radius of the envelope and the inclination to the line of sight the results appear to be influenced by details of the modeling process .",
    "the maximum outer radius of the envelope used by the model is @xmath12 au , and that is the fitted value for 9 of the 11 maser - associated ysos ( compared to 360 of the other 844 sources ) .",
    "essentially this result is consistent with the masers being associated with higher mass objects , which would be expected to arise from the largest clumps / envelopes of gas and dust .",
    "similarly for the inclination angle the maximum value available in the models is 87.13@xmath13 , and that is the fitted value for 7 of the 11 maser - associated ysos ( compared to 252 of the other 844 sources ) .",
    "naively , it seems unlikely that geometry of the star forming region should play a significant role in whether we see a luminous water maser associated with a particular source and such a result is likely to be an artifact of the modeling process .",
    "however , water masers are typically associated with outflows and an outflow - axis near perpendicular to the line of sight will produce the maximum line - of - sight velocity coherent path length and hence the most luminous water masers .",
    "@xcite suggest that the inclination angle is one of the most important parameters in determining the sed for young objects , as it controls the contribution from the inner , hotter regions of the envelope due to orientation of the bipolar cavity .",
    "the preference for the maser - associated ysos to best fit models with high inclination angles then means that there is little or no contribution from the inner regions in these seds .",
    "an alternative interpretation of these results would be that additional obscuring material is present for the highest mass ysos in comparison to lower - mass objects .",
    "we have compared the sed model parameters of the maser - associated ysos with other ysos in the maser fields .",
    "we applied the mann - whitney test for all of the model parameters to compare these two samples and the only statistically significant result ( @xmath11-value 0.03 ) was for the inclination to the line of sight .",
    "the fact that the inclination angle again shows a statistically significant difference warrants further future investigation to determine whether it is an artifact of the modeling process , or if it has a physical basis . since the sed model fits are based on the same infrared data for which we found no significant difference between the maser - associated ysos and those in the maser fields , it it not surprising that we see a similar lack of difference in the sed models .",
    "this means that , as for the infrared properties it is not possible to undertake glm modeling to try and statistically predict which of the other ysos in the lmc may have an associated luminous water maser .",
    "the best we can do is to look for other ysos for which the fitted models are very similar to those associated with masers .",
    "of the list of 844 ysos in the lmc which are not known to have an associated water maser there are a total of 17 for which each of the mass of the central star , total luminosity , ambient density , outer radius of the envelope and inclination to the line of sight are all greater than or equal to the median of the maser - associated yso sample .",
    "these ysos are 044927.29 - 691206.3 , 045358.57 - 691106.6 , 045426.06 - 691102.3 , 051004.00 - 685438.3 , 051328.26 - 692241.8 , 051922.98 - 693940.5 , 052208.52 - 675922.1 , 052257.55 - 680414.1 , 053205.89 - 662530.9 , 053603.03 - 673234.2 , 53831.62 - 690214.6 , 053912.67 - 692941.4 , 053937.04 - 694536.7 , 053937.53 - 694609.8 , 053945.94 - 693839.2 , 054309.58 - 675006.6 & 054630.37 - 693458.6 .",

    "a sensitive search for 12.2-ghz methanol masers towards a sample of eight fields containing all currently known methanol , oh and water masers in the large magellanic cloud has resulted in the detection of one source .",
    "this is the first detection of a 12.2-ghz methanol maser outside our galaxy .",
    "our sample size is too small and our observations have insufficient sensitivity to determine if there is any difference in the properties of the different maser transitions in the lmc compared to the galaxy ; however they are consistent with the previously observed underabundance of methanol masers in the lmc .",
    "we have also observed the water masers associated with known high - mass star formation regions in the lmc and discovered six new sites .",
    "five of these are in regions where emission had previously been detected , while the sixth is a weak new water maser detected towards the strongest 6.7-ghz methanol maser in the lmc _ iras_05011 - 6815 .",
    "we find most of the star - formation masers in the lmc for which accurate positions are available are associated with sources identified as yso on the basis of their infrared properties .",
    "the ysos associated with masers tend to be more luminous and redder than the sample as a whole .",
    "we suggest that this is likely due to the masers being associated with young high - mass star formation regions .",
    "sed modeling of the ysos shows that the masers are preferentially associated with sources with a high central mass , total luminosity and ambient density .",
    "this is consistent with expectations from galactic maser studies .",
