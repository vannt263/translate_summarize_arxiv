    "there have been several investigations , both analytical and numerical , of the approach to the singularity in inhomogeneous cosmologies.@xcite-@xcite the most extensively studied class of these spacetimes is the class of gowdy spacetimes@xcite on @xmath0 .",
    "theorems due to isenberg and moncrief@xcite showed that the polarized gowdy spacetimes are asymptotically velocity term dominated ( avtd ) .",
    "it was then natural to ask whether this is also true of the more general unpolarized gowdy spacetimes .",
    "this was a more difficult question since the relevant equations are linear in the polarized case but nonlinear in the unpolarized case . to address this question , berger and",
    "moncrief@xcite performed numerical simulations of the approach to the singularity in gowdy spacetimes .",
    "they obtained the following curious result : the behavior is avtd except at a set of isolated points . at and near these exceptional points ,",
    "features appear that grow ever steeper and narrower as the singularity is approached .",
    "berger and moncrief referred to these features as `` spiky features , '' though for brevity we will simply call them `` spikes . '' these spikes form a `` fine structure '' on the simpler and more prevalent behavior of the rest of the spacetime .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to review what is known about these spikes .",
    "section 2 presents the basic equations governing the gowdy spacetimes on @xmath0 .",
    "the next three sections concern a variety of methods and results , with numerical methods and results presented in section 3 , analytical approximations in section 4 and mathematical results in section 5 .",

    "the @xmath7 spatial topology is imposed by having @xmath8 and having @xmath3 and @xmath9 be periodic functions of @xmath6 .",
    "the vacuum einstein field equations split into `` evolution '' equations for @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 and `` constraint '' equations for @xmath9 @xmath13   \\label{lambdat } \\\\",

    "the constraint equations determine @xmath9 once @xmath10 and @xmath11 are known .",
    "the integrability conditions for the constraint equations are satisfied as a consequence of the evolution equations .",
    "since the evolution equations do not depend on @xmath9 there is essentially a complete decoupling of constraints from evolution equations .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of this paper we will treat only equations ( [ evolvept]-[evolveqt ] ) . the only restriction that the constraints place on initial data for equations ( [ evolvept]-[evolveqt ] ) is the following : since @xmath4 at @xmath15 is the same as @xmath4 at @xmath16 , it follows that the integral from @xmath17 to @xmath18 of the right hand side of equation ( [ lambdax ] ) must vanish .",
    "we require that this restriction is satisfied by the initial data for equations ( [ evolvept]-[evolveqt ] ) and then these equations insure that the restriction is also satisfied at subsequent times .",
    "the singularity is at @xmath19 .",
    "it is often helpful to introduce the coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "thus the singularity is approached as @xmath21 . in terms of this coordinate ,",
    "the evolution equations ( [ evolvept]-[evolveqt ] ) become @xmath22    equations ( [ evolveptau]-[evolveqtau ] ) are the equations of motion corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24    one can also put the evolution equations ( [ evolvept]-[evolveqt ] ) in characteristic form : define null coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 and characteristic variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 given by @xmath29 then equations ( [ evolvept]-[evolveqt ] ) become @xmath30 \\label{au } \\\\ { b_{,\\eta } } = { { ( \\xi + \\eta ) } ^{-1}}[cd+(b - a)/2 ] \\label{bw } \\\\ { c_{,\\xi}}={{(\\xi + \\eta ) } ^{-1}}[-ad+(c - d)/2 ] \\label{cu } \\\\ { d_{,\\eta}}={{(\\xi + \\eta ) } ^{-1}}[-bc+(d - c)/2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as we will see in the next section , each of these different ways of writing the evolution equations has its uses for numerical simulations .",
    "we now consider numerical simulations of the evolution equations for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "since we wish to examine the behavior as the singularity is approached , it is most convenient to simulate equations ( [ evolveptau]-[evolveqtau ] ) and examine the behavior for large @xmath31 .",
    "one simple numerical method is to use centered differences for spatial derivatives and the iterated crank - nicholson ( icn ) method@xcite for time evolution .",
    "( spikes were first found@xcite using the symplectic method to be described below . however , the icn method has been used@xcite to simulate gowdy spacetimes with spatial topology @xmath32 ) .",
    "the icn method is in the class of so called `` predictor - corrector '' methods : first taking a crude approximation to the evolution and then refining it .",
    "the symplectic method is in the class of `` operator splitting '' methods : splitting the equations of motion into two pieces , each of which is evolved separately . here",
    "centered differences means that for a quantity @xmath33 at spatial grid point @xmath34 we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the icn method is the following : we put the equations in the form @xmath37 ( _ i.e. _ first order in time ) by making @xmath38 and @xmath39 extra variables .",

    "this process is iterated 3 times to evolve to the next time step .",
    "we wish to consider small scale structure generated by the approach to the singularity .",

''    figures ( [ fig3 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) provide a closer look at the true spike at @xmath59 while figures ( [ fig5 ] ) and ( [ fig6 ] ) do the same for the false spike .",

    "figure ( [ fig8 ] ) shows @xmath11 at the false spike at @xmath51 and @xmath55 .",
    "the icn method that we have described is second order accurate .",
    "however , one might want higher order accuracy , and this is provided by the symplectic methods used in@xcite . the symplectic method@xcite works as follows : begin with a system whose equations of motion come from a hamiltonian of the form @xmath23 where the sub - hamiltonians @xmath61 and @xmath62 each correspond to a system that can be solved in closed form .",
    "( note that this condition is satisfied by the gowdy evolution equations ( [ evolveptau]-[evolveqtau ] ) where the corresponding sub - hamiltonians are given in equations ( [ kinetic]-[potential ] ) ) .",
    "let @xmath63 be the evolution operator that corresponds to evolving the system with hamiltonian @xmath61 for a time @xmath64 .",
    "correspondingly define @xmath65 .",
    "now consider the operator @xmath66 defined by @xmath67 in words , @xmath66 evolves using @xmath61 for half a time step , then using @xmath62 for a full time step and then using @xmath61 for half a time step .",
    "one can show@xcite that @xmath68 is a second order accurate operator for the full system described by @xmath23 . furthermore , using @xmath68 one can construct evolution operators of any accuracy one wishes .",
    "the fourth order accurate operator @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 { { \\cal u}_{(2)}}(s\\delta \\tau ) \\label{u4def}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 .",
    "the general nth order accurate operator @xmath72 is built recursively from lower order @xmath72 in similar ways .",
    "to take advantage of nth order accuracy in time , the codes must also have nth order accuracy in space .",
    "thus the second order accurate centered differences must be replaced by more complicated finite differences that are nth order accurate .",
    "there is another advantage besides higher order accuracy in using the symplectic method to study the approach to the singularity : as the singularity is approached , @xmath62 appears to become small compared to @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath62 were completely negligible , then the operator @xmath68 ( and therefore @xmath69 and all higher order @xmath72 ) would be exact .",
    "thus as the singularity is approached , the symplectic method may be even more accurate than one might guess from the formal order of accuracy .",
    "( this fact has been used in simulations of mixmaster spacetimes@xcite . )",
    "a numerical method will be accurate only if there are enough spatial points to resolve all features .",
    "however , the spikes grow ever narrower ; thus for any fixed resolution there will come a time when that resolution is not sufficient to resolve the spikes .",
    "indeed the simulations of @xcite are often run so long that some spikes are not resolved ; however it is argued in@xcite that this does not affect the accuracy of the simulation in regions away from the spikes .",
    "to resolve the spikes for a long time , it is better to use a grid that does not have a fixed resolution .",
    "one way to do this is to use the technique of adaptive mesh refinement ( amr).@xcite this technique adds extra mesh points in places where the existing mesh is not sufficiently fine to resolve the features .",
    "amr was applied to the gowdy spacetimes by hern and stewart.@xcite unfortunately , amr codes are quite involved and difficult to write .",
    "moreover , the full machinery of amr may not be needed since it appears that in a given gowdy spacetime there is a limited number of spikes and that their positions change very little as the singularity is approached .",
    "one can then construct a mesh that is finer in the places where one knows the spikes will be.@xcite    alternatively , one can study a single spike using a characteristic method.@xcite here , the initial data surface is an outgoing light ray and one evolves along ingoing light rays",
    ". one can choose the last grid point to correspond to the light ray that hits the center of the spike at the singularity .",
    "as a consequence of this choice , the grid shrinks as the evolution proceeds in such a way that the grid is always of an appropriate size to resolve the spike .",
    "we now turn to analytical approximations to the equations of motion ( [ evolveptau]-[evolveqtau ] ) .",
    "our treatment closely follows that of@xcite .",
    "one obvious approximation is the following : since the approach to the singularity is @xmath21 , it is natural to neglect terms in equations ( [ evolveptau]-[evolveqtau ] ) proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "dropping such terms results in the following equations : @xmath74 these equations are called the velocity term dominated ( vtd ) equations .",
    "( note that the vtd equations are the equations of motion corresponding to the sub - hamiltonian @xmath61 ) .",
    "a solution of equations ( [ evolveptau]-[evolveqtau ] ) is called asymptotically velocity term dominated ( avtd ) if there is a solution of the vtd equations that it approaches as @xmath21 .",
    "the vtd equations can be solved in closed form with the general solution given by @xmath75 , \\label{vtdpsoln } \\\\ q = q + { { { e^{-p}}\\sin \\psi \\tanh v \\tau}\\over   { 1 + \\cos \\psi \\tanh v \\tau}}. \\label{vtdqsoln}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath76 and the quantities @xmath77 and @xmath78 are functions of @xmath6 .",

    "then the behavior of @xmath10 can be regarded as the the dynamics of a particle in these potentials .",
    "if @xmath123 then a `` bounce '' off of @xmath124 will give rise to a transition @xmath125 which will make @xmath38 positive .",

    "eventually , after a finite number of bounces @xmath38 will be in the range @xmath130 .",

    "this term is thus negligible provided that @xmath136 or equivalently that @xmath38 at the center of the spike is less than 2 .",
    "this leaves open the question of what happens to `` high velocity '' spikes , _",
    "i.e. _ those for which @xmath38 at the center of the spike is initially larger than 2",
    ". this question was answered recently in the numerical work of@xcite .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show that initially high velocity spikes are forced by the term @xmath134 to lower velocity . in the end , either the spike itself disappears or the velocity at the center of the spike is brought to the range @xmath137 .",
    "here we consider two mathematical questions about spikes : ( 1 ) are spikes geometrical features or coordinate artifacts ? and ( 2 ) to what extent are solutions with spikes rigorously proven to exist ?",
    "this section is essentially a summary of the results of@xcite .",
    "the reader should see that work and references therein for a more detailed treatment .",
    "so far we have presented the spikes in terms of the behavior of @xmath10 and @xmath11 as functions of @xmath31 and @xmath6 .",
    "that is , we have considered the coordinate dependence of metric components .",
    "one might then wonder whether the spikes are simply artifacts of the coordinate system in which the metric ( [ gowdymetric ] ) is expressed .",
    "however , the gowdy coordinates and metric components themselves have geometric meaning in terms of the symmetries of the spacetime .",
    "the coordinate @xmath5 is defined by the area of each symmetry @xmath138 being @xmath139 . the coordinate",
    "@xmath6 is the harmonic function conjugate to @xmath5 ( see chapter 3 , problem 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the vector fields @xmath140 and @xmath141 are killing fields .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of inner products of killing fields .",
    "nonetheless , there is a restricted coordinate freedom that preserves this relation between coordinates and geometry . in particular , consider the transformation that simply switches the coordinates @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "this leaves the metric in the form of ( [ gowdymetric ] ) but changes the pair @xmath144 to @xmath145 given by @xmath146 following @xcite we will use the notation @xmath147 where the `` i '' is for inversion .",
    "now suppose that @xmath144 is a solution of the vtd equations without spikes and which therefore has the large @xmath31 behavior @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then @xmath148 has the large @xmath31 behavior @xmath149 therefore @xmath148 has a false spike at points where @xmath84 vanishes .",
    "thus false spikes are not geometric quantities since they can be made to appear and disappear by a coordinate transformation .    in contrast",
    "true spikes can be shown to be true geometric objects .",
    "this is done by examining the behavior of curvature invariants at the spikes as the singularity is approached .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of curvature invariants as the singularity is approached is different at a true spike than at nearby points .",
    "we now turn to a different type of transformation that takes a solution @xmath144 of equations ( [ evolveptau]-[evolveqtau ] ) and produces a solution @xmath150 that represents a different spacetime .",
    "the transformation is given by @xmath151 this transformation is essentially the analog for gowdy spacetimes of the kramer - neugebauer transformation@xcite for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes .",
    "the integrability conditions for equations ( [ geqa]-[geqb ] ) are satisfied as a result of the equations of motion ( [ evolveptau]-[evolveqtau ] ) .",
    "following@xcite we will use the notation @xmath152 . here",
    "the `` ge '' stands for `` gowdy to ernst . '' for our purposes what is important is that if @xmath144 has a false spike then @xmath153 will have a true spike .",
    "thus from a solution @xmath144 with no spikes at all we can generate a solution @xmath154 with true spikes .",
    "the problem of proving existence of solutions with spikes has thus been reduced to the problem of proving existence of solutions with no spikes .",
    "how then does one prove existence of solutions with no spikes ?",
    "here we simply sketch what is done and refer the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "at first it might seem that what is needed is a global existence theorem .",
    "however , spikes are essentially asymptotic behavior as the singularity is approached . thus a local existence theorem will suffice provided that it is local in a neighborhood of the singularity .",
    "what is needed for such a theorem is to put the equations in fuchsian form @xmath155 for a system described by the vector valued function @xmath156 .",
    "one needs certain properties for the function @xmath157 and matrix @xmath158 . using these properties ,",
    "one proves that there exists a solution in a neighborhood of @xmath19 and with @xmath159 at @xmath19 . to write the gowdy equations in fuchsian form , one must first correctly guess ( based on equations ( [ vtdpsoln]-[vtdqsoln ] ) ) functions that have the @xmath160 behavior of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "one then writes @xmath10 and @xmath11 as these functions plus remainder terms .",
    "one then rewrites the gowdy evolution equations ( [ evolvept]-[evolveqt ] ) as a fuchsian system for the remainder terms . in this way existence of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the appropriate asymptotic behavior",
    "is proved .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 obtained in this way do not have spikes .",
    "however , applying the transformations i and ge to this @xmath10 and @xmath11 one obtains a rigorous proof of existence of gowdy spacetimes with spikes .",
    "when spikes were first found by berger and moncrief@xcite they seemed quite mysterious .",
    "now , about a decade later , we have a very good understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "a variety of numerical simulations have allowed us a close look at the process of spike formation and at the properties of the spikes .",
    "analytical approximations give us an understanding of how the spikes form as well as an approximate description of their shape and time development .",
    "mathematical results have shown that the false spikes are mere coordinate artifacts while the true spikes are real geometric phenomena .",
