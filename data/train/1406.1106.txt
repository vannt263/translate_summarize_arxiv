    "the aim of this study is to draw a connection between topological surgery in dimensions 1 , 2 and 3 and many natural phenomena . for this",
    "we introduce new theoretical concepts which allow to explain the topology of such phenomena via surgery and also to connect topological surgeries in different dimensions .",
    "the new concepts are the introduction of forces , attracting or repelling , in the process of surgery , the notion of solid 1- and 2-dimensional surgery and the notion of truncated 1- , 2- and 3-dimensional surgery .",
    "topological surgery is a technique used for changing the homeomorphism type of a topological manifold , thus for creating new manifolds out of known ones .",
    "a homeomorphism between two @xmath0-manifolds is a continuous bijection , such that the inverse map is also continuous .",
    "further , manifolds with homeomorphic boundary may be attached together and a homeomorphism between their boundaries can be used as ` glue ' .",
    "@xmath0-dimensional topological surgery _ on an @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 is , roughly , the topological procedure whereby an appropriate @xmath0-manifold with boundary is removed from @xmath1 and is replaced by another @xmath0-manifold with the same boundary , using a ` gluing ' homeomorphism , thus creating a new @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 ( not necessarily different from the starting one ) .",
    "for details see , for example , @xcite",
    ".    apart from just being a formal topological procedure , topological surgery appears in nature in numerous , diverse processes of various scales for ensuring new results .",
    "such processes are initiated by attracting or repelling forces between two points , or _ ` poles ' _ , which seem to be joined by some _",
    "invisible ` thread'_. to list some examples , 1-dimensional surgery happens in dna recombination and in the reconnection of cosmic magnetic lines .",
    "2-dimensional surgery is exhibited in the formation of whirls , in blowing bubbles , in the falaco solitons and in the cell mitosis .",
    "3-dimensional surgery can be observed , for example , in the formation of tornadoes , or the magnetic field excited by a current loop .",
    "surgery in nature is usually performed on basic manifolds with boundary . in each dimension",
    "the basic closed ( compact without boundary ) , connected , oriented ( c.c.o . )",
    "@xmath0-manifold , on which surgery is usually performed , is the @xmath0-sphere , @xmath3 , which may be viewed as @xmath4 with all points at infinity compactified to one single point .",
    "we also need to recall that the basic connected , oriented @xmath0-manifold with boundary is the solid @xmath0-ball , @xmath5 .",
    "in particular for @xmath6 , other 3-manifolds with boundary that we will be using are : the solid torus , which can be described as the product set @xmath7 , and the handlebodies , which generalize the solid torus , having higher genus .",
    "we are particularly interested in situations related to 2- and 3-dimensional topological surgery of the attracting type . here , a _ `",
    "drilling ' process _ along the invisible thread seems to be initiated , resulting in passage from spherical to toroidal shape . `",
    "drilling ' with coiling seems to be a natural choice in various physical processes , probably for being the most effective way for opening up a hole .    from the above",
    ", topological surgery is not just a mathematical technique used for changing the homeomorphism type of a manifold .",
    "it can also serve as a mathematical tool for explaining the change of topology in many natural phenomena .",
    "for this reason we introduce dynamics in the process of surgery .    in sections  1 , 2 and 3",
    "we recall first the mathematical definitions of topological surgery in dimensions 1 , 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "then , we introduce dynamics in topological surgery distinguishing two different types : via _ attracting forces _ and via _ repelling forces _ between two selected points , the ` poles ' .",
    "each one of these two types of dynamics can be eventually viewed as the reverse of the other .",
    "we also introduce the notions of _ solid 1- and 2-dimensional surgery _ , whereby the interior space is now filled in . also , the notions of _ truncated 1- , 2- and 3-dimensional surgery _ , whereby surgery is being localized .",
    "all these notions are better adapted to natural or physical processes exhibiting topological surgery and we address briefly in each dimension such examples .",
    "moreover , truncated 3-dimensional surgery allows to visualize 3-dimensional surgery , for which the fourth dimension is otherwise needed .",
    "this is presented in section  3 .",
    "finally , in section  4 we use all the new notions introduced in the previous sections in order to pinn down the relation among topological surgeries in dimensions 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the first author was always fascinated by 3-dimensional surgery and was trying to find ways to visualize it . so figure  [ 3dtruncated ] dates back several years ago .",
    "further , our work is inspired by our connection of 3-dimensional topological surgery with a dynamical system @xcite .",
    "then , on one hand we will have a mathematical model for 3-dimensional surgery . on the other hand , through our connection many natural phenomena can be modelled through our dynamical system .",
    "we hope that our observations , new definitions and ideas will serve in turn as inspiration for many more interesting connections .",

    "physical examples reminiscent of 2-dimensional surgery comprise the formation of whirls and the falaco solitons @xcite ( see figure  [ falaco ] ) .",
    "the other possibility of 2-dimensional surgery on the 2-sphere is the following : an annulus @xmath29 ( perhaps twisted a number of times ) is removed from @xmath25 and is replaced in the closure of the remaining manifold by two discs @xmath30 attached along the common boundary @xmath12 , resulting in two copies of @xmath25 .",

    "it is worth noting that this type of surgery applied on a torus is the reverse process of the attracting type .",

    "this creates , by passive reaction , a cylindrical ` necking ' in the middle , which eventually tears apart and new material , two discs , gets attached along the boundary @xmath12 .",
    "see figure  [ 2drepel ] .",
    "it is worth observing that the process of repelling 2-dimensional surgery in reverse time would mean that the initial surface comprises two copies of @xmath25 and there are two discs to be removed , one on each sphere , replaced by a cylinder , thus merging the two spheres into one .",
    "similarly , the process of attracting 2-dimensional surgery in reverse time would mean that the initial surface is the torus and there is a cylinder to be removed and replaced by two discs , thus yielding back the 2-sphere .",

[ [ section-5 ] ]    in some natural phenomena the object undergoing surgery is not a surface but three - dimensional .",
    "for this reason we introduce also here the notion of _ solid 2-dimensional surgery_. there are two types of solid 2-dimensional surgery on the @xmath31-ball , @xmath32 , analogous to the two types of 2-dimensional surgery .",

    "figure  [ 3dtruncatedinitial](a ) illustrates a @xmath72-torus knot on the boundary of @xmath60 .",
    "the solid torus @xmath59 is represented by the red surgery curve , which is assumed to pass by the point at infinity .",
    "note that , from the point of view of @xmath59 the above curve is a @xmath73-torus knot on the boundary of @xmath59 and it is illustrated in figure  [ 3dtruncatedinitial](b ) .",
    "this @xmath71-torus knot is the image of the meridian via @xmath68 , so it becomes a meridian in the new 3-manifold and therefore it now bounds a disc ; while the meridians of @xmath59 that were bounding discs before they do not any more . see figure  [ 3dinr3 ] .",
    "this exchange of roles can be clearly seen in the blue parallel curve ( left hand illustration ) turning into a blue meridional disc ( right hand illustration ) .",
    "so , after surgery , the layering of @xmath59 is via the discs bounded by the @xmath71-torus knots .",
    "this is where we need the fourth dimension to visualize 3-dimensional surgery .",
    "practically , before one could slide through a meridional disc in @xmath59 ( and could also cross the surgery curve ) , while after surgery , the only way to come closer to the surgery curve is by following the parallel @xmath71-torus knot .",
    "note that the new meridians can never reach the surgery curve .",
    "note that the appearance of the surgery line changes instantly the layering of the space from spheres to tori and initiates the instant creation of a simple closed curve @xmath61 , which is the core of the solid torus @xmath60 .",
    "[ duality ] there is an apparent duality and a natural exchange of roles of the two solid tori .",
    "therefore , the core curve of @xmath60 could be equally considered as the surgery curve .",
    "the above topological process is called _",
    "@xmath74-rational surgery along the unknot _ and starting from @xmath50 it results in the lens space @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , by a fundamental theorem of topology , every c.c.o . 3-manifold can be created from @xmath50 by performing surgery along a knot or link ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    3-dimensional surgery is much harder to visualize than lower - dimensional surgeries .",
    "a first step in this direction is to use the de - compactification of @xmath50 .",
    "so , we define _ topological surgery in _ @xmath52 .",
    "the only difference from the definition of surgery in @xmath50 is that the surgery curve is now an infinite line @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ 3dinr3 ] illustrates surgery in @xmath52 .",
    "note that this figure resembles very much the electromagnetic field excited by a current loop which is located in the innermost torus in the drawing .",
    "here there is no apparent drilling , that is , no obvious specified longitude , but by remark  [ duality ] the surgery curve is the core of the solid torus @xmath60 .",
    ".,width=529 ]    [ [ section-12 ] ]    a second step toward visualizing 3-dimensional surgery is achieved by removing a whole neighbourhood @xmath55 of the point at infinity . by remark",
    "[ truncate ] we are then left with a 3-ball @xmath32 , which is viewed as the solid torus @xmath60 corked by a ( bounded ) solid cylinder whose core is the arc @xmath43 , which is part of the surgery curve . a surgery in @xmath50 along an unknotted curve passing by the point at infinity would correspond to surgery in @xmath32 along the arc @xmath43 , the core of a solid cylinder .",
    "this solid cylinder is complemented by the outer ball @xmath55 , which is homeomorphic to another solid cylinder , to form together the solid torus @xmath59 . the above lead to the following ` localized ' definition of 3-dimensional surgery .",
    "a _ truncated 3-dimensional surgery _ in a 3-manifold @xmath1 is a 3-dimensional surgery , such that the surgery curve passes through the point at infinity , and such that a neighbourhood of the point at infinity is removed .",
    "this definition can help us visualize step - by - step 3-dimensional surgery along the unknot in @xmath50 , especially the formation of the new meridian in the resulting lens space .",
    "for this we shall consider for simplicity a @xmath75-torus knot as the specified parallel curve .",
    "view figure  [ 3dtruncated ] .",
    "we start with a solid cylinder , which is a part of the solid torus @xmath59 . on its boundary a @xmath75-curve ( blue )",
    "is specified which is parallel to the core curve ( red ) .",
    "then the solid cylinder gets thicker and it is transformed into a 3-ball .",
    "then opposite parts of the cylinder move inwardly and at the same time a twisting takes place that results in ` straightening ' of the parallel curve . then merging and recupling takes place resulting in a hole ; thus the solid cylinder is turned into a solid torus on which the blue curve bounds now a disc .",
    "note that the solid torus @xmath60 surrounding the initial solid cylinder is omitted in the figure .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    considering now life - like situations , we will proceed with inserting dynamics in truncated 3-dimensional surgery .",
    "this can help understand the topological mechanism behind some natural or physical phenomena .",
    "we start with the attracting type .",
    "consider two points in 3-space , surrounded by spherical neighbourhoods , say @xmath76 and @xmath77and assume that on these points strong attracting forces act .",
    "view figure  [ 3dattract ] . as a result ,",
    "a ` joining thread ' , say @xmath43 , is created between the two points and ` drilling ' along @xmath43 is initiated .",
    "the joining arc @xmath43 is seen as part of a simple closed curve @xmath62 passing by the point at infinity .",
    "this is the surgery curve .",
    "further , the two 3-balls @xmath76 and @xmath77 together with the space in between make up a solid cylinder , the ` cork ' ( cf .",
    "figure  [ s3ballstotori ] ) .",
    "let @xmath60 be a solid torus , which filled by the cork gives rise to a 3-ball @xmath32 , such that the centers of the two balls @xmath76 and @xmath77 lie on its boundary ( compare with figure  [ s3ballstotori ] ) .",
    "the process of attracting 3-dimensional surgery restricted in @xmath32 shall be called _ attracting truncated 3-dimensional surgery_.    note that the cork in the above definition is complemented by a solid cylinder , a tubular neighbourhood @xmath55 of the arc @xmath78 , to the solid torus @xmath59 , the complement of @xmath60 in @xmath50 .",
    "this completes our familiar picture .",
    "we shall then define _ repelling truncated 3-dimensional surgery _ to be the dual phenomenon to the above , whereby strong repelling forces are applied on the two points , so strong as to initiate attracting surgery in the complementary 3-ball @xmath55 , along the segment @xmath78 with central point the point at infinity .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    structural similarities exhibited on vastly different scales of the universe can be visualized and explained with 3-dimensional surgery . a natural phenomenon resembling strongly",
    "the process of truncated 3-dimensional surgery is the formation of tornadoes , see figure  [ tornado ] . namely , if certain meteorological conditions are met , funnel - shaped clouds start descending toward the ground . once they reach it , they become tornadoes . drawing the analogy to 3-dimensional surgery ,",
    "first the poles are chosen , one on the tip of the cloud and the other on the ground , and they seem to be joined through an invisible line .",
    "then , starting from the first point , the wind revolves in a helicoidal motion toward the second point , resembling ` hole drilling ' along the line until the hole is drilled .",
    "topologically speaking , in this case seems to be undergoing rational surgery along the unknot .        : http://www.smartsuburbansurvival.com/category/natural-disasters/tornadoes.dpbs and noaa ( http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/wea00308.htm ) [ tornado ]    there are other examples exhibiting topological behaviour of 3-dimensional surgery .",

    "note that solid 2-dimensional surgery can be almost viewed as the intermediate stage of 3-dimensional surgery .",
    "indeed , there is a great resemblance between solid 2-dimensional surgery and truncated 3-dimensional surgery .",
    "they both begin with a solid ball and there is ` drilling ' occuring along a ` cork ' , a solid cylinder passing through the center .",
    "in fact , by definition  [ continuum2d ] , the solid 2-dimensional surgery is responsible for the creation of the curve @xmath61 in truncated 3-dimensional surgery . yet",
    ", there is a crucial difference : in solid 2-dimensional surgery the cylindrical cork is removed afterwards and we left with just the solid torus @xmath60 with its core curve @xmath61 . while , in truncated 3-dimensional surgery , matter is still there ( surrounding the arc @xmath43 ) but it is completely altered .",
    "the above descriptions explain the connection between 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional topological surgery , up to now not so explicitly presented .",
    "the meeting ground is the three - space with solid 2-dimensional surgery on the one end and truncated 3-dimensional surgery on the other end .",
    "we shall now go a bit further than that and explain the connection of attracting surgeries in all three dimensions .",
    "view figure  [ crossections ] .",
    "on the left - hand top and bottom pictures we see truncated 3-dimensional surgery .",
    "taking on the top picture the intersection with the boundary of the 3-ball @xmath32 we pass to the initial picture of attracting 2-dimensional surgery , where two points with surrounding discs are specified . restricting truncated 3-dimensional surgery only to this sphere results in the final stage of attracting 2-dimensional surgery ( middle bottom illustration ) .",
    "taking finally the intersection with a meridional plane gives rise to 1-dimensional surgery ( rightmost illustrations ) .",
    "topological surgery occurs in numerous natural phenomena of varying scales where two points ( poles ) are selected and attracting or reppeling forces are applied . examples of such phenomena comprise : dna recombination , magnetic reconnection , mitosis , gene transfer , the creation of falaco solitons , the formation of whirls and tornadoes and magnetic fields .    in this paper we tried to pinn down the connection of such phenomena with topological surgery . in order to do this",
    "we first enhanced the static description of topological sugery of dimensions  1 , 2 and 3 by introducing dynamics by means of attracting or repelling forces between two ` poles ' .",
    "we then filled in the interior space in 1- and 2-dimensional surgery , introducing the notion of solid 1- and 2-dimensional surgery .",
    "this way more natural phenomena can be accommodated in the connection . finally we fitted many more natural phenomena in the connection by intoducing the notion of truncated 1- , 2- , and 3-dimensional topological surgery , whereby surgery is more localized .",
    "thus , instead of considering surgery as an abstract topological process , it can now be viewed as a property of many natural phenomena .    on the other hand , all these new notions enabled us understand and visualize 3-dimensional surgey and reveal the relation between topological surgeries in all three lower dimensions . in @xcite",
    "these notions are used for connecting 3-dimensional topological surgery with a dynamical system .",
    "then , phenomena related to 3-dimensional surgery could be modelled by this dynamical system .",
    "we hope that through this study , topology and dynamics of natural phenomena as well as topological surgery may now be better understood and that our connections will serve as ground for many more insightful observations ."
