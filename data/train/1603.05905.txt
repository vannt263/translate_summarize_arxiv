    "we adopt a different transformation : using the trigonometric identity , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the imaginary unit , the equilibrium equations of becomes @xmath27 to formulate the above system of equations as an algebraic system , we let @xmath28 for all @xmath23 . with this substitution",

    "problem for systems of polynomial equations .",
    "a well known bound on the root count of a system of polynomial equations is the _ bzout bound _ which is simply the product of the degrees of all the equations . in the example shown in ,",
    "since each of the four equations is quadratic ( degree 2 ) , the highest possible number of isolated solutions as given by the bzout bound is therefore @xmath34 . in general , the bzout bound for the system ( [ equ : kuramoto - poly ] ) is @xmath35 .",
    "the bzout bound is a basic result in _ intersection theory _",
    "@xcite . based on this theory ,",
    "a more refined root count can be derived for the equilibrium equations for .",
    "this was first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in which it was shown to be the binomial coefficient @xmath36 , which will be referred to as the _ binomial bound_. ) was termed as a special case of the power flow equations .",
    "later on , the same binomial bound was proposed for the complete power flow equations @xcite ( see @xcite for an alternative proof for this bound ) . ]      in this subsection , we briefly review the bernstein  khovanskii  kushnirenko ( bkk ) bound @xcite for the number of isolated nonzero complex solutions which is a refinement of the bzout bound that takes into consideration the monomials that appear in the polynomial system : given a polynomial , each of its terms give rise to an _",
    "exponent vector_. for instance , for the term @xmath37 , the exponent vector is simply the vector whose entries are the exponents of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "the choice of this ordering is inconsequential as long as it is kept the same for each equation .",
    "the set of all exponent vectors derived from the nonzero terms of an polynomial equation is called the _ support _ of that equation .",
    "for example , if we arrange the variables in the order of @xmath41 , then the supports of the four equations in are    @xmath42    a _ convex set _ is a set of points in which the line segment connecting any pair of points in the set also lie in that set .",
    "the _ convex hull _ of a set is the minimal convex set containing that set . for a polynomial",
    ", the convex hull of its support is known as the _ newton polytope _ of that polynomial . in the study of convex polytopes ,",
    "the _ mixed volume _ of several polytopes is an important concept . in the simplest case ,",
    "the mixed volume of two line segments on the plane is precisely the area of the parallelogram spanned by translations of these two line segments .",
    "the general definition is included in the appendix .",
    "bernstein s theorem  @xcite provides an upper bound for the number solutions to a system of polynomial equations in terms of mixed volume :    given a system of @xmath43 polynomial equations in @xmath43 variables , the number of isolated complex solutions for which no variable is zero is bounded above by the mixed volume of the newton polytopes of the equations .",
    "this upper bound is known as the bkk bound , after a circle of closely related works by bernstein@xcite , kushnirenko@xcite , and khovanskii@xcite .",
    "recall that via the change of variables given in , each ( real ) equilibrium of corresponds to a unique nonzero complex solution of .",
    "therefore the bkk bound given above provides an upper bound to the number of isolated ( real ) equilibria .",
    "a crucial fact is that the bkk bound is _ generically exact _ : when the coefficients in the polynomial system are chosen at random , _ with probability one _ the number of isolated complex solutions for which no variable is zero is exactly the bkk bound . in the polynomial formulation of the kuramoto model given in , if certain relations are imposed on the coefficients ( e.g. , the coefficients of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in must be the same ) the generic exactness still holds true with a mild additional condition :    if there exists a choice of @xmath2 s and @xmath46 s for which the number of nonzero complex solutions of is the bkk bound , then for almost all choices of complex @xmath2 s and @xmath46 , the number of nonzero complex solutions of will be the bkk bound .    in other words , among the systems for all possible choices of the @xmath2 s and @xmath46 s , if the bkk bound is attainable then it must also be generically exact . in the following",
    ", we shall compute the bkk bound for the polynomial system induced by a number of graphs .",
    "then , the attainability and hence the generic exactness of the bkk bound in each case is verified by solving the system for some specific chosen set of @xmath2 s and @xmath46 s .",
    "in this section , we provide results for the kuramoto model on different graphs .",
    "we compare the bkk bound for both formulations ( [ eq : sincos ] ) and ( [ equ : kuramoto - poly ] ) with the help of the computational packages _ hom4ps-3.0 _",
    "@xcite and _ bertini _  @xcite .",
    "we also compare the bounds with the corresponding binomial bound .    to analyze how tight the above mentioned bounds are we provide results from our numerical experiments using the nphc method .",
    "the nphc method guarantees that one will obtain all isolated complex solutions for a system of polynomial equations by following the strategy as briefly explained below@xcite : to solve a system of polynomial equations , one starts with an upper bound on the number of complex solutions of the system .",
    "then , another system is created such that the system has exactly the same number of complex solutions as the upper bound , and it is easy to solve .",
    "finally , each solution of this new system is evolved over a single parameter towards the system to be solved .",
    "the so - called gamma - trick is employed to ensure to achive all the isolated complex solutions of the system .",
    "the complete graph is a graph in which each node is connected to all other nodes .",
    "hence , this is the most densely connected graph .",
    "we compare the bzout bound , binomial bound , the bkk bound for the traditional polynomial formulation ( [ eq : sincos ] ) , the bkk bound for the new formulation ( [ equ : kuramoto - poly ] ) , and the actual number of complex solutions ( with 100 random samples for each graph ) in table [ tab : complete ] .",

    "in this article , we have translated the stationary equations of the kuramoto model to the polynomial form in a different way than the traditional polynomial formulation to utilize complex algebraic geometry results .",
    "we have considered a general form of the kuramoto model , i.  e.  , with arbitrary natural frequencies and on graphs with arbitrary weights .",
    "we then provide a prescription to compute a tight upper bound , called the bkk bound , on the number of equilibria of the model for a given graph topology , i.e. , the bound captures the graph topology accurately .",
    "we first reproduced the previously available upper bound , @xmath36 , by computing the bkk bound for the complete graph with arbitrary ( and inhomogeneous ) coupling strengths and natural frequencies : the binomial bound is the tightest possible bound for the kuramoto model on the complete graph .",
    "the previous upper bound , however , does not take into account the sparsity of the graphs unlike ours . for other sparser graphs such as path graphs , ring graphs and erds - rnyi random graphs ,",
    "the bkk bound for the new polynomial formulation is significantly lower than the binomial bound as well as the bkk bound for the traditional polynomial formulation .",
    "furthermore , with extensive numerical experiments with the nphc method , which guarantees to find all isolated complex solutions of systems of polynomial equations , we find that for generic natural frequencies and weights the number of complex solutions is always equal to the bkk bound of the new polynomial formulation .",
    "hence , this is the best possible _ _ u__pper bound on the number of complex solutions for _ _ g__eneric values of natural frequencies and inhomogeneous couplings .",
    "our prescription is also constructive in solving the stationary equations of the model in that we not only provide the tight - most upper bound but also the optimum way of constructing a starting system for the nphc method . because our numerical experiments suggest that the bkk bound is always equal to the number of complex solutions for generic parameter values , no path diverges in the nphc computation .",
    "this tight upper bound not only helps the nphc method to solve the correpsonding systems more efficiently , but it also provides a concrete stopping criterion to other stochastic nonlinear equation solving method . our results also give rise to the following interesting and mathematically challenging questions : can there be some values of @xmath2 s and @xmath47 s so that the number of real equilibria attains the bkk bound for the given graph ? if not , what is the maximum number of real solutions a particular graph can have ? though there are a few algebraic geometry based methods@xcite have been developed to answer such questions , they can not yet deal with systems beyond simple ones .",
    "moreover , it will also be interesting to investigate how the number of complex and real equilibria behave for non - generic values of the couplings and frequencies .",
    "we plan to study all these issues in future .    in the future , we plan to explore the advantages and disadvantages of both polynomial formulations in terms of the numerical stability , ease to implement , and so on .",
    "systems with sine and cosine of angles and difference of angles are not unique to the kuramoto model , and hence such a comparative analysis can have far reaching implications .",
    "we also point out a remarkable parallel between upper bounds for the equilibria of the kuramoto model and those for the equilibria of the complete power flow equations @xcite .",
    "we plan to quantitatively establish this similarity in the future .    given @xmath43 convex polytopes @xmath48 and positive real numbers @xmath49 minkowski s theorem @xcite states that the @xmath43-dimensional volume of the _ minkowski sum _",
