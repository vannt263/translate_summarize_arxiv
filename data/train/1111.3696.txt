    "iterative decoding of block low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes , despite its known strength , fails to achieve the same limits as the optimum maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding .",
    "it has been shown , however  @xcite , and then rigorously proved  @xcite , that iterative decoding thresholds of convolutional ( or spatially coupled ) ldpc codes coincide with the ml decoding thresholds .",
    "a coupled code is constructed by copying the protograph of an initial block code a number of times and then connecting the neighboring copies to form a chain .",
    "the graphs located at the ends of the chain contain variable nodes with fewer constraints , since these graphs are connected to their neighbors from only one side . as a result",
    ", iterative decoding progress initiates at the ends of the chain , due to the effect of the slight irregularity , and then propagates through the entire chain .",
    "the principle of spatial graph coupling has proven to be applicable to several other areas , including multiple user detection , compressive sensing , and quantum coding .    in this paper , we focus our attention on spatial graph coupling in relation to multiple access communications . the capacity and the achievable rate region for the multiple access channel ( mac )",

    "the corner points of the rate region polytope can be achieved by successive ( onion peeling ) decoding  @xcite while the middle part is achieved by rate splitting and/or time sharing added to the onion peeling  @xcite .",
    "however , communication approaches that allow for more robust and less complex joint parallel detection / decoding , such as code - division multiple access ( cdma ) , have had limited success in achieving the inner points of the mac rate region .",
    "the equal power user case is typically the most difficult , since all users happen to be operating under same conditions , and there is no structural irregularity to initiate the decoding convergence . it has been shown that regular random cdma can only support a fixed system load is defined as the ratio of the number of supported users @xmath0 to the number of available signal dimensions @xmath1 ( or chips in cdma ) , i.e , @xmath2 . ]",

    "we consider a multiple access multiuser situation where each user modulates his signal as a sum of redundant , independent , equal power , data streams , as described in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the modulated signal allows for sparse graph representation similar to the ldpc code s tanner graph .",
    "the sparse graphs of the transmitted signals couple together `` in the air , '' and the receiver observes a coupled sequence of graphs which is later processed by an iterative detector / decoder . we focus on a communication scenario in which all users transmit an equal number of equal power bpsk data streams that are encoded by error correction codes optimal for the binary input additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel .",
