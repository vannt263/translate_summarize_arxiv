    "we present a determination of the the fundamental properties of o - type stars in order to provide a solid basis for understanding the evolution of massive stars forming today or long ago , and for determining the properties of unresolved starbursts both near and far .",
    "a knowledge of a star s mass , luminosity , and effective temperature is essential for understanding the evolution of massive stars , the initial mass function , and ages and properties of clusters and regions .",
    "the fundamental properties of o - type stars are also essential for interpreting the spectra of unresolved star - forming regions and of starburst galaxies .",
    "most efforts to synthesize the spectra of starburst galaxies use observed spectra of relatively nearby stars as templates .",
    "however , even these so - called empirical methods involve a calibration of spectral type in terms of fundamental stellar parameters ( e.g. mass , effective temperature , bolometric luminosity ) and then a subsequent calibration of these parameters in terms of initial mass and age via a comparison with evolutionary tracks .",
    "there are already several spectral calibrations in general use today .",
    "one is by vacca et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which is based on spectral analyses of galactic o stars carried out in the 1980 s .",
    "another , which has been incorporated in the starburst99 code of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , uses the spectral calibration of schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) . in the last twenty years",
    ", great strides have been taken in increasing the quality of the observed spectra and in increasing the physical realism of model atmospheres and spectra .",
    "our work takes advantage of both advances .",
    "we make use of the high - quality , high - resolution spectra of o - type stars in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( @xmath1 ) . in this respect",
    ", we are extending the recent studies of selected types of o stars ( e.g. o  supergiants : @xcite , o  dwarfs : @xcite .",
    "our study encompasses 17 stars in the smc that are well distributed in spectral type and luminosity class while homogeneous in metallicity .",
    "the breadth of the sample enables us to evaluate the sensitivity of optical and ultraviolet spectral features to temperature , gravity , and microturbulence ( @xmath2 )    to interpret these spectra , we use the new , fully line - blanketed nlte model atmospheres and spectra calculated by lanz & hubeny ( 2003 ) ( @xmath3 .",
    "we paid particular attention to blanketing by metal lines on the structure of the atmosphere and emergent spectrum .",
    "we find that back - warming of the atmosphere produced by the millions of metal lines ",
    "all treated in nlte  not only affects the metal - line spectrum but also the helium lines , leading to a lower lower ( i.e. normal ) helium abundance in o - type stars and a lower temperature scale ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the lower temperature scale translates to lower the bolometric corrections , bolometric luminosities , and ionizing fluxes . a new calibration of ionizing luminosities with spectral type is presented in  6.4 .",
    "including the myriad of metal lines in our models brings other benefits as well .",
    "the most obvious is the expanded set of spectral diagnostics in the ultraviolet , which is replete with metal lines .",
    "a less obvious benefit is the high level of internal consistency of the model spectrum : ionization balance of helium , iron , and carbon now yield the same effective temperature ; and helium singlets now give the same results as the helium triplets .",
    "we find that the temperature scale depends on metallicity .",
    "based on tlusty models , o - type stars of solar metallicity are about 1,000 to 2,000 k cooler than smc o stars of the same spectral type .",
    "we also find that luminosity class is more closely correlated with the ratio of luminosity to spectroscopic mass than it is to bolometric luminosity .",
    "however , spectroscopic mass is often lower than the mass derived from a star s position on the hr diagram  a circumstance known as the `` mass discrepancy '' .",
    "we find that the mass discrepancy is generally greatest for stars whose atmospheres are highly enriched in nitrogen .",
    "both anomalies  the low spectroscopic masses and high nitrogen abundances  can be explained if the stars are rapid rotators @xcite .",
    "conclusions are presented in @xmath5 .",
    "the program stars in this study are the same as those selected for an ultraviolet spectroscopic survey of o - type stars with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _",
    "( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) ( hst go program 7437 , lennon = pi ) .",
    "this survey targeted 17 o - type stars in the small magellanic cloud for ultraviolet spectroscopy .",
    "the resultant ultraviolet spectra along with optical spectra obtained at ground - based telescopes are displayed in an atlas of o - type stars in the small magellanic cloud constructed by @xcite .",
    "we selected o - type stars in the small magellanic cloud because of the known distance , low metallicity , and generally low reddening of this nearby satellite galaxy . in this study , we adopt a distance , @xmath6 kpc , or equivalently , a distance modulus , @xmath7 , in agreement with recent determinations based on cepheids [ @xmath8 , groenewegen 2000 ; @xmath9 , kovcs 2000 ] and the tip of the red giant branch [ @xmath10 , cioni et  al .",
    "because the program stars are at the same distance , we can examine the correspondence between luminosity class and bolometric luminosity .",
    "the low metallicity of the smc ( @xmath11 ; venn 1999 ; bouret et  al .",
    "2003 ) makes it an ideal surrogate for star - forming galaxies at high redshift , which generally have a low metal content .",
    "the low metallicity also gives us a practical benefit : the winds of o - type stars in the smc , which are driven by radiation pressure in metal lines , are particularly weak , so that our approach of photospheric analysis is justified .",
    "the program stars form an unbiased sample of smc o - type stars except that they were chosen for their narrow - lined spectra in order to avoid problems with line - blending in the analysis .",
    "since o stars tend to be rapid rotators , this one bias means that we are viewing the stars pole - on .",
    "the observational data include not only the stis and ground - based optical spectra of 17 program stars ( walborn et  al .",
    "2000 ) , but also far - uv spectra ( 905 - 1187 ) from the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) for 9 of the program stars .",
    "the fuse data broaden the uv spectral coverage to 905 - 1700  and enable better temperature determinations through ionization balance of elements such as c , n , si , and s. table  [ startab ] lists the program stars , their spectral types @xcite , the observatory at which the optical spectrograms were obtained , and the availability of stis or fuse spectra . our sample contains two more stars , ngc  346 mpg  487 and mpg  682 , than walborn et  al.s because stis spectroscopy of these stars was secured at a later date .",
    "we examined each of the stis target - acquisition images , which consists of a @xmath12 picture obtained with a wide - band , red filter ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "none of the targets appears to be multiple . of course",
    ", at a 2-pixel resolution of @xmath14 , a target - acquisition image can not resolve systems whose separations are less than 6300 au , so this was not a stringent test .",
    "we also checked that the target - acquisition sequence found the right star .",
    "we found that stis failed to acquire ngc 346 mpg 682 , in that the initial field was blank .",
    "when this happens , the acquisition software still tries to center the brightest spot in the image ( undoubtedly a cosmic - ray hit ) and repeats the sequence of taking an image and centering .",
    "we found that the ( unknown ) star that was actually observed was hotter than would be expected from its optical spectrum , so we concluded that the wrong star was observed .",
    "acquisition of ngc 346 mpg 12 may have also failed , but since the stis and eso spectra of ngc 346 mpg 12 lead to the same spectral classification , we retained the stis spectrum of this star for further analysis .    both stis and optical data and data - processing are described in detail by walborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . here",
    ", we only describe the fuse observations .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , for a description of the fuse instrument and performance .",
    "all publicly available fuse spectra of the program stars were obtained with the star placed in the lwrs ( @xmath15 ) aperture .",
    "for the majority of targets , the starfield is sufficiently sparse that the target was the dominant star in the field of view .",
    "however , lwrs spectra of stars in ngc 346 are clearly composite : they disagree with stis spectra in the region of overlap ( 1150 - 1187 ) .",
    "we therefore discarded them . in our cycle  2 fuse program",
    "b134 , we observed mpg  12 using the mdrs ( @xmath16 ) aperture to avoid the crowding problem .",
    "however , the resulting spectral coverage was limited because of the imperfect alignment of fuse optical channels .",
    "accordingly , we only used data obtained in the lif channels , covering the range 990 - 1187 .",
    "a fuse spectrum is recorded in eight segments , which together cover the spectral region between 905 and 1187   at a resolving power , @xmath17 .",
    "we acquired the raw data segments from the multi - mission archive at space telescope ( mast ) and reprocessed the data using the calfuse ( v2.0.5 ) reduction software .",
    "we next co - added multiple exposures , if any .",
    "we then registered , adjusted the flux levels , and combined the 8 spectral segments .",
    "finally , we registered and scaled the spectral flux to match the stis spectrum in the region of overlap ( 11501187 ) , which includes the @xmath181176 multiplet , which was used as a wavelength fiducial .",
    "the combined spectrum was binned to a 2-pixel resolving power , @xmath17 .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum is 15 - 20 per resolution element .",
    "we used the new , fully line - blanketed nlte model atmospheres and spectra of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ostar2002 ) .",
    "these model atmospheres cover the parameter range : 27,500k @xmath19@xmath0@xmath20k , with a sampling step of 2500k ; @xmath21 , down to the eddington limit with intervals of 0.25dex ; 10 metallicities , from metal - rich models ( twice the solar metallicity ) to extremely metal - poor models .",
    "all models in the grid have a normal helium abundance , he / h  =  0.1 by number density , and a microturbulent velocity , @xmath22kms@xmath23 .",
    "ostar2002 models relevant to the small magellanic cloud are the `` s '' models ( @xmath24 ) and the `` t '' models ( @xmath25 ) . if needed to achieve an overall match to observations , we interpolated logarithmically between model atmospheres for the chosen stellar parameters and then computed the spectrum of the interpolated model with synspec .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion comparing different interpolation strategies in the grid .",
    "we calculated the nlte model atmospheres with our computer code , tlusty , using the complete linearization / accelerated lambda iteration method @xcite .",
    "the program solves the basic structural equations in a plane - parallel geometry : radiative transfer , hydrostatic equilibrium , radiative equilibrium , statistical equilibrium , and charge and particle conservation .",
    "the critical ingredients of such models are the completeness of opacity sources and energy levels treated explicitly in the statistical equilibrium equations .",
    "the model atmospheres include the opacities of about 2 million lines dynamically selected from a list of 12 million lines , and they account for about 100,000 individual atomic levels of 45 ions .",
    "the spectrum is typically sampled at 180,000 to 200,000 frequencies .",
    "further information about the models , opacity distribution functions , and opacity sampling options to treat the line opacity of iron - peak elements is given in @xcite . finally , we calculated detailed spectra with our spectrum synthesis code , synspec , based on the atmospheric structure and nlte populations provided by tlusty .",
    "the reliability of the metal - line spectrum is highly dependent on the quality of the model atoms .",
    "since uv absorption lines tend to arise from ground - state or low - lying energy levels , the model atoms for those ions are thought to be quite reliable .",
    "they should also be adequate for higher energy levels involved in the formation of optical lines .",
    "the only exception is the model atom , which oversimplifies the very high energy levels and may therefore lead to an underestimate of the total recombination rates and , consequently , the optical recombination lines are predicted too weak @xcite .",
    "however , the net global error on the ionization level of carbon remains insignificant and , in any case , it can be checked through a comparison of the effective temperature derived from carbon ionization balance with temperatures derived from other elements .",
    "since o - type stars are known to have have strong , supersonic winds , the validity of static , photospheric models must be addressed . however , in low - metallicity stars like those in the smc , only a few strong resonance lines show the signature of a wind ; most lines are symmetric , indicating that they are formed in a quasi - static photosphere .",
    "even so , the hydrostatic density structure of the photosphere is complex because it is determined by the _ effective _ gravity , i.e. the newtonian gravity corrected for radiative acceleration due to the outward - directed force of radiation pressure .",
    "realistic models must account for all the lines , especially those in spectral regions of high flux .",
    "in fact , it is preferable to use sophisticated photospheric models such as the ostar2002 models for stars with moderate or weak winds rather than rely on `` unified '' ( photosphere+wind ) models with a simplified description of the deep , quasi - static layers .    to verify the validity of photospheric models as applied to smc o - type stars , we compared tlusty / synspec spectra to spectra computed with cmfgen , hillier and miller s ( 1998 ) code for `` unified '' models .",
    "like tlusty , cmfgen treats nlte line blanketing in detail and thus describes the photospheric structure with similar sophistication .",
    "we performed extensive comparisons in collaboration with john hillier , and both codes were upgraded in the process .",
    "we found that spectral lines formed in the inner region of the atmosphere show identical profiles in the cmfgen and tlusty / synspec spectra even for smc supergiants @xcite .",
    "[ however , static models are definitely inappropriate for wolf - rayet stars and for extreme supergiants , especially at high metallicities . ]",
    "previous studies show that absorption by numerous metal lines causes cooling at the surface and heating of the inner regions of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this back - warming effect raises the ionization level of many diagnostic spectral lines .",
    "figure  [ blankfig ] shows the effects of metal line - blanketing on the hydrogen and helium lines used for spectral classification and calibration .",
    "nlte line - blanketing produces only slightly narrower profiles of h@xmath26   @xcite thereby yielding marginally higher ( 0.05 to 0.1  dex ) surface gravities .",
    "its main effect is on effective temperature .",
    "@xmath184471 line is strengthened at temperatures below 40,000k but weakened above 40,000k .",
    "@xmath184542 is also strengthened by line blanketing at all temperatures , although less so at higher temperatures .",
    "the net result , shown in fig .",
    "[ whefig ] , is that line blanketing by metals produces a decrease of about 1000  3000k in @xmath0  derived from solar composition models compared to h - he models . at lower metallicities ,",
    "this systematic decrease in @xmath0 is smaller and is mostly found in hotter models .",
    "these results are in good agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "metal line - blanketing also affects the derived helium abundance . as shown in fig .",
    "[ whe2fig ] , both and lines are stronger in a line - blanketed model than in a pure h - he model having the same parameters , @xmath0  and @xmath27 . to match the observed strengths of @xmath184471 and @xmath184542 with a h - he model would require a higher gravity or a higher helium abundance .",
    "since the strength and profile of the gravity indicator , h@xmath26 , is unaffected by line blanketing , the higher - gravity solution is ruled out , and one would adopt an enhanced helium abundance . there is therefore good reason to be skeptical about the extent of enhancement in helium abundances in o - type stars if derived from pure h - he model atmospheres @xcite . and",
    "in fact , we derive normal helium abundances for all the program stars , even for those that are highly enriched in nitrogen .",
    "there are two types of spectral classification systems in use for o - type stars : a quantitative scheme devised by @xcite and @xcite based on the equivalent widths of h@xmath26 , @xmath184471 , and @xmath184542 ; and a qualitative scheme developed by @xcite , based on visual inspection of the h , he , and metal lines .",
    "both schemes estimate spectral type by the ratio of and line strengths , and luminosity class by the strength of stark - broadened wings of h@xmath26 ( walborn also makes use of various he lines as well ) . in this study , we adopt walborn et al.s ( 2000 ) classifications for the program stars . in any case , the two schemes usually agree to better than a spectral type , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spclsfig ] .",
    "the two exceptions are : av80 ( o4 - 6n(f)p ) , a rapidly rotating star whose line strengths are difficult to measure ; and ngc  346 mpg  682 ( o9-o9.5v ) , which has also been classified as o8v , in which case there is no disagreement .",
    "spectral classification becomes more difficult for stars embedded in nebulosity because of contamination from nebular emission lines .",
    "this is the case for some stars in ngc 346 .",
    "figure  [ nebfig ] , which compares the optical spectra of two stars in ngc  346 , illustrates the problem . @xcite classified the spectrum of ngc  346 mpg  324 as o4v because of its weak absorption lines .",
    "however , the lines may be weak because they are filled in by nebular emission . in cases such as this , we used the uv spectrum to check for consistency with the optical spectral type .",
    "if nebular emission is significant , we can only analyze the wings of the h and he line profiles . without reliable equivalent widths ,",
    "there is some uncertainty regarding rotational vs. pressure ( stark ) broadening of the h and he lines .",
    "this ambiguity is not serious in most cases since the rotational velocity , @xmath28 , can usually be estimated from the profile of the @xmath181176 multiplet . as shown in fig .",
    "[ vrotfig ] , individual components of the multiplet start to merge as @xmath28 increases . the profile of @xmath181176 is a useful diagnostic at all rotational velocities seen in our sample , from @xmath29kms@xmath23   or less ( ngc  346 mpg  487 ) to @xmath30kms@xmath23   or more ( av 80 ) .",
    "other reasons to expand the list of lines for spectral analysis from just the three strong h and he lines are to check for consistency and to make finer distinctions . fig .",
    "[ avhefig ] compares the helium spectrum of av83 ( o7iaf+ ) and av69 ( oc7.5iii ) . despite their different spectral classifications ,",
    "the line strengths of @xmath314471 ( a triplet ) and @xmath314542 are identical , and our models indicate that the two stars have similar effective temperatures , @xmath0  @xmath3235,000k",
    ". however , the singlet lines are different in the two spectra : they are strong in av69 but almost absent in av83 .",
    "our models , which match both the singlet and triplet lines of , indicate that this difference is due to the higher surface gravity of av69 ( @xmath33 ) than in av83 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "singlets respond differently from triplets to non - lte effects on the level populations because of the different structure of their energy levels ( singlet lines are connected to the ground level of helium , whereas the lowest triplet level is metastable ) .",
    "because of its lower gravity ( lower atmospheric density ) , non - lte effects are stronger in the spectrum of av83 . the weaker stark - broadened wings of the balmer lines and the strong emission of @xmath314686 provide consistency checks for the lower gravity of av83 .",
    "as discussed above , we made full use of hydrogen and helium lines in the optical spectrum for calibration .",
    "however , because of problems with nebular masking of lines ( fig .",
    "[ nebfig ] ) , we also use lines of heavier elements for estimating temperature .",
    "below , we describe how optical and uv metal lines can be used as supporting evidence on @xmath0 .    most metal lines in the optical spectral region",
    "can appear in either absorption or emission .",
    "these `` of emission lines '' include @xmath314058 , @xmath314088 , 4116 , @xmath314634 - 41 , @xmath314647 - 51 , and @xmath314486 , 4503 .",
    "there is observational and theoretical evidence that the emission is due to non - lte effects ( overpopulation of the upper level of a transition ) rather than to emission in an extended atmosphere . as shown in fig .",
    "[ n34tfig ] , our plane - parallel models with @xmath35 show noticeable @xmath314058 emission at @xmath36k if n = n@xmath37 ; @xmath314634 - 41 emission occurs at @xmath38k if n@xmath39 n@xmath37 ; but @xmath314088 , 4116 emission occurs only at very high temperatures ( @xmath40k ) and then , only weakly .",
    "however , before we can use these lines to make reliable estimates of @xmath0  and abundances , we must first improve the treatment of dielectronic recombination as well as the model atoms , because these lines involve highly - excited energy levels .",
    "we therefore directed our attention to the uv metal lines , which provide useful supporting material for temperature estimation , especially for those stars whose and lines are masked by nebular emission .",
    "[ c34fig ] illustrates the case of the carbon ionization balance . while both @xmath311175 and @xmath311169 grow stronger with increased gravity , higher carbon abundance and microturbulent velocity ,",
    "the ratio of line strengths is most sensitive to temperature , so the effective temperature can be estimated with reasonable accuracy , although there is a small offset toward higher temperatures ( @xmath41k ) if a nebular carbon abundance is assumed . despite its successes , uv",
    "metal lines can not be the primary and only means of estimating effective temperature because the ionization level of an element depends on gravity as well as temperature ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "contrary to the optical spectrum , gravity can not be derived in the uv from the lyman lines because they are masked by interstellar absorption .",
    "the main objection to photospheric analysis is that photospheric lines strong enough to be measured may already be saturated . to investigate this possibility , we computed a set of model uv spectra over the temperature range , @xmath0 = 30,000  50,000k , for @xmath43 and @xmath44kms@xmath23 .",

    "the range of @xmath0  over which a spectral is sensitive to temperature is listed for models with @xmath43 . at lower gravity ,",
    "the temperatures are about 2000k higher .",
    "as expected , resonance lines of abundant elements like @xmath311549 are insensitive to temperature because they are saturated .",
    "some subordinate lines , such as @xmath311169 and @xmath311502 , are not useful temperature indicators by themselves because their strength does not change monotonically with @xmath0 , although they can be used for ionization balance ( see fig .",
    "[ c34fig ] ) .",

    "[ avhefig ] , the differences in line strengths are mainly the result of different surface gravities .",
    "fortunately , the / ratio is nearly independent of gravity ( fig .",
    "[ c34fig ] ) .",
    "the iron ionization level is also a good indicator of temperature of o - type stars : lines are strong in late o stars , dominates in mid - o - type spectra , and lines are present in early - o spectra ( see fig .",
    "9 of lanz & hubeny 2003 ) . to investigate the effect of gravity on the iron ionization balance , we take advantage of the numerous and lines in the ultraviolet to construct an ionization index ,    @xmath47    by using equivalent widths , we account automatically for differences in the continuum of different models .",

    "the range of gravities in early - o stars is however limited ; moreover , the integrated contribution of lines in the @xmath451250 - 1300 range remains small ( see fig .",
    "10r ) making the definition of a sensitive index difficult .",
    "the case of iron ionization illustrates well the potential of using lines from different species to determine the stellar parameters .",
    "for instance , the resonance lines are also known to be sensitive to luminosity @xcite . matching the full",
    "uv and optical spectrum provides additional checks and reliability that analyses based on h and he lines only lack .",
    "a crucial ingredient , however , is an extensive treatment of nlte line blanketing  as incorporated in tlusty and cmfgen models  to ensure that ionization balance of heavier elements is predicted accurately .",
    "`` microturbulence '' was first invoked by @xcite to explain the large doppler widths of lines seen in supergiant spectra .",
    "although a useful device for matching observed line strengths , microturbulence plays havoc with abundance determinations .",
    "as @xcite warned , photospheric models ignoring the presence of an atmospheric velocity gradient may require significantly higher microturbulent velocities to achieve the same equivalent widths .",
    "velocity fields are essential for determining abundances of weak ` pseudophotospheric ' metal lines in relatively dense winds in which these lines are formed around the sonic point . in less dense stellar winds , as those observed in smc o stars , metal lines are formed deeper in the quasi - static photosphere . using cmfgen wind models , and thus accounting for the velocity field , we had nevertheless to adopt microturbulent velocities between 5 and 20kms@xmath23  to match the observed strength of uv metal lines @xcite .",
    "the effect of microturbulence can be seen in the left panel of fig .",

    "[ tcompfig ] , the current scatter in the results makes hardly possible to reach a conclusion about a systematic difference between galactic ( filled symbols ) and smc ( open symbols ) stars and , therefore , to offer a quantitative relation tying the temperature scale to metallicity  which would be a great help for studies of the first generations of massive stars .",
    "we are extending our analysis based on cmfgen and tlusty models to a significant sample of galactic stars for providing the adequate comparison sample in order to arrive to a fully satisfactory conclusion . until then , and because of the consistency of the results derived from cmfgen wind models and tlusty photospheric models , as well as our comprehensive analysis of the various spectral diagnoses , we recommend to use the present results as the temperature calibration for low metallicity o stars ( table  [ calib1tab ] ) .",

    "no indications of surface helium enrichment are found in this sample , agreeing with the predictions of stellar evolution models that account for the effects of rotation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "only three of the program stars show nitrogen abundances as low as the smc nebular value , n / n@xmath128 . we adopt this value as the initial abundance relative to which we evaluate the nitrogen enrichment of the other stars .",

    "there is no clear evidence that the n / c ratio increases with evolution away from the zams , or with effective temperature or luminosity .",
    "conversely , stars with near - identical parameters may have very different surface compositions .",
    "for example , the three stars , av  83 , av  69 , and av  47 , have similar parameters but show a wide range of n / c ratios ( table 4 ) .",
    "hence , evolution alone can not explain the observed n / c ratios and , indeed , classical ( non - rotating ) stellar evolution models do not predict any nitrogen enrichment during the main - sequence stage . on the other hand , nitrogen enrichment @xmath130 predicted in models with rotationally - induced mixing .",
    "furthermore , @xcite convincingly argued that av  83 is a fast rotator while av  69 is most likely a slow rotator .",

    "this disagreement is known as the `` mass discrepancy '' and has been explored in detail observationally by @xcite in their studies of galactic stars .",

    "[ lumsect ] , the newtonian gravity is lowered by radiation pressure and centrifugal acceleration . as @xcite suggested , rotation is the root cause of the mass discrepancy .",
    "model atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium only account for radiation pressure plus gas pressure to balance gravity , so spectroscopic masses are correct only if the centrifugal acceleration is negligible , that is , only for slow rotators .",
    "otherwise , spectrum analyses yield underestimates of stellar mass .",
    "since the surfaces of rapidly rotating stars are enriched in nitrogen , we should expect the largest nitrogen enhancements in stars with the most severe mass discrepancies . in fig .",
    "[ massfig ] , we plotted stars with different symbols depending on the measured nitrogen enrichment . however , the success of this test is limited , in part because of the large error bars on the spectroscopic masses ( typically , @xmath136 ) and of the small number of stars showing the original composition .",
    "revisiting this expected relation using a larger stellar sample should be very helpful to improve our understanding of the effects of rotation .",
    "we can not correct the spectroscopic masses for rotation , because we do not know the actual rotation rates ( we only have access to @xmath59 ) .",
    "however , the problem may be turned around and we can use the mass discrepancy as a way to estimate the rotation rates . using the relations in  [ lumsect ] and requiring the two mass estimates to be identical , we derive rotational velocities in the range from 200 to 400kms@xmath23 .",
    "all but one star in our sample have low apparent rotational velocities ( @xmath137kms@xmath23 , see table  [ resutab ] ) .",
    "preferentially , stars in our sample are thus viewed pole - on .",
    "it remains , however , unclear at this point if this is or not a significant bias .",
    "for instance , we do not know if the polar and equatorial regions are homogeneously enriched",
    ". however , the derived rotation rates are not close enough to the break - up velocity to significantly affect the shape of the stars and , consequently , introduce a bias in the determination of effective temperatures .",
    "the program stars cover the full range of luminosity classes , from class v stars to extreme supergiants ( av  83 , o7iaf+ ) . nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ hrncfig ] shows that all but the two coolest stars ( av  327 , av  170 ) fall between the zams and the tams in the hr diagram . allowing for rotation ( cooler tams ) ,",
    "all stars are thus in the stage of core hydrogen burning .",
    "a timescale argument excludes all stars to be at a later evolutionary stage ( looping back to the blue ) .",
    "in particular , because 75% of the program stars show a moderate or strong nitrogen enhancement , this enrichment needs to occur during the main sequence phase and can not be delayed to post - main sequence phases .",
    "as discussed above , models with rotation indeed predict nitrogen enrichment during the main sequence phase .",
    "stellar ages have been determined by interpolating between isochrones ( fig .",

    "seven of the program stars are members of ngc  346 , the largest region in the smc .",
    "our age estimates are consistent with bouret et  al.s ( 2003 ) and show a spread between 1 and 8  myr .",
    "we note that this spread is increased by our lower effective temperatures ( using vacca et  al.s @xmath0  scale , the age of mpg  355 would not change while the age of the later o stars would be smaller ) .",

    "av  327 is about 6  myr old .",
    "we derive slightly greater ages only for three other stars ( av  170 , mpg  12 , and mpg  682 ) , but they are significantly less massive ( @xmath138 compared to @xmath139 for av  327 ) . as discussed in  [ cnsect ] , all other stars show their original carbon , oxygen , and helium composition . as pointed out by @xcite , models with rotation",

    "on the other hand , temperatures derived from uv metal lines with wm - basic @xcite are systematically cooler by 2000 to 6000k compared to all other recent studies . given the differences between models , analysis methodology , and the scatter at given spectral types between current results , we believe that a reliable quantitative estimate of the effect of metallicity on the effective temperature calibration still requires additional work . in particular , we have started a similar analysis of a large sample of galactic stars with tlusty and cmfgen .",
    "this study as well as massey et  al.s analysis of their complete sample currently under way will form appropriate bases for comparison with the results presented in this paper .    as a consequence of lower effective temperatures , we derive lower ionizing luminosities ( typically by a factor of 3 ) , implying a significant downward revision of previous relations of ionizing luminosities with spectral type .",
    "we provide a new calibration of the ionizing luminosities of o stars , which is only weakly dependent on metallicity .",

    "additionally , we derive for all stars ( but one ) a present metallicity of one fifth the solar value , in good agreement with other recent studies . in the few cases where nitrogen surface abundance has not yet been affected by mixing",
    ", we also obtain cno abundances consistent with earlier nebular studies .",
    "finally , our analysis of uv metal lines indicate that nlte metal line blanketed model atmospheres still require a significant microturbulence to match the strength of the observed uv lines .",
    "the required microturbulent velocity might decrease from early to late o stars .",
    "we stress that cmfgen wind models also require similar microturbulent velocities , which thus are not a spurious result from static model atmospheres .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive analysis of high - resolution , far - ultraviolet hst / stis , fuse , and optical spectra of 17 o stars in the small magellanic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the ostar2002 grid of nlte metal line - blanketed model atmospheres calculated with our nlte model atmosphere code tlusty . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically explore and present the sensitivity of various uv and optical lines to different stellar parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained consistent fits of the uv and the optical spectrum to derive the effective temperature , surface gravity , surface composition , and microturbulent velocity of each star . </S>",
    "<S> stellar radii , masses , luminosities and ages then follow directly . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to recent but more limited studies , we derive cooler temperatures than the standard effective temperature calibration of o stars . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new calibration between the spectral type and effective temperature based on our results from uv metal lines as well as optical hydrogen and helium lines . for stars of the same spectral subtype </S>",
    "<S> , we find a general good agreement between @xmath0determinations obtained with tlusty , cmfgen , and fastwind models . </S>",
    "<S> the lower effective temperatures translate into lower bolometric corrections and lower ionizing fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> we derive ionizing luminosities that are smaller by a factor of 3 compared to luminosities inferred from previous standard calibrations . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical composition analysis reveals that the surface of about 3/4 of the program stars is moderately to strongly enriched in nitrogen , while showing the original helium , carbon , and oxygen abundances . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the new stellar evolution models that predict that the surface of fast rotating stars becomes nitrogen - rich during the main sequence phase because of rotationally - induced mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , enrichment factors ( up to a factor of 40 ) that are larger than predicted by stellar evolution models . </S>",
    "<S> most stars exhibit the `` mass discrepancy '' problem , that is , the spectroscopic masses are lower than the evolutionary masses . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this discrepancy as a result of fast rotation which lowers the measured effective gravity . </S>",
    "<S> nitrogen enrichment and low spectroscopic masses are therefore two manifestations of fast rotation . </S>",
    "<S> our study thus emphasizes the importance of rotation in our understanding of the properties of massive stars and provides a framework for investigating populations of low metallicity massive stars at low and high redshifts . </S>"
