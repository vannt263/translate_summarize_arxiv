    "the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction problem has a well deserved reputation of being a difficult one ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one obvious reason may be found in the theoretical and experimental inaccessibility of the shortest distance interaction region relevant to nuclear physics .",
    "this lack of fundamental knowledge might be remedied in the future by _ ab initio _ lattice calculations , for which some incipient results exist already  @xcite .",
    "however , the current situation does not prevent from addressing many facets of nn interactions , particularly long distance features , provided short distance insensitivity is guaranteed . despite the great efforts during the years based on successful phenomenology  @xcite , only during the last decade",
    "has the parentage to the underlying qcd been made more explicit after the proposal  @xcite to use effective field theory ( eft ) methods and extensive use of chiral symmetry ( for comprehensive reviews see e.g. ref .",
    "eft starts out with the most general lagrangean in terms of the relevant degrees of freedom compatible with chiral symmetry , dimensional analysis and perturbative renormalization , organized by a prescribed power counting based on assuming a large scale suppression on the parameters @xmath4 .",
    "thus , by construction , eft complies to the expectation of short distance insensitivity , provided that enough counter - terms encoding the unknown short distance physics are added in perturbation theory to a finite order  @xcite .",
    "however , the physics of bound states , such as the deuteron , is genuinely non - perturbative and an infinite resummation of diagrams proves necessary ( see however  @xcite for a renewed perturbative set up ) . there arises the problem of non - perturbative renormalization and/or modifications of the original power counting for which no universally accepted scheme has been found yet , mainly because the requirements may vary .",
    "thus , although the eft method does comply to model independence it is far from trivial to achieve regulator independence and a converging pattern dictated by a reasonable power counting within a non - perturbative set up .",
    "the nn renormalization problem may be cast efficiently in the traditional language of potentials and the corresponding schrdinger equation . besides phrasing the nn interaction into the familiar and more intuitive non - relativistic quantum mechanical framework , this procedure has also the advantage that the perturbative determination of the potential complies to the desired short distance insensitivity for the potential itself  @xcite .",
    "the unconventional feature is that chiral expansions necessarily involve singular potentials at short distances , i.e. @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath7 ( or equivalently large momenta ) pion mass effects are irrelevant in loop integrals and hence at some fixed order of the expansion one has for the coupled channel potential  , see below . ]",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are nonnegative ( @xmath12 ) integers , @xmath0 the n@xmath0 splitting , and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , is a dimensionless matrix of van der waals coefficients in coupled channel space .",
    "the dimensional argument is reproduced by loop calculations in the weinberg dimensional power counting  @xcite and is scheme independent .",
    "it is thus conceivable that much of our understanding on the physics deduced from chiral potentials might be related to a proper interpretation of these highly singular potentials , which degree of singularity increases with the order of the expansion .",
    "this of course raises the question about in what sense higher order potentials are smaller .",
    "one obvious way to ensure this desired smallness is by keeping a finite and sufficiently moderate cut - off  @xcite , so the singularity of the potential is not probed , effectively recovering the power counting expectations for the size of higher order contributions .",
    "the disadvantage is that results are strongly cut - off dependent for scales about @xmath15 , similar to the ones probed in nn scattering  @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the only possibility .",
    "explicit computations  @xcite show that , when the cut - off is removed , the higher order contributions will continue to generate only small changes in the amplitudes under specific circumstances which can be determined _ a priori_. as emphasized in previous works  @xcite renormalization is the most natural tool provided 1 ) we expect the potential to be realistic at long distances and 2 ) we want short distance details to be inessential in the description . as discussed above , this is precisely the situation we face most often in nuclear physics .",
    "a surprising and intriguing feature is that knowledge on the attractive or repulsive character of the singularity , i.e. the sign of the eigenvalues of @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot - sing ] ) , turns out to be crucial to successfully achieve this program and ultimately depends on the particular scheme or power counting used to compute the potential .",
    "the singularities of chiral potentials may be disconcerting  , but they can be handled in a way that do not differ much from the standard treatment of well - behaved regular potentials which one usually encounters in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "renormalization is the mathematical implementation of the appealing physical requirement of short distance insensitivity and hence a convenient tool to search for typical long distance model- and regulator independent results . in a non - perturbative setup such as the nn problem",
    ", renormalization imposes rather tight constraints on the interplay between the unknown short distance physics and the perturbatively computable long distance interactions  @xcite .",
    "this viewpoint provides useful insights and it is within such a framework that we envisage a systematic and model independent description of the nn force based on chiral interactions . in this regard",
    "it is amazing to note how the sophisticated machinery of perturbative renormalization in quantum field theory used to compute the chiral potentials has not been so extensively developed when the inevitable non - perturbative physics must be incorporated ; quite often the renormalization process is implemented by trial and error methods by adding counter - terms suggested by the a priori power counting in momentum space . however , detailed analyses in coordinate and momentum space  @xcite show that the allowed structure of counter - terms can be anticipated on purely analytical grounds and can not be chosen independently on the long distance potential ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for numerical work ) .",
    "specifically , for a channel - subspace with good total angular momentum the number of counterterms is @xmath17 with @xmath9 the number of negative eigenvalues of the van der waals matrix @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot - sing ] ) .",
    "in fact , the much simpler coordinate space renormalization has been shown to be fully equivalent to the popular momentum space treatment for purely contact theories  @xcite and theories containing additional long range physics  @xcite .",
    "on the light of these latter studies the smallness of increasingly singular potentials such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot - sing ] ) is triggered quite naturally by choosing the regular solution of the schrdinger equation ; the wave function behaves as @xmath18 ( modulo prefactors depending on the attractive or repulsive character of the potential ) .",
    "thus , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , when the short distance cut - off @xmath19 approaches a _ fixed scale _ , @xmath20 , an increasing @xmath21 insensitivity of phase shifts and deuteron properties",
    "is guaranteed as the power of the singularity of the potential increases .",
    "indeed , calculations with chiral two pion exchange ( tpe ) potentials reproducing low energy nn data display this insensitivity for reasonable scales of @xmath22  @xcite which correspond to the shortest wavelength probed by nn scattering in the elastic region .",
    "within such a scenario , the discussion on whether one should remove the cut - off or not  @xcite would become less relevant as the order of the chiral expansion is increased in the computations .",
    "this requires of course that the same renormalization conditions are implemented , in order for the computations to represent an specific physical situation , and that the cut - off lies in the stability region @xmath23 , which in turn means that renormalization has effectively been achieved .",
    "however , despite all these findings , the question on how a sensible hierarchy for nn interactions should be organized has been left open . although we know _ whether _ and , in positive case , _ how _ this can be made compatible with the desired short distance insensitivity  @xcite , not all chiral potentials based on any given power counting are necessarily eligible .",
    "the weinberg counting based in a heavy baryon approach at leading order ( lo )  @xcite for @xmath1 and @xmath24 states turns out to be renormalizable  @xcite due to an attractive - repulsive character of the coupled channel eigen potentials at short distances .",
    "there is at present no logical need why this ought to be so , for the simple reason that power counting does not anticipate the sign of the interaction at short distances .",
    "in fact when one goes to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) the short distance @xmath25 singular repulsive character of the potential makes the deuteron unbound  @xcite because the interaction becomes singular and repulsive .",
    "finally , next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) potentials diverge as @xmath26 and are , again , compatible with weinberg counting in the deuteron  @xcite , in this case because the interaction is singular and attractive .",
    "further inconsistencies between weinberg s power counting and renormalization have been reported in refs .",
    "the previous examples show clearly that the requirement of renormalizability can be in open conflict with the idea of a convergent pattern based on a preconceived chiral expansion and the mere dimensional power counting of the original proposal  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the assumption that the nn potential can not be completely determined at arbitrary short distances is incompatible with a fully repulsive short distance singularity because finiteness implies that no counter - term is allowed .     in this",
    "regard one should note an interesting analogy between the nn interaction in the chiral quark model ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) and the van der waals molecular interactions in the born - oppenheimer approximation  @xcite . for non - relativistic constituent quarks the nn interaction is provided by the convoluted ope quark - quark potential in the direct channel since quark exchange and finite nucleon size effects can be neglected for distances larger than the nucleon size .",
    "second order perturbation theory in ope among quarks generates tpe between nucleons yielding @xmath27 for the nn potential , where @xmath28 represents a two - nucleon state and @xmath29 an arbitrary intermediate state . in regge theory one has the relation @xmath30",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 being the rho mass , which in the chiral limit and for @xmath32 implies a @xmath33 splitting @xmath34 for @xmath35 and suggests a scale numerically comparable to twice the pion mass , which actually vanishes for @xmath36 .",
    "thus , it makes sense to consider an eft where the @xmath37 splitting is regarded as a small parameter  @xcite .",
    "actually , when @xmath38 and @xmath39 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : oppenheimer ] ) resembles the result found using the feynman graph technique  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the second order perturbative character suggests that the potential becomes attractive , since @xmath40 and @xmath41 . at short distances the matrix elements scale as @xmath42 and attractive , necessarily being renormalizable with an arbitrary number of counter - terms through energy dependent boundary conditions  @xcite . clearly , the renormalization of a potential where the @xmath33 splitting is treated as a small scale deserves further investigation since it appears as an obvious candidate where all necessary requirements for a convergent and short distance insensitive scheme might be met . in the present paper",
    "we check that the naive expectations based on the simple eq .",
    "( [ eq : oppenheimer ] ) are indeed verified for the long distance chiral potentials including @xmath0 degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the delta - isobar has played a crucial role in the development of nuclear and particle physics  ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . besides fixing the number of colours @xmath43 in qcd to comply with pauli principle both at the quark as well as at the hadron level",
    ", this state can be clearly seen in @xmath44 scattering as a resonance , and it ubiquitously appears whenever the nucleon excitation energy is about the delta - nucleon splitting , @xmath45 .",
    "already in the earliest implementations of weinberg s ideas the influence of delta degrees of freedom was considered  @xcite in old - fashioned perturbation theory where energy dependent potentials are generated .",
    "energy independent potentials have been obtained using the feynman diagram technique a decade ago  @xcite and only recently the n2lo contributions have also been worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where peripheral np phase shifts are computed in perturbation theory for these @xmath0 contributions .",
    "finite cut - off calculations involving @xmath0-degrees of freedom to nlo have been analyzed in momentum space  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the inclusion of the @xmath0-excitation improves the convergence of the chiral expansion of the nn interaction  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of the @xmath1 phase with the nlo-@xmath0 chiral potential has also been discussed recently in momentum space  @xcite .",
    "short distance insensitivity has also been discussed in other contexts different from nn collisions such as @xmath46 scattering at threshold  @xcite where a rationale for the multiple scattering expansion was indeed supported by the chiral singular potentials .",
    "unfortunately , boost corrections being proportional to the average relative pn kinetic energy in the deuteron , @xmath47 , turned out to diverge due to the infinitely many short oscillations of the wave function .",
    "recently , the benefits of including the @xmath0 in such a process are discussed in @xcite where it is shown how a proper reorganization of the boost corrections not only makes them finite but also numerically small after renormalization in harmony with phenomenological expectations . the drawback is a proliferation of low energy constants when including the @xmath0 , which can render the @xmath0-full theory impractical at higher orders .",
    "the implications of a @xmath0-based power counting for the three nucleon problem are analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we focus our interest in the crucial role played by the delta - isobar in nn scattering in the elastic region from the point of view of renormalization of chiral nuclear forces , and how it might solve a long - standing problem .",
    "besides an acceptable phenomenology in the s - wave phases we also show that precisely because of the built - in short distance insensitivity and unlike previous calculations where the @xmath0-degrees of freedom were absent , the deuteron is always bound up to n2lo-@xmath0 , the highest order computed at present  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : form ]",
    "we review the formalism as applied to the energy independent potentials in a @xmath0-full theory  @xcite . in section  [ sec : singlet ] we discuss the simpler @xmath1 channel including either one or two counter - terms by means of an energy dependent boundary condition .",
    "we analyze the deuteron bound state and its properties in section  [ sec : triplet ] . scattering states in the @xmath48 channel as well as the corresponding phase shifts are constructed by orthogonality to the deuteron and compared to the results obtained with the nijmegen ii potential  @xcite , which has a @xmath49 per datum near one and therefore can be considered as an alternative partial wave analysis , compatible with the original nijmegen pwa  @xcite .",
    "the results found in this paper are further compared to the @xmath0-less theory in section  [ sec : comparison ] with previous results  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectral ] we address the issue of the relevant scales entering the calculation as well as the role of missing effects such as relativistic , @xmath50 contributions or vector meson exchange calculations .",
    "we also re - analyze a regularization of the potential based on the spectral representation motivated by dispersion relations  @xcite and discuss its meaning on the light of the present approach . finally in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we recapitulate our results and draw our main conclusions .",
    "in the present paper we use coordinate space renormalization by means of boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence to momentum space renormalization using counter - terms for singular potentials is discussed thoroughly in refs .",
    "we use the energy independent long distance chiral potentials of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are on - shell equivalent to the energy - dependent potentials of ref .",
    "we follow the convention of taking @xmath51 corrections as @xmath52 , in agreement with the original argument from ref .",
    "@xcite as well as with the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , and the computation of the n2lo-@xmath0 potential of ref .",
    "we remind that this convention is not universal , and keeping the @xmath51 corrections as @xmath53 is also customary  .",
    "this convention has the consequence that at nlo-@xmath0 and n2lo-@xmath0 relativistic corrections are suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the final expressions for the potential are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the calculation of the nn potentials can advantageously be carried out by using the method of dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "this has motivated the use of the so - called spectral regularization  @xcite in nn calculations where finite momentum space cut - offs have been implemented .",
    "remarkably , a good fit to the @xmath1 phase was achieved .",
    "this is in contrast to the n3lo computation carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite with one counterterm , where a systematic underestimation of the data was found . in our view , the relevant issue is to disentangle the cut - off artifacts from clearly attributable physical effects . in this section",
    "we analyze the issue of cutting - off the potential .",
    "the two pion exchange potential satisfies a dispersion relation based on the @xmath54 amplitude .",
    "one has the representations @xmath55 with @xmath56 and similar relations for the @xmath57 potentials .",
    "it is straightforward to see that for small @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the potentials behave as @xmath60 thus , although @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 become regular , the tensor contributions @xmath65 and @xmath66 remain singular , despite higher energy states being cut off .",
    "that means that regularization of the scattering problem in triplet channels is mandatory to obtain well defined results .",
    "note that this short distance behaviour is quite different from the one obtained for @xmath67 when @xmath68 ( see appendix  [ appendix ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential - spectral ] the ratio , @xmath69 , of @xmath1 potentials as they enter in the phase shift calculation with and without spectral regularization is depicted .",
    "we note that there is a sizeable distortion at 2 - 3 fm s with @xmath70 , decreasing the strength of the interaction and hence providing effectively a repulsion in the singlet potential .",
    "the effects of the spectral regularization on the potential can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps - pcm - spectral ] for nlo-@xmath0 and n2lo-@xmath0 both with one counter - term as well as with two counter - terms . as we see , it is possible to describe the data successfully for suitable values of the spectral cut - off @xmath71 , in agreement with the findings of ref .",
    "it is noteworthy that this happens _",
    "regardless _ on the usage of one or two counter - terms , reinforcing the conclusion that the agreement is mainly due to the distortion in the potential . in regard to the behaviour with respect to spectral regularization , the trends presented for the @xmath0-full theory are also reproduced in the @xmath0-less scheme .",
    "we remind that an accurate description of the data was achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite at n3lo-@xmath72 with a spectral regularized potential with finite momentum space cut - offs and 4 counter - terms in the @xmath1 channel ( the full n3lo computation has 24 counter - terms ) . on the other hand",
    "the data were not described for large values of @xmath73 in the n3lo-@xmath72 and ( spectrally ) unregularized renormalized calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite .    as before , it is interesting to analyze the relevant scales building up the effective range in the case of renormalization with one counter - term . in fig .",
    "[ fig : r0-rc - spectral ] , we show the effective range @xmath74 as a function of the short distance cut - off @xmath19 for several values of the spectral cut - off @xmath58 . clearly",
    ", the stability region in @xmath19 is shifted towards lower values as the spectral cut - off is decreased .",
    "this is consistent with the large distortion of the potential at intermediate scales .",
    "we have also analyzed the impact of the spectral regularization on the already successful description of the deuteron presented in previous papers and the present one .",
    "the results do not change noticeably after ( spectrally ) regularizing the potential : they lie between the results obtained with the ope potential and with nlo- and n2lo-@xmath0 .",
    "this is compatible with the weakening of these contributions to the chiral potential .",
    "although the final results are rather simple to summarize , some remarks should be added on the renormalization procedure for the deuteron channel when spectral regularization is applied .",
    "the modified nlo- and n2lo-@xmath0 chiral potentials have now an attractive and repulsive eigen - channel , instead two attractive ones , which lead us to the following alternative : either we remove the cutoff , in which case we can only fix the binding energy and obtain the d - to - s ratio @xmath75 as a prediction , or we keep a finite cutoff , and then fix both the binding energy and @xmath75 .",
    "provided that the finite cut - off is sensible , about @xmath76 ( i.e. the saturation scale ) for a spectral cutoff @xmath77 , both procedures give equivalent results . the previous discussion on the effects of spectral cut - off agree with the remarks presented in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the effects of this regularization of the potential for the deuteron form factors . for completeness",
    "we show the results in table  [ tab : deut_prop_sr ] .    in summary",
    ", reducing the strength of the potential at short distances by means of the spectral regularization is phenomenologically preferred in the singlet channel and innocuous in the triplet channel , but distorts largely the chiral potential in a region much larger than the nucleon size .",
    "moreover , we find that within our scheme the agreement with the data is achieved _",
    "regardless _ of the additional counter - terms invoked by weinberg s counting , being in fact superfluous after renormalization .",
    "this said , although the spectral regularization improves over the standard finite cut - off approaches and seems phenomenologically favoured , the inclusion of finite size effects in a model independent manner would certainly be very useful .",
    "since more than fifteen years there has been a growing interest in pursuing an eft description of nn scattering below pion production threshold where the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry in qcd is manifestly exploited .",
    "one of the reasons which have greatly hindered the eft developments within the nn context has been the lack of a credible power counting for the potential which at the same time complies to short distance insensitivity . given the tight constraints under which this might actually happen , it has not been obvious which particular form of the chiral expansion indeed embodies these desirable properties . in the present work",
    "we have shown how the inclusion of @xmath0 degrees of freedom in the potential not only complies to a phenomenologically well founded motivation , but also provides the requested short distance insensitivity of the central phases and the deuteron properties after the necessary renormalization is carried out .",
    "this improves the previous situation without explicit @xmath0 degrees of freedom : while at lo-@xmath72 and n2lo-@xmath72 the existence of a deuteron was compatible with renormalizability , at nlo-@xmath72 that was not the case .",
    "this has raised reasonable doubts on the suitability and usefulness of non - perturbative renormalization _ per se _ to chiral potentials .",
    "a very rewarding aspect of the present investigation is the existence of a deuteron bound state at lo , nlo-@xmath0 and n2lo-@xmath0 . of course , a proof of consistency to all orders , including relativistic , spin - orbit , three pion exchange corrections , etc .",
    ", remains to be done .",
    "this is so because , although the power law behaviour of the chiral potential at short distances can be trivially fixed by dimensional arguments and power counting , the determination of the attractive - repulsive character of the potential can so far only be fixed by actual calculations .",
    "the found deuteron properties seem to obey a converging pattern and in the @xmath78 phase a clear improvement is observed at n2lo-@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , our n2lo-@xmath0 results resemble much those of n2lo-@xmath72 after renormalization for reasonable parameter values describing the @xmath44 reaction close to threshold .",
    "this suggests that despite the previous inconsistency in nlo-@xmath72 , the n2lo-@xmath72 deuteron wave functions can be used for practical purposes , despite the theoretically unpleasant and disturbing `` jumping '' of the nlo-@xmath72 calculation .",
    "in addition , it should be reminded that within these approximations the @xmath44 threshold properties can be fitted , with the sole exception of @xmath79 , and thus the overall consistency between the @xmath44 and @xmath80 sectors is almost satisfied .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the @xmath0 resonance complies with the original eft motivation of describing _ simultaneously _ @xmath44 and @xmath80 scattering at low energies .",
    "we have also found that at the level of approximations involved in the present and previous renormalized calculations , the @xmath1 phase shift is not entirely reproduced for c.m .",
    "momenta larger than the pion mass if we insist on a reasonable @xmath44 physics .",
    "several effects might be responsible for this persistent discrepancy .",
    "we have discussed those on the light of the relevant scales , @xmath81 , which practically provide the total contribution to observables . we have further discussed parameterizations of the nn force based on a spectral regularization of the nn potential with a cut - off of @xmath82 .",
    "we have shown that agreement to data is achieved mainly due to a large distortion of the potential at 2 - 3 fm and regardless on additional inclusion of counter - terms .",
    "these length scales are much larger than the expected finite nucleon size or vector meson exchange effects , casting doubts on the usefulness of spectral regularization and suggesting the need for a more controllable and better founded description of the missing short distance physics in the @xmath1 channel .    in the present paper",
    "we have restricted to central phases and the deuteron , but the calculation of higher partial waves is also of interest , as well as the inclusion of coulomb effects in pp scattering . in all cases ,",
    "the negative definite character of the potential at short distances guarantees the existence of convergent results . finally , the present results can have some impact on calculations including deuteron properties such as deuteron form factors , pion - deuteron scattering , and further low energy matrix elements of electroweak deuteron reactions where short distance insensitivity and chiral symmetry are both expected to play a significant role .",
