    "since the first observation of the synchronization phenomenon in two weakly coupled pendulum clocks by huygens , various aspects of this unique phenomenon have been studied .",

    "spontaneous synchronization is of a great interest because it corresponds to the case in which systems synchronize their motion only due to their mutual interaction without the existence of any external driving field .",
    "self - sustained oscillators emerging in the nonlinear systems provide a suitable platform for investigating the spontaneous synchronization .",

    "theoretical and experimental aspects of this emerging field of study have been investigated intensively in the last few years @xcite . despite their difference in the range of the parameters and their configurations , omss share common features .",
    "they have an inherent nonlinearity associated with the radiation pressure interaction , and a high sensitivity of the system dynamics on the detuning between the laser drive and the cavity .",
    "for some application , for instance position or force sensing @xcite , the detuning is chosen to be zero , and for some others like backaction cooling @xcite or state transfer @xcite a red - detuned laser drive is used . for entanglement purpose a blue - detuned laser",
    "is exploited @xcite . when an oms is driven by a blue - detuned pump laser",
    ", the radiation pressure amplifies the mechanical motion via the dynamical backaction and above a certain threshold laser power the mechanical oscillator exhibits self - sustained oscillations @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is inherently due to the non - linear nature of the optomechanical interaction .",
    "both theoretical and experimental aspects of this phenomenon have been investigated in the classical regime @xcite , while in the quantum realm , limit cycles have also been explored only theoretically up - to - now @xcite .    when multiple optomechanical oscillators are placed in a single cavity new collective phenomena arise due to the mutual coupling via the radiation pressure .",
    "of great importance of collective behavior is the investigation of synchronization in omss @xcite .",
    "based on these motivations , in this paper , we consider the dynamics of two membranes within a fabry - perot cavity with a view towards synchronization .",
    "we study the quantum dynamics of the two membranes inside the cavity , in the parameter regime where the classical dynamics manifest synchronization between them @xcite , focusing therefore to a sort of quantum analog of the original huygens experiment . by using the heisenberg - langevin ( hl ) approach and linearizing the hl equations",

    "we have studied the case of a membrane - in - the - middle optomechanical setup in which two membranes , both interacting with the same mode of an optical fabry - perot cavity , can be synchronized when the cavity mode is driven with a sufficiently large power , due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of the radiation pressure interaction which leads to self - sustained oscillations .",

    "we have seen that , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , entanglement is not related in general to synchronization , and in fact , it is absent in correspondence of synchronization of the classical motion .",
    "this is not surprising since synchronization only involves the phase mechanical quadratures and their correlation , and not the whole set of possible as correlations .",
    "quantum discord , on the contrary seems to be related in some way , because it is nonzero , even in the presence of quantum noise , when the membranes are synchronized . moreover synchronization and also quantum discord seem robust with respect to quantum noise , and synchronization is also relatively robust with respect to thermal noise .",
    "in fact , the variance of the phase difference is proportional to the bath temperature @xmath88 but it increases quite slowly with increasing @xmath88 , while the gaussian quantum discord vanishes quite rapidly as soon as the temperature is nonzero . as an outlook ,",
