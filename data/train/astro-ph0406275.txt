    "weak gravitational lensing has attracted considerable interest recently as a means of measuring the density perturbations in the universe at low redshifts because it is directly sensitive to the matter distribution .",

    "comparison of the shear power spectra at different redshifts and/or to the primordial fluctuation amplitude derived from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy measurements , can constrain the cosmological growth factor and hence parameters such as the neutrino mass , amplitude of fluctuations @xmath8 , and dark energy equation of state @xcite .    while the underlying physics of weak lensing is `` clean , '' the shear measurements are subject to possible systematic errors including incomplete correction for seeing and optical distortions , selection effects , and noise - rectification biases , and their cosmological interpretation relies on accurate knowledge of the redshift distribution of the source galaxies . another possible systematic error",
    "is intrinsic ( i.e. not lensing - induced ) correlations among the ellipticities of neighboring source galaxies @xcite , which could arise if the galaxy ellipticities are affected by large - scale tidal fields .",
    "this systematic is particularly worrisome because it lies outside the control of the observer , and is dependent upon the poorly understood physics of galaxy formation .",
    "one frequently proposed method to reduce this contamination is to assign photometric redshifts to the source galaxies , and then to down - weight or ignore pairs of galaxies at similar redshifts when computing the shear correlation function or power spectrum ; see ref .",

    "the idea is that the pairs of galaxies widely separated in redshift should have independent intrinsic ellipticities but should have correlated gravitational shears induced by structures between the observer and the more nearby source galaxy .",
    "while cross - correlation of different redshift bins is expected to remove spurious power due to the intrinsic alignment autocorrelation , there is another , more subtle effect by which even the cross - correlations can be contaminated from intrinsic alignments .",
    "if the ellipticities of galaxies are correlated with the tidal quadrupole field in which the galaxies form , then the intrinsic ellipticity of a nearby source galaxy will be correlated with the lensing shear acting on a more distant source galaxy .",
    "this leads to a nonzero cross - correlation between the intrinsic ellipticity and the gravitational lensing shear .",
    "cross - correlations between the shear measurements at widely different redshifts are actually more contaminated by this effect than shear autocorrelations computed using only galaxies in a narrow redshift slice , because the radial separation is necessary in order for the tidal field around the nearby galaxy to lens the more distant galaxy .",
    "this intrinsic - lensing correlation will also affect attempts to cross - correlate cosmic shear surveys of galaxies with lensing of the cmb @xcite because the cmb is also lensed by the tidal field surrounding the source galaxies .",

    "one implication of this is that the @xmath3-mode signal , frequently used as a systematics test , may be a misleading indicator of intrinsic alignment contamination , since it is sensitive only to the intrinsic - intrinsic autopower @xmath166 but not to the gravitational - intrinsic cross - power @xmath167 , which can only be nonvanishing for the @xmath9 modes .",
    "[ fig : broad](c ) provides an extreme example : here the change in @xmath168 due to intrinsic alignments exceeds the @xmath3-mode power spectrum @xmath169 by @xmath170 orders of magnitude .",
    "the opposite extreme is the quadratic alignment model in which there is no gravitational - intrinsic correlation and the @xmath9 and @xmath3 mode contributions from intrinsic alignments are similar .",
    "a realistic model of intrinsic alignments will likely fall somewhere in between these two extremes . the linear alignment model ( eq .  [ eq : model1 ] )",
    "obviously predicts maximal correlation between the density and intrinsic shear fields on large scales in the sense that the correlation coefficient @xmath171 has absolute value @xmath172 .",
    "any higher - order corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : model1 ] ) will therefore reduce the correlation coefficient .",
    "on the other hand , the simplest form of the quadratic alignment model ( eq .  [ eq : model2 ] ) is probably too optimistic , even though the model is well - motivated by tidal torque theory .",
    "we found @xmath173 for this model not because of any fundamental symmetry principle , but rather because the assumed gaussianity of the density field causes third - order statistics in @xmath174 to vanish . in the real universe",
    "we can expect tidally torqued galaxies to have @xmath175 because of non - gaussianity from nonlinear evolution @xcite , and because of third- and higher - order corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : model2 ] ) that we have neglected .",
    "while we have presented these results for the power spectrum , the non - gaussianity of the density field , and hence of cosmic shear , has motivated studies of other statistics , most notably the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "the bispectrum can in principle pick up three types of intrinsic alignment contamination : the intrinsic shear bispectrum ( @xmath176 ) , and the gravitational - gravitation - intrinsic ( @xmath177 ) and gravitational - intrinsic - intrinsic ( @xmath178 ) cross - bispectra . if tomography is used , the measured bispectrum components are @xmath179 , where @xmath29 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 are indices indicating the source bins centered at redshifts @xmath182 . assuming that these bins do not overlap significantly in redshift",
    ", the @xmath176 contaminant is only nonvanishing for the triplets where all three source galaxies lie in the same redshift slice @xmath183 ; this is only a small fraction of the triplets and hence little statistical power is lost by rejecting them @xcite .",
    "@xmath177 is produced by a density - density - intrinsic shear bispectrum in the nearest of the three slices , and it can in principle contaminate any tomographic shear bispectrum in which @xmath184 .",
    "@xmath178 is produced by the density - intrinsic - intrinsic bispectrum , again in the nearest of the three slices , but this time in order to have the intrinsic shear be correlated and to produce a lensing effect on the more distant slice , @xmath178 satisfies a `` selection rule '' @xmath185 .",
    "thus every triplet of source screens is potentially contaminated by exactly one of @xmath177 , @xmath178 , or @xmath176 .",
    "note also that the quadratic alignment model ( sec .  [ ss : m2 ] ) , which at lowest order predicted no @xmath0 contamination to the power spectrum , does predict a @xmath177 contamination @xmath186 because the intrinsic shear @xmath36 is a quadratic function of @xmath174 .",
    "we defer a calculation of the magnitude of this effect to a future paper .",
    "our analysis clearly motivates observations to constrain the density - intrinsic shear correlation .",
    "just as the intrinsic shear autopower can be constrained by low - redshift measurements where the lensing signal is negligible @xcite , so it should be possible to use these same low - redshift measurements to measure @xmath114 provided that a tracer of the density field is available .",
    "the number density of galaxies is one possibility ; recent observations have probed the galaxy - intrinsic shear correlation on @xmath187@xmath188  mpc scales @xcite , and it would be useful to extend these studies to larger scales where linear biasing is valid .",
    "( at least one density - shear correlation measurement is available on large scales @xcite .",
    "these authors were interested primarily in using intrinsic alignments to reconstruct the density field ; they therefore did not use lensing shear estimators , and they measured three - dimensional separations in redshift space , so their results are difficult to interpret in the present context . ) for such observations , it would also be useful to distinguish types of galaxies ( e.g. early vs. late ) ; if one type of galaxy turns out to have significantly greater @xmath114 , the shear power spectra could be performed principally on the other types so as to reduce contamination .",
    "a second approach to eliminate the contamination is to project out the information that correlates with the known redshift scaling of the signal in the cross - correlations between narrow redshift bins , assuming these are available from the photo-@xmath154 methods .",
    "this method is geometric and achieves perfect decontamination under these idealized assumptions , but projection does destroy some information in the data . it also puts severe requirements on the accuracy of photometric redshifts , which may require many passbands to achieve this @xcite .    in summary , we have shown that cosmic shear surveys will need to consider the possibility of intrinsic alignment contamination from its interference with weak lensing induced shear .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is extremely model - dependent and can range from essentially zero ( simplest quadratic alignment models ) to severe ( simplest linear alignment models ) . in the latter case",
    "it can exceed intrinsic correlations by an order of magnitude and can not be identified using @xmath3-mode power spectrum , nor can it be eliminated using cross - correlations between different redshift slices .",
    "this result is disappointing and implies that this effect could be very damaging for efforts to use weak lensing as a high precision test of cosmology with future surveys such as pan - starrs , lsst or snap .",
    "however , the situation is far from hopeless : here we have considered several possible ways to constrain and/or suppress the contamination . the next step observationally is a density - shear correlation analysis with the shear computed using a lensing estimator in a wide - angle , shallow survey such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite to constrain @xmath189 ; the next step theoretically is a thorough analysis of the various methods described above for suppressing the gravitational - intrinsic contamination , in particular to understand how much degradation on the cosmological parameters occurs and whether they increase sensitivity to any of the other potential systematics such as photo-@xmath154 errors , shear calibration errors , and spurious power ."
