    "chandra , with its superior angular resolution , has resolved populations of point sources in many early - type galaxies ( e.g. , angelini , lowenstein & mushotzky 2001 ; sarazin , irwin & bregman 2001 ; kraft et al .",

    "the minimum luminosity for an ulx corresponds to the eddington luminosity of the most massive black holes expected to form from stellar core collapse ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ) . the nature and origin of ulxs are unknown , but they could arise from non - isotropic emission from stellar mass black holes ( king et al .",

    "they derived best - fit parameters of @xmath36  @xmath29 and @xmath37 for the second brightest source in ngc 3379 , which accounts for    much of the difference between our two luminosity estimates for the second brightest source in ngc 3379 .      excluding the central agn ,",
    "there are 39 detected sources in the central 5  kpc of the galaxy ( see the luminosity function in fig .",
    "we first fitted the luminosity function of all 39 sources using the maximum likelihood method in crawford , jauncey & murdoch ( 1970 ) to a power - law model ( @xmath38 ) and obtained a best - fit index of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 error ) .",
    "this gives a reasonable fit at low fluxes , but significantly overestimates the number of brighter sources .",
    "we then repeated the analysis only including sources detected at more than @xmath41 and obtained an acceptable fit with @xmath42 ( see fig .",

    "the flattening of the luminosity function at low fluxes may be due to the presence of extended emission in the center of the galaxy which raises the detection threshold in this region .",
    "kim & fabbiano ( 2004 ) recently derived the luminosity function for a sample of early - type galaxies , including ngc 3379 , but they only included sources beyond the central @xmath44 and within the @xmath45 ellipse ( @xmath46 by @xmath47 ) .",

    "fitting the luminosity function of the 12 sources with luminosities greater than @xmath49  ergs  s@xmath6 and within the @xmath45 ellipse , they obtained a best - fit index for the cumulative luminosity function of @xmath50 , which is consistent with our results within the errors .",
    "in general , star forming galaxies have flatter luminosity functions than early - type galaxies .",

    "however , the average slope of the    14 ellipticals analyzed in the kim & fabbiano ( 2004 ) sample is @xmath53 , which is consistent with our result for ngc 3379 .    while the ratio of the combined x - ray luminosity of the detected point sources in ngc 3379 to the optical luminosity of the galaxy is consistent with other early - type galaxies observed by chandra ( colbert et al . 2004 ) , the point sources have a much more centrally peaked surface brightness profile than the optical light of the galaxy ( see fig .",
    "the optical surface brightness profile in fig .",
    "4 is based on the de vaucouleurs profile for ngc 3379 found by capaccioli et al .",

    "however , there is significantly more diffuse emission in m84 compared to ngc 3379 , and the deficit of point sources in the core may be due to the lower sensitivity of detecting point sources in the presence of diffuse emission .",
    "accounting for the lower sensitivity of detecting point sources in the core of ngc 3379 , would only increase the excess of point sources within the central few kpc .",
    "of all the discrete sources in ngc 3379 , only the ulx has sufficient counts for a detailed spectral analysis ( see @xmath14 ) . to help in the identification of the detected point sources",

    "this figure shows that the globular cluster sample is highly incomplete within the central @xmath44 due to the difficulty of detecting globulars against the brightest parts of the galaxy .",

    "thus , incompleteness in the globular cluster sample    should not have a significant impact on the small fraction of x - ray point sources associated with globular clusters in ngc 3379 , especially since sarazin et al .",

    "the probability of detecting a background source with a flux equal to , or greater than this value within the central @xmath23 of the galaxy is less than @xmath68 .",

    "to check for long - term variability in the ulx , we examined the 24  ksec rosat hri observation of ngc 3379 taken on aug . 2 , 1996 and found that the x - ray emission was centered on the ulx , not the center of the galaxy .",
    "the net hri count rate within a @xmath64 radius aperture ( corresponding to the 90% encircled energy radius ) centered on the j2000 coordinates of the ulx as determined from the s3 image is @xmath70  ct  s@xmath6 . assuming an absorbed power - law model with the best - fit parameters listed above gives an unabsorbed 0.3 - 10.0  kev flux of @xmath71  ergs  @xmath29  s@xmath6 , which is 50% higher than the acis measured flux of the ulx in 2001 .",
    "the hri flux measurement is undoubtedly affected by contamination from other point sources .",
    "based on the s3 image , the ulx contributes 60% of the flux within the same apperature used to compute the hri flux .",
    "thus , there is strong evidence that the ulx was at a comparable luminosity 5 years prior to the chandra observation .",
    "there are insufficient counts in the hri data to measure short term variability .",
    "after excising the emission from all detected point sources , we extracted a spectrum of the diffuse emission within the central @xmath72 ( 770  pc ) .",
    "a background spectrum was taken from a circular aperture @xmath73 from the center of the galaxy on the s3 chip .",
    "the background subtracted spectrum was then fitted to an absorbed thermal ( mekal ) plus power - law model in the 0.3 - 5.0  kev band .",

    "this analysis shows that 90% of the remaining diffuse emission most likely arises from point sources with fluxes below the detection limit in the chandra observation . assuming the luminosity function derived above is valid at lower luminosities , then the luminosity of the unresolved power - law component can be generated by approximately 40 sources below @xmath79  ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "using the best - fit emission measure in the thermal model and assuming a uniform gas distribution in the central 770  pc gives an electron number density of @xmath80  @xmath81 , a gas mass of @xmath2 , and a cooling time ( @xmath82 ) of @xmath83 yr .",

    "the continuous injection of gas shed by evolving stars with a temperature equal to the virial temperature of the stellar system essentially negates the effects of radiative cooling .",

    "this low efficiency is typical of that found for supermassive black holes at the centers of ellipticals ( lowenstein et al .",
    "2001 , dimatteo et al .",
    "the low luminosity of the central black holes in ellipticals can be explained by either a very low radiative efficiency , as in the advection dominated accretion flow model ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 ) or radiatively inefficient accretion flow model ( riaf ; yuan & narayan 2005 ) , or a reduction in the accretion rate , as in models with both inflow and agn driven outflows ( e.g. , blandford & belgelman 1999 ) .    while the uncertainty on the temperature of the diffuse gas is large , the best - fit temperature is twice the temperature associated with the velocity dispersion of the stars ( kt=@xmath96  kev for @xmath97  km  s@xmath6 ; prugniel & simien 1996 ) .",
    "this suggests that the gas is being heated by the central agn and is presently flowing out of the system in a galactic wind . assuming the gas is in a steady - state wind ( i.e. , @xmath98 at 770 pc ) gives @xmath99  km  s@xmath6 and an energy outflow rate ( mostly thermal ) of @xmath100ergs  s@xmath6 , which is 4 orders of magnitude greater than the radio luminosity of the agn .",
    "the low wind velocity near the galactic center is typical of galactic wind models since the wind velocity continues to increase with increasing radius ( e.g. , david , forman & jones 1991 ) .",

    "assuming isotropic emission , 3 of these binaries are super - eddington , with peak luminosities up to 7 times their eddington - limit , suggesting that some of the extragalactic ulxs could be stellar mass black holes . king ( 2003 ) has proposed that ulxs comprise two separate classes of super - eddington mass accretion rate systems . in regions of recent star formation in spiral galaxies ,",
    "ulxs would arise from thermal - timescale mass transfer in high mass x - ray binaries , while in elliptical galaxies , the ulxs would be similar to the micro - quasars observed in our galaxy .",
    "the long term stability of the ulx in ngc 3379 as determined from the rosat hri and chandra observations , may pose a problem for the micro - quasar interpretation of ulxs in early - type galaxies .",
    "the mass of the central compact object in a ulx can be estimated , if thermal emission from an accretion disk can be detected , since the temperature at the inner edge of an accretion disk scales as @xmath104 .",
    "spectral analysis of asca data on ulxs indicated that these objects could be described by the mcd model with inner disk temperatures of @xmath105  kev , implying stellar masses for the accreting objects ( makishima et al .",
    "more recent analysis of chandra and xmm - newton data , however , indicate that some ulxs can be described as pure power - laws with @xmath106 , while others require a power - law plus disk model ( e.g. , roberts et al .",

    "soft accretion disks have been detected in two ulxs in ngc 1313 with inner disk temperatures of 150  ev , implying masses of @xmath107 ( miller et al .",
    "while we can not estimate the black hole mass in the ulx in ngc 3379 due to the lack of detectable thermal emission from the disk , the best - fit power - law index ( @xmath30 ) is consistent with recent chandra and xmm - newton results and similar to the low hard state observed in galactic bhbs ( mcclintock & remillard 2004 )    the power - law spectrum of the ulx in ngc 3379 suggests that the emission is dominated by compton up - scattering of soft disk photons in a optically thin corona .",
    "the variability in the light curve could arise from a partial eclipse or absorption by cooler material in the outer parts of the accretion disk .",
    "the slow rise and fall times in the light curve ( see fig .",
    "8) , along with the lack of any variation in hardness ratio , suggest that the intensity variation is due to a partial eclipse of the extended coronal emission with a period of 8 - 10 hours .",
    "while variability on the scales of months to years is well known for ulxs , there are only a few published cases of periodic variability on the time scale of hours , all of which are in late - type galaxies ( sugiho et al .",

    "the ulx in ngc 3379 is the only known ulx in an early - type galaxy with possible periodic behavior in its light curve on the time scale of hours .",
    "orbital periods of 8 - 10 hr are very common for lmxbs ( verbunt 1993 ) . assuming that the secondary star is filling its roche lobe and transferring mass to the primary",
    ", we can estimate the mass of the secondary .",
    "using the expression for the roche lobe radius from paczynski ( 1967 ) and kepler s law gives @xmath108  hr ( verbunt 1993 ) .",
    "for main sequence stars @xmath109 , indicating that if the period is 8 - 10 hr , then the secondary star is approximately a solar mass .",
    "the mass - radius relation for a he core burning star or a white dwarf predicts a much larger mass for the secondary which is unlikely in an early - type galaxy .",
    "the chandra observation of the intermediate luminosity elliptical galaxy ngc 3379 shows that only a small fraction of the gas shed by evolving stars still resides within the hot ism .",
    "a wavelet detection algorithm resolves 75% of the emission within the central 5  kpc into point sources .",
    "the luminosity function of the point sources detected at greater than @xmath41 significance is consistent with that found for other ellipticals observed by chandra ( kim & fabbiano 2004 ) . unlike other ellipticals observed by chandra , only 8% of the point sources are associated with globular clusters , which is comparable to the fraction of lmxbs in our galaxy .",
    "the low specific frequency of globular clusters and the low fraction of x - ray point sources associated with globulars clusters in ngc3379 is actually more similar to chandra observations of s0 galaxies rather than ellipticals ( e.g. , blanton , sarazin & irwin 2001 ) .",
    "spectral analysis of the unresolved emission within the central @xmath72 ( 770  pc ) indicates that 90% of the emission probably arises from point sources with fluxes below the detection limit in the chandra observation .",
    "if the luminosity function of the detected point sources is valid at lower luminosities , then the diffuse power - law emission can be accounted for by approximately 40 sources with luminosities below @xmath110  ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "the remaining 10% of the unresolved emission from the central 770  pc is well described by thermal emission with @xmath1  kev . assuming a uniform gas density in this region gives a gas mass of @xmath2 , which can be supplied by stellar mass loss in @xmath3  years .",
    "such a small amount of gas indicates that the stellar mass loss is either being expelled from the central regions in a wind or is being accreted by the central black hole .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the central agn is @xmath111  ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "if gas is being accreted by the central black hole at either the bondi accretion rate or mass cooling rate , then the radiative efficiency of the black hole must be @xmath112 , as in the adaf or riaf models models ( narayan & yi 1994 and yuan & narayan 1995 ) .",
    "if the gas is flowing out of the system in a wind , the energy outflow rate would be @xmath100  ergs  s@xmath6 , which is 4 orders of magnitude greater than the 1.4  ghz radio power of the agn .",
    "such a large ratio between agn mechanical and radio power is commonly found among cluster cooling flows with x - ray cavities and shocks ( birzan et al .",

    "the most luminous source in ngc3379 is located 360  pc from the central agn with a peak luminosity of @xmath5ergs  s@xmath6 , corresponding to the eddington luminosity of a @xmath69 object .",
    "the spectrum of this source is well fitted with an absorbed power - law model with @xmath30 , which is similar to other ulxs observed by chandra and xmm - newton and the low - hard state of galactic black hole binaries .",
    "examining the archival rosat hri observation of ngc 3379 shows that the ulx was at a comparable luminosity 5 years prior to the chandra observation .",
    "the long term stability of the ulx may pose a problem for the micro - quasar interpretation of ulxs in early - type galaxies .",
    "the light curve of the ulx in ngc 3379 varies smoothly by a factor of two during the chandra observation . the slow rise and fall times in the light curve and the consistency of the power - law spectrum during the observation",
    "all suggest that the ulx is undergoing a partial eclipse of the extended corona surrounding an accretion disk with a period of 8 - 10  hr . assuming the secondary is a main sequence star filling its roche lobe gives a mass for the secondary of approximately @xmath113 . variability has been observed in other ulxs , but the ulx in ngc 3379 is the only ulx in an elliptical galaxy with possible periodic behavior . due to the high surface brightness density of sources in the central 1  kpc of ngc 3379 ,",
    "only a long chandra observation can determine if the lightcurve of the ulx is truly periodic .",
