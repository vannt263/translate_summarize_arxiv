    "within the canonical quantization of diffeomorphism invariant theories of connections , at some stage one is forced to deal with the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "examples of such theories are given by gravity in 3 and 4 dimensions , when formulated as theories of connections @xcite .",
    "as first noticed by rovelli and smolin @xcite , when the basic observables are the ( traces of ) holonomies of the connection @xmath1 along loops @xmath2 in the manifold , finite diffeomorphisms act simply by shifting the loops as prescribed by the mapping @xmath3 : @xmath4 .",
    "further developments of this idea rigorously solve the diffeomorphism constraint in the continuum . for a complete discussion of the quantization of diffeomorphism invariant theories",
    "see @xcite .    in theories that have discretized space from the outset",
    ", the issue of the diffeomorphism constraint has a special character . in some of these discretized theories ,",
    "space is replaced with an abstract lattice ; that is , a lattice that does not `` reside '' in a manifold @xcite .",
    "hence the diffeomorphism symmetry is lost in this approach .",
    "however , an abstract lattice @xmath5 can be viewed as an equivalence class of embedded lattices @xmath6 $ ] under the equivalence relation defined by the diffeomorphism group , in the sense used in knot theory to define knot classes .",
    "it has been argued that this picture implies that the theory defined on an abstract lattice is manifestly diffeomorphism invariant , and therefore , there is no need to further impose the diffeomorphism constraint @xcite .",
    "a different approach considers that even after discretization , the phase space associated to the abstract lattice still has a reminiscent symmetry related to the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "this strategy has been successful in treating theories without local degrees of freedom like @xmath0 gravity and @xmath7 theories @xcite .",
    "a third strategy on the lattice , embedded in a manifold , is to require invariance under a discrete symmetry such that diffeomorphism invariance is recovered in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "we will focus our attention on the first two strategies for discrete theories",
    ".    the physically meaningful aspects of a lattice theory are the ones regarding its continuum limit .",
    "this makes comparison between different lattice approaches a delicate issue . to illustrate the discrepancy between the two lattice approaches described above",
    ", we shall consider @xmath0 dimensional gravity . in this framework",
    "the role of the continuum limit is not very significant because it is a theory with only global degrees of freedom that are fully contained in the lattice theory already .",
    "we show that by assuming that a theory based on abstract lattices is manifestly diffeomorphism invariant one fails to ` subtract ' the appropriate degrees of freedom from the unconstrained theory .",
    "therefore , the resulting theory is not the one we wanted to quantize ; it has too many degrees of freedom .    in the second part of the article",
    ", we consider diffeomorphism invariant theories for compact gauge groups . for this class of theories ,",
    "there is a well defined formalism to treat the quantization both in the continuum and in the lattice . for completeness",
    ", we first review this formalism and then show that , independently of the details of the continuum limit one might choose to take , there is still a residual symmetry associated to diffeomorphisms .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the classical description of @xmath0 gravity as a theory of connections , both in the continuum and in the lattice formulation .",
    "section iii is devoted to discussing the quantum theory for general theories of connections with compact gauge groups .",
    "we review first the quantization in the continuum and then in the lattice .",
    "it is shown that one must impose all constraints , including the ones associated to diffeomorphism , in order to recover the physical theory .",
    "we conclude in sec .",

    "in this part we give a brief review of the continuum description following the notation of @xcite . for a detailed exposition",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers @xcite .",

    ", the phase space @xmath11 can be coordinatized by pairs @xmath12 on @xmath10 . here , @xmath13 is the pull - back to @xmath10 of the 3-dimensional lorentz connection . as a field on the hyper - surface",
    "it is a one - form with values in the lorentz lie - algebra @xmath14 .",
    "the canonical momenta is given by the vector densities @xmath15 .",

    "( throughout we will raise and lower the internal index @xmath18 with the minkowski metric @xmath19 ) .",
    "the canonical pair of variables satisfy the usual poisson bracket relations , \\{a_a^i(x),^b_j(y)}=^i_j^b_a^3(x , y ) . from this variables",
    "we can recover the 2-dimensional metric @xmath20 on @xmath10 of the usual geometrodynamical formulation as follows : g_ab=_ije_a^ie_b^j . since we want to consider positive definite metrics @xmath20",
    ", we should impose the restriction on the phase space coordinates that @xmath21 be non - degenerate .",
    "there are two constraints on the phase space , given by _",
    "a ^a_i=0 f^i_ab=0 , where @xmath22 denotes the generalized covariant derivative defined by @xmath13 , namely @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the curvature of the connection : @xmath25}^i+[a_a , a_b]^i$ ] .",
    "the first constraint is known as the gauss law . in order to analyze what the constraints generate ,",
    "let us define the smeared functions on @xmath11 , g[v]&:=&_v^id_a ^a_i , f[]&:=&__i^abf^i_ab.[wittcon ] the infinitesimal canonical transformation generated by the constraint functions will depend , of course , on the smearing fields @xmath26 .",
    "the gauss constraint @xmath27 $ ] generates gauge transformations on the connection @xmath13 and ` rotations ' in the momenta @xmath15 .",
    "the constraint function @xmath28 $ ] leaves the connection invariant and ` shifts ' the conjugate momenta .",
    "we know that this constrained system is equivalent to the geometrodynamical description @xcite .",
    "therefore , an appropriate combination of the constraint functions should generate the induced action of diffeomorphisms on @xmath10 .",
    "let us start by considering the connection @xmath29 .",
    "since the curvature constraint does not depend on the momenta @xmath30 , it leaves the connection unchanged .",
    "that means that the only way one can generate diffeomorphism on the connection is via the gauss constraint , with an appropriate smearing field @xmath31 .",
    "consider the vector field @xmath32 on @xmath10 , as generator of infinitesimal diffeomorphisms .",
    "the function , _",

    "more generally , the generator of spatial diffeomorphisms is given by , d[v]=_v^b(a_b^id_a^a_i-^a_if^i_ab ) .",
    "[ d[v ] ] note that the second term , where we have chosen @xmath33}_i$ ] , can also be interpreted as the projection of the curvature constraint along the vector density @xmath15 .",
    "one way to impose the curvature constraint is to require that the projections of the curvature in every internal direction vanish .",
    "in fact , after imposing ( [ d[v ] ] ) we need only one more projection of the curvature constraint .",
    "h[n]:=_n_i^jk^a_j^b_kf^i_ab , where @xmath34 is a scalar density of weight @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , provided that the co - triad @xmath36 is non - degenerate , the witten constraints ( [ wittcon ] ) and the ashtekar constraints ( below ) are equivalent @xcite . _ a^a_i&=&0,^b_if^i_ab&=&0,[ashtcon ] + _ i^jk^a_j^b_kf^i_ab&=&0.the witten constraints can be seen as ` covariant ' since there is no explicit decomposition of the 3-dimensional diffeomorphisms into a ` spatial ' and ` orthogonal ' components .",
    "the ashtekar constraints on the other hand , do exhibit this decomposition .",
    "they are more closely related to the constraints one encounters in the 3 + 1-dimensional theory . when one allows for degenerate triads ( and therefore singular induced metrics ) , the constraints ( [ ashtcon ] ) do not imply the vanishing of the curvature @xmath24 .",
    "the structure of such extended phase space has been studied in @xcite .      in this part , we recall the lattice formulation of @xmath0 gravity due to waelbroeck@xcite . for the convenience of the reader",
    "the roles of the dual lattice and the lattice itself are reversed , with respect to @xcite .",
    "the starting point is a two dimensional abstract lattice of arbitrary valence ; the @xmath37 vertices of the lattice are labeled by greek indices @xmath38 , the @xmath39 links are labeled as pairs of vertices @xmath40 and the @xmath41 faces are labeled as @xmath42 .",
    "to each vertex @xmath43 of the lattice we assign a three dimensional minkowski frame ( a copy of the lie algebra @xmath14 ) ; the role of the connection is played by 3-dimensional lorentz matrices @xmath44 that define parallel transport from vertex @xmath45 to vertex @xmath46 . in this way",
    "the configuration space of the lattice theory is @xmath47 .",

    "second , thanks to ( [ e =- me ] ) a geometric interpretation of the variables is possible .",
    "the links of the dual lattice are placed in the minkowski frames of the vertices of the original lattice ( dual faces ) according to the variables @xmath48 . and",
    "after gauss s law is satisfied ^i:=e_()^i+ e_()^i+  = 0 , [ j=0 ] the faces of the dual lattice close . to make this lattice gauge theory describe vacuum @xmath0 gravity we have to require that the curvature vanishes ; in other words , the parallel transport around every face of the lattice ( around every vertex of the dual lattice ) must be the identity .",
    "that is , _ j:=(*m*_*m*_ ",
    "*m*_)^i_j=^i_j , [ p=0 ] where the boundary of face @xmath50 is composed by the links @xmath51 . therefore the holonomy around _",
    "every contractible loop _ of the lattice is restricted to be the identity .",
    "the curvature constraint can be replaced by @xmath52 .",

    "( the weak equality indicates that we are restricting ourselves to the constraint surface ) .",
    "waelbroeck s constraints ( [ j=0 ] ) , ( [ p=0 ] ) are the precise analog of the witten constraints ( [ wittcon ] ) in the continuum .",
    "when the @xmath30 s are non - degenerate the constraints can be written in an equivalent ashtekar form .",
    "more precisely , when at every vertex @xmath43 the vector space generated by @xmath54 is at least two dimensional , the projected curvature constraints h _ ( ) & : = & b()^i e_()_i = 0 , [ ha ] + h()&:= & ^ijk b()_i ( e_()_j e_()_k + e_()_j e_()_k+  e_()_j e_()_k ) = 0 , [ h ] imply @xmath55 . ; the orientation of the faces is the one induced by the orientation of the lattice . ] hence , the constraints ( [ j=0 ] ) , ( [ ha ] ) and ( [ h ] ) , that are of the ashtekar type , form a first - class system .    the question of whether the projected constraints ( [ ha ] ) , ( [ h ] ) are equivalent to the covariant constraint ( [ p=0 ] ) is studied in the appendix .",
    "we consider the case of a square @xmath56 lattice with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath57 represented by rectangular grid ; in this case we prove that the two sets of constraints are equivalent if and only if @xmath8 and @xmath58 are odd . because of its interest in the case of a possible relation with regge calculus",
    ", we consider the case of three - valent lattices . these are lattices whose duals are triangular lattices .",
    "again there are cases of lattices where the covariant and projected versions of the constraints are not equivalent .",
    "however , given one of this lattices @xmath5 where the two sets of constraints are not equivalent we construct a new tri - valent lattice @xmath59 where the the projected constraints ( [ ha ] ) , ( [ h ] ) are equivalent to the covariant constraints ( [ p=0 ] ) .",
    "we know that any surface can be represented by a three - valent lattice ( because any surface can be triangulated ) .",
    "therefore we can represent any two dimensional space by a lattice where the covariant constraints are equivalent to the projected constraints , in the sector where the @xmath30 s are non - degenerate .",
    "the constraint ( [ h ] ) is the lattice version of the hamiltonian constraint ( it is linear in the curvature and quadratic in the momenta ) , while ( [ ha ] ) plays the role of the diffeomorphism constraint ( it is linear in the curvature and in the momenta ) .",
    "we see that algebraically ( [ ha ] ) takes care of the residual diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "geometrically the constraint is the generator of phase space symmetries that _ do _ correspond to translations of the vertices ( dual faces ) of the lattice .    in @xmath0 gravity",
    "the lattice theory is exact in the sense that it contains all the true degrees of freedom of the continuum theory .",
    "the number of variables of the phase space is @xmath60 , while the number of first - class constraints is @xmath61 .",
    "hence the dimension of the reduced phase space is 6n_1 - 2 ( 3n_0 + 3n_2 ) = 12 g -12 , where @xmath62 is the genus of space . in this lattice approach two different lattices with the same topology",
    "give rise to two descriptions of the same reduced phase space . in this subsection",
    "we have recalled waelbroeck s exact lattice formulation of @xmath0 gravity , and we have rewritten the constraints in a projected form . by the counting of degrees of freedom given above , we see that in a quantum theory based on an abstract lattice one needs to impose a diffeomorphism constraint to reproduce a classical theory with the correct number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this is the first remark of this paper .",
    "in this section , we will obtain the second result of the article .",
    "the section is divided in to three parts . in the first one , we give some heuristic arguments that suggest the existence of a residual diffeomorphism symmetry for theories defined on an abstract lattice . in the second part",
    ", we make a small detour and recall , for the continuum , the quantization of theories of connections that have a compact gauge group , such as gravity in @xmath63 dimensions and euclidean @xmath0 gravity . in the last part",
    ", we consider the quantization of the lattice formulation and compare it to the continuum .",
    "the issue of diffeomorphism invariance in the quantization of the lattice theory is a subtle one , since it is not apriory clear how to achieve a continuum limit which is compatible with diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the proposal that by working on an abstract lattice one automatically solves the diffeomorphism constraint is an attractive one .",
    "the idea is that by quantizing the gauge theory on an abstract lattice , one gets a family of states that should be mapped to some diffeomorphism invariant states after the continuum limit is taken .    in order to test the full physical viability of the theory one should wait for the construction of a consistent continuum limit and then compare its predictions with the ` known physics ' .",
    "however , there are general arguments that one can give , that do _ not _ depend on the details of the particular continuum limit that one selects .",
    "that is the aim of the second half of the paper .",
    "we want to argue that , roughly speaking , there are states defined over the lattice that should be identified in any continuum limit that recovers diffeomorphism invariance , and that are clearly distinct from the view - point of the abstract lattice .",
    "therefore , there is a residual diffeomorphism symmetry even when working in the abstract lattice .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the lattice of fig.1 , together with two loops @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "as loops defined on the lattice , they are clearly different . however , when seen as embedded in a manifold , there is a diffeomorphism that maps @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "one could expect that in a limit that recovers spatial diffeomorphisms , states defined over @xmath64 and @xmath65 are identified .",
    "the loops @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the loops are diffeomorphic but the states defined on them are different .    to make these intuitive arguments conclusive , we shall go in to the details of the quantization on the continuum , and later compare it to the quantization of the abstract lattice .      in the quantization of the continuum theory",
    ", we can follow the procedure introduced in @xcite for @xmath63 dimensions .",
    "the main steps are the introduction of a kinematical hilbert space where the quantum constraints are to be defined , and the construction of the hilbert space of solutions to the gauss and diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "one basic assumption in this program is that the holonomies of the connection @xmath13 are well defined operators in the kinematical hilbert space .",
    "this assumption leads to @xmath70 that ` completes ' the space of smooth connections @xmath71 , to form the _ quantum configuration space _ of ` generalized connections ' .    here",
    "we review the characterization of @xmath70 as a limit of a family of configuration spaces living on finite ` floating ' lattices @xcite . to each lattice @xmath5",
    "_ embedded _ in @xmath10 we assign a configuration space @xmath72 . a point in @xmath73",
    "is represented by @xmath74 , each group element @xmath75 is to be thought of as the path - ordered exponential of the connection along the link @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "the collection of all these configuration spaces corresponding to every lattice gives an _ over - complete _ description of @xmath70 .",
    "it is possible to keep track of all the repetition by means of a projective structure .",
    "we say that lattice @xmath5 is a refinement of lattice @xmath59 ( @xmath78 ) if every link @xmath79 either @xmath80 or @xmath81 for some @xmath82 . for any pair of lattices related by refinement",
    "@xmath78 there is a projection @xmath83 ( g_1,g_2,g_3,  ,g_n_1 ) ( g^_1=g_2g_1,g^_2 ,  , g^_n^_1 ) , where @xmath84 , @xmath79 , @xmath85 .",
    "the projection map and the refinement relation have two properties that will allow us to define @xmath70 as ` the configuration space of the finest lattice ' .",
    "first , we can check that @xmath86 .",
    "second , equipped with the refinement relation ` @xmath87 ' , the set of embedded lattices @xmath88 is a partially ordered , directed set ; i.e. for all @xmath5 , @xmath59 and @xmath89 in @xmath88 we have : ll;ll^l^l l = l^;ll^ l^l^ll^ ; and , given any @xmath90 , there exists @xmath91 such that ll^ll^.    the space @xmath70 is the _ projective limit _ of the projective family , defined as follows : : = \\{(a_l)_l _ la_l : l^l p_ll^a_l^=a_l}. that is , the projective limit is contained in the cartesian product of _ all _ possible configuration spaces @xmath73 , subject to the consistency conditions stated above .",
    "there is a canonical projection @xmath92 from the space @xmath70 to the spaces @xmath73 given by , p_l : _ l , p_l((a_l^ ) _ l^):=a_l .",
    "given any function @xmath93 defined on the space @xmath73 one can define a function on @xmath70 via the pull - back @xmath94 .",
    "such functions are called _ cylindrical _ , and the space of such functions is denoted by @xmath95 . in a similar fashion , we can define hilbert spaces for each space @xmath73 and ` pull them back ' to the projective limit .",
    "that is , we have a projective family of hilbert spaces @xmath96 .",
    "the final picture is that the kinematical hilbert space is the space of square integrable functions on @xmath70 with respect to a measure @xmath97 , that is , _",
    "kin:=l^2(,d ) .    in the case of compact gauge groups",
    "@xmath98 , the uniform haar measure @xmath99 on each copy of the group corresponding to the links , endows the hilbert space @xmath100 with a probability measure that is diffeomorphism invariant ( also denoted by @xmath99 ) .",
    "cylindrical functions define a dense subset on the hilbert space .",
    "it is important to point out that even though the states are associated to the lattice , the natural labels for them are graphs @xmath101 on @xmath5 .",
    "a ( closed ) graph @xmath101 is just a collection of links of the lattice @xmath5 .",
    "we shall therefore denote the states by @xmath102 , without explicitly writing down the lattice @xmath5 where @xmath101 lies .",
    "note that in this representation the connection is ` diagonal ' .",
    "more precisely , given a function @xmath103 defined on a lattice @xmath5 , for example the trace of the holonomy @xmath104 along a loop @xmath105 contained in @xmath5 , the corresponding operator will act by multiplication : ( _ _ ) ( |a):=t_(|a)_(|a ) .",
    "the next step involves defining the constraints on this hilbert space @xmath100 ; in practice we do it by defining the action of the constraints on @xmath95 and extend it to the whole @xmath100 . the first constraint we will consider is the gauss constraint , that generates gauge transformations .",
    "a finite gauge transformation takes the holonomy @xmath106 to @xmath107 ( where edge @xmath108 goes from vertex @xmath109 to vertex @xmath110 ) .",
    "the quantum gauss constraint should impose gauge invariance on the wave functions ; therefore , on a cylindrical function , @xmath111 , the gauss constraint takes the form , for each vertex @xmath109 of the lattice @xmath5 : _",
    "e_x^i_e__=0 , where @xmath112 is a right or left invariant vector field on the internal direction @xmath18 depending on whether the link @xmath113 is incoming or outgoing , respectively .",
    "gauge invariant functions on @xmath114 can be seen as functions on the quotient space of @xmath70 by the space of generalized gauge transformation @xmath115 .",
    "thus , @xmath116 is the hilbert space of solutions to the gauss constraint .",
    "it turns out that @xmath116 is not well suited to define the generator of diffeomorphisms ( see @xcite ) ; instead , we represent _ finite _ diffeomorphisms as unitary operators on the hilbert space .",

    "we want to define @xmath118 , to be a unitary operator . for any diffeomorphism invariant measure @xmath97",
    "we can define such representation , it will be given by , _ _ ( |a):=_^-1()(|a ) .",
    "that is , the induced action of @xmath119 is to ` move ' the graph @xmath101 by the inverse diffeomorphism .",
    "solutions to the diffeomorphism constraint will be those states that are left invariant by the unitary operators @xmath120",
    ". these states will _ not _ belong to the kinematical hilbert space @xmath100 .",
    "this is a general feature of the dirac quantization method for constrained systems , whenever the ` gauge group ' generated by the constraint to be imposed is non - compact .",
    "solutions to the diffeomorphism constraint are distributions , living on the dual space @xmath121 to the dense sub - space @xmath122 of gauge invariant , cylindrical functions .",
    "an element @xmath123 of @xmath121 is said to be a solution to the diffeomorphism constraint if |=| ( ) , where ` @xmath124 $ ] ' denotes the dual action , @xmath125=\\int_{{\\overline{\\cal a / g } } }   d\\mu\\,\\bar{\\phi}\\psi$ ] .",
    "one can construct such distributions by ` group averaging ' over the group @xmath126 .",
    "the infinite size of @xmath126 makes a precise definition of the group average procedure very subtle ; here we follow the procedure given in @xcite . an inner product for the space of solutions",
    "is given by the same formula that defines the group averaging ; therefore , a summation over all the elements of @xmath126 would yield states with infinite norm . in this sense , prescribing an adequate definition for the averaging over the group @xmath126 involves some ` renormalization . '",
    "we shall give the details below .",
    "an appropriate definition of the group averaging procedure follows from two observations .",
    "first , the inner product between two states induced by the cylindrical functions @xmath127 must be zero unless there is a diffeomorphism @xmath128 that connects the two graphs @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "second , the construction of generalized connections assigns group elements to un - parametrized edges .",
    "therefore , two diffeomorphisms that restricted to a graph @xmath129 are equal except for a reparametrization of the edges of @xmath129 should be counted only once in the construction of group averaging of states based on graph @xmath129 .",

    "in the lattice construction , the hilbert spaces of two different classes of lattices have a non - trivial intersection ( due to the subtlety mentioned before ) , so the sum is not direct .",
    "thus , @xmath149}$ ] _ do _ span the hilbert space @xmath141 , but we have lost the orthogonal decomposition that was available for graphs .    we should emphasize that although one is working with finite lattices and the hilbert spaces defined on them , there is no ` continuum limit ' to be taken . by considering all the possible finite lattices we are _ already _ in the continuum .",
    "let us recall that in the ordinary lattice formulation of gauge theories , we have _ one _ lattice on which the theory is defined .",
    "the continuum limit is recovered by taking the limit of the ` lattice spacing ' going to zero .",
    "when dealing with diffeomorphism invariant theories one has to be more careful since the notion of lattice spacing does not have an invariant meaning .",
    "one has to device more subtle ways of recovering the continuum theory .    given the abstract lattice @xmath154 , the configuration space @xmath155 is given by @xmath39 copies of the group @xmath98 , corresponding to the matrices of parallel transport along the @xmath39 links of the lattice .",
    "coordinates for the ` momenta ' are naturally given by elements of the lie algebra @xmath62 that label the right or left invariant vector fields @xmath156 on the @xmath76 copy of the gauge group @xmath98 .",
    "the natural representation is to choose wave functions @xmath157 on the @xmath39 copies of the group : @xmath158 .",
    "the hilbert space is @xmath159 , where the measure @xmath97 is given by the haar measure .",
    "the momenta @xmath30 are represented by , _",
    "e_i^i :=- i x^i_e_i .[mop ] the imposition of the gauss constraint follows very closely that of the continuum , the condition of the wave functions being -i_e_x^i_e_=0 , where @xmath160 is a left or right invariant vector field depending on our choice of @xmath161 or @xmath162 to denote the momenta associated to the link @xmath163 .    mathematically , this representation is _ identical _ to the hilbert space @xmath96 of the continuum for any embedding @xmath5 of the lattice @xmath164 into @xmath10 .",
    "one can prove that there is an isomorphism @xmath165}$ ] from the hilbert space constructed from the abstract lattice to the hilbert space of diffeomorphism invariant states @xmath149}$ ] .",
    "but comparison of the two descriptions should be made between the hilbert space @xmath141 and the ( ` continuum ' ) limit of the spaces @xmath166 in which the abstract lattice @xmath164 fills all space .",
    "the fact that a definite procedure to take the continuum limit has not been completed does not prevent us from drawing some qualitative results .",
    "we now make the argument that we presented in part a precise , concluding that there is a residual diffeomorphism symmetry in the discretized theory :    * there are states @xmath167 that are identified by @xmath126 and such that the corresponding states in @xmath168 are different @xmath169 ( see fig .",
    "this corresponds to the case discussed in sec .",
    "iii.b , where two states are related by a diffeomorphism and therefore , identified in the continuum theory , but the lattices on which they are defined are _ not _ related by a diffeomorphism",
    ". the construction works for any pair of lattices @xmath164 , @xmath5 such that @xmath170 , where @xmath6=l_0 $ ] , and gives the same answer .",
    "this demonstrates that the continuum limit of the hilbert spaces @xmath168 would be too big to be physically correct .",
    "this discussion allows us to reach our conclusion : when working with a theory defined on an abstract lattice , we still have to get rid of the residual diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "this is the second result of this paper .",
    "let us briefly summarize our results .",
    "we have discussed the issue of diffeomorphisms on lattice formulations of theories of connections .",
    "the case of @xmath0 gravity is tailored for this comparison .",
    "it is a theory with only global degrees of freedom that are fully incorporated in the lattice theory even before taking the continuum limit .",
    "the imposition of the continuum limit is in this case almost trivial allowing us to draw general qualitative conclusions without the difficulties that one encounters in @xmath63 lattice gravity @xcite . in the case of the waelbroeck - witten formulation , after imposing the curvature constraint ( [ p=0 ] ) the resulting quantum theory , just as in the case of the continuum , will be given by gauge invariant functions having support on flat connections .",
    "for the ashtekar constraints , one expects the quantum theory to be closely related to the flat case .",
    "this expectation is based on the fact that for non - degenerate @xmath30 s ( geometrodynamic sector ) the two sets of constraints are equivalent . in the classical theory only if both the ` diffeomorphism ' ( [ h ] ) and the ` hamiltonian ' ( [ ha ] ) constraints are imposed , the theory describes flat connections and has the correct @xmath171 topological degrees of freedom .",
    "this example shows that there _ is _ a residual diffeomorphism invariance and it has to be taken care of by means of more constraints .",
    "if we only consider the ` hamiltonian constraint ' ( [ ha ] ) , and do not impose the quantum ` translation constraints ' ( [ h ] ) , we will end up with a theory very far from the one describing flat connections ; it will have _ local _ degrees of freedom .",
    "we have reviewed , in certain detail , the quantization of the continuum theory in order to show that , mathematically , the quantization on the abstract lattice is equivalent to a certain _ subspace _ of the hilbert space of the continuum . using this framework , we could give examples of states that are identified in the continuum theory , but that are not automatically identified in the quantization of a theory based on an abstract lattice .",
    "thus , this leads us to conclude that the quantum lattice theory has a residual diffeomorphism symmetry that should be taken care of .",
    "we would like to thank r. loll , j. pullin and specially a. ashtekar for discussions and suggestions .",
    "both authors were supported by universidad nacional autnoma de mxico ( dgapa , unam ) .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grants phy-9396246 , phy-9423950 , phy-9514240 , by the eberly research fund of penn state university and the alfred p. sloan foundation .",
    "consider a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. a grid of @xmath58 rows by @xmath8 columns on a planar representation of @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath58 and @xmath8 are odd , then @xmath172 for every vertex @xmath173 of the lattice implies @xmath174 for every face @xmath175 of the lattice . that follows after proving that the system of equations defined by @xmath176 can be inverted .",
    "the formula for @xmath177 is p(f_kl)^i= _",
    "ij c_kl(ij ) b(v_ij)^i [ p = p(b ) ] where @xmath178 and the sign is given in figure ( 2a ) .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath58 or @xmath8 are even , the system is not invertible and @xmath179 does not imply @xmath180 .",
    "now we see why invertibility requires an odd number of rows . in formula ( [ p = p(b ) ] ) we would have for @xmath181 that the coefficients @xmath182 with @xmath183 and @xmath184 are given by : @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , ... , @xmath191 .",
    "with the consistency condition @xmath192 that forces @xmath58 to be an odd number .",
    "the same argument shows that the number of columns should be odd .",
    "now we study the case of a lattice with vertices of valence three .",
    "again there are cases of lattices where @xmath193 does not imply @xmath194 , this occurs in general for lattices with many symmetries .",
    "our result is the following : consider any finite three - valent lattice @xmath5 where there is a vertex @xmath195 ( dual face ) such that @xmath196 but @xmath197 for some of the three faces @xmath198 that contain vertex @xmath199 .",
    "the three - valent lattice @xmath59 constructed replacing vertex @xmath195 by three vertices @xmath200 ( see figure ( 2b ) ) is such that @xmath193 implies @xmath194 .",
    "first we prove that @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the vector space of the curvature vectors of all the faces @xmath203 of the lattice restricted to the condition @xmath193 for every vertex @xmath204 .",
    "since @xmath5 is finite , we can number its vertices leaving @xmath195 at the end @xmath205 , and in such a way that vertex @xmath206 for @xmath207 is joined by an edge of @xmath5 to @xmath208 with @xmath209 ( if the lattice is not connected , we can prove our result independently for its connected components ) . denote the curvature vectors of the faces containing the first vertex by @xmath210 .",
    "@xmath211 implies @xmath212 and @xmath213 implies that @xmath214 ; then we use @xmath215 to see @xmath216 , etc ( see figure ( 2c ) ) . in this way",
    "we see that all the free parameters in @xmath217 are @xmath218 , which proves @xmath201 .",
    "now we see that @xmath219 .",
    "in constructing @xmath59 from @xmath5 we generated only one new face ( see figure(2b ) ) .",
    "therefore , the construction given above parameterizes the curvature vectors of all the faces of @xmath59 except for one . and the conditions @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 demand @xmath223 , which concludes our proof .",
