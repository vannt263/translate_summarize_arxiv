    "a challenge lies in the fact that clusters are dominated by dark matter , which accounts for @xmath5 of the mass of the universe . while the distribution of dark matter in clusters can accurately be predicted using @xmath0-body simulations , it is difficult to relate the dark matter distribution with observable characteristics of clusters , such as gas temperatures , optical / x - ray luminosities , and member galaxy distributions , because it involves many complicated physical processes associated with gas cooling / heating and star formations .",
    "indeed , recent cosmological constraints from x - ray analysis of clusters has mainly been limited by various astrophysical uncertainties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "weak gravitational lensing provides a direct probe of dark matter distributions in clusters .",

    "this stacked lensing technique has been applied to the sloan digital sky survey data to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters @xcite , and will offer a promising mass - calibration method in future wide - field optical imaging surveys @xcite .",
    "in addition , stacked lensing signals much beyond virial radii probe clustering of massive haloes , which contains complementary information on halo masses @xcite .",
    "weak lensing also provides a fascinating way to identify massive haloes in a way unbiased to the physical state of the baryon , by searching for peaks in the mass map reconstructed from lensing shear measurements @xcite .",
    "this idea has been applied to real data to demonstrate that massive clusters can indeed be identified @xcite .",
    "such shear - selected cluster catalogs not only offer a unique opportunity to study the relation between mass and light in a statistical manner ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also may provide an alternative way to constrain cosmological parameters through number counts of peaks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the interpretation of weak lensing data is usually made by comparing observed signals with analytical model predictions . for the analytic calculations of lensing properties",
    ", it is customary to adopt a density profile proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) .",
    "the nfw profile has widely been used to extract information on cluster masses from weak lensing data .",
    "however , results of such analysis can be biased if the assumption on the nfw profile is not accurate .",
    "for instance , lensing signals are determined by all matter distributions along the line - of - sight , which cause the scatter and bias in mass estimates @xcite , which can modify lensing signals particularly at large radii .",
    "indeed , earlier work using @xmath0-body simulations has found the significant contribution of correlated matter around haloes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "if the true density profile deviates from the nfw profile , it can also cause a systematic bias .",
    "understanding such bias is clearly important for attempts to use clusters as a cosmological probe .    in this paper , we investigate cluster lensing profiles in details using a large set of ray - tracing in @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we pay particular attention to lensing profiles around virial radii where the origin of lensing signals should change from main haloes to the correlated matter around clusters .",
    "thanks to the large number of ray - tracing realisations , we can study lensing profiles out to very large radii , typically several tens time virial radii of clusters .",
    "we consider an analytic model that better fit the simulated signals , which is then used to explore potential biases of several weak lensing studies originating from the assumption of the nfw profile .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : theory ] we present analytic models adopted in the paper .",
    "detailed comparisons with ray - tracing simulations are made in section  [ sec : rayt ] . using the analytic model calibrated by the ray - tracing , we study potential biases in various lens studies in section  [ sec : bias ] .",
    "we summarise the results in section  [ sec : summary ] . in appendices  [ sec :",
    "bmo ] and [ sec : fourier ] , we provide formulae which should be useful for various calculations with the smoothly truncated nfw profile .",
    "in this paper , we study the radial profiles of the convergence and tangential shear around clusters . at small scales the profiles are dominated by the signals from the dark haloes associated with the clusters ( the so - called 1-halo term ) .",
    "the current most popular model of the dark halo density profile is the profile proposed by nfw , which is defined by the following form ( hereafter the nfw profile ) : @xmath6 the density parameter @xmath7 is related to the virial mass @xmath8 defined such that the average density within the virial radius becomes equal to the nonlinear overdensity @xmath9 , which we compute using the spherical collapse model ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , times the mean matter density of the universe .",

    "a well - known advantage of the nfw profile in lensing studies is that there are analytic expressions for the radial profiles of the deflection angle , convergence , and shear @xcite .",
    "however , the nfw profile is not well - defined in the sense that the enclosed mass diverges logarithmically .",
    "thus @xcite considered lensing by the nfw profile truncated at the virial radius ( hereafter the tj profile ) : @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the heaviside step function .",
    "the lensing properties of this profile can also be computed analytically ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    one potential problem of the tj profile is that the shear and convergence profiles are not differentiable at the truncation radius , which causes the divergence in the flexion profile .",
    "@xcite proposed a different form of the truncation ( hereafter the bmo profile ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the truncation radius . in the paper",
    "we mainly use the following dimensionless truncation radius @xmath20 while both @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been considered in @xcite , in this paper we consider only @xmath23 for simplicity . in the case , at large radii the density profile behaves as @xmath24 , and therefore the enclosed mass converges quickly .",

    "this virial mass @xmath8 , strictly speaking , is different from a true virial mass defined from the requirement of the nonlinear overdensity .",
    "however , one advantage of this choice of the normalisation is that the `` virial mass '' of this model , @xmath8 , becomes rather close to the total mass @xmath28 . from the definition above , we can show that these two masses are related by ( again for @xmath23 ) @xmath29 @xmath30 .",

    "is computed using the approximation of the transfer function presented by @xcite .",

    "we compute the mass for @xmath45 assuming the nfw profile ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to study the detailed radial profiles of lensing signals around massive haloes , we employ a large set of ray - tracing simulations presented by @xcite .",
    "the ray - tracing simulations are based on @xmath47 realisations of @xmath0-body simulations with the box sizes of 240 ( particle mass @xmath48 ) and @xmath49mpc ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "it has been known that very central density profiles of dark haloes in @xmath0-body simulations are not reliable because of several numerical effects such as the two - body relaxation and the finite time step size .",

    "as clearly shown in the figure , the bmo profile reproduce profiles in the ray - tracing simulations quite successfully for a wide range in radii .",
    "in contrast , the nfw and tj profiles are less successful in fitting the profile around the virial radius , where the transition between 1-halo and 2-halo terms occurs .",

    "the figure also indicates that the analytic and simulated convergence profiles agree well with each other down to very small radii of @xmath93 , whereas the tangential shear profiles show large deviations already at @xmath94 .",
    "one reason for this is that shear signals are non - local .",
    "since the tangential shear signal at certain radius reflects all the mass distributions at smaller radii , numerical effects appear at larger radii in the tangential shear profiles than in the convergence profiles .",

    "we find that the bmo profile , which is essentially a smoothly truncated nfw profile , with the truncation radius of @xmath151 with additional contribution from the 2-halo term best reproduces the lensing profiles in ray - tracing simulations .",
    "in contrast , the untruncated nfw profile tends to overpredict the convergence profiles by @xmath152 at twice the virial radii when the 2-halo term is added .",
    "the tj ( hard - truncation ) profile largely underpredicts the lensing signals at around the virial radii .",
    "next , assuming the bmo profile with the 2-halo term as the `` true '' cluster lensing profile , we have investigated biases in cluster weak lens studies coming from the adoption of the nfw profile as an analytic model .",
    "we find that , if observed reduced shear profiles are fitted by a single nfw component , as has commonly been done in cluster weak lensing analysis , we can underestimate cluster masses up to @xmath153 .",
    "the bias is most significant when the outer boundary for fitting is set to @xmath2 depending on the mass and redshift of the cluster , or equivalently several times the virial radius .",
    "we can reduce the bias by restricting the fitting range small with the outer boundary equal or smaller than the virial radius .",
    "on the other hand , the concentration parameter tends to be biased high ( up to @xmath3 or even higher ) to compensate the underestimate of the mass .",
    "these results based on the analytic model appear to be consistent with recent numerical results by @xcite .",
    "in the reduced shear fitting above , we have considered only intrinsic shapes of galaxies as a source of the error , i.e. , ignored the contribution of the large - scale structure ( cosmic shear ) to the error ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the error from the large - scale structure becomes increasingly important at larger radii , and thus decreases the relative weight of bins at large radii , implying that it reduces the bias in the mass and concentration parameter estimates .",
    "the exact amount of the reduction of the bias , however , depends on the source galaxy number density assumed . in real cluster",
    "weak lensing analysis , colour cuts have often been applied in order to minimise the dilution effect by cluster member galaxies , which significantly decreases source galaxy number densities used for the analysis .",
    "because of this , the contribution of the large - scale structure to the total error budget tends to be subdominant in real data analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the large - scale structure should still contribute significantly at very large radii , e.g. , @xmath154 .",
    "we have also examined the effect of the outer lensing profile on the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath145 of weak lensing mass peaks .",
    "we have considered two different filters , and found that @xmath145 can be biased by @xmath4 for peaks with @xmath155 by adopting a single nfw component in calculating @xmath145 .",
    "although this level of the bias is not so large , it can be important in detailed comparisons of observed mass peaks with theory in the future .",
    "while in this paper we have focused on biases due to modeling uncertainty of the outer lensing profiles , there are other effects that could also bias the weak lensing analysis . among others ,",
    "the halo triaxiality could have the most significant impact .",
    "indeed , the large triaxiality of cluster - scale haloes suggests that the lensing signal is a strong function of the viewing angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we expect that the effect is almost averaged out by proper statistical analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the exact amount of the residual bias due to the triaxiality should be sensitive to how the cluster sample is selected .",
    "we note that the analytic model considered in the paper is subject to a potential improvement .",
    "for instance , the 2-halo term considered in the paper is accurate in the large - scale limit .",
    "near the cluster we may have to consider various effects such as non - linearity and stochasticity of the halo bias for more accurate theoretical prediction .",
    "in addition , for more robust separation of signals between the main halo and correlated matter , it is important to compare the three - dimensional matter distribution around clusters with projected lensing signals , which is left for future work .    nevertheless , our analytic models presented in the paper , which has been tested against a large set of ray - tracing simulations , should be useful for various aspects of cluster weak lensing studies as a handy model of realistic lensing profiles in @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "in particular , we expect that they are invaluable in the stacked weak lensing study for which lensing signals can be detected much beyond the virial radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "given an important cosmological information coming from the 2-halo term ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is essential to have a proper analytic model which accurately predicted signals from the 1-halo to 2-halo terms , in order for an unbiased interpretation of stacked lensing data .",
    "the model is also useful for studying the effect of the outer profile uncertainty ( including the contribution from correlated matter around clusters ) on various cluster weak lensing analysis , as explicitly demonstrated in the paper for shear profile fitting and weak lensing mass peaks .",
