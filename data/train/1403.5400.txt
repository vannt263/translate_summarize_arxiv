    "nuclear scattering is the most important phenomena from which we can obtain information and knowledge on various nuclear properties .",
    "many theoretical approaches and experimental techniques have been developed to extract physics from the scattering phenomena .",
    "resonances observed as some peaks in scattering cross sections provide us with the precious information for understanding nuclear interactions and structures .",
    "in particular , it is indispensable in recent developments of unstable nuclear physics to investigate the resonances involved in the unbound states locating above the many - particle decay thresholds , because the unstable nuclei barely have bound states and most of the excited states are resonances .",
    "furthermore , to understand weakly bound states in unstable nuclei , such as a halo structure , we need to investigate continuum states together with bound states because of a strong coupling between them @xcite .",
    "study of resonances in the scattering problem of light nuclei has been carried out by using various methods , one of which is the complex scaling method ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "the theory of the complex scaling was proposed mathematically @xcite and it has been extensively applied to the atomic and nuclear physics @xcite . in the csm",
    ", resonant states of the many - body systems are described using the appropriate @xmath2 basis functions .",
    "the resonance wave functions are obtained as eigenstates together with bound states by carrying out the diagonalization of the complex scaled hamiltonian .",
    "hence , we can calculate expectation values of physical quantities for resonances @xcite .",
    "recently , resonances decaying up to five - body systems have been studied in the csm and successfully compared with experiments @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed that the csm is very useful in studies of not only resonant states but also scattering states @xcite .",
    "the complex scaling separates the resonant states with resonance energies @xmath3 and widths @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) from the continuum states obtained on a @xmath6-line , where @xmath7 is a scaling angle in the csm @xcite .",
    "we can extract scattering properties from the continuum solutions on the @xmath6-line together with the resonance solutions .",
    "calculations of the phase shifts of continuum states with complex energies along the @xmath6-line provide the background phase shifts exclusive of the resonances existing in the energy region between the @xmath6-line and the real energy axis @xcite . as examples of applications of the csm to scattering problems ,",
    "response functions for external electric fields and breakup cross sections of two - neutron halo nuclei have been discussed and shown for observed data to be well described by a two - neutron - plus - core three - body model @xcite . in their results , it is concluded that a sequential breakup process is dominant rather than a direct three - body breakup .    in these calculations ,",
    "a complex scaled green s function has been introduced to obtain the response functions as observables .",
    "we can also calculate scattering quantities such as phase shifts in a form of sum of resonances and background terms .",
    "it is possible to investigate the resonance contributions and to obtain a deep understanding of resonance structure by separation of a scattering quantity .",
    "@xcite showed that scattering phase shifts can be calculated from the continuum level density ( cld ) which is expressed using the complex scaled green s function .",
    "the cld is also called a time delay and has a relation with the @xmath8-matrix @xcite . in the csm",
    ", we obtain the discretized continuum states as complex energy eigenstates . using those complex eigen - energies",
    ", we can evaluate the cld as a smoothed real - energy function .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the explicit relation between the scattering phase shifts and complex - energy eigenvalues in the csm via the cld .",
    "the results provide us with deeper understanding of the role of resonant states characterised by the widths described as an imaginary part of the eigen - energy .",
    "we show the results of typical potential scattering which has many resonances near the real energy .",
    "we also analyze the several realistic systems and compare the results with the observed data .",
    "the observed scattering cross sections have various energy distributions as a result of interference between resonance and background terms of phase shifts @xcite .",
    "we see this interference in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 systems .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , the method is briefly explained , and the scattering phase shifts are explicitly shown by using the complex energy solutions in the csm . in section iii ,",
    "the present method is applied to several two - body systems ; a typical potential problem , so called gyarmati potential @xcite is discussed .",
    "the phase shifts of @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems are presented together with experimental ones .",
    "finally , in section iv , discussion and summary are given .",
    "we take up two - body systems which are described by the schrdinger equation @xmath9 where the hamiltonian @xmath10 consists of kinetic energy @xmath11 and potential @xmath12 for the relative motion between two bodies .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is generally solved under a boundary condition of asymptotic out - going waves for bound states and resonances .",
    "the out - going boundary condition directly enables us to solve bound states in an @xmath2 functional basis set because the states have negative energies and a damping behavior in the asymptotic region .",
    "resonant states are unbound and defined as the eigenstates belonging to the complex eigen - energy which corresponds to a complex momentum value in the lower half plane ( unphysical plane @xcite ) .",
    "the resonant states can not be solved in the @xmath2 functional space due to asymptotically divergent behavior .",
    "furthermore , continuum states of arbitrary positive energies can not also be obtained under the out - going condition .",
    "the complex scaling has been introduced to solve resonant states within @xmath2 basis functions , and is defined by the following complex - dilatation transformation for relative coordinate @xmath13 and momentum @xmath14 @xcite ; @xmath15 where @xmath7 is a scaling angle and @xmath16 .",
    "the maximum value @xmath17 is determined so as to keep analyticity of the potential .",

    "this transformation makes every branch cut rotated by @xmath19 on the complex energy plane . in the wedge region pinched by the rotated branch cut and the positive energy axis ,",

    "the bound states are obtained on the negative energy axis independently from @xmath7 as well as the ordinary bound states . because of a finite number of basis states , the continuum states are discretized with complex energies distributed on the rotated branch cut ( @xmath6-line ) .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the complex scaled schrdinger equation ( [ eq2 - 3 ] ) are classified as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the number of bound states and the number of resonant states which depends on @xmath7 , respectively .",
