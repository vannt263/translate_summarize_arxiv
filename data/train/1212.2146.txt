    "the collection of all powers of an ideal contains many structures .",

    "we turn the cellular resolutions minimal by another round of discrete morse theory .",
    "these minimal cellular resolutions are no longer , but almost , polyhedral : the subdivided simplex only has non - polyhedral cells close to the boundary and , for large powers , most of the cellular complex is merely a subdivided simplex .    along the way , we provide , in proposition [ prop : base ] , an @xmath1dimensional cellular resolution for all powers of edge ideals of bipartite graphs on @xmath0 vertices .",
