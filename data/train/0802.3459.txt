    "the assumption of poisson arrivals is usually valid in modeling traffic in communications @xcite .",
    "there is well - developed mathematical theory justifying such an assumption .",
    "also , it is often assumed that the service time of a server in a queuing system is exponential . in the case of telephone traffic ,",
    "the service time is the time for which a subscriber engages the equipment of interest . in a packet - switching network ,",
    "the service time is the transmission time and is therefore proportional to the packet length .",
    "it is difficult to give a sound theoretical reason why service times should be exponential , but the fact in most cases they are very nearly exponential @xcite . for design and analysis purpose ,",
    "it is desirable to estimate accurately the load currently generated by each device inter - connected in a network .",
    "for example , the rate of packets generated by a terminal or the size of packets .",
    "conventional advice recommends approximating the poisson arrival rate @xmath0 as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of arrivals during an interval of time with length @xmath3 .",
    "the problem with this method is that we do not know how accurate the estimate is .",
    "moreover , we have difficulty in choosing the length @xmath3 to guarantee a certain accuracy .",
    "observing over - long time interval is wasteful . on the other side",
    ", inadequate observation will lead to poor estimate .",
    "situations are similar for estimating the average service time @xmath4 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath4 is calculated as @xmath5 where @xmath6 are i.i.d .",
    "observations of service time . for the purpose of accuracy evaluation ,",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath7 is estimated as @xmath8 it should be noted that such an estimate of standard deviation is not a good measure of accuracy , since itself is also a random variable .",
    "an alternative of accuracy evaluation is confidence interval construction .",
    "the limitation of standard deviation estimation and confidence interval construction is that they are only post - experimental evaluation of accuracy based on fixed number of observations .",
    "these two conventional methods do not control the accuracy of estimation because the error is determined once the number of experiments is fixed .",
    "there are two natural methods of error control .",
    "first , one can specify an absolute error bound @xmath9 and confidence parameter @xmath10 and determine the sample size @xmath2 such that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an estimate of the parameter @xmath13 ( e.g. , poisson arrival rate or average service time ) .",
    "second , one can specify a relative error bound @xmath14 and confidence parameter @xmath10 and determine the sample size @xmath2 such that @xmath15 the problem with the first method is that it is not feasible to determine the sample size without a priori information of the parameter .",
    "moreover , an absolute error bound is not a good indicator of the precision of the estimate .",
    "the second method is better since a perfect measure would be expressed in terms of a relative error bound .",
    "more importantly , the sample size can be determined without any information of the parameter to be estimated .",
    "to estimate the arrival rate of a poisson process , we have    [ pora ] define function @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the least integer such that @xmath18 observe a sequence of @xmath2 interarrival times @xmath19 .",
    "define @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath21    since all @xmath2 inter - arrival times are i.i.d .",
    "exponential random variables with parameter @xmath0 , the characteristic function of the average inter - arrival time , denoted by @xmath22 , is @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath25 which implies that @xmath26 possesses a chi - square distribution of degree @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "notice that @xmath29 thus @xmath30 making use of the relation between the chi - square distribution and the poisson distribution ( see @xcite ) , we have @xmath31 hence , by the definition of function @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 the proof is thus completed .",
    "a remarkable fact is that no a priori information about the arrival rate @xmath0 is required to compute the sample size for pre - specified relative error bound and confidence level .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the sample size required to obtain an estimate of the poisson arrival rate with pre - specified relative accuracy ( quantified by relative error bound @xmath34 ) and confidence level .",
    "it can be seen from figure 1 that , to obtain an estimate @xmath35 such that @xmath36 we need to observe @xmath37 inter - arrival times @xmath19 and compute @xmath20 .",
    "to estimate the average of exponential service time , we have      let @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath43 possesses a chi - square distribution of degree @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "notice that @xmath44 moreover , @xmath45 because @xmath46 it follows that @xmath47 making use of the relation between the chi - square distribution and the poisson distribution , we have @xmath48 .",
    "recall the definition of function @xmath32 , we have @xmath49 the proof is thus completed .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the sample size required to obtain an estimate of the average service time with pre - specified relative accuracy ( quantified by relative error bound @xmath34 ) and confidence level .",
