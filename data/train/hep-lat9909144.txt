    "with the rise of perfect lattice gauge actions , inverse blocking @xcite has become a viable tool in numerical lattice field theory . a natural requirement for the action",
    "is that a classical solution , if interpolated in this way , remains classical on all finer lattices .",
    "equilibrium configurations are not classical , nevertheless , a topological charge can be unambiguously assigned to the interpolating field @xcite for generic lattice configurations .",
    "this has led to the hope to describe the topological ( instanton ) structure of monte carlo ( mc ) configurations with the help of the new method .",
    "our variant of rg smoothing @xcite consists of ( 1 ) coarse graining a mc configuration ( blocking in order to strip off uv fluctuations of scale @xmath3 ) and ( 2 ) inverse blocking to interpolate it by a smooth configuration ( sm ) on the original lattice .",
    "rg - smoothing by our method does not lead to classical configurations .",
    "clustering of topological charge and action in dominantly ( anti)selfdual clusters @xcite is a property of sm lattice fields inherited from the mc vacuum . smoothed fields preserve the string tension , its abelian dominance and contain a topological susceptibility of the right magnitude . in earlier work we were concentrating on the monopole content @xcite of sm configurations in certain gauges , relating it to the topological charge distribution and to other gauge - invariant signatures . in our present study on sm samples at @xmath1",
    "we found the dimensionless ratio @xmath4 , remarkably independent of @xmath5 , in the maximal abelian and laplacian gauges ( @xmath6 monopole density , @xmath7 topological susceptibility ) .",
    "coming back to the topological structure of the @xmath2 vacuum , we have explored new capabilities of the rg smoothing technique : ( 1 ) to study the gauge invariant field strength correlators at finite temperature @xcite and , more recently , at @xmath1 , ( 2 ) to investigate further the clustering of topological charge ( started in @xcite with a study of correlations in euclidean and in color space ) . for the perfect action used in our studies",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the gauge invariant field strength correlator @xcite , _ , ( x_1-x_2 ) = 0| \\ { g_(x_1 ) s(x_1,x_2 ) + g_(x_2 ) s^(x_1,x_2 ) } |0 describes the non - perturbative vacuum structure in a model - independent way .",
    "decomposing it into two basic structure functions , _ , ( x ) = ( _ _ - _ _ ) ( d(x^2 ) + d_1(x^2 ) ) + + ( x_x _ _ + x_x _ _ - ... ) , exposes a confining part @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is related to the dominance of ( anti)selfdual local excitations @xcite contributing to it . using smoothing ( instead of cooling @xcite ) we want to study eventual effects of smoothing as a noise reduction method on the topological content .",
    "the `` schwinger line '' @xmath10 , a path dependent transporter , requires ( for distances not on - axis on the lattice ) to perform a random sampling of paths of shortest length .",
    "we have measured at finite @xmath11 electric and magnetic structure functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 at space - like distances for samples of @xmath16 smoothed @xmath17 configurations at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( a temperature interval @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath30 has been calibrated using the zero temperature @xmath2 string tension by comparison with the monopole creutz ratios which reach a plateau early on a @xmath31 lattice ( except for @xmath32 ) . for @xmath1 the same functions have been studied on @xmath31 sm configurations at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 fm ) corresponding to the deconfinement @xmath35 found on @xmath17 @xcite for this action .    in the confinement phase ,",
    "the finite temperature correlators have an almost perfect electric - magnetic symmetry , even on our unsymmetric lattice .",
    "the signal of the deconfining transition is the breakdown of @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "1 ) .     + ( a ) ( b ) +",
    "a fit with exponential structure functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 does nt give a satisfactory description for all @xmath11 .",
    "in @xcite we solve the equations defining @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this leads to condensates and _ integrated _ correlation lengths given in table 1 .",
    "[ tab : expfit ]    .fit of condensates and integrated correlation lengths . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for @xmath1 we find @xmath41 and @xmath42 compatible with the lowest temperature there .",
    "the values of the correlation lengths are in the expected ballpark . in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath43 the transition appears as the result of continuous changes . the degree of ( anti)selfduality begins to decrease already below the deconfining transition @xcite . for a better understanding",
    "a detailed comparison with the cooling method ( presently not available for @xmath2 ) is under way .",
    "the uncorrelated instanton liquid provides a good description of the qcd ground state .",
    "there are no indications from the field strength correlator at @xmath1 @xcite for strong correlations between ( anti)instantons ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) . at higher temperatures interactions",
    "are expected to be important in the instanton ensemble .",
    "contrary to fermionic interactions , anstze for gluonic interactions rely on specific @xmath46 and @xmath47 superpositions . analyzing the clustered sm configurations we hoped to learn about instantons in the real yang mills vacuum . instead of supporting the instanton liquid picture",
    "our results are more suggestive for a different interpretation of the clusters exposed by smoothing .    the charge density has been measured by means of lscher s charge which is inexpensive for sm configurations .",
    "we have defined topological clusters using a @xmath48 site percolation algorithm for assigning neighboring ( same sign ) lattice sites , marked to have @xmath49 ( threshold ) , to the same cluster .",
    "clusters are characterized by a center ( identified by @xmath50 ) , a cluster volume @xmath51 and cluster charge @xmath52 .",
    "eventual color correlations between different clusters can be studied by the normalized _ cluster overlap _ for a pair of clusters , = with the field strength correlator between the centers involved .",
    "correlators of specified components would give , for instanton pairs , access to the relative color orientation matrix @xmath53 .",
    "the overlap @xmath54 ( 2 ) can be identified with the adjoint trace @xmath55 . for random orientations",
    "the average of @xmath54 over all pairs would vanish .",
    "plotting the average for different pairs as a function of the distance shows that the clusters are _ not uncorrelated _",
    "this average is sensitive to deviations of the histogram of @xmath56 from the haar measure .",
    "maximizing the overlap by a gauge rotation one can find @xmath53 for each pair .",
    "this method can be applied in all instanton finding studies .",
    "our analysis has shown for @xmath46 pairs strong _ aligning _ correlations in the confined phase ( decreasing with distance ) but none for @xmath47 pairs and _ aligning _ correlations _ similar _ for both types of pairs in the deconfined phase .",
    "a recent @xmath1 study confirms strong @xmath46 correlations and rather weak ones for @xmath47 .",
    "these results are difficult to reconcile with any instanton picture .",
    "therefore we have carefully studied the influence of the cutoff @xmath57 ( over an interval of space filling fraction between 1 and 10 % ) on the cluster composition .",
    "the cluster multiplicity goes through a maximum before a cluster percolation transition towards huge and multiply charged clusters is observed . with a cutoff keeping the cluster multiplicity below the maximum we get clustering properties being rather cutoff independent ( apart from distance correlations between centers ) with an almost poissonian multiplicity distribution .",
    "for instance , on the @xmath31 lattice at @xmath33 ( @xmath58 ) we find for @xmath59 an average number of clusters of @xmath60 .",
    "a strong correlation exists relating charge and volume , @xmath61 ( with almost all @xmath62 ) .",
    "if these clusters identified on sm configurations by lscher s charge could be interpreted as subclusters of instantons ( `` instanton quarks''= half - instantons for @xmath2 ) this would explain the unexpected pattern of color correlations .",
    "equal sign clusters would be bound into instantons ( dipoles ) in the confinement phase .",
    "they could dissociate in the deconfined phase with opposite charge correlations becoming of equal importance .",
    "further investigations are worthwhile , relating this to the behavior of the field strength correlators above .",
    "if this picture can be consolidated this would be a step beyond the present search for instanton structure by various cooling techniques @xcite .",
