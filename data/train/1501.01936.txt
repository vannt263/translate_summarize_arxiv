    "it must be therefore described by two parameters : a mean temperature @xmath19 and the mean strength of fluctuations , given by @xmath0 . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "this allows for further generalization to cases where one also has an energy transfer to / from heat bath .",
    "the scale @xmath20 in the tsallis distribution becomes then @xmath0-dependent : @xmath21 here the parameter @xmath22 depends on the type of energy transfer , cf .",

    "the second example is the _ preferential attachment approach _ ( used in stochastic networks @xcite ) . here",
    "the system under consideration exhibits correlations of the preferential attachment type ( like , for example , `` rich - get - richer '' phenomenon in networks ) and the scale parameter depends on the variable under consideration . if @xmath23 then the probability distribution function , @xmath24 , is given by an equation the solution of which is a tsallis distribution ( again , with @xmath17 ) : @xmath25^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}. \\label{eq : nets}\\ ] ] for @xmath26 one again gets the usual exponential distribution .",
