    "drinfeld doubles of hopf algebras @xcite are one of the most important objects in not only hopf algebra theory , but also in other areas including category theory and low - dimensional topology .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite - dimensional hopf algebra over a field @xmath3 , and @xmath9 be its drinfeld double .",
    "due to majid @xcite , it is known that there is a canonical representation of @xmath0 on @xmath1 , which is called the _",
    "schrdinger representation _ ( or the _ schrdinger module _ ) .",
    "this representation is an extension of the adjoint representation of @xmath1 , and originates from quantum mechanics as explained in majid s book ( * ? ? ?",
    "* examples 6.1.4 & 7.1.8 ) ( see section 2 for the precise definition of the schrdinger representation ) .",
    "the schrdinger module is also addressed by fang @xcite as an algebra in the yetter - drinfeld category @xmath10 via the miyashita - ulbrich action .    in this paper",
    ", we study the schrdinger module over the drinfeld double from the viewpoint of the theory of monoidal categories .",
    "we say that two finite - dimensional hopf algebras @xmath1 and @xmath2 over the same field @xmath3 are _ monoidally morita equivalent _ if @xmath7 and @xmath11 are equivalent as @xmath3-linear monoidal categories , where @xmath12 for an algebra @xmath13 is the category of @xmath13-modules .",
    "one of our main results is that the schrdinger module is an invariant under the monoidal morita equivalence in the following sense : if @xmath4 is an equivalence of @xmath3-linear monoidal categories , then the equivalence @xmath5 induced by @xmath6 preserves the schrdinger modules . to prove this result ,",
    "we introduce the notion of the _ schrdinger object _ for a monoidal category by using the monoidal center construction .",
    "it turns out that the schrdinger module over @xmath0 is characterized as the schrdinger object for @xmath7 .",
    "once such a characterization is established , the above result easily follows from general arguments .    as an application of the above category - theoretical understanding of the schrdinger module",
    ", we construct a new family of _ monoidal morita invariants _ , _ i.e. _ , invariants of finite - dimensional hopf algebras under the monoidal morita equivalence .",
    "some monoidal morita invariants have been discovered and studied ; see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "our family of invariants is parametrized by braids . roughly speaking ,",
    "the invariant associated with a braid @xmath8 is defined by coloring  the closure of @xmath8 by the schrdinger module . since the quantum dimension ( in the sense of majid @xcite ) of the schrdinger module is a special case of our invariants , we call the invariant associated with @xmath8 the _ braided dimension _ of the schrdinger module associated with @xmath8",
    ". we investigate what algebraic properties this family of invariants have and , in particular , show that the invariant associated to a certain braid closely relates to the number of irreducible representations .",
    "this paper organizes as follows : in section 2 , we recall the definition of the schrdinger module over the drinfeld double @xmath0 of a finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath1 . we also describe the definition of another schrdinger representation of @xmath0 on @xmath14 , which is introduced by fang @xcite .",
    "we refer the corresponding left @xmath0-module as the _ dual schrdinger module_. following @xcite we also describe the definition of radford s induction functors and its properties .",
    "it is shown that the schrdinger module and the dual schdinger module are isomorphic to the images of the trivial left @xmath1-module and the trivial right @xmath1-comodule under radford s induction functors , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we examine the relationship between the schrdinger module over @xmath15 and the dual schrdinger module over @xmath0 .    in section 3 ,",
    "we study the categorical aspects of the schrdinger module and the dual schrdinger module .",
    "we introduce a schrdinger object for a monoidal category @xmath16 as the object of @xmath17 representing the functor @xmath18 , where @xmath17 is the monoidal center of @xmath16 , @xmath19 is the forgetful functor , and @xmath20 is the unit object of @xmath16 . by using the properties of radford s induction functor ,",
    "we show that the schrdinger module over @xmath0 is a schrdinger object for @xmath21 under the identification @xmath22 .",
    "once this characterization is obtained , the invariance of the schrdinger module ( stated above ) is easily proved . a similar result for the dual schrdinger module",
    "is also proved .    in section 4 ,",
    "based on our category - theoretical understanding of the schrdinger module , we introduce a family of monoidal morita invariants parameterized by braids . we give formulas for the invariants associated with a certain series of braids , and give some applications .",
    "note that some monoidal morita invariants , such as ones introduced in @xcite and @xcite , factor through the drinfeld double construction .",
    "our invariants have an advantage that they do not factor through that .",
    "on the other hand , our invariants have a disadvantage in the non - semisimple situation : for any braid @xmath8 , the braided dimension of the schrdinger module of @xmath0 associated with @xmath8 is zero unless @xmath1 is cosemisimple . from this result",
    ", we could say that our invariants are not interesting as monoidal morita invariants for non - cosemisimple hopf algebras .",
    "however , endomorphisms on the schdinger module induced by braids are not generally zero , and thus may have some information about @xmath1 . to demonstrate , we give an example of a morphism induced by a braid , which turns out to be closely related to the unimodularlity of @xmath1 .    throughout this paper , @xmath3 is an arbitrary field , and all tensor products @xmath23 are taken over @xmath3 . for @xmath3-vector spaces @xmath24 and @xmath25 , denoted by @xmath26 is the @xmath3-linear isomorphism from @xmath27 to @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for a coalgebra @xmath32 and @xmath33",
