    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "sc ] , we introduce the self - complementary mixing , and give the structure of the majorana neutrino mass matrix dictated by the self - complementary mixing . the explicit model building is in section  [ sec : model ] , where the mass matrix structure is reproduced .",

    "we start with the self - complementarity relation of the first kind  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath10 where @xmath11 are lepton mixing angles in the standard parametrization . compared with the latest global fit result in table  [ tab : glb ] , we see that @xmath12 works marginally at the @xmath13 edge and @xmath14 is included in @xmath2 only in the normal ordering .",
    "nevertheless , there are several possibilities to account for the deviation from exact sc relation : the sc relation may hold at high energy scale ( e.g. a seesaw scale ) , so it receives corrections from renormalization group ( rg ) running effects ; it may receive corrections from high order operators ; it may hold only in the neutrino sector , and receive corrections from the charged lepton sector .",
