    "landauer s erasure principle ( lep ) is a fundamental result in the thermodynamics of computation .",
    "it gives a relation between the amount of the information stored by a memory device and the average entropy increase in the environment when a process erases that information .",
    "the principle holds for processes that satisfy two essential features :    * the process is carried out in the same way independent of the initial logical state ( i.e. , the information stored ) or the microstate of the device and * it restores the device to a known _ standard state _ at the end .",
    "the first feature is necessary for a complete erasure of information .",
    "although it is conceivable that the process can read the information and take different actions depending on it , this can be done only by recording the information somewhere else . in that case",
    ", the process must also erase the recorded information .",
    "even when this is the case , the statement ( a ) remains valid when the recording instrument is considered as part of the device .",
    "landauer has shown that under both of these conditions , heats must be dumped to the environment in such a way that the average increase of the entropy is at least @xmath0 per bit of the information erased,@xcite where @xmath1 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the original derivation of the principle by landauer also assumes that the logical states of the device are symmetric , i.e. , they have equal values for the thermodynamical quantities .",
    "however , such a restriction is not necessary when the total entropy change of both the device and the environment is considered .",
    "for example , for devices having non - symmetrical logical states , it is seen that the main conclusion of lep continues to be valid when a complete write - erase cycle is considered.@xcite    the principle is of prime importance in bennett s resolution of maxwell s demon paradox.@xcite in its quest to reduce entropy , the demon periodically makes measurements , records the results into its memory and takes some actions depending on these results .",
    "as the memory has a finite capacity , it must be cleared at some stage and reset to some standard state in order to repeat the same cycle of events .",
    "it is this erasure process and the associated entropy increase that exactly offsets the reduction of entropy the demon has achieved and thus saves the second law . independently from landauer and bennett , same conclusions have been obtained by penrose in his textbook on statistical mechanics.@xcite a review of landauer s principle and maxwell s demon , as well as reprints of some key articles can be found in ref . .",
    "since landauer s original derivation of lep relies on the second law where the definition of entropy is extended to an ensemble of memory devices , several objections have been raised on its validity .",
    "this prompted the appearance of alternative proofs of the principle that does not rely on the second law , by using the fokker - planck equation@xcite , by using the microstate distribution functions,@xcite and by analyzing the phase - space flow the erasing process induces.@xcite    in all of these , the feature ( a ) of the process is of central importance .",
    "since the device and the environment are subjected to the same treatment independent of the initial logical state , feature ( a ) is equivalent to the statement that the time - dependence of the microstates during the process is governed by a single , logical - state - independent hamiltonian . as a result ,",
    "the microstates before and after the process are related by a _",
    "single _ map .",
    "that map is a canonical transformation for classical systems , which preserves the phase - space volumes by liouville s theorem , and is an isometry for quantum systems , which preserves the dimensions of the subspaces it is acting to .",
    "lep follows from the constancy of the phase - space measures : as the process necessarily reduces the phase space of the device by requirement ( b ) , it must expand that of the environment which leads to the landauer bound .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate the full implications of the feature ( a ) in the most general setting , without any additional assumptions .",
    "it contains the derivation of a complete set of relations that captures _ all _ restrictions that can be placed on the heats dumped to the environment in such processes . when deriving these relations ,",
    "no further assumptions are made on the process and the logical states of the system .",
    "the logical states might be non - symmetrical and , in addition , the initial and final sets of these states might be different both in number and in character . also , the process applied can be nondeterministic , i.e. , for the same initial logical state , it might lead to a set of different final states with known transition probabilities . the precise statement that will be proved",
    "is the following , + * theorem 1 . * _ suppose that an arbitrary process having feature ( a ) is applied on a system that has @xmath2 initial logical states and brings it to a final configuration with @xmath3 logical states .",
    "if @xmath4 denotes the conditional probability that the initial logical state @xmath5 ends up in the final logical state @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denotes the total entropy increase of the system and the environment when an @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition occurs , then the following inequalities are satisfied @xmath8 i.e. , @xmath3 inequalities , one for each possible final state @xmath6 .",
    "_    no additional assumptions other than feature ( a ) will be made in proving this theorem .",
    "if the process obtains some information about the system and stores it into some recording instrument or , in general , an interaction occurs with an instrument , then the instrument should be considered as part of the system . apart from this ,",
    "if the initial logical state of the system is recorded elsewhere before the process begins , the conclusions of the theorem will not change as long as the process does not use this information .",
    "these relations imply lep as a special case ( when feature ( b ) is also imposed ) , but they go far beyond lep in implications because they can not be derived starting from this principle .",
    "it will also be shown that these relations are complete , i.e. , one can not find any further restrictions between the transition probabilities and individual entropy increases .",
    "consequently , any process with parameters satisfying ( [ eq : core ] ) can be constructed in principle .",
    "therefore , these inequalities provide a complete description of the thermodynamics of classical information processing by taking nondeterministic logical operations into account . like lep , these relations are mainly of theoretical interest , but they may find application in the investigation of heat exchange requirements of probabilistic turing machines .",
    "the heat exchanges for nondeterministic processes have previously been analyzed by penrose.@xcite they are also investigated in detail by maroney for the purpose of generalizing lep.@xcite however , as it is shown in this article , their entropic restrictions on heat exchanges are weaker than theorem 1 .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "rel ] : first , the notation used for describing the systems and the processes is defined .",
    "then , concentrating on the constant temperature case , the proof of theorem 1 is given for both classical and quantum systems .",
    "finally , the completeness of these relations is proved by constructing an arbitrary process on a simple system . in section [ sec : discussion ] , the connection between the relations ( [ eq : core ] ) and previously known relations such as lep is discussed .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains a brief conclusion .",
    "finally , appendix [ app : vary ] contains the proof of the theorem for the case of various baths at different temperatures .",
    "consider a system @xmath9 which can have two possibly identical configurations which will be called _ initial _ and _ final _ configurations . in the initial configuration ,",
    "the system has @xmath2 distinct logical states described by a hamiltonian @xmath10 and is in equilibrium with a heat bath @xmath11 at temperature @xmath12 . in the final configuration ,",
    "the system has @xmath3 distinct logical states described by hamiltonian @xmath13 and is in equilibrium with a bath @xmath14 at temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the two baths might be identical .",
    "the system can be microscopic , but all of the baths must be macroscopic .",
    "a process brings the system from the initial configuration to the final configuration , while in the meantime it brings the system into contact with various heat baths @xmath16 at different temperatures @xmath17 .",
    "any process satisfying the feature ( a ) can be described as a _ time - dependent hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the phase - space coordinates of the system @xmath9 and the bath @xmath16 respectively , @xmath21 is the hamiltonian of bath @xmath16 and @xmath22 describes the detailed coupling of the system to the baths . if the process starts at time @xmath23 and ends at @xmath24 , the total hamiltonian reduces to the corresponding expressions for each configuration . in other words , for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and for @xmath27 @xmath28 in both of these configurations",
    ", it will be assumed that the coupling terms @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are negligibly small .",
    "if @xmath31 is identically zero , then sufficiently long times should pass during the process for an effective equilibration .",
    "the phase space of the system is divided into disjoint regions corresponding to each logical state in such a way that any microstate @xmath19 belongs to one and only one logical state .",
    "this division can be described with indicator functions @xmath32 which are defined as @xmath33 when @xmath19 belongs to logical state @xmath5 in configuration @xmath34 and @xmath35 otherwise . as a result",
    ", @xmath36 must be satisfied for all @xmath19 .",
    "miscellaneous thermodynamical quantities for each logical state must be defined in the canonical ensemble by using only those microstates that belong to the given logical state .",
    "thus , using the indicator functions , the partition function and the internal energy are @xmath37 respectively and the free energy , @xmath38 , and entropy , @xmath39 , are defined accordingly .",
    "the logical states must be sufficiently stable in such a way that they can be used for information storage purposes , i.e. , once the system is in one of the logical states , either it does not make a transition into another logical state , or the transition time scales are long compared to the process and equilibration time scales . in the former case ,",
    "impenetrable barriers separate the microstates of different logical states and the above quantities correspond to the exact canonical thermodynamical functions . in the latter case ,",
    "high thermal or diffusion barriers with long transition times separate the logical states and there is some arbitrariness in the choice of the indicator functions .",
    "once this choice is made however , the thermodynamical functions must be defined as above .    in the proof ,",
    "the canonical map between the microstates of the composite system of @xmath9 and the baths for two given times @xmath40 and @xmath41 will be investigated ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "it will be supposed that the system is prepared such that , at time @xmath40 it is in logical state @xmath5 of the initial configuration and in equilibrium with the bath @xmath11 .",
    "the initial distribution of the microstates of the composite system depends on the preparation , but it must be consistent with the equilibrium assumption . consider the microstate of the composite system at time @xmath41 after the process is applied .",
    "let @xmath4 be the probability that the final microstate belongs to logical state @xmath6 of final configuration .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the _ average _ work done given that an @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition occurs .",
    "this is the conditional average of the total energy change of the system and the baths over all microstates that take part in @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition .",
    "similarly let @xmath44 denote the _ average _ amount of heat transferred to the bath @xmath16 given that @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition occurs . as these quantities must be computed in equilibrium , @xmath45 must be sufficiently large for getting thermal equilibrium at time @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , @xmath46 must be sufficiently large for thermal equilibration .",
    "provided that both of these conditions are satisfied , the conditional averages of the initial and final energies of the system over microstates that take part in @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the quantities above are related by the first law , @xmath49 the total entropy change per @xmath1 in @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition will be denoted by @xmath50 and is given by @xmath51 in order to interpret these quantities as the total entropy change , the baths must be sufficiently large so that the heats dumped @xmath44 can not change their temperature .    before going further ,",
    "it is worth to consider an important special case , the constant - temperature case , where the system is in contact with a single bath at temperature @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) . in that case",
    ", the quantities @xmath50 can be given a simple meaning in terms of the heat emitted to the bath or the work done on the system .",
    "these quantities can be expressed in terms of @xmath50 as @xmath55 note that , when some other thermodynamically reversible deterministic process brings the system from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , @xmath56 is the exact amount of heat that must be dumped to the bath .",
    "for the current nondeterministic process however , the heat dumped exceeds that reversible contribution by @xmath57 .",
    "for this particular reason , for the constant temperature case , it is tempting to call @xmath50 as the dimensionless _ excess heat _ ( in units of @xmath58 ) associated with this particular transition . for the same reason",
    ", it can also be called as the dimensionless excess work . despite what the name may imply",
    ", the excess heats can be negative for nondeterministic transitions .",
    "the excess heats are convenient quantities to be concentrated on , because in a cyclic change where a set of processes bring the system back to the initial configuration and state , all reversible contributions in ( [ eq : heatemitted ] ) add up to zero .",
    "the sum of excess heats then gives the total heat dumped to the bath .",
    "this is the case in the context of maxwell s demon , for example . in this way",
    ", the inconvenience brought by the asymmetry of the states is eliminated .",
    "this subsection contains the proof of theorem 1 for a classical system . to make the derivation as clear as possible",
    ", it is assumed that the system interacts with a single bath @xmath59 at temperature @xmath52 .",
    "the proof of the general case , which involves various baths at different temperatures , is not different from the proof given below , but the notation is more involved . for this reason , the sketch of the general proof is given in the appendix .",
    "the proof relies on the following approximations which are justified by the largeness of the bath .",
    "( 1 ) at the initial preparation stage , the total energy @xmath60 of the composite system @xmath61 has an arbitrary distribution in a certain range of energies , say between @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for any @xmath60 in this interval ,",
    "the associated microcanonical temperature of composite system is approximately @xmath52 .",
    "( 2 ) the width of the range , @xmath64 , is much larger than the typical energies for the system .",
    "( 3 ) given that the initial energy of @xmath61 at time @xmath40 is @xmath60 , the process parameters @xmath4 , @xmath43 and @xmath65 of the process is approximately independent of @xmath60 for @xmath66 .",
    "the errors made from these approximations will get smaller as the size of the bath increases .",
    "the last assumption enables us to investigate the relationship between these quantities within the microcanonical ensemble formalism . in other words",
    ", it is supposed that the initial states of the composite system has total energy @xmath60 within the aforementioned range , and the microstates are distributed with equal _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "the basic method is to express the transition probabilities in terms of certain disjoint phase - space volumes .",
    "a particular addition of these volumes leads directly to the inequalities of theorem 1 .",
    "the process induces a canonical transformation @xmath67 on the total phase space of @xmath61 from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath67 map the initial points @xmath68 to the final points @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath67 is canonical , it preserves volumes by liouville s theorem , i.e. , the phase - space volume elements are equal , @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath71 represent the phase - space volume of the bath consisting of points having energy between @xmath60 and @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding density is @xmath73 as a result of the assumptions made above , the relation @xmath74 holds with good accuracy for typical energies @xmath75 of the system .",
    "let @xmath76 represent the volume of the total phase space of @xmath61 of those microstates having energy between @xmath60 and @xmath72 and belonging to state-@xmath5 of system @xmath9 in configuration @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding density is @xmath77 in here , the interaction terms representing bath - system coupling are dropped assuming that they are negligible .",
    "finally , let @xmath78 be the volume of phase - space points of @xmath61 that start at state-@xmath5 with energy between @xmath60 and @xmath72 and end up at state-@xmath6 with energy between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the corresponding density can be expressed as @xmath81 note that @xmath82 represents the density of points where an @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition has occurred and the total energy has increased by @xmath83 . in that case",
    ", @xmath83 is the total work done .    now , suppose that the total energy of @xmath61 was @xmath60 and the system was in state @xmath5 before the process is applied .",
    "then , by equal _ a priori _ probabilities assumption , @xmath61 is in one of the microstates consistent with these restrictions with equal probability . in that case , the probability that a transition to state @xmath6 occurs with final energy between @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be expressed as @xmath84 let @xmath85 be the probability of making an @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition , irrespective of the work done , and let @xmath86 be the probability distribution function for the work done @xmath87 in the @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition .",
    "these probabilities can be expressed as @xmath88 as discussed above , both of these probabilities have only a weak dependence on @xmath60 , which can be considered to be a dependence on the temperature @xmath52 .",
    "for this reason , we will write @xmath89 and @xmath90 ; the dependence on the temperature is assumed , but not shown explicitly . combining these with ( [ eq : classical_sys_dos ] ) we get @xmath91 this equation relates the phase - space volume densities to the process dependent quantities : the transition probabilities and the distribution function for the work done in individual transitions .    to obtain the inequalities of the theorem ,",
    "we sum ( [ eq : def_m ] ) over the initial logical states and integrate over @xmath60 which gives @xmath92 where the equality of the volume elements , @xmath70 , is used and the prime on the integral sign indicates that the integration is over all possible final microstates .",
    "this integral is not over the whole of the phase space when the process map @xmath67 is not onto .",
    "this may happen when infinite , impenetrable barriers evacuate some part of the phase space .",
    "for example , this is the case for the erasure process considered by landauer where all final logical states other than the standard state are inaccessible .",
    "for this reason , the right hand side of ( [ eq : mintegral ] ) is smaller than the integral over the whole of phase space , @xmath93 this is the first place where an inequality is introduced .",
    "the equality holds if and only if @xmath67 is onto .",
    "using ( [ eq : expr4 m ] ) and changing the integration variable to @xmath94 gives @xmath95 where @xmath96 represents the conditional average over microstates that take part in @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition .",
    "using the strict convexity of the exponential function we get @xmath97 where equality holds if and only if work done has no fluctuations . finally , using @xmath98 and the relation ( [ eq : workdone_excessheat ] ) , we get the desired inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : core]).@xmath99    inequalities are introduced at two points ; therefore if a process has equalities for all of these @xmath3 relations , the process map @xmath67 on the total phase space should be onto and works done should have absolutely no fluctuations .",
    "we will define @xmath100 , the _ inefficiency _ of the process for the final state @xmath6 , as @xmath101 the relations ( [ eq : core ] ) then imply that all inefficiencies are non - negative .",
    "inefficiencies are essentially a combined measure of the irreversibility of the process and the fluctuations in the energy exchanges .",
    "as it will be seen below , by process engineering , some excess heats can be reduced and all inefficiencies can be made to vanish . in the case of an efficient process , where all @xmath102 , it is not possible to decrease any of the excess heats without increasing some other excess heat corresponding to a transition with the same final state . by the discussion above , efficient processes have no fluctuation for the excess heats and the process map is onto .    it might be interesting to view the derivation above from the perspective of the time - reversed process .",
    "the time reversal of a process is always well defined in the hamiltonian description ; it is simply given by the hamiltonian @xmath103 and brings the system from the final configuration to the initial one .",
    "basically , one needs to carry out the same actions in reverse order .",
    "below , the associated quantities for the reverse process will be indicated by tildes . for simplicity , consider the case where @xmath67 is onto . as",
    "the reversed process map is @xmath104 , the densities in ( [ eq : def_m ] ) are related by @xmath105 . invoking ( [ eq : expr4 m ] )",
    ", the following relation between the probability distributions can be found @xmath106    that relation can be made simpler by expressing it in terms of a microstate dependent variable for the excess heat , @xmath107 .",
    "note that @xmath108 and @xmath109 has no fluctuations if and only if @xmath87 has no fluctuations .",
    "this variable can also be expressed as a function of the microstate coordinates as @xmath110 for the forward process .",
    "therefore , for the reversed process with initial point at @xmath111 , the value of the corresponding variable is @xmath112 .",
    "the relationship between the probability distributions of @xmath109 for forward and reverse processes then becomes @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the distribution function for that quantity . the inequalities ( [ eq : core ] )",
    "are obtained by using the fact that the total probability for the reversed process is 1 .      for quantum systems , there is a problem involved in the definition ( [ eq : def_s ] ) of @xmath50 . to provide a consistent definition of these quantities",
    ", it should be assumed that the system starts from a definite initial logical state @xmath5 and when the process is completed a projective measurement of the final logical state is carried out .",
    "provided that this is done , the average heats dumped to the baths can be computed from the expectation value of the respective hamiltonians of the baths and therefore @xmath50 are well - defined quantities .",
    "it is important that such a final measurement stage takes place to eliminate the possibility of having final microstates in a superposition state of various logical states .",
    "if this is the case , the inequalities of theorem 1 are valid .",
    "the proof for this case is not different from the classical proof given above .",
    "there is only a change in the terms used . instead of a canonical map",
    ", there is now an isometry @xmath115 that maps the initial microstates into the final ones , which preserve the dimensions of the subspaces ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "as above , the map @xmath115 does not need to be onto , i.e. , it does not need to be unitary . in that case",
    ", @xmath117 is a projection operator on the accessible final states and therefore @xmath118 .",
    "the operators @xmath32 are now a complete set of orthogonal projections ( @xmath119 ) which commute with the respective hamiltonians @xmath120 .",
    "all of the phase - space densities defined above can now be expressed as @xmath121 the identity in eq .",

    "the total work done when this is the case is @xmath156 therefore , the excess heat of that transition is @xmath50.@xmath99    note that when all expansion and compression steps are done infinitely slowly there will be no fluctuations in the excess heats .",
    "this implies that the process map @xmath67 is not onto if some inefficiencies are non - zero .",
    "it is obvious that the step 6 is responsible for this effect as it caused the evacuation of some part of the total phase - space .",
    "there is a stronger form of this theorem concerned with the general case where the system interacts with different heat baths at different temperatures .",
    "it states that the inequalities ( [ eq : core ] ) capture also all restrictions that are satisfied by individual heats dumped to the baths .",
    "in other words , if each @xmath44 are chosen such that the quantity @xmath50 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_s ] ) satisfies ( [ eq : core ] ) , then it is possible to construct a process where the average heats dumped into each bath in each possible transition are given by the chosen quantities .",
    "the proof of this statement is not complicated ; one only needs to change the step 3 of the process described above in an appropriate way . for this reason ,",
    "the construction of the process and the proof of this stronger statement are left to the reader .",
    "since the inequalities in ( [ eq : core ] ) express all restrictions that can be placed on the excess heats , they contain other powerful relations . in this section",
    ", it will be shown that a number of relations that have been obtained by different researchers in different contexts can be derived from these inequalities .",
    "the simplicity of these derivations is an indication of the power of these inequalities",
    ". a few other implications of these relations are also discussed at the end .      as each term in ( [ eq : core ] ) has to be less than 1 , the following lower bound for the excess heats in terms of the corresponding transition probabilities",
    "can be given @xmath157 hence , some excess heats can be negative if the corresponding transition probabilities are less than one .",
    "this inequality has been first obtained by penrose in his treatment of nondeterministic processes.@xcite inequalities in ( [ eq : core ] ) enable us to see how the lower bound above can be accomplished .",
    "if , @xmath5 is the only initial state that leads to the final state @xmath6 , then this lower bound can be achieved .",
    "if possible initial states are more than one , then it is not possible to achieve the lower bound , but it is possible to approach arbitrarily close to it , at the expense of increasing @xmath158 for all @xmath159 .",
    "a bound on the fluctuations of the excess heats can also be obtained if they are gaussian . in that case , the average of @xmath160 for an @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition is @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the standard deviation of the fluctuations .",
    "the upper bound on the standard deviation can then be obtained from ( [ eq : reverse_forward ] ) as @xmath163 in other words , the fluctuations are necessarily suppressed if the lower bound in ( [ eq : penrose_lowbound ] ) is approached . however ,",
    "if the fluctuations are not gaussian , it is not possible to find such bounds on the standard deviation .",
    "consider a landauer erasure process where all initial states end up in the same final state , e.g. , in state @xmath164 ( i.e. , a restore - to-1 process ) .",
    "in this case , @xmath165 , all inefficiencies except @xmath166 are infinite and for the final state @xmath167 we have @xmath168 this relation has been first obtained by szilard@xcite in connection with his membrane model . although szilard associated changes in entropy with the measurement process , a correct interpretation would connect it to the erasure as discussed in ref .  .",
    "in order to obtain a lower bound on average excess heats , it is convenient to introduce the legendre transform of the information - theoretic entropy function , @xmath169 , of a probability distribution @xmath170",
    ". let @xmath171 be an @xmath2-tuplet of real numbers .",
    "the legendre transform of @xmath172 is @xmath173 where the minimum is taken over all possible probability distributions .",
    "the definition above implies that the inequality @xmath174 is satisfied for all @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , the inequality becomes an equality if and only if @xmath177 .",
    "taking @xmath178 in ( [ eq : j_sigma_ineq ] ) gives @xmath179 and @xmath180 if the system is a memory device and information is coded such that the state @xmath5 appears with probability @xmath181 , then @xmath182 is the measure of information in nats stored by the device .",
    "if the same resetting process is applied on the device ( or on an ensemble of such devices ) irrespective of the state , then the left - hand side of ( [ eq : averasure ] ) is the ( ensemble ) average of the excess heats .",
    "therefore , this inequality states lep .",
    "note that the inequality holds for any probability distribution @xmath175 . as a result",
    ", it can be considered as an infinite set of mathematical relations between @xmath183 .",
    "interpreted in this way , ( [ eq : averasure ] ) is equivalent to ( [ eq : exp_lep ] ) .",
    "the derivation above can be repeated for an arbitrary process as well , which leads to the generalized form of landauer s principle .",

    "although they have clear physical interpretations , these inequalities are weaker than and not equivalent to the main inequalities of this article given in ( [ eq : core ] ) .",
    "the reason is that , all expressions in ( [ eq : glep ] ) is essentially a combination of @xmath195 , the final - state average of the excess heat when the initial state is @xmath5 .",
    "for this reason , ( [ eq : glep ] ) places restrictions only on the averages @xmath196 and not on the individual excess heats associated with every transition .    moreover ,",
    "( [ eq : core ] ) and ( [ eq : glep ] ) imply an opposite dependence between individual excess heats of transitions . as an example , consider a process where all inefficiencies are 0 , and one of the excess heats , say @xmath50 , is desired to be decreased .",
    "relations ( [ eq : glep ] ) alone implies that , this can be achieved by increasing another excess heat with the _ same initial state _ ( e.g. , @xmath197 with @xmath198 ) in such a way that @xmath196 remains the same .",
    "however , according to ( [ eq : core ] ) , this is not possible ; @xmath50 can be decreased only by increasing another excess heat with the _ same final state _",
    "( e.g. , @xmath158 with @xmath159 ) . for this reason ,",
    "the relations ( [ eq : glep ] ) are not sufficient for this kind of process engineering problems .",
    "a trivial application of the inequalities in ( [ eq : core ] ) is to controlled processes . here , the process to be applied on a system @xmath9 is determined based on the logical state of another system @xmath199 , the controller ; but the controller does not change its logical state during the process . the controlled - not gate is a well - known example .",
    "the restrictions on the heat exchanges with the environment for such processes can be analyzed simply by imposing these restrictions for each individual process on @xmath9 . to be precise ,",
    "suppose that when the state of the controller is @xmath200 , the process @xmath201 is applied on @xmath9 which has transition probabilities @xmath202 and excess heats @xmath203 . for this case , the controlled process applied on the combined system @xmath204 has the following transition probabilities and excess heats @xmath205 the inequalities ( [ eq : core ] ) for the controlled process then are @xmath206 which must hold for all @xmath6 and @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , the controlled process satisfies the inequalities ( [ eq : core ] ) if and only if every individual process @xmath201 applied on @xmath9 satisfies the same inequalities .",
    "an immediate application of the result above is to the measurement processes . in this case",
    "@xmath199 is the system whose state will be measured and @xmath9 plays the role of the recording instrument . before the measurement , @xmath9 must be prepared in a standard state , say @xmath207 .",
    "the measurement is then a controlled process as above , where the individual process @xmath201 changes the state of @xmath9 from @xmath207 to @xmath208 with certainty . as this is the only necessary requirement , it is possible to construct @xmath201 as a deterministic and logically reversible process and choose @xmath209 .",
    "this controlled process changes the logical states of @xmath204 from @xmath210 into @xmath211 , i.e. , the state of @xmath199 has been copied into @xmath9 , and no excess heat is transferred to the environment in doing this .",
    "this is a simple , but general demonstration of the principle first stated by bennett@xcite , i.e. , thermodynamically reversible measurements can be done provided that the recording instrument is initialized in a standard state .",
    "the inequalities in ( [ eq : core ] ) give the relation between excess heats of the same final state , e.g. , it gives a restriction between @xmath212 .",
    "the following lower bound on the largest of these quantities can be easily deduced @xmath213 where the equality applies if and only if @xmath214 .",
    "from here , it is possible to show that the largest excess heat of all transitions , @xmath215 , is bounded from below by @xmath216 . in other words",

    "first , consider a fixed @xmath5 .",
    "strict convexity of the exponential function leads to @xmath223 where the rightmost inequality is an equality if and only @xmath224 for all @xmath6 .",
    "next , sum these inequalities over the initial state @xmath5 and apply ( [ eq : core ] ) to get @xmath225 as the leftmost and rightmost sides of this chain are equal , all of the individual terms are equal to each other .",
    "therefore , all inequalities that are used to obtain it must have been equalities as well . as a result ,",
    "@xmath226 for all @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath102 for all @xmath6 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_double_stoch ] ) follows from these.@xmath99    at this point , it is worth to concentrate on a particular special case , the case where the initial and final configurations of the system are identical ( and hence @xmath227 ) .",
    "most applications , for example memory elements used in computation , fall under the scope of this case .",
    "a minor result that follows from the proposition for this case is that for any process there should be a transition with a non - negative excess heat .",
    "similarly , there should be a state @xmath5 for which @xmath228 .",
    "the processes that satisfy the conditions of the proposition have some remarkable properties that should be mentioned .",
    "these are processes that have doubly stochastic transition probabilities @xmath229 in this case , it is possible to construct the process in such a way that all excess heats are zero which necessarily implies that the process is also efficient for all final states .",
    "the proposition is stating that any process that has non - positive excess heats for all transitions should be such a process .",
    "the excess heats of these processes have absolutely no fluctuations .",
    "there are no macroscopic fluctuations because all excess heats are uniform , @xmath230 , and there are no microscopic fluctuations because the process is efficient .",
    "if the logical states of the system are also symmetric , i.e. , they have equal equilibrium energy and entropy , then absolutely no heat exchange occurs with the bath and there is no work done irrespective of the initial and final state .",
    "a contact with a bath is not even necessary to implement the process .",
    "moreover , successive application of two such processes yields a process that has the same feature . for this reason",
    ", they might find application in the implementation of probabilistic turing machines .",
    "if the individual computation steps of such a machine have doubly stochastic transition probabilities , then it is possible to run the whole computation without any heat exchange with the environment and without any work done ( assuming that the states are symmetric ) .",
    "furthermore , any probabilistic turing machine can be adapted to have doubly stochastic transitions .",
    "consider , for example , a step of the computation where a set of memory elements @xmath9 with @xmath2 logical states undergoes a logical operation with transition probabilities @xmath4 , which may not be doubly stochastic .",
    "let @xmath231 be an ancillary device having @xmath2 logical states , which is initially in state @xmath232 .",
    "consider an operation on @xmath233 which has the following transition probabilities @xmath234 where @xmath235 and the roman letters denote the logical states of @xmath231 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath236 is doubly stochastic and @xmath237 . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath231 starts in state @xmath167 , then same logical operation is obtained on @xmath9 . in order to make the whole computation doubly stochastic ,",
    "different ancillaries with the same initial state have to be used at each computation step .",
    "this discussion essentially shows that probabilistic turing machines with doubly stochastic transition probabilities can have the same computing power as any other probabilistic machine , at the expense of using a larger memory space .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that probabilistic turing machines can also be designed to have deterministic computation steps where randomness is introduced by an additional input tape containing random symbols .",
    "they are more manageable for thermodynamically reversible computation since they can be adapted to have logically reversible computation steps as in ref . .",
    "in that case , they will also be able to erase all intermediate results of the computation , except the input , the desired output and the random tape , without any heat exchange .",
    "in addition , the symbols on the random tape can also be generated and subsequently erased without any heat exchange ( e.g. , inserting walls into a container containing single molecule for generation ; removing the walls for erasing ) . as a result",
    ", there is no problem in doing probabilistic computation in a thermodynamically reversible way .",
    "a complete set of inequalities has been obtained that places restrictions on the excess heats and the transition probabilities of any nondeterministic processes having feature ( a ) .",
    "these inequalities can be interpreted as a generalized form of both penrose s bound ( [ eq : penrose_lowbound ] ) for nondeterministic processes and landauer s bound ( [ eq : exp_lep ] ) for resetting operations .",
    "their unique power comes from the completeness property . as a result , just like these two classical results , any relation between excess heats and transition probabilities can be obtained starting from these inequalities .",
    "consider the general case where the process brings the system into contact with various heat baths at different temperatures .",
    "the notation is described in subsection [ subsec : notation ] and the proof follows the same lines of the one given in subsection [ subsec : classical_proof ] .",
    "the quantum case is assumed because of its slightly better notation .",
    "it is also assumed that the baths @xmath11 and @xmath14 are distinct ; the case where they are identical is not considered separately as the proof is altered only slightly .",
