    "<S> we prove several topological properties of linear weingarten surfaces of bryant type , as wave fronts in hyperbolic @xmath0-space . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we show the orientability of such surfaces , and also co - orientability when they are not flat . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show an explicit formula of the non - holomorphic hyperbolic gauss map via another hyperbolic gauss map which is holomorphic . using this </S>",
    "<S> , we show the orientability and co - orientability of cmc-1 faces ( i.e. , constant mean curvature one surfaces with admissible singular points ) in de sitter 3-space . </S>",
    "<S> ( cmc-1 faces might not be wave fronts in general , but belong to a class of linear weingarten surfaces with singular points . ) since both linear weingarten fronts and cmc-1 faces may have singular points , orientability and co - orientability are both nontrivial properties . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the zig - zag representation of the fundamental group of a linear weingarten surface of bryant type is trivial </S>",
    "<S> . we also remark on some properties of non - orientable maximal surfaces in lorentz - minkowski 3-space , comparing the corresponding properties of cmc-1 faces in de sitter 3-space . </S>"
