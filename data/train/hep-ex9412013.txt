    "charmonium production is currently the best way to study @xmath4 quark production at cdf at the lowest possible transverse momentum of the @xmath4 . while the signature and signal - to - noise for the are excellent , the actual conclusions regarding @xmath4 production are strongly dependent on the fraction of the data sample due to @xmath4 decays .",
    "one obvious way of determining this fraction is to use the decay distance of the  state .",
    "in contrast , the fraction of s from @xmath4 decays is thought to be close to one@xcite .",
    "thus , in determining the spectrum of @xmath4 quarks from a study of  events , one does not have to worry about the fraction of  production due to @xmath3 decays .",
    "in the course of this analysis , however , a very large zero - lifetime component for the observed  signal has been seen .",
    "therefore , one still has to make use of the lifetime information .",
    "the cdf detector has been described in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we describe here briefly the components relevant to this analysis .",
    "the cdf coordinate system defines the beam line to be the @xmath5 direction .",

    "the ctc contains 84 layers , which are grouped into nine superlayers , with 5 superlayers providing axial information and 4 providing stereo .",
    "it covers a pseudorapidity range of @xmath8 .",
    "the silicon vertex detector ( svx ) is a silicon microvertex detector .",
    "it consists of four layers 2.9 to 7.9  from the beam line and provides high resolution tracking information in the  plane .",
    "when combined with a ctc track , it provides an impact parameter resolution of @xmath9 and a transverse momentum resolution of @xmath10 .",
    "primary vertices have a gaussian distribution with a width of about 27 , while the svx only reaches to @xmath11 , so only about 60% of the ctc tracks can be augmented with svx information .    outside the ctc",
    "are electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , which provide five absorption lengths of material before the central muon chambers ( cmu ) .",
    "the cmu consists of four layers of limited streamer chambers .",

    "a fast hardware tracker must find at least one track that points to the correct muon chamber .",
    "for the third level , the full ctc track reconstruction is done .",
    "both tracks must be found , and extrapolate to within @xmath14 of the muon chamber tracks in @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",

    "the @xmath23 of this fit is required to be less than 10 , with one degree of freedom .",
