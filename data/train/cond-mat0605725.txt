    "the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation  @xcite is a nonlinear differential equation with noise representing in the simplest way the roughening phenomena of growing surfaces .",

    "the kpz equation offers a theoretical framework to understand such a kinetic roughening , and many real - world nonequilibrium interfaces as well as computational models belong to the kpz class or its variants  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable universal quantity for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional growing surfaces is the large deviation function ( ldf ) @xcite .",
    "it concerns the tail behavior of the probability distribution of the spatially - averaged height , @xmath4 with @xmath2 the system size and @xmath5 the height at a position @xmath6 . in the stationary state",
    ", it has been claimed to be universal within the kpz class .",
    "the exact ldf  @xcite derived for the single - step ( ss ) model  @xcite has the cumulants ratio @xmath7 , which has been reproduced for other computational models with no significant deviations  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation of the average height from configuration to configuration does not saturate but all of its cumulants grow with time even in the stationary state and the ldf has asymmetric tails .",
    "the ldf of the average height in the stationary state is of interest also in the theory of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "it has been shown that the probability distribution of the phase space contraction ( or entropy production ) rate has a non - trivial symmetry property in dissipative chaotic systems and this has been considered as a generalized fluctuation theorem for nonequilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "recent studies  @xcite show that the theorem is applicable also for stochastic dynamics of interacting particles with the symmetry property found in the ldf of the particle current , which corresponds to the total height increase , @xmath8 , in the language of the growing surfaces .",
    "the ldf of an averaged quantity contains a lot of information specific for a given system .",
    "for example , one can obtain the dynamic correlations among individual variables , which are not revealed by the gaussian behavior around the mean value .",
    "previous works , however , have been restricted to stationary states , where , in mathematical terms , only the ground state of the time - evolution operator survives and thus its ldf could be derived analytically . in this work ,",
    "we explore the ldf of the average height in the early - time regime of the kpz surface . by the early - time regime , we mean @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the dynamic exponent . in the early - time regime",
    ", a flat surface evolves into its stationary state which is rough .",
    "the ldf of the average height corresponds to the legendre transformation of the logarithm of the characteristic function , as the entropy to the free energy .",
    "we derive the characteristic function in the early - time regime of the ss model from its stationary - state counterpart that is exactly known  @xcite . to do so",
    ", we use the assumption that the scaling property and the model - parameter dependence of the latter are the same as those of the locally - stationary segments in the early - time regime , the size of each of which scales with time as @xmath13 . combined with this result ,",
    "the scaling analysis of the kpz equation enables us to see how the characteristic function depends on the parameters of the kpz equation .",
    "we derive the ldf and the dynamic scaling behavior of the cumulants from this characteristic function , and their universal parts are identified in the numerical results from two different models in the kpz class .",

    "we first review known results about the ldf derived from the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "the ss model  @xcite is a discrete growth model belonging to the kpz class , where the height @xmath5 for @xmath23 can take even ( odd ) integer numbers for @xmath6 even ( odd ) and satisfy the ss condition , @xmath24 , for all @xmath6 with @xmath25 .",
    "the height at a randomly chosen site is increased by @xmath26 with probability @xmath27 or decreased by @xmath26 with probability @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , provided the new height does not violate the ss condition , and the time @xmath1 increases by @xmath30 after @xmath2 such attempts .",
    "this model is equivalent to the partially asymmetric exclusion process .",
    "hence the time - evolution operator for the height step configuration @xmath31 with @xmath32 is identical to the asymmetric xxz spin chain hamiltonian which in turn is diagonalized by the bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy of a parameterized version of the hamiltonian then determines the characteristic function of the total height increase , @xmath33 , for @xmath34 .",
