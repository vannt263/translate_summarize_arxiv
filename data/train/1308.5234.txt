    "the population of @xmath1-ray binaries is a subclass of the high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) population ; they are binary systems comprised of a high mass ( @xmath10 m@xmath11 ) star and a compact object whose spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaks above 1 mev .",
    "indeed , they exhibit emission at high energies ( he ; 0.1100 gev ) and/or very high - energies ( vhe ; @xmath0100 gev ) .",
    "the non - thermal high energy radiation from these objects indicates that they are sites of natural particle acceleration . at present only a handful of confirmed @xmath1-ray binaries are known :    * ls  i  + 61@xmath2303  @xcite * ls5039  @xcite * psr b1259@xmath1263 * hess j0632 + 057   @xcite * 1fgl j1018.6@xmath125856 @xcite    cyg x@xmath123 @xcite and cyg x@xmath121 @xcite show @xmath1-ray flaring activity , but their seds are peaked in x - rays .",

    "hess j0632 + 057  was the first @xmath1-ray binary to be discovered at vhe prior to its detection in other wavebands ; the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration reported an unidentified point - like vhe source lying close to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "it was noted that a potential optical counterpart to the source was a massive emission - line star , mwc 148 , of spectral type b0pe .",
    "these facts led to the hypothesis that the source may be a new @xmath1-ray binary , a nature that was confirmed by the discovery of an orbital period of @xmath13 days detected in the x - ray counterpart by @xcite using data from a long - term _ swift_-xrt monitoring campaign .",
    "@xcite determined the ephemeris and the orbital parameters of the system using the x - ray orbital period and through optical spectroscopy of mwc 148 .",
    "they found the binary to be in a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath14 ) .    following",

    "@xcite detected a point - like , variable radio source at the position of mcw 148 with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and the very large array ( vla ) at 1.28 and 5ghz , respectively .",
    "@xcite observed hess j0632 + 057  with the european vlbi network ( evn ) at 1.6ghz in two epochs : during the 2011 january / february x - ray outburst and 30 days later .",
    "in the first epoch the source appears point - like , whereas in the second it appears extended with a projected size of @xmath375au assuming a distance to the system of 1.5kpc .",
    "the brightness temperature of 2@xmath1710@xmath18k at 1.6ghz together with the average spectral index of @xmath3 is indicative of non - thermal synchrotron radiation producing the radio emission @xcite .",

    "we describe the procedures implemented to analyse this complex field and the results of searching for persistent , orbitally variable and transient high - energy emission from hess j0632 + 057 . a search for radio pulsations using the 100-m green bank telescope ( gbt ) is also reported .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) is the primary instrument onboard _ fermi _ ; it is a pair conversion telescope sensitive to photons with energies from @xmath320mev to more than 300gev .",
    "the direction of an incident photon is derived by tracking the electron - positron pair in a high - resolution converter tracker , and the energy of the pair is measured with a hodoscopic csi(tl ) crystal calorimeter .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat has a peak on - axis effective area of 8000 @xmath20 , a 2.4sr field of view , and an angular resolution of @xmath30.6@xmath2 at 1gev ( for events converting in the front section of the tracker ) .",
    "furthermore , an anti - coincidence detector vetoes the background of charged particles @xcite .",
    "the observatory operates principally in survey mode ; the telescope is rocked north and south on alternate orbits to provide more uniform coverage so that every part of the sky is observed for @xmath330 minutes every 3 hours .",
    "the analysis presented here makes use of all data taken from 2008 august 4 until 2012 march 3 .",
    "the _ fermi _  science tools v09r28p00 package was used to analyse the ` source ' event class data .",
    "all events within a circular region of interest ( roi ) of 15@xmath2 radius centred on the known location of the massive star mwc 148 associated with hess j0632 + 057 ( r.a.(j2000 ) = 98247 , dec(j2000 ) = 5800 ) and in the energy range 0.1100 gev were extracted .",
    "the good time intervals are defined such that the roi does not cross the @xmath1-ray - bright earth limb ( defined at 100@xmath2 from the zenith angle ) , and that the source is always inside the lat field of view , namely within a cone angle of 66@xmath2 .",
    "the ` p7source_v6 ' instrument response functions ( irfs ) are used throughout the analysis .",
    "when constructing spectral - spatial models of the roi the models used for the galactic diffuse emission ( gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits ) and isotropic backgrounds ( iso_p7v6source.txt ) were those currently recommended by the lat team and were used by the _",

    "hess j0632 + 057  lies at the galactic latitude @xmath21 , in the active region of the monoceros loop .",
    "an image of this region in the @xmath1-ray band is shown in figure [ cmap ] .",
    "this is a background subtracted count map of the @xmath22 region around hess j0632 + 057 .",
    "it is generated by selecting events with energies greater than 1 gev , and subtracting the counts due to the galactic diffuse emission and the isotropic emission as calculated using the respective models with the science tool gtmodel . in figure [ cmap ]",

    "it has a flux ( @xmath0100 mev ) of @xmath23 ph @xmath6 s@xmath7 , and the pulse profile has the characteristic two narrow peaks separated by @xmath24 in phase @xcite .",
    "the pulse profile obtained with the dataset analysed in this paper is shown in figure [ psrj0633 ] . to coherently assign a phase to each photon over such a long observation period ( @xmath25 years )",
    "requires an up - to - date ephemeris for the pulsar . as psr j0633 + 0632 is radio - quiet , the new ephemeris has been calculated using the _ fermi_-lat data with the method described by @xcite .",
    "a phase was associated to each event using the _ fermi _ plug - in of the tempo2 software package @xcite .",
    "a weight was also assigned to each event , corresponding to the probability that the gamma ray is emitted by the pulsar , rather than by a nearby source or by the diffuse emission @xcite ; weights are calculated using the science tool gtsrcprob .",
    "the spectral models of the pulsar and the nearby sources adopted to calculate the weights are those from the 2fgl catalogue . finally , the pulse profile in figure [ psrj0633 ] was obtained by summing the weights in each phase bin for the events within 2  of the pulsar position .    to minimise contamination from the strong emission of psr j0633 + 0632 in the analysis of hess j0632 + 057   the pulsar emission was ` gated ' by only using events which occurred outside the pulse peaks , during phases 0.660.98 and 0.210.49 ( hereafter out - of - peak phases ) .",
    "the off - pulse and intra - peak phases of psr j0633 + 0632 were defined by applying a bayesian block algorithm adapted for weighted - counts light curves , described in the next section .",
    "years of _ fermi_-lat data . the off - pulse , and the intra - peak phases ( shaded regions )",
    "are defined by means of the bayesian block algorithm : ( 0.66 - 0.98 ) and ( 0.21 - 0.49 ) , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      we found that an efficient way to define the off - pulse phase range is by subdividing the pulse profile into ` bayesian blocks ' , and choosing the block with the lowest count rate .",
    "the intra - peak phase range is instead the lowest block between the two peaks .",
    "the bayesian blocks algorithm was proposed by @xcite : the algorithm defines the phase ranges of constant rate , called bayesian blocks , on the basis of the likelihood ratio test applied to a poissonian distribution .",
    "this is perfect for count light curves , but not for weighted pulse profiles , as in this case the weights are not integer values , and they do not follow a poissonian distribution . furthermore , the pulse profile is periodic , meaning that it does not have a well defined start and end .    in order to manage weighted counts , in our method the bayesian blocks",
    "are defined using the @xmath26 ratio test .",
    "specifically , given a light curve of weighted counts , the null hypothesis is that the light curve is flat , and it is fitted by a single block .",
    "the associated @xmath27 value for a single block is defined as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the weighted source counts in the @xmath30-th bin , and @xmath31 are the average weighted counts all along the light curve .",
    "@xmath32 is the total number of bins .",
    "the test hypothesis is that two blocks fit better than a single block .",
    "the @xmath27 of the two blocks hypothesis is @xmath33   \\label{chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the average weighted counts , and the weighted counts in the @xmath30-th and @xmath38-th bin of the first and second block , respectively .",
    "finally , the significance of the improvement given by two blocks rather than a single block is calculated by means of the f - test .",
    "if two blocks fit the data significantly better than a single block then the division point between the blocks is recorded and the first of the new blocks ( on the left ) is tested for further subdivision .",
    "the process continues until further subdivision is not significant or the block length reaches a predefined minimum length . in this way , the shortest , furthest - left significant block is defined .",
    "the subdivision restarts considering the remaining light curve on the right .",
    "the issue relating to the periodicity of the pulse profile is solved by selecting the starting ( and ending ) point of the light curve to be the phase of the highest peak .",
    "this is the choice that least affects the definition of the off - pulse region .",
    "the algorithm has three parameters : the number of bins of the pulse profile ( 100 ) , the minimum possible length of a block ( 3 bins ) , and the threshold on the two blocks significance ( 1.5@xmath19 ) .",
    "the values in parenthesis are the settings used for psr j0633 + 0632 .",
    "we tested this algorithm on all the @xmath1-ray pulsars detected so far with the _",
    "fermi_-lat , finding that these settings give good results for all the bright pulsars .",
    "having restricted the events to those selected from within the out - of - peak phases of psr j0633 + 0632 ( shaded phase ranges in figure [ psrj0633 ] ) , the analysis of the region around hess j0632 + 057 was performed by means of the binned maximum - likelihood method @xcite .",
    "two different tools were used to perform the spatial and spectral analysis : science tool gtlike and pointlike .",
    "gtlike is the official tool supplied with the publicly available science tools to fit spectral models to lat data .",
    "pointlike is an alternative binned likelihood implementation , optimised to localise the source and to characterise its extension .",
    "it operates quickly on long datasets making it better suited for iteratively constructing source models of a region .",
    "results from pointlike have been extensively compared with gtlike and found to be consistent ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the likelihood - ratio test statistic ( ts ) is employed to evaluate the significance of the @xmath1-ray flux of a test source .",
    "the ts value is defined to be : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the likelihood function maximised by adjusting all parameters of the model with and without the test source ( test and null hypothesis , respectively ) .",
    "a ts = 25 corresponds to a significance of just over 4@xmath19 when the testing source is modelled with a simple power law @xcite .",
    "figure [ tsmaps ] shows two ts maps of the @xmath41 region centred on hess j0632 + 057 .",
    "they are generated by testing for an additional point - like source located at the centre of each pixel ( of size @xmath42 ) . in the left panel of figure [ tsmaps ]",
    "is plotted a diffuse subtracted ts map , meaning that the spectral - spatial model for the null hypothesis includes only the galactic and isotropic emission models .",
    "in contrast , the right panel shows the residual ts map when the spectral - spatial model also includes the 2fgl sources within a radius of 20@xmath2 from the roi centre , in addition to the diffuse models .",
    "the 2fgl sources within 5@xmath2 of hess j0632 + 057 ( 11 sources ) are modelled with their flux normalizations allowed to vary , while the other 45 sources had all their parameters fixed to the values given in the 2fgl catalog .",
    "the spectral model of the isotropic diffuse emission had free normalization and the spectral model of the galactic diffuse emission is scaled by a simple power - law with normalisation and index free to account for any local variations in the diffuse emission . in the final fit of the data",
    "the fitted value for the power - law index is consistent with 0 within the fit error , indicating that no adjustment to the local galactic diffuse spectral shape was required .",
    "hess j0632 + 057 lies in a region of high galactic diffuse emission . since at low energies",
    "the diffuse emission is stronger , as well as its uncertainties , the following analysis was restricted to using data at @xmath43 mev .",
    "the ts maps in figure [ tsmaps ] show that the region around hess j0632 + 057 is not well modelled solely by the sources from the 2fgl catalogue .",
    "this is not unexpected considering that the 2fgl catalog was constructed with 2 years of _",
    "fermi_-lat data , while in this paper the dataset is almost doubled ( @xmath44 years ) . searching for emission from hess j0632",
    "+ 057  requires an accurate modeling of the entire region , and hence an improved source model of the region is required .",
    "the roi source model was iteratively improved by adding a new point source at the location of the highest residual ts and then re - calculating the residual ts map ( see sec .",
    "initially the 3@xmath45 region around hess j0632 + 057  was fine tuned before extending the radius to 5@xmath45 .",

    "there is no significant persistent , flaring or orbital phase - dependent emission .",
    "this makes hess j0632 + 057  unique among the handful of known @xmath1-ray binaries as the only source eluding detection by the lat .",
    "the 95% lat flux upper limit for the 0.1100 gev energy band of @xmath55 is consistent with the flux predicted by the one - zone ssc model shown in figure 4 of @xcite and @xcite , which assume a magnetic field of b = 70  mg and a radiation density of u@xmath56= 1  erg  @xmath57 .",
    "however , it is clear from the lat data that there must be a turnover in the vhe spectrum of hess j0632 + 057  below @xmath3136 gev in order for the _",

    "the `` striped pulsar wind '' model invoked by @xcite to explain the emission from psr b1259@xmath1263 could explain what is observed in hess j0632 + 057 , however a pulsar nature for the compact object in this system has not been confirmed and hence other models may offer feasible explanations .    numerical simulations were performed to calculate the radio flux fraction expected to be observed along the orbit by a pulsar with its radio beam pointing toward us , while absorbed by free - free interaction with the strong wind ( polar and disk ) from the companion .",
    "the results of the simulations lead us to exclude the truncation of the disk in favor of an indefinitely extended disk .",
