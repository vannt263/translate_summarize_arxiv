    "@xmath65 , we obtain `` geometric '' values of the fundamental frequencies @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 . indeed , the fft spectra exhibit corresponding peaks at frequencies of @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath68 close to these geometric values .",
    "the measured values of the fundamental fourier frequencies , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , are smaller than their geometric values .",
    "the difference is probably due to the fact that the effective area of the loop is smaller than the averaged geometric one .",
    "we found that quantum resistive contributions of both loops into the total rectified voltage can vary with temperature and bias current amplitude , both in absolute values and with respect to each other ( fig .",
    "[ voltage ] ) .",
    "unexpectedly , the amplitude of the peak corresponding to the fundamental frequency of the larger loop turned out to considerably exceed the amplitude of the peak corresponding to the fundamental frequency of the smaller loop [ the right inset of fig .",
    "[ voltage](a ) ] .",
    "in addition to the fundamental frequencies @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the fourier spectra contain higher harmonics of these frequencies , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , and difference and summation frequencies , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "let us now discuss the results obtained .",
    "it can be expected that at temperatures slightly below @xmath2 , the most efficient rectification of alternating voltage is realized when a joint effect of bias ac @xmath78 and loop circulating current @xmath8 periodically switch the structure from a superconducting @xmath6 state to that with finite resistance ( close to normal @xmath79 state ) and back . moreover",
    ", a time - averaged resistive state of the structure would correspond to the midpoint of the @xmath6-@xmath79 transition .",
    "we guess that there are two reasons as to why the difference between the magnitudes of circulating currents in the loops forming the figure - of - eight - shaped structure can result in different relative resistive contributions of the loops into the total rectified dc voltage in the structure . on the one hand , if @xmath80 in each circular loop , then the higher magnitude of the loop circulating current should result in a higher contribution into the total dc voltage . on the other hand",
    ", the relative contribution of each loop to the total dc voltage should be a nonmonotonic function of the bias ac amplitude @xcite @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , the contributions of the loops should reach their maximum at different values of the @xmath47 amplitude close to the critical current .",
    "a larger contribution of a loop should be expected when the average resistive state of the loop is closer to the midpoint of the @xmath6-@xmath79 transition .    to check the assumption that the difference between the magnitudes of circulating currents results in different relative contributions of the loops , we calculated circulating currents of each loop composing the structure at four values of @xmath58 shown in fig .",
    "[ voltage ] and in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ voltage](a ) .",
    "we used the ginzburg - landau theory for finite - wall - thickness asymmetric circular loops , neglecting radial variations of the order parameter and self - field generated by superconducting currents , which is reasonable because @xmath81 nm , @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath13 m , and @xmath12 @xmath13 m .",
    "the calculated circulating currents of the smaller @xmath84 and the larger @xmath85 loops are not strongly harmonic functions . in higher fields , @xmath84 and @xmath85 oscillations as well as",
    "the @xmath0 ones were damped .",
    "provided that @xmath80 in each asymmetric circular loop , nonharmonicity of loop circulating currents should result in the appearance of higher harmonics of loop fundamental frequencies in the fft spectra of the total dc voltage @xmath0 measured in the structure . at temperatures",
    "@xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 k , the maximum magnitudes of the calculated circulating currents were equal to @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 in the smaller and the larger loops , respectively . here , the current values are given in microampere .",
    "so at these temperatures , a higher circulating current corresponds to a larger diameter of the loop . on the contrary , for circular loops ( cylinders ) with infinitely thin walls , @xcite the smaller",
    "the structure diameter , the higher the circulating current is . in our case , both walls of each asymmetric loop have two finite thicknesses , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , nonzero terms containing @xmath100 are included in the expression for circulating current .",
    "@xcite a larger value of @xmath100 can result in a smaller value of the circulating current .    using the maximum values of the calculated circulating currents and experimental magnitudes of the critical current @xmath57 , we can estimate how close the average resistive state of each loop with all parameters shown in fig .",
    "[ voltage ] and the right inset of fig .",
    "[ voltage](a ) can be to the midpoint of the @xmath6-@xmath79 transition .",
    "then , presupposed relative contributions of both loops to the total rectified dc voltage can be evaluated .",
    "the estimations showed that for each average resistive state of the loop there is a certain point in the @xmath6-@xmath79 transition .    at all parameters [ except the parameters for the right inset of fig .",
    "[ voltage](a ) ] , the point in the @xmath6-@xmath79 transition corresponding to the average resistive state of the smaller loop is nearer to the midpoint of the @xmath6-@xmath79 transition than the point corresponding to the average resistive state of the larger loop .",
    "therefore , the contribution from the smaller loop can be expected to be higher than that from the larger one . with the parameters shown in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ voltage](a ) , the point corresponding to the average resistive state of the larger loop is closer to the midpoint of the @xmath6-@xmath79 transition , whereas the point corresponding to the average resistive state of the smaller loop is closer to the region of the superconducting state .",
    "then , the contribution of the larger loop should be much greater than that of the smaller one .",
    "with the parameters given in fig .",
    "[ voltage](d ) , the bias ac amplitude @xmath47 considerably exceeds the critical current @xmath57 , and the average resistive states of both loops are very close to the normal state .",
    "this results in both a radical decrease in absolute values of both loop contributions to the total rectified voltage and a decrease in the difference between relative contributions of both loops .",
    "indeed , these estimated relative contributions of the loops forming the structure to the total rectified dc voltage agree with experimental relative contributions [ fig .",
    "[ voltage ] and the right inset of fig .",
    "[ voltage](a ) ] .",
    "the fft spectra of the @xmath0 functions contain frequencies close to the summation @xmath101 and difference @xmath102 frequencies . because @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the @xmath101 and @xmath102 frequencies are directly proportional to the sum and difference of the loop effective areas , respectively .",
    "the presence of the @xmath101 and @xmath102 frequencies in the spectra points out to the interaction ( nonlinear coupling ) between the loops .",
    "let us consider possible mechanisms of the interaction .",
    "the magnetic inductive coupling between both circular loops of the figure - of - eight structure can qualitatively explain the appearance of the @xmath102 frequency .",
    "however , the interaction should be weak because of the structure geometry .",
    "so , the inductive coupling between the two loops composing the figure - of - eight structure is ten times weaker than that between coaxial loops of the same dimensions .",
    "apart from circulating currents of both circular loops , an additional periodic magnetic - field - dependent closed current can appear along a figure - of - eight contour for which the requirement of superconducting fluxoid quantization is also valid .",
    "this additional closed current can qualitatively explain the appearance of the @xmath101 frequency .",
    "the magnitude of the additional current should be small .",
    "indeed , the magnitude of the fft spectral peak corresponding to the @xmath101 frequency was lower than the peak magnitude corresponding to the @xmath102 frequency .",
    "another possible reason is that the difference and summation frequencies can be due to electrodynamic interaction between the circular loops , realized through a common bias ac .",
    "a characteristic longitudinal scale of the interaction should be expected to equal the penetration depth of a nonuniform electric field @xcite into the superconducting structure .",
    "the scale considerably exceeds the superconducting coherence length @xmath105 .",
    "together with the oscillations of the loop circulating currents , weak oscillations of time - averaged absolute value of the order parameter versus magnetic field occur in both loops .",
    "when the bias ac with an amplitude close to critical passes through the figure - of - eight structure , both superconducting and normal components of the current become doubly modulated with the fundamental frequencies corresponding to both circular loops . because of electrodynamic coupling between the bias ac and both loop circulating currents , difference , summation , and other combination frequencies can arise . to better understand the mechanisms of this interaction , further experiments will be carried out .",
    "in conclusion , quantum oscillations of a rectified dc voltage @xmath0 as a function of magnetic field were measured in a superconducting circular - asymmetric figure - of - eight structure .",
    "the fourier analysis of the @xmath0 oscillations revealed relative contributions of both loops , forming the structure , into the total dc voltage .",
    "these contributions varied with the bias ac and temperature both in absolute magnitude and with respect to each other .",
    "the contribution of the loop is maximum when the average resistive state of the loop corresponds to the midpoint of the @xmath6-@xmath79 phase transition .",
    "an interaction between quantum states corresponding to the two circular loops was found .",
    "magnetic coupling , formation of an additional figure - of - eight contour for a periodic magnetic - field - dependent closed current , and electrodynamic coupling through a common bias ac can be the possible mechanisms of the interaction between the loops .",
