    "the number of multiply - imaged quasars lensed by galaxies has now reached roughly one hundred .",
    "the typical separation of these systems ranges from @xmath12 .",
    "they provide an valuable sample to constrain the cosmological constant , the hubble constant , and the mass profiles of lensing galaxies at intermediate redshift ( for an extensive review , see kochanek , schneider & wambsganss 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the search for multiply - imaged quasars by clusters of galaxies has been less successful .",
    "the initial search for wide - separation radio sources yielded no successful candidates between @xmath13 ( @xcite ) , and from @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also failed to find any wide - separation quasars between @xmath15 in the first 20-cm radio survey .",
    "the lack of cluster lensed radio sources is likely due to the small number of radio sources surveyed ( @xmath16 20,000 ) .",
    "the breakthrough came from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) where a large number of optical quasars became available .",
    "so far , there are approximately 46,420 spectroscopically confirmed broad - line quasars in sdss date release 3 .",
    "two spectacular cluster lenses were discovered in the sdss ( not limited to dr3 , see  [ sec : number ] ) .",
    "the first case was sdss j1004 + 4112 , a quadruply - imaged system with an separation of 14.6 arcsec ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster is at redshift of 0.68 , and the lensed quasar is at redshift 1.734 .",
    "a faint fifth image was later discovered ( @xcite ) , as were many other multiply - imaged background galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second case , sdss j1029 + 2623 , was a double - image system with a separation of 22.5 arcsec .",
    "the lensing cluster is likely at redshift 0.55 ( @xcite ) , and the background quasar at redshift @xmath17 .",
    "cluster lenses , just like galaxy - scale lenses , provide valuable constraints on the lens mass profiles .",
    "they are also important because the number of such lenses depend quite sensitively on the cosmology , in particular the matter power - spectrum normalisation , @xmath18 , and the matter density , @xmath19 .",
    "this sensitivity has already been explored using giant arc statistics where the lensed sources are background galaxies , rather than quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis by @xcite prefers a high @xmath18 universe .",
    "however , the study and other similar ones suffer from one deficiency , namely the properties of the lensed background galaxy population , in particular their redshift distribution , is not well known , so the conclusion is somewhat uncertain .    in comparison ,",
    "the quasar population has a much better - known redshift distribution , and so does not suffer as much from the same deficiency , hence a careful analysis of the statistics of multiply - imaged quasars is complementary to those of giant arcs .",
    "of course , the number of known multiply - imaged quasars so far is very small ( two ) , compared to hundreds of known giant arcs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , even this small sample provides interesting constraints .",
    "for example , the analysis of @xcite of the first cluster lens , j1004 + 4112 , concluded that the @xmath18 value must be high , @xmath20 ( 95% confidence ) even for an inner density profile , @xmath21 , considerably steeper than the nfw profile ( @xmath22 for small @xmath23 , navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "many studies of clusters of galaxies prefer the nfw profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for such a shallower profile , the required @xmath18 would be even higher .",
    "another advantage of lensed quasars concerns the lens selection . for giant arc surveys ,",
    "observers first select clusters from optical or x - ray data and then take deep followup images , hence the discovery of giant arcs depends on how clusters are selected in the first place . on the other hand , lensed quasars",
    "are usually identified by examining quasars to see whether they are multiply imaged . in other words ,",
    "current arc surveys only observe biased directions whereas quasar lenses survey random line - of - sight .",
    "in addition , quasars are point sources , so one does not have complications arising from seeings , background source size and ellipticity distributions etc , thus it is much simpler to model the quasar source population .",
    "there have been many previous works to predict the abundance of large - separation quasar lensed by massive dark halos using simple spherical models ( @xcite ) . in particular , @xcite , using spherical clusters , found that wide - separation lensed quasars can be a powerful tool to measure @xmath18 and @xmath24 .",
    "using triaxial halo models , @xcite computed the abundance of quasars multiply imaged by clusters analytically and found that triaxiality significantly increases the expected number of lenses .",
    "@xcite presented the first predictions of multiply - imaged quasars using n - body simulated clusters in the a flat cosmology with @xmath2 , @xmath25 with @xmath26 . in this paper",
    ", we compare the predictions for the cosmology favoured by the three - year wmap result with the usual concordance cosmology .",
    "we also make more detailed predictions for cluster lenses as a function of image multiplicity , and study the brightness of the central images and their offset from cluster centres .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in  2 , we discuss the simulations we use and our lensing methodology . in  3 , we discuss the background source population , namely the quasar luminosity function . in  4 , we present the main results of the paper , and we finish in  5 with a summary and a discussion of the implications of our results .",
    "in this paper , we utilise two sets of simulations , one for the ` standard ' @xmath1 model with @xmath3 , and the other for the cosmological model given by the recent three - year wmap data with @xmath5 ( @xcite ) . for brevity",
    ", these two models will be referred to as @xmath10 , and wmap3 , respectively , and the corresponding cosmological parameters are :    1 .",
    "@xmath10 :   @xmath27 ; 2 .",
    "wmap3 : @xmath28 ,    where @xmath29 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the spectral index of the power spectrum .",
    "the assumed initial transfer function in each model was generated with cmbfast ( @xcite ) .",
    "notice that both @xmath18 and @xmath32 differ in these two models , and both will impact on the number of multiply - imaged quasars .",
    ".parameters for the two cosmological numerical simulations .",
    "the columns are cosmology , box size , number and mass of dark matter particles , and the softening length . [",

    ". both are @xmath0-body simulations which evolve @xmath34 dark matter particles in a large cubic box with sidelength equal to @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath10 simulation was performed using the @xmath33 code of jing & suto ( 2002 ) and has been used in @xcite to study the properties of giant arcs .",
    "we refer the readers to that paper for more details .",
    "the wmap3 simulation was carried out with gadget2 , and has been used by @xcite to compare the statistics of giant arcs in the @xmath10 and wmap3 models .",
    "similarly , in this work we will use them to compare the statistics of multiply - imaged quasars in these two cosmological models .",
    "we return to the issue of cosmic variance in  [ sec : cosmic_variance ] .",
    "dark matter halos are identified with the friends - of - friends method using a linking length equal to 0.2 times the mean particle separation .",
    "the halo mass @xmath36 is defined as the virial mass enclosed within the virial radius according to the spherical collapse model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for any given cluster , we calculate the smoothed surface density maps using the method of @xcite .",
    "specifically , for any line of sight , we obtain the surface density on a @xmath37 grid covering a square of ( comoving ) side length of @xmath38 centreed on each cluster .",
    "the projection depth is also chosen to be @xmath38 .",
    "notice that the size of the region is large enough to include all particles within the virial radius ( in fact , several virial radii for small clusters ) .",
    "particles outside this cube and large - scale structures do not contribute significantly to the lensing cross - section ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , so we will ignore their contributions here .    our projection and smoothing method uses a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) kernel to distribute the particle mass on a three - dimension grid and then the surface density is obtained by integrating along the line of sight ( see @xcite for more detail ) . in this work ,",
    "the number of neighbours used in the sph smoothing kernel is fixed to be 32 .",
    "we calculate the surface density along three orthogonal directions for each cluster .",
    "once we obtain the surface density of a dark matter halo , its lensing potential , @xmath39 , can then be easily calculated using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "many clusters of galaxies have a very luminous central galaxy .",
    "the effect of such brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) has been quantified by @xcite . for multiply - imaged systems with separations @xmath40",
    ", bcgs can enhance the cross - section by @xmath16 50% .",
    "following @xcite , we also artficially add a bcg at the centre of each cluster .",
    "this is obviously a simplification as bcgs are assembled as a function of time ; we briefly return to this issue in the discussion .",
    "the bcg is modelled as a truncated isothermal sphere .",
    "the mass of bcg is taken to be a fixed fraction of the host halo , @xmath41 and its velocity dispersion is given by @xmath42 the truncation radius is given by @xmath43 .",
    "see @xcite for more details .    in the following we will only present results including such a bcg , which approximately accounts for the effects of baryonic cooling at the centre of clusters .",
    "the effect of baryons in non - central galaxies is likely to be smaller .",
    "as the bcg is modelled as a truncated isothermal sphere , its lensing potential , @xmath44 , can be calculated analytically .",
    "the total lensing potential is a sum of the contributions from the ( pure ) dark matter halo and the bcg , @xmath45 .",
    "the deflection angle ( @xmath46 ) and magnification ( @xmath47 ) can be obtained by taking first - order and second - order derivatives with respect to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we calculate the bcg contribution to the deflection angle and potential analytically , and the dark matter halo contribution using fft as discussed above .    using these derivatives",
    ", we can create the mapping from the image plane to the source plane and obtain the critical curves and caustics .",
    "critical curves are a set of image positions with @xmath53 , and the caustics are the corresponding source positions .",
    "caustics play a crucial role in gravitational lensing as they divide the source plane into regions of different image multiplicities . whenever a source crosses a caustic , the image number either increases or decreases by two . for a quasar to be multiply - imaged ,",
    "it must lie inside one of the caustics .    to calculate the cross - section of a given separation of a multiply imaged quasar , we first find the smallest rectangle which encloses all the caustics , and then a regular grid is created dividing this rectangle into pixels of @xmath54 by @xmath54 .",
    "for each source position located on the grid , we find the corresponding image positions and magnifications ( @xmath47 ) using the newton - raphson method . for a given multiple - image system ,",
    "the number of images one can observe , @xmath55 , depends on the magnification of each image , the source intrinsic magnitude and the survey magnitude limit . for such systems , we sort the images according to the image magnifications and record the number of images @xmath55 and the maximum separation @xmath56 between these @xmath55 images .",
    "we then examine whether the multiple images satisfy the observational selection criteria ( see  [ sec : k - corr ] ) . for given lens and source redshifts , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , collecting systems that pass the selection allows us to construct a cross - section @xmath59 for lensing systems with at least @xmath55 images and separations larger than @xmath60 .",
    "the sdss photometric and spectroscopic quasar samples are magnitude limited , multiply - imaged quasars will be over - represented in such samples due to the lensing magnification ( @xcite ) . to account for this magnification ( or amplification ) bias ,",
    "we further divide the cross - section into 50 bins of @xmath61 from @xmath62 mag to 5 mag with a bin size of 0.2 mag , and obtain a differential cross - section @xmath63 .    as in @xcite",
    ", we can obtain the total cross - section per unit comoving volume by summing over the contributions of all the clusters : ( , > | m , , ) = _ i ( , > | m , , ) v , where @xmath64 is the average cross - section of the three projections of the @xmath65-th cluster at redshift @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the source redshift , and @xmath66 is the comoving volume of the simulation box .",
    "then , accounting for the magnification bias ( for more detailed descriptions , see sect .",
    "3.1 ) , the predicted number of large - separation lens can be derived as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of quasars brighter than the sdss @xmath65-band magnitude @xmath65 in the redshift interval from @xmath58 to @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the flux limit , and @xmath71 is the proper volume of a spherical shell with redshift from @xmath57 to @xmath72 .",
    "we used 22 simulation output with redshift from 0.1 to 2 , and selected the 600 ( for @xmath10 ) or 400 ( for wmap3 ) most massive clusters in each output to calculate the total lensing cross - sections .",
    "the lowest masses of clusters in these two cosmologies are @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively at redshift 0.5 .",
    "the integration step size of @xmath57 is the same as the redshift interval of simulation output ( @xmath75 ) and the source redshift is at 0.7 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0 , 3.5 , 4.0 , 4.5 , 5.0 and 5.5 .",
    "to make accurate predictions for the frequency of multiply - imaged quasars , we must specify the quasar luminosity function as a function of redshift and luminosity . following @xcite",
    ", we will use a double power - law to parameterise the quasar luminosity function ( m , z)= , [ eq : lf ] where @xmath36 is the absolute magnitude in a filter , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the characteristic density and magnitudes respectively in a certain band .    for the low redshift ( @xmath78 ) quasars",

    "the characteristic luminosity in the @xmath79-band , @xmath83 , is described by a second - order polynomial of redshift : m^_g(z)=m^_g(0)-2.5(k_1z+k_2z^2 ) , where @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    for high redshift , @xmath87 , quasars",
    ", we take the parameters from @xcite , which were obtained from a joint analysis of the goods and sdss data .",
    "the best fit to the luminosity function as a function of the monochromatic 1450 magnitude , @xmath88 , gives @xmath89 , @xmath81 ; the data also prefers a pure density evolution with an exponential form : ^(z)=^_(z=2)e^k_z[(1+z)-3 ] , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the characteristic monochromatic luminosity , @xmath92 , is fixed at @xmath93 .    for a given flux limit @xmath70",
    ", we can easily obtain the total number density of quasars @xmath94 in the redshift space for @xmath78 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , the quasar luminosity function is not well constrained from redshift 2.1 to redshift 3.5 . for a given magnitude limit @xmath70",
    ", we estimate the number density of quasar with redshift @xmath95 by linear interpolation as a function of redshift of the quasar number densities with the same absolute magnitude . for a given redshift @xmath96 , we first calculate the corresponding absolute magnitude , @xmath97 for each apparent magnitude @xmath65 .",
    "we then convert this , using k - corrections ( see  [ sec : k - corr ] ) , into corresponding @xmath79-band and the 1450 monochromatic absolute luminosities at @xmath98 and @xmath99 at redshift @xmath96 .",
    "since we know @xmath100 , @xmath101 , we obtain the @xmath102 by linear interpolation : ( m_i , z)=. [ eq : zmiddle ] we can then simply integrate the above equation to derive the number density of quasars per square degree for any limiting magnitude @xmath65 .",
    "we also consider the incompleteness of quasars at redshift from 2.3 to 3.6 as in @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic and photometric surveys depend on colour selection and the colours of quasars and stars are not easy to disentangle in this redshift range .",
    "so we assume that only 60% of quasars in this redshift interval are found by the sdss .",

    "the faint sdss photometric quasar survey covers a larger area , @xmath111 , with a flux limit of @xmath112 for @xmath108 and @xmath113 for @xmath110 ( @xcite ) . to select lenses in the photometric and spectroscopic quasar samples",
    ", we require the brightest image to be brighter than the magnitude limit given above , and other images to be brighter than @xmath114 , after accounting for their magnifications .",
    "the fainter limit for other images is because of fiber collisions in the sdss , usually only one quasar image will be spectroscopically targeted , while other quasar candidates have to be confirmed with other , typically larger telescopes that can reach much fainter magnitudes .",
    "this is what actually occurred for the discovery of the first two lenses , and so we will adopt this selection criterion , similar to @xcite . notice that some images may still be missed if they are below the flux limit , even after the magnification , so the observed number of images may be smaller than the intrinsic number .",
    "notice that the photometric sample goes almost two magnitudes deeper than the spectroscopic sample for quasars below redshift 2.5 ( magnitude limit 21.0 vs. 19.1 ) , but only slightly deeper for high redshift quasars ( 20.2 vs. 20.5 ) . as a result ,",
    "the photometric sample has many more low - redshift quasars compared with the spectroscopic sample .",

    "furthermore , we reproduce the quasars distribution as a function of redshift and magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lf ] ) using our luminoisty functions .",
    "this distribution is directly comparable with the observations and model independent .",
    "our calculation in each cosmology is based on this quasar distribution .",
    "so the small cosmological dependence of the luminosity function is accounted for .",

    "the dashed lines show the corresponding results of @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with theirs for the two low redshift intervals , but for the highest redshift interval ( @xmath118 ) , our quasar surface density is roughly a factor of two of that of @xcite between @xmath119 and 22 . as we use the updated results by @xcite , our luminosity function may be more realistic than that in @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasising , however , that this difference has only moderate effects on the number of predicted multiply - imaged quasars because most ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) of the lensed sources are below redshift 3 for the photometric and spectroscopic samples .",

    "the number density in the last bin of the wmap3 mass function is higher than prediction by a factor of @xmath16 6 due to the presence of just 6 clusters .",
    "the low number of clusters at the high mass end in the wmap3 model implies that ideally a larger simulation box is required to sample at least a similar number of massive clusters as in the @xmath10 model .",
    "the two bottom panels show the differential cross - section as a function of the cluster mass in the two simulations .",
    "the total area under each curve is normalised to unity .",
    "the clusters are at redshift 0.5 and the sources are at redshift 2.5 .    the mass distribution of sdss j1004 + 4112 was studied in @xcite using x - ray data .",
    "assuming isothermality and an nfw profile for the cluster , the virial mass was derived to be @xmath176 .",
    "the mass of sdss j1029 + 2623 is more uncertain .",
    "the image separation implies a cluster velocity dispersion @xmath177 ( see @xcite ) , and this can be converted to @xmath178 using cluster scaling relations , but with a large error bar .",
    "the box size of @xmath10 simulation appears to be large enough to produce such massive clusters easily . on the other hand , there are only  20 clusters in the last three bins in the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] , such a small number may be not sufficiently sample the clusters well in the mass - concentration space and result in a relatively large errors of differential cross - section at the very high - mass end .",
    "but the final optical depth is the integration of the mean cross - section as a function of redshift , which will suppress the final variance .",
    "however our wmap3 simulation does suffer seriously from the cosmic variance and appears to have too many very massive clusters compared to the theoretical prediction . in @xcite , we ran a lower resolution simulation in the wmap3 model which evolves @xmath34 dark matter particles in a box with sidelength of @xmath179 . due to the larger volume , that simulation better samples the high mass tail of the cluster mass function and merger events . comparing these simulations",
    ", we found that the smaller simulation over - estimates the number of giant arcs by a factor of 2 .",
    "for the same reason , the number of wide - separation lensed quasars in the wmap3 may be over - estimated by a similar factor .",
    "the wmap3 cosmology is compatible with observations only at @xmath180 and @xmath181 level for an over - estimation by a factor of 1.5 and 2 respectively .",
    "however , we caution that to more properly account for the cosmic variance , it is necessary to run a much larger simulation with high resolutions in order to sample the cluster mass function sufficiently .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the number of multiply - imaged quasars lensed by clusters of galaxies in the sdss photometric and spectroscopic quasar samples . a similar",
    ", earlier attempt was made by @xcite .",
    "this study extends their study by exploring how the predictions depend on the cosmology .",
    "we also study the multiply - imaged quasars as a function of image multiplicity , and explored in some detail the properties of central images .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows    1 .",
    "we found that the predicted multiply - imaged quasars with separation @xmath6 in the sdss photometric sample ( with an effective area 8000 deg@xmath7 ) is about 6.2 , and about 2.6 in the spectroscopic sample ( with an effective area 5000 deg@xmath7 ) in @xmath10 model .",
    "these numbers are reduced by a factor of @xmath167 or more in the wmap3 model .",
    "the predicted cluster lens peaks around redshift 0.5 , and 90% are between 0.2 and 1 .",
    "this distribution is largely independent of cosmology , and similar for both the photometric and spectroscopic samples .",
    "the relative number of systems with @xmath9 images and those with @xmath182 images is about 1/3.5 .",
    "this ratio is largely cosmology independent , and similar for both the photometric and spectroscopic quasar samples .",
    "4 .   because we modelled the bcgs as a truncated isothermal sphere , this creates a region , comparable in size to the angular einstein radius of the bcg , inside which the central image disappears . for most central images in five - image configurations are quite faint , and close to the cluster centres . for three - image systems ,",
    "the central images are brighter and further away from the cluster centres .",
    "one uncertainty in our calculation is the ad hoc inclusion of a bcg at the centres of clusters at all redshifts . in reality , the bcgs are assembled as a function of time , and so it is interesting to estimate the effects of an evolving population of bcgs .",
    "we adopt a simple model by assuming there are no bcgs at the centres of clusters above redshift 0.5 .",
    "hennawi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) finds that the optical depth decreases by a factor of 1/3 if all the bcgs are ignored .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "6 , the contribution of clusters with @xmath183 is about 1/2 of the total cross - section .",
    "thus if we remove all the bcgs from the clusters above redshift 0.5 , the optical depth will decrease roughly by @xmath184 .",
    "so the evolution effect may be modest . in any case",
    ", such a decrease in the optical depth will make the match between the wmap3 model and the observations slightly worse .",
    "our predicted numbers of multiply - imaged quasars for both the photometric and spectroscopic samples are lower than those by @xcite roughly by a factor of 2 in the @xmath10 cosmology .",
    "part of this difference is due to the slightly higher @xmath18 ( 0.95 ) adopted by @xcite .",
    "the abundance for typical lensing clusters around @xmath185 at redshift 0.5 is about 30% higher than that in our model with @xmath3 .",
    "their higher @xmath18 not only provides more massive clusters but also makes the cluster formation earlier and with higher concentration ; both may increase the predicted number of cluster lenses .",
    "our quasar luminosity function is similar to those adopted in @xcite for the low redshift intervals , but is a factor of 2 higher than that adopted in their paper for the high - redshift interval ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "so the difference in the source luminosity function goes in the opposite direction .",
    "note , however , the number of such higher redshift quasars is small and so this should not impact significantly on the overall predicted large - separation lenses ( see fig . [",
    "fig : source ] ) .    for galaxy - scale lenses ,",
    "the number of lenses with @xmath9 is about one half of that with @xmath10 .",
    "for example , the statistical sample of the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ) has 13 lenses , 6 have at least 4 images ( including one with 6 images , @xcite ) .",
    "our study indicates the ratio is about 0.3 for cluster - scale lenses , about a factor of 1.5 smaller .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite .",
    "using a triaxial cluster model , they found the ratio is 0.2 for inner density profile @xmath187 and 0.4 for @xmath188 .",
    "the comparison between the two studies is , however , not straightforward as we use different definitions of @xmath189 and their study also all of the faintest images in the multiply imaged systems can be detected , while in our study we assume certain magnitude limits for the images to be observable ( see  [ sec : k - corr ] ) .",
    "if we relax the magnitude limit to @xmath190 , then we find that our ratio is changed to 0.35 , still within the bracket of the two values of @xcite for different inner density slopes .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , this ratio depends on a number of parameters , including the shape of the lensing potential and the density slopes .",
    "it appears that this is mainly because of the shallower inner density slope which causes the factor of 1.5 difference in the relative numbers between cluster lenses and galaxy lenses .",
    "one striking result of this study is the reduction in the predicted number of large - separation lenses in the wmap3 model compared with that in the @xmath10 model .",
    "this reduction is comparable to that for the giant arcs ( @xmath133 ) in these two cosmologies .",
    "however , we emphasise that the uncertainty for the quasar sample is smaller , because the source population is reasonably well known ( see  [ sec : lf ] ) .",
    "there are two lens systems , j0114 + 4112 and j1029 + 2623 , have been discovered in the sdss spectroscopic sample with an effective area of @xmath191deg@xmath129 . in the @xmath10 model , from fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] , the number of lenses with separation larger than @xmath139 quadrupole - images and @xmath140 double images are 0.7 and 1.2 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with what we have discovered in the sdss .",
    "however , for the wmap3 model , the number of lenses with separation larger than @xmath139 quadrupole - images and @xmath140 double images are 0.09 and 0.14 for the whole spectroscopic sample .",
    "assuming a poisson distribution , the probability to observe two quasar systems in the wmap3 model is @xmath16 8% and decreases to 4% or lower if we account for the cosmic variance in our simulation ( see  [ sec : cosmic_variance ] ) .",
    "so it appears that a higher @xmath18 or a higher @xmath19 is preferred by the data .",
    "clearly it is desirable to have a much bigger sample of large - separation multiply - imaged quasars .",
    "our study shows that most cluster lenses have already been discovered in the sdss spectroscopic quasar sample , but several more candidates may yet to be discovered in the photometric sample .",

    "<S> we use high - resolution @xmath0-body numerical simulations to study the number of predicted large - separation multiply - imaged systems produced by clusters of galaxies in the sdss photometric and spectroscopic quasar samples . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate the condensation of baryons at the centre of clusters by ( artificially ) adding a brightest central galaxy ( bcg ) as a truncated isothermal sphere . </S>",
    "<S> we make predictions in two flat cosmological models : a @xmath1 model with a matter density @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ( @xmath10 ) , and a model favoured by the wmap three - year data with @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( wmap3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the predicted multiply - imaged quasars with separation @xmath6 is about 6.2 and 2.6 for the sdss photometric ( with an effective area 8000 deg@xmath7 ) and spectroscopic ( with an effective area 5000 deg@xmath7 ) quasar samples respectively in the @xmath10 model ; the predicted numbers of large - separation lensed quasars agree well with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers are reduced by a factor of 7 or more in the wmap3 model , and are consistent with data at @xmath8 level . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted cluster lens redshift peaks around redshift 0.5 , and 90% are between 0.2 and 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of systems with at least four image systems ( @xmath9 ) and those with @xmath10 is about 1/3.5 for both the @xmath10 and wmap3 models , and for both the photometric and spectroscopic quasar samples . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bcg creates a central circular region , comparable to the einstein ring of the bcg , where the central image disappears in the usual three - image and five - image configurations . if we include four image systems as an extreme case of five - image systems ( with an infinitely demagnified central image ) , we find that 68% of the central images are fainter by a factor of 100 than the brightest image , and about 80% are within @xmath11 of the bcg .    </S>",
