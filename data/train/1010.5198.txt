    "creep is the time deformation of a material under the application of a mechanical load that is below its overall mechanical strength . in many cases ,",
    "creep can lead to the failure of the material after a finite time after the application of the load , and this kind of creep rupture can be one of the mayor concerns in mechanical design .",
    "creep rupture follows a sequence of three temporal stages before complete failure occurs .",
    "immediately after the load is applied , there is a so - called primary creep regime in which the strain rate in the material decays as a function of time .",
    "this is known as the andrade creep regime @xcite .",
    "the second stage is one of almost constant strain rate , that gives way eventually to the tertiary regime of accelerated creep that leads to complete material collapse . in the andrade regime and the tertiary creep regime the strain rate",
    "is observed to follow power laws in time . in the andrade regime ,",
    "strain rate @xmath1 decreases as a negative power of the time elapsed since load application @xmath2 , whereas in the tertiary creep regime , strain rate increases as a negative power of the time remaining to failure , i.e. @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the time at which failure is observed .",
    "experimental values typically observed for the exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 are both close to 1 @xcite . the time to failure @xmath4 depends strongly on the applied load @xmath7",
    "actually , if @xmath7 is below some threshold value @xmath8 , failure does not occur , and only the initial andrade regime towards a finite deformation state is observed .",
    "time to failure is expected to diverge continuously as @xmath9 , however , the precise experimental determination of this dependence suffers of the problem that the determination of @xmath4 is typically destructive , and different samples have to be used for different values of applied stress , introducing sample - to - sample fluctuations that complicate the determination of @xmath4 .",
    "the typical dependence of strain rate vs time displays another interesting feature : the time at which strain rate is minimum @xmath10 , is typically a conserved fraction of the time to failure , independently of the level of applied stress , and details of the samples .",
    "@xcite find a ratio @xmath11 for a set of fifteen samples with different characteristics .",
    "in addition to the average evolution of the creep process , characterized by the temporal evolution of the strain , or the strain rate , there is relevant information that can be extracted by analyzing the details of the temporal evolution .",
    "in fact , creep proceeds typically through bursts of activity in which the strain increases in a finite amount , followed by periods of quiescence .",
    "this pattern of activity , which is reminiscent for instance of the barkhaussen noise in ferromagnets , or earthquakes in seismic processes , can be typically followed by recording the patterns of acoustic emission generated by the sample @xcite .",
    "there is a variety of models that have been used to explain part of the phenomenology previously described about the creep rupture of materials .",
    "most of them are based in the idea of  fiber bundles \" , in which the material is considered as a set of fibers that fail individually when some threshold value of stretching is overpassed @xcite . the stress carried by fibers that break",
    "is distributed to the intact fibers of the system , and this generates a feedback process that can produce the total failure of the system .",
    "the description of creep phenomena by the use of fiber bundle model requires the consideration of some time dependent process in the model . in some cases",
    ", it is assumed that the external load increases with time , usually this increase is thought to be quasistatic .",
    "this is the ",
    "static \" fbm considered for instance by @xcite . in a slightly different approach introduced by @xcite , the external load is kept constant , but the system is endowed with some kind of viscoelastic behavior that produce a time dependent response .    an additional effort to set up a model that describes the full phenomenology of the three regimes of creep behavior has been made by @xcite .",
    "the authors show how previous versions of fbms fail to obtain realistic strain rate dependencies in the andrade and tertiary creep regime .",
    "they construct upon the previous models by modifying the rheological properties of the fibers , in order to reproduce these regimes .",
    "the final conclusion is that an eyring rheology is able to predict a power law in the andrade and tertiary creep regimes .",
    "the crossover time @xmath10 found with this model is equal to @xmath12 , and the dependence of time to failure with the excess stress @xmath13 is @xmath14 .",
    "despite the fact that the modeling presented by @xcite is able to reproduce many of the observed properties of the creep behavior of the material , i would like to present here an alternative model that also explains many characteristics of the creep process .",
    "so first of all it is necessary to explain why we need another model of creep rupture .",
    "the model of @xcite relies on the assumption that fibers respond through an ad hoc non - linear rheology .",
    "although the assumed non - linear behavior of each fiber can be considered realistic , as it is compatible with macroscopic phenomenology of thermal creep , to apply this macroscopic behavior to presumably microscopic elements leaves the impression that we have not reached a really fundamental description of creep . in ddition , this model ( as the viscoelastic model of @xcite ) produces a temporal breaking sequence of fibers in a rigorous one - by - one process , i.e. , avalanches of many breakings do not occur .",
    "this forces the authors in @xcite not to consider the fitting of acoustic emission data . in this respect",
    ", the model presented by @xcite seems a bit more realistic , however it displays some non - physical behavior also ( see below ) .",
    "another additional minor points is that the model in @xcite is not able to explain other robust features of the experiments , such as the already mentioned constant ratio @xmath15 .",
    "the second set of reasons to propose a different model for creep rupture comes from the fact that the ` new ' model i will present , is not actually new , nor devised specially to treat this problem , but is a model that has proved very successful in reproducing the characteristics of temporal sequences of seismic events , giving in particular a very realistic description of aftershocks @xcite . with rather direct modifications , the modeling of the seismic phenomena can be adapted to model creep rupture with reasonably good results .",
    "as we will see , except for the possibility of breaking of elements , the model is linear , yet is able to reproduce much of the phenomenology that has required the consideration of non - linear rheology in previous attempts .",
    "this is an important conceptual improvement that justifies the consideration of this kind of model .",
    "the model is presented in the next section .",
    "results are contained in section iii , and section iv contains a summary and the conclusions .",
    "the model that will be presented here is based on the one that was introduced in @xcite , and that has been shown to produce realistic sequences of seismic events that quantitatively compare very well with actual seismic sequences . here",
    "i will rephrase the main ingredients of the model , focusing on its application in the context of creep rupture .",
    "i consider a set of @xmath16 linear elastic fibers , characterized by the value of their stiffness @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the fibers are considered to be equally loaded , i.e. , the same stretching @xmath19 is applied to all of them .",
    "fibers break when a maximum stretching value @xmath20 is reached .",
    "note that for the case of uniform stiffness , namely @xmath21 , the model corresponds to the usual fiber bundle model in the global load shearing ( gls ) scheme ( also known as local load shearing , or democratic fiber bundle ) as discussed extensively by @xcite , for instance . here",
    "i will modify the model presented by @xcite in the following way .",
    "let us suppose first of all that the fibers have all the same breaking strain @xmath22 , but that they are not anchored to the point of coordinate @xmath23 , but instead to some point of coordinate @xmath24 .",
    "this means that effectively , the stretching that has to be applied to break a particular fiber is @xmath25 .",
    "let us consider now the mechanical energy stored in the system at some given value of @xmath19 .",
    "this is given by    @xmath26    where the prime in the sum means that this is extended only to intact fibers , namely those with @xmath27 .",
    "the key new point in the system dynamics is to consider that the values of @xmath24 are not constant but they can evolve in time . to work on a safe physical basis",
    ", the evolution of @xmath24 will be such that the mechanical energy @xmath28 tends to be minimized in the process .",
    "the simplest dynamics one can assume for such a temporal variation consists in calculating @xmath29 as    @xmath30    for intact fibers , where i note the force on fiber @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "this would correspond to the modeling of each fiber as a linear combination of a harmonic spring ( with length @xmath33 ) plus a linear dashpot represented by the variable @xmath24 .",
    "this situation however is not appropriate for the case we are trying to model , since in particular , it implies that for any fixed stretching , eventually the system reaches a configuration of zero stress .",
    "this would correspond to a viscous fluid rather than to the creeping material we are trying to model . instead of the previous situation",
    "in which the temporal variation of @xmath24 is proportional to the force on the fiber @xmath31 alone , i propose to model creep assuming that the temporal variation of @xmath24 will be proportional to the _ fluctuation _ of the force in the neighborhood of the fiber @xmath31 . in the case",
    "all fibers are intact , it is direct to make explicit this prescription in the form of a conserving dynamics , namely    @xmath34_i=\\sum_j(f_i - f_j)\\ ] ]    where the index @xmath35 labels the four neighbors ( on a square lattice ) of the site @xmath31 .",
    "some care is however necessary when there are broken fibers , as they have in some sense come out of the game , and should not contribute to determine the temporal evolution of @xmath24 .",
    "the way in which this is done is the following .",
    "for each intact fiber @xmath31 , the temporal variation of @xmath24 is given by    @xmath36    where the index @xmath35 is now understood to run only onto intact neighbor fibers of the site @xmath31 .",
    "this is the proposed form of the time evolution of @xmath24 that i will study in detail in this work .",
    "a couple of things are worth to be noted . for a given value of @xmath19 , relaxation through eq .",
    "( [ dudt ] ) leads eventually to a situation in which the force onto any connected patch of intact fibers ( if any ) becomes uniform .",
    "this is the _ relaxed _ configuration that the system approaches , asymptotically .",
    "also , note that if all @xmath17 were equal , starting from a situation in which all @xmath37 , the previous evolution gives no time dependence of @xmath24 .",
    "this points to the crucial role played by the fact that in the present model the values of @xmath17 are widely distributed .",
    "i will concentrate mainly in the case in which an external constant force @xmath38 per fiber is applied to the system .",
    "when one fiber breaks , its load is immediately distributed onte the intact fibers , and this can produce the immediate failure of some other fibers , generating an avalanche . whether there is a stationary condition in which some of the fibers remain intact , or all fibers are eventually broken , depends on the applied load onto the system .",
    "the protocol to obtain the time evolution of the system , in particular , the sequence of fiber breaking is the following .",
    "previously to the application of the force , it is assumed that the system had plenty of time to relax , in such a way that the forces onto each fiber have become equal to zero everywhere .",
    "this means that all @xmath37 . at @xmath39 a nominal force @xmath38 per fiber",
    "is applied . assuming that initially all fibers are intact , the following sequence of steps is performed ( primed sums run only onto intact fibers ) :    1-",
    "the value of @xmath19 is calculated from @xmath40    2- check if any fiber has overpassed the breaking threshold , i.e. , if @xmath41 .",
    "if yes , consider this / these fiber / s as broken , and return to 1 .",
    "3- once no additional broken fibers occur in step 2 , increase time in a small time step @xmath42 , calculate the new @xmath24 values using ( [ dudt ] ) , and return to step 1 .    in this way , given an externally imposed value of the force @xmath38 , the time dependence of the stretching @xmath43 can be followed .",
    "@xmath43 will typically have periods of continuous evolution when no fibers breaks , and abrupt jumps occurring when fibers break .",
    "i emphasize that as the force carried by any fiber that breaks is distributed onto the intact fibers ( through steps 1 and 2 ) , a cascade of events can occur in which a finite number of fibers break exactly at the same time .",
    "this is an interesting variant with respect to other viscoelastic fiber bundle model @xcite , in which the breaking of fibers occurs in a strictly one - by - one sequence .",
    "a technical comment on the implementation of the previous rules is appropriate here . if we want to follow in full detail the bursts of breaking activity in the system , the time step @xmath42 in step 3 above has to be tuned in such a way that it never produces by itself the breaking of more than one fiber at a time",
    "this is easily done as the precise value @xmath44 necessary to break the next fiber can be calculated due to the linearity of the springs . then in this approach ,",
    "the value of @xmath42 is chosen dynamically at each passage through step 3 .",
    "this full detail process however , is very time consuming if we are only interested in the overall evolution of @xmath19 with time . in this case",
    ", a fixed value of @xmath42 is used , and in this time interval a few different fibers can break independently , however , the overall evolution of @xmath43 is very well reproduced . now i will present detailed results on the numerical implementation of this model .",
    "i already indicated that a broad distribution of stiffness @xmath17 is necessary for the model to be sensible .",
    "the precise form of this distribution is however not crucial for the observed properties .",
    "i will present results for a uniform distribution of @xmath45 between 0 and @xmath46 .",
    "additional calculations using a weilbull distribution have shown no appreciable qualitative differences .",
    "1000 . in the inset ,",
    "the time to failure @xmath4 for @xmath47 is plotted as a function of load , showing a power law divergence approaching @xmath48 .",

    "( b ) the approach of @xmath19 to its asymptotic value @xmath49 for the case @xmath50 is shown , and is seen to follow a power law behavior ( dotted lines have slopes -0.45 and -0.55 , for reference ) .",
    "the best determined asymptotic values of the strain as a function of the applied force are plotted in the inset , where the critical force @xmath51 is marked as a vertical dotted line . ]    depending on the value of the external load per fiber @xmath38 , the configuration of the system at a very large time corresponds to one of two different possibilities .",
    "if @xmath38 is lower than some critical value @xmath51 only a fraction of fibers break , and the value of @xmath19 remains bounded as @xmath52 , whereas if @xmath47 , all fibers break in a finite time .     as a function of time normalized to time - to - failure in the run",
    "away regime ( @xmath47 ) . the data shown correspond to an average over 120 realizations in systems of size 1000 @xmath53 1000 .",
    "in first panel time scale is linear , and the time of minimum strain rate has been emphasized . in the second panel time scale is logarithmic , to display the power law decay in the primary creep regime ( note however the larger - than - one exponent compared to usual andrade creep ) . in the last panel",
    "a logarithmic time scale approaching @xmath4 is used , to emphasize the power law increase of strain rate as approaching failure . ]    in fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) we see the evolution of the stretching @xmath19 as a function of time , for a single realization in a system of 1000 @xmath53 1000 fibers . the qualitative difference between the two regimes @xmath47 and @xmath50 , is clearly observable . for the case @xmath47 ,",
    "the time to failure in the system diverges as @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , as can be seen in the inset . for the present realization , @xmath51 turned out to be @xmath48 .",
    "this value shows rather large fluctuations in different realizations . in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , i show the approaching of @xmath19 to the asymptotic values , where a power law dependence is clear .",
    "the asymptotic values have been adjusted to obtain the best power law fitting , and they are shown as a function of @xmath38 in the inset .",
    "it is seen that they follow a smooth behavior as @xmath51 is approached , without obvious signs of any singular behavior .",
    "the power law approach of @xmath19 to the asymptotic values is compatible with the andrade creep law .",
    "note however that the exponent @xmath56 corresponds to a dependence of the strain _ rate _",
    "@xmath1 of the form @xmath57 , whereas the usual exponent for strain rate in the andrade regime is about 2/3 .",
    "note however that the usual andrade regime for @xmath58 has eventually to cross over to a different dependence that guarantees a finite strain at infinite time , ( otherwise the lower - than - one exponent would produce a divergent strain ) . here",
    "the larger - than - one exponent obtained gives a finite strain at infinite time .    to make a better comparison with the results presented by @xcite , in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] i present results for @xmath47 , showing the values of strain rate in the system @xmath59 , as a function of @xmath60 , under different scaling of the temporal axis . in the first panel",
    "the temporal axis is linear , and rescaled with the time to failure @xmath4 .",
    "here we see that @xmath1 displays qualitatively the three mayor creeps stage before rupture : a primary regime of decreasing creep rate , a second regime of almost constant creep , and a tertiary regime of accelerated creep towards failure .    from this figure",
    "we see that the time at which the creep rate is minimum is between at 0.6 - 0.7 of @xmath4 , independently of @xmath38 , a result that was observed to occur systematically in real samples , and that was not captured by the models available up to now .",
    "the logarithmic temporal scale in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , shows that the first stage of creep in the model corresponds indeed to an andrade regime of potential decay of creep rate with time .",
    "the exponent observed for this decay is seen to be about 1.3 , which is larger than the usually observed exponent that is typically near 2/3 .",
    "the logarithmic plot with respect to @xmath61 in panel ( c ) contains a very interesting outcome of the model : strain rate shows a tendency to diverge at @xmath4 as @xmath62 , which is in fact the result that is observed in a variety of experimental cases .",
    "it has to be reminded here , that fiber bundle models provide typically a divergence of strain rate as @xmath63 , whereas the model by @xcite obtains a systematic @xmath62 dependence relying on a specific non - linear choice for the rheology of the fibers .",
    "an interesting additional point on the  divergence \" of @xmath1 at @xmath4 has to be noticed .",
    "although the plot in fig .",
    "[ f2](c ) shows an increase of @xmath1 by about two orders of magnitude compatible with a @xmath62 dependence , this behavior can not be extrapolated to @xmath64 . in fact , if this was the case , then the value of @xmath19 itself would diverge at @xmath4 but this is nonsense : there are no fibers that can withstand an arbitrarily large deformation .",
    "the situation is that @xmath1 increases as @xmath62 ( and @xmath19 as @xmath65 ) up to some time slightly before @xmath4 , at which a macroscopic event breaks all remaining fibers ( which is a finite fraction of the total system ) all of the sudden .",
    "we will confirm this scenario in the next section where i concentrate on the study of bursts of activity in the system .",
    "the results in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] focus on the average behavior of the system , namely , the evolution of the stretching @xmath19 or its time derivative @xmath1 on time , and are indications that the model is able to capture in a quite realistic way the time evolution of strain that is observed in materials experiencing creep rupture .",
    "now we will see that fluctuation in these quantities , associated in particular to the existence of discrete breaking events , reveal also very interesting behaviors that can be compared for instance with results of experiments on acoustic emission .",
    "1000 , for a load slightly larger than critical ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the average burst size @xmath67 as a function of time is indicated in the inset , in log scale ( the power law of the straight line has an exponent 0.25 ) .",
    "the cumulative number of events @xmath68 , and the cumulative number of broken fibers @xmath69 as a function of time is shown in the panel below . ]",
    "some previous work have focused on the size distribution of bursts . however , in some other models the burst do not occur exactly as a function of time under a constant force as in our case . in the much studied static model considered in particular by @xcite , it is assumed that the external force increases quasi - statically in time , then the bursts occur because @xmath38 is increasing , and not directly because of the existence of creep phenomena .",
    "anyway this is a case that has been studied in much detail , and is the one with which we should compare , also because there are interesting analytical predictions for the size distribution of bursts in this case . in fact , it is known that if bursts are counted during the whole load process , from @xmath70 to complete failure , the number of bursts of size @xmath71 follows a power law of the form @xmath72 , with @xmath73 . if however , the size of the bursts is collected only in a small time interval before breaking occurs , the exponent predicted is @xmath74 . some other viscoelastic models , as the one by @xcite produce a one - by - one breaking of fibers , and in that case a non - trivial size distribution of events can not be defined .",
    "the model of @xcite seems to be more realistic in this respect , and the @xmath73 and @xmath74 power laws for the total and close - to - rupture avalanches have been obtained in this case also .",
    "the model we are studying here gives a non trivial time sequence of bursts for any fixed vale of @xmath38 .",
    "in fig . [ f3 ] we see a typical time sequence of all breaking events in the system , for a value of @xmath38 slightly above the critical value @xmath51 .",
    "the cumulative number of broken fibers @xmath69 is qualitatively very similar to the evolution of @xmath43 discussed in the previous section .",
    "this number is seen to approach a fraction of about 0.55 of @xmath16 as @xmath75 approaches @xmath4 . at this point ,",
    "a macroscopic breaking event occurs , in which the rest of the system breaks .",
    "note that the fraction of fibers that breaks in this single event ( about @xmath76 ) is rather independent of the value of @xmath16 itself , and on the value of @xmath38 ( assumed larger than @xmath51 ) .",
    "the existence of this macroscopic breaking event is reasonable in the present model , where the breaking of a fiber implies the immediate load increase on all the other fibers . in a more realistic situation , particularly as the time of global failure is approaching , even very small delays in the process of redistribution of stresses will have an important influence on the dynamics of failure .",
    "i expect that this consideration results in a continuous evolution of @xmath69 towards @xmath16 at @xmath4 in that case .",
    "the results for the the average size @xmath77 of the bursts as a function of time ( inset in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) shows that @xmath77 increases as a power law as @xmath4 is approached , namely @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .    .",
    "results are presented for different time intervals , namely @xmath80 $ ] for different values of @xmath81 ( @xmath82 for this particular realization ) .",

    "the complete burst distribution ( @xmath84 ) shows a consistent power law with a decaying exponent around 2.8 . as @xmath81 increases , a crossover and a coexistence of two different power laws is observed .",
    "for @xmath88 the distribution tends to be described by a single power law with an exponent close to 1.5 .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar ( except for a slightly larger global exponent ) to those obtained in the models studied by @xcite and @xcite .    .",
    "different curves correspond to different detectability threshold @xmath89 , as indicated .",
    "a tendency to increase as a power law as @xmath4 is approached is observed , however , the exponent is dependent on the threshold used .",
    "two lines with exponents 0.2 and 0.5 are drawn for comparison . ]",
    "results for bursts sizes can be cast is a slightly different form in order to compare with available results on acoustic emission .",
    "in particular , one of the magnitudes that has been experimentally recorded is the cumulative energy released as a function of time , on approaching failure .",
    "it has been obtained @xcite that this magnitude shows a power law increase on approaching failure with a dependence of the form @xmath90 , with reported values for @xmath91 close to 0.25 .",
    "the experimental detection and processing of an acoustic signal involves some non - trivial steps that make the link with other physical properties of the system not a straightforward procedure .",
    "however , for the present model we can reasonably consider that a burst involving the breaking of @xmath71 fibers produces an acoustic emission signal of energy @xmath92 , as the energy is experimentally defined as the time integral of the square of the amplitude detected @xcite . also , we should consider that events involving less that some minimum value @xmath89 of broken fibers are not detected because lack of sensitivity . in fig .",
    "[ fae ] i show the result for the accumulated energy released , calculated by integrating in time the values of @xmath93 , for events with @xmath71 larger than a threshold @xmath89 , corresponding to the sequence of events shown in fig .",
    "the results show the right tendency to diverge as @xmath64 .",
    "the definition of a well defined power law @xmath94 is however strongly dependent on the threshold @xmath89 that is used .",
    "values of @xmath91 between 0.2 and 0.5 can be obtained by changing @xmath89 .",
    "another quantity that is expected to provide information on microscopic processes in the system , and that is experimentally accessible in acoustic emission measurements is the distribution of inter event times ( iets ) , namely , the time intervals @xmath95 between successive breaking events in the system . for systems in",
    "which bursts occur in an uncorrelated time sequence , an exponential ( poissonian ) distribution of iets is expected .",
    "deviations from the exponential distribution might be taken as signs of non - trivial correlations in the activity of the system .",
    "however , this interpretation needs to be used with care , at least .",
    "in fact , in fig .",
    "[ f5](a ) we see the full sequence of and iets for a case of an applied load slightly below the critical value .",
    "the activity in the system decays in time towards a stationary state , and this is seen in the systematic increase of iet with time .",
    "the distribution if iets for this case is shown in part ( b ) of fig .",
    "it is seen there that iets show a power law distribution over more than seven orders of magnitude .",
    "the origin of this power law is however trivially related to the fact that the average iet as a function of time is itself a power law increasing function of time . by calculating the distributions of iets for partial time intervals ( shown in fig .",
    "[ f5](b ) ) makes clear that the power law appears only as a result of the integration of different time windows .     in a single realization in a 1000 @xmath53 1000 system , for a load slightly below the critical value .",

    "open symbols : distribution of interevent times for different time intervals @xmath98-@xmath99 , as indicated . ]",
    "it is thus evident that if non - trivial correlations between events exist , their signatures have to be searched within small time windows , in which the process can be considered stationary .",
    "this fact seems not to have been taken into account properly in some previous studies of iets distributions . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] i show results in a system of 400 @xmath53 400 for a force slightly above the critical value .",
    "a smaller system size is used in this case as it makes easier to detect correlations between events . in order to have a reasonable statistics ,",
    "i run different realizations , and the results have been combined by scaling the occurrence time of the events by the corresponding failure time @xmath4 of that particular realization .",
    "the results for the distribution of iets calculated for small time windows ( fig . [ f6](a ) ) , show a clear departure from the poissonian behavior .",
    "the curvature of the data indicates an increased probability of events to occur at small or large time intervals , whereas probability for intermediate time intervals is depressed .",

    "in the present paper a model to describe the creep rupture of materials has been presented .",
    "the model is in the class of viscoelastic fiber bundle models , and the viscoelastic relaxation mechanism considered involves a tendency to locally uniformize the stresses within the system . the model is a slight modification of one that has been proved useful to explain many characteristics of the sequences of events ( earthquakes ) in a seismic context .",
    "the only non - linear ingredient of the model is the possibility that fibers break when a maximum stretching is overpassed , in particular , i do not rely upon any non - linear rheology of the elements of the system . using this model ,",
    "i have obtained a description of the creep rupture process that in a few respects is an improvement with respect to the results in previous modeling . in particular , a regime of primary",
    "( andrade ) creep has been obtained , in which the strain rate has a power law dependence .",
    "the exponent of this dependence , is however larger than one , contrary to the usually observed exponent around 2/3 .",
    "a region of accelerated creep preceding rupture was obtain , in which the strain rate increases as @xmath100 , where @xmath4 is the time of failure .",
    "the time of minimum strain rate is systematically observed to occur at about 0.6 of the time of failure , coincident with experiments .",
    "bursts sizes distributions around rupture with an exponent close to 3/2 , and for the whole temporal sequence with an exponent slightly above 5/2 where obtained , much similar to results with previous modeling .",
    "the accumulated acoustic emission energy in the model was shown to increase as a power law as the time of failure is approached .",
    "the observed exponent is however dependent of the cut off used as a threshold for detecting events , and varies between 0.2 and 0.5 . a power law distribution of interevent times ( iets ) is trivially originated in a temporal variation of the average iet .",
    "analysis of iets in time windows of constant average activity reveal that the activity is correlated to some extent , displaying temporal clustering of the events .",
    "this was indicated to be reminiscent of the aftershocks that are produced with this model when used in the context of seismic phenomena .",
