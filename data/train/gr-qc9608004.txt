    "the theory of general relativity has predicted the existence of black holes in our universe .",
    "the relevance of black holes comes from their unavoidable emergence in complete gravitational collapse of astrophysical objects , as was first shown by oppenheimer and snyder @xcite .",
    "general relativity was formulated in a spacetime with four dimensions , of course . however , there are theoretical hints that we might live in a world with more dimensions . kaluza - klein theories , with the help of extra compact dimensions , try to unify the gravitational field to the other known gauge fields .",
    "string theory , a theory that embraces gravity and other interactions in a unified picture , lives , in its heterotic form , in ten dimensions .",
    "turning - off all other fields , the low - energy limit of string theory yields einstein - hilbert action plus terms involving quadratic powers in the curvature .",
    "for the quantum version of the theory , these quadratic corrections should be proportional to the gauss - bonnet term in order to give ghost - free meaningful interactions .    on the other hand",
    ", one can ask what is the most natural generalization of einstein gravity to other dimensions while keeping the same degrees of freedom .",
    "although pure general relativity can be formulated in other dimensions , when one goes to dimensions higher than four it is not anymore unique .",
    "the natural generalization is given by the lovelock action @xcite so that the field equations for the metric remain of second order .",
    "the theory can also be considered as the topological extension of eintein - hilbert action @xcite . in this theory",
    "new terms make their appearance by taking into the action the euler densities of the spaces with dimensions lower than the space in consideration .",
    "the euler density of the space in consideration yields a topological term only , with no pure dynamical content . in four dimensions",
    "one has to take in consideration two euler densities . the euler density of the 0-dimensional space which is proportional to @xmath1 , and the euler density of the 2-dimensional space , proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the determinant of the metric and @xmath4 the ricci curvature scalar .",
    "thus lovelock gravity in four dimensions reduces to einstein gravity , with action @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the cosmological and newton s constant , repectively . a similar construction and action",
    "is obtained for three dimensions . in six dimensions",
    "one has still to add the euler characteristic of four dimensional space , i.e. the gauss - bonnet term , to have the lanczos action , given by , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a new constant",
    ". for each two new dimensions there exists a new constant @xmath10 .",
    "these constants do not seem to have a direct physical meaning . in order to find a meaningful set of constants in any dimension @xmath11 ,",
    "it was proposed in @xcite a method which restricts drasticaly the number of independent constants to two , @xmath7 and @xmath6 , thus yielding a restricted lovelock gravity .",
    "this method separates , in a natural manner , theories in even dimensions ( @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ) from theories in odd dimensions ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "several static and cosmological solutions within lovelock gravity have been found @xcite . in the restricted setting of @xcite , where the independent constants are reduced to two , wormhole @xcite and black hole solutions have also been found @xcite both in even and odd dimensions .",
    "higher dimensional black holes may shed some light on the understanding of non - perturbative effects in quantum gravity .",
    "they can also expose which of the features of the usual four - dimensional black hole solutions remain in higher dimensions . since in general relativity black holes appear as the final state of gravitational collapse it is important to know if the black hole solutions found in lovelock gravity can , in an analogous manner , form from gravitational collapse .",
    "we will show that , indeed , black holes form from regular initial data . a possible scenario for the occurrence of this collapse in @xmath15 dimensions , would be in the very early universe , before the @xmath16 extra dimensions have been compactified . in turn",
    ", these newly formed higher dimensional black holes could play a role in the compactification process .    in this work",
    "we study gravitational collapse of a dust fluid in lovelock gravity within the context of the restricted coefficients found in @xcite .",
    "we will analyse the even dimensional case only . for",
    "the odd dimensional case see @xcite .",
