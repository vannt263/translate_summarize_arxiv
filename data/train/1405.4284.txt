    "in recent years dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) has been shown to be one of the most promising technique for hyperpolarizing nuclear spins .",
    "dnp increases the nuclear steady state polarization thanks to a transfer of magnetic order from the electron to the nuclear spins under microwave irradiation close to the electron larmor frequency ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the application of dnp has catalyzed major advances in the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) of low sensitivity nuclei in nanosized materials @xcite , in the high resolution nmr of biological samples @xcite and in _ in vivo _ real time imaging of biomolecules , hardly achievable with other methods @xcite . for preclinical magnetic resonance imaging ( mri )",
    "dnp is performed in solutions containing diamagnetic biomolecules labelled with @xmath1c and a small concentration of stable radicals .",
    "the mixture is cooled down to about @xmath6 k and , once the maximum @xmath1c polarization is reached , it is rapidly dissolved @xcite and injected _ in vivo _",
    ", where the metabolic processes accessed by the hyperpolarized substrates are monitored by means of @xmath1c mri or spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "while significant scientific and technological efforts are nowadays spent to introduce dissolution dnp into the clinical practice @xcite , there is growing interest in the fundamental investigation of the physical mechanisms driving dnp .",
    "the first basic description of the dnp phenomenology dates to a few decades ago @xcite , when different regimes , the solid effect , the cross effect and the thermal mixing ( tm ) , were defined depending on the magnitude of parameters such as the nuclear resonance frequency ( @xmath7 ) , the coupling among the electron and nuclear spins and the external magnetic field strength .",
    "the most common and relevant regime for the molecules utilized in metabolic imaging is seemingly the tm @xcite , which is effective when the electron resonance linewidth is larger than @xmath7 and the interactions among nuclear and electron spins are large enough to establish a common spin temperature for the two reservoirs .",
    "the tm regime is attained in pyruvic acid ( pa ) labelled with @xmath1c and doped with a concentration of trityl radicals ( @xmath8 ) of the order of 10 mm @xcite .",
    "pa has been up to date the most widely investigated system for _ in vivo _ dnp applications due to its role in glycolytic pathways @xcite and it can be considered as a prototype system to study the tm regime .",
    "several dnp experiments have shown @xmath1c polarizations approaching 20 - 30 % in pa doped with trityl radicals , at a temperature @xmath9 k and for a magnetic field ( @xmath10 ) of 3.35 tesla @xcite . in order both to optimize and to validate novel theoretical models of tm ,",
    "several investigations of the nuclear and electron relaxation processes around 1.2 k have been performed .",
    "the effect of relevant parameters , including the radical concentration @xcite , the concentration of gadolinium complexes @xcite , the nuclear concentration @xcite , the amount of matrix deuteration @xcite , the effect of microwave saturation and the field strength @xcite on the dnp performances of this molecule have been experimentally studied . remarkably very recently , the relevance of these physical quantities on dnp kinetics has also been considered in the development of novel models describing tm throughout a rate equation approach @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the role of the properties of the glassy matrix formed by the polarized molecules and radicals has not been investigated to a deep level .",
    "the importance to achieve a glassy matrix , yielding a homogeneous distribution of internuclear and electron - nuclear distances in order to optimize dnp , has been well recognized @xcite but a detailed study of the glassy dynamics of pa below 5 k and its effect on dnp has not been addressed up to date . in this regard",
    "the investigation of the spin dynamics of nuclei such as @xmath0h , not involved in tm , can eventually help to identify the relaxation processes driven by the coupling with the glassy dynamics .    in this paper a @xmath0h and @xmath1c nmr study of pure pa and pa containing trityl radicals at a concentration of 15 mm is presented .",
    "it is shown that the spin - lattice relaxation rate ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath0h and @xmath1c nuclei and of the radical electron spins show all a nearly quadratic @xmath12-dependence below 4.2 k. remarkably , while the @xmath0h spin - lattice relaxation rate ( @xmath13 ) is scarcely affected by the presence of paramagnetic radicals , the @xmath1c spin - lattice relaxation rate ( @xmath14 ) shows a sizeable enhancement upon paramagnetic doping . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath1c polarization build up rate is found to follow the same @xmath12 dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rates .",
    "all these results are explained , below 4 k , in terms of the glassy dynamics which characterizes the pa and by resorting , for @xmath1c dnp and spin - lattice relaxation , to the tm approach in the regime of good thermal contact between the nuclear and electron spin systems .",

    "the free radical trityl ox063 ( tris8-carboxyl-2,2,6,6-benzo(1,2-d:5-d)-bis(1,3)dithiole-4-ylmethyl sodium salt ) was kindly provided by albeda research . for nmr and dnp experiments ,",

    "the points collected after switching off mw could be fit to a simple exponential decay @xmath36 ( red curve).,height=257 ]    the electron spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath37 was derived indirectly by observing the effect of the time evolution of electron spin polarization on the nmr paramagnetic shift , and hence on the nmr signal , after the mw were turned off .",
    "in particular , after rf saturation the sample was polarized under mw irradiation for about 10 - 15 minutes .",
    "this time is enough for the electrons to reach steady state saturation and , additionally , to increase the @xmath1c signal - to - noise ratio significantly without having to wait the long time required to reach @xmath26 .",
    "subsequently , a low flip angle acquisition sequence was started , with 3@xmath24 flip angles and with time delay between consecutive fid acquisitions between 15 ms and 100 ms . around 3 - 9 s after the beginning of the sequence , mw were switched off and the @xmath1c nmr signal was followed for few seconds . during this time window , since the nuclear relaxation is orders of magnitude slower than the electronic one , the paramagnetic shift of the @xmath1c nmr line @xmath38 is found to vary proportionally to @xmath39 and to finally reach a plateau .",
    "the variation of @xmath38 correspondingly implies a modification of the shape of the nmr signal .",

    "@xcite have described a detailed procedure which allows to analyze the nmr signal shape and to quantify the @xmath1c nmr line shift . however as long as the precise determination of the line shift is not concerned , more workable approaches can be adopted to estimate @xmath37 . in this work",

    "first we shall start considering the different contributions to nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate in pa .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath13 arises from the dipolar @xmath0h-@xmath0h coupling while only a minor contribution ( @xmath87 ) due to @xmath0h-@xmath1c interaction is present , as it is evidenced by comparing @xmath13 in pa and upa samples .",
    "thus in pa @xmath13 can be expressed as the sum of independent terms @xmath88 where @xmath89 sums up the contributions from intra and intermolecular proton - proton dipolar interactions and @xmath90 originates from carbon - proton intramolecular interactions .",
    "accordingly , in upa the second term must be omitted .",
    "similarly , in pa the @xmath0h line broadening can be ascribed mostly to @xmath0h-@xmath0h interactions .",
    "in fact , it is nearly 30 khz in both pa and upa , which demonstrates that the line broadening due to the @xmath0h-@xmath1c interaction in the cooh group is much smaller than the @xmath0h-@xmath0h coupling . upon neglecting the @xmath0h-@xmath1c interaction , from the second moment of the proton line one",
    "can definitely estimate a mean square amplitude of the dipolar field probed by protons @xmath91 tesla .",
    "for @xmath1c the relevant intra and intermolecular heteronuclear dipolar interactions take place between the carboxyl @xmath1c and the methyl and hydroxyl protons .",
    "this coupling significantly overcomes the homonuclear @xmath1c-@xmath1c one .",
    "in fact , as it is described in detail in appendix 6.3 , according to the @xmath11 expression for homonuclear ( eq . [ eq16 ] ) and heteronuclear ( eq . [ eq17 ] ) interactions , the ratio @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the @xmath1c gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath94 the @xmath16h gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath95 indicates the average of the inverse sixth power of @xmath16h-@xmath1c distances @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the same quantity referred to @xmath1c-@xmath1c distances @xmath98 .",
    "this difference is simply due to the fact that the average intermolecular @xmath98 is significantly larger than the intramolecular @xmath96 .",
    "additionally , in the case of @xmath14 a further mechanism , involving the fluctuations of the chemical shift tensor ( csa ) , should be considered and thus , neglecting the weak homonuclear interactions , for pa one can write @xmath99 where @xmath100 refers to the fluctuations of the cs tensor .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath1c linewidth ( 5.9 khz ) can not be explained by considering the @xmath0h-@xmath1c dipolar coupling only . in this",
    "respect macholl et al.@xcite report a calculation of the 1-@xmath1c cs tensor parameters in pa , that retrieved the shielding anisotropy @xmath101 ppm and is thus responsible of a broadening at half height of the 1-@xmath1c line of @xmath102 khz at @xmath10=3.35 t and the larmor frequency @xmath103 .",
    "only the remaining broadening , at most 3.4 khz , should thus be ascribed to @xmath0h-@xmath1c couplings .",
    "this explains also why @xmath0h-@xmath1c yields a negligible contribution to the @xmath0h linewidth ( less than 10 % of the total width ) .",

    "one can start calculating that ratio under the assumption that the spectral density @xmath109 is the same for all the relaxation contributions and specializing their expression taking into account both the dipolar and csa relaxation mechanisms ( see eq.[eq16 ] and [ eq17 ] in appendix 6.3 )",

    "the common @xmath111 dependence of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath67 strikingly points to the presence of a common source of relaxation .",
    "in particular , while the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation is dominated by the fluctuations of the dipolar interactions with the other nuclei and with the electrons in pa15 ( discussed in subsection 4.3 ) , the electron spin - lattice relaxation of the diluted radicals is rather induced by scattering with the vibrational modes .",
    "therefore , the lattice vibrations seem to be responsible both for spatial modulation of dipolar couplings at the nuclear larmor frequency and for the excitation of electron spin transitions at the electron larmor frequency .",
    "the existence of a such a broad spectral density of lattice excitations , even at liquid helium t , should not surprise , since solid pa is an organic glass @xcite .",
    "several physical properties of glasses can be described by assuming a local lattice dynamics , namely molecules or atoms can fluctuate among different configurations having very similar energy minima , separated by a barrier @xmath112 . upon increasing @xmath12 the correlation time of these fluctuations can be described by an activated law @xmath113 , with @xmath114 the correlation time in the infinite @xmath12 limit .    for each activation barrier , @xmath11 can be simply described resorting to a spectral density of the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the mean square amplitude of the random fluctuating fields probed by the nuclei in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field . by considering different types of distribution functions @xmath117 for the energy barriers one typically finds a low - t power - law behaviour with @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) .",

    "4.4 , @xmath159 can be quantitatively explained without adjustable parameters in the framework of the tm approach .",
    "still , @xmath160 can not be ascribed to tm , because @xmath0h nuclei are characterized by @xmath7 larger than the electron spin resonance ( esr ) linewidth .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath161 nuclei , @xmath160 should be due exclusively to the modulation of the electron dipolar field at the nucleus caused by the glassy dynamics .",
    "accordingly one can estimate @xmath162 associated with @xmath13 due to radicals , given by @xmath163 , by applying the same approach adopted in the previous subsection 4.2 and taking into account the appropriate magnitude of the hyperfine coupling .",
    "in particular , in the slow motion regime one can write @xcite @xmath164 where s is the electron spin , @xmath165 the electron gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath166 the electron - proton distance . by assuming an average hyperfine field of @xmath167 tesla at the @xmath0h site , very close to the one produced by the other nearby protons , one finds @xmath168 with @xmath169 s@xmath140k@xmath141 and @xmath149 .",

    "this is a clear evidence that indeed the @xmath1c spin ensemble and the electron dipolar reservoirs are strongly coupled in the tm , at least for @xmath182 k. this important observation is further supported by the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath183 , as discussed in the following subsection .    the functional @xmath12 dependence @xmath184 has been ascribed to scattering with the glassy modes , although a sizeable dependence of the @xmath4 magnitude on @xmath8 is also expected from previous investigations @xcite .",
    "even if literature data on @xmath4 measured in different experimental setup and at different fields are partially contradictory @xcite , both the measurements at 1.2 k shown in @xcite and our measurements in the 1.6 - 4.2 k range at higher @xmath8 ( unpublished data ) , consistently evidence a linear dependence @xmath185 for trityl radicals in pa .",
    "thus , electron spin - lattice relaxation in trityl doped pa can be written as @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the term linked to the glassy dynamics and @xmath188 is a phenomenological weakly @xmath12-dependent parameter . according to @xcite @xmath189 for @xmath190 tesla , indicating that for @xmath191 mm the contribution due to dipole - dipole interactions among radicals significantly overcomes the one originated by the scattering with the glassy modes and that @xmath67 should weakly depend on the cooling rate , at variance with nuclear @xmath11 .",
    "overall , from the above considerations a clear scenario emerges . in pa15",
    "the @xmath13 processes show a @xmath12 dependence which is uniquely determined by the properties of the glassy matrix .",
    "on the other hand , the dominant relaxation mechanism for @xmath1c rather involves the coupling of the nuclei to the electron dipolar reservoir through tm .",
    "notably , due to the glassy dynamics which characterizes pa , the magnitude of @xmath29 and @xmath18 and their t dependence can possibly vary among samples containing the same radicals admixed to different molecular substrates or among samples prepared , treated and cooled with different methods , which yield to a different glassy dynamics at low t. the contribution of the glassy modes to the electron spin - lattice relaxation can also justify some variability of @xmath37 data measured by different groups in different conditions @xcite , even if the dominant electron - electron dipolar relaxation mechanism yields to a @xmath67 which scarcely depends on the cooling rate .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fgr : tpol ] a nearly quadratic @xmath12 dependence is found for @xmath1c @xmath76 , the dnp build up rate .",
    "the most recent models describing dnp through tm @xcite have shown how the nuclear polarization under mw irradiation can be deeply influenced by several parameters such as @xmath37 , @xmath192 , the contact time between the nuclear zeeman reservoir and the electron dipolar reservoir , as well as by the dissipative spin diffusion among electrons and the degree of saturation by the mw .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath27 depends on the ratio @xmath193 .",
    "in particular , in presence of nuclear leakage , for @xmath194 ( poor contact between electrons and nuclei ) , polarization levels much lower and @xmath27 values longer than those derived here are expected . on the other hand , for @xmath195 , the polarization should increase and @xmath27 should shorten and depend on @xmath37 . indeed in pa15 @xmath76 has the same @xmath196 dependence of @xmath4 and its order of magnitude matches quantitatively the functional dependence of @xmath197 below 4 k ( dashed curve in fig . [ fgr : t1c - tpol ] ) .",
    "thus , it is tempting to state that a very efficient contact is actually attained . remarkably , below 4",
    "k the ratio @xmath198 behaves as @xmath199 $ ] .",
    "this can happen only if both polarization under mw irradiation and @xmath29 relaxation proceed through the same tm processes .",
    "both the polarization and the relaxation time of pa15 are consistent with the tm regime , whereas the experimental @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fgr : pol ] ) is substantially smaller than the one predicted by the traditional borghini model and a mechanism of dnp - dissipation should be identified .",
    "the dissipation inside the nuclear reservoir via @xmath1c spin - lattice relaxation is expected to be irrelevant because the cooling procedure affects the value of @xmath29 of pa , but not @xmath26 and only weakly @xmath37 , which mainly depends on @xmath8 .",
    "thus the dissipation mechanism does likely affect directly the electron reservoir and can be induced either by a limited microwave power @xcite or by the presence of dissipative processes in the spectral diffusion as discussed in @xcite . at this stage",
    "we can not exclude one of the two mechanisms , or a combination of the two .",
    "our simulations of the rate equation model introduced in @xcite show that the bending behaviour observed in fig .",
    "[ fgr : pol ] is consistent with both mechanisms .",
    "now , the quality of the electron - nucleus contact in pa seemingly evolves on raising @xmath12 up to 4 k. in fact , in fig .",
    "[ fgr : t1c - tpol ] a deviation from the dotted and the dashed curves , tracing the good contact trend , is noted around @xmath200 k for @xmath14 and @xmath76 . both time constants become longer than expected , which likely indicates a substantial degradation of the electron - nucleus contact .",
    "we possibly ascribe the worsening of the electron - nucleus contact on raising @xmath12 to the shortening of @xmath37 .",
    "infact , for @xmath201 k , @xmath37 is around 200 ms , a value close to the effective spin diffusion time @xcite @xmath202 ms , which in turn determines the effective order of magnitude of @xmath192 between the electron dipolar reservoir and the whole nuclear spin ensemble .",
    "then , as explained before , for @xmath12 = 4 k the threshold of the bad contact regime @xmath203 is matched , the polarization bottleneck becomes @xmath192 and @xmath29 and @xmath27 become longer than expected in the good contact scenario . on the other hand",
    ", it should be noted that in the explored @xmath12 range any modulation of electron - nucleus coupling by the glassy dynamics looks definitely ineffective .",
    "infact , since in pa15 the modulation of the electron - nucleus distances occurs over the frequency scales of the glassy dynamics , @xmath204 s@xmath205 s , and considering that the magnitude of the dipolar coupling of the electron spins with the nearby nuclei @xmath206 is such that @xmath207 , the tm mixing process is marginally affected by that dynamics , in agreement with the absence of any effect of the cooling history on the dnp parameters .",
    "definitely one can conclude that in pa15 for @xmath208 k tm occurs in a good contact regime where @xmath209 , while for @xmath210 k a bad contact regime is attained .",
    "the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath26 can be explained as well resorting to tm models combined with dissipative mechanisms located in the electron spin system .",
    "through a series of nuclear spin - lattice relaxation measurements and dnp experiments , both in pure pa and in radical doped pa , it was possible to evidence that several microscopic parameters relevant for the understanding of the dynamical nuclear polarization processes follow the same quadratic @xmath12 dependence .",
    "this trend is interpreted in terms of the glassy dynamics which characterize the pa at low @xmath12 .",
    "notably the @xmath12 dependence of the dnp build up time , of the electron contribution to @xmath14 and of the saturation polarization are found in agreement with the tm regime with a very good thermal contact between the nuclear and the electron non - zeeman reservoirs between 1.6 k and 4 k , where @xmath209 . above 4 k",
    "the tm occurs through a less efficient contact , probably due to the shortening of @xmath37 which becomes of the order of @xmath192 .",
    "definitively , this information gives an interesting feedback to the latest theoretical developments , pointing out the relevance of the electron spin relaxation processes , but more specifically claiming a central role for the lattice excitations in determining the ultimate dnp performances .",
    "the dependence of the experimental results on the cooling method was verified by using two different procedures : _ a _ ) a slow pre - cooling inside a bath cryostat from room @xmath12 to 150 k at -0.5 k / min , followed by a rapid cooling caused by the liquid helium fill ; _ b _ ) a flash freezing of the samples in liquid nitrogen , followed by immersion in liquid helium .",
    "hereafter the first method will be indicated as slow cooling ( sc ) , while the second as fast cooling ( fc ) .",
    "nuclear @xmath11 data showed a different behaviour with respect to the adopted cooling method in both pa and in pa15 ( fig .",
