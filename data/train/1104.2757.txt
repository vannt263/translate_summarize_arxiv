    "experimentally discovered almost eighty years ago @xcite and qualitatively explained thirty years after @xcite , the kondo effect , a minimum in the temperature dependence of the resistance in magnetic alloys , was later anew brought into the world and garbed with physics of quantum dots ( qd ) @xcite . that time this complicated phenomenon was supplemented by physics of nonequilibrium due to the dot coupling to contacts biased by an external voltage . in this setup",
    "the kondo effect , a nonperturbative phenomenon induced by both the electron - electron interactions and the qd - contacts coupling , appears as a sharp many - particle resonance in the tunneling density of states ( tdos ) at the fermi energy .",
    "an immediate consequence of this resonance is the zero - bias maximum observed experimentally in the qd differential conductance at low temperatures .",

    "the field - theoretic approach is based on the slave - boson representation and the keldysh field integral @xcite .",
    "importantly , our theory is nonperturbative in both the electron - electron interaction and qd - contacts coupling .",
    "the necessity in such a theory is obvious from its advantages .",
    "firstly , it is a field theory and , thus , it has a clear systematic generalization from the present relatively simple basic model to more involved setups such as the ones with ferromagnetic contacts , superconducting contacts , finite @xmath1 systems , etc .",
    "this is especially important since there is a limited number of analytical theories nonperturbative in both the electron - electron interaction and qd - contacts coupling and which at the same time have a straightforward generalization scheme .",

    "so far , using the slave - boson method in the context of qds , the results were obtained nonperturbatively numerically @xcite below and/or above @xmath2 , perturbatively semi - analytically @xcite above @xmath2 and nonperturbatively analytically @xcite below @xmath2 .",

    "our goal is the development of an analytical ground for the slave - bosonic nonperturbative field theories which could be placed within the blue ( uppermost ) class in fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] . to avoid problems with high temperatures",
    "we do not use the integral trick to take into account the restriction of the hilbert space but instead use an alternative method based on taking a certain limit with respect to a real parameter @xcite .",
    "this alternative method has not been applied so far in conjunction with the keldysh field integral .",
    "we demonstrate that the corresponding limit can be exactly performed analytically after the keldysh field integral for the tdos has been analytically calculated using a certain approximation .",
    "specifically , the approximation concerns the effective keldysh action obtained after integrating out all electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this action being a nonlinear functional of the slave - bosonic field is expanded up to second order in this field .",
    "note , that this does not imply any perturbation since the action itself is the argument of an exponent .",
    "according to the general concept of the condensed matter field theory @xcite the physics of our model is the physics in the vicinity of the zero slave - bosonic field configuration .",
    "we demonstrate that this physics contains the kondo effect in qds at finite temperatures .",
    "this scenario complements @xcite the saddle point analysis @xcite valid deep below the mean field theory slave - bosonic phase transition , i.e. , at low temperatures when the slave - bosonic field in the mean field theory is condensed .",
    "surprisingly , our simple or `` bare '' theory , which might play a role of a nonperturbative `` free propagator '' for more advanced nonperturbative theories of the blue class in fig .

    "[ figure_7 ] and additionally proves that our keldysh field theory , within its applicability range , correctly describes the kondo physics in qds .",

    "the circles show the result obtained from our field theory.,width=7 ]    finally , we would like to say a few words about the numerical consistency of our theory . to do this ,",
    "we employ the sum rule given by eq .",
    "( 39 ) of ref . .",
    "in nca this sum rule is always satisfied within 0.5% . in our theory",
    "this depends on how well the applicability criteria , eq .",
    "( [ criteria ] ) , of the keldysh field theory are satisfied . for example , for the parameters presented in fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] the sum rule is satisfied within 15% while for @xmath116 it is 8.5% and for @xmath117 it is 4.4% .",
    "one should note that the sum rule is an integral estimate over the whole energy range .",
    "thus , the error is gained over the whole range of energies . at the same time for",
    "a given energy the qd tdos may have higher accuracy .",
    "since the only approximation was the truncation of all the terms of higher orders than the terms quadratic in the slave - bosonic field , to improve the consistency of the method and extend its applicability criteria one should go beyond the quadratic approximation and this will be done in a subsequent study .",
    "we have developed a basic slave - boson nonperturbative keldysh field theory for the kondo effect in quantum dots .",
    "the theory deals with the physics in the vicinity of the zero slave - bosonic field configuration where , as we have shown , the main fraction of the kondo physics is located at experimentally relevant temperatures .",
    "the presented theory has a closed analytical solution for the quantum dot tunneling density of states and , despite being relatively simple , properly describes experimental data on the kondo peak observed in the differential conductance , correctly predicts the kondo temperature and , within its applicability range , has the same universal temperature dependence of the conductance as the one obtained in numerical renormalization group calculations .",
    "therefore , it represents a convenient basis , as a free nonperturbative propagator , for more advanced theories which could extend the applicability of our approach to larger values of the slave - bosonic amplitude and , thus , to temperatures much lower than the kondo temperature .",
