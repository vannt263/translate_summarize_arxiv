    "in a recent work @xcite , casati and prosen have shown an interesting numerical simulation concerning the quantum - mechanical time - evolution of an initial gaussian wave packet inside a billiard domain having the following shapes :    isosceles right triangle    as above but with the hypotenuse replaced by a circular arc . in both cases",
    "the domain has two narrow slits on a cathetus , through which the initial wave packet leaks out bit by bit . the set - up of the experiment is intriguing , because it involves properties of classical dynamics and properties of quantum dynamics .",
    "the former are represented by the shapes of the billiards , where the classical ray dynamics can be regular ( case @xmath0 or fully chaotic ( case @xmath1 ) , whereas the latter are represented by the interference of the two wave packets coming out from the slits .",
    "the experiment gives thus the opportunity to investigate two questions which , although debated for a long time , still remain far from being fully understood , i.e. the manifestations of classical chaos in quantum mechanics ( quantum chaos ) @xcite and whether an external decoherence mechanism is necessary in order that a system presents the quantum to classical transition @xcite .",
    "the result in @xcite is that interferences fringes occur only in the case of the integrable billiard @xmath0 .",
    "casati and prosen have drawn thus the conclusion that their experiment shows :    `` a vivid and fundamental illustration of the manifestation of classical chaos in quantum mechanics '' +   + and that    `` considering a pure quantum state in absence of any external decoherence mechanism , internal dynamical chaos can provide the required randomization to ensure quantum to classical transition in the semiclassical region '' .",
    "an investigation similar to @xcite has been carried out @xcite in an aharonov - bohm two - slit set - up by a semiclassical calculation of the outgoing probability density current .",
    "this further investigation substantially confirms the fact that the occurrence of interference fringes depends on the billiard integrability but it is critical of conclusion @xmath2 .",
    "impressed by the conclusions @xmath3 and @xmath2 , in the present paper we report on a numerical simulation similar to that in @xcite but concerning a much larger family of billiards .",
    "a billiard @xmath4 ( in fig . 1 represented by a square ) is set inside a rectangular integration region @xmath5 .",
    "the borders of @xmath4 are defined by a thin potential barrier @xmath6 , sufficiently high to reduce as much as possible the tunnel effect .",
    "two slits @xmath7 and @xmath8 on the lower side @xmath9 of @xmath4 are obtained setting @xmath10 along two small intervals of @xmath9 .",
    "the numerical simulation consists in the integration of the cauchy initial value problem for the schrdinger equation are used throughout the paper . ] \\ {      . where h=-+ v_b , and @xmath11 is the normalized gaussian wave packet _ 0(x , y)=(2_0 ^ 2)^-1/2e^i(k_xx+k_yy)e^-[(x - x_0)^2+(y - y_0)^2]/4_0 ^ 2 .",
    "the intensity @xmath12 on the screen @xmath13 at @xmath14 , i.e. the probability density gone across the point @xmath14 of @xmath13 during the experiment , is then evaluated by i(x)= _ 0^tj_y(x,|y;t)dt , where @xmath15 is the duration of the experiment ,",
    "@xmath16 the component along the @xmath17-axis of the probability density current and @xmath18 the position of the screen .",
    "the integration of the problem ( 1 ) has been carried out through the evaluation of the time - evolution operator @xmath19 by a finite difference method , where @xmath19 has been approximated by the exponential series truncated at the fourth order .",
    "the order of this truncation is crucial for the accuracy of the method .",
    "indeed , the truncation at the first order employed in previous papers gives rise to serious problems of stability and probability conservation ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . strictly speaking the integration region of ( 1 )",
    "is the whole space @xmath20 , but in our calculations we have reduced this space to the finite rectangular region @xmath5 .",
    "this reduction causes reflections from the border of @xmath5 . in order to avoid this problem ,",
    "we have employed the same methods in @xcite , that is damping the wave function by means of an imaginary potential @xmath21 , where @xmath22 inside an `` absorbing layer '' @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) along the border of @xmath5 and zero elsewhere . the integration of ( 1 ) with this method turns out to be very accurate : the total probability is conserved and the transmission through the boundary of @xmath4 and the reflection from the sides of @xmath5 are negligible .",
    "it should be observed that a way alternative to ( 1 ) to descrive the time development of @xmath11 is that of considering a cauchy initial value problem like ( 1 ) , but relative to the free - hamiltonian @xmath24 , with in addition the boundary condition @xmath25 , on the border of @xmath4 .",
    "the method ( 1 ) , employed in the present paper , has a twofold advantage .",
    "the first one is of a formal nature .",
    "whatever the billiard shape may be , the description of the time - evolution of @xmath11 is given by the problem ( 1 ) , which is defined in the whole space @xmath20 and presents a hamiltonian operator which is _ always _ ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 182 ) self - adjoint in the space @xmath26 . on the contrary ,",
    "in the other method one should prove the self - adjointness of @xmath24 in each billiard domain with the boundary condition @xmath27 on its border .",
    "the second advantage of the method ( 1 ) is of a practical nature : one can handle any billiard shape without any difficulty .",
    "indeed , there is no need to impose each time the tiresome boundary condition @xmath27 on the border of the billiard and all that changes with the billiard shape is only the expression for @xmath6 in ( 1 ) .",
    "+     height and @xmath28 length of the rectangular integration region , @xmath23 absorbing layer , @xmath4 billiard , @xmath9 lower side of @xmath4 , @xmath29 origin of the coordinate system , @xmath7 and @xmath8 slits , @xmath13 screen , @xmath30 gaussian wave packet ( 3 ) , @xmath31 wave vector of @xmath30 . ]       finally , we show the case @xmath32 where , although the @xmath33 is broken to a high degree coincides with the billiard @xmath34 in fig .",
    "2 . ] , the intensity plot , limited to the integration time @xmath35 $ ] , reproduces a perfect interference pattern .",
    "this fact is not a peculiarity of the billiard @xmath32 , but it happens similarly for any billiard , whatever the degree of the @xmath33 violation may be .",
    "its analysis illustrates in a way particularly instructive that the causes of the perturbation of the interference fringes are the previous discussed asymmetries of the initial conditions and of the hamiltonian in the problem ( 1 ) .",
    "indeed , during the first impact of the wave packet @xmath36 solution of ( 1 ) with the lower side @xmath9 of the billiard ( impact which lasts roughly @xmath37 ) , the slits radiate two coherent wave packets @xmath38 ( see the plot of the phase difference in column iii of fig .",
    "5 ) , because the time - evolution of @xmath36 is not yet under the influence of the effects due to the direction of @xmath39 and to the asymmetry in the billiard shape . consequently , the wave fronts of @xmath36 are basically the same as those in the initial gaussian wave packet ( 3 ) , i.e. straight lines parallel to @xmath9 . in the time interval",
    "@xmath40 $ ] , the wave packet gets to the side of the billiard opposite to @xmath9 and then it goes back to impinge again upon @xmath9 .",
    "the slits radiates for the second time , but now the effects of the @xmath33 violation are evident : the coherence between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is lost ( see again the plot of the phase difference in column iii of fig .",
    "however , the probability emitted during this second radiation takes about @xmath43 to reach the screen .",
    "thus , the perfect interference pattern in fig .",
    "5 corresponds to the probability piled up on the screen during the first radiation .",
    "this pattern then , as our calculations show , begins changing progressively in proportion to the the effects of the @xmath33 violation from @xmath44 on .",
    "+ taking up the discussion on the results in figs . 2 , 4",
    ", we can see that in the cases @xmath45 , the effects of the @xmath33 breaking do not seem to be strong enough to lead to a complete decoherence of the wave packets @xmath41 and @xmath42 , whereas they do in the cases @xmath46 .",
    "we illustrate this latter situation in fig .",
    "6 , where we have approximated the intensity plots due to two incoherent waves @xmath47 with the plots sum of the intensity patterns relative to two one - slit experiments obtained from the original two - slit set - up by closing alternatively the slits @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it should be recalled that we have stopped our calculations when the probability density remained inside the billiards is of order @xmath48 per cent .",
    "the further emission of this residual probability density could change , in some detail , the intensity patterns .",
    "however , we do not think it probable because the shapes of the intensity patterns shown in our figures are practically the same as those found when the probability leaked out from the slits was of order @xmath49 per cent . + as regards the important conclusion @xmath2 in @xcite , concerning the question whether a coupling with external degrees of freedom is necessary or not in order that the quantal evolution is replaced by the classical one , our results show clearly that this coupling is not necessary . in this sense",
    "they support the theory of the `` dynamical decoherence '' proposed in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , our results suggest a crucial difference about the cause of this decoherence . indeed , as we have seen , the wave packets @xmath41 and @xmath42 radiated from the slits become incoherent not in virtue of properties depending on classical chaos but only in virtue of specific properties of the quantum - mechanical time - evolution .",
    "these properties are direct consequences of the violation of the @xmath33 ( 6 ) .",
    "we can also say that our results show examples where the decoherence in a quantum system happens in virtue of properties which , besides being internal to the system , are fully of quantum nature . + in conclusion , we have shown that in the class of the numerical experiments of interference considered in @xcite and in the present paper , classical chaos does not seem to have any role .",
    "the explanation of the results is indeed quite quantal : each result is determined in our experimental set - up by the degree of violation of the spatial - reflection symmetry w.r.t . to the @xmath17-axis of the quantum - mechanical time - evolution inside the billiard .",
    "this symmetry violation , in turn , is determined by the analogous symmetry violations of the billiard shape and of the initial gaussian wave packet .",
    "contrarily to the literature , our explanation of results is thus , in last analysis , of a geometric kind and it does not depend on the semiclassical nature of the system . in our numerical simulation",
    "we have used the semiclassical value @xmath50 just for intentional conformity to the work @xcite , but if our simulation were repeated with not semiclassical values of @xmath51 ( of course employing an experimental set - up modified suitably in order to have a good visibility of the fringes ) we expect that one would find out results quite analogous with those shown in the present paper .",
