    "the persistence problem is concerned with the fraction of space which persists in its initial @xmath2 state up to some later time @xmath0 .",
    "the problem has been extensively studied over the past decade for pure spin systems at both zero [ 1 - 4 ] and non - zero [ 5 ] temperatures .",
    "typically , in the non - equilibrium dynamics of spin systems at zero - temperature , the system is prepared initially in a random state and the fraction of spins , @xmath3 , that persists in the same state as at @xmath4 up to some later time @xmath0 is studied . for the pure ferromagnetic ising model on a square lattice",
    "the persistence probability has been found to decay algebraically [ 1 - 4 ] @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the non - trivial persistence exponent [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "derrida et al [ 4 ] have shown analytically that for the pure 1d ising model @xmath7 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath8 depends on both the spin [ 6 ] and spatial [ 3 ] dimensionalities ; see ray [ 7 ] for a recent review . at criticality",
    "[ 5 ] , consideration of the global order parameter leads to a value of @xmath9 for the pure two - dimensional ising model .",
    "it has been only fairly recently established that systems containing disorder [ 8 - 10 ] exhibit different persistence behaviour to that of pure systems .",
    "a key finding [ 8 - 9,11 ] is the appearance of blocking  regardless of the amount of disorder present in the system .",
    "blocked  spins are effectively isolated from the behaviour of the rest of the system in the sense that they _ never _ flip . as a result , @xmath10 and",
    "the key quantity of interest is the residual persistence given by @xmath11 note that for the five dimensional pure ising model without any disorder blocking has also been observed at @xmath12 [ 3 ] . at finite temperature",
    "there is no evidence of blocking [ 12 ] . as well as theoretical models",
    ", the persistence phenomenon has also been studied in a wide range of experimental systems and the value of @xmath8 ranges from @xmath13 to @xmath14 [ 13 - 15 ] , depending on the system .",
    "a considerable amount of the recent theoretical effort has gone into obtaining numerical estimates of @xmath8 for different models [ 1 - 11 ] .",
    "recently , it has been found that the behaviour of the random ising ferromagnet at zero temperature on a voronoi - delaunay lattice [ 16 ] is very similar to the behaviour on the diluted ferromagnetic square lattice [ 8,9 ] .    in this work",
    "we add to the knowledge and understanding regarding persistence by presenting the simulation results for the behaviour of a recently proposed spin model which appears to reproduce the intermittency observed in real financial markets [ 17 ] . in the next section",
    "we discuss the model in detail .",
    "in section iii we give an outline of the method used and the values of the various parameters employed .",
    "section iv describes the results and the consequent implications for using the model in a financial or social context . finally , in section v there is a brief conclusion .",
    "yamano [ 16 ] has proposed a minimalist  version of the bornholdt model [ 18 ] .",
    "we study the persistence phenomenon in the former . in this model",
    "one has @xmath15 market traders , denoted by ising spins @xmath16 , located on the sites of a hypercubic lattice , @xmath17 .",
    "the action of the @xmath18 trader of buying or selling a share of a traded stock or commodity at time step @xmath0 corresponds to the spin variable @xmath19 assuming the value @xmath20 or @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "hence , at each time step , a given trader will be either buying or selling .",
    "a local field , @xmath22 , determines the dynamics of the spins and , hence , the action of the trader .",
    "we follow [ 16 ] and assume that @xmath23 where the first summation runs over the nearest neighbours of @xmath24 only , @xmath25 is a parameter coupling to the absolute magnetization .",
    "the nearest neighbour interactions are selected randomly from @xmath26 where @xmath1 is the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds .",
    "the case @xmath27 corresponds to the @xmath28 edwards - anderson spin - glass [ 11 ] .",
    "each agent is updated according to the following heat bath dynamics :    @xmath29^{-1}$,}\\\\ -1 & \\quad \\mbox{with $ 1-q$,}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",

    "the first term on the right hand side in equation ( 3 ) contains the influence of the neighbours and the second term reflects the external environment .",
    "the balance between the two terms determines whether an agent buys or sells . if @xmath32 , the agent is equally likely to buy or sell as @xmath33 . if , however , @xmath34 , then @xmath35 and agent @xmath24 is more likely to buy than sell . similarly , if @xmath36 , then we have @xmath37 and the agent is more likely to sell than buy . @xmath38 and @xmath31 are tunable parameters in our model . the values we select for",
    "these are determined by the requirement that the model should be able to reproduce , at least qualitatively , some aspect of actual behaviour observed in a real market . in this model",
    "the return is defined in terms of the logarithm of the absolute value of the magnetization , @xmath39 , that is @xmath40 a key stylised fact observed in real financial markets is the intermittent or bursty  behaviour in the returns [ 19 ] .",
    "simulations [ 16 ] in spatial dimensions ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 confirm that the above model is able to reproduce the required intermittent behaviour in the returns ; see , for example , figure 1 in yamano [ 16 ] .",
    "it should be emphasised that intermittency is only observed for certain values of the tunable parameters , @xmath38 and @xmath31 .",
    "the temperature , @xmath43 , is defined as the temperature at which intermittency is observed in the returns .",
    "although @xmath44 for all dimensions considered , @xmath43 depending on both @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the values of @xmath43 as determined in [ 16 ] were : @xmath47 .",
    "a couple of points should be emphasised at this stage .",
    "simulations are performed only on hypercubic lattices where the linear dimension @xmath46 is an odd value .",
    "this requirement ensures that the right hand side of equation ( 6 ) is well defined .",
    "the simulations discussed in the present work were performed in spatial dimensions ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath48 . for each value of @xmath45 , we fine tune the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath43 so that intermittent behaviour is observed in the returns as discussed above .",
    "we found that although @xmath49 in all cases , the value of @xmath43 depends on @xmath45 ( and also on @xmath46 ) at which intermittency is observed .",
    "our values for @xmath46 and @xmath43 are listed in table 1 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath43 for @xmath50 are consistent with those in [ 16 ] but not identical because of finite - size effects . in our interpretation of the model ,",
    "a persistent trader is one who does nt change his action during the course of the simulation .",
    "hence , we are interested in studying the fraction of traders who have been at time @xmath0 either buying or selling continuously since @xmath4 . later , we will also suggest a possible interpretation within the context of sociophysics of the model .",
    ".values of the linear dimension @xmath46 of the lattices used in the simulations .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath51 in all cases .",
    "intermittent behaviour was observed in the returns when the temperature was set at @xmath43 as given above .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as mentioned in the previous section , for each spatial dimension @xmath45 we first fine tune the temperature to reproduce intermittent behaviour in the returns .",
    "as can be seen from table 1 , the temperature @xmath52 decreases with @xmath45 . for a given dimension ,",
    "all subsequent simulations are performed at that temperature .",
    "averages over at least 100 samples for each run were performed and the error - bars in the following plots are smaller than the data points .    the value of each agent at @xmath4 is noted and the dynamics updated according to equation ( 3 ) . at each time step , we count the number of agents that still persist in their initial @xmath2 state by evaluating @xmath53 initially , @xmath54 for all @xmath24 .",
    "it changes to zero when an agent changes from buying to selling or vice vera for the first time .",
    "note that once @xmath55 , it remains so for all subsequent calculations .",
    "the total number , @xmath56 , of agents who have not changed their action by time @xmath0 is then given by @xmath57 a fundamental quantity of interest is @xmath3 , the persistence probability . in this problem",
    "we can identify @xmath3 with the density of agents continuously buying or selling without interruption since the start [ 1 ] , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total number of agents present .",
    "we now discuss our results . we restrict ourselves to @xmath60 as the problem is symmetric about @xmath61 .",
    "it should be noted that we tried various different fits ( exponential , power - law , stretched - exponential , etc . ) for our data .",
    "we will not discuss the fits we discarded as unsatisfactory .    in figure 1",
    "we show a semi - log plot of the persistence probability against time @xmath0 for a range of bond concentrations @xmath62 for @xmath41 .",
    "its clear from the plot that the data can be fitted to @xmath63 where we estimate @xmath64 from the linear fit .",
    "note that @xmath65 , independently of @xmath1 .     versus @xmath0 for @xmath41 over the range @xmath66 .",
    "the straight line , which is a guide to the eye , has a slope of @xmath67 . ]",
    "figure 2 displays the results for @xmath68 .",
    "although , just as for @xmath41 , there is evidence for exponential decay , this time it would appear that the value of the parameter @xmath69 depends on @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath70 we estimate @xmath71 .    .",
    "we see that here , in contrast to figure 1 for @xmath41 , the slopes are dependent on the bond concentrations .",
    "the linear fit shown is that for @xmath70 and the slope is @xmath72 . ]",
    "the results for the three - dimensional case are shown in figure 3 . here",
    "we see clear evidence that even the qualitative nature of the decay depends on the bond concentration . for @xmath61",
    "we have behaviour very similar to the two cases considered earlier , namely exponential decay .",
    "the decay is clearly non - exponential for @xmath70 over the interval considered .",
    "a fit to the stretched - exponential is also unsatisfactory even though we have an additional adjustable parameter .     against @xmath0 for @xmath42 for the same bond concentrations as earlier .",
    "the straight line , which is a guide to the eye , has a slope of @xmath73 and indicates that the decay for @xmath61 is very similar to that found in lower dimensions .",
    "the behaviour for @xmath70 is clearly non - exponential . ]",
    "the results in @xmath74 are very similar to those for @xmath42 and we will not present them here . instead , in figure 4 we show a log - log plot of the persistence against time for @xmath48 .",
    "the decay of @xmath3 is seen to be heavily dependent on the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds . for low values of @xmath75 ) , we have a power - law decay at long times as given by equation ( 1 ) with an estimated value of @xmath76 . for higher value of @xmath1",
    "the decay would appear not to be a power - law but also not exponential in its nature .",
    "we note that even though we are working with a model containing disorder , no blocking  is observed in the simulations .",
    "this is probably because we are working at a finite temperature and is in agreement with the earlier work on the pure ising model in high dimensions [ 3,12 ] .     and",
    "selected bond concentrations as a log - log plot . clearly , the behaviour depends crucially on the value of @xmath1 . for low ( @xmath77 ) values",
    "the decay is power - law .",
    "the straight line shown has a slope of @xmath78 . ]",
    "to conclude , we have presented the results of extensive simulations for the persistence behaviour of agents in a model capturing some of the features found in real financial markets .",
    "although the model contains bond disorder , we do not find any evidence of blocking  .",
    "this is believed to be because of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the persistence behaviour appears to depend on both the spatial dimensionality and the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds . generally , whereas in low dimensions the decay is exponential , for higher dimensions and low values of @xmath1 we get power - law behaviour .",
    "the initial model was developed in an economic context .",
    "power law persistence in this case means the existence of traders who keep on buying or selling for long durations .",
    "furthermore , the presence of blocking  would be highly unrealistic for modelling the dynamics because the traders would have access to only a finite amount of capital .",
    "hence , the absence of blocking would suggest that our model is not an unreasonable starting point for further development .",
    "one can also interpret the model in a social context . here",
    "the value @xmath79 or @xmath21 could represent an opinion .",
    "here blocking  would be realistic and correspond to the proportion of the population that is stubborn and not susceptible to a change .",
    "hence , any model exhibiting exponential decay in the persistence probability would probably be an unrealistic model to use in this scenario .",
    "hence , we can use the behaviour of the persistence probability as a criterion to decide whether we have a realistic economic or social model .",
