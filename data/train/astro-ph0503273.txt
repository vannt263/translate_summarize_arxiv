    "thick and thin disk stars are chemically well separated ( e.g. @xcite , hereafter bfli ) , with thick disk stars having notably higher @xmath0-elements , with a ratio of @xmath0/fe for given fe content systematically higher than thin disk stars .",
    "there is at most only a very weak gradient in metallicity with height above the plane in the thick disk @xcite , in fact bfli found that abundance trends appear to be invariant with vertical height .",
    "thick disks have now been shown to be prevalent in disk galaxies ( dalcanton & bernstein 2002 , hereafter db02 ) .",
    "surface photometry of a sample of 47 edge - on disk galaxies in db02 also showed that extragalactic thick disks are red . the next step in studying extragalactic thick disks",
    "was recently taken by mould ( 2005 , hereafter m05 ) , who resolved the stellar population of a nearby sample of edge - on disk galaxies , to reveal the properties as a function of height above the plane .",
    "all four galaxies of the m05 sample have thick disks composed of red stellar populations . the gradient of color with height , @xmath3 is almost zero , or slightly positive . from the color magnitude diagram ( cmd )",
    "analysis , m05 concludes that the thick disks consist of old and relatively metal rich populations , and their stellar population is independent of height .",
    "a study of the stellar content of ngc 55 by davidge ( 2005 , hereafter d05 ) similarly finds that stars associated with the thick disk are old ( ages @xmath4 ) , with the majority being in the metallicity range @xmath5}<-0.7 $ ] .",
    "a further recent study by @xcite also find evidence for thick disks in the three nearby spiral galaxies for which they analyse agb and rgb stars .",

    "this was evidenced by the velocity dispersion versus age relation for stars around solar radii , which showed an abrupt increase in velocity dispersion at lookback time of @xmath6 , in excellent agreement with observation . by examining and comparing these simulations with observations",
    ", we proposed that thick disks form from gas which is accreted during a chaotic period of hierarchical clustering of gas rich `` building blocks '' at high redshift ( bkgf ) .",

    "comparison is also made with the studies of extragalactic thick disks in db02 and d05 .",
    "further , we examine the abundance ratio of @xmath0-elements with respect to iron in the stellar populations of the thin and thick disks , as well as halos of our sgals . these will provide further important tests of our thick disk formation scenario , and tie in to current studies on the formation of the stellar halo component of disk galaxies .",
    "our simulated galaxies ( sgals ) are formed using our galactic chemodynamical evolution code , gcd+ .",
    "this n - body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code self - consistently follows the effects of gravity , gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and star formation .",
    "gcd+ also takes into account metal enrichment and energy released by both type  ii ( sne  ii ) and type  ia ( sne  ia ) supernovae , as well as the metal enrichment from intermediate mass stars .",
    "full details of gcd+ can be found in @xcite .",
    "we apply the _ adiabatic feedback model _ described in @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the gas within the sph smoothing kernel of sne ii explosions is in adiabatic phase , in a fashion similar to a model presented in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to form late - type sgals which each have a dominant disk component , and a less massive , relatively metal poor halo component @xcite .",
    "we employ here a semi - cosmological version of gcd+ based upon the galaxy formation model of @xcite .",
    "the initial condition is an isolated sphere which consists of dark matter and gas and whose total mass is @xmath7 .",
    "this top - hat overdensity has an amplitude , @xmath8 , at initial redshift , @xmath9 , which is approximately related to the collapse redshift , @xmath10 , by @xmath11    ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "small scale density fluctuations are superimposed on each sphere , parameterized by @xmath12 .",
    "these perturbations are the seeds for local collapse and subsequent star formation . to incorporate the effects of longer wavelength fluctuations , a solid - body rotation corresponding to a spin parameter , @xmath13 , is imparted to the initial sphere .",

    "the random seeds are deliberately chosen to ensure no major merger occurs in late epochs ( @xmath211 ) .",

    "each has a dominant young , metal rich thin disk .",
    "the stellar halo components are old and metal poor .",
    "the surface density profiles of disk component for all four sgals are reasonably well fitted by exponentials .",
    "evidence that our four sgals have thick disk components is provided by the velocity dispersion - age relation .",

    "the solar neighborhood in sgals is defined as an annulus bounded by @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the radius in the disk plane .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion - age relation for solar neighborhood stars are also shown as triangles with error bars , as read from figure  3 of @xcite , who use the data of @xcite .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion is relatively constant for the past @xmath29 , but shows an abrupt increase at @xmath30 ago .",
    "the older stars with high velocity dispersion are recognized as thick disk stars .",
    "the velocity dispersion for the four sgals show qualitatively very similar behavior , with plateaus interrupted by abrupt increases of velocity dispersion , at lookback times of between 8 and 10 gyrs .",
    "the implication is that each of our sgals also has an old thick disk component . in sgal1 and sgal2 ,",
    "these abrupt increases are more recent , at @xmath318 grys ago , compared with sgal3 and sgal4 , whose jump in velocity dispersion occurred closer to 10 grys ago .",
    "the differences in the lookback time of these increases in velocity dispersion in our sgals is partly related to the differences in collapse redshift , @xmath10 , in our initial conditions .",
    "we use the timing of these increases in velocity dispersion of our sgals as a pointer to the thick disk formation era of each simulation . in figures",
    "[ f3a]-[f3d ] , we plot four snapshots at different time - steps in the evolution of our sgals during these thick disk formation epochs . in each sgal , these epochs are defined by multiple mergers of gas rich galactic building blocks .",
    "the first panel in each plot shows a number of `` building blocks '' , and it is clear that these are gas rich . as is detailed in bkgf , we confirmed that the gas mass to stellar mass ratio within these building blocks is high at this epoch . a turbulent period of mergers then ensues . at this time , gas which carries significant angular momentum ends up a disk structure .",
    "however , the gaseous disk is kinematically heated up by these perturbations of merging building - blocks , and has high - velocity dispersion .",
    "consequently the stars born in the disk at this period have high - velocity dispersion , and are subsequently identified as thick disk stars .",
    "this epoch is also characterized by rapid star formation . global star formation rate ( sfr ) as a function of lookback time for the sgals is plotted in figure  [ sfr ] .",
    "the thick disk formation epoch shown in figures  [ f3a]-[f3d ] corresponds closely to the peak of sfr .",
    "the peak of sfr for sgal1 and sgal2 is later than that for sgal3 and sgal4 , corresponding to the earlier thick disk formation epoch in sgal3 and sgal4 , as reflected in figure  [ sigw ] and figures  [ f3a]-[f3d ] . by the end of the thick disk formation epoch ,",
    "the thin disk component starts to be built up ( see bkgf for more details ) .",
    "following bkgf , we identify disk stars which form in this epoch as thick disk stars .",
    "thus , we refer to disk star particles forming in the period highlighted in figures  [ f3a]-[f3d ] as thick disk stars .",
    "the age range for the definition of the thick disk is summarized in table  [ modp ] .",
    "we arbitrarily decided this age range , based on velocity dispersion ( fig .",
    "[ sigw ] ) , snapshots ( figs .  [ f3a]-[f3d ] ) , and star formation rates ( fig .",
    "[ sfr ] ) .",
    "we confirmed that the results shown in this paper are not sensitive to modest changes in these age definitions .",
    "an additional criterion , applied to extract disk stars , is a rotational velocity of greater than @xmath32 , which eradicates halo stars which form in the period that the thick disk is built up .",
    "we confirm that the properties of the thick disk stars identified are similar to those observed in the thick disk of the milky way ( see bkgf for more details ) .",
    "the rotation velocity of thick disk lags that of thin disk stars by @xmath33 .",
    "we derive thick disk scale - heights of 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.1 , and 1.4 kpc for sgal1 - 4 respectively , compared to the thin disk scale - heights of 0.52 , 0.55 , 0.6 and 0.45 kpc .",
    "the thick disk stars are uniformly old , as expected by its definition",
    ". we will demonstrate below that the thick stars in sgals also have characteristic metallicities observed in the milky way and external disk galaxies .",
    "the key questions of the current study of sgals are the variation in the metallicities , age , and hence colors of thick disk stars as a function of the distance from the disk plane , i.e. height ( @xmath34 ) , as well as how their abundance ratios differ from later forming thin disk stars .",
    "figure  [ gradmet ] displays the mean iron abundance , which we call metallicity hereafter , of thick disk stars , as a function of @xmath35z@xmath35 .",
    "thick disk stars of sgal1 , sgal2 and sgal4 have metallicities in the range of @xmath36}\\rangle$ ] between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , closely resembling the thick disk of the milky way , while thick disk stars of sgal3 have a significantly lower metallicity , @xmath36}\\rangle\\sim-0.8 $ ] .",
    "this may be related to the fact that the thick disk of sgal4 is significantly less massive than the other sgals .",
    "however , to examine this , we need a statistically significant sample , and thus we are now trying to increase the number of sgals ( renda et al",
    "the important thing is that very little gradient is present in figure  [ gradmet ] for the thick disk star particles of any sgal .",
    "figure  [ gradage ] demonstrates the age of the thick disk star particles against @xmath35z@xmath35 . little trend of age with height can be said to exist .",
    "this is not trivial , because the age range for the definition of the age of the thick disk is wide enough to have more significant age gradient .",
    "it looks a little odd that sgal4 thick disk stars are older on average than those of sgal3 , seemingly contrary to the time of the epoch given in table  [ modp ] .",
    "the is due to the sharper downturn in sfr in sgal4 , as seen in figure  [ sfr ] , which means that a larger fraction of thick disk stars in sgal4 were born at the early time of the thick disk formation epoch , compared with sgal3 .    as a result of a lack of significant gradient in neither age nor metallicity with height , the thick disk star particles have no real color gradient .",
    "figure  [ vi ] shows the mean @xmath39 color as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "here we derive the mean @xmath39 color for the giant branch stars ( rgb / agb ) of thick disk populations of the sgals .",
    "padova isochrones @xcite are used to derive the colors .",
    "we obtain the isochrone of the average age and metallicities seen in figures  [ gradmet ] and [ gradage ] with linear interpolations are taken between the ages and metallicities provided by the padova tables",
    ". then the @xmath39 colors are derived by taking the initial mass function ( imf ) weighted mean of the isochrone within the range of @xmath41 , which corresponds to the luminosity range applied in m05 .",
    "the red colors of the giant branch stars reflects the age and metallicity of the thick disk populations , and there is no color gradient .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the colors , and lack of color gradient , as observed in m05 .",
    "figure  [ brrk ] shows the @xmath42 and @xmath43 , colors of our thick disk stars . here",
    "the colors are derived from the integration of the luminosity of all thick disk stars which are still alive at the end of the simulations ( redshift zero ) .",
    "again , padova isochrones are used to derive the colors .",
    "we see that these colors are relatively constant with height , at @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "these colors allow direct comparison with figures  3 and 6 of db02 . away from the plane ,",
    "db02 find a relatively narrow range of colors , with @xmath46 1.0 - 1.4 and @xmath47 .",
    "in this study we do not examine sgals with the same mass range as the 47 galaxies studied in db02 , but rather examine only @xmath48 sgals .",
    "nevertheless , thick disks of the sgals have colors which can explain the stellar populations observed in db02 to envelope edge - on disk galaxies , which they interpret as thick disk components .",
    "we next compare the abundance ratios of @xmath0-elements with respect to iron for different sgal components , thin disk , thick disk and stellar halo . in order to best",
    "compare with observations , we look at star particles within the  solar neighborhood \" , as defined above .",
    "thin disk stars are defined as stars younger than 7 gyr and rotating faster than @xmath32 .",
    "the halo stars are represented by retrograde stars which formed before the end of the thick disk formation epoch as defined in table  1 .",
    "note that the stars which have already formed in the building blocks which subsequently merge during thick disk formation have a strong tendency toward ending up in the halo ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0-element abundances of the three components are plotted in figures  [ alpha1]-[alpha4 ] .",
    "abundances of oxygen and magnesium are used to define our @xmath0-elements .",
    "the spread of the distributions in the [ fe / h ] axis is taken to include approximately 90% of stars within each component .",
    "it is evident that in all four sgals , thick disk stars have higher @xmath0-element abundances than thin disk stars , even where they overlap in metallicity , [ fe / h ] .",
    "these thick disk abundances are characteristic of dominant enrichment from sne  ii .",
    "these results match very nicely with recent observations , ( e.g. @xcite ; bfli ) .",
    "uncertainty in our models must be noted here , regarding star formation prescriptions , nucleosynthesis yields , and particularly sne  ia time - scales , which are still little understood theoretically .",
    "it is , however , very encouraging that the overall trends of the difference in abundance patterns between thin and thick disk in the milky way can be reproduced with our thick disk formation scenario .",
    "halo stars in our sgals also have high @xmath0-element abundances . as shown in @xcite , stars in the gas rich building blocks will preferentially accrete to the halo .",
    "those formed in building blocks accreted at high redshift will have been enriched primarily by sne  ii .",
    "halo stars tend to have slightly higher [ @xmath0/fe ] than thick disk stars .",
    "this seems to be because sne  ii yields from higher mass stars have higher [ @xmath0/fe ] @xcite .",
    "the thin disk stars , which form in the later , more quiescent period in the evolution of our sgals , are clearly formed from material more enriched by sne  ia , which produces iron , and have lower [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "in this section , we address two potential limitations of our simulations : first , the fact that we assumed an einstein  de - sitter model instead of the prefered `` concordance model , '' and second , the fact that our simulations deal with the collapse of an isolated top hat perturbation .      in our simulations , the background cosmological model was an einstein - de  sitter model with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath49 .",
    "however , observations now favor a flat , cosmological constant model ( @xmath20cdm ) with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "while using a different model would have a major effect on simulations of large - scale structure formation from gaussian random noise initial conditions , we can show that , in the context of the galaxy formation model we are using , the effect is negligible .",
    "the cosmological parameters at redshift @xmath53 can be expressed in terms of their present values using @xmath54    ( e.g. @xcite ) . using the",

    "afterward , the system becomes significantly denser than the background universe and the cosmology becomes irrelevant .",
    "even as late as @xmath61 , the smallest collapse redshift from our initial conditions , we have @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the model is very close to an einstein - de  sitter model from the initial redshift up to the redshift of collapse . in particular , once the galaxies have formed , the repulsive force caused by the cosmological constant in totally negligible .    we still need to compare the evolutionary timescales , which are determined by the hubble constant @xmath64 .",

    "this is because in our thick disk formation scenario the thick disk forms from well - enriched gas disk in situ , in a relatively short period .",
    "astration during and after the mergers , as well as the ongoing dissipative infall of gas ( see e.g. @xcite ) eliminates difference of metallicity of thick disk forming material , which leads to a relatively homogeneous metal rich and old stellar population , independent of vertical height .",
    "the m05 result is supported by other recent studies , d05 and @xcite .",
    "our thick disk stars have a combination of ages and metallicities which are able to explain the colors which db02 find in the diffuse envelope components they observe in their sample of 47 edge - on disk galaxies , as shown in figure  [ brrk ] .",
    "they believe that these envelopes are best explained by the prevalence of thick disks in spiral galaxies .",
    "a study by @xcite of 6 nearby edge - on late type galaxies with resolved stellar populations also finds evidence for a thick disk or halo population , but their preliminary analysis of red giant branch colors indicate that this stellar envelope is more metal poor than those found by m05 and d05 , with metallicities ranging between @xmath93}<-1.7 $ ] .",
    "this might suggest a diversity of the stellar population of the thick disks among different disk galaxies .",
    "our four sgals do not have such low metallicity .",
    "however , more statistical sample of sgals with different masses and merger histories might explain such observations .",
    "the building blocks which merge at high redshift in our thick disk formation scenario have primarily been enriched by sne  ii .",
    "we have shown in figures  [ alpha1]-[alpha4 ] that our thick disk formation scenario naturally explains the high @xmath0 enhanced abundance pattern observed in thick disk stars compared to thin disk stars ( e.g.@xcite ; bfli ) .",
    "this is because in our scenario thick disk stars form earlier than thin - disk stars , which have more chance to be enriched more by sne  ia .",
    "the other important fact affecting enhanced @xmath0-element abundances is high star formation rates during the merger epoch in which the thick disks form in our sgals .",
    "evidence that the thick disk has had a more intense star formation history than the thin disk was found by bfli , and @xcite .    in order to simulate several sgals with high resolution required for this study",
    ", use was made of simplified initial conditions .",
    "to place our study on a firmer cosmological background , we have used n - body simulations employing the concordance @xmath20cdm values to show that milky way sized dark halos evolve in a manner which supports our thick disk formation scenario .",
    "most of the mass of such halos are accreted from the merging of a few intermediate sized ( @xmath94 ) building blocks , with a period of peak merging activity of such halos at lookback time of @xmath95 .",
    "this is consistent with the study of @xcite , who find that dark halos of mass @xmath96 have a characteristic phase of mergers / disruption of subhalos of mass @xmath97 at a lookback time of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , @xcite remark on the proximity in time of this merger phase with the ages of milky way and extragalactic thick disks .",
    "the timescale of our merger period is also consistent with distributions for formation times of milky way sized dark matter halos expected in high resolution simulations of concordance @xmath20cdm cosmology ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our thick disk formation scenario is nicely coupled with the formation of an old , metal weak stellar halo population with @xmath0-element enhancement . in @xcite ,",
    "accretion of stars to the halo in gas rich merger events was highlighted as necessary in creating low mass , low metallicity stellar halos in sgals .",
    "hence , many such halos stars formed in building blocks prior to the multiple merging epoch . the relatively low masses ( recall the well established mass - metallicity relation for galaxies ) , and short times afforded for star formation prior to merging , ensure that these stars are metal poor .",
    "this can explain the oldest , and most metal poor halo stars .",
    "figures  [ alpha1]-[alpha4 ] show that the halo stars will also have @xmath0-element enhancement .",
    "this halo star formation scenario was also highlighted in a recent semi - analytical study by @xcite , who showed that building blocks which merge at high redshift are likely to be a few relatively large ( @xmath98 ) dwarf irregular analogs , with @xmath0-element enhancement .",
    "we feel it necessary to re - iterate the comment made in bkgf that late , direct accretion of stars after a disk has formed , in the manner described in @xcite can also play a role in contributing to the thick disk population ( e.g. @xcite ) . such accretion has been shown to play a role in formation of the stellar halo ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one recent study needs to be mentioned here .",
    "@xcite present evidence for the existence of a counter - rotating thick disk in fgc 227 .",
    "existence of counter - rotating thick disks would rule out models in which thick disks forms purely by monolithic collapse or from heating of a previous thin disk , and strongly favors accretion / merger models .",
    "the initial conditions of our models , in which a solid body rotation is imparted on our initial sphere , means that we can not directly test for the existence of counter - rotating thick disks in the sgals presented in this paper .",
    "all building blocks of significant mass which merge during thick disk formation epoch in our four sgals have prograde rotation .",
    "however , it would not be surprising that in a multiple merger period there would be building blocks which have counter - rotation .",
    "hence , our thick disk formation scenario remains a good candidate for explaining such observations .",
    "however , more statistical observations and simulations based on full - cosmological context are required to test our scenario .",
