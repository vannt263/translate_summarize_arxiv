    "we use this manifold and apply standard constructions to fill out the part of the symplectic geography plane corresponding to signature less than @xmath6 . recall that taubes proved ( @xcite , also li - liu @xcite ) that minimal simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds satisfy @xmath1 , where @xmath4 denotes the euler characteristic and @xmath5 the signature .",

    "the existence of minimal symplectic 4-manifolds homeomorphic to @xmath34 for these four pairs remains an open problem ( as far as we know ) .",
    "the study of the geography problem for symplectic 4-manifolds has been an area of active study in recent years .",

    "the methods in this article are based on inductive constructions to produce simply connected manifolds starting with a few basic models .",

    "the mechanism used to kill fundamental groups comes down to establishing precise enough control over a group presentation to conclude that all generators die .",
    "this is a subtle process which depends critically on properly identifying words in fundamental groups , since e.g. in a group a pair of elements @xmath35 might commute but their conjugates @xmath36 need not .",
    "by contrast , the mechanism of the present paper is much softer .",
    "we use standard symplectic constructions pioneered by gompf @xcite and luttinger @xcite to kill a generator outright ; subsequent generators then are killed by a simple argument . in particular , although we are explicit and careful in our fundamental group calculations in theorem [ thm : technical_lem ] , lemma [ gen2xgen2 ] , and elsewhere , the reader will quickly understand that our results follow as easily if one only knows the statements up to conjugacy .    to illustrate this point , in the statement of lemma [ gen2xgen2 ] ,",

    "this less precise information is quite sufficient to prove the results of this article .",
    "the construction is also suitable to fill out a large region of the geography plane starting with any given symplectic 4-manifold with given characteristic numbers and containing a square zero symplectic torus .",
    "for example , theorem [ wedge ] roughly says that given a symplectic 4-manifold @xmath39 , one can construct a new symplectic manifold @xmath40 with the same fundamental group as @xmath39 and satisfying @xmath41 and @xmath42 , for any @xmath43 in the cone @xmath44 .",

    "hence there remain 4 minimal simply connected symplectic odd 4-manifolds of signature less than or equal to @xmath12 , 97 minimal simply connected symplectic odd 4-manifolds of non - positive signature , and roughly 280 minimal simply connected odd symplectic 4-manifolds of signature less than or equal to 4 yet to be constructed .",

    "moreover , @xmath61 luttinger surgery ( see section [ lutsurgsec ] ) along certain curves on one or both of these tori yields a minimal symplectic 4-manifold .",
    "we then produce a family @xmath62 , of minimal symplectic 4-manifolds with euler characteristic @xmath63 and signature @xmath12 by taking a symplectic sum of @xmath64 with a minimal manifold constructed from luttinger surgery on a product of surfaces .",
    "this family @xmath65 again contains a pair of lagrangian tori @xmath66 with the same properties as those in @xmath53 .    taking the symplectic sum of many copies of @xmath67 ( and ,",
    "if needed , the elliptic surfaces @xmath68 ) along their tori and performing a @xmath69 luttinger surgery on the unused lagrangian tori yields our even signature examples . showing that the fundamental group vanishes is simple since the fundamental groups of @xmath67 and the homomorphisms induced by the inclusions of the tori are known . usher s theorem @xcite easily implies that the result is minimal .",
    "the manifolds @xmath67 contain @xmath6 surfaces disjoint from the @xmath70 which survive to @xmath6 surfaces in the symplectic sum and hence the result has an odd intersection form .",
    "producing odd signature manifolds follows the same general approach , but requires several small model manifolds with appropriate lagrangian tori to use as seeds for the symplectic sums .",
    "the construction is not quite as clean as in the even signature case .",
    "we construct a minimal symplectic 4-manifold @xmath71 with fundamental group @xmath72 , euler characteristic 15 , and signature @xmath73 .",
    "we also use the minimal simply connected symplectic 4-manifold @xmath74 constructed by gompf with euler characteristic @xmath75 and signature @xmath76 .",
    "these three manifolds each contain a lagrangian or symplectic torus appropriate for taking symplectic sums with many copies of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and as in the even case this produces minimal simply connected 4-manifolds of odd signature less than or equal to @xmath79 .",
    "the signature @xmath73 examples are constructed by a separate argument , and a few small examples not covered by our general construction are culled from the literature ( i.e. @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) or constructed explicitly ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) .",
