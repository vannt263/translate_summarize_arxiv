    "in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of metal superconductors , the cooper pairing instability caused by a net attractive interaction plays an essential role . a pair of electrons can be bound together by an arbitrarily weak attractive force between them , known as the cooper theorem .",
    "this theorem can by reformulated in the modern renormalization group ( rg ) theory , which states that the attractive interaction , characterized by a negative coupling constant @xmath2 , is a ( marginally ) relevant perturbation to the electronic system @xcite .",
    "the rg equation for @xmath2 takes the general form @xmath3 in three - dimensional ( 3d ) metals , where @xmath4 is a varying length scale and @xmath5 some constant .",
    "this equation tells us that , while a positive @xmath2 would flow to zero at large @xmath4 , a negative @xmath2 flows indefinitely to the strong coupling regime no matter how small its initial value is .    in the past three decades , there have been a great deal of research activities devoted to studying the physical properties of electronic systems in which the valence and conduction bands touch at a number of discrete points .",
    "examples include zero - gap semiconductors @xcite , @xmath6-wave high-@xmath7 cuprate superconductors @xcite , graphene @xcite , topological insulators @xcite , and weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "these materials exhibit different low - energy behaviors .",
    "however , irrespective of the microscopic details , a very common feature shared by these materials is that their low - energy fermionic excitations have a linear dispersion and thus can be described by @xmath8 species of massless dirac fermions .",
    "extensive recent theoretic studies @xcite have elaborated that the interparticle interactions can result in non - fermi - liquid behaviors and certain quantum phase transition .",
    "for instance , the long - range coulomb interaction is able to drive an excitonic insulating transition if its strength is sufficiently large @xcite",
    ". the coulomb interaction can also give rise to unusual spectral behaviors of dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the strong spin - orbit coupling may open a finite gap and as such produce a topological insulator @xcite .",
    "the cooper pairing of dirac fermions and the resultant superconducting transition are two subjects of considerable interest @xcite .",
    "the superconductivity might be mediated by various bosonic modes , such as phonons or plasmons , in graphene @xcite .",
    "when graphene is properly doped such that its fermi surface is close to a van hove singularity @xcite , even repulsive interaction can result in superconductivity via the kohn - luttinger mechanism @xcite .",
    "other pairing mechanisms are also possible and have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "recent experiment has revealed direct evidence for emergent superconductivity on the surface of a 3d topological insulator @xcite .",
    "the cooper pairing in intrinsic two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac semimetals in which the fermi energy is tuned to precisely the dirac points is particularly interesting .",
    "previous theoretical and numerical studies @xcite have found that , different from ordinary metals , the cooper theorem is no longer valid in undoped dirac semimetals . because the fermion density of states ( dos ) vanishes linearly near the band - touching points ,",
    "an infinitely weak attraction is not sufficient to bind dirac fermions together to form cooper pairs .",
    "cooper pairing can be triggered only when the attraction strength exceeds certain threshold @xcite , i.e. , @xmath9 with @xmath10 being a finite critical value .",
    "hence , there is a quantum phase transition between the semimetallic and superconducting phases , and the critical value @xmath10 defines the quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "it was proposed recently that a space - time supersymmetry emerges at such a quantum critical point @xcite , where the massless dirac fermions and the massless bosonic order parameter are connected by a superconformal algebra .",
    "an interesting question is whether the semimetal - superconductor quantum critical point and the emergent supersymmetry are robust against disorders . to answer this question ,",
    "it is necessary to investigate the impact of disorders on cooper pairing .",
    "it seems that disorders can promote superconductivity since it may generate a finite zero - energy dos .",
    "however , this could happen only in the presence of disorder that is a relevant perturbation to the system",
    ". on the other hand , disorder scattering could break cooper pairs by shortening the lifetime of dirac fermions , which would destruct superconductivity .",
    "moreover , there are at least three types of disorder in dirac semimetals @xcite , including random chemical potential , random mass , and random gauge potential .",
    "they have various physical origins , couple to dirac fermions in different manners , and can result in distinct low - energy behaviors @xcite .",
    "it thus turns out that the effects of disorders are rich and complicated . to acquire a clear understanding of disorder effects",
    ", one needs to treat the quartic pairing interaction and fermion - disorder coupling on an equal footing , and analyze how the critical coupling @xmath10 is affected by various types of disorder .    motivated by the above consideration , we will investigate in this paper the disorder effects by performing a perturbative rg analysis within an effective model that contains both quartic pairing interaction and fermion - disorder coupling .",
    "recently , nandkishore _",
    "_ @xcite and potirniche _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have studied the effects of random chemical potential on superconductivity .",
    "the main conclusion reached in the mean - field analysis @xcite is that superconductivity is enhanced . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the impact of all the three types of disorder .",
    "when the dirac semimetal contains weak random mass or random gauge potential , the time - reversal symmetry is broken and the anderson theorem @xcite is certainly invalid .",
    "we study the fate of superconductivity by carrying out rg calculations and find that , the critical bcs coupling @xmath1 increases to certain larger value @xmath11 when random mass or random gauge potential exists by itself , which makes it more difficult to realize cooper pairing in realistic materials .",
    "the effective strength of these two types of disorder either flows rapidly to zero or remains a small constant at low energies , thus the perturbative rg expansion is under control and the rg results are reliable .",
    "we therefore can conclude that superconductivity is more or less suppressed .",
    "if @xmath12 , the dirac semimetal remains gapless , but its low - energy properties are strongly affected by disorder . specifically , random mass leads to marginal fermi liquid ( mfl- ) like behavior , and random gauge potential induces non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior .",
    "as @xmath13 grows upon approaching @xmath11 , the dirac semimetal enters into a superconducting phase .",
    "the nature of such a qcp depends sensitively on the specific type of disorder : for random mass , @xmath11 defines a qcp between a mfl - like phase and a superconducting state ; for random gauge potential , @xmath11 defines a qcp between a nfl and a superconducting state .",
    "if only random chemical potential exists , the effective strength increases monotonously as the energy is lowered , which means that the perturbative rg method is out of control in the low - energy region and does not give us a clear answer to the fate of superconductivity . other efficient theoretic tool is needed to study the effects of random chemical potential on superconductivity .",
    "it is widely believed that random chemical potential generates a finite zero - energy dos , namely @xmath14 .",
    "similar to nandkishore _",
    "@xcite , we assume that the dirac fermion has only one flavor , with the surface state of a 3d topological insulator being an example . in this case",
    ", there is no conventional anderson localization @xcite , and the fermions become diffusive due to random chemical potential , but remain extended . as this problem can not be handled by perturbative rg , one might appeal to the mean - field analysis , such as the abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) approach @xcite .",
    "we will present a simple ag analysis and derive the superconducting gap equation after incorporating the impact of random chemical potential .",
    "however , it is important to remember that the original ag approach entirely ignores vertex corrections and is justified only in the limit @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the fermi momentum and @xmath17 the mean free path . in 2d",
    "dirac semimetal , we know that @xmath18 , thus the applicability of the ag approach is indeed not well justified .",
    "the importance of the vertex corrections needs to be carefully examined , which is an interesting task but goes beyond the scope of the present paper .    after investigating the impact of each single type of disorder",
    ", we also consider the coexistence of different types of disorder and find that they have significant mutual influence on each other .",
    "actually , once more than one types of disorder exist in the system , all three types of disorder are present and flow to strong couplings at low energies , driving the system entering into a highly disordered phase . in that case ,",
    "the fate of superconductivity remains undetermined .",
    "the rest of the paper will be organized as follows .",
    "we present the model hamiltonian in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] and studied the clean limit in sec .",
    "[ sec_clean ] .",

    "[ sec_discuss ] .",
    "we briefly summarize the results and highlight further works in sec .",
    "[ sec_summary ] .",
    "we begin with the following model hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath19 which may describe the dirac fermions on a 2d honeycomb lattice or on the surface of a three - dimensional topological insulator",
    ". the free term of dirac fermions is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fermi velocity and @xmath22 chemical potential .",
    "we use @xmath23 to denote the @xmath24 identity matrix , and @xmath25 with @xmath26 to denote the pauli matrices , which satisfy the algebra @xmath27 . since the goal of the present work is to examine the possibility of superconductivity in intrinsic dirac semimetals , we assume that the fermi surface is tuned to be exactly at the dirac points , and henceforth set @xmath28 . moreover , we assume there is one flavor of fermion , and neglect the possibility of anderson localization @xcite .",
    "a possible quartic short - range interaction of dirac fermions has the following form @xmath29 for simplicity , the coupling function @xmath30 can be replaced by a constant @xmath2 , which after renormalization will depend on the varying energy scale . making a fourier transformation leads to @xmath31 where the spinor @xmath32 and @xmath33 are introduced to describe dirac fermions .",
    "now we can expand the quartic coupling term as @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the first and fourth terms involve spinors with the same spin if we start from the interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq_h_int ] ) , which are indeed not allowed by the pauli principle @xcite .",
    "this implies that the interaction can not capture all the potential four - fermion interactions in a 2d dirac semimetal . to remedy this",
    ", we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and consider another quartic coupling term @xmath36 which can be expanded to give @xmath37 which contains all four types of four - fermion coupling term and hence can serve as the starting point .",
    "we then consider the coupling between fermions and disorders , which can be generically described by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant and the random field @xmath40 is taken to be a quenched , gaussian variable satisfying @xmath41 with @xmath42 being a dimensionless variance .",
    "the disorders are classified by the definitions of the matrix @xmath43 .",
    "more concretely , @xmath44 for random chemical ( scalar ) potential , and @xmath45 for random mass . in the case of random gauge ( vector )",
    "potential , there are two components for @xmath43 and @xmath39 : @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ". these disorders can be induced by various mechanisms in realistic dirac fermion materials .",
    "for instance , the dominant impurity in @xmath6-wave cuprate superconductors behaves like a random gauge potential @xcite , whereas random mass and random chemical potential appear in a 2d orbit antiferromagnet @xcite . in the context of graphene",
    ", random chemical potential might be produced by local defects or neutral absorbed atoms @xcite .",
    "the ripple configurations of graphene are usually described by a random gauge potential @xcite , and the random configurations in the substrates can generate random mass @xcite .    to make our consideration more generic ,",
    "we suppose all the three types of disorder coexist in the dirac fermion system and derive the rg equations for all the involved model parameters by employing the replica method to average over the disordered potentials @xcite .",
    "the impact of each single disorder on the fate of superconductivity can be readily studied by removing the rest two types of disorder .",
    "we then consider the interplay of different disorders and examine their mutual influence .",
