    "out - of - equilibrium systems are ubiquitous in nature and they play an essential role in many physical , chemical and biological phenomena @xcite . in an isolated system , a nonequilibrium state will spontaneously relax toward the state of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "however , a nonequilibrium steady state can be maintained in open systems by exchanging energy or matter with thermostats or chemiostats .",
    "such reservoirs generate thermodynamic forces  also called affinities @xcite  because they introduce inhomogeneities in the temperature , the pressure , or the chemical potentials of the different species of molecules . in turn , the thermodynamic forces or affinities generate fluxes of energy or matter across the system , which contribute to positive entropy production as described at the macroscopic level by nonequilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the study of nonequilibrium steady states has a long history .",
    "already in the xixth century , nonequilibrium steady states were studied in linear electric circuits composed of resistors , capacitors , and inductors . in this context , kirchhoff developed a network theory to determine the steady state solution @xcite . with the beginning of the xxth century , the interest shifted to electric circuits with nonlinear elements such as vacuum tubes and , moreover , fluctuations in electric currents such as the nyquist - johnson and shot noises were discovered , in particular , under the influence of einstein s work on brownian motion and its electric analogue @xcite . since 1948 , nonlinear elements as transistors and diodes have become dominant in electric circuits .",
    "these elements have macroscopic characteristic curves which are not linear contrary to resistors . at the mesoscopic level , all the electric circuits present fluctuations in their currents . in this",
    "regard , the currents are random variables and the time evolution of the system is a stochastic process .",
    "the random variables are described in terms of a probability distribution .",
    "this latter obeys a master equation ruling the stochastic process .",
    "the random transitions are described in terms of the transition rates which may depend on the state variables .",
    "similar considerations apply to chemical and biochemical reactions . in the sixties , hill and coworkers developed stochastic models for the transport of ions across a membrane in biophysics @xcite . at the beginning of the seventies ,",
    "nicolis and coworkers developed stochastic models of autocatalytic chemical reactions to investigate the effects of fluctuations on the macroscopic nonequilibrium instabilities @xcite .",
    "autocatalytic chemical reactions have reaction rates which depend nonlinearly on the chemical concentrations .",
    "however , we recover a linear description at the mesoscopic level since the master equation ruling the time evolution of the probability distribution is linear .",
    "the analogy between the nonequilibrium steady states of stochastic processes and linear electric circuits was used since the sixties by hill @xcite , oster and coworkers @xcite , and schnakenberg @xcite .",
    "schnakenberg developed a network theory using the methods by kirchhoff for linear electric circuits in order to determine the steady state solution @xcite . in this network theory ,",
    "a graph is associated with the stochastic process .",
    "the vertices of this graph are the mesoscopic states of the stochastic system and the edges the possible transitions between the states .",
    "this graph can be decomposed into cycles .",
    "schnakenberg made the fundamental observation that the ratio of the products of the transition rates along a cycle and its time reversal is independent of the mesoscopic states and only depend on the macroscopic thermodynamic forces or affinities maintaining the system out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this observation allowed schnakenberg to express several thermodynamic properties and , in particular , the macroscopic entropy production in terms of the cycles of network theory @xcite .",
    "later , the theory of these cycles has been further developed by the qians @xcite .",
    "recently , remarkable properties of the molecular fluctuations have been discovered in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the time evolution of the molecular fluctuations can be characterized in terms of their large deviations with respect to their average .",
    "several large - deviation dynamical relationships have been obtained such as the formulas of the escape - rate and hydrodynamic - mode theories @xcite , as well as the nonequilibrium work theorem @xcite and the fluctuation theorems @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation theorems are symmetry relations originating from microreversibility for the probability distributions of fluctuating quantities , which are of interest for nonequilibrium thermodynamics and transport properties .",
    "these new large - deviation relationships are under current investigations to explore the range of their applications .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to apply the fluctuation theorem to the nonequilibrium stochastic processes described by schnakenberg network theory .",
    "these processes include , in particular , models of electronic transport in mesoscopic conductors @xcite , as well as chemical and biochemical reactions maintained out of equilibrium by differences of chemical potentials between the reactants and the products @xcite .",
    "chemical systems are out of equilibrium if the concentrations of reactants and products are not in their equilibrium ratio fixed in terms of the standard free enthalpies of formation of the reactions , as described in chemical thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the differences of free enthalpies between the reactants and products play the role of thermodynamic forces or affinities . in this regard ,",
    "the thermodynamic forces have energetic and entropic contributions , and do not reduce to mechanical forces as for external electric forces acting on charged particles . instead",
    ", the macroscopic thermodynamic forces or affinities may differ from the mesoscopic thermodynamic forces which depend on the mesoscopic states and are thus time - dependent fluctuating variables as the currents @xcite .",
    "in such systems , the macroscopic thermodynamic forces or affinities should be defined in terms of cycles , as shown by schnakenberg @xcite .    here",
    ", we are interested in the fluctuation theorem for the currents which are fluctuating variables at the mesoscopic level .",
    "our aim is to give an algebraic proof of this theorem for the generating function of the currents associated with schnakenberg s macroscopic affinities . for this aim",
    ", we have to identify schnakenberg s cycles .",
    "this is carried out by considering the characteristic determinant of the operator giving the generating function as its leading eigenvalue .",
    "our results can be applied to a large variety of processes including nonequilibrium chemical reactions and electronic transport in mesoscopic conductors @xcite . for non - reactive systems driven in their bulk by an external mechanical force or for non - reactive systems driven at their boundaries by time - independent chemical potentials , the fluctuation theorem for the currents already established in refs .",
    "@xcite is recovered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the stochastic description in terms of the master equation in section [ me - snt ] where schnakenberg network theory is summarized .",
    "we also illustrate the theory with an example of a chemical reaction network . in section [ gft ] ,",
    "the generating function of the currents is introduced by using schnakenberg s graph analysis and the fluctuation theorem for the currents is proved in this general framework . in section [ lsft ] , we discuss the connection between the fluctuation theorem for the currents and the fluctuation theorem for the action functional by lebowitz and spohn @xcite .",
    "we also show how the fluctuation theorem for the currents can be used to measure the entropy production in some mesoscopic systems even if the microscopic transition rates are not known .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "many nonequilibrium phenomena are successfully described at the mesoscopic level in terms of markovian random processes . in some simple systems ,",
    "such processes can even be exactly derived from the underlying deterministic dynamics @xcite by introducing an appropriate partition of the phase space . in other systems ,",
    "such processes can be rigorously derived from the underlying hamiltonian classical or quantum dynamics in some scaling limit @xcite .",
    "continuous - time random processes are ruled by an evolution equation , called the master equation , for the probability to find the system in a coarse - grained state @xmath0 at time @xmath1 : @xmath2 \\label{master.equ.}\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath3 denote the rates of the transitions @xmath4 allowed by the elementary processes @xmath5 .",
    "each one of these elementary processes may independently contribute to the entropy production so that it is important to separate them in the master equation .",
    "this is the case in nonequilibrium reaction systems where each reaction @xmath6 contributes to the entropy production @xcite .",
    "the master equation is known to obey a @xmath7-theorem for the entropy @xmath8 associated with the probability distribution @xmath9 describing the state of the system at the time @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the entropy due to the statistical distribution of all the degrees of freedom which are not specified by the coarse - grained state @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the coarse - grained state @xmath0 only specifies the numbers of the particles of the different species , @xmath10 is the entropy of the statistical distribution of the positions and momenta of the particles .",
    "the second term is the contribution to entropy due to the statistical distribution @xmath9 of the numbers of particles @xcite .",
    "the entropy is here calculated in the units of boltzmann s constant @xmath11 j / k .",
    "the time derivative of the entropy is given by @xmath12 in terms of the entropy flux @xmath13 and the non - negative entropy production @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the current of the transition @xmath16 and @xmath17 the corresponding affinity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-theorem asserts that the entropy production ( [ prod.entropie ] ) is always non - negative in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics and thus characterizes the irreversibility of the process .    in a stationary state where @xmath18 , the master equation ( [ master.equ . ] ) can also be written as @xmath19 in terms of the currents ( [ meso.fluxes ] ) , which is nothing else than the kirchhoff current law @xcite .    in the equilibrium stationary state , the conditions of detailed balance @xmath20 are satisfied for all the possible forward and backward transitions @xmath21 . consequently , the currents ( [ meso.fluxes ] ) and the affinities ( [ meso.affinities ] ) as well as the entropy production ( [ prod.entropie ] ) all vanish at equilibrium .      schnakenberg has shown that many of the fundamental properties of a nonequilibrium random process can be investigated and understood by carrying out the analysis of the graph associated with the master equation @xcite .",
    "moreover , schnakenberg found that the nonequilibrium constraints of a system are related to the affinities of the cycles of the graph , obtaining in this way an early form of the fluctuation theorem @xcite .",
    "let us first introduce the tools needed for the graph analysis of the random process .",
    "for a system ruled by the master equation ( [ master.equ .",
    "] ) , a graph @xmath22 is associated as follows @xcite : each state @xmath0 of the system corresponds to a vertex while the edges represent the different transitions @xmath21 allowed between the states . accordingly , two states can be connected by several edges if several elementary processes @xmath6 allow transitions between them .",
    "a method has been provided by schnakenberg to identify all the cycles of a graph @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the definition of a maximal tree @xmath23 of the graph @xmath22 , which should satisfy the following properties :    \\(1 ) @xmath23 is a covering subgraph of @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 contains all the vertices of @xmath22 and all the edges of @xmath23 are edges of @xmath22 ;    \\(2 ) @xmath23 is connected ;    \\(3 ) @xmath23 contains no circuit , i.e. , no cyclic sequence of edges .    in general a given graph",
    "@xmath22 has several maximal trees @xmath23 .",
    "the edges @xmath24 of @xmath22 which do not belong to @xmath23 are called the chords of @xmath23 .",
    "if we add to @xmath23 one of its chords @xmath24 , the resulting subgraph @xmath25 contains exactly one circuit , @xmath26 , which is obtained from @xmath25 by removing all the edges which are not part of the circuit .",
    "the set of circuits @xmath27 is called a fundamental set .",
    "an arbitrary orientation can be assigned to each circuit @xmath26 to define a cycle @xmath28 .",
    "a maximal tree @xmath23 together with its associated fundamental set of cycles @xmath29 provides a decomposition of the graph @xmath22 .",
    "we notice that the maximal tree @xmath23 can be chosen arbitrarily because each cycle @xmath28 can be redefined by linear combinations of the cycles of the fundamental set .",
    "an orientation is given to each edge of the graph @xmath22 .",
    "the directed edges are thus defined by @xmath30 let @xmath31 be a directed subgraph of @xmath22 .",
    "the orientation of the subgraph @xmath31 with respect to its edges @xmath32 is described by introducing the quantity @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath31 are said to be parallel ( resp .",
    "antiparallel ) if @xmath31 contains the edge @xmath34 in its reference ( resp .",
    "opposite ) orientation .",
    "it will be useful for the following to write the affinities and the fluxes in terms of these numbers . in the nonequilibrium steady state ,",
    "the affinity of the edge ( [ directed.edge ] ) is defined by @xmath35 the affinity of an arbitrary cycle @xmath36 is then written as @xmath37 where the sum is taken over all the edges @xmath34 of the graph @xmath22 .",
    "it can be equally written as @xmath38 with @xmath39 indeed , the terms @xmath40 $ ] exactly cancel each other when calculated on a closed path . moreover , we can introduce a scalar product @xmath41 where @xmath28 is the graph of the fundamental set associated with the chord @xmath24 as introduced above .",
    "it takes the value @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) if @xmath36 contains the chord @xmath24 with the same ( opposite ) orientation , and @xmath44 otherwise .",
    "the affinity of any cycle @xmath36 can then be decomposed as @xmath45 where the sum extends over all the chords .",
    "this shows in particular that the affinity of an arbitrary cycle is a linear combination of the affinities of a fundamental set @xcite .",
    "finally , applying successively kirchhoff current law ( [ kirch ] ) , the mean current traversing the edge @xmath34 is written as : @xmath46    nonequilibrium constraints are imposed to a system if the temperature , the pressure , or the chemical potentials differ between the reservoirs surrounding the system .",
    "these constraints are characterized by the global thermodynamic forces or affinities defined by the differences of the temperatures , pressures , or chemical potentials of the reservoirs .",
    "these global affinities do not directly appear in the transition rates @xmath47 of the master equation ( [ master.equ . ] ) .",
    "these rates depend on the temperature , the pressure , or the chemical potentials of the reservoir responsible for the transition @xmath48 and also on the states @xmath0 and @xmath49 , although the global affinities @xmath50 are defined by the _ differences _ of the temperatures , pressures , or chemical potentials of the reservoirs and are independent of the particular states @xmath0 or @xmath49 . in this regard ,",
    "the global affinities are macroscopic .",
    "as observed by schnakenberg @xcite , the global macroscopic affinities @xmath50 can be identified by considering the cycles @xmath51 of the graph @xmath22 associated with the stochastic process .",
    "the fact is that the ratio of the products of the transition rates along the two possible time directions of any cycle @xmath28 of the graph is independent of the states composing the cycle and only depends on the global macroscopic affinities @xmath50 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the edges ( [ directed.edge ] ) in the cycle @xmath28 .",
    "the conditions ( [ ratio ] ) are satisfied in a large class of processes including diffusion processes in lattice gases , nonequilibrium chemical reactions , and electronic transport in mesoscopic conductors @xcite .",
    "we notice that there can exist more cycles @xmath28 than currents @xmath54 between the reservoirs .",
    "the reason is that the graph describes all the possible states and transitions at the mesoscopic level while the currents @xmath54 between the reservoirs are typically macroscopic and fewer than the mesoscopic states .",
    "the affinities or thermodynamic forces @xmath55 associated with the various cycles @xmath28 of a graph @xmath22 may thus take the same value for all cycles corresponding to the same current @xmath54 between two given reservoirs : @xmath56 for all @xmath57 .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the class of systems where the thermodynamic forces or affinities are defined by the schnakenberg conditions ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "these conditions are weaker than in systems with external mechanical forces where the affinities can be directly identified at the level of the transition rates @xmath47 themselves . here",
    ", the affinities only appear after closing the cycles @xmath28 , which significantly complicates the reasoning .",
    "our purpose in this section is to illustrate schnakenberg s network theory with the example of the nonlinear chemical network @xmath58 particles enter into the system from three different reservoirs , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",

    "fluxes of matter will cross the system between the three reservoirs . in a stationary state",
    "only two of them will be independent and it is necessary to distinguish them as they are independent macroscopic observables . according to the mass - action law @xcite , the transition rates of these reactions are proportional to the concentrations and given by @xmath64 \\omega   \\\\   w_{1}(x\\vert x-1 ) & = & k_{-1 } x \\\\",

    "this example shows that the mesoscopic affinities ( [ meso.affinities ] ) depend in general on the state of the system and will thus fluctuate in time together with the corresponding currents ( [ meso.fluxes ] ) along a stochastic trajectory of the process .",

    "there is the additional constraint that there can not be two edges pointing towards the same vertex .",
    "this results from the fact that the permutations form a group and are therefore inversible .",
    "this constraint implies that the determinant only contains terms corresponding to some cycles of the graph plus some fixed vertex ( called full circuit in graph theory ) .",

    "the present framework allows us to clearly identify the macroscopic currents between the reservoirs maintaining the system out of equilibrium .    another important aspect of this construction concerns the numerical obtention of the generating function ( [ q.flux ] ) . indeed if we integrate eq .",

    "we here use the convention that the orientation of the fundamental cycles are such that @xmath89 .",
    "this means that the cycles are oriented in the same way as the chords @xmath24 but this is not restrictive .",

    "( [ a.decomp ] ) , we can check that the transformation @xmath212 leaves this term invariant , which proves the fluctuation theorem ( [ ft.be ] ) and thus ( [ ft.eta_e ] ) .",

    "accordingly , the fluctuation theorem ( [ ft.eta_e ] ) or ( [ ft.be ] ) implies @xmath217 which is the fluctuation theorem ( [ ft.new.gen.macro ] ) for the macroscopic currents .",
    "this establishes the link between the generating functions and their corresponding fluctuation theorem .",

    "the entropy production can thus be obtained thanks to the formula ( [ entropy.prod ] ) solely in terms of the nonequilibrium fluctuations of the currents .",
    "in this paper , we have established the fluctuation theorem for the currents for stochastic processes in which the macroscopic thermodynamic forces or affinities are identified thanks to the conditions ( [ ratio ] ) of schnakenberg @xcite .",
    "this class of stochastic processes includes models of electronic transport in mesoscopic conductors @xcite , biophysical models of ion transport across membranes @xcite , and autocatalytic chemical reactions @xcite . in these stochastic processes , the mesoscopic affinities",
    "( [ meso.affinities ] ) , which are often considered , depend on the mesoscopic state variables and are thus fluctuating in time , as illustrated for the case of schlgl s reaction scheme in subsection [ example ] .",

    "the ratio of the products of the transition states along each cycle and its time reversal is directly related to a macroscopic thermodynamic force or affinity , as shown by schnakenberg @xcite .",

    "moreover , we have also shown that the fluctuation theorem and the measurement of the fluctuating currents should provide a new procedure to obtain the entropy production even if the transition rates are not known , as it is often the case in an experimental situation .    in conclusion , this theory can be applied to a large variety of processes in physics , chemistry , or biology .",
