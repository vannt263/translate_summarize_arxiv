    "the general riemann problem is based on the calculation of the one - dimensional temporal evolution of a fluid which , at some given initial time , has two adjacent states characterized by different values of uniform velocity , pressure and density . from a mathematical point of view , the riemann problem is an initial value problem for a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations , with initial conditions characterized by a discontinuity between the two initial states .",
    "these initial conditions establish the way in which the discontinuity will decay after removal of the barrier separating the initial `` left '' and `` right '' states .",
    "the schematic evolution of a general riemann problem can be represented as ( mart & mller 1994 ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes a shock or a rarefaction wave that propagates towards the left @xmath2 or the right @xmath3 with respect to the initial discontinuity , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the known initial left and right states , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the new hydrodynamic states that form behind the two waves propagating in opposite directions .",
    "these waves are separated by a contact discontinuity @xmath8 and therefore have the same values of the pressure and velocity , but different values of the density .",
    "the riemann problem is said to be solved when the velocity , pressure and density in the new states @xmath6 and @xmath7 have been computed , as well as the positions of the waves separating the four states .",
    "the solution of the one dimensional riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics was discussed in the general case by mart & mller ( 1994 ) and the reader is referred to their work for further details ( see also pons _",
    "_ 2000 , for the extension to multidimensions ) .",
    "the numerical solution of a riemann problem is the fundamental building block of hydrodynamical codes based on godunov - type finite difference methods . in such methods ,",
    "the computational domain is discretized and each interface between two adjacent grid - zones is used to construct the initial left and right states of a `` local riemann problem '' .",
    "the evolution of the hydrodynamical equations is then obtained through the solution across the computational grid of the sequence of local riemann problems set up at the interfaces between successive grid - zones ( see mart & mller 1996 , but also godunov 1959 and colella & woodward 1984 ) .",
    "the `` core '' of each of these local riemann problems consists of determining the fluid pressure across the contact discontinuity , which can be calculated by imposing the continuity of the normal component of the fluid velocity across @xmath8 @xmath9 in general , ( [ vls = vrs ] ) is a nonlinear algebraic equation in the unknown pressure @xmath10 and requires a numerical solution .",
    "depending on the different wave patterns forming after the decay of the discontinuity , a different nonlinear equation will need to be solved .",
    "this initial `` ambiguity '' in the wave pattern produced corresponds to the fact that the interval in pressure bracketing the solution @xmath10 is not known a priori . in practice",
    "this lack of information is compensated by the use of efficient numerical algorithms which , via a process of trial and error , determine the correct wave pattern and then proceed to the solution of the corresponding nonlinear equation ( mart , & mller 1999 ) .    in this paper , we show that the relativistic expression for the relative velocity between the two initial states is a function of the unknown pressure @xmath10 and so a new procedure for numerically solving the exact riemann problem can be proposed in which the pressure @xmath10 is no longer obtained by the solution of equation ( [ vls = vrs ] ) . rather , @xmath10 is calculated by equating the relativistic invariant expression for the relative velocity between the two initial states with the value given by the initial conditions .    when compared to equivalent approaches , our exact riemann solver has some advantages .",
    "firstly , we can remove the ambiguity mentioned above and determine the generated flow pattern by simply comparing the relative velocity between the two initial states with reference values built from the initial conditions of the riemann problem .",
    "doing so provides immediate information about which of the nonlinear equations ( one for every wave pattern ) needs to be solved . secondly , by knowing the wave pattern we can produce an immediate bracketing of the solution .",
    "doing so gives improved efficiency in the numerical root finding procedure .",
    "finally , for one of the wave patterns ( i.e. for two rarefaction waves moving in opposite directions ) our method provides the solution of the relativistic riemann problem in a closed analytic form .",
    "because of its simplicity , the numerical implementation of our method is straightforward and can be accomplished with a much smaller number of lines of code . when compared with other exact riemann solvers ( e. g. mart & mller 1999 ) it has also proved to be computationally more efficient .",
    "in particular , when solving a generic hydrodynamical problem ( in which one solves for very simple riemann problems ) the approach proposed here brackets the solution very closely and this produces substantial computational improvements of up to @xmath11 . for the cases discussed here however , where very strong shocks are considered",
    ", the speed - up is below @xmath12 .",
    "this paper briefly introduces our idea and is organized as follows : in section  [ setup ] we define the mathematical set - up for the formulation of the riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics . in section  [ lrvs ]",
    "we determine the basic relativistic expressions linking the velocities ahead of and behind a shock or a rarefaction wave .",
    "these expressions will be used repeatedly in the following sections  [ case_i][case_iii ] , where will write explicit criteria for the occurrence of the three possible wave patterns .",
    "section  [ ni ] discusses how the criteria can be used for making an efficient numerical implementation of a riemann solver and briefly presents a comparison of performances with more traditional algorithms .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusion ] presents our conclusions . throughout",
    ", we use a system of units in which @xmath13 .",
    "consider a perfect fluid with four - velocity @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the lorentz factor and with a stress - energy tensor @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the proper energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "assume moreover that the fluid obeys a polytropic equation of state @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the proper rest mass density , @xmath23 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath24 is the polytropic constant , dependent only on the specific entropy @xmath25 ( the latter is generally assumed to be different in the two initial states ) .",
    "straightforward expressions can be written relating @xmath19 and @xmath20 to the specific enthalpy @xmath26 and to the specific internal energy @xmath27 of the fluid @xmath28 consider now the fluid to consist of an initial left state ( indicated with an index @xmath29 ) and an initial right state ( indicated with an index @xmath30 ) , each having prescribed and different values of uniform pressure , density and velocity .",
    "the discontinuity between the two states which has been constructed in this way will then decay producing one of the three wave patterns listed below    _ ( i )  _ _ two shock waves _",
    ", one moving towards the initial left state , and the other towards the initial right state : @xmath31 .    _",
    "( ii )  _ _ one shock wave and one rarefaction wave _ , the shock moving towards the initial right state , and the rarefaction towards the initial left state ( or viceversa if @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 .    _",
    "( iii )  _ _ two rarefaction waves _",
    ", one moving towards the initial left state , and the other towards the initial right state : @xmath34 . a special case of this wave pattern is produced when the two rarefaction waves leave a vacuum region behind them .",
    "the basis of our approach lies in the possibility of determining `` a priori '' which of these three wave patterns will actually result by simply comparing the value of the special relativistic relative velocity between the initial left and right states @xmath35 with the values of the limiting relative velocities for the occurrence of the wave patterns _",
    "( i)(iii)_. in this respect , our approach represents the relativistic generalization of a similar analysis proposed in newtonian hydrodynamics by landau and lifshitz ( 1987 ) ( see also gheller 1997 for a numerical implementation ) .",
    "mathematically , the occurrence of the different cases can be distinguished because the relative velocity ( [ vrel ] ) is a continuous monotonic function of the pressure @xmath10 across the contact discontinuity .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where we have plotted @xmath36 as a function of @xmath10 and it is proved mathematically in appendix a. note that the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is effectively produced by the continuous joining of three different curves describing the relativistic relative velocity for the three different wave patterns corresponding respectively to two shocks ( 2s , indicated as a dashed line ) , one shock and one rarefaction wave ( sr , indicated as a dotted line ) , and two rarefaction waves ( 2r , indicated as a continuous line ) .",
    "the joining of the different curves occurs at precise values of the relative velocity which we have indicated as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and which depend uniquely on the initial conditions of the two unperturbed states .",
    "these three values of the relative velocity mark the extremes of three different intervals on the vertical axis and correspond to the three different cases _ ( i)(iii)_.    within this framework then , it is sufficient to compare the relative velocity between the initial states ( [ vrel ] ) with the calculated values of the limiting relative velocities @xmath37 , @xmath40 , @xmath39 , to determine , in advance , which wave pattern will be produced .",
    "this , in turn , determines the correct equation to solve and the correct bracketing of the solution . in the following sections we will discuss in detail how to derive analytic expressions for the limiting relative velocities and use them efficiently within a numerical code .",
    "the expression for the relative velocity ( [ vrel ] ) is a relativistic invariant , but its calculation can be considerably simplified when performed in an appropriate reference frame . in practice , we will consider each of the three wave patterns _ ( i)(iii ) _ as being composed of two `` discontinuity fronts '' ( two shocks , two rarefaction waves , or one of each ) moving in opposite directions and separated by a region where a contact discontinuity is present . in the case of a shock",
    ", in particular , it is useful to use a reference frame comoving with the shock front , in which the relativistic expression for the relative velocities ahead of ( @xmath41 ) and behind ( @xmath42 ) the shock takes the form ( taub 1978 ) @xmath43    in the case of a rarefaction wave , on the other hand , it is more convenient to use the eulerian frame in which the initial states are measured and which has one of the axes aligned with the direction of propagation of the wave front . in such a frame , the flow velocity at the back of a rarefaction wave ( i.e. behind the tail of the rarefaction wave ) can be expressed as a function of pressure at the back of the wave as @xmath44 the quantity @xmath45 in ( [ raref ] ) is defined as ( mart & mller 1994 ) @xmath46      \\left[\\frac{(\\gamma-1)^{1/2}+c_s(p_a ) }      { ( \\gamma-1)^{1/2}-c_s(p_a ) }      \\right]\\right\\}^{\\pm2/(\\gamma-1)^{1/2}}\\ , \\ ] ] with the @xmath47 signs corresponding to rarefaction waves propagating to the left ( @xmath48 ) and to the right ( @xmath49 ) of the contact discontinuity , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath50 in ( [ apm ] ) is the local sound speed which , for a polytropic equation of state , can be written as @xmath51 we can now use expression ( [ raref ] ) to write an invariant expression for the relative velocity across a rarefaction wave ( i.e. the relative velocity of the fluid ahead of the rarefaction wave and behind the tail of the rarefaction wave ) as @xmath52 expressions ( [ rel_shock ] ) and ( [ rel_raref ] ) are not yet in a useful form since they can not be combined to give ( [ vrel ] ) .",
    "however , we can exploit the fact they are relativistic invariants to evaluate them in the rest frame of the contact discontinuity .",
    "the latter is , by definition , comoving with the fluid behind the discontinuity fronts and within such a frame we can set @xmath53 and use equations ( [ rel_shock ] ) , ( [ rel_raref ] ) to obtain an explicit expression for the velocity ahead of the wave front .",
    "the expressions for the velocities ahead of both discontinuity fronts obtained in this way can then be combined so as to evaluate expression ( [ vrel ] ) .    in the following sections we will apply the procedure outlined above to derive the relative velocity between the left and right states for the three different wave patterns _ (",
    "i)(iii)_. we will denote with indices @xmath54 and @xmath55 the quantities evaluated in the left ( @xmath6 ) and right ( @xmath7 ) states behind the discontinuity fronts , and where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "note also that in all of the different cases we will assume that @xmath59 , and take the positive @xmath60-direction as being the one from the region @xmath29 to the region @xmath30 ( an alternative opposite choice is also possible . ) .",
    "we start by considering the wave pattern produced by two shocks propagating in opposite directions ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this situation is characterized by a value of the pressure downstream of the shocks which is larger than the pressures in the unperturbed states , i.e. @xmath62 . applying equation ( [ rel_shock ] ) to the shock front moving towards the left and evaluating it in the reference frame of the contact discontinuity , we can write the velocity ahead of the left propagating shock as @xmath63    similarly , we can apply equation ( [ rel_shock ] ) to the shock front moving towards the right and evaluate it in the frame comoving with the contact discontinuity to obtain that the velocity ahead of the right propagating shock is @xmath64    equations ( [ v1_2s ] ) and ( [ v2_2s ] ) can now be used to derive the relativistic expression for the relative velocity of the flow ahead of the two shocks @xmath65 .",
    "as proved in appendix a , the expression for the relative velocity between the unperturbed states is a monotonic function of @xmath66 for all possible wave patterns . in particular",
    ", for the present choice of initial data , this expression is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath66 . as a result",
    ", the value of @xmath65 can be used to build a criterion for the occurrence of two shocks propagating in opposite directions .",
    "in fact , since @xmath67 is the smallest value that @xmath66 can take , two shocks will form if @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the only positive root of the taub adiabat ( taub 1978 , mart & mller 1994 ) @xmath71\\hat{h}^2      -\\frac{(\\gamma-1)(p_2-p_3)}{\\gamma p_3}\\hat h       + \\frac{h_2 ( p_2-p_3)}{\\rho_2}-h_2 ^ 2 = 0 \\ .\\ ] ] when @xmath72 .",
    "simple calculations reported in appendix b show that the newtonian limit of @xmath37 corresponds to the expression derived by landau and lifshitz ( 1987 ) .",
    "we next consider the wave pattern produced by one shock front propagating towards the right and one rarefaction wave propagating in the opposite direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this situation is therefore characterized by @xmath74 .",
    "evaluating expression ( [ rel_raref ] ) in the reference frame comoving with the contact discontinuity , we can evaluate the flow velocity ahead of the rarefaction wave to be @xmath75 where @xmath76      \\left[\\frac{(\\gamma-1)^{1/2}+c_s(p_{1 } ) }      { ( \\gamma-1)^{1/2}-c_s(p_{1 } ) }      \\right]\\right\\}^{2/(\\gamma-1)^{1/2}}\\ .\\ ] ] the flow velocity ahead of the shock front can be derived as in section [ case_i ] by evaluating equation ( [ rel_shock ] ) in the reference frame of the contact discontinuity to get @xmath77 which , combined with expression ( [ v1_sr ] ) , can be used to derive the relativistic expression for the relative velocity of the fluids ahead of the shock and ahead of the rarefaction wave @xmath78 . as for @xmath65",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath78 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath66 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and appendix a for an analytic proof ) .",
    "exploiting now the knowledge that for this wave pattern the pressure in the region between the two waves must satisfy @xmath79 , we can establish that the criterion on the relative velocity for having one shock and one rarefaction wave is @xmath80 note that the upper limit of ( [ cond_2 ] ) coincides with @xmath37 , which is the lower limit for the occurrence of 2 shock waves ( [ cond_1 ] ) and whose newtonian limit coincides with the equivalent one found by landau and lifshitz ( 1987 ) ( see appendix b ) .",
    "note also that in the limit , @xmath81 , regions 1 and 2 are connected by a single rarefaction wave . in this case",
    "the sound speed can be computed using @xmath82 but with @xmath83 .",
    "finally , note that this is the only wave pattern in which @xmath84 and @xmath85 have the same sign and it therefore includes the classical _ shock - tube problem _ , where @xmath86 .",
    "we now consider the wave pattern produced by two rarefaction waves propagating in opposite directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this situation is characterized by @xmath88 and when the waves are sufficiently strong it might lead to a vacuum region ( @xmath89 ) behind the rarefaction waves .",
    "following again the same procedure discussed in the previous section , we can determine the values of the fluid velocities ahead of the two rarefaction waves as , respectively , @xmath90 where @xmath91      \\left[\\frac{(\\gamma-1)^{1/2}+c_s(p_{2 } ) }      { ( \\gamma-1)^{1/2}-c_s(p_{2 } ) }      \\right]\\right\\}^{-2/(\\gamma-1)^{1/2 } }       \\ .\\ ] ] we have indicated with @xmath92 the sound speed in the region @xmath55 , which differs from the one in region @xmath54 because of the jump in the densities @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the relative velocity built using ( [ v1_2r ] ) and ( [ v2_2r ] ) is then @xmath95 as for the relative velocities of the previous wave patterns , it can be shown that @xmath96 , is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath66 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and appendix a for an analytic proof ) so that the criterion for the occurrence of two rarefaction waves can be expressed as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and therefore the upper limit for ( [ cond_3 ] ) coincides with the lower limit for ( [ cond_2 ] ) .",
    "the condition ( [ cond_3 ] ) can also be expressed in a more useful form as @xmath99 where , the constants @xmath100 and @xmath101 are shorthand for @xmath102^{2/(\\gamma-1)^{1/2 } } \\\\\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{k2 } s_2&\\equiv&\\left[\\frac{(\\gamma-1)^{1/2}+c_s(p_2)}{(\\gamma-1)^{1/2 }      -c_s(p_2)}\\right]^{-2/(\\gamma-1)^{1/2 } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an important property of equation ( [ v12_2r ] ) is that it can be inverted analytically .",
    "this involves rewriting it in terms of a quartic equation in the unknown sound speed in the region @xmath6 ( see appendix c for the explicit form of the equation ) .",
    "once the relevant real root of this equation has been calculated analytically , the value of the pressure @xmath10 can be found through a simple algebraic expression . in this case , therefore , the solution of the exact relativistic riemann problem can be found in an analytic closed form .",
    "we conclude the analysis of the different wave patterns with a comment on the case of two rarefaction waves propagating in opposite directions and leaving behind them a region with zero density and pressure .",
    "this situation occurs when the fluids in the regions 1 and 2 are moving sufficiently fast in opposite directions .",
    "this is the case whenever the relative velocity between the two states ahead of the rarefaction waves is less than or equal to the lower limit for @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath103 also in this case , taking the newtonian limit of @xmath39 we obtain the corresponding expression derived by landau and lifshitz ( 1987 ) ( see appendix b ) .",
    "finally , note that when a vacuum is produced , @xmath36 is no longer dependent on @xmath66 and this branch of the curve can not be plotted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the core of most exact riemann solvers , in both newtonian and relativistic hydrodynamics , is based on the numerical computation of the pressure in the regions @xmath6 and @xmath7 that form behind the waves .",
    "the key property exploited when performing the numerical calculation is that the velocity in such regions can be expressed as a monotonic function of the pressure i.e. @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "since there is no jump across a contact discontinuity in either the velocity or in the pressure , the numerical solution of the riemann problem consists then of finding the root @xmath106 of the nonlinear equation @xmath107 where @xmath108 have different functional forms according to the different wave patterns produced .",
    "this method has two obvious disadvantages : _ ( 1 ) _ it can not determine , using the initial conditions , the wave pattern produced and thus which of the functional forms to use for @xmath108 ; _ ( 2 ) _ it can not provide a straightforward bracketing interval for the root . in practice , however , these difficulties are effectively balanced by efficient algorithms based on a sequence of trial and error attempts that rapidly bracket the root and determine the correct equation to solve ( see , for instance , mart , & mller 1999 and the algorithm presented therein ) .",
    "the exact riemann solver which we propose here differs from the one discussed above mostly because it avoids the disadvantages _ ( 1 ) _ and _ ( 2)_. in fact , as discussed in section  [ intro ] , by comparing the relative velocity between the initial left and right states @xmath109 with the relevant limiting values constructed from the initial conditions @xmath110 ,",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath111 , we can determine both the wave pattern which will be produced and the correct bracketing range in the pressure .",
    "once this information has been obtained , the riemann problem can be solved either through the solution of equation ( [ marti ] ) or , equivalently , by looking for the value of the pressure @xmath10 which would produce a relative velocity @xmath109 .",
    "this latter approach , which we will be discussing in the following , involves then the solution of the nonlinear equation @xmath112 where @xmath113 is given by the expressions for @xmath65 , or @xmath78 , or @xmath96 derived in sections  [ case_i][case_iii ] .",
    "furthermore , in the case of two rarefaction waves , equation ( [ our ] ) can also be solved analytically .    besides providing direct information about the wave pattern produced , about the correct equation to solve and the relevant bracketing interval , our approach is also very simple to implement numerically . in practice ,",

    "we have also compared the performance of our algorithm with the `` standard '' approach presented by mart & mller 1999 and have found a systematic reduction in the computational costs for the same level of accuracy in the solution .",
    "the quantitative efficiency improvement depends on the type of problem under consideration . in the case of a generic hydrodynamical problem",
    "( in which very simple riemann problems are solved ) , our approach brackets the solution very closely and this produces substantial computational improvements of up to @xmath11 .",
    "however , for the specific cases discussed in this paper , where very strong shocks have been considered , the speed - up is smaller and of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth noting that such an improvement could reduce appreciably the computational costs in three - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics codes , where this operation is repeated a very large number of times .",
    "we have presented a new procedure for the numerical solution of the exact riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics . in this approach special attention",
    "is paid to the relativistic invariant expression for the relative velocity @xmath36 between the unperturbed left and right states .",
    "this has been shown to be a monotonic function of the pressure @xmath10 in the region formed between the wave fronts .",
    "the determination of this pressure is the basic step in the solution of the exact riemann problem .",
    "the use of the relative velocity has a number of advantages over alternative exact riemann solvers discussed in the literature .",
    "in particular , it extracts the information implicitly contained in the data for two initial states to deduce the wave pattern that will be produced by the decay of the discontinuity between these two states .",
    "this , in turn , allows an `` a priori '' determination to be made of the interval in pressure bracketing @xmath10 and the correct functional form for the nonlinear equation whose root will solve the exact riemann problem .",
    "all of these advantages translate , in practice , into a simpler algorithm to implement and an improved efficiency in the numerical solution of the riemann problem .",
    "furthermore , in the case of two rarefaction waves propagating in opposite directions ( and in strict analogy with what happens in newtonian hydrodynamics ) , the use of the relative velocity allows for the solution of the riemann problem in an analytic closed form .    because of all of the advantages discussed above , its intrinsic simplicity of implementation and the numerical efficiency gain it produces , this new exact riemann solver should be considered as an interesting alternative to the traditional exact riemann solver presently discussed in the literature .",

    "we here prove that @xmath36 is a monotonic function of @xmath10 for all of the possible wave patterns .",
