    "the doped rare earth manganites have been studied for many years @xcite and interest in the materials has revived following the recent discovery of extremely large magnetoresistance in some members of the family @xcite . the chemical formula is @xmath1 , with re a rare earth element such as la or nd and a a divalent metal ion such as sr or ca .",
    "the electronically active orbitals are believed to be the mn d - orbitals @xcite and the mean d - occupancy is @xmath2 .",
    "each mn ion feels an approximately cubic crystal field which splits the mn d - levels into a @xmath3 triplet and an @xmath4 doublet @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 levels are believed @xcite to lie substantially ( @xmath5 5ev ) below the @xmath4 levels .",
    "on - site coulomb interactions are apparently strong enough that no d - orbital may be occupied by more than one electron .",
    "further , all electron spins in mn-@xmath6 orbitals are aligned by a large ferromagnetic hunds - rule coupling .",
    "the coulomb and hunds - rule interaction energies have not been measured directly , but there is substantial indirect evidence that they are large .",
    "for example , at @xmath7 ( precise values depend on re and a ) the ground state is ferromagnetic , and the observed magnetization is consistent with all @xmath2 electrons on each mn being lined up in the maximal spin state @xcite , suggesting a large hunds coupling .",
    "also , @xmath8 undergoes a structural phase transition at @xmath9k , which has been shown @xcite to be due to a staggered ( @xmath10 ) ordering of jahn - teller distortion of locally @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "this would not occur unless the @xmath4 orbital were singly occupied , which in turn implies that the @xmath3 orbitals are also singly occupied , suggesting a large on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "the resulting physical picture is that @xmath11 of the @xmath12 d electrons fill up the @xmath3 levels , forming an electrically inert core spin @xmath13 of magnitude @xmath14 .",
    "the remaining @xmath15 electron goes into a linear combination of the @xmath4 levels , and is coupled to @xmath13 by a hunds rule coupling @xmath16 which is presumably large , but has not been directly measured .",
    "okimoto et al .",
    "have recently presented an interpretation of optical data implying that @xmath17ev @xcite .",
    "we shall argue below that their interpretation is not correct and that @xmath18 is rather larger .",
    "certainly , the conventional @xcite wisdom is that the limit @xmath19 is appropriate , so one only need consider configurations with @xmath4 electrons parallel to core spins .",
    "the @xmath1 materials display a wide range of interesting physics . for @xmath20 ( all x - values are approximate , and depend on re and a ) the materials are insulating at all temperatures and are antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic at low t. for @xmath21 the low - t phase is a fully polarized ferromagnetic metal .",
    "as the temperature is increased for @xmath21 , there is a ferromagnet to paramagnet transition , which may be of first or second order , at a @xmath22k . in the paramagnetic state",
    "the material may be either `` metallic '' ( in the sense that @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) or `` insulating '' ( in the sense that @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "( here @xmath27 , the mott `` maximum metallic resistivity '' , is about @xmath28-cm and corresponds to a mean free path of order @xmath29 @xcite ) .",
    "insulating behavior occurs at lower x and metallic behavior at higher x. there is for all x a very pronounced drop in @xmath30 as t is lowered through @xmath31 , and in this regime the resistivity has a very strong magnetic field dependence .",
    "the `` colossal '' magnetoresistance of interest here occurs for @xmath32 such that the material is in the `` insulating '' regime at @xmath33 but is a metallic ferromagnet at @xmath34 .",
    "finally , at @xmath35 the low t state is charge - ordered , antiferromagnetic and insulating @xcite .",
    "we do not address the physics of this regime here . a qualitative phase diagram is shown in fig",
    "most models @xcite of electron transport in @xmath1 have emphasized the `` double exchange '' phenomena caused by the large hunds coupling @xmath16 .",
    "the essence of double exchange is that when an electron hops from site @xmath36 to site @xmath37 it must also go from having its spin parallel to @xmath38 to having its spin parallel to @xmath39 ; the hopping amplitude , @xmath40 , thus depends upon relative spin orientation @xcite . for two fixed sites",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 it is possible to choose phase factors so that @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the double exchange phenomenon gives an obvious connection between electron hopping and magnetic order : disorder in the spins implies randomness in @xmath40 , which decreases below @xmath31 or in a field .",
    "this effect seems very likely to be related to the `` colossal '' magnetoresistance observed near @xmath31 .",
    "however , two of us and p. b. littlewood have recently argued that models involving only double exchange can not explain the observed resistivity @xcite .",
    "the essential point is that in materials exhibiting `` colossal '' magnetoresistance the resistivity at @xmath42 is much larger than the mott limit and moreover rapidly increases as t decreases . indeed , as shown in appendix a , the observed @xmath43 resistivities are so large that a classical description involving particles incoherently hopping from site to site with a hopping probability @xmath44 is appropriate . in models involving only double exchange",
    "the scattering produced by spin disorder is simply not large enough to cause such insulating behavior .",
    "a straightforward calculation @xcite shows that if the spins are completely decorrelated one finds @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 . more sophisticated arguments involving localization and phase factors are shown in appendix b not to change this conclusion significantly .",
    "therefore we believe some additional physics not included in the double exchange - only model must be important .",
    "this conclusion is not universally accepted @xcite    one possible source of this extra physics is the `` hubbard u '' effect of the on - site coulomb interaction which produced the hunds coupling in the first place . while this is undoubtedly quantitatively important , we do not believe it is the primary cause of the observed insulating behavior , essentially because away from commensurate densities ( such as one electron per site ) canonical mott insulating materials such as the high @xmath31 superconductors or other doped transition - metal oxides have resistivities which are rather less than the mott limit and which decrease with temperature @xcite , in stark contrast to the behavior observed at @xmath47 in @xmath1 .",
    "we proposed @xcite that the crucial additional physics is a strong electron - phonon coupling , which localizes the conduction electrons as polarons at @xmath33 and smaller @xmath32 , but is weakened in the @xmath34 ferromagnetic state , restoring metallic behavior .",
    "we argued that this is possible because the behavior of electron - phonon model is controlled by a dimensionless coupling parameter which is the ratio of an interaction energy to the electron kinetic energy .",
    "the double exchange physics implies that ferromagnetic order increases the electron kinetic energy , thereby decreasing the effective coupling strength . also , a recent analysis @xcite of the structural distortion observed @xcite in @xmath48 showed that the electron - phonon coupling is indeed strong .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed study of a model of electrons coupled to core spins and to phonons which we believe confirms the importance of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "we use a `` dynamical mean field '' method which has previously been extensively applied to interacting problems without double exchange @xcite and has been used by furukawa to study models involving only double exchange @xcite .",
    "the model we study does not capture all of the physics of @xmath1 ; in particular , coulomb effects and quantum and intersite terms in the phonon hamiltonian are omitted and an oversimplified electron - phonon coupling is used .",
    "we therefore can not quantitatively compare our results to experiment .",
    "the qualitative agreement we obtain is however compelling .",
    "other workers have also studied electron - phonon effects in manganites and related materials .",
    "emin , hillery and liu studied a theoretical model of a single bound polaron coupled to spin waves and found a temperature dependence of the polaron size which they argued could be related to transport anomalies at @xmath31 observed in euo @xcite .",
    "their work , however , is based on models in which double exchange physics is not relevant , reflecting the different physics of euo .",
    "roder , zang and bishop used variational wavefunction techniques to examine the interplay between electron - phonon interaction and double exchange @xcite . their work is in a sense complementary to ours .",
    "they have incorporated quantum phonons and have presented some results on intersite phonon correlations , but their technique seems to work best at low temperatures . to calculate properties at and above @xmath31 they resort to a dilute limit approximation which amounts to the study of a single carrier in a deformable medium .",
    "also , they have not presented results for transport and optical quantities ; their main result is a calculation of the coupling dependence and doping dependence of @xmath31 .",
    "their results for the coupling dependence are very similar to ours ; their results for the doping dependence are based on an assumption which , we argue , is not justified by the arguments in their paper a comparison of their results for @xmath31 to ours is given in section iv , and a further discussion is given in the conclusion .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the model and the approximations used . in section iii",
    "we give the qualitative physics of the model , distinguishing different regimes and presenting the behavior of physical quantities in each . in section",
    "iv we present the results of a detailed numerical study of the model at half - filling . in section",
    "v we present and discuss results at other dopings .",
    "section vi is a conclusion , in which the relation of results to data is analysed and the effects of omitted interactions are outlined .",
    "appendix a discusses the theoretical interpretation of the observed resistivities , in particular the relation to the mott minimum metallic conductivity and to transport by classical particles while appendix b discusses in more detail the resistivity of the double exchange - only model .",
    "an announcement of some of the results of this paper has been submitted elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this paper relies heavily on results of a companion paper which uses the dynamical mean field method to study electron - phonon interactions in models without double exchange @xcite , to which we refer henceforth as i.",
    "we study a model of mn @xmath4 d - electrons coupled to core spins @xmath38 and phonons , with hamiltonian @xmath49 @xmath50 describes the hopping of d - electrons between sites @xmath51 of a lattice .",
    "we take the electrons to have two - fold orbital degeneracy labelled by a roman index ( a , b ) and two fold spin degeneracy labelled by a greek index @xmath52 . explicitly , @xmath53 the hopping matrix element @xmath54 is a real symmetric matrix whose form depends on the choice of basis in @xmath55 space and the direction of the @xmath56 bond",
    ". the precise form will not be important in what follows .",
    "the interaction of itinerant electrons with the core spins is given by @xmath57 as discussed below , we shall take the limit @xmath58 .",
    "we assume a jahn - teller form for the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "previous analysis @xcite has shown that this coupling is strong in @xmath48 , so it may be expected to be strong also in doped compounds .",
    "thus we focus on lattice distortions which split the on - site orbital degeneracy of the @xmath4 levels .",
    "physically , these correspond to @xmath4 symmetry distortions of the oxygen octahedra around an mn site . mathematically",
    ", we may parametrize a local @xmath4 distortion by a magnitude @xmath59 and an angle @xmath60 , and define a two - component vector @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the coupling of this to the @xmath4 levels is prescribed by group theory @xcite to be @xmath64 here @xmath65 is a vector of pauli matrices acting in orbital space .",
    "it is important to note that the coupling written in eq .",
    "[ eq : helph ] is not the only physically relevant one . in ref @xcite it was argued that a mn site with no @xmath4 electrons would induce a breathing distortion of the surrounding oxygen ions , and that this breathing distortion played an important role in determining the x dependence of the structural phase boundary .",
    "we have not included this coupling in the present calculations , but will qualitatively discuss its effects in the conclusion .    in order to obtain a tractable model we assume @xmath66 describes classical harmonic oscillators of stiffness @xmath67 which are furthermore independent from site to site .",
    "thus , @xmath68    despite the simplifying approximations , the model defined by eq . [ eq : h ] is not solvable except in certain limits . to obtain results",
    ", we adopt the `` dynamical mean field '' approximation , which becomes formally exact in a limit in which the spatial dimensionality @xmath69 and has been shown to provide a reasonable description of models of interacting electrons in @xmath70 @xcite .",

    "[ eq : hband ] and @xmath75 is the self energy due in the present problem to @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the fundamental approximation of the dynamical mean field method is the neglect of the momentum ( p ) dependence of @xmath75 .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation because models of the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : h ] ( such as the usual migdal - eliashberg electron - phonon hamiltonian ) generally lead to a self energy with a weak momentum dependence in @xmath70 @xcite .",

    "@xcite we had also used an alternative method ( which we termed the _ projection method _ ) based on the observation that by choice of an appropriate local spin reference frame one may map the model into one of spinless fermions moving in a lattice with a spatially varying hopping determined by the local spin orientations .",

    "another crucial result of i is that the transitions between the different regimes are controlled by the values of an effective coupling determined by the ratio of an electron - phonon energy to a kinetic energy .",
    "as we have seen , the kinetic energy is temperature dependent because of double exchange ; thus as temperature is varied the behavior of the model may change from `` metallic '' @xmath198 to insulating ( @xmath199 . as t is decreased below @xmath31",

    "the correspondence is interesting because the calculation of ref @xcite was done with quantum phonons with the rather high frequency @xmath210 ( units not specified , but presumably set by the electron hopping , @xmath113 ) .",

    "@xmath31 is visible as a kink on each curve . at @xmath43 ,",

    "the @xmath141 values obtained by extrapolating the @xmath43 curves to 0 are non - zero , and are higher than the actual @xmath141 values , because the reduction of kinetic energy due to spin disorder has effectively made the electron - phonon coupling stronger .",

    "the estimates obtained in @xcite imply @xmath238 in that material ; thus @xmath239 in fig .",

    "the kinetic energy changes between 0 and @xmath31 by a somewhat larger amount ; for @xmath244 , by still larger amount , for @xmath245 , yet larger .",
    "these changes come from the previously discussed interplay between double exchange and electron - phonon coupling . as t",

    "this can be seen by comparing figs 2 and 5 .",
    "these arguments also explain the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity . increasing the field",
    "aligns the spins , increases the kinetic energy , and decreases the effective electron - phonon coupling , leading to a large change in resistance as shown in figs 6a and 6b . when the decrease in effective electron - phonon coupling tunes the model across the `` metal''-``insulator '' transition , as in fig .",
    "6b , the magnetoresistance is particularly large .    further insight into the interplay of double exchange and localization comes from the optical conductivity shown in fig .",
    "panel 7a shows @xmath246 at different t for the weak coupling @xmath247 . at low t @xmath248",
    "has approximately the drude form @xmath249 with scattering rate @xmath250 as expected from classical phonons . as t is increased through @xmath31 the drude peak broadens and acquires a t - independent part , due to spin scattering .",
    "panel 7b shows @xmath248 for the moderate coupling @xmath213 . at low t",
    ", @xmath248 has the drude form ; as t is increased a broad peak develops ; this is due to transitions between the two jahn - teller split levels .",
    "it is broad because the phonon coordinate is strongly fluctuating , so the level position is not well defined .",
    "as t increases beyond @xmath31 the peak broadens almost to indistinguishability . note also that as t is increased , the optical spectral weight @xmath251 decreases , reflecting the increasing localization of electrons by phonons . in models such as the present one which do not have galilean invariance and involve only a limited number of orbitals , the f - sum rule spectral weight is not constant and is indeed proportional to the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "panel 7c shows that at a stronger coupling @xmath248 does not have the drude form , and the peak is already evident at @xmath252 .",
    "note that the maximum in @xmath248 has moved to a slightly higher frequency .",
    "recently published data of okimoto et al .",
    "on @xmath253 @xcite are similar to the curves shown in fig .",
    "7c , although our use of classical phonons means that we can not obtain the very narrow drude peak found at low t. panel 7d shows @xmath248 at the still stronger coupling @xmath254 where the model has a large frozen - in lattice distortion even at @xmath141 .",
    "the @xmath248 has an insulating appearance , above and below @xmath31 , but as t is decreased the peak in @xmath248 shifts to a lower freqency and grows in intensity , reflecting the effectively weaker coupling . the nonmonotonic behavior of the dc conductivity is not reflected in @xmath255 at @xmath256 .",
    "the curves in fig 7d resemble data recently obtained by kaplan et .",
    "al . on @xmath257 @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the physical interpretation of @xmath258 in more detail in the next section and in the conclusion .",
    "here we note that in the strong - coupling regime the two d - states on a site are split .",
    "the peak in the optical conductivity corresponds roughly to a transition in which an electron moves from an occupied orbital on one site to an unoccupied orbital on an adjacent site . in our classical approximation",
    ", `` franck - condon '' transitions involving also emission or absorption of a phonon can not occur at all . in a more realistic model",
    "such effects would e.g. increase the low - frequency tails by a small amount .",
    "the width of the peak in @xmath259 is determined by the broadening of the localized states due to electron hopping and by thermal broadening , which leads to a range of lattice distortions and thus to a range of splittings .",
    "in this section we present and discuss results of numerical calculations for the particle - hole asymmetric case @xmath260 . as discussed in i ( see especially figs . 10 , 11 ) , at @xmath260 in the strong coupling limit the spectral function has a three - peaked structure .",
    "the outer two peaks represent the jahn - teller - split @xmath4 levels on occupied sites , and occur also for @xmath200 .",
    "the middle peak comes from unoccupied sites , on which there is no jahn - teller splitting .",
    "these states tend to fill in the gap created by the jahn - teller splitting and mean that stronger coupling is required to obtain insulating behavior at @xmath260 than at @xmath200 .",
    "further , in the strong coupling limit the temperature dependence of physical quantities is determined by the energy difference between filled and mid - gap states ; thus at fixed jahn - teller splitting the activation gap for physical properties is much less at @xmath260 than at @xmath200 .",
    "note also that @xmath31 is controlled by the electron kinetic energy which is in turn controlled by the jahn - teller splitting .",
    "therefore , in the strong coupling limit at fixed @xmath31 the activation gap characterizing the @xmath42 resistivity is much larger at @xmath200 than at @xmath260 .",
    "this physics is immediately apparent in the resistivity curves for @xmath261 and @xmath262 shown in fig .",
    "comparison to fig .",
    "3 shows that much stronger couplings are required to obtain a @xmath25 for @xmath261 than for @xmath200 and stronger couplings yet are required for @xmath262 .",
    "the smaller value of the activation gap relative to @xmath31 means that the resistivity rises less before the behavior changes at @xmath31 for @xmath260 than for @xmath263 . for @xmath200 , @xmath264",
    "we found an order - of - magnitude rise in @xmath30 as @xmath123 is decreased to @xmath31 , and we found metallic behavior below @xmath31 . at @xmath260 it is difficult to produce much of an up - turn in @xmath30 at @xmath265 for parameters such that the model is metallic at @xmath141 .",
    "this physics is due to the particular ( jahn - teller ) form of the electron - phonon coupling we have chosen to study .",
    "the same arguments mean that it is not possible to get as large a magnetoresistance at @xmath260 as at @xmath200 .",
    "figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of the resistance for several different coupling strengths and magnetic fields . to get even a moderately large effect",
    "one must choose a very strong coupling , such that the model is insulating for both @xmath42 and @xmath34 .    finally , fig .",
    "10 displays the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity at @xmath261 and moderate ( @xmath266 ) and strong ( @xmath267 ) coupling , and compares this to the momentum - integrated spectral functions .",
    "one sees by comparing energies that at strong coupling the two maxima in the conductivity may be associated with transitions from the lowest peak in the spectral function ( representing occupied orbitals on occupied sites ) to the middle feature ( representing unoccupied orbitals on unoccupied sites ) and to the higher feature ( representing unoccupied orbitals on occupied sites ) . at @xmath200",
    "the middle peak in @xmath268 is absent and @xmath248 has only one peak , as seen in fig . 7d .",
    "of course , the on - site d - d transition is not optically active : the calculated conductivity involves electron motion from one site to another , and for this reason @xmath248 is not simply given by a convolution of two local spectral functions .",
    "one may see this in fig .",
    "the central peak in @xmath269 has less area than the upper one , yet the lower peak in the corresponding @xmath259 is the larger .",
    "this may be understood from the above arguments : a transition from the lower to the middle peak of @xmath270 necessarily involves moving an electron from one site to the other , but some of the transitions from lower to higher are on - site transitions which do not contribute to @xmath248 .",
    "note also that the @xmath271 spectral function shown in figs 10b , d has a sharp minimum at @xmath272 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact , discussed in i , that the probability of a small - amplitude lattice distortion is small because of the @xmath273 measure , and decreases as @xmath123 increases , due to the shift to higher @xmath274 of @xmath275 .",
    "as can be seen in the corresponding optical conductivity curves in figs 10a , c , this minimum is of little significance for other physical quantities .",
    "we have used the `` dynamical mean field '' approximation to solve a model of electrons ferromagnetically coupled to classical spins and jahn - teller coupled to localized classical oscillators . in a companion paper ( i )",
    "we considered electron - phonon coupling in a variety of models without double exchange .",
    "the results presented in section iv for the half - filled case bear a striking resemblance to data for the `` colossal magnetoresistance '' materials @xmath1 in the @xmath276 regime where the ground state is metallic .",
    "we believe the agreement supports the idea that the important physics of @xmath1 involves the interplay between a strong electron - phonon coupling and the `` double exchange '' effect of magnetic order on the electronic kinetic energy .",
    "specifically , the @xmath277 curves shown in fig .",
    "3 are very similar to those shown , e.g in @xcite . varying the electron - phonon coupling produces changes very similar to those found experimentally by varying @xmath32 and the constituents @xmath278 and @xmath268 .",
    "the magnetic field dependences shown in fig 6 also bear a striking resemblance to data .",
    "fig 6b looks very like fig . 2 of @xcite , while fig 6a resembles magnetoresistance data which would be observed for @xmath279 .",
    "( it should be noted , however , that the fields used to produce our curve , although very small compared to microscopic energies , are larger than experimental fields by a factor of about 5 ) .",
    "the variation of the rms lattice distortion shown in fig 4 has been observed via measurements of the @xmath4 component of the oxygen debye - waller factor @xcite .",
    "further , optical conductivity data of okimoto et .",
    "@xcite on @xmath253 bear a strong qualitative resemblance to fig 7b , while data obtained by kaplan et .",
    "@xcite strongly resemble fig 7c .",
    "as noted in sections iv and v , in our interpretation the higher frequency peak in @xmath280 is due to transitions between levels split by an electron - phonon coupling .",
    "okimoto et .",
    "al . interpreted the higher peak differently , attributing it to transitions from an inital @xmath4 state aligned to the core spin to a final @xmath4 state antialigned to the core spin .",
    "they argued that their identification was supported by the fact that in their data the higher peak was only visible at @xmath33 , and vanished at low t when all spins were aligned .",
    "however , the data of kaplan et .",
    "al . demonstrate that in some samples the high frequency peak does not vanish below @xmath31 and indeed grows in oscillator strength as t decreases .",
    "this rules out the interpretation of okimoto et .",
    "al . , at least for that sample .",
    "the detailed qualitative agreement between data and our model leaves little doubt that we have identified the important physics governing the @xmath1 materials .",
    "however , several very important issues remain unresolved .",
    "one concerns the origin of the experimentally observed material and doping dependence of the results , which are _ modelled _ in the @xmath200 calculations by varying the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "another is the degree of `` fine - tuning '' of parameters required . a third concerns the effects of omitted interactions and a fourth is that , as shown in section v , computations at different electron concentrations @xmath260 agree much less well with data . in the remainder of this paper we present a qualitative discussion of all of these issues , which , we argue , are closely related .",
    "we begin with the @xmath260 calculations .",
    "we showed that the differences between the @xmath200 and @xmath281 results are due to the presence , for @xmath260 , of mid - gap states in the spectral function ( shown , e.g. , in fig . 10 ) .",
    "these mid - gap states occur because we used a particular form of electron - phonon coupling , namely a jahn - teller coupling which splits the d - state degeneracy on a site if there is one electron on the site , and does nothing otherwise . in ref",
    "@xcite it is argued that the existence of the jahn - teller coupling justifies a model involving only one orbital per site .",
    "the results presented here suggest that this is oversimplified , because it does not take in to account the mid - gap states",
    ". a model with only jahn - teller coupling does not suffice .",
    "however , results presented in i strongly suggest that if the model were extended in a way which moved both the upper peak and the mid - gap states up in energy , then the model would become effectively a single - orbital model and results for @xmath260 would much more closely resemble those obtained for @xmath200 .",
    "one omitted piece of physics which will have precisely this effect is the breathing - mode distortion of the oxygen octahedron around an mn site .",
    "the breathing mode couples to charge fluctuations on the mn site .",
    "this coupling is likely to be at least as strong as the jahn - teller coupling , as may be seen from the following argument : the jahn - teller coupling is due to the dependence of the force exerted on an o ion on the orbital occupied by the outer - shell d - electron . whatever its magnitude , this force is unlikely to be larger than the force created by simply removing that d - electron , and making an unbalanced charge .",
    "the breathing - mode coupling was recently argued to be important for the small - x structural phase boundary @xcite . to understand the effects of the breathing mode , consider again fig .",
    "the central peak in the spectral function depicted in the low - t curve in fig 10d gives the states available for adding an electron to an unoccupied site .",
    "if such a site has a breathing distortion already present , the energy cost of adding an electron will be increased , thus the middle feature will also move up in energy , increasing the gap as required .",
    "another important piece of physics is the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "this must be strong because if it were not , the hund s coupling @xmath16 would not be large @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction leads to two related effects .",
    "one is most easily discussed by reference to the spectral functions and optical conductivities shown in fig . 10 .",
    "now the @xmath282 part of the spectral function corresponds to states into which an electron maybe added ; the upper peak thus gives the states available for adding an electron onto a site which already has an electron .",
    "the coulomb interaction must move such states up in energy , and must similarly move up the second peak in @xmath246 . if the coulomb energy is of the order of the hunds coupling , then it is very likely that this effect will move the higher peak out beyond the physically interesting energy range @xmath283 ev .    the combined effect of the breathing distortion and the coulomb interaction is therefore to lead to a spectral function with at most two peaks in the energy range of interest .",
    "the only difference between this realistic situation and the situation encountered in the @xmath200 calculations is that the realistic spectral function is not symmetric under the interchange of the two peaks .",
    "this asymmetry was shown in i not to be important .",
    "a second effect of a strong coulomb interaction is to localize the electrons .",
    "it is likely that the observed very strongly insulating behavior of @xmath8 is not due solely to the jahn - teller order , and that @xmath8 is to some degree a mott insulator .",
    "now the kinetic energy @xmath136 of a mott insulator has a pronounced doping dependence @xcite . for @xmath1",
    "one would expect @xmath284 to increase with @xmath32 for @xmath285 . because , as we have argued at length , the properties of electron - phonon models are controlled by the ratio of a coupling energy and a kinetic energy",
    ", this will lead to an x - dependence of the effective coupling strength , with larger @xmath32 having a weaker effective coupling .",
    "we believe that this strong x - dependence of the effective coupling accounts for the ubiquity of the `` colossal '' magnetoresistance phenomenon .",
    "different materials have different bare electron hoppings and probably different electron - phonon couplings , but in all materials the variation of the electron kinetic energy with @xmath32 is large enough to sweep the effective coupling through the critical value at some x between @xmath286 and @xmath287 .    the breathing distortion may be studied via the dynamical mean field formalism used here ; one must simply integrate over another variable in eq [ eq : zloc ] .",
    "the on - site coulomb interaction may also be included , but one must perform functional integrals rather than simple integrals .",
    "monte carlo techniques are required , the computational expense is greater and the accuracy is less",
    ". such an investigation would however be desirable .",
    "two other effects not included in the calculation should be mentioned .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the phonons have been omitted .",
    "as discussed in i , these will in the absence of long range order or commensurate density lead to metallic behavior at sufficiently low t , even in the strong coupling limit . the neglect of the phonon momentum and quantum fluctuations of core spins is not an important approximation because we are primarily interested in phenomena at temperatures of order room temperature ; however if needed they could be incorporated into the formalism .",
    "the neglect of intersite phonon correlations is potentially more serious .",
    "it is tempting to argue that they are unimportant because we are interested in optical phonons , which are usually weakly dispersing .",
    "however , in the @xmath8 structure each o is shared by two mn ; there must thus be a strong correlation between jahn - teller distortions on adjacent sites . in @xmath48",
    "the jahn - teller distortions have long range order ; estimates presented in @xcite suggest that in @xmath1 the correlation length of the jahn - teller distortions is @xmath288 as long as the resistivity is well above the mott limit . extending the present calculations to include the effects of intersite correlations is an important open problem .",
    "it is worth addressing because in the present calculations the correlation length is zero and the strong - coupling physics is of polarons . in the infinite correlation length limit",
    ", the physics has to do with interband transitions in a bandstructure defined by jahn - teller order .",
    "the situation in the actual materials is presumably intermediate between these two limits .",

    "it is maximal at @xmath298 and vanishes at @xmath141 .",
    "the resistivity has been calculated , using methods which are essentially perturbative in the amplitude of the spin disorder , by kubo and ohata @xcite and more recently by two of us and littlewood @xcite .",

    "similar results have been obtained using the dynamical mean field method .",
    "these calculations omit several physical effects and have been questioned recently by varma @xcite . in this appendix",
    "we show that the omitted effects are not important .",
    "we begin by describing the omitted effects . in the double exchange",
    "only model , the scattering is due to spin disorder which , if the core spins are assumed to be classical , may be treated as static scattering with the important proviso that the disorder is annealed , not quenched . when applied to a model with static scattering , the dynamical mean field approximation with semicircular density of states is equivalent to the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) for the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "the cpa neglects localization ( as do the perturbative calculations @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of closed loops on the bethe lattice also means that berry phase effects arising from particle motion in a spin background are omitted .",
    "we consider the berry phase effects first . in the double exchange model",
    "the hopping matrix element between two sites @xmath36 and @xmath37 is with core spins characterized by polar angles @xmath299 , @xmath300 , is @xmath301 if closed loops are not important one may choose the @xmath302 independently on each site and recover the familiar double exchange result @xmath303 . in general the @xmath95 factors around a closed loop",
    "produce something like a magnetic field , which may scatter electrons . in the limit of strong ferromagnetic correlations",
    "the phase dependent term may be seen to be very small because all nearby sites have very similar angles , which may be taken to be near 0 . in the limit of uncorrelated spins",
    "we may estimate the size of the effective field by comparing the phase sensitive part of the hopping to the phase insensitive @xmath304 part . by integrating @xmath40 , around square placquette one",
    "finds that the phase sensitive part is @xmath305 while the phase insensitive part is @xmath306 .",
    "thus the rms deviation of the amplitude for an electron to move around a placquette is @xmath307 of the phase insensitive part .",
    "this combined with the relative insensitivity of three dimensional physics to closed loops suggest phase effects , while interesting , are too weak to cause the observed strongly insulating behavior .",
    "we now turn to localization . the problem at hand concerns electrons with random hopping , which has not received much attention . economou and antoniou @xcite",
    "have studied a bethe - lattice model in which the hopping amplitude @xmath113 has the symmetrical distribution @xmath308 for this model @xmath309 , the mean value of t , equals @xmath310 and the variance @xmath311 .",
    "the double exchange model at @xmath312 ( so the spins are completely disordered ) corresponds to the distribution @xmath313 the localization effects of the double exchange distribution have not been determined .",
    "we expect that because the most probable value is also the largest hopping , the double exchange distribution will produce fewer localized states than a semicircular distribution with the same mean and variance .",
    "now from eq [ eq : p_d - ex ] one sees that the double exchange distribution has mean @xmath314 and variance of @xmath315 .",
    "thus it should produce fewer localized states than the model of economou and antoniou with @xmath316 and @xmath317 , i.e. with @xmath318 .",
    "inspection of ref @xcite reveals that at this ratio of @xmath319 , a negligible fraction of the states are localized .",

    "drawing precise conclusions is somewhat difficult because one result of ref @xcite is that the number of localized states increases rapidly for @xmath320 .",
