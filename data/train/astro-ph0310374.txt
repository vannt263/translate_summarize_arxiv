    "we continue our monitoring program of snr 1987a with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. as of 2002 december , we have performed a total of seven observations ( table 1 ) .",
    "results from the first six observations have been reported in the literature ( burrows et al .",
    "2000 ; park et al . 2002 , 2003",
    "; michael et al .",
    "the x - ray morphology was ring - like and asymmetric ( brighter in the east ) with the emergence of x - ray - bright spots .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was described with a plane - parallel shock in a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) state with an electron temperature of @xmath0 @xmath1 2.5 kev . a blast wave shock velocity of @xmath2 @xmath1 3500 km s@xmath3 was derived from the detected x - ray line profiles , which also provided direct evidence of an electron - ion non - equilibrium behind the shock .",
    "the x - ray flux was non - linearly increasing as the blast wave approaches the dense inner ring .",

    "+ @xmath5  the first observation was split into two sequences , which were combined in the analysis .",
    "the acis - s3+hetg was used .",

    "1 shows the overall brightening and development of new x - ray bright spots , particularly in the western side of the snr .",
    "snr 1987a is expected to be a complete ring in x - rays . in 2000 , the strong correlation between the soft x - ray and the optical images was interpreted as emission from the slow shock encountering protrusions of the dense inner ring .",
    "the correlation between the hard x - ray and the radio images was consistent with emission from the fast shock propagating into an hii region interior to the ring .",
    "as of 2002 - 12 , correlations between the x - ray and the optical / radio images are more complex than such a simple picture , which is perhaps expected as the blast wave is reaching the main body of the inner ring .",
    "the x - ray spectrum from each observation can be fitted with a single nei plane shock model with an electron temperature of @xmath0@xmath12@xmath63 kev and low abundances ( 0.1@xmath60.5 solar ) .",
    "based on the data with the most significant photon statistics , we find that the electron temperature has decreased slightly , while the volume emission measure ( em ) has substantially increased for the last two years ( fig .",
    "2 ) . these results are consistent with our physical picture of the blast wave encountering a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) . a growing contribution to the observed spectrum from the slow shock",
    "is then expected ( michael et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "a two - temperature model indeed statistically improves the fit , particularly with the latest data ( fig .",
    "the soft component ( @xmath0@xmath10.25 kev ) implies a slow shock velocity ( @xmath2@xmath1400 km s@xmath3 ) with a highly advanced ionization state ( @xmath7@xmath110@xmath8 @xmath9 s ) .",
    "this is consistent with the decelerated shock front in the dense csm .",
    "the 0.5@xmath65 kev band flux from the soft component has tripled since 2000 - 12 , while the flux from the hard component has doubled .",
    "we note that the flux increase from the slow shock in the western half ( by a factor of 6 ) is much larger than in the east ( @xmath130% ) .",
    "the flux increase from the fast shock is constant between the east and the west .",
    "these results suggest that the blast wave has now begun to encounter the dense csm in the western side of the snr a few years after it did in the eastern side .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve shows a non - linear flux increase rate ( fig .",
    "we have thus attempted non - linear fits to the data : e.g. , in fig .",
    "4 , we present a fit by assuming an exponential density distribution along the radius of the inner ring .",
    "the best - fit model implies an @xmath120 times higher density in the inner ring than in the hii region .",
    "the actual density contrast , which might be higher than this , could be measured as the shock - csm interaction proceeds .",
