    "from as way back as the @xmath6 , it has been known that the orbit of the planet mercury exhibits a peculiar motion of its perihelion , specifically , the perihelion of mercury advances by @xmath7 @xmath8 . when newton s theory of gravitation is applied to try and explain this ( by making use of the oblateness of the planets",
    "because when the sun s gravitational force acts on the oblate - planets , the oblateness causes torque [ on the planets ] and this torque is thought to give rise to the anomalous motion of the planets ) ; it was found first by leverrier in @xmath9 see _ e.g. _ @xcite that it predicted a precession of @xmath10 @xmath8 which is larger than the observed @xcite . with the failure of newton s theory to explain this , it was proposed that a small undetected planet was the cause .",
    "careful scrutiny of the terrestrial heavens by telescopes and spaces probes reveals no such object  the meaning of which is that the cause may very well be a hitherto unknown gravitational phenomena ",
    "einstein was to demonstrate that this was the case , that there existed a hitherto unknown gravitational phenomena that is the cause of this peculiar motion .    with the herald of einstein s",
    "general theory of relativity ( gtr ) in @xmath11 , einstein immediately applied his gtr to this problem ; much to his elation which caused him heart palpitations  he obtained the unprecedented value of @xmath12 and this was ( and is still ) hailed as one of the greatest triumphs for the gtr and this lead to its quick acceptance .",
    "venus , the earth , and other planets show such peculiar motion of their perihelion .",
    "observations reveal a shift of @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively ( see _ e.g. _ kenyon @xmath15 ) .",
    "einstein s theory is able to explain the perihelion shift of the other planets well , so much that it is now a well accepted paradigm that the perihelion shift of planetary orbits is a general relativistic phenomena .",
    "einstein s gtr explains the perihelion shift of planetary orbits as a result of the curvature of spacetime around the sun .",
    "it does not take into account the spin of the sun and at the same time it assumes all the planets lay on the same plane .",
    "the assumption that the planets lay on the same plane is in the gtr solution only taken as a first order approximation  in reality , planets do not lay on the same plane . in this reading",
    "we set forth what we believe is a new paradigm ; we have coined this paradigm the azimuthally symmetric theory _ of _ gravitation ( astg ) and this is derived from poisson s well accepted equation for empty space ",
    "namely @xmath0 .",
    "poisson s law is a differential form of newton s law _ of _ gravitation .",
    "we explain the perihelion shift of the orbits of planets as a consequence of the spin of the sun ",
    "_ i.e. _ solar spin .",
    "it is well known that the sun does exhibit some spin angular momentum  specifically , it [ the sun ] undergoes differential rotation . on the average , it spins on its spin axis about once in every @xmath16 _ days _ ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "its spin axis makes an angle of about @xmath17 with the ecliptic plane .",
    "it is important that we state clearly here that by no means have we discovered a new theory or a set of new equations ; we have merely applied poisson s well known azimuthally symmetric solution to gravity for a spinning gravitating body .",
    "further , with regard to einstein s gtr  _ vis _ ; in its solution to the problem of the perihelion shift of planetary orbits , it [ the gtr ] assumes the traditional newtonian gravitational potential , namely : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is newton s universal constant of gravitation , @xmath20 is the mass of the central gravitating body and @xmath21 is the radial distance from this gravitating body .",
    "einstein s gtr which is embodied in einstein s law of gravitation , namely :    @xmath22    is designed such that in the low energy limit and low spacetime curvature such as in the solar system , this equation reduces directly to poison s equation . in einstein s law",
    "above , @xmath23 is the ricci tensor , @xmath24 the ricci scalar , @xmath25 the metric of spacetime , @xmath26 is einstein s controversial cosmological constant which at best can be taken to be zero unless one is making computations of a cosmological nature where darkenergy is involved , and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the speed of light in vacuum ; and poisson s equation is given by :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the density of matter and the operator @xmath31 written for spherical coordinate system ( see figure [ scoord ] for the coordinate setup ) is given by :    @xmath32    [ scoord ] , the zenith ( the angle from the north pole ; the colatitude ) denoted by @xmath33 , and the azimuth ( the angle in the equatorial plane ; the longitude ) by @xmath34.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as already been said , our solution or paradigm , hails directly from poisson s equation , which in itself is a first order approximate solution to einstein s gtr , albeit with the important difference that we have taken into account solar spin .",
    "this fact that our paradigm explains reasonably well  within the confines of its error margins ; the precession of planetary orbits as a consequence of solar spin and at the sametime the gtr explains this same phenomena well as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime raises the question * `` is the precession of the perihelion of solar orbits a result of ( 1 ) solar spin or ( 2 ) is it a result of the curvature of spacetime ? '' * if anything , this is the question that this reading seems to raise .",
    "an answer to it , will only come once the meaning of the astg is fully understood .    in the above we say the astg _",
    "`` explains reasonably well  within the confines of its error margins '' _  what immediately comes to mind is that can a theory have error margins or is it not experiments that have error margins ?",
    "as will be seen , certain undetermined constants ( @xmath35 ) in the theory emerge and at present , one has to infer these from observations and it is here that the error margins of the astg come into play .",
    "further , we show , that _ in - principle _ , the astg does explain ( 1 ) the increase in the mean earth - sun distance , ( 2 ) the increase in the mean earth - moon distance _ etc _ , and these emerge as a consequence of the fact that from the astg , the orbital angular momentum is not a conserved quantity as is the case in newtonian s gravitational theory and einstein s gtr . that the orbital angular momentum is not a conserved quantity",
    "may lead one to think that the astg violets the law _ of _ conservation of angular momentum  no , this is not the case .",
    "the lost angular momentum is transferred to the spin of the orbiting body and as well as the sun .",
    "for empty space : @xmath0 ; and for a spherically symmetric setting we have @xmath36 and this leads directly to newtonian gravitation . for a scenario or setting that exhibits azimuthal symmetry such as a spinning gravitating body as the sun we must have : @xmath1",
    ", we thus shall solve the poisson equation : @xmath37 .",
    "the poisson equation for this setting is readily soluble and its solution can readily be found in most of the good textbooks of electrodynamics and quantum mechanics for example  it is instructive that we present this solution here .",
    "we shall solve poisson s equation for empty space ( @xmath0 ) exactly ; by means of separation of variables , _",
    "i.e. _ we shall set : @xmath38 .",
    "inserting this into the poisson equation we will have after some basic algebraic operations :    @xmath39    the radial and the angular portions of this equation must equal some constant since they are independent of each other .",
    "following tradition , we must set :    @xmath40    and the solution to this is :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants and @xmath44 .",
    "if we set the boundary conditions ; @xmath45 , then @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "now , just as einstein demanded of his gtr to reduce to the well known poisson equation in the low energy regime of minute curvature , we must demand that @xmath48 , in its zeroth order approximation  where @xmath49 and the terms @xmath50 are so small that they can be neglected ; the theory must reduce to newton s inverse square law ; for this to be so , we must have :    @xmath51    where @xmath35 is an infinite set of dimensionless parameters such that @xmath52 and the rest of the parameters @xmath35 for @xmath53 will take values different from unity and these constants will have  for now , until such a time that we are able to deduce them directly from theory ; to be determined from the experience of observations . in the discussion section , we shall hint at our current thinking on the nature of these constants .",
    "with this given , it means we will have :    @xmath54    now , moving onto the angular part , we will have :    @xmath55\\sin^{2}\\theta={0},\\label{theta - comp}\\ ] ]    and a solution to this is a little complicated ; it is given by the spherical harmonic function :    @xmath56    of degree @xmath47 and @xmath57 is associated legendre polynomial . as already said ,",
    "the derivation of @xmath58 just presented can be found in most good standard textbooks of quantum mechanics and classical electrodynamics . since equation ( [ theta - comp ] ) is a second order differential equation , one would naturally expect there to exist two independent solutions for every @xmath47 .",
    "it so happens that the other solutions give infinity at @xmath59 , which is physically meaningless ( see _ e.g. _ grifitts @xmath60 ) .",
    "now , putting all the things together , the most general solution is given :    @xmath61,\\label{newpot}\\ ] ]    which is a linear combination of all the solutions for @xmath47 .",
    "in the case of ordinary bodies such as the sun , the higher orders terms [ _ i.e. _ @xmath62 : of the term @xmath63 , will be small and in these cases , the gravitational field will tend to newton s gravitational theory . equation ( [ newpot ] ) is the embodiment of the astg , and from this , we shall show that one is able to explain the precession of the perihelion of planetary orbits .    in this equation [ _ i.e. _ , ( [ newpot ] ) ] , nowhere does the value of the sun s spin ( @xmath64 _ days _ ) enter into our equation .",
    "this may lead one to asking `` so where has this been taken into account ? '' . to answer this",
    ", it is important to note that if the potential is a function of @xmath21 only _ i.e. _ , @xmath36 , then , it technically is a function of @xmath21 and @xmath33 as well ( with the @xmath33-dependence being trivial ) .",
    "what this means is that spherical symmetry implies an azimuthal symmetry around any arbitrarily chosen axis . if a specific axis is singled out , _",
    "e.g. _ , by the spin of a body about the spin axis , then , the spherical symmetry of the static body is broken , and only an azimuthal symmetry remains and this azimuthal symmetry is only about the plane cutting the body into hemispheres such that this plane is normal to the spin axis .",
    "for any other plane cutting the body into hemispheres , the two hemispheres are asymmetric . from this",
    "we see that the azimuthally symmetric solution is consequence of the breaking of the spherical symmetry by the introduction of a spin axis , hence thus one is automatically lead to consider the solutions for which @xmath1 . in this way",
    ", the spin has been taken into account .",
    "[ pshift - fig ]   during each orbit .",
    "this shift is referred to as the precession of the perihelion.,title=\"fig : \" ]      we shall derive here the equations of motion for the azimuthally symmetric gravitational field , @xmath58 .",
    "we know that the force per unit mass [ or the acceleration _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 ( see any good textbook on classical mechanics ) where a single dot represents the time derivative @xmath67 and likewise a double dot presents the second time derivative @xmath68 .",
    "comparison of @xmath66 with ( @xmath69 ) ; _ i.e. _ : @xmath70 , leads to the equations :    @xmath71    for the @xmath72-component and for the @xmath73-component we will have :    @xmath74    now , taking equation ( [ eqnmotion2 ] ) and dividing throughout by @xmath75 and remembering that the specific angular momentum @xmath76 , we will have :    @xmath77    hence thus :    @xmath78    the specific orbital angular momentum is the orbital angular momentum per unit mass and unless otherwise specified , we shall refer to it as angular momentum .",
    "digressing a little : what the above equation ( [ jeqn ] ) means is that the orbital angular momentum of a planet around the sun is not a conserved quantity .",
    "if it is not conserved , then the sum of the orbital and spin angular momentum must be a conserved quantity ( if this angular momentum is not say transfered to the sun or other solar bodies ) , the meaning of which is that at the different @xmath21-positions , the spin of a planet about its own axis must vary .",
    "this could mean the length of the day must vary depending on the radial position away from the sun .",
    "we shall come to this later , all we simple want to do is to underline this , as it points to the possibility of a secular change in the mean length of the day .",
    "now moving on , if we make the transformation @xmath79 , then for @xmath80 and @xmath81 we will have :    @xmath82    respectively . inserting these into ( [ eqnmotion1 ] ) and then dividing the resultant equation by @xmath83 and remembering ( [ jeqn ] ) and also that @xmath84 , one is lead to :    @xmath85    the solutions that we shall consider are those for which @xmath33 is a time constant , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath86 and for the convenience we shall write @xmath33 with subscript @xmath87 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath88 .",
    "this is just to remind us that it ( @xmath33 ) is not a variable in the equations of motion as this is a constant for a particular planet @xmath87 , hence :    @xmath89    and :    @xmath90    this ends our derivation of the equations of motion for the field @xmath58 . before we proceed to our main task of showing how equations ( [ m1 ] and [ m2 ] )",
    "explain the precession of planetary orbits , let us  for instructive purposes , first lay down einstein s solution .",
    "when einstein applied his newly discovered gtr to the problem of the precession of the perihelion of the planet mercury he obtained that the trajectory of solar planets must be described by the equation :    @xmath91    where again @xmath79 . to obtain a solution to this equation , we note that the left hand side is the usual newtonian equation for the orbit of planets , _",
    "i.e. _ :    @xmath92    and the solution to this equation is : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the _ eccentricity _ of the orbit and @xmath95 where @xmath96 is half the size of the major axis of the ellipse . written in different form ,",
    "this solution is :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the planet s distance of closest approach to the sun [ see figure ( [ pshift - fig ] ) for an illustration ] .",
    "this solution is a good approximate solution to ( [ euorb ] ) because the orbit of mercury is nearly newtonian .",
    "consequently , we can rewrite the small term on the right hand side of ( [ euorb ] ) as : @xmath99 ; and in so doing , we make an entirely negligible error . with this substitution ( [ euorb ] )",
    "becomes :    @xmath100    and the solution to this equation is :    @xmath101,\\ ] ]    of the additional terms , the first _",
    "i.e. _ ( @xmath102 ) is a constant and the second oscillates through two cycles on each orbit ; both these terms are immeasurably small . however , the last term increases steadily in amplitude with @xmath34 , and hence with time , whilst oscillating through one cycle per orbit ; clearly this term is responsible for the precession of the perihelion . dropping all unimportant terms we will have :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is extremely small .",
    "thus all this leads us to :    @xmath105    where : @xmath106 . at the perihelion we will have :",
    "@xmath107 and this implies : @xmath108 . essentially , this means that the perihelion advances by @xmath109 per revolution and the resultant equation for the orbit is :    @xmath110    hence thus the rate of precession of the perihelion is given by :    @xmath111    this is einstein s formula derived in @xmath112 soon after he discovered the gtr .",

    "this makes the secular change a purely classical result .",
    "now , given the definition of the eccentricity of an orbit :    @xmath280    where @xmath98 and @xmath281 are the spatial extent of the minor and major axis respectively ; and then , differentiating this with respect to time , one is lead to :    @xmath282    there is no reason to assume that the rate of change of the minor and major axis be the same , thus we must set :    @xmath283    and from this it follows that :    @xmath284    and multiplying by @xmath98 both sides , and thereafter substituting @xmath285 on the right hand side we will have :    @xmath286    therefore :    @xmath287    now , on the average , the time change of the minor axis must to a large extend be a good measure of the time change of the average distance @xmath288 between the planet and the sun , hence thus :    @xmath289    in the realm of newtonian gravitation where spherical symmetry is assumed thus producing equations only dependent on the radial distance @xmath21 , the eccentricity is an absolute time constant , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath290 , and this directly leads to @xmath291 , hence when one finds that the mean earth - sun distance is increasing , it comes more as a surprise .",
    "if we consider azimuthally symmetry in poisson s equation as has been done here , the result emerges naturally because the eccentricity is expected to increase with the passage of time  this we shall demonstrate very soon .    in  ( 4 ) , against the clear message from the astg",

    "it turns out that taking this into account leads us to two type of orbits ( 1 ) spiral orbits ( 2 ) the normal elliptical orbits with the important difference that the eccentricity of these orbits varies with time and it is this variation of eccentricity that we believe the secular increase of the mean earth - sun distance is rooted .",
    "doing the right thing and taking into account the predicted change in the angular momentum , then equation ( [ orbapprox ] ) will be :    @xmath292    and taking the change of angular momentum to first order approximation from equation ( [ varday ] ) , one will have :    @xmath293u^{2}=-2\\alpha u^{2},\\label{varday2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath294 is clearly defined from this equation _",

    "we believe the assumption that @xmath311 is justified because if that was not the case , there could be an accelerated increase in the orbital angular momentum and this could have been noticed by now . in this assumption that @xmath311 , we must have @xmath305 being so small that it is not easily noticeable as it appears to be the case since we have had to relay on delicate observations to deduce the secular increase of the mean earth - sun distance .",
    "now , to obtain a solution to this equation ( _ i.e. _ [ neworb ] ) , we need first to get a solution to :    @xmath312    and to obtain a solution to this , we need first to solve :    @xmath313    and to its solution we add @xmath314 . the axillary differential equation to this differential equation is : @xmath315 and its ( _ i.e. _ equation [ orbtype2 ] ) solutions are :    @xmath316    where @xmath317 . if @xmath318 the solution is : @xmath319 where @xmath320 and @xmath321 are constants , thus adding @xmath314 we have :    @xmath322    and if @xmath323 the solution is : @xmath324 thus adding @xmath314 we have :    @xmath325    the solutions ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ sol2 ] ) are clearly spiral orbits .",
    "these solutions are obvious very interesting but because our focus is not on them , but on the solutions giving elliptical orbits in which the eccentricity varies , we shall not be looking into these spiral orbit solutions any further than we have already done .",
    "now , in the event that @xmath326 the solution to equation ( [ neworb1 ] ) is :    @xmath327    now , using the same strategy as that used in  ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to solving equations ( [ euorb ] ) and ( [ orbapprox ] ) respectively , one finds that the resultant orbit equation will be :    @xmath328}\\label{forb},\\ ] ]    and as before , at the perihelion we will have @xmath329 and this implies @xmath330^{-1}=2\\pi n[\\beta_{2}+ \\sqrt{1-\\beta_{1}-k^{2}}]^{-1}\\simeq 2\\pi n[1+(2\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1})/2-k^{2}/2]^{-1}$ ] and taking only first order terms we will have : @xmath331 $ ] and this shows that the perihelion will precess by an amount @xmath332 $ ] , and in comparison with @xmath333 $ ] obtained without taking into account the changing angular momentum , there is an additional precession of @xmath334 .",
    "the value of @xmath335 for the solar system is so small that in practice , one can neglect it , thus , we have not missed out much in our calculation in which we have assumed a constant orbital angular momentum . while this result is important our main thrust is to deduce the variation of the eccentricity of elliptical orbits ( we shall shelf any deliberations on this result for a further reading ) .    in equation ( [ forb ] ) , the term @xmath336 in the denominator is the eccentricity , let us write this as @xmath337 , and from this we see that the eccentricity varies with time  _",
    "i.e. _ ; as the orbital angular momentum changes with the passage of time , so does the eccentricity . now plucking this into equation ( [ evar ] )",
    "we can determine the variation of the mean earth - sun distance if we have knowledge of @xmath338 , _ unfortunately _ we do not have this .",
    "however , if we are to reproduce the observed variation of the earth - sun distance , one finds that if they were to set @xmath339 , which practically means that the orbit grows evenly at every point , one is able to explain the secular increase of the mean earth - sun distance .",
    "it should be said that , if the astg is to stand on its own  _",
    "i.e. _ , independent of observations , then it must be able to explain the result @xmath339 from within its own provinces .",
    "it is for this reason that we say , _ in - principle _ , the astg is able to explain the secular increase in the mean earth - sun distance and only until such a time when one is able to derive say the value @xmath339 from within the theory itself , will we be able to say the astg explains the secular increase in the earth - sun distance .",
    "other than the secular increase in the mean earth - sun distance , there is also the increase in the mean earth - moon distance .",
    "this has been measured by @xcite to be @xmath340 and in si units this is @xmath341 .",

    "we are working on these ideas to improve the astg and at present we can only say it is prudent to assume that the @xmath264-values are specific to the body in question hence one has to calculate them from observational data . for the earth , this increase in the earth - moon distance is",

    "is that , as @xmath343 , the eccentricity will decrease and the reserve is that the eccentricity will increase as @xmath344 decreases .",
    "an increasing eccentricity leads to a secular decrease in the planet - sun distance and a decreasing eccentricity leads to a secular increase in the planet - sun distance .",
    "this means the sense in which the planet orbits the sun is important ! because we believe from @xcite and @xcite , that there is a secular increase in the earth - sun distance , this means the current direction of rotation of the earth around the sun must be such that @xmath343 .",
    "this must be true for other planets rotating in the same sense as the earth ; and to any ( object in the solar system ) that rotates in the direction opposite to this , this body will experience a secular decrease in its distance from the sun .",

    "we take this as further indication that the astg contains in it , a grail of the truth .      we know that angular momentum must be conserved but according to ( [ varday ] ) , it is not conserved .",

    "_ i.e. _ @xmath375 ( which is certainly not true ) , then what we obtain from the above is a minimum value for the secular change in the sun s spin .",
    "the reason for invoking this assumption is because there currently is no information on the secular change of the sun s radius ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , hence we make this assumption so that we can proceed with our calculation .",
    "as already said , what we get is not the exact secular change in the sun s spin but a lower limit to this .    the second term in equation ( [ sspin ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath376 ; represents the effect of solar mass loss , which can be evaluated in the following way .",
    "the sun has a luminosity of at least @xmath377 , or @xmath378 ; this includes electromagnetic radiation and the contribution from neutrinos ( @xcite ) .",
    "the particle mass loss rate due to the solar wind is @xmath379 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . from this information",

    "now , the last term in equation ( [ sspin ] ) can be evaluated from the astg since @xmath305 is known  so doing , one finds that it is equal to @xmath381 ; this implies @xmath382 . this result is a significant @xmath383 times larger than the term emerging from the solar mass loss so much that we can neglect this altogether and consider only the last term in equation ( [ sspin ] ) hence @xmath382 .",
    "this value is significantly larger compared to that calculated by @xcite where these authors find a value of @xmath384 .",
    "currently , no serious measurements on the secular change in the period of the solar spin has been made .",
    "it should be possible to undertake this effort and with respect to the astg , and the result of @xcite , this experiment would act an arbiter .    furthermore , the authors @xcite propose that the sun and the earth are literally pushing each other away ( leading to the increase in the earth - sun distance ) due to their tidal interaction and they believe that this same process is what s gradually driving the moon s orbit outward : they say `` tides raised by the moon in our oceans are gradually transferring earth s rotational energy to lunar motion . as a consequence , each year",
    "the moon s orbit expands by about @xmath385 and earth s rotation slows by about @xmath386 '' .",
    "further @xcite assumes that our planet s mass is raising a tiny but sustained tidal bulge in the sun .",
    "they calculate that , thanks to earth , the sun s rotation rate is slowing by @xmath387 . thus according to their explanation ,",
    "the distance between the earth and sun is growing because the sun is losing its angular momentum ",
    "the astg gives a different explanation altogether and this is in our opinion , very interesting .",
    "we have considered poisson s equation for empty space and solved this for an azimuthally symmetric setting  we have coined the term azimuthally symmetric theory _ of _ gravitation ( astg ) for the emergent theory thereof . from the emergent solution , we have shown that the astg is capable of explaining certain observed ( and yet to be observed ) anomalies :      one of the draw - backs of the astg as it currently stands is that it is heavily dependent on observations ; _ for _ the values of @xmath35 need ( have ) to be determined from observations . without knowledge of the @xmath388 ,",
    "one is unable to produce the hard numbers required to make any quantifications .",
    "clearly , a theory incapable of making any numerical quantifications is _",

    "i.e. _ finding a general form for the constants @xmath35 ; in the subsequent paragraphs , we shall make what we believe is a _",
    "reasonable suggestion _ and give our current envisage - ment on the general form for these constants .",
    "\\(1 ) first things first , _ if _ the constants @xmath35 where all independent of each other , then , the theory would clearly be horribly complicated .",
    "if we take as guide the principle _ of _ occam s razor which in most if not all cases , leads to the simplest theory , then , these constants must be dependent on each other somehow so as to reduce the labyrinth of complications thereof .",
    "the simplest imaginable such dependence is @xmath389 ; in this way , the entire system of constants @xmath35 is dependent on just the one constant @xmath144 .",
    "this idea that the system of constants be dependent on just one constant is drawn from the theory of polynomial functions where for a polynomial function @xmath390 , one can have `` well behaved '' polynomial functions for which the constants @xmath391 have a general form ,",
    "_ i.e. _ , were they dependent on @xmath392 ; _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath393 .",
    "we envisage the function @xmath58 to be a `` well behaved '' function . by `` well behaved ''",
    "we simple mean its system of constants , @xmath35 , is critically dependent on @xmath47 just as the constants @xmath391 depend on @xmath392 .",
    "\\(2 ) second , we could like that on a practical level , only the second order approximation of the theory must suffice , this means the terms @xmath394 must be practically negligible .",
    "we have already shown herein that the second order approximation of the astg is able to explain a sizable amount of anomalous observations . with the astg written in its second order approximation and as will be shown in the second reading ( _ i.e. _ , a follow - up reading that we hope will be published in the present journal ) , one is able without much difficulties , to explain from this second order approximation , the emergence of molecular bipolar outflows in star forming systems , as a gravitational phenomena .",
    "if the other terms beyond the second order approximation become practically significant , one will have difficulties to explain outflows .",
    "so in a way , we are not going to pretend but clearly state that , we want  albeit with a priori and posteriori justification ; to fine tune the theory so that it is able to explain the emergence of bipolar .",
    "this is the strongest reason we want the terms for which @xmath394 to be so small such that in practice one can neglect them entirely .",
    "\\(3 ) third and most important , the only data point we have of these constants is the determined values for the sun , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath395 and @xmath396 .",
    "if logic is to hold  as it must ; then , our suggestion , @xmath389 ; must be able to explain this .",
    "we find that the following proposal :      meets ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",

    "further checking on ( 2 ) ; from ( [ lambda ] ) we will have @xmath399 which is practically small ; the meaning of which is that all terms for which @xmath394 can in practice be neglected entirely .    if the above proposal proves itself to be correct , then",
    ", the resultant theory will have just one undetermined parameter @xmath144 .",
    "we are not going to try and deduce what this parameter depends on but simple hint at our current thinking .",
    "we believe this parameter must depend on the angular frequency of the spin of the gravitating body in question .",
    "if we can find the correct dependence , then , the astg will stand on it own thus positioning itself on the podium to make testable predictions .",
    "we have left the task to make this deduction an exercise for the follow - up reading .",
    "the fact the we have deduced the crucial parameters @xmath146 & @xmath147 from experience , means we have in the current reading done some reserve engineering . normally , a theory must give these values and make clear predictions , just as when einstein wrote down his equations and found that his theory predicted a factor @xmath260 difference when compared to newton s theory when it come to the bending of light by the sun and when applied to the sun - mercury system , it accounted very well for the then unexplained @xmath400 per century for the precession of the perihelion of the orbit of this planet ; it just came out right .",
    "there were no free parameters that needed fitting as is the case of the astg .",
    "as argued above , once a general form for the @xmath35 is found , this setback of the astg will be solved . because we were able to obtain",
    "the values @xmath146 & @xmath147 which lead acceptable values for the perihelion precession , means that the values @xmath401 & @xmath402 are not random but systematic . if the theory was all wrong , then , only luck would make the obtained values for @xmath401 & @xmath402 give values of @xmath146 & @xmath147 such that equation ( [ simul ] ) give in general , acceptable values for the precession of the perihelion of the planets .    with regard to the values obtained for the precession of the perihelion of solar planets",
    ", it can be said that , the values obtained from the astg as shown in column 10 ( table [ pshift ] ) when weighed against the observational values listed in column 10 ( of the same table ) are acceptable .",
    "given that we have taken into account the fact the orbits of these planets are not found laying in the same plane , this can hardly be a coincident or an accident since changing their inclination by just @xmath403 will alter the predicted values of the precession of their perihelion .",
    "@xcite states that the secular increase in the mean earth - sun distance can not be explained within the realm of classical physics .",
    "contrary to this , we believe and hold that herein  we have shown from within the provinces of classical physics that this result is explainable from within the domains and confines of classical physics . before the present",
    ", the reason why perhaps this observation appeared beyond the reach of classical physics is because classical physics has not really considered gravitation as an azimuthally symmetric phenomenon as has been done in present reading .",
    "this strongly suggests that the ideas presented herein need to be explored further for they contain a debris of the truth .",
    "one of the interesting outcome that was not explored in this reading for fear of digression is that the astg has a provision for spiral orbits ( equation [ sol1 ] and [ sol2 ] ) .",
    "these orbits occur when @xmath404 .",
    "this condition implies the existence of a region ( @xmath405 ) in which spiral orbits will occur . evaluating the inequality",
    "@xmath404 , leads to : @xmath406 , and from this , it is easy for one to deduce that spiral orbits are unlikely in the solar system since these will have to occur inside the sun because @xmath407 .    at this point",
    "as we approach the end of this reading , we feel strongly that we must address the question ; `` does the spin along the azimuthal axis of a gravitating body induce an azimuthal symmetry into the gravitational field for this spinning body ? '' to answer this , we must ask the question ; `` will a contracting none - spinning cloud of gas experience any bulge alone its equator ? ''",
    "first , we know that the equatorial bulge will occur on a plane perpendicular to the spin axis . since a none - spinning gas cloud is going to have to spin axis , there is going to be no spin axis about which the equatorial bulge will occur .",
    "if the material in the cloud is randomly and uniformly distributed , the cloud will exhibit a spherically symmetric distribution of mass and its gravitational field is expected to be spherically symmetric .",
    "a spherically spherically symmetric gravitational field is one that only has a radial dependence , _ i.e. _ @xmath408 .",
    "now , if the gas cloud is spinning , the centrifugal forces will cause there to exist a disk and the material distribution will have an azimuthal symmetry , _ i.e_. @xmath409 .",
    "should not this azimuthal symmetric distribution of matter induce an azimuthal gravitational field ? from poison s equation ( [ poison ] ) , @xmath409 implies @xmath1 ; should not this , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath1 , hold as - well for a body spinning gravitating body in a vacuum ? from this , clearly , a spinning gravitating body ought to exhibit an azimuthal symmetry .",
    "we have argued in the last paragraph of  ( 2 ) that the spin of a gravitating body breaks the existing spherical symmetry of the non - spinning body and the above argument is just adding more to this .",
    "it is from this that the subtitle and running head finds its justification .",
    "if the astg turns out to be correct  as we believe it will ; then , we have an important question to ask ;  what is the speed of light doing in a theory of gravitation because from ( [ bdef ] ) we see that the constants @xmath410 and @xmath411 are intimately tied - up together ? this is a similar if not a congruent question that has been asked by @xcite in their expository work on earth flyby anomalies ( afa ) .",
    "the empirical formula deduced to quantify efa contains in it the speed of light , @xmath411 , so in their exposition of the phenomena of afa , @xcite have asked the perdurable question `` what is the speed of light doing there ? '' .",
    "efa are thought to be a gravitational phenomena , so , what does the speed of light have to do with gravitation  _ really _ ? if there is an intimate relationship between the speed of light and gravitation , then , one will be forgiven to think this suggests a link between gravitation and the theory of light ",
    "the speed of light , @xmath411 , appears to be dire to the astg presented herein .",
    "why not another value but the speed of light , @xmath411 ?",
    "we shall leave these matters hanging in - limbo .    in relation to the question above , _",
    "i.e. _ , `` what is the speed of light doing in a theory of gravitation '' , one notes that newtonian gravitation  which requires instantaneous interaction as a postulate ; does not imply the dependence of the gravitational potential on the azimuthal angle for a spinning body as is the case in the astg , because at any instant @xmath412 , the gravitating body appears spherically symmetric .",
    "here we have the speed of light @xmath411 coming in because of the azimuthal symmetry .",
    "does this speed of light @xmath411 link ( or not ) the propagation of the gravitational phenomena to the speed of light ? in the present , we can only pause this as a question , for we still have to do further work on these ideas .    in closing ,",
    "allow me to say that we find it hard to call what has been presented herein as `` a new theory _ of _ gravitation '' .",
    "when one tells you they have come up with a new theory of gravitation , what immediately comes to mind is that they have discovered a new principle upon which gravitation can further be understood from the present understanding . the astg is not founded on any new physical principle but on the well known vintage equation of poisson .",
    "what we have done is simply taken the azimuthally symmetric equations of this equation and applied them to gravitation .",
    "based on this understanding , it is difficult to call it a new theory .",
    ", the azimuthally symmetric equations of poisson have brought new and exciting physics  perhaps only because of this , the title of this reading finds its qualification .",

    "<S> further , we show that the theory is able to explain at a satisfactory level the observed secular increase earth year ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) . furthermore , we show that the theory makes a significant and testable prediction to the effect that the period of the solar spin must be decreasing at a rate of at least @xmath5 .    </S>",
