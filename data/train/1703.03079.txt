    "<S> we extend the effective theory approach to the ideal fluid limit where the polarization of the fluid is non - zero . after describing and motivating the equations of motion @xcite , </S>",

    "<S> we discuss how the presence of polarization affects the stability and causality of the ideal fluid limit .    </S>",
    "<S> relativistic hydrodynamics is an area which currently enjoys a high level of both theoretical and phenomenological activity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> heavy ion collision experiments have been shown to be well described by hydrodynamic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the connection of hydrodynamics to microscopic theory , and the development of hydrodynamics as an effective field theory , are however still not well understood .    the direct observation of polarization of @xmath0 particles in heavy ion collisions @xcite and microscopic strongly coupled systems @xcite , as well as phenomena such as chiral transport and anomalies </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has motivated the phenomenological study of vorticiity in relativistic fluids @xcite and its relationship to microscopic spin polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> a `` realistic '' effective theory for describing the relationship between vorticity and polarization in the ideal fluid limit is however still in development . </S>",
    "<S> vorticity does not emerge in the transport limit , but rather close to the thermodynamic / hydrodynamic regime . </S>",
    "<S> the former was studied within the usual thermodynamic techniques , updated with the inclusion of angular momentum @xcite , but this is not a realistic setup for a strongly coupled dynamical system , where equilibrium is to a good approximation local rather than global .    </S>",
    "<S> the authors in @xcite used a cooper - frye formula extended to spinor observables , assuming polarization is zero before freezeout . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption however violates detailed balance across the freezeout hypersurface @xcite . if hadrons after freeze - out carry both vorticity and spin polarization , then so must the microscopic constituents during the evolution of the fluid @xcite and the backreaction needs to be taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem here is a conceptual one : if one defines the ideal fluid limit in terms of isotropy of the comoving frame @xcite , the transfer of angular momentum to spin is forbidden , or at least dictated by the coarse - graining scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the local hydrostatic limit in the presence of angular momentum and spin explicitly necessitates of such an anisotropy @xcite , for the maximum entropy state for a medium where microscopic degres of freedom have spin generally has polarization @xcite . and , of course , vorticity , the conserved current of the diffeomorphism invariance within perfect fluid dynamics @xcite , is be broken @xcite if angular momentum can be transferred to local polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> usual insights from transport theory can be misleading since polarization is a breakdown of molecular chaos , since it is a two - particle microscopic phase space correlation @xcite . to overcome this , one needs the effective field theory approach , succesfully used to both define ideal @xcite and dissipative @xcite hydrodynamics : one writes down hydrodynamics in lagrangian form , and treats the microscopic scale as an effective planck constant and develops fluctuation - driven terms within the effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , however , polarization requires the inroduction of additional degrees of freedom , which explicitly break isotropy . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we constructed such a theory . </S>",
    "<S> we shall briefly introduce it and examine its behavior close to hydrostatic equilibrium .    in this </S>",
    "<S> approach perfect fluid without polarization can be described by three fields , representing the comoving (  lagrangian  ) coordinate systems @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> fluidity can be defined via symmetries , namely the invariance of the lagrangian under a volume - preserving diffeomorphism invariance @xcite . in general @xmath2=1\\ ] ] it directly follows @xcite that the lagrangian is of the form , at the lowest order in gradients @xmath3}{\\phantom{a},\\phantom{a}}b_{ij}=\\partial_\\mu \\phi_i \\partial^\\mu \\phi_j\\ ] ] the lagrangian above straight - forwardly yields the general energy momentum tensor whose conservation yields euler s equations @xcite , @xmath4 if one substitutes , for energy density @xmath5 , pressure @xmath6 and chemical potential @xmath7 @xmath8 the latter , defined in terms of an internal @xmath9 conserved current @xmath10 and the chemical shift symmetry @xcite @xmath11 to be @xmath12 the lagrangian in general is related to the free energy by a legendre transformation w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the diffeomorphism symmetries and the chemical shift allow for a uniquely defined flow velocity @xmath13 with the comoving projector being @xmath14 if the system has intrinsic polarization , the coordinates @xmath15 are not enough because they do not contain information about polarization . moreover , because of the conceptual difficulties described earlier , we need to define precisely what we mean by the ideal hydrodynamic limit , especially because of the polarizations breaking of local isotropy and vorticity conservation . </S>",
    "<S> we take the ideal hydrodynamic limit to mean that dynamics is dependent only on the flow @xmath16 and comoving variables , the comoving variables are defined entirely by local entropy maximization , and that only sound waves and vortices arise as local excitations@xcite .    regarding the polarization effective degrees of freedom @xmath17 , </S>",
    "<S> they have been defined in ref  @xcite as the ( infinitesimal ) volume integral of the total angular momentum of a fluid cell in the local comoving frame , normalized using the volum of the cell itself . </S>",
    "<S> this can be interpreted as a way to keep track of the angular momentum structure of the fluid during a coarse graining procedure . </S>",
    "<S> angular momentum conservation has always been considered in relativistic hydrodynamics , therefore no new symmetry has to be added , only the new polarization degrees of freedom : the lack of a spin tensor and the symmetry of the stress - energy tensor imply local angular momentum conservation both for ideal and viscous hydrodynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> if the polarization were `` passively transported along the fluid '' , in other worlds , if polarization were conserved , then one wold need an additional symmetry on the effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is similar to the _ actual _ @xmath9 symmetry considered in ref  @xcite , where the phase invariance , represented by an explicit dependence of the lagrangian on the gradient of the local phase , was not enough to recover ideal ( non - polarized ) hydrodynamics , because the electric current is not guaranteed to be proportional to the energy flux . to enforce this requirement </S>",
    "<S> one can introduce the concept of shift symmetry , which can be interpreted as an invariance of physics under local rescaling of the electric charge units . </S>",
    "<S> if one uses the same formalism to describe the flow of the spin current ( @xmath18 in the comoving frame ) , one would have    @xmath19    which would represent , not only the invariance of physics under rescaling of the polarization units , but also invariance under an arbitrary addition of an extra polarization which is constant along the flux lines . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , the invariant that should enter the effective lagrangian is @xmath20 if we apply the `` revised '' chemical shift  ( [ rev_chem_shift ] ) , @xmath21 is invariant since @xmath22 will enter in the derivative and annihillate with @xmath23 is vanishing by construction .    </S>",
    "<S> conservation of angular momentum , even in the ideal limit , does not imply that polarization should correspond to an even approximatel conserved current . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore treat @xmath18 as an auxiliary field distinct from @xmath24 , and impose the interaction between orbital and spin angular momentum via the equation of state . in order for local equilibrium to be well - defined , we chose to write directly the polarization degrees as proportional to the local vorticity </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath25 a violation of this condition will inevitably result in goldstone modes and topological constraints which create long - term correlations which make a hydrodynamic limit impossible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that in an external field such as ( but not only ) magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , this symmetry would be broken and the lagrangian would depend directly on polarization . </S>",
    "<S> in general one expects a lagrangian which depends on @xmath21 , @xmath17 and mixed terms all together .    by counting gradients and enforcing symmetries , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest order term which respects the internal diffeomorphism symmetry is @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> for example @xmath27 $ ] is a higher term in gradient ( @xmath28 being proportional to the vorticity , which is a gradient ) , @xmath29 would violate parity and @xmath30 be higher order in gradient , again . </S>",
    "<S> parity violating terms would of course be permitted in the context of anomalous hydrodynamics ) . considering that polarization introduces a correlation between microstates , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of polarization at a given entropy @xmath31 should change the free energy , to leading order in gradient , as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a dimensionful constant representing polarizeability ( it can be positive for a ferromagnetic material and negative for an antiferromagnetic one ) . for dimensional reasons , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 given this , a physically reasonable way to introduce polarization that we adopted is @xmath35 for instance , the ideal gas without polarization with density @xmath36 of particles of which a fraction @xmath37 are polarized , assuming nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , making @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now make the link between the lagrangian formulation and usual thermodynamics using the methods of @xcite but with the angular momentum in lieu of chemical potential ( note that the collinearity between angular momentum and polarization is what makes this analogy possible ) . while physically , because of lack of isotropy it is non - trivial to relate the usual derivatives of the free energy to what we know as pressure and energy density , the existence of some free energy @xmath41 to be minimized will lead to a constraint of the type @xmath42 which allows us to link the constant of proportionality in eq . </S>",

    "<S> if we had @xmath41 in terms of a partition function we could find @xmath44 given a local temperature and vorticity explicitly , via a derivation along the lines of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the qcd equation of state dependence on angular momentum , necessary to calculate @xmath44 , is as yet unknown , but it should be strictly related to the equation of state at finite magnetic field by the amount of angular momentum carried by that magnetic field .    </S>",

    "<S> in addition to generally breaking homogeneity and vorticity conservation , unlike non - polarized hydrodynamics the higher gradient in velocity dependence these equations will be higher than 2nd order in gradient . to understand the consequences of this , we linearized the hydrostatic limit with `` temperature '' @xmath53 , @xmath54 not that this is not the actual temperature of the background , it is proportional to that only in the conformal limit . using the notation in @xcite , where @xmath55 is shorthand for @xmath56 and @xmath57 $ ] for its trace and time derivatives are denoted by dots , the non - polarized hydrodynamics gives the usual wave equation for sound waves , the stationary vortex state polarization terms which will increase the gradients at each order by one unit . </S>",

    "<S> the two solutions for @xmath68 are    @xmath69    note that , depending on the parameters and on the momentum scale , this can be complex . </S>",
    "<S> an imaginary part to the frequency corresponds to damped modes and instabilities .    applying the machinery to the transverse modes we get    @xmath70    </S>",
    "<S> there is always a couple of non hydrodynamic modes associated withe the vorticous excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions for @xmath71 are    @xmath72    we have calculated the maximum possible wave velocity for @xmath73 numerically , and it is shown as a function of the coefficients in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dispersion ]    on the one hand , as one can see , polarization has important consequences on vortex non - propagation @xcite . for a general equation of state , a change in temperature due to the propagation of a sound wave will also change the susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> because of conservation of angular momentum , this will also change the vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> this mixing between sound waves and vortices due to the sensitivity of the equation of state to polarization will allow vortices to propagate and create an effective hydrostatic limit even in the hydrodynamic limit in the presence of fluctuations , which could lead to stabilization @xcite for small vorticities , the `` fluctuation - driven turbulence '' phase conjectured in @xcite . on the other hand , the ideal hydrodynamic limit also leads to a non - causal propagation for both sound and group velocity , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dispersion ] where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are systematically varied , and @xmath76 is maximized . for all significant values ( @xmath77 ) of these parameters , @xmath76 goes significantly above the causal limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is actually a reasonable result , as it is a direct consequence of the fact that the free energy @xmath41 , and hence the local dynamics , is sensitive to an accelleration ( similar non - causal dissipative violations of propagation were found at higher gradient order in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> ostrogradski s theorem guarantees such lagrangians are unstable ( and one needs the lagrangian picture to see this instability ) , and hence hydrodynamic systems including a response to angular momentum in the eos will not have a stable ideal hydrodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> additional terms in the lagrangian depending on @xmath24 only generally do not change this conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> one would need then to take into account the polarization as a separate dynamical degree of freedom from the vorticity and include @xmath21 ( and @xmath17 since polarization is not a conserved quantity ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this way it is possible to obtain an israel - stewart type equation @xmath78 which could resolve this issue , with an appropriate relaxation time @xmath79 , like it did for first order viscous hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure to use is similar to what has already been done in ref  @xcite to insert a relaxation time equation for the pressure correction , however it is important to remind that the current formalism used is incompatible with dissipative processes ( indeed any time irreversible process ) , and it must be extended as it was done in ref  @xcite itself . </S>",
    "<S> it is mandatory to double the degrees of freedom ( or double the time dimension , with the average of the two time coordinates as the physical time ) in order to theoretically justify an effective lagrangian as the leftover of the underlying ( full ) lagrangian , after `` integrating out '' the microscopic degrees of freedom . in this extended formalism angular momentum ( and </S>",
    "<S> in fact even four - momentum ) conservation has to be enforced on the with additional conditions , fore more informations on the subject see , for instance ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this is very different from ideal spinless hydrodynamics , where navier - stokes equations necessitate of relaxation dynamics but euler equations are well - defined . in hydrodynamics with polarization , there seems to be a general conflict between causality and the non - dissipative regime , one which might lead to a quantitative lower limit for dissipation ( the @xmath80 needed to restore causality ) in systems whose fundamental constituents have spin . </S>",
    "<S> this will be quantitatively examined in a subsequent work .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we took the effective theory for ideal hydrodynamics in the presence of polarization , linearized it under hydrostatic equilibrium and examined the behavior of the lowest - lying modes , sound wave and vortical . unlike in normal ideal hydrodynamics , the two mix . on the one hand , this is likely to stabilize the vortex mode by adding an effective soft energy gap to it . on the other , causality of sound propagation </S>",
    "<S> is no longer guaranteed even in the ideal limit unless polarization effects are soft enough . fixing this </S>",
    "<S> most likely requires introducing relaxation ( israel - stewart ) type dynamics already from the ideal fluid limit , and this has implications for the minimum viscosity for fluids whose microscopic degrees of freedom have non - zero spin . </S>"
