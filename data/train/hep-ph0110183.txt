    "the violation of cp symmetry can be explained in the standard model [ 1 ] in terms of a complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix [ 2 ] for the mixing of the quark weak eigenstates .",
    "meanwhile , in principle cp symmetry may be violated through the mixing between the scalar higgs boson and the pseudoscalar one in the neutral higgs sector of the models with at least two higgs doublets [ 3 ] . in practice in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) [ 4 ] , which has just two higgs doublets ,",
    "neither explicit nor spontaneous cp violation is found to be possible at the tree level , because the complex phase can always be eliminated by rotating the higgs fields .    in the mssm ,",
    "explicit cp violation is viable through the radiatively corrected higgs potential [ 5 ] . in explicit cp violation scenario ,",
    "the presence of cp phase at the 1-loop level in the mssm leads to significant modifications to both the higgs boson mass and the mixing among them , as radiative corrections due to the third generation quark and scalar quark loops become important .",
    "recently , the mssm searches for explicit cp violation were extended to radiative corrections due to the @xmath0 boson , the charged higgs boson , and the chargino contributions [ 6 ] .",
    "the radiative corrections from those loops have been estimated to be significant to the mixing among the neutral higgs bosons , especially if the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) between two higgs doublets is large [ 6 ] .",
    "also cp symmetry in the mssm can be spontaneously broken in the framework of the radiatively corrected higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "however , the spontaneous cp violation is disfavored because it leads to a very light neutral higgs boson , which has already been ruled out by the higgs search at the cern @xmath1 collider lep2 [ 7 ] .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm can be extended by adding neutral higgs singlet fields in addition to two higgs doublets [ 8 ] .",
    "the simplest extention of the mssm is next to the mssm ( nmssm ) .",
    "it might as well be called the ( m+1)ssm [ 8 ] . the primary motivation for the ( m+1)ssm is that this model can avoid the so - called @xmath2-problem in the mssm .",
    "thus , while the mssm introduces by hand the dimensional @xmath2 parameter , the ( m+1)ssm can generate the corresponding quantity dynamically by means of the vev of the neutral higgs singlet field .    for cp violation",
    ", it has been found that , unlike the mssm , the ( m+1)ssm may at the tree level violate cp symmetry explicitly . by assuming the degeneracy of the scalar top quark masses in the higgs sector of the ( m+1)ssm",
    ", it is found that large explicit cp violation may be realized as the vev of the neutral higgs singlet approaches to the electroweak scale [ 9 ] . at the 1-loop level , in the ( m+1)ssm",
    ", the effects of explicit cp violation to the neutral and charged higgs boson masses are investigated by taking radiative corrections due to the quarks and scalar quarks of the third generation into account [ 10 ] .",
    "we have elsewhere extended by including the contributions of the loops of the @xmath0 boson , the charged higgs boson , and the charginos to the neutral higgs boson masses as well as the mixing among them , where the production cross sections for the neutral higgs bosons are calculated via the higgs - strahlung process at future @xmath3 linear collisions when the lightest neutral higgs boson is dominantly composed of the singlet field [ 11 ] .",
    "meanwhile , it has been discovered that spontaneous cp violation can not be invoked at the tree level in the ( m+1)ssm , if the stability of the vacuum of the ( m+1)ssm should be ensured [ 12 ] .",
    "this situation has not been improved by including radiative corrections arising from the degenerate scalar top quark masses [ 13 ] .",
    "more precisely , in this case , the cp violating minima are possible only when @xmath4 is very small for @xmath5 = 1 , and thus two neutral higgs bosons becomes very light . in the higgs sector of the ( m+1)ssm , spontaneous cp violation",
    "may be realized by virtue of radiative corrections when the mass splitting effects between the scalar top quarks are taken into account [ 14 ] .",
    "summing up , it has been discovered that spontaneous cp violation is not allowed at the tree level for either the mssm or the ( m+1)ssm .",
    "furthermore , these situations have not been improved at the 1-loop level by taking into account the contributions of the degenerate scalar top quark masses .",
    "quite naturally , we would like to extend the models further to see if cp symmetry might be violated spontaneously at the tree level or at the 1-loop level .",
    "hence we add one more neutral higgs singlet field to the ( m+1)ssm , to build a model of two higgs doublets and two higgs singlets .",
    "it may be called the ( m+2)ssm .    in this paper , we investigate whether cp symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the higgs potential of the ( m+2)ssm . to explore the implication of spontaneous cp violation on the ( m+2)ssm in more detail , we concentrate on the case in which the scalar quarks of the third generation become degenerate in their masses .",
    "we investigate whether spontaneous cp violation can be realized for the higgs sector of the ( m+2)ssm in the case with radiative effects of the degenerate scalar quark masses .",
    "we would not consider explicit cp violation scenario in the higgs potential of the ( m+2)ssm .",
    "thus , we assume that all the relevant parameters in its higgs potential are real . on the other hand , in order to realize spontaneous cp violation in the higgs potential , the vevs of the two higgs doublets as well as of the two higgs singlets are assumed to be complex .",
    "we describe the tree - level higgs potential of the ( m+2)ssm in spontaneous cp violation scenario .",
    "since in supersymmetric models the contribution of radiative corrections is important for studying the higgs sector , we calculate the neutral higgs boson masses as well as the mixing among them by using the 1-loop effective potential with the contributions of the degenerate scalar quark masses in the context of the ( m+2)ssm .",
    "we find that spontaneous cp violation is possible for the wide parameter space of the considered higgs potential of the ( m+2)ssm without contradicting the phenomenological constraints set by the experimental data of lep2 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the higgs potential of the ( m+2)ssm at the tree level and the 1-loop effective potential with the contribution of the degenerate scalar quark masses . in the third section",
    ", we calculate the ( m+2)ssm higgs boson masses in spontaneous cp violation sceanrio by considering the negative experimental results on the higgs search at lep2 .",
    "conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "appexdix supplies the formulae for the elements of the neutral higgs boson mass matrix .",
    "the higgs sector of the ( m+2)ssm contains two higgs doublets and two higgs singlets .",
    "let us introduce them : @xmath6 = ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 = ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) are the higgs doublets , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two higgs singlets .",
    "they will yield seven neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the most general form of the higgs superpotential of the ( m+2)ssm , containing the term with the quark yukawa couplings for the third generation , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the usual antisymmetric 2 @xmath16 2 matrix with @xmath17 = 1 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 = 1 ,  2 ) are dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "the superfield @xmath21 = ( @xmath22 ) consists of the left - handed quarks of the third generation .",
    "the superfields @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the charge conjugate of the right - handed quarks of the third generation .",
    "note that all quark and lepton yukawa couplings except for those of the third generation quarks are neglected .",
    "the presence of the cubic terms of the higgs singlets in the above superpotential breaks a global u(1 ) peccei - quinn symmetry which leads to a pseudo - goldstone boson at the tree level [ 15 ] .    from the above superpotential ,",
    "the relevant tree - level higgs potential in the ( m+2)ssm is obtained as @xmath25 where @xmath26 terms , @xmath27 terms , and soft terms are given as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauge coupling costants , respectively , @xmath31 are the pauli matrices , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 = 1 , 2 ) in the soft terms are the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking masses , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath20 = 1 , 2 ) are the trilinear soft susy breaking parameters with mass dimension . in supersymmetric models , the most important contributions to the 1-loop effective potential come from the loops of the quarks and scalar quarks of the third generation . neglecting the mixing in the scalar quark mass matrix [ 13 , 16 ] ,",
    "the 1-loop effective potential is given as [ 17 ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the renormalization scale in the modified minimal substraction ( @xmath39 ) scheme and the soft susy breaking masses satisfy @xmath40 = @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 = @xmath47 @xmath42 @xmath48 @xmath44 @xmath49 .",
    "thus the full higgs potential @xmath50 is composed of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in this model ,",
    "the charged higgs sector automatically conserves cp . under reasonable assumptions , either explicit cp violation or spontaneous",
    "one can occur in the neutral higgs sector through the mixing of the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons .",
    "we prohibit the possibility of explicit cp violation in the above higgs sector .",
    "thus all the dimensionless coupling constants and the trilinear soft susy breaking parameters in the higgs potential are assumed to be real . for simplicity , we assume here that some of the parameters satisfy the following relations : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus at the tree level @xmath59 and @xmath60 have same values .",
    "of course the two soft susy breaking masses can take as different values . at the 1-loop level ,",
    "the values of @xmath60 deviate from those of @xmath59 by considering radiative effects of the degenerate scalar quark masses .",
    "let us first consider the case of cp conservation . in this case",
    ", the higgs potential should be such that the vevs of the four neutral higgs fields are all real : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "as is well known , the charged higgs fields do not develop the vevs because the u(1 ) gauge symmetry has to be guaranteed in the vacuum .",
    "the four neutral scalar higgs bosons can be distinguished from the three neutral pseudoscalar ones , as there is no mixing between them in the case of cp conservation . among the four neutral scalar higgs bosons , the one that has the smallest mass",
    "is referred to as the lightest scalar higgs boson .",
    "the upper bound on its mass is expressed as @xmath65 where the ratio of the vevs of the two higgs doublets is given by @xmath5 and the neutral gauge boson mass is defined as @xmath66 = @xmath67 with @xmath68 = @xmath69 = 175 gev .",
    "note that the above expression does not depend both on the vevs of the neutral higgs singlets and on the renormalization scale . in the above formula ,",
    "the last two terms come from radiative corrections due to the degenerate scalar quark masses .",
    "if cp symmetry is conserved in the higgs sector , the tree - level upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass depends critically on the sizes of @xmath18 ( @xmath34 = 1 , 2 ) .",
    "notice that the above expression is essentially equal to the upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass of the ( m+1)ssm .",
    "thus , even though an additional higgs singlet is present in higgs sector of the ( m+2)ssm , the upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass is essentially the same as the corresponding one in the ( m+1)ssm .    now , consider the case of spontaneous cp violation in the ( m+2)ssm . in order to accommodate spontaneous cp violation in the higgs sector",
    ", we have to allow complex values for the vevs of the four neutral higgs fields as @xmath70 where we take @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) to be real and positive .",
    "the conditions that the higgs potential becomes minimum at @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 yield four constraints , which can eliminate the soft susy breaking masses @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 from the potential @xmath50 .    by redefining the overall phase of the higgs potential , a combination of the four complex phases can be absorbed away , leaving three independent combinations of the phases .",
    "they may be chosen to be @xmath80 note that there is no relative phase among the vevs in @xmath52 . as the higgs potential at the tree level evokes the spontaneous cp violation , the vacuum of the model has to be defined as a stationary point with respect to the three physical cp violating phases , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "the minimum condition for the vacuum with respect to @xmath81 yields @xmath84 while the remaining two minimum conditions for a vacuum with respect to @xmath82 and @xmath83 may be arranged to yield expressions for @xmath85 and @xmath86 as @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 in order words , the three minimum equations with respect to @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 determine @xmath90 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "they are thus no longer independent parameters but dependent on others as given in the above expressions , determined by the solutions of the above three minimum equations .",

    "the mass of the charged higgs boson is thus obtained as @xmath107 where the charged gauge boson mass is defined as @xmath108 = @xmath109 .",
    "the tree - level mass of the charged higgs boson is not changed by taking into account radiative corrections due to the degeneracy of scalar quark masses .",
    "note that complex phases enter into the charged higgs boson mass .",
    "this is remarkable because spontaneous cp violation does not occur in the charged higgs sector but in the neutral higgs sector .",
    "as mentioned before , the charged higgs sector has an intact cp symmetry since the pair of the charged higgs bosons are cp - even .",
    "hence , we might say that the effect of the spontaneous cp violation in the neutral higgs sector is transferred or shifted to the charged higgs sector .",
    "the shift effect on the mass of the charged higgs boson would vanish if cp symmetry is conserved in the neutral higgs sector , _",
    "i.e. _ , if @xmath81 = @xmath82 = @xmath83 = 0 .",
    "then we have @xmath110 which may further be reduced to the tree - level mass of the charged higgs boson in the ( m+1)ssm with cp conservation , if the relevant parameters are set as @xmath4 = @xmath92 , @xmath111 = @xmath91 , @xmath112 = @xmath90 = @xmath93 , and @xmath113/2 = @xmath76 = @xmath77 .",

    "the only modification to the tree - level mass matrix for the neutral higgs boson is @xmath115    in the cp conserving limit , when @xmath81 = @xmath82 = @xmath83 = 0 , the mixing elements among the scalar components and the pseudoscalar ones in the neutral higgs boson mass matrix , @xmath116 ( @xmath34 = 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , and @xmath117 = 3 , 6 , 7 ) are zero . then , @xmath116 ( @xmath20 = 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ) become the elements of the neutral scalar higgs boson mass matrix while @xmath116 ( @xmath20 = 3 , 6 , 7 ) become those of the neutral pseudoscalar higgs boson one . in general , because the complex phases are nonzero in spontaneous cp violation scenario , @xmath116 ( @xmath34 = 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , and @xmath117 = 3 , 6 , 7 ) are nonvanishing .    consider , for example , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . @xmath118 describes the mixing between @xmath101 and @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , @xmath119 describes the mixing between @xmath102 and @xmath98 .",
    "we can reexpress @xmath118 by substituting the minimum condition for @xmath90 into it as @xmath120 and similarly for @xmath119 by exchanging @xmath121 .",
    "one can easily notice that the source of nonzero @xmath118 or @xmath119 is @xmath122 + h.c .",
    "terms in @xmath123 of the tree - level higgs potential .",
    "therefore , the situation is different from the ( m+1)ssm , where the scalar - pseudoscalar mixings do not occur in any of the two higgs doublets at the tree - level ( m+1)ssm . we would like to emphasize that in the ( m+2)ssm there exists scalar - pseudoscalar mixings even at the tree level by the minimum conditions . in other words , if the higgs potential of the ( m+2)ssm at the tree level is such that the vevs of four neutral higgs fields are complex , the mixings between scalar and pseudoscalar higgs fields would take place generally , which implies the occurrence of the spontaneous cp violation .",
    "now , we have to check if our model is phenomenologically acceptable . that is , according to either or not the model possess a significantly large region in its parameter space that is consistent with the present phenomenology , the model becomes either physical or merely mathematical , respectively . for this purpose",

    "we fix @xmath43 and @xmath48 in the effective potential at 1000 gev .",

    "we find that the masses of neutral higgs bosons as well as the charged higgs boson mass are positive for the most part of the parameter space of the ( m+2)ssm that we consider .",
    "consequently , we note that no serious reduction occurs in the considered parameter space by either the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking or the minimum conditions for the vacuum .",
