    "on the largest scales we can observe , our universe has a remarkably simple structure .",
    "it is homogeneous , isotropic , and spatially flat to very high accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the primordial curvature fluctuations which seeded the formation of structure apparently took an extremely minimal form : a statistically homogeneous , gaussian - distributed pattern of very small - amplitude curvature perturbations , with an almost perfectly scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "while inflationary models are capable of fitting the data , it is nonetheless tempting to look for a simpler and more fundamental explanation .",
    "the early universe was dominated by radiation , a form of matter without an intrinsic scale .",
    "in fact , it is believed that any well - defined quantum field theory must possess a uv fixed point , signifying conformal invariance at high energies .",
    "these lines of argument encourage us to investigate a minimal early universe cosmology , namely a quantum universe filled with conformally invariant matter  @xcite .",
    "we start by studying the quantum propagation of homogeneous background universes , uncovering a number of surprising features .",
    "then , we include inhomogeneous perturbations , treated semiclassically and perturbatively at both linear and nonlinear order .",
    "we shall not , in this paper , propose a realistic scenario .",
    "nor shall we proceed far enough to study the effects of renormalization and the running of couplings , although these are no doubt important .",
    "our focus will be on the technical calculation of the causal ( feynman ) propagator in some specific ( and quasi - realistic ) cosmologies .",
    "we shall also postpone a discussion of the important question of the _ interpretation _ of the propagator and its use to compute probabilities to future work . nevertheless , we believe our findings are instructive and form a useful starting point for such investigations .",
    "the simplest example of conformal matter is a perfect fluid of radiation . in the context of cosmology , this is extremely well - motivated since the early universe was , we believe , radiation - dominated .",
    "furthermore , if we add a single scalar field then at least at a classical level , minimal coupling is equivalent to conformal coupling under field redefinitions .",
    "so this case too may be considered as an example of conformal matter .",
    "it is then instructive to extend the discussion to include an arbitrary number of conformally and minimally coupled free scalar fields .",
    "since the matter lagrangian of interest is , by assumption , conformally ( weyl ) invariant at a classical level , it makes sense to  lift \" general relativity ( gr ) to a larger theory possessing the same symmetry .",
    "this is done by introducing an extra scalar field which is locally a pure gauge degree of freedom .",
    "the full theory is now classically weyl invariant and it may be viewed with advantage in various weyl gauges .",
    "its solutions contain all solutions of gr but the theory allows for extended and more general solutions that do not possess a global gauge - fixing to gr . in particular , it turns out that while classical cosmological ( homogeneous and isotropic ) background solutions are typically singular and geodesically incomplete in einstein gauge ( the weyl gauge in which the gravitational action takes einstein - hilbert form , with a fixed newton s gravitational constant @xmath0 ) , they are regular and geodesically complete in a more general class of weyl gauges , where @xmath0 is no longer constant and can even change sign . in these gauges , generic cosmological background solutions",
    "pass smoothly through the  big bang singularity \" and into new regions of field space , including",
    " antigravity \" regions where @xmath0 is negative  @xcite . strictly speaking , the  lifted \" classical theory is still incomplete because these highly symmetrical backgrounds are unstable to perturbations in the collapsing phase , leading to diverging anisotropies which can not be removed via a weyl gauge choice .",
    "it was argued nevertheless that the classical theory possesses a natural continuation across singularities of this kind  @xcite .    in this paper , following @xcite , we take a different tack .",
    "we ask whether _ quantum _ effects might rescue the theory from its breakdown at  big bang \"- type singularities .",
    "first , we show that for the simplest types of conformal matter , the feynman propagator for cosmological backgrounds may be computed exactly , allowing us to explore many issues with precision in this symmetry - reduced ( minisuperspace ) context .",
    "second , we extend the discussion to include anisotropies , resolving the ordering problems in the quantum ( wheeler - dewitt ) hamiltonian by imposing covariance under field redefinitions .",
    "we go further than the treatment of @xcite by defining the quantum theory along the real axis in superspace , and discovering some remarkable features . for a flat , isotropic universe ,",
    "quantum effects indeed become large near the singularity . therefore , strictly speaking , one should not attempt to employ the real classical theory there . instead , one can solve the quantum wheeler - dewitt - type equation for the propagator in complexified superspace , along a contour which avoids the singularity in taking one from the incoming collapsing universe to the outgoing expanding one .",
    "provided the contour stays sufficiently far from the singularity , the semiclassical approximation remains valid all along it , so one can employ _ complex _ solutions of the classical theory to follow the quantum evolution across ( or more accurately , around ) the singularity . in doing so , we find that while quantum effects are large near the singularity , they take a very special form such that they are ",
    "invisible \" in the evolution between incoming and outgoing states . in the final section of this paper ,",
    "we treat inhomogeneous perturbations , at linear and nonlinear order , showing how they may be followed smoothly and unambiguously across ( or , more accurately , around ) the big bang singularity , in a similar manner .",
    "the theory we consider consists of einstein gravity plus radiation and a number of free scalar fields .",
    "all of these forms of matter satisfy the strong energy condition , and any cosmological solution necessarily possesses a big bang singularity .",
    "however , there is no singularity in the feynman propagator for closed , open and flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) and for flat , anisotropic bianchi i cosmologies ; the propagator is well - behaved across a  bounce \" representing a transition from a large , collapsing classical universe to a large , expanding one .",
    "we also study inhomogeneous perturbations of the isotropic , radiation - dominated universe , studying the propagation of scalar and tensor perturbations across the bounce , at linear and nonlinear order .",
    "we find that , in the semiclassical approximation at least and with strictly conformal matter , the incoming vacuum state evolves into the outgoing vacuum state , with no particle production .",
    "the bounce may be viewed as an example of quantum - mechanical tunneling , and we use complex classical solutions as saddle points to the path integral , in a manner which generalizes the use of instanton solutions to describe tunneling in more familiar contexts .",
    "some of these results were anticipated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we present more details on their derivation , extend them to further cases not discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and provide more mathematical and conceptual background .",
    "an alternate interpretation of the ",
    "antigravity \" regions , not employing complex solutions , has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the simplest example of a `` perfect bounce '' is provided by a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic frw universe , filled with a perfect radiation fluid . adopting conformal time ( denoted by @xmath1 ) , _",
    "i.e. _ , choosing the line element to be ds^2=a^2()(-d^2+d^2 ) , [ frw ] one finds the scale factor @xmath2 .",
    "one way to see this is from the trace of the einstein equations .",
    "for the line element ( [ frw ] ) , @xmath3 and for conformal matter , the stress tensor is traceless .",
    "so the einstein equations imply @xmath2 .",
    "if spatial curvature is included , it is subdominant at small @xmath4 so that @xmath4 still vanishes linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "hence @xmath2 is a direct consequence of conformal invariance and cosmological symmetry .",
    "while the line element ( [ frw ] ) clearly contains a big bang / big crunch singularity at @xmath5 , it is regular everywhere else , not only along the real @xmath1-axis but also in the entire complex @xmath1-plane .",
    "any complex @xmath1 trajectory that connects large negative and large positive @xmath4 while avoiding @xmath6 gives a regular , complexified metric that asymptotes to a large , lorentzian universe in the past and the future , while circumventing the big bang singularity .",
    "such complex solutions have been discussed in quantum cosmology for a long time as saddle points of the path integral , for instance in the no - boundary proposal of hartle and hawking @xcite .",
    "the crucial difference in our proposal is that the complex solutions connect two large , lorentzian regions , identified with a collapsing incoming universe and an expanding outgoing one .",
    "the weyl - invariant lift of gr provides a convenient simplification of the geometry on superspace , cleanly exhibiting its lorentzian nature and the role of the scale factor @xmath4 as a single timelike coordinate for both  gravity \" regions .",
    "this leads us to a novel formalism for quantum cosmology in which , rather than restricting to positive @xmath4 and imposing boundary conditions at @xmath6 , @xmath4 is extended to the entire real line .",
    "the feynman propagator turns out to have simple behavior at large negative and positive @xmath4 , describing a contracting and re - expanding universe , respectively , and connecting them through a quantum bounce .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to flesh out the details of this formalism , and show how it leads to a novel form of singularity avoidance in the context of an extremely simple ( but not altogether unrealistic ) cosmology .",
    "some of the features of our discussion are not new .",
    "the possibility of solving minisuperspace quantum cosmology models exactly by recasting their dynamics as those of a relativistic free particle or harmonic oscillator was pointed out before ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the crucial new feature in our work is the existence of regular solutions ( especially complex ones ) that connect two large lorentzian universes through a quantum bounce .",
    "this feature relies on having a positive energy density in radiation , a possibility which , as far as we know , was overlooked in previous work .",
    "in fact , our results suggest that the fact that the early universe was dominated by radiation may be sufficient in itself for a semiclassical quantum resolution of the big bang / big crunch singularity , without the need for less well - motivated ingredients such as exotic forms of matter @xcite , modified theories of gravity @xcite , or a proposed theory of quantum gravity @xcite . to avoid any potential confusion ,",
    "let us re - emphasize that the theories we consider consist of general relativity with a radiation fluid and a number of free scalars , and nothing more : our use of the weyl lift of gr does not introduce any additional degrees of freedom .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theorysec ] , we introduce the weyl lift of gr plus radiation and scalars , and show how the degree of freedom corresponding to the metric determinant can be isolated straightforwardly , leading us to a weyl - invariant notion of @xmath4 , the `` scale factor '' .",
    "we then study homogeneous , isotropic frw universes in sec .",
    "[ friedbounce ] , showing that in these cases , the einstein - matter action corresponds to that of a massive relativistic particle moving in minkowski spacetime , either freely or subject to a quadratic , lorentz - invariant potential .",
    "we discuss the classical and quantum dynamics of frw universes , using the classical hamiltonian analysis to define the wheeler - dewitt quantum hamiltonian .",
    "we discuss the klein - gordon - type inner product proposed by dewitt @xcite , but take the point of view that the fundamental quantity of interest is really the causal ( feynman ) propagator , which is naturally defined as a path integral over four - geometries @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in sec .",
    "[ feynman ] we calculate the propagator for various cases of interest .",
    "while the feynman propagator for frw universes is actually regular at the singularity @xmath6 , its asymptotic behavior for large arguments displays interesting pathologies both for closed and , in particular , open universes , so that only flat frw universes seem to consistently admit a quantum bounce . in sec .",
    "[ anisosec ] , we extend the treatment to anisotropic universes of bianchi i type , including for generality a number of free minimally - coupled scalar fields .",
    "we resolve the ordering problem in the quantum hamiltonian , and we are again able to explicitly derive the feynman propagator . a very special , singular potential arises centered on @xmath6 which , in the minisuperspace context , is harmless and actually invisible in the scattering amplitude between incoming and outgoing states .",
    "the coefficient of this singular potential turns out to take a special value for the isotropic universe with zero or one conformally coupled scalars , placing it on the edge of a potential quantum instability , as we shall discuss .",
    "the addition of further conformally coupled scalars moves the theory away from this edge , however .",
    "this is an intriguing result that deserves further attention , as it could be used to select between isotropic and strongly anisotropic universes . in sec .",
    "[ pertsec ] , we add inhomogeneities , treated linearly and nonlinearly in the semiclassical approximation where one employs complex classical solutions to the classical einstein equations .",
    "we show how this is sufficient to determine mixing between positive- and negative - frequency modes , and hence to compute the particle production across the `` quantum bounce '' .",
    "we find no particle production , but instead verify that the perturbation expansion breaks down at late times due to the formation of shocks in the fluid , a phenomenon which is now physically well understood @xcite .",
    "[ conclsec ] concludes .",
    "we start by studying the cosmology of a universe filled with perfectly conformal radiation and a number @xmath7 of conformally coupled scalar fields , with gravitational dynamics governed by a `` lift '' of gr to a classically weyl - invariant theory that contains an additional dilaton field @xmath8 .",
    "we stress again that the field @xmath8 is locally pure gauge , and possesses no non - trivial dynamics of its own . this formalism for gr",
    "was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and works in any number of dimensions @xmath9 ( we will set @xmath10 shortly ) .",
    "the total action we consider is s&=&d^d x \\{-j^(_+_a_^a)}.the independent dynamical variables are the spacetime metric @xmath11 ( assumed to be lorentzian throughout ) , the `` dilaton '' @xmath8 , @xmath7 physical scalar fields @xmath12 , and a densitized particle number flux @xmath13 characterizing the radiation fluid .",
    "the latter can be identified by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the particle number density and @xmath16 is the four - velocity vector field satisfying @xmath17 ; the energy density @xmath18 is only a function of @xmath15 , concretely @xmath19 for radiation which is the case we are interested in .",
    "there is a lagrange multiplier @xmath20 which enforces particle number conservation @xmath21 , and @xmath22 further lagrange multipliers @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , enforcing constraints @xmath25 that restrict the fluid flow to be directed along flow lines labeled by the fields @xmath26 which play the role of lagrangian coordinates for the fluid .",
    "in general , the fluid energy density @xmath18 would also depend on the entropy per particle . for simplicity",
    ", we henceforth assume an isentropic fluid for which this entropy per particle is a constant . the fluid part of our action is then the one given for isentropic fluids in eq .",

    "such a transformation also takes @xmath28 .",
    "because of this local conformal symmetry , the field @xmath8 does not correspond to a physical degree of freedom ; indeed , if @xmath29 everywhere , one can gauge - fix the conformal symmetry to recover the usual einstein - hilbert formulation of gr .",
    "it is then clear that there is no physical ghost in the theory even though @xmath8 appears in eq .",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ transf ] ) does not entirely fix the gauge freedom as one can still perform a global rescaling that takes the constant to a different one ; the exact value of newton s constant is arbitrary and corresponds to a choice of units .",
    "einstein gauge corresponds to constraining the @xmath30-vector formed by @xmath31 to a hyperboloid @xmath32 in @xmath30-dimensional field space at each point in spacetime .",

    "we shall identify such regions with imaginary values of the `` scale factor '' and show how the passage of the universe through `` antigravity '' regions is a semiclassical representation of what is really a quantum bounce , similar to how quantum tunneling can be described by complex classical trajectories .",
    "the `` antigravity '' regions do contain a ghost , as now @xmath31 would be constrained to de sitter space @xmath39 which has a timelike direction .",
    "these regions and their ghost excitations do not appear in the physical  in \" and  out \" states of the theory , which are defined in asymptotic timelike regions where @xmath40 ; nevertheless , the existence of these regions can cause pathologies in the quantum theory if initial `` gravity '' states can propagate into the `` antigravity '' regions , as we will see in sec .",

    "when we go down the imaginary axis , _ i.e. _ for @xmath448 with @xmath449 , all perturbation functions fall off exponentially , with exponential terms of the form @xmath450 dominating any polynomially growing terms .",
    "as we have argued , this behavior persists for higher orders in the @xmath382 expansion , and defines these modes by regularity for large negative imaginary @xmath1 ; the blowup of scalar perturbations along the real axis due to nonlinearities in the fluid does not prevent us from defining nonlinear asymptotic positive - frequency modes .",
    "we have given an algorithm for solving the einstein - matter equations order by order in perturbation theory , and exhibited explicit results at second order that show in detail how the positive - frequency incoming modes match only to positive - frequency outgoing modes , and similarly for negative - frequency modes ( where our results trivially extend by taking complex conjugates ) .",
    "we have argued that this behavior should extend to all orders in perturbation theory , as the nonlinear extension of linear positive - frequency modes leads to perturbation functions that decay exponentially for large negative imaginary times , and branch cuts can be restricted to the positive half - plane for positive - frequency solutions , so that the nonlinear metric perturbation satisfies a nonlinear notion of positive frequency .",
    "we identified some subtleties , namely that the perturbation expansion fails at late times @xmath451 , where @xmath382 is the perturbation amplitude , meaning that one has to restrict attention to an annulus in the complex plane , @xmath452 , in which the @xmath382 expansion can be trusted and nonlinearities are not yet dominant @xcite .",
    "this paper represents a detailed study of a very simple cosmological model , based on the principle of conformal symmetry for matter and gravity and the observed fact that the early universe was dominated by radiation .",
    "classical cosmological solutions of this model describe a bounce , with a big bang / big crunch singularity , but the singularity can be avoided by going into the complex plane . while this `` singularity avoidance '' seems ad hoc in classical gravity , we have shown its meaning in the quantum theory where , similar to quantum tunneling , the complexified solutions represent legitimate saddle points to the path integral .",
    "the picture that emerges for quantum cosmology is based on modes that are asymptotically purely positive frequency at early and late times when the universe is large and classical , corresponding to a positive expansion rate of the universe , as we observe .",
    "we have shown that the addition of a positive radiation density makes a crucial difference , as it leads to classical solutions which connect asymptotic contracting and expanding lorentzian regions , and which are represented by the positive - frequency modes defined by the feynman propagator .",
    "we do not impose any boundary conditions for the wavefunction at @xmath6 , and accept that some modes may even diverge there : all that is required is a consistent evolution from an asymptotic contracting to an asymptotic expanding universe , through or `` around '' the bounce , as this allows a calculation of transition amplitudes and hence , ultimately , predictions for the transition of a given state in the contracting phase to a state in the expanding phase .",
    "this formalism appears much more natural than an imposition of a boundary condition at @xmath6 , where quantum effects are large and where classical notions of  singularity avoidance \" may cease to have any relevance . in practical terms , the fact that our wavefunctions and propagators admit a semiclassical wkb description in which high - curvature regions near @xmath6 can be avoided gives hope that a semiclassical approach to the quantum cosmology of bouncing scenarios can be used for predictions , even in the absence of a complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "some features we are exploiting are clearly restricted to homogeneous cosmological models such as the frw and bianchi i universes we have studied explicitly .",
    "it is therefore vital to check that the formalism can be extended consistently to generic perturbations around homogeneity , and ultimately to fully nonlinear solutions of gr .",
    "we have developed a systematic perturbative treatment that shows how this question can be attacked , at linear and nonlinear order , and given evidence for a consistent nonlinear extension of positive - frequency modes to the complex @xmath4-plane .",
    "again , one is interested in the transition of incoming asymptotic positive - frequency modes to outgoing modes which are , in general , a mixture of positive and negative frequency and which signal particle production ( and potential divergencies ) at the bounce .",
    "we have shown that an incoming positive - frequency mode can be continued `` around '' the singularity , and unambiguously matches to an outgoing positive - frequency solution .",
    "so the incoming adiabatic vacuum state is stable across the bounce and no divergencies arise .",
    "our calculations have been limited to pure radiation and planar symmetry , and one focus of future work will be to extend these results to more general cases . the present results already indicate that a consistent semiclassical picture exists for nonlinear perturbations of cosmological models , and that this picture can be used for calculations of the cosmological phenomenology of bounce scenarios of the type we consider .",
    "thus , our results show how classical singularities do not necessarily prevent a consistent quantum description of bouncing cosmologies .",
