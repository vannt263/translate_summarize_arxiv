    "fixed points and their eigenvalue spectrum are used to predict changes in the local stability of a connecting curve as the control parameters are varied . under certain conditions ,",
    "we show that the global stability of a connecting curve can also be predicted .",
    "when the stability is such that the flow undergoes a swirling motion around the connecting curve , an integer index @xmath8 is used to describe the swirling in terms of vortex or hypervortex structures .",

    "this behavior is determined by examining the eigenvalue spectrum of the jacobian matrix along the length of the connecting curve .",

    "the present work was motivated by an attempt to determine how invariant sets of greater dimension than fixed points can be used to determine the structure of flows that result from integrating sets of nonlinear ordinary different equations .",
