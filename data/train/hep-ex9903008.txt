    "it has been demonstrated that elastic photo- and electroproduction of @xmath0 mesons ( fig .",
    "[ diagrams]a , c ) can be calculated within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) [ 69 ] . in these calculations",
    "the elastic cross section is related to the square of the gluon density in the proton and the fast rise of elastic @xmath0 production with @xmath5 reflects the increase of the gluon density in the proton at low values of bjorken @xmath121 @xcite . according to these models elastic @xmath0 meson production consequently offers a sensitive way to probe the gluon density .",
