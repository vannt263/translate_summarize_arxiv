    "the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) model @xcite has received much attention from both theorists and experimentalists for decades , since it is the most essential component of the @xmath0 dimensional field theories , which describe the strongly interacting , non - fermi liquids in one dimension .",
    "the tll model has been discussed in various contexts in the literature , such as one dimensional quantum wires @xcite , josephson junctions arrays @xcite , kondo effects @xcite , carbon nanotube @xcite and edge states of quantum hall effects @xcite .",
    "the tll model in the presence of an impurity is formulated as a one dimensional fermion theory with four fermi interactions on a half line and a tunneling interaction through an impurity at the origin .",
    "the main tool to analyze the model is the fermi - bose equivalence @xcite , which is also called as fermionization or bosonization in the literature @xcite . applying the fermi - bose equivalence to the fermion model ,",
    "one obtains the boson form of the tll model , which is characterized by the two parameters , termed as tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) parameters @xcite . however , these tl parameters seem to be different from those we would obtain by extending the work of coleman on the equivalence between the massive thirring model and the sine - gordon model .",
    "the tll model has two types of the four fermi interactions .",
    "if one of the four fermi interaction term , corresponding to the forward scattering , is turned off , the tll model reduces to the thirring model .",
    "then we can identify the tl parameters in the case of this reduced model by employing the equivalence between the thirring model and the sine - gordon model in ref.@xcite .",
    "( to be precise , the boundary sine - gordon model for the case of the tll model . )",
    "these tl parameters differ from those given in the literature .",
    "there seems to be some discrepancy .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the application of the fermi - bose equivalence with some rigor along the line of coleman s work on the thirring model .",
    "we shall briefly review of the fermi - bose equivalence to identify the setting where the fermi - bose equivalence is applicable .",
    "then we recast tll model into the setting to bosonize the action by redefining the spatial and temporal worldsheet coordinates .",
    "once the action is bosonized , it is rewritten in terms of the non - chiral boson field instead of chiral boson fields .",
    "the reason is that the four fermi interaction terms contain the time derivatives of the boson field , which require redefining the canonical momentum field .",
    "even if the bosonized terms are written as spatial derivatives of the chiral boson fields , it should be noted that they could be equally written also as time derivatives of the chiral boson fields . by only applying the finite conformal transformations , which the theory allows ,",
    "we transcribe the boson model into the schmid model @xcite .",
    "the schmid model has already appeared in the works of kane and fisher @xcite on their study of transport in a one - channel luttinger liquid . however , since their discussions began with the bosonized action of the tll model , the precise relations between the fermion tll model and the schmid model has not been given .",
    "the purpose of this work is to establish the equivalence of the tll model and the schmid model and to identify the precise relation between the couplings of the tll model and those of the schmid model . along this line",
    "we may be able to determine the tl parameters uniquely .",
    "the fermi - bose equivalence is the one of the most powerful tools to analyze @xmath0 dimensional interacting theories . here",
    "we review briefly the equivalence with some details before applying it to the tll model . because the fermi - bose equivalence plays a crucial role in the analysis and requires certain conditions to be fulfilled .",
    "we consider the following action of a free boson field on a cylindrical space - time with euclidean signature [ bosonaction ] s = _ 0^d_-^d(_x _ x + _ x _ x ) where the parameter @xmath1 in eq.([bosonaction ] ) corresponds to the inverse of the regge slope @xmath2 , in string theory and the tl parameter of the bosonized ttl model in condensed matter physics .",

    "where @xmath47 , the strength of the boundary periodic potential becomes strong in the low energy limit . in this region kinks , which are soliton solutions to the equation of motion , appear as new dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "the dual boson field , which describes the dynamics of the multi - kink configurations , replaces the boson field @xmath31 in this phase .",
