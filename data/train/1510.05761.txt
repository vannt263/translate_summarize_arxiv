    "in this paper we study the problem of _ trajectory planning _ in those nonlinear control systems @xmath0 invariant under a lie transformation group , @xmath1 . in this",
    "we emphasise the explicit , exact construction of planned system trajectories which can be obtained by exploiting the geometry of the quotient system @xmath2 together with the symmetries of the parent control system @xmath0 .",
    "the rationale here is that the geometry of @xmath2 is normally quite different from that of @xmath0 ; in particular @xmath2 may be linearizable or flat , even when @xmath0 is not .    in relation to the class of all smooth abstract control systems @xmath3",
    "the subset of those admitting lie symmetries is certainly a very thin one .",
    "by contrast however , among control systems of interest in real applications a great many do admit such symmetries .",
    "this is because in applications such control systems arise from physical or geometrical considerations which come with inherent symmetries such as , for instance , galilean invariance in the case of many mechanical systems .",
    "in fact , it is sometimes surprising to discover just how rich the lie symmetry group of a seemingly intractable control system can be .",
    "we will see examples of this phenomenon herein .",
    "these considerations motivate the study of control systems with lie symmetry .    as is well known , lie symmetry",
    "_ reduction _ has played a significant role in constructing explicit solutions of differential equations over a very long period , @xcite . however , its role in control theory specifically is of more recent date .",
    "various applications of lie symmetry theory to control systems intensified around the early 1980s in works such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and continued in the more recent @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein . of these , _ symmetry reduction _ of control systems is specifically discussed in the foundational papers @xcite ,  @xcite and in the more recent works @xcite where a goal is the role of symmetry reduction in optimal control problems . a textbook account of symmetry reduction in nonlinear control",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the role of symmetry reduction and reconstruction , as formulated by anderson and fels @xcite , in addressing the problem of trajectory planning in nonlinear control systems . by trajectory planning we mean",
    "the solution to the following problem . fix a smooth control system ( [ abstractcontrolsystem ] ) and a connected submanifold @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the manifold of all states .",
    "prescribe any smooth , immersed curve @xmath6 parametrized by time @xmath7 .",
    "determine the time - parametrized curve in the control space @xmath8 that realises @xmath9 .",
    "that is , a time - parametrized curve @xmath8 in control space is the solution of the trajectory planning problem if @xmath10 is the unique solution of @xmath11 .",
    "thus the trajectory planning problem has three pieces of initial data : the smooth control system ( [ abstractcontrolsystem ] ) , a connected submanifold @xmath4 and a smooth , time - parametrized curve in @xmath12 .",
    "the choice of submanifold @xmath12 will normally be determined by the actual control problem that requires solution .",
    "there can be a vast difference in the explicit solvability of the problem depending on the choice of @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we are focussed not only in establishing the existence of a suitable solution but on creating tools for the explicit exact construction of the solution .    a class of control systems for which the problem of trajectory planning can often have a particularly elegant",
    ", straightforward solution is that of static feedback linearizable systems .",
    "these are systems ( [ abstractcontrolsystem ] ) for which there exists a static feedback transformation ) of non - autonomous system ( [ abstractcontrolsystem ] ) is what we later refer to as an _ extended static feedback transformation _",
    ", as in the literature such transformations are usually restricted to time - invariant systems . ]",
    "@xmath13 which identifies ( [ abstractcontrolsystem ] ) with some brunovsky normal form ( _ see _ section [ contactflat ] ) .",
    "the trajectories of any given brunovsky normal form are straightforward to explicitly and completely describe and transformation ( [ staticfeedbacktransformation ] ) can then often be used to plan trajectories for ( [ abstractcontrolsystem ] ) .",
    "there is a wider class of control systems which contain the static feeback linearizable ones as a special subset and having the same useful properties in relation to trajectory planning , namely the so called _ flat systems _ , @xcite .",
    "if a control system ( [ abstractcontrolsystem ] ) is not static feedback linearizable but there is a prolongation of it ( obtained by successive differentiation of one or more of the controls ) which is static feedback linearizable then the system is likewise flat . the problem of bounding the number of prolongations in a control system , in order that it be rendered static feedback linearizable , is largely solved in the work of sluis and tilbury @xcite and chetverikov @xcite .",
    "these authors provide a bound on the  number of integrators  that must be added to ( [ abstractcontrolsystem ] ) so that the prolonged system is static feedback linearizable . for a large class of control systems",
    "these results provide an algorithmic test for linearization via prolongation and therefore the class of control systems for which trajectory planning is often within reach .",
    "therefore , a question of interest in this paper is to explore the problem of trajectory planning for control systems which are _ not flat _ ( therefore not linearizable after sufficient prolongation ) or else",
    "when such linearization of the system does not prove to be helpful for planning trajectories in prescribed submanifolds @xmath14 of state space @xmath5 .",
    "this paper establishes a number of new results and concepts which have both theoretical and practical importance .",
    "firstly , the reduction theory of anderson and fels @xcite has not previously been applied to control systems .",
    "it has the advantage over other theories in that the reconstruction of the dynamics of the original control system from that of its symmetry reduction ( quotient ) has been given a clear and comprehensive geometric formulation .",
    "moreover , the differential system that mediates the reconstruction of the trajectories from those of the quotient system is shown to be a _ system of lie type _ , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "lie type systems have special properties such as superposition formulas and a separate reduction procedure .",
    "an important property is that if the symmetry group of the control system is solvable then the reconstruction of the system dynamics from those of its quotient system can be reduced to quadrature .",
    "secondly , assuming one knows the lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries that generate the action , we show how the contact geometry of brunovsky normal forms can be applied and developed to give a computationally effective algorithm for quickly detecting when a given invariant control system has a static feedback linearizable quotient as well as deducing its basic properties .",
    "importantly , this can be achieved _ without constructing _ the quotient which , in general , is not an algorithmic process . that is , constructing the quotient",
    "explicitly requires integration even if the infinitesimal symmetries are known .",
    "additionally , we establish the notion of _ control admissible symmetries _ which identifies the class of lie symmetries such that the quotient of control system ( [ abstractcontrolsystem ] ) is itself a control system thereby generalizing the notion of state space symmetries . the approach developed in this paper",
    "is very explicit , capable of creating trajectory planning methodologies for general invariant control systems  both flat and non - flat ; variational and non - variational .",
    "finally , the developed theory is illustrated on an important class of control systems , namely marine guidance systems and we derive explicit , novel planning methodologies for surface trajectories .",
    "section 2 mainly gives a brief summary of the theory of exterior differential systems with symmetry , from @xcite , that we shall require .",
    "section 3 begins by describing the geometric formulation @xcite , @xcite of a central object in geometric control theory , namely brunovsky normal forms which are mathematically identical to the contact systems on the partial prolongations of jet space @xmath15 .",
    "it ends by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for when the class of all equivalences between a control system and its linearization contains a static feedback transformation .",
    "section 4 establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of _ linearizable quotients _ of a control system from knowledge only of the lie algebra of its infinitesimal symmetries .",
    "it is pointed out that this begins to address a long - standing problem : given a control system , characterise its  maximal linearizable subsystems  and use these to obtain control theoretic information about the parent system .",
    "the notion of _ control admissible symmetries _ is introduced in this section and the main consequence is established .",
    "the theoretical developments of sections 3 and 4 are illustrated by providing a detailed example of the symmetry reduction of a non - flat control system in 2 controls arising from a result of @xcite .",
    "section 5 is devoted to an application of the foregoing results to the problem of trajectory planning in control systems for under - actuated marine vessels .",
    "we study one such control system in complete detail and show that it is flat ( contrary to a claim in the literature ) but that flatness , of itself , does not solve the most immediate problem of planning surface trajectories .",
    "it is shown however that symmetry reduction and reconstruction does permit the required trajectory planning .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the results that we shall require from anderson and fels , @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by these authors , when carrying out symmetry reduction of pfaffian systems one ordinarily needs to extend one s study beyond the category of pfaffian systems themselves to incorporate exterior differential systems ( eds ) more broadly .",
    "this is because it is possible for the symmetry reduction of a pfaffian system to be non - pfaffian , as pointed out in @xcite . to keep the exposition within bounds as well as incorporating interesting applications",
    ", we will only consider the pfaffian case in this paper .",
    "an eds on smooth manifold @xmath16 or _ exterior differential system _ is a graded ideal in the ring of all differential forms on @xmath16 , denoted @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the set of all differential @xmath19-forms on @xmath16 .",
    "the eds @xmath20 consists of a direct sum of subsets @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23",
    ". not all the subsets @xmath24 need be non - empty .",
    "it is the structure of @xmath20 as direct sum that prompts the qualification _",
    "graded_. we do not have elements of @xmath20 that have , for instance , the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a @xmath27-form and @xmath28 is a @xmath29-form , with @xmath30 . because we shall only consider pfaffian systems in this paper , our ideals consist of degree 1 and degree two components @xmath31 in which the elements of @xmath32 consist of the exterior derivatives of the forms in @xmath33 .",
    "we will therefore not usually mention @xmath32 and refer to the pfaffian system by its degree 1 component which will often by denoted by @xmath0 .",

    "the domain of @xmath48 being @xmath49-dimensional implies that the dimension of the image of @xmath48 is ( at most ) @xmath49 .",
    "it follows from these definitions that if @xmath48 is an integral manifold of @xmath0 then so is @xmath50 .",
    "all actions of lie group @xmath1 on smooth manifold @xmath16 will be assumed to be _ regular _ , ( @xcite , p23 ; pp213218 ) , such that the quotient of @xmath16 by the action of @xmath1 is a smooth manifold denoted @xmath51 together with a smooth surjection @xmath52 which assigns each point of @xmath16 to its @xmath1-orbit .",

    "as proven in @xcite , many properties of the quotient @xmath54 can be deduced from the semi - basic forms .",
    "in particular , if @xmath67 is a cross - section for the action of @xmath1 then the quotient @xmath68 is equal to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , denotes the semi - basic 1-forms . in this paper",
    "we are not concerned with exterior differential systems in general but only with _",

    "as we wish to stay exclusively in the category of pfaffian systems we note the following characterisation , proven in @xcite ( lemma 7.2 ) that if @xmath0 is a pfaffian system then its @xmath1-quotient , @xmath2 , is a pfaffian system if and only if its eds of semi - basic forms is also a pfaffian system .",

    ", this does nt necessarily imply that the quotient system is more tractable to trajectory planning than the parent system ; in fact the opposite is often the case .",
    "therefore for effective use of symmetry reduction in control we focus on the situation in which @xmath0 may not be flat or static feedback linearizable and then seek a quotient @xmath54 that is at least flat , if not static feedback linearizable .",
    "subsequently , we use this quotient to solve the trajectory planning problem for @xmath0 .",

    "note that theorem [ mainthm ] is a specialisation of the corresponding theorem in @xcite , adapted to our situation .",
    "another important specialisation we make is that as we are dealing with control systems we will always require our group actions to _ preserve the independent variable _ , usually _ time _ @xmath7 ; see section [ linearquotients ] .",
    "since brunovsky s seminal paper @xcite there has been a great deal of interest in the exact linearization of nonlinear control systems .",

    "<S> we show that , while a given control system with symmetry may not be static feedback linearizable or even flat , it may nevertheless possess a flat or even linearizable symmetry reduction and from this , trajectory planning in the original system may often be carried out or greatly simplified . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the contact geometry of brunovsky normal forms @xcite , @xcite to develop tools for detecting and analysing these phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by its application to a problem in the guidance of marine vessels . </S>",
    "<S> a method is given for the exact and explicit planning of surface trajectories of models for the control of under - actuated ships . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a 3-degrees - of - freedom control system for an under - actuated ship has a symmetry reduction which permits us to give an elegant explicit , exact solution to this problem .    </S>",
