    "recently , beyond the traditional object detection  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and semantic segmentation tasks  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , instance - level object segmentation has attracted much attention  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it aims at joint object detection and semantic segmentation , and requires the pixel - wise semantic labeling for each object instance in the image .",
    "therefore , it is very challenging for existing computer vision techniques since instances of a semantic category may present arbitrary scales , various poses , heavy occlusion or obscured boundaries .",
    "most of the recent advances  @xcite@xcite@xcite in instance - level object segmentation are driven by the rapidly developing object proposal methods  @xcite@xcite .",
    "a typical pipeline of solving this task starts with an object proposal generation method and then resorts to tailored convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) architectures  @xcite@xcite@xcite and post - processing steps ( graphical inference  @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the network training and the accuracy of segmentation results are largely limited by the quality of object proposals generated by existing methods .",
    "some efforts have been made in refining the object proposals by bounding box regressions  @xcite@xcite and iterative localizations  @xcite during testing .",
    "however , their strategies did not explicitly utilize additional information such as more fine - grained segmentation masks during training to boost the network capability .",
    "intuitively , object proposal refinement and proposal - based segmentation should be jointly tackled as they are complementary to each other . specifically , the semantic category information and pixel - wise semantic labeling can provide more high - level cues and local details to learn more accurate object proposal localizations , while the refined object proposals with higher recall rates would naturally lead to more accurate segmentation masks with an improved segmentation network .",
    "in addition , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : rnn ] , different object proposals may require different extent of refinement depending on their initial localization precision and interactions with neighboring objects .",
    "therefore the recursive refinement should be able to adaptively determine the optimal number of iterations for each proposal as opposed to performing a fixed number of iterations for all the proposals as in those previous methods .",
    "motivated by the above observations , in this work we propose a novel reversible recursive framework for instance - level object segmentation ( r2-ios ) .",
    "r2-ios integrates the instance - level object segmentation and object proposal refinement into a unified framework .",
    "inspired by the recent success of recurrent neural network on visual attention  @xcite@xcite , our r2-ios updates instance - level segmentation results and object proposals by exploiting the previous information recursively .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : framework ] , the instance - level segmentation sub - network produces the foreground mask of the dominant object in each proposal , while the proposal refinement sub - network predicts the confidences for all semantic categories as well as the bounding box offsets for refining the object proposals . to make the two sub - networks complementary to each other , the rich information in pixel - wise segmentation is utilized to update the proposal refinement sub - network by constructing a powerful segmentation - aware feature representation .",
    "the object proposals are therefore refined given the inferred bounding box offsets by the updated sub - networks and the previous locations , which are in turn fed into the two sub - networks for further updating .",
    "r2-ios can be conveniently trained by back - propagation after unrolling the sub - networks  @xcite and sharing the network parameters across different iterations .    to obtain a better refined bounding box for each proposal ,",
    "the proposal refinement sub - network adaptively determines the number of iterations for refining each proposal in both training and testing , which is in spirit similar to the early stopping rules for iteratively training large networks  @xcite .",
    "r2-ios first recursively refines the proposal for all iterations , and then the reversible gate would be activated at the optimal refinement iteration where the highest category - level confidence is obtained across all iterations .",
    "the final results of the proposal can thus be obtained by reversing towards the results of the optimal iteration number .",
    "the optimization of the proposal will be stopped at the optimal iteration when the reversible gate is activated during training , and similarly the generated results in that iteration will be regarded as the final outputs during testing .",
    "one major challenge in proposal - based instance segmentation methods is that there might be multiple overlapped objects , in many cases belonging to the same category and sharing similar appearance , in a single proposal .",
    "it is critical to correctly extract the mask of the dominant object with clear instance - level boundaries in such a proposal in order to achieve good instance - level segmentation performance . to handle this problem ,",
    "a complete view of the whole proposal region becomes very important . in this work",
    ", an instance - aware denoising autoencoder embedded in the segmentation sub - network is proposed to gather global information to generate the dominant foreground masks , in which the noisy outputs from other distracting objects are largely reduced .",
    "the improved segmentation masks can accordingly further help update the proposal refinement sub - network during our recursive learning .",
    "the main contributions of the proposed r2-ios can be summarized as : 1 ) to the best of our knowledge , our r2-ios is the first research attempt to recursively refine object proposals based on the integrated instance - level segmentation and reversible proposal refinement sub - networks for instance - level object segmentation during both training and testing .",
    "2 ) a novel reversible proposal refinement sub - network adaptively determines the optimal number of recursive refinement iterations for each proposal .",
    "3 ) the instance - aware denoising autoencoder in the segmentation sub - network can generate more accurate foreground masks of dominant instances through global inference .",
    "4 ) extensive experiments on the pascal voc 2012 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of r2-ios which advances the state - of - the - art performance from @xmath4 to @xmath3 .",
    "* object detection .",
    "* object detection aims to recognize and localize each object instance with a bounding box .",
    "generally , most of the detection pipelines  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite begin with producing object proposals from the input image , and then the classification and the bounding box regression are performed to identify the target objects .",
    "many hand - designed approaches such as selective search  @xcite , edge boxes  @xcite and mcg  @xcite , or cnn - based methods such as deepmask  @xcite and rpn  @xcite have been proposed for object proposal extraction .",
    "those detection approaches often treat the proposal generation and object detection as two separate techniques , yielding suboptimal results .",
    "in contrast , the proposed r2-ios adaptively learns the optimal number of refinement iterations for each object proposal .",
    "meanwhile , the reversible proposal refinement and instance - level segmentation sub - networks are jointly trained to mutually boost each other",
    ".    * instance - level object segmentation . * recently , several works  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite have developed algorithms on the challenging instance - level object segmentation .",
    "most of these works take the object proposal methods as the prerequisite .",
    "for instance , hariharan  @xcite proposed a joint framework for both object detection and instance - level segmentation .",
    "founded on  @xcite , complex post - processing methods , category - specific inference and shape prediction , were proposed by chen @xcite to further boost the segmentation performance .",
    "in contrast to these previous works that use fixed object proposals based on a single - pass feed - forward scheme , the proposed r2-ios recursively refines the bounding boxes of object proposals in each iteration .",
    "in addition , we proposed a new instance - level segmentation sub - network with an embedded instance - aware denoising autoencoder to better individualize the instances .",
    "there also exist some works  @xcite@xcite that are independent of the object proposals and directly predict object - level masks . particularly , liang  @xcite predicted the instance numbers of different categories and the pixel - level coordinates of the object to which each pixel belongs .",
    "however , their performance is limited by the accuracy of instance number prediction , which is possibly low for cases with small objects . on the contrary",
    ", our r2-ios can predict category - level confidences and segmentation masks for all the refined proposals , and better covers small objects .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : framework ] , built on the vgg-16 imagenet model  @xcite , r2-ios takes an image and initial object proposals as inputs . an image",
    "first passes serveral convolutional layers and max pooling layers to generate its convolutional feature maps .",
    "then the segmentation and reversible proposal refinement sub - networks take the feature maps as inputs , and their outputs are combined to generate instance - level segmentation results . to get the initial object proposals ,",
    "the selective search method  @xcite is used to extract around 2,000 object proposals in each image . in the following , we explain the key components of r2-ios , including the instance - level segmentation sub - network , reversible proposal refinement sub - network , recursive learning and testing phase in more details .      * sub - network structure . *",
    "the structure of the segmentation sub - network is built upon the vgg-16 model  @xcite .",
    "the original vgg-16 includes five max pooling layers . to retain more local details , we remove the last two max pooling layers in the segmentation sub - network . following the common practice in semantic segmentation  @xcite@xcite",
    ", we replace the last two fully - connected layers in vgg-16 with two fully - convolutional layers in order to obtain convolutional feature maps for the whole image .",
    "padding is added when necessary to keep the resolution of feature maps .",
    "then the convolutional feature maps of each object proposal pass through a region of interest ( roi ) pooling layer  @xcite to extract fixed - scale feature maps ( @xmath6 in our case ) for each proposal .",
    "several @xmath7 convolutional filters are then applied to generate confidence maps @xmath8 for foreground and background classes .",
    "an instance - aware autoencoder is further appended to extract global information contained in the whole convolutional feature maps to infer the foreground mask of the dominant object within the object proposal .",
    "* instance - aware denoising autoencoder . * in real - world images , multiple overlapping object instances ( especially those with similar appearances and in the same category ) may appear in an object proposal . in order to obtain good instance - level segmentation results ,",
    "it is very critical to segment out the dominant instance with clear instance - level boundaries and remove the noisy masks of other distracting instances for a proposal . specifically , when an object proposal contains multiple object instances , we regard the mask of the object that has the largest overlap with the proposal bounding box as the dominant foreground mask . for example , in figure  [ fig : framework ] , there are three human instances included in the given proposal ( red rectangle ) . apparently the rightmost person is the dominant instance in that proposal .",
    "we thus would like the segmentation sub - network to generate a clean binary mask over that instance as shown in figure  [ fig : framework ] .",
    "such appropriate pixel - wise prediction requires a global perspective on all the instances in the proposal to determine which instance is the dominant one .",
    "however , traditional fully - convolutional layers can only capture local information which makes it difficult to differentiate instances of the same category . to close this gap ,",
    "r2-ios introduces an instance - aware denoising autoencoder to gather global information from confidence maps @xmath8 to accurately identify the dominant foreground mask within each proposal .",
    "formally , we vectorize @xmath8 to a long vector of @xmath9 with a dimension of @xmath10",
    ". then the autoencoder takes @xmath9 as the input and maps it to a hidden representation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes a non - linear operator .",
    "the produced hidden representation @xmath13 is then mapped back ( via a decoder ) to a reconstructed vector @xmath14 as @xmath15 .",
    "the compact hidden representation extracts global information based on the predictions from convolutional layers in the encoder , which guides the reconstruction of a denoised foreground mask of the dominant instance in the decoder . in our implementation , we use two fully connected layers along with relu non - linear operators to approximate the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the number of output units in the fully - connected layer for @xmath16 is set as @xmath18 and that of the fully - connected layer for @xmath19 is set as 3200 .",
    "finally the denoised prediction of @xmath14 is reshaped to a map with the same size as @xmath20 . a pixel - wise cross - entropy loss on @xmath14 is employed to train the instance - level segmentation sub - network .",
    "* sub - network structure . * the structure of the proposal refinement sub - network is built upon the vgg-16 model  @xcite .",
    "given an object proposal , the proposal refinement sub - network aims to refine the category recognition and the bounding box locations of the object , and accordingly generates the confidences over @xmath21 categories , including @xmath22 semantic classes and one background class , as well as the bounding - box regression offsets .",
    "following the detection pipeline in fast - rcnn  @xcite , an roi pooling layer is added to generate feature maps with a fixed size of @xmath23 .",
    "the maps are then fed into two fully - connected layers .",
    "different from fast r - cnn  @xcite , segmentation - aware features are constructed to incorporate guidance from the pixel - wise segmentation information to predict the confidences and bounding box offsets of the proposal , as indicated by the dashed arrow in figure  [ fig : framework ] .",
    "the foreground mask of the dominant object in each proposal can help better depict the boundaries of the instances , leading to better localization and categorization of each proposal .",
    "thus , connected by segmentation - aware features and recursively refined proposals , the segmentation and proposal refinement sub - networks can be jointly optimized and benefit each other during training . specifically , the segmentation - aware features are obtained by concatenating the confidence maps @xmath14 from the instance - aware autoencoder with the features from the last fully - connected layer in the proposal refinement sub - network .",
    "two output layers are then appended to these segmentation - aware features to predict category - level confidences and bounding - box regression offsets .",
    "the parameters of these predictors are optimized by minimizing soft - max loss and smooth @xmath24 loss  @xcite",
    ".    * reversible gate . * the best bounding box of each object proposal and consequently the most accurate segmentation mask may be generated at different iterations of r2-ios during training and testing , depending on the accuracy of its initial bounding box and the interactions with other neighboring or overlapped instances . in the @xmath25-th iteration",
    "where @xmath26 , the reversible gate @xmath27 is therefore introduced to determine the optimal number of refinement iterations performed for each proposal . while we can check the convergence of predicted bounding box offsets in each iteration",
    ", in practice we found that the predicted confidence of the semantic category is an easier and better indicator of the quality of each proposal .",
    "all the reversible gates are initialized with 0 which means an inactivated state . after performing all the @xmath28 iterations for refining each proposal ,",
    "the iteration with the highest category - level confidence score is regarded as the optimal iteration @xmath29 .",
    "its corresponding reversible gate @xmath30 is then activated .",
    "accordingly , we adopt the refinement results of the proposal at the @xmath29-th iteration as the final results .",
    "we apply the reversible gate in both training and testing . during training ,",

    "the remaining proposals are deemed as background samples and labeled with @xmath54 .",
    "the refined bounding box @xmath55 of the proposal can be calculated as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 represents the inverse operation of @xmath42 to calculate the refined bounding box given @xmath34 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that our r2-ios adaptively adopts the results obtained by performing different number of refinement iterations for each proposal .",
    "if the reversible gate is activated at the @xmath29-th iteration as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : proposal ] , the final refinement results for the proposal will be reversed towards the results of @xmath29-th iteration . thus r2-ios updates the network parameters by adaptively minimizing the different number of multi - loss @xmath45 in eqn .",

    " r2-ios ( w / o autoencoder ) \" often fails to distinguish the dominant instances among multiple instances in an object proposal , and wrongly labels all object instances as foreground .",
