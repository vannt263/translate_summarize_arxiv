    "non - hermitian models have attracted since many years a considerable attention in different areas of physics with applications in a variety of fields , including quantum mechanics of open systems @xcite , parity - time ( @xmath1 ) symmetric quantum mechanics and quantum field theories @xcite , atom optics @xcite , hydrodynamics @xcite , superconductors @xcite , biological @xcite and optical @xcite systems to mention a few .    among various non - hermitian quantum models , great attention has been devoted to the study of the hopping dynamics of a quantum particle in a lattice in the presence of an imaginary vectorial potential .",
    "such a model was introduced in1996 by hatano and nelson @xcite in the context of flux lines in superconductors .",

    "recently , an optical implementation of the hatano - nelson model with an artificial maginary gauge field , based on a chain of coupled optical microrings with tailored gain and loss regions , was suggested @xcite and the phenomenon of non - hermitian transparency was disclosed @xcite . in such previous studies @xcite the imaginary gauge field",

    "we present a theoretical study of the quantum dynamics of a particle hopping on a tight - binding lattice with a time - dependent ( oscillating ) imaginary gauge field , and highlight the role of topology on the structure of the quasi energy spectrum . for a quantum particle hopping on a ring threaded by an imaginary gauge flux ,",
    "the energy spectrum in a stationary gauge field is always complex , however the addition of an ac ( oscillating ) gauge field can result in an entirely real quasi energy spectrum , i.e. the oscillating field can lead to a stabilization effect and pseudo - hermitian dynamics ( sec.ii ) .",
    "a fully different scenario is found for a particle hopping on a finite linear chain with open boundary conditions ( sec.iii ) . in this case",
    "the energy spectrum is entirely real for a stationary imaginary gauge field , since the non - hermitian problem with open boundary conditions is pseudo - hermitian and can be mapped into an equivalent hermitian model via an imaginary gauge transformation .",

    "we show that such phenomena can be explained in a simple physical way by considering the limit of a large number of sites @xmath0 in the lattice .",
    "in such a limit , the two phenomena can be captured by considering a wave packet that either travels along a ring or propagates back and forth in a linear chain .",
    "let us consider an infinitely - extended lattice in the presence of a stationary imaginary gauge field @xmath140 . as shown in ref.@xcite , wave transport in the lattice",
    "is highly asymmetric because wave packets propagating in opposite directions are one amplified and the other one damped .",

    "the opposite behavior occurs when the sign of the gauge field @xmath140 is reversed ; see fig.6 .    .",
    "for @xmath146 [ panel ( a ) ] a forward ( backward ) propagating wave packet is damped ( amplified ) , whereas for @xmath153 [ panel ( b ) ] the reversed behavior occurs.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    with such a property in mind , let us first consider propagation of a wave packet in a ring .",
    "the ring periodic boundary conditions just introduce a quantization of the wave number @xmath144 , which however for a large number sites @xmath0 and sufficiently localized wave packet does not change the dynamics as compared to the infinitely extended lattice .",
    "therefore , for a stationary field a localized wave packet is either damped or amplified secularly , depending on the circulation direction ( either clockwise or counter - clockwise ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that for a time - independent field @xmath140 the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian is complex .",
    "however , when the gauge field @xmath50 oscillates in time , the wave packet undergoes periodic amplification and attenuation , regardless of the circulation direction .",
    "in particular , whenever the time - average of the amplification / attenuation rate @xmath154 \\sin q$ ] vanishes , secular growth or decay of the wave packet is suppressed , and the dynamics is pseudo - hermitian . note that the vanishing on average of the amplification / attenuation rate is precisely expressed by the condition ( 16 ) derived in sec.ii .",
    "+ let us now consider the propagation of a wave packet in a long chain . for a stationary imaginary gauge field @xmath140 ,",
    "a forward propagating wave packet is attenuated , however when it reaches the right chain boundary it is reflected , and the backward - propagating wave packet is amplified at the same rate . at the left chain boundary ,",
    "the wave packet is reflected and the forward - propagating wave packet is damped .",
    "hence a periodic attenuation / amplification in a balanced manner occurs after each reflection at the left / right lattice edges : the dynamics is thus pseudo - hermitian with no secular growth or attenuation of the wave packet amplitude on average . when the imaginary gauge field @xmath50 is an oscillating field with zero mean , @xmath50 changes sign within each oscillation cycle and the dynamics is strongly dependent on the ratio between the oscillation period and the transit time of the wave packet in the chain .",
    "let us assume for the sake of definiteness that @xmath50 is positive in the first half semi cycle of oscillation @xmath155 and negative in the second semi cycle @xmath156 .",

    "the transit time of the wave packet between the two edges of the chain is @xmath157 .",
    "if the transit time in an odd multiple than @xmath158 , i.e. for @xmath159 , an overall amplification in one circulation direction occurs , which cumulates at successive transits back and forth between the two lattice edges .",
    "this is because after each reflection at the lattice edge the sign of @xmath140 changes synchronously . as a result ,",

    "for a long chain , the frequencies at which parametric instability arises are thus a dense set , according to the numerical results [ see fig.4(d ) ] .",
    "the existence of a cut off frequency , above which parametric instability is suppressed , follows from the requirement that the oscillation period @xmath112 must be longer than the characteristic reflection time @xmath164 of the wave packet , i.e. @xmath165 . for a wave packet with lattice extension @xmath166 and group velocity @xmath167 , the reflection time can be estimated as @xmath168 . for a narrow wave packet with lattice extension of a few sites , e.g. taking @xmath169 , the shortest reflection time is obtained at the carrier bloch wave number @xmath170 , corresponding to the largest group velocity @xmath171 and thus to a reflection time @xmath172 .",

    "if @xmath222 is an eigenvalue of @xmath221 , then @xmath223 is an eigenvalue as well .",
    "therefore , provided that some of the elements of the matrix @xmath221 do not vanish , the solution to eq.(a16 ) shows secularly growing terms on the time scale @xmath214 , i.e. the quasi energies of the time - periodic system ( a1 ) become complex with an imaginary part of order @xmath224 .",
    "this explains the existence of multiple parametric resonance tongues found in the numerical computation of the quasi energies , shown in fig.4 . as the number of lattice sites @xmath0 increases , the number of resonance tongues , as determined by the resonance condition ( a18 ) , rapidly increases below the cut - off frequency @xmath133 . + it should be noted that , since @xmath218 vanishes when @xmath225 is an even number , some of the resonance tongues predicted by eq.(a18 ) can be missed .",
    "let us discuss , for example , the simplest case of @xmath70 lattice sites . in this case the three eigenvalues",
    "@xmath20 read @xmath226 therefore , according to eq.(a18 ) resonance tongues are expected to emanate from the two sets of frequencies @xmath227 with @xmath228 .",
    "however , since @xmath229 , the family of resonances @xmath230 is missed . moreover , for a square wave modulation like the one considered in fig.4 only odd fourier amplitudes of @xmath50 do not vanish , i.e. for the family of resonances @xmath231 only those with an odd integer @xmath219 should be considered .",
    "therefore , the actual resonance tongues in a linear chain with @xmath70 sites emanate from the frequencies @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 , ... , in agreement with the numerical results shown in fig.4(a ) .",

    "<S> we consider non - hermitian dynamics of a quantum particle hopping on a one - dimensional tight - binding lattice made of @xmath0 sites with asymmetric hopping rates induced by a time - periodic oscillating imaginary gauge field . a deeply different behavior is found depending on the lattice topology . while in a linear chain ( open boundary conditions ) an oscillating field can lead to a complex quasi energy spectrum via a multiple parametric resonance , in a ring topology ( born - von karman periodic boundary conditions ) an entirely real quasi energy spectrum can be found and the dynamics is pseudo - hermitian . in the large @xmath0 limit , parametric instability and pseudo - hermitian dynamics in the two different lattice topologies are physically explained on the basis of a simple picture of wave packet propagation . </S>"
