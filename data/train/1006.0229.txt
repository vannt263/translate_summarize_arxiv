    "the problem of the assembly of structures in the universe can be addressed , and the vast number of non - linear physical processes that accompany the formation and evolution of galaxies from primordial perturbations can be modelled .",
    "interesting for galaxy formation are the observations of scaling relations , that trace a pattern in the assembly history of the vast variety of objects that we observe in the universe .",
    "the origin and nature of such relations is at the core of the mechanism of galaxy assembly ( courteau et al .",
    "one of the most firmly established scaling relations is the tully - fisher ( hereafter tf ; tully & fisher , 1977 ) , that correlates the luminosity and the rotation velocity of disk galaxies .",
    "the tightness and universality of the relation make it a valid tool to measure extragalactic luminosity distances , since the rotational velocity does not depend on distance or cosmology .",
    "but a most interesting aspect of the relation is also the insight it provides on the mechanism of disk assembly ( tonini et al .",
    "2006a ) .",
    "in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario for disk galaxy formation ( fall & efstathiou , 1980 ) , the disk forms out of gas that cools inside a dark matter halo .",
    "initially in equilibrium with the dark matter , the gas collapses into a rotationally supported disk under angular momentum conservation , while the halo evolves adiabatically ( blumenthal et al . , 1986 ) . as a consequence , the final equilibrium structure and dynamics of the disk",
    "are strongly correlated with those of the dark matter halo , thus providing an insight into the physical halo parameters . in particular ,",
    "the disk rotation velocity @xmath10 , the disk size parameterized through the scale - length @xmath11 , and the disk mass @xmath12 are determined by the halo virial properties , @xmath13 ( dutton et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the slope of the relation is a function of the radius at which the velocity is measured , mirroring the dark matter mass distribution as a function of galactocentric distance ( yegorova & salucci , 2007 ) .",
    "interestingly , although both dynamics and baryonic physics enter the tf , the relation is remarkably tight .",
    "in particular , galaxies follow the _ baryonic _ tf , which links the dynamical properties of disk ( stars @xmath14 gas ) and dark matter halo , with a very small scatter ( see for instance mcgaugh et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the luminosity @xmath15 velocity",
    "tf relation , the measured luminosity is given by the stellar emission , and is therefore a proxy for the stellar component .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the feedback processes , that regulate the balance between stellar and gas mass , follow a scaling with the dynamical quantities , and provide at the same time a source of scatter .    in galaxy formation models ,",
    "the supernova feedback efficiency is one of the main parameters driving the slope and zero - point of the tf relation .",
    "in fact , being the circular velocity of the disk linked to the halo virial velocity , and therefore to its escape velocity , it is also closely related to the ability of the galaxy to blow a wind . the balance between feedback and star formation",
    "sets the amplitude of the tf relation , and its variation across the mass range affects the tf slope ( croton et al .",
    "2006 , de lucia et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "semi - analytic models so far do not have a good grasp of the tf relation .",
    "in fact , although both croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and de lucia et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reproduce the local i - band tf relation ( giovannelli et al .",
    "1997 ) , this match should not be considered a success because they do not model rotation curves in a physically justified way .",
    "de lucia et al . , assumes the total mass profiles are isothermal ( i.e. , constant circular velocity ) , while croton et al .",
    "assume the observed rotation velocity is equal to the maximum circular velocity of the dark matter halo ( in the absense of galaxy formation ) .",
    "both of these assumptions are expected to under - predict the true rotation velocities .    on the other hand , semi - analytic models which actually model the galaxy rotation curves",
    "do not match the tf relation . among these ,",
    "galics ( hatton et al . 2003 ) includes baryons , cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , benson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and benson & bower ( 2010 ) include baryons , nfw halos ( navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) and halo contraction .",
    "in addition , it has been pointed out that semi - analytic models can not simultaneously account for the mass and angular momentum distribution of disk galaxies in a gas - dynamical context ( courteau et al .",
    ", 2007 , van den bosch et al",
    ". 2002b , governato et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in particular for the modeling of the tf relation , sources of systematic errors other than the feedback implementation include the structure of dark matter halos inferred from simulations ( the halo concentration and density profile for instance ) , and the modeling of the dynamics of cooling and baryonic collapse inside halos ( see for instance tonini et al .",
    "2006a , 2006b , piontek & steinmetz 2009 ) .    of interest in the present paper , the predicted tf relation",
    "is also affected by the modeling of the galaxy rotational velocity , and the stellar population models implemented . in this work",
    "we improve both these recipes in the galics model , and re - address the comparison with the observed tf relation .",
    "we consider a broad spectral range from the optical to the near - ir , and in particular we perform the comparison in the k band .",
    "we also compare the model and observed evolution of the tf up to redshifts @xmath0 , both in the optical and in the near - ir .    in current semi - analytic models ,",
    "the rotation velocity of disk galaxies is a crude estimate based on the virial velocity of the host dark matter halos ( for instance de lucia et al .",
    "2004 , croton et al .",
    "2006 ) , or the sum of a halo @xmath14 stellar component in spherical symmetry ( hatton et al .",
    "these approximations do not take into account the actual mass profile of the disk , the effects of angular momentum exchange in the galaxy , and the dark matter halo expansion due to dynamical friction , and introduce systematic errors both in the zero - point and in the slope of the predicted tf ( see dutton et al .",
    "2007 ) . in support",
    "to this point , monaco et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also showed that the observed baryonic tf relation can be matched by hierarchical models if the dark matter halo concentration is lower than predicted by @xmath16cdm simulations ( to @xmath17 for halo masses around @xmath18 ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we implement for the first time in the semi - analytic model galics ( hatton et al . 2003 ) a recipe for the galaxy rotation curve that takes into account the shape of the disk and the angular momentum exchange between disk and bulge and between the galaxy and the dark matter halo .",
    "we do so by modifying the disk and halo parameters following the recipe proposed by dutton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the tf relation predicted by galaxy formation models is also determined by the conversion between stellar mass and light , which is performed through the use of stellar population models . in the original version of galics",
    "( hatton et al . 2003 ) the observed tf relation was not reproduced .",
    "in two recent papers ( tonini et al . 2009 , 2010 ) we showed how the predictions of semi - analytic models are greatly affected by the choice of the input stellar populations .",
    "in particular we showed how the use of the maraston ( 2005 ; hereafter m05 ) models allow galics to reproduce the colours and near - ir luminosities of @xmath19 galaxies , in the mass and age ranges accessible to hierarchical clustering . in this paper",
    "we address the impact of the m05 models on the predicted tf relation in the optical and near - ir , and its evolution with redshift .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the galaxy formation model , and we describe the theoretical recipe to derive the galaxy rotation curves from the dynamical properties of the galaxies and their host dark matter halos , the stellar population models employed , and the method for the selection of model spirals , including the definition of a proxy for the morphological differentiation of these objects . in section 3",
    "we describe the data samples used to make the comparison between model and observations . in section 4 we describe the results for the @xmath5 tully - fisher , and its dependence on morphology . in section 5",
    "we address the evolution of the tf with redshift .",
    "finally , in section 6 we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "we produce the model galaxies through the hybrid semi - analytic model galics ( hatton et al .",
    "2003 ) , and we defer the reader to its original paper for details on the dark matter n - body simulation and the implementation of the baryonic physics . in brief , the model builds up the galaxies hierarchically , and evolves the metallicity consistently with the cooling and star formation history ( with the new implementation of the chemical evolution by pipino et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "feedback recipes for supernovae - driven winds and agn activity are implemented in the code ( the latest with the improved version of cattaneo et al . 2008 ) .",
    "merger - driven morphology evolution and satellite stripping and disruption are taken into account .    in order to compare the model output with the data , we produce mock galaxy catalogues both in rest - frame and observer - frame , adopting each time the broadband filter sets of the data available for comparison .",
    "the broadband magnitudes thus obtained are further scattered with gaussian errors comparable to the observational errors of our data samples ( on average @xmath20 mag ) .",
    "dust extinction is treated in the model , however the observed tf relations that we use for the comparison with data are corrected for internal extinction by the various authors .",
    "for this reason , we produce unreddened galaxies for the comparison with rest - frame tf relations .",
    "when comparing our model galaxies with observed - frame data ( not corrected for reddening ) , we implement dust extinction with a calzetti extinction curve and a colour - excess @xmath21 proportional to the star formation rate for each single galaxy , parameterized as @xmath22 ( see tonini et al .",
    "2010 for a discussion about this choice ) .",
    "magnitudes are presented in the ab system .",
    "we calculate the galaxy rotational velocity at the standard value of @xmath23 ( where @xmath11 is the exponential disk scale - length ) , consistently with the observations used in our comparisons .",
    "the semi - analytic model is rendered for the parameter set @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; these parameters are used to compute observed - frame magnitudes . the model absolute magnitudes are not directly dependent on the cosmology ( which obviously enters in the physics of the semi - analytic model , but not in the computation of the rest - frame light emission from galaxies ) ; when comparing with multiple sets of data , analyzed by different authors with various cosmologies , we re - scale all units to the model @xmath27 .",
    "we calculate the rotational velocity of each galaxy by building its rotation curve and evaluating it at @xmath23 , where @xmath11 is the disk scale - length .",
    "galaxies in the models are systems composed of a dark matter halo and stars distributed in a disk and a bulge ; neglecting the gas component ( which is not dominant in mass , at least at @xmath28 ) the rotation curve is @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the galactocentric distance . for the spheroidal components ,",
    "i.e. the halo and the bulge , the contribution to the velocity is simply @xmath31 . following the original galics recipe ,",
    "the halo density profile is defined as a truncated isothermal sphere . in the simulation halos",
    "are tidally truncated by the surrounding density field , and the inner region of halos is virialized . for the purpose of building the rotation curves ,",
    "we consider halos as spherically symmetric isothermal spheres out to the virial radius .",
    "in addition , halos have a finite density core to avoid the singularity .",
    "the density profile can be parameterized as follows : @xmath32^{\\alpha ( \\beta - \\gamma)}}~ , \\label{sphere}\\ ] ] with @xmath33",
    ". fits to the radial mass distrubution of halos in dark matter - only n - body simulations produce the nfw density profile ( nfw 1997 ) , which belongs to the same family of functions , with parameters @xmath34 . at intermediate radii nfw halos and isothermal spheres",
    "have the same density profile , while at the centre the nfw is shallower and at the outskirts it is steeper .",
    "however , in the range of galactocentric distances of interest in the present work , the difference between the two profiles is negligible ( as is illustrated later on in this section ) . in general , the choice of the halo functional form is a source of uncertainty , and it should be noted that there is an ongoing debate in the literature regarding the shape of dark matter halos in the presence of baryons , expecially in the center of galaxies where the dark matter component reacts to baryonic mass assembly with either expansion or contraction ( see for instance tonini et al .",
    "2006b , duffy et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the halo is almost entirely pressure - supported , with a mild spin component , parameterized by @xmath35 in terms of the halo total mass @xmath36 , angular momentum @xmath37 and binding energy @xmath38 . in simulations",
    "the distribution of the halo spin parameter appears to be log - normal , with both median and scatter independent of mass and redshift to a good approximation ( see e.g. bullock et al .",
    "2001 , vitvitska et al .",
    "2002 , hetznecker & burkert 2006 , bett et al .",

    "the median spin parameter for galics relaxed halos is @xmath39 . for each galaxy in galics , all halo parameters ( virial mass and radius , and velocity dispersions ) are directly taken from the n - body simulation , and naturally cause some scatter in the halo profile .",
    "the bulge stellar mass distribution follows a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile , characterized by parameters @xmath40 , and is assumed to be entirely pressure - supported ( see hatton et al .",
    "2003 for details on bulge formation and geometry ) .",
    "the disk structure and rotation is determined by the halo spin parameter @xmath41 following mo et al .",
    "the disk forms from a baryonic gaseous component that initially has the same specific angular momentum as the halo , a mass @xmath42 in units of the halo mass , and a total angular momentum @xmath43 in units of the halo angular momentum .",
    "the disk is assumed to have an exponential surface density profile , with a scale - length defined as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the halo virial radius ( see mo et al .",
    "1998 for details ) . in galaxy formation models",
    "the assumption of specific angular momentum conservation during disk formation is widely used , which leads to @xmath46 .",
    "this assumption , while useful to semplificate the problem and avoid additional degrees of freedom , is often unrealistic .",
    "in fact , angular momentum transfer from the infalling baryons to the halo pushes the ratio lower than unity , and both the halo and the disk structure are be affected ( see tonini et al . 2006b ; also , piontek & steinmetz 2009 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the ratio can also become greater than unity in case of removal of low angular momentum material ( e.g. , maller & dekel 2002 , dutton & van den bosch 2009 ) .",

    "angular momentum conservation is not a realistic scenario also during bulge formation , as pointed out by dutton et al .",
    "when bulges form through disk instabilities , part of the material in the disk loses its angular momentum , leading to the formation of a pressure - supported component at the center .",
    "the lost angular momentum is transferred to the rest of the disk and the dark matter halo , as seen in numerical simulations ( hohl 1971 , debattista et al .",

    "the sharpening of the disk peak causes the measured total velocity to increase .",
    "however , the presence of other mass components , such as the bulge and the halo , tend to broaden the total velocity peak and push it to smaller radii , where these components are more concentrated .",
    "but the concentration of the bulge mass at the expense of the disk must be accompanied by angular momentum transfer from the bulge to the disk itself , and according to eq .",

    "notice the turn in the model tf slope at the high - mass end , for earlier types ; this is the combined effect of agn feedback and bulge formation . on the one hand , in the more massive objects",
    "the onset of agn activity quenches star formation and thus reduces the galaxy luminosity per unit mass , moving the objects below the relation . on the other hand , while at the low - mass end the mechanism of bulge formation is preferentially secular evolution , which does not introduce a large scatter in the galaxy stellar populations , at the high - mass end bulges form primarily through mergers , which contribute to increase the scatter and raise the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in addition , the larger bulge masses boost the bulge contribution to the rotation curve and increases the rotation velocity .",
    "these factors combined push the model galaxies below the relation at the high - mass end , and increase the scatter in the relation .",
    "this may also be the cause why the velocity range covered by galics spirals is not as wide as the data .",

    "2004 and croton et al .",

    "if galics overpredicts the abundance of large bulges at the high - mass end , then the number of massive spirals evolving into early - types increases , and these objects are lost from the spiral selection .",
    "this is mirrored in the progressively larger scatter and flattening of the slope for earlier - type model spirals .",
    "overall , although the model produces a reasonable tf slope , its performance is unsatisfactory in the b band , it is marginally acceptable in the i band , and it is better , but not perfect , in the k band . the interplay between dynamics and baryonic physics that shapes the tf relation is affected by many factors .",
    "we argue that we have good control over the dynamical model for the galaxy rotation curves and the stellar population models , both of which are physically sensible .",
    "other degrees of freedom are introduced by the supernovae feedback recipe , the chemical evolution model , the star formation history of the model galaxies , dust extiction , and the modeling of the data to obtain rest - frame quantities ( although such adjustments as the @xmath88-correction are small for local samples ) . the increasingly good match between model and data from the optical to the near - infrared suggests two possible causes for the offset .    the first possible explanation is the treatment of dust reddening .",
    "the observed relations used for the comparison have been corrected for internal extinction .",
    "verheijen ( 2001 ) argues that this correction amounts to up to 1.4 mags in the b band .",
    "fluctuations in the dust corrections can be of the same order of the offset we see between model and data .",
    "the better agreement between model and data in the k band is therefore particularly significant in this scenario , since this band is basically unaffected by dust reddening ( and in addition the @xmath88-correction performed on the data to obtained rest - frame magnitudes is relatively small ) .",
    "however , if internal extinction corrections were the main cause of the disagreement in the optical tf , this would imply that in all the observed relations the dust reddening has been sistematically underestimated , which seems implausible .",
    "the disagreement between model and data is present in all bands , but it is much worse in the optical / blue bands , and presents a morphology dependence .",
    "this suggests that the cause may be found in the balance between the emissions of stellar populations of different ages , which means that the star formation histories in the model galaxies are not realistic .",
    "an excess of luminosity like the one we obtain , with a variance from b to k , may hint to an excessively slow decline of the star formation rate towards low redshifts . as will be shown later on , another hint in favour of this argument",
    "is the redshift evolution of the tf , the fact that the match between model and data gets better at higher redshifts .      from the previous section it is evident that the ratio @xmath62 plays a role in determining the slope of the model tf .",
    "in particular , as the bulge mass increases with respect to the disk , the slope of the model tf decreases and the scatter increases . in general , model",
    "late - types agree better with the observed slope .",
    "this is encouraging , as the samples of galaxies selected to observe the tf relation are usually biased towards late - type spirals , which tend to feature cleaner rotation curves , due to stronger emission lines ( masters et al . , 2008 )",

    "the model relation for sa spirals is on the faint side of the data , with a clear bending of the slope at the high - mass end , due to the increasing bulge / disk mass ratio in the model galaxies .",
    "the success of the model in producing a morphology dependence of the tf shows that the balance between bulge and disk emission in the k band is correctly accounted for thanks to the use of the m05 stellar populations .",
    "moreover , it also shows that the balance between the bulge and disk dynamics is effectively represented by the new rotation curve recipe .    as evident from fig .",
    "( [ morph ] ) and the figures in the previous section , the model tf relation shows a small scatter for late - type galaxies , and an increasingly large scatter as the @xmath62 ratio increases .",
    "this mirrors the different mechanism for bulge formation in late and early type spirals .",
    "small bulges are likely to be formed entirely through secular evolution , they do not alter the rotation curve in a significant way , and their stellar populations are coeval with the ones in the disk .",
    "massive bulges are more likely to be formed via mergers , which introduces a large random factor both in the ratio @xmath62 and in the relative ages and chemical composition between disk and bulge stellar populations .",
    "the presence of a large bulge manifests itself with a steepening or a bump in the central part of the rotation curve , which increases the rotational velocity at @xmath107 at a given magnitude .",
    "moreover , the presence of a massive bulge tends to dim the galaxy emission per unit mass ( with respect to a disk - dominated object of the same mass ) .",
    "in addition to increasingly massive bulges , the downward trend at the very high - mass end of the theoretical relation , for the earlier types , is due to the onset of agn feedback , that quenches star formation , and makes galaxies less luminous per unit mass .",
    "although we plotted the masters et al .",
    "( 2008 ) relation as a straight line , from their paper it is evident that this trend is visible in the data as well , and is apparent for sa and sb types .",
    "the model seems to mirror this behaviour , although in the data , it is observed at about @xmath118 , while galics produces it around @xmath119 .",
    "it is evident that galics can not cover the mass range of the data due in part to the simulation limits ; very large spirals are extremely rare in nature , and they occur with 0 probability in the simulation .",
    "moreover , for increasing masses the model galaxies are more likely to experience mergers , which produce larger bulges and increase the @xmath62 ratio ; galaxies therefore are transformed into earlier types and progressively disappear from the tf relation .",

    "the effect of different rotation curve models and stellar population models on the tf is of comparable magnitude .",
    "the m05 run of the semi - analytic model produces a k - band tf brighter by @xmath121 mags than the pegase run . the new recipe for the rotation velocity shifts the tf by @xmath122 in velocity , depending on the galaxy mass and morphology .",
    "there is a certain degeneracy between the dynamics and stellar population models .",
    "the new dynamical model works better than the spherical for both stellar population models .",
    "the analysis carried out so far implies that the model tf is flawed at @xmath5 , in the b , i and k bands , even after we adopted refined and updated prescriptions for the galaxy rotation curves and the stellar populations .",
    "we use this conclusion to gain a better grasp of more profound problems of the model in reproducing the spiral population , in particular regarding the cooling and star formation histories at low redshifts , as will be discussed further in this work .",
    "satellite galaxies in the simulation are defined as objects that do not reside in the center of the parent dark matter halo , but are orbiting around or infalling into a central galaxy .",
    "the gas in satellites is stripped because of ram pressure and tidal effects , while the cooling of new gas is prevented .",
    "this effectively shuts down star formation in satellite galaxies , which evolve passively unless a merger event takes place .",
    "for this reason , model satellite galaxies are ill - suited to be compared with real spirals . for the purpose of clarification and completeness , we show the predicted k - band tf relation for satellite spirals and compare them to centrals .        fig .",
    "( [ kz0sat ] ) shows the @xmath5 k - band tf relation for a sample of model spiral galaxies in the range @xmath87 , and additionally split into central ( _ magenta dots _ ) and satellite ( _ blue dots _ ) galaxies .",
    "it is clear that satellites do not follow a tf relation , but scatter below the central galaxy relation .",
    "the main reason is that satellites are less bright , due to the quenching of the star formation which , even if not affecting directly the k - band , raises the overall mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this affects expecially the low mass end of the satellite distribution .",
    "note that a significant fraction of the galaxies in the master et al .",
    "samples are cluster galaxies , and they follow the same tf relation as the field samples .",
    "we can therefore use the tf relation as a tool to evaluate the ability of the model to reproduce the structure of satellite galaxies .",
    "we conclude without doubt that the model can not produce realistic satellites .",
    "again , the main problem resides in the star formation history .",
    "real satellite spiral galaxies , although perturbed when in dense environments , are still star - forming , in particular those selected for tf studies .",
    "hierarchical models , in order to reproduce the observed colour - magnitude relation , are forced to shut down star formation in satellites .",
    "this highlights a fundamental problem in hierarchical models , that certainly deserves further investigation .",
    "there is an ongoing debate about the formation of s0 galaxies .",
    "the origin of these objects is still not understood , but current scenarios include massive bulge formation , tidal stripping and star formation quenching as possible causes of a transition from spirals to s0 , via a progressive fading of the disk ( see poggianti et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) . in particular , the possibility that s0 galaxies may be spiral galaxies where star formation has been shut down , and the spiral structure has thus become invisible , can be tested with the present study",
    ". an interesting consequence of this is the fact that the tf relation should present an offset between s0 and spiral galaxies ( williams et al .",
    "2009 , bedregal et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) , which should be visible in the photometric tf but not in the stellar mass - velocity tf relation .",
    "however , williams et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find an offset between observed spirals and s0 both in the k - band tf and in the stellar tf , and therefore argue that s0 galaxies are not fading spirals .",
    "we use our model to verify whether star formation quenching introduces an offset between the stellar and k - band tf relation .    in this section",
    "we show the model tf relation in the k - band , compared to the _ stellar _ tf relation @xmath123 , for star - forming and nearly - passive disk galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "we again differentiate the galaxy morphology through the @xmath62 ratio .",
    "model disk galaxies with large @xmath62 and low star formation rate should in principle present a spectral energy distribution similar to real s0 galaxies .",
    "first , the large bulges ( built - up preferentially via minor mergers ) and the small gaseous mass make these objects the transition point between spirals and ellipticals in the model .",

    "in addition , there is a net morphology segregation , which puts the earlier - types , nearly - passive galaxies at the massive end of the relation for any given velocity .",
    "in the k - band relation the star - forming , later - type galaxies are clearly on the brighter , lower - mass end of the relation for any given velocity . if we consider that the _ red circles _ as the model s0 galaxies , the picture is consistent with s0 galaxies being fading spirals .",
    "earlier types , characterized by massive bulge formation , occupy the high - mass end of the population .",
    "the presence of a massive bulge reduces the fraction of galaxy mass that is actively star - forming , so that the specific star - formation rate and the luminosity are low compared with later - types of similar mass .",
    "although more investigation is needed on this topic , we are encouraged to conclude that the scenario that describes s0 galaxies are fading spirals is promising .",
    "we note that a direct comparison between our results and the findings of williams et al .",

    "the model reproduces the observed slope , but tends to be slighly fainter in zero point ( although still inside the observed @xmath136 uncertainty ) . again",
    ", the model galaxies show a very clear morphological differentiation , and the earlier - types fall off the relation at the high - mass end at all redshifts , which as already discussed , is an effect mainly due to bulge formation , and agn feedback .",
    "the decline of the global sfr with time , together with the migration of the star formation to lower and lower galaxy masses ( the downsizing effect ) , causes the galaxies to become fainter and the slope of the tf to get shallower at lower redshifts ( also confirmed by the results of weiner et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the model optical tf agrees very well with the data at high redshift , and by @xmath130 the match starts to fail , where the model galaxies are too faint . by @xmath137 ,",

    "are not corrected for dust extinction , so the model galaxy spectra are reddened according to their star - formation rate , as discussed in section 2 .",
    "the scatter in the data here is large , and we do not attempt to determine the observed slopes and zero points . nonetheless , the accord between the model tf and the observations is good in the range @xmath140 .",
    "both the observed velocity range and luminosity range are well reproduced .",
    "the model galaxies also occupy the same velocity - luminosity space as the data .",
    "moreover , the redshift evolution is reasonably well reproduced .    at @xmath139 ,",
    "the model galaxies are too bright at the low - mass end , consistently with the results at @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ tfz0 ] ) . following the combined information of the evolution of the tf in the optical and near - ir",
    ", we argue that the model star formation histories are realistic down to @xmath141 , and odd for lower redshifts .",
    "disentangling the contributions of the different physical processes conspiring to produce the tully - fisher is not a trivial task .",
    "the slope and zero - point of the relation are determined by the interplay of the dynamics of galaxy assembly inside the dark matter halo , the cooling that regulates the gaseous and stellar content in each halo , the mass accretion and star formation histories and the supernovae feedback , all of which affect the structure and stability of disks as well as the evolution of the luminosity across all bands .",
    "thus , matching the observed tf scaling relation is a fundamental check that the model is correctly predicting the formation and evolution of spirals .",
    "however , a meaningful comparison with the observed tf necessitates of some fundamental steps , that ensure that there are no systematics that can offset the results .",
    "the first step is the correct modeling of the galaxy rotation curves , which are not directly predicted by the semi - analytic model itself , but need to be determined based on the galaxy fundamental dynamical quantities .",
    "the rotation curves extrapolate spatial information in model galaxies , following a dynamical recipe that is physically motivated and that needs to be as sophisticated as possible . in our new model , we made use of models for the mass distribution of the galactic components and angular momentum transfer to the disk accompanying bulge formation .",
    "it is worth noting that a complementary tool in this sense is represented by sph simulations , which favour a detailed study of the galaxy structure , and are able to reproduce the tf relation for single galaxies , ( e.g. piontek & steinmetz , 2009b ) , even if the shape of the rotation curve often remains unrealistic ( see for instance governato et al .",
    "2007 ) , and massive spiral galaxies still represent a problem .",
    "the sophistication of current sph simulations also allows for detailed studies of the effects of perturbations such as ram - pressure on the rotation curves and the star formation ( kapferer et al . 2009 , kronenberg et al .",
    "however , the current resolution limits for this kind of simulations does not allow for cosmological runs and a statistical study .",
    "the second step is the implementation of comprehensive stellar population models , which assures that the photometric side of the scaling relation is not marred by systematic offsets .",
    "we showed that this element can introduce a bias as large as 1 mag in the k - band , and 0.3 - 0.4 mag in the i band .",
    "the third step is a consistency check in the comparison with observations , that presents challenges not related to the semi - analytic model itself . for instance , in a given band , observed tf relations sometimes are not consistent with one another , and the reason for these discrepancies is probably to be found in the data analysis .",
    "in fact , a significant degree of modeling of the raw data is required to produce an observed tf . to name a few ,",
    "corrections are required for completeness , internal extinction , inclination , average distance and size in case of clusters , morphology , peculiar velocities ( see for instance masters et al .",
    "in addition , observed - frame magnitudes have to be converted into rest - frame through @xmath88-correction . and",
    "this introduces a further bias in the comparison . as we pointed out in tonini et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , it is preferable to translate the semi - analytic model into observed - frame and compare the predictions with the apparent magnitudes .",
    "this is crucial expecially for star - forming objects , because their evolution is fast and the corrections are significant , ( expecially for internal extinction and @xmath88-correction ) .",
    "after the systematics in the modeling and in the comparison with data are taken care of in post - production , the hierarchical model can be truly tested , and the problems of the model in reproducing the tf relation can be investigated .",
    "the offset between the model and the observed tf relation has the following features : _",
    "i ) _ it depends on redshift , with a better agreement between model and data at higher redshift ; _ ii ) _ at redshift @xmath5 it depends on the photometric band , with a better agreement in the k band and the worst performance of the model in the b band ; _ iii ) _ it presents a morphology dependence across all redshifts and photometric bands .",
    "these facts suggest that the star formation history of the model galaxies is unrealistic , after @xmath130 . as a consequence ,",
    "the predicted aging of the stellar populations is off , and the emission of stellar populations of different ages is unbalanced . in particular , the decline of star formation with time seems not to be fast enough , with the consequence that the fraction of the total stellar mass constituted of young and intermediate - age stellar populations is too high , a fact that predominantly affects the uv and optical bands , and the near - ir via the tp - agb light .",
    "note that this does not imply a wrong _ instantaneous _ sfr at @xmath5 , which in fact is predicted to be consistent with observations ( hatton et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "central galaxies in a hierarchical model never stop accreting material , including fresh gas and gas previously expelled from the galaxy itself .",
    "although this type of star formation history can be chaotic , in most cases at low redshifts galics star formation histories show a sufficiently steady decline to be approximated in the form of @xmath142models : @xmath143 .",
    "we calculated the predicted luminosity of model galaxies with different star formation timescales , and found the latter to be a fundamental parameter regulating the relative luminosities in b and k. for instance , a galaxy of age of @xmath144 with a star - formation history like @xmath145 ( with a e - folding time @xmath146 ) produces a b - band magnitude brighter by @xmath147 mags compared to a model like @xmath148 ( with a e - folding time @xmath149 ) , while it is brighter in the k - band by @xmath150 mags . from fig .",
    "[ tfz0 ] it is evident that a shift of @xmath147 mags in the b band would produce a much better agreement between model and data , while at the same time , a shift of @xmath150 mags in the k band would still preserve the accord with the observed relations .",
    "a faster decline of the star formation in time allows the galaxies to fade more rapidly at low redshifts , and brings the predicted tf relation down in luminosity . to size this effect , consider what happens to satellites after the star formation is shut down ( fig .",
    "[ kz0sat ] ) . also , as shown in all previous figures , as more and more of the fraction of galaxy mass is in the inactive bulge component , or agn feedback kicks in , the galaxy tends to fade and fall below the tf relation .",
    "we argue that , in order to fix this problem , a more radical revision of gas infall and cooling is probably needed .",
    "a more detailed investigation of this point is of great interest , but it is beyond the present scope , in that it requires an extended comparison with sfr derived from observations at different redshifts .",
    "note that the derivation of sfr from observations is affected by the adopted stellar population models , dust extinction corrections , star - formation history laws , as discussed in maraston et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and the use of inhomogeneous sets of such priors in comparison with our model will lead to significant biases .",
    "this line of investigation is currently under development    in addition to the star formation history , a second - order effect on the optical tf is caused by the chemical evolution model in use .",
    "the current version of galics implements the pipino et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recipe which , compared to hatton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , produces slightly lower total metallicities , causing the galaxies to be brighter . depending on age and star formation history , the difference in magnitude amounts to anything between @xmath151 and @xmath4 in the b band , and less for the i and k bands . accounting for uncertainties in the chemical evolution recipe",
    "would only lead to a modest increase of the tf scatter , which would be consistent with the scatter in the data , but it would not shift the overall relation in a significant way .",
    "there is also the possibility that part of the discrepancies that we encountered in our comparison with data are due to a flaw in the modeling of the galactic dynamics . in particular ,",
    "the galaxy rotation may be offset , regardless of the galaxy type , due to a wrong determination of the galaxy angular momentum .",
    "this can be investigate by analyzing the disk scale - lenghts @xmath11 produced by the model .     as in the previous figures .",
    "_ filled triangles _ represent the same galaxies after angular momentum transfer from the bulge is evaluated ( the new model ) . ]",
    "figure [ rl ] shows the model disk scale - lenghts as a function of i - band luminosity , compared with the relation obtained by courteau et al .",
    "( 2007 ) from observations ( _ solid / dashed lines _ for the relation and its scatter ) .",
    "the _ empty dots _ represent model galaxies in the spheroidal model , colour - coded according to @xmath62 as in the previous figures . _",
    "filled triangles _ represent the same galaxies after angular momentum transfer from the bulge is evaluated ( the new model ) .",
    "it is evident that the model can not reproduce the courteau et al .",
    "the disk - scale lenght appears to be too large , and the scatter too big , the latter a problem that was mentioned already in hatton et al .",
    "more in detail , the model does not reproduce the courteau et al .",
    "relation for the late - type spirals ( _ yellow points _ ) , which are mostly untouched by our new velocity model . in the old spheroidal model ,",
    "the earlier - type spirals present a marginal agreement with the data , which we argue is accidental .",
    "in fact , the values of the disk - scale lenghts inferred from observations are commonly obtained by fitting the surface brightness profile with an exponential law , and that the result is more accurate the closer the galaxy is to a pure disk .",
    "galaxies with large bulges are not ideal candidates , and they tend to be excluded from the observational samples .",
    "the new model effectively corrects for the presence of the bulge , moving the earlier - type spirals in the same @xmath152 space as the later - types , in a sense making all galaxies consistently offset with the courteau et al . relation .    before analyzing the possible causes of the discrepancy",
    ", it should be noted that a source of error stems from the use of eq .",
    "( [ rd ] ) for the determination of @xmath153 .",
    "this formula , adopted by hatton et al .",
    "2003 , produces the highest @xmath153 under angular momentum conservation , in the mmw formalism .",
    "additional shape factors that can reduce the value of @xmath153 are set to unity , but as discussed in tonini et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , their values as inferred from observed rotation curves are actually close to unity , and vary slowly with disk mass .    as for the cause of the discrepancy with the courteau data , we offer 2 explanations :    \\i ) as discussed in tonini et al .",
    "( 2006a ) and donghia & burkert ( 2004 ) , the halo spin parameter , which is found to vary from @xmath154 in galics to @xmath155 in other simulations , is too high compared with the one that can be inferred from observations of spirals . if @xmath156 for instance ( the value inferred by tonini et al .",
    "2006a ) , then rd is smaller by @xmath157 , which would push our model @xmath11 towards the courteau et al . relation .",
    "note that , although @xmath41 originates naturally from tidal forces during structure formation , the discrepancy between the simulated and observed @xmath41 is not necessarily due to a flaw in the simulations , but rather it hints at a subsequent redistribution of angular momentum between baryons and dark matter ;    \\ii ) as mentioned in section ( 2.1 ) , the ratio @xmath52 is equal to unity only under angular momentum conservation , which is not a realistic scenario during galaxy formation .",
    "in particular , if the baryonic component that collapses to form the protogalaxy is clumpy , it likely dissipates angular momentum in its path to the centre of the dark matter halo , as proposed by tonini et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , and therefore @xmath158 . consequently , the disk scale - length is smaller , and the tension between model @xmath153 and observations is partially alleviated ( @xmath159 leads to a decrease of @xmath11 by @xmath160 ) .",
    "the mmw recipe can therefore be considered a maximal scale - length scenario , with the real scale - length distribution being centered on smaller values of @xmath153 because of angular momentum transfer .",
    "both the effects described above contribute in reducing the size of @xmath153 , and are currently not investigated in semi - analytic models .",
    "note also that such effects do not depend on redshift nor on photometric band , therefore they do not affect our conclusions on the model star formation histories discussed in the previous section .",
    "an additional , largely unknown source of scatter , on both the disk scale - lengths and the rotation curve , is represented by the dark matter halo structural evolution . on the one side ,",
    "readjustments in the halo profile induced by the baryon infall can lead to a dramatic change in the inner density profile ( tonini et al .",
    "2006b ) , thus altering the contribution of the halo to the total velocity . on the other side ,",
    "tidal interactions between halos and mass accretion in the hierarchical assembly repeatedly strip and add material in each halo . there is no standard recipe in semi - analytic models to recalculate the halo equilibrium structure that takes into account all these effects , and since there is no spatial information inside single objects , the mass is the primary driver of halo evolution .",
    "the virial radius in particular is not recalculated after every interaction , with the consequence that the halo density profile can oscillate quite a lot . note that also in n - body simulations , although all halos are fitted to a common functional profile ( like the nfw or the isothermal sphere ) , the scatter on the profile is very large , as is the scatter on the mass - virial radius relation ( bullock et al .",
    "the scatter in the virial radius directly translates into a scatter in @xmath153 , while the scatter in the density profile affects the halo velocity .",
    "in particular , an overestimation of the disk scale - lengths will occurr in cases where the mass loss via tidal stripping dominates the halo evolution .",
    "the offset between model and observed disk scale - lengths represents an interesting failure of the model , that arguably sheds light on some missing physics .",
    "these considerations suggest that baryon cooling and halo structural evolution in the model need some more fundamental revision , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we analyzed the predictions of the hierarchical galaxy formation model galics on the tully - fisher relation and its evolution with redshift .",
    "we introduced two new elements in the model : 1 ) a new recipe for the determination of the galaxy rotation curves , based on the correct dynamical modeling of the different galactic components , and taking into account the angular momentum exchange between bulge and disk due to secular evolution ; 2 ) the m05 stellar population models , that include an exhaustive treatment of the tp - agb emission , which affects galaxies with ongoing star formation .",
    "our main conclusions are :    @xmath161 the improvement on the dynamical description of disk galaxies and on the stellar population models impacts the model tf by effects of comparable magnitude ; in particular , velocities are shifted to values lower by @xmath162 depending on the galaxy mass and morphology , and the k - band magnitudes are brighter by @xmath163 mags at redshift zero and up to @xmath6 mags at redshift @xmath0 and above ;    @xmath161 at redshift @xmath5 the model reproduces the slope of the observed tf for sb / sc spirals , in the b , i and k band , but not the zero - point , which is too bright in all bands",
    ". in particular , in the k band the zero - point is too bright for sb / sc galaxies at the low - mass end ( @xmath164 ) , although the model galaxies lie within the scatter of the observed tf relation . in the b and",
    "i band , the predicted zero - point for sb / sc galaxies is too bright across the mass range .",
    "we argue that the most probable cause of the discrepancy lies in unrealistic star - formation histories at @xmath165 ;    @xmath161 the model predicts a morphology dependence of the tf relation at all redshifts . at @xmath5 observations in the k - band",
    "confirm this trend , and the comparison between model and data is encouragingly good , expecially for sb / sc spirals .",
    "this is an important confirmation that our more sophisticated treatment of the galaxy dynamics is realistic .",
    "the model rotation curve now mirrors the morphological differentiation observed in nature , well representing the balance between bulge and disk , and the consequent variations in the predicted tf along the hubble sequence are put in sharper evidence .",
    "the model predicts a steeper slope and a smaller scatter for later - type galaxies , and a progressive flattening of the slope and larger scatter for earlier types .",
    "this is coherent with the picture of bulge formation in a hierarchical scenario , where the incidence of mergers is significant in the case of massive bulges , while small bulges are more likely to develop via secular evolution .",
    "moreover , with the m05 stellar population models , galics is able to correctly reproduce the balance between the bulge and disk emission in the k band ;    @xmath161 the scatter in the model galaxies increases from late types ( sb / sc ) to early types ( sa / s0 ) , because the main mechanism for bulge formation switches from secular evolution ( sb / sc ) to minor mergers ( sa / s0 ) . at the high - mass end ,",
    "earlier - type galaxies show a flattening of the slope and tend to fall below the relation due to the presence of massive bulges and agn feedback ;    @xmath161 the study of the tf relation for model satellites galaxies confirms previous hints that the model can not produce realistic non - central spirals ;    @xmath161 the tf relation can be used as a discriminating tool to investigate the origin of s0 galaxies , in the scenario where these objects form from the fading of spirals after star - formation shutdown ;    @xmath161 the model reproduces the redshift evolution of the tf for later - type galaxies from @xmath166 to @xmath132 in the rest - frame b band , where slope , zero - point and scatter are reproduced for sb / sc spirals .",
    "the model is consistent with the data in the observed - frame k band at redshifts between @xmath167 and @xmath132 .",
    "the simultaneous match in the optical and near - ir evolution , although needing more tests with larger data samples , indicates that the mass assembly and star formation histories , as well as the supernovae feedback implementation , are satisfactory at these redshifts ;    @xmath161 the model can not reproduce the whole optical tully - fisher evolution from @xmath137 to @xmath99 .",
    "we argue that the decline of the star formation is too slow , thus preventing the model from matching simultaneously the local and distant relations ;    @xmath161 the model produces disk scale - lengths too large compared with observations .",
    "we argue that this mirrors a too simplistic recipe of disk formation inside dark matter halos , that does not take into account angular momentum redistribution during the baryonic collapse .",
