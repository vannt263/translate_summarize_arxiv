    "the topological consideration of effective relativistic quantum field theory in three dimensional ( 3d ) momentum space allow us to classify quantum vacuum into three distinct classes , namely , that with gap , fermi surfaces ( fss ) and weyl points.@xcite the topological classes with fermi surface or gap are well known in condensed matters as metals or insulators .",
    "the insulators have been further classified into topologically trivial and non - trivial insulators .",
    "@xcite for the later case , there have been many candidate materials being proposed and some of them confirmed by experimental observations .  @xcite the class of compounds with weyl fermi points are relatively rare , however the @xmath1 phase of @xmath2he  @xcite and some recent proposals  @xcite have suggested various possibilities .",
    "in addition to weyl fermi points , as we will demonstrate in this paper , the fermi surfaces can be further classified  @xcite and each of them can be realized in condensed matters . on the other hand ,",
    "given those known realizations of distinct topological states , it is yet challenging to have a well controlled example near the phase boundary so that various topological phase transitions can be studied systematically within one system .",
    "this challenge becomes further relevant because the vacuum of the standard model is regarded to be at the phase boundary with marginal fermi points ( mfp ) , which is composed of two overlapping weyl points with opposite chirality ( or topological charge ) , i. e. , forming 3d massless dirac points .",
    "@xcite the weyl points with opposite chirality are stable topological objects only when they are separated .",
    "if they meet in momentum space , their topological charges may cancel each other and open a gap . in principle , we may accidentally obtain 3d dirac points by finely tuning chemical composition or spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) strength .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , such realizations are too fragile and hard to control .",
    "in fact , in the presence of crystal symmetry , the 3d dirac points can be protected and stabilized , as has been discussed in ref .",
    "18 and will be addressed in this paper .    here ,",
    "we report that the 3d dirac semimetal ( or mfp ) state can be achieved in a simple stoichiometry compound @xmath0bi ( @xmath1=na , k , rb ) , where the low energy states form an effective 3d massless gas of dirac fermions , being different from those in graphene ( 2d dirac fermion ) and weyl semimetals ( non - overlapping weyl points ) .",
    "this state is located at the phase boundary , and is stabilized by the crystal symmetry .",
    "it can be driven into various topologically distinct phases by explicit breaking of symmetries , and thus provides us a nice example for the systematical studies of topological phase transitions .",
    "in addition , the state itself is topologically non - trivial in the sense that it has fermi arcs on the surfaces , and it show giant diamagnetism and quantum magnetoresistance ( mr ) in the bulk .",
    "it can also show the quantum spin hall effect in its quantum - well ( or thin - film ) structure .",

    "taking na@xmath17bi as an example , in this structure ,  @xcite there are two nonequivalent na sites ( na(1 ) and na(2 ) ) .",
    "na(1 ) and bi form simple honeycomb lattice layers which stack along the @xmath13 axis , while na(2 ) atoms are inserted between the layers , making connection with bi atoms . from the ionic picture , due to the closed - shell configuration where the number of valence electrons ( 3@xmath20na-@xmath21+bi-@xmath22 ) is equal to six , we may expect a semiconducting nature of these compounds , similar to na@xmath17sb .",
    "@xcite however , they are in fact different .    to explore the electronic properties of @xmath0bi , we performed band - structure calculations based on the plane - wave ultra - soft pseudopotential method , using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation functional .",

    "very close to the fermi level , the top valence band is mostly from bi-@xmath27 states , while the conduction band with very strong dispersion is mostly from na(1)-@xmath26 states .",
    "all these pictures are similar to that of na@xmath17sb ,  @xcite but with the key difference that at the @xmath28 point , the na-@xmath26 band is lower than bi-@xmath27 by about 0.3 ev , and it is further enhanced to be 0.7 ev in the presence of soc , resulting in a metal with an inverted band structure , rather than the normal narrow gap semiconductor like na@xmath17sb .",
    "@xcite the band inversion is mostly due to the heavier bi , which has higher @xmath25 states and larger soc compared to sb . considering the possible underestimation of the band gap by gga , the band inversion can be further confirmed by the following evidences : ( 1 ) calculation using hybrid functional hse gives a band inversion around 0.5 ev , still reasonably strong ; and ( 2 ) the earlier calculations for normal semiconductor k@xmath17sb  @xcite suggest that its experimental gap can be reasonably reproduced by gga . with the same method , we calculate the band structures for k@xmath17bi and rb@xmath17bi and find that the band inversions are 0.33 and 0.42 ev , respectively . because of the similar band structures and the same outcomes of the analysis , we mainly investigate na@xmath17bi for details in the following .    bi .",

    "since both time reversal and inversion symmetries are present , there is four - fold degeneracy at each fermi point , around which the band dispersions can be linearized , resulting in a 3d massless dirac semimetal .",
    "it is different from that in graphene not only in dimensionality , but also in its robustness , because the fermi points here survive in the presence of soc .",

    "breaking of this symmetry will introduce interaction between them and make the system insulating .",
    "for example , 1% compression along the @xmath34 axis will open up a gap of @xmath315.6 mev .",
    "this insulating state , however , is topologically non - trivial with @xmath35=1  @xcite due to the inverted band structure around the @xmath28 point .",

    "the spin texture of surface states has a helical structure ( also similar to topological insulators ) , but the magnitude of spin vanishes at the singular points .",
    "this kind of fermi surfaces has never been found before , and it can be understood following the discussions for weyl semimetal .",
    "@xcite if we split the 4@xmath204 dirac point into two separated 2@xmath202 weyl points in momentum space by breaking time reversal or inversion symmetry ,  @xcite the fermi surface of surface states will also split into open segments which are fermi arcs discussed in weyl semimetal ( as shown in fig .",

    "our further calculations for k@xmath17bi and rb@xmath17bi suggest that they have qualitatively the same physics as na@xmath17bi does .",
    "the low energy effective hamiltonian is derived from the theory of invariants in a similar way as for bi@xmath24se@xmath17 , bi@xmath24te@xmath17 and sb@xmath24te@xmath17 .",
    "@xcite the first - principles calculations indicate that the wave - functions of low energy states at the @xmath28 point are mostly from the na-3@xmath29 and bi-6@xmath36 orbitals . for the low energy na-3@xmath29 stats at @xmath28 , about 65% of them are from na(1)-3@xmath29 and 35%",
    "are from na(2)-3@xmath29 .",
    "since the system has inversion symmetry , we can start from the bonding and antibonding states of the above relevant orbitals with definite parity :    @xmath37    where na(bi ) and na@xmath38(bi@xmath38 ) are related by inversion symmetry .",
    "the superscript @xmath5 indicates the parity , and @xmath39 is @xmath40 , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "the bonding and anitbonding splittings of these states can be easily seen from the band structure along path @xmath1-@xmath28 shown in fig .",
    "2 .    by including the soc effect in the above atomic picture , spin and orbital angular momentum",
    "are coupled and the new eigenstates with definite total angular momentum can be written as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where the subscript indicates the total angular momentum @xmath47 .",
    "different from the case with zinc - blende structure ( such as hgte ) , here the heavy - hole state @xmath44 and light - hole states @xmath48 are no longer degenerated ( with the former being higher ) at the @xmath28 point , because bi atoms are sandwiched by na(2 ) atoms along the @xmath49 axis , and the bi @xmath50 orbital is lower than @xmath51 orbitals .",
    "furthermore , under the @xmath52 symmetry , the light - hole state @xmath53 and split - off state @xmath54 will mix further to form the new eigen states : @xmath55 and @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless these mixed states are not relevant to our discussions for the 3d dirac points .",
    "the band inversion and their crossings along @xmath28-@xmath1 line can be described by the four states @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "please note the leading - order term of off - diagonal elements @xmath79 has to take the high order form of @xmath80 under the three fold - rotational symmetry and the opposite parity of @xmath81 and @xmath82 states .",
    "evaluating the eigen values @xmath83 , we get two gapless solutions at * k*@xmath84=(0 , 0 , @xmath85 ) , which are the two dirac points discussed above , which are separated along the @xmath86 line .    if we only concentrate on the neighborhood of each crossing points @xmath87 , and neglect the high order terms ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) , the linearized hamiltonian is nothing but 3d massless dirac fermions .",
    "the block diagonal form allows us to decouple the 4@xmath204 matrix into two 2@xmath202 matrices , which are weyl fermions with degenerate energy but opposite chirality .",

    "@xcite for simplicity of illustration , here we focus on the effects of exchange interaction . in general",
    ", it can be induced by magnetic doping as in diluted magnetic semiconductors  @xcite or by an external field .",
    "other symmetry - breaking terms ( such as inversion , mirror or two fold rotational symmetries of the crystal ) may play the similar roles and can be analyzed analogously .",
    "since the @xmath81 and @xmath82 are different orbitals ( or pseudo spins ) , we may in general separate any exchange splitting into orbital - dependent and orbital - independent parts as @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath33 and @xmath98 are field strengths ( along the @xmath49 direction ) , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 are pauli matrices describing spin and pseudo - spin respectively .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given as @xmath101 , and the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig.4 .",
    "if the three fold rotational symmetry of crystal is preserved ( i.e. @xmath79=@xmath102 , see left panels of fig.4 ) , starting from the mfp state ( @xmath33=0 , @xmath98=0 ) , the state with weyl points will be introduced by @xmath33 ( the horizontal axis ) , because such an exchange field will split the dirac point into two separated weyl points in momentum space . if the @xmath98 is further introduced , however , the two weyl points will separate energetically , and a system with fermi surfaces ( fs ) will be obtained .",
    "on the other hand , if the three - fold rotational symmetry is broken , a mass term @xmath103 will be induced as the leading - order term of @xmath79 .",
    "for example , @xmath90 can be estimated to be the gap size ( 5.6 mev ) at * k*@xmath84 when 1% compression along the @xmath34 axis is applied .",
    "then the high order term of @xmath79 can be neglected , and a topologically non - trivial insulating phase is obtained ( see right panels of fig .",
    "in such a case , the weyl semimetal phase can be driven only when @xmath33 is larger than the mass term @xmath90 .",
    "the fs states can be further classified according to the topological charge ( or chern number @xmath104 ) enclosed by the fs .",
    "@xmath104 is defined as the net flux of the berry phase gauge field penetrating the fermi surface , @xmath105 where the integrand is the berry curvature , * a(k)*=@xmath106 is the adiabatic berry connection for the states @xmath107 at the fermi level , and @xmath108 points from low to high energy . for the case @xmath90=5.6mev ( right panels ) ,",
    "the two distinct fs states , trivial ( @xmath109 ) and non - trivial ( @xmath110 ) , are separated by the line defined as @xmath111=@xmath112 . if @xmath113 ( left panels ) ,",
    "both fs states are non - trivial , but with different topological charges ( @xmath114 or @xmath115 ) .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath104=@xmath115 phase in this case is due to the @xmath80 term of @xmath79 . at the boundary between distinct fs states ,",
    "the fermi surface spheres should be connected , and the @xmath104 becomes ill - defined .",
    "the non - trivial fs states may become important for the topological superconductivity .",
    "@xcite      even without the exchange splitting , we can expect some particular physical properties for such compounds .",
    "first of all , we will expect the quantum spin hall effect in @xmath49-oriented na@xmath17bi thin film ( or a na@xmath17bi / na@xmath17sb quantum well ) . due to the quantum size effect",
    ", the @xmath116 is further quantized , and in general the 2d band structures of na@xmath17bi thin film will be fully gapped .",
    "then depending on the number of band inversions associated with the subbands , the system should cross over between trivial and non - trivial 2d insulators oscillatorily as a function of film thickness .",
    "@xcite our estimated first critical thickness of na@xmath17bi is 35   , below ( above ) which the film is a trivial ( non - trivial ) insulator .",
    "second , we will expect giant diamagnetism of the 3d massless dirac fermion .",
    "@xcite the diamagnetic susceptibility , @xmath117@xmath118log@xmath119 , should diverge logarithmically when the chemical potential approaches the 3d dirac points ( i.e. @xmath120@xmath1180 ) ,  @xcite much stronger than that in narrow gap semimetals like bismuth .",
    "in fact , early experimental measurement had found distinct diamagnetism in the @xmath0bi system.@xcite third , we will also expect linear quantum magnetoresistance ( mr ) as proposed by a. a. abrikosov .",
    "@xcite in conventional metals with closed fermi surface , the mr should behavior quadratically at a low field and saturate at a high field . however , for the 3d massless dirac fermionic gas , the mr will have linear field dependence if only the lowest landau level is occupied .",
    "this idea has been examined for the ag@xmath24te both experimentally and theoretically ,  @xcite where the dirac - type energy dispersion is not obvious .",
    "having na@xmath17bi with 3d dirac points , it will be straightforward to check the quantum mr proposal .",
    "in summary , based on the first - principles calculations and effective model analysis , we have shown that the long - pursuing examples with bulk 3d dirac points can be actually realized in existing compounds @xmath0bi ( @xmath1=na , k , rb ) . it is important to note that this state and its dirac points are protected by crystal symmetry , and therefore stable .",
    "we have demonstrated that this state is located at the topological phase boundary , and can be driven into various topologically distinct phases , such as topological insulator , topological metal ( with non - trivial fermi surfaces ) , and weyl semimetal states , by explicit breaking of symmetries .",
    "it therefore may provide us a condensed - matter simulator of the standard model , from the view point of an emerging relativistic quantum field at low energy .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the state itself is unconventional in the sense that it shows fermi arcs on the surface , giant diamagnetism and linear quantum magnetoresistance in the bulk , and quantum spin hall effect in the quantum - well or thin - film structure .",
