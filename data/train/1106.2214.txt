    "subsequent studies have raised the problem of analyzing the inhibition of the dynamics induced by continuous measurements , meant as dissipative processes  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the emission of radiation from a quantum system could be thought of as measurement process , since it says to the observer in which state the system was before the emission .",
    "apart from philosophical discussions , the presence of a strong decay can be responsible for a dynamical decoupling , hindering the dynamics induced by other couplings  @xcite .",
    "further developments has brought to the idea that even a unitary coupling can be responsible for the inhibition of the dynamics induced by smaller couplings  @xcite , eventually leading to the concept of zeno subspaces , i.e. , the formation of suitable invariant subspaces that cancels the effects of weak couplings , as shown by facchi and pascazio  @xcite .",

    "starting from the study  analytical and numerical  of the interaction between a three - state system and a single harmonic oscillator at thermal equilibrium , and between the same three - state system and a finite number of thermalized harmonic oscillators , we find a universal feature corresponding to the partitioning of the hilbert space of the three - state system at high temperatures .",

    "we extend the discussion to the case of a finite but arbitrary number of harmonic oscillators , and in the fourth section we give an estimation of a temperature high enough to observe the formation of zeno subspaces . finally , in the last section we provide a detailed discussion of the results .",
    "we consider a three - state system coupled with an harmonic oscillator tuned close to the transition @xmath0 .",

    "this hamiltonian is structured as a set of invariant blocks of the form : @xmath14 corresponding to the triplet @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",

    "when the condition @xmath19 is fulfilled , such unitary operator does not significantly change the population of the state @xmath15 .",
    "qualitatively , we can say that in such case the coupling @xmath20 is a small perturbation which does not affect much the dynamics of the state @xmath15 which is an eigenstate in the case @xmath21 .",

    "( [ eq : partfuncsphereepsilon ] )    apart from the technical aspects of the development of the calculations ( on the hypercube and on the hypersphere ) , the two threshold temperatures differ because of the regime where they apply and because of the scaling with the number of oscillators .",

    "we do not need such a threshold temperature to be much higher than the frequencies of the oscillators . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath154 applies in the limit of high temperature and can be applied even in the case of large number of oscillators .",
    "such threshold temperature scales as the inverse of the number of oscillators .",
    "this means that by assuming that the coupling constants scale as @xmath155 , one obtains that the threshold temperature @xmath154 is more or less independent of the number of oscillators .",
    "it is worth stressing that , according to the analysis reported in the appendix [ app : many_oscillators ] , the previous treatment is valid if one of these two conditions is satisfied : either @xmath156 @xmath73 or @xmath157 @xmath73 , always requiring @xmath105 .",
    "this means that we have to avoid those situations wherein some frequencies of the harmonic oscillators are smaller than @xmath158 while some other are larger . in other words , the bohr frequency of the transition @xmath159 should not belong to the frequency band of the oscillators",
    "the two possible scenarios are pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : reservoirscheme ] .    finally , we emphasize that usually @xmath153 significantly overestimates the temperature necessary to have the formation of zeno subspaces . moreover ,",
    "both @xmath160 and @xmath161 provide only sufficient conditions , so that in principle the zeno subspaces can appear for lower temperatures .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed a simple interaction model between a set of harmonic oscillators initially at thermal equilibrium and a three - state system .",
    "the latter system is prepared in a state ( @xmath7 ) which is not directly involved in boson - assisted transitions , but it is coupled to a state ( @xmath8 ) which undergoes transitions toward the third state ( @xmath162 ) due to the interaction with the bosonic part of the system .",
    "therefore there is a coupling between states @xmath8 and @xmath162 mediated by the harmonic oscillators responsible for transitions between such two states .",
    "the states @xmath7 and @xmath8 are directly coupled , but when the coupling between @xmath8 and @xmath162 mediated by the oscillators becomes very strong , a partitioning of the hilbert space neutralizes the direct coupling between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "there are two ways to make the coupling between @xmath8 and @xmath162 stronger : one possibility is to consider higher coupling constants @xmath163 s , which makes the effect occur even at zero temperature ; another possibility is to increase the temperature of the harmonic oscillators in order to make that those bosonic states which stronger couple the transitions @xmath62 ( due to an high value of @xmath164 ) are much involved in the dynamics .",
    "the latter case is the one considered in this paper .",
    "a very remarkable result is the scaling of the threshold temperature at which the zeno subspaces surely appear .",
    "indeed , in the limit of high temperature such threshold temperature scales as @xmath165 . therefore , assuming a larger and larger number of oscillators , keeping constant the quantity @xmath166 , we can rigorously assert that even in the presence of a bosonic bath the partitioning of the hilbert space occurs .",
    "instead , if the coupling constants @xmath163 s scale in such a way that @xmath166 significantly decreases when @xmath63 increases , then the temperature necessary to create the zeno subspaces becomes higher and higher and could become infinite when the number of modes of the bosonic field is infinite .    concerning the limitations of our analysis , it is important to clarify that the proof given in the appendix [ app : many_oscillators ] is based on a precise hypothesis about the diagonal entries of the matrix .",
    "such hypothesis translates into the assumption that the frequencies of the oscillators are localized in a finite band , so that it is possible to find a finite maximum and a non - vanishing minimum  both of the same sign  for the bohr frequencies related to transitions from state @xmath7 to state @xmath162 assisted by the acquisition of a bosonic quantum . in other words ,",
    "the bohr frequency @xmath158 should not be included in the frequency band that contains all the frequencies of the harmonic oscillators .",
    "therefore , the @xmath167 limit should be considered keeping finite the bandwidth of the reservoir and ensuring that such band does not intersect the bohr frequency @xmath158 .    as a final remark",
    ", we mention that if the subsystem @xmath168 is made of spins instead of harmonic oscillators , the previous effect seemingly does not occur .",
    "indeed , for the partitioning to happen we need to have @xmath72 , which is fulfilled for large @xmath169 , and then in the majority of the invariant subspaces .",
    "since such large numbers of excitations are not possible for a single spin , we guess that it is more difficult to obtain zeno subspaces through the interaction with spins at thermal equilibrium , at least assuming a structure of interaction analogous to the one we considered in this paper .",
