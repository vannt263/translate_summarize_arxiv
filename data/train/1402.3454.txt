    "studying the interaction of a quantum system with its environment plays a fundamental role in the development of quantum technologies .",
    "in fact , the quantum features of a system , such as the presence of quantum correlations or superposition of states , are very fragile and may be destroyed by the action of the environmental noise .",
    "decoherence may be induced by classical or quantum noise , i.e. by the interaction with an environment described classically or quantum - mechanically .",
    "the classical description is often more realistic to describes environments with a very large number of degrees of freedom , or to describe quantum systems coupled to a classical fluctuating field .",
    "recently , it has also been shown that even certain quantum environments may be described with equivalent classical models @xcite . since the environment surrounding a quantum system",
    "is often composed by a large number of fluctuators , it is legitimate to assume a gaussian statistics for the noise @xcite .",
    "moreover , the gaussian approximation is valid even in the presence of non - gaussian noise , as far as the coupling with the environment is weak @xcite .    among the different classes of open quantum systems ,",
    "a large attention has been paid to qubit systems subject to environmental noise inducing a dephasing dynamics @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "in studying the interaction of a qubit with an external field , it is often assumed that the typical frequencies of the system are larger than the characteristic frequencies of the environment . in these situations",
    "it is likely that the interaction with the environment induces _ decoherence _ through dephasing rather than _ relaxation _ via damping , i.e. by inducing transitions between the energy levels of the qubit .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing these kind of processes may be thus written as @xmath0 where , @xmath1 is the natural frequency of the qubit and @xmath2 is a classical stochastic field with a noise spectrum containing frequencies that are smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "the overall evolution of the system is obtained by averaging the unitary evolution governed by the hamiltonian ( [ hz ] ) over the realizations of the stochastic process .",
    "the resulting map @xmath3 corresponds to a pure dephasing which , in turn , leads to a number of interesting phenomena @xcite , including the abrupt vanishing of entanglement ( the so - called entanglement sudden - death @xcite ) and the sudden transition between classical and quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "pure dephasing has been also used to describe the dynamics of qubit systems in colored environments @xcite and to quantify their non - markovian character @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we do not assume the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hz ] ) , and address the dynamics of a qubit interacting with a gaussian field with both a longitudinal and a transverse component and with a broad spectrum , possibly including the natural frequency @xmath1 of the qubit . in particular , we are interested in analyzing the conditions under which the dynamics may be effectively approximated by a unitary operation or a pure dephasing without relaxation . addressing",
    "the problem for a generic transverse stochastic field is a challenging task @xcite since a high order cumulant expansion is involved .",
    "we thus restrict attention to the quasi static regime , where the dynamics of the external field is assumed to be slow , and discuss in some details the conditions to obtain an effective dephasing in this regime .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ s : qb ] we describe the dynamics of a qubit interacting with an external random classical field having nonzero longitudinal and transverse components . in section [",
    "s : tr ] we assume a pure transverse field and analyze the conditions under which its effects may be neglected , i.e. the dynamics may be effectively approximated by a unitary operation or a dephasing , whereas in section [ s : fl ] we consider both components and again analyze the regimes where the dynamics corresponds to dephasing without relaxation .",
    "section [ s : out ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider a two level system interacting with an external fluctuacting field @xmath4 , having both a longitudinal and a transverse component , denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the system hamiltonian is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the qubit energy and the @xmath7 are pauli matrices .",
    "our purpose is to study under which conditions the dynamics governed by the hamiltonian , and by the average over the stochastic processes @xmath2 and @xmath5 , may be described by a dephasing map , such that the added term @xmath8 does not affect the population of the qubit . the time - dependent coefficients @xmath9 describe stationary gaussian stochastic processes with zero mean and covariance @xmath10 , in formula @xmath11_{b_i}&=0\\nonumber\\\\   [ b_i(t)b_i(t')]_{b_i}&=k_i(t - t')\\qquad i = x , z\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath12_{b_i}$ ] denotes the average over the process @xmath9 .",
