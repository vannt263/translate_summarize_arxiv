    "the interplay between interactions and disorder is a long - standing problem in condensed matter physics . in one - dimensional systems ,",
    "in which the interactions can be treated exactly using the luttinger liquid theory@xcite and bosonization,@xcite a lot of progress to understand the effects of impurities has been made over the last 20 years .",
    "it was shown that repulsive interactions such as the coulomb interactions renormalize the impurity strength , such that at low energy even a weak impurity has a very strong effect and can cut the wire into two pieces.@xcite this translates into a reduction of the local density of states ( ldos ) at low energies , and the ldos decays to zero as a power law.@xcite at high energies , the effect of the impurity consists in a small power - law correction of the unperturbed ldos .",
    "the two power laws are characterized by two different exponents which depend on the interaction strength .",
    "these two regimes have been described perturbatively in the framework of the luttinger liquid model by various techniques , e.g. , the renormalization group,@xcite the keldysh formalism,@xcite or the duality between the weak impurity regime and the strong impurity regime.@xcite these techniques have as starting point either the infinite clean wire , or a system of two decoupled semi - infinite wires and , next , one considers small impurity - induced perturbations around these points .",
    "however , the transition between the two limits can not be captured by perturbative techniques .",
    "then , special techniques such as the bethe ansatz,@xcite refermionization methods,@xcite approaches based on resummation of terms in perturbation theory,@xcite or non perturbative - in - tunneling fixed - point method@xcite are necessary",
    ". it would be thus of great interest to be able to capture this transition by more direct methods such as the dyson equation technique we propose here .",
    "this is our first motivation to tackle this problem .",
    "our second motivation comes from a more applied perspective , and consists in providing a method to disentangle the effects of the metallic contacts which are inevitably connected to an interacting quantum wire ( qw ) in the measurement process , allowing one to have access to the interacting physics in the wire and eventually evaluate the strength of the interactions therein .",
    "the first attempts to measure the interaction parameters in a qw rely on the existence of the impurity - induced power - law corrections in the ldos detectable in conductance measurements.@xcite however , this has turned out to be a very difficult task , due especially to the incertitudes in fitting power - law dependencies over small intervals of energies * ? ? ?",
    "subsequently , other more direct measurements such as the shot noise have been proposed.@xcite unfortunately , it was shown that in such experiments , the metallic contacts prevent one from having access to the value of the interacting parameter.@xcite    the modelization of the metallic contacts provides us with two challenges .",
    "the first consists in the introduction of two impurities at the two junctions between the wire and the contacts . in general , the impurity potentials induced by these impurities are neither too small nor too large , and a non perturbative technique would be required to capture the transition between small and large values of the impurity potential .",
    "secondly , the physics of the system is greatly affected by the fact that the two semi - infinite metallic leads are non interacting , and thus a correct modelization of the system needs to include the spatial inhomogeneity in the interaction strength . as mentioned above",
    ", this inhomogeneity is what blocks one from having access to the value of the interacting parameter via shot noise experiments .",
    "these two aspects need to be taken into account to correctly evaluate the effect of the contacts .    the first issue , i.e. , the transition between the small and large impurities is an interesting problem which is present even in the absence of interactions . for a non - interacting system",
    "it has been shown that a transition from a fabry - perot to a coulomb - blockade regime occurs when the impurity strength increases .",
    "thus , for weak impurities , fabry - perot oscillations arise in the dependence of the ldos on energy.@xcite for large values of the impurity potential , the system is cut into a central quantum - dot - like region plus two semi - infinite wires , and the energy spectrum of the central part consists in discrete levels whose energy is proportional to its inverse length .",
    "@xcite the width of these states becomes smaller and smaller when the central part is more and more disconnected from the leads .",
    "understanding the effect of the interactions on the transition between the coulomb - blockade and the fabry - perot regime is a long - standing mesoscopic physics problem .",
    "various other factors also come into place , such as lifting the degeneracy between the energy levels when coulomb interactions are present .",
    "this is especially interesting in the spinful case : in this situation , the periodicity of oscillations in the ldos is expected to change between the coulomb - blockade and the fabry - perot regimes ; various works have been trying to approach this problems using different methods.@xcite    in this work , we develop an approach that allows one to study the interplay between impurities and interactions for arbitrary size impurities .",
    "our approach is based on writing and solving the dyson equations for a wire with one or two impurities . in this paper",
    ", we consider an infinite homogeneous interacting qw and the corresponding form for the fermionic green s functions .",
    "this allows us to study the first aspect of the problem raised by the presence of the contacts , i.e. , the presence of one or two impurities of arbitrary size .",
    "we start with the study of an infinite homogeneous interacting qw with a single impurity .",
    "we calculate the form of the friedel oscillations as well as the dependence of the ldos with energy . for weak impurities we retrieve the expected luttinger liquid power - law dependence of the impurity with energy at both low and high energies . for strong impurities at either high energies or large distances to impurity , we recover a power - law dependence with the same exponent @xmath0 as for the weak - impurity regime , consistent with the luttinger liquid predictions",
    ". however , at low energy and small distance , our approach fails to recover the transition to a different power - law exponent characteristic to breaking the wire into two independence pieces , i.e. , with exponent ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this comes from a drawback in the approximation used in our approach , which consists to neglect terms mixing impurity potentials and coulomb interactions in the dyson equation .",
    "this nevertheless does not affect the behavior at large distances / energies , and the validity of the main results of this paper , i.e. , the dependence of the ldos in a wire with two impurities and the transition from the weak - impurity regime to the strong - impurity regime .    for a homogeneous interacting wire with two impurities ,",
    "we find that the main effect of interactions is to modify the amplitude of the fabry - perot oscillations , as well as the height and width of the coulomb - blockade peaks .",
    "more precisely , when interactions are taken into account , in the weak - impurity limit , the oscillations are reduced , while in the strong - impurity limit the peaks get wider and smaller .",
    "the interactions also affect the periodicity of the oscillations and the distance between the peaks .",
    "moreover , same as for a single impurity , power - law dependencies of the ldos with energy arise , and the ldos is reduced to zero on the impurity sites .",
    "another confirmation of the validity of our approach at large distance and high energy is the agreement between the form that we obtain for the ldos in a wire with two impurities , and that obtained via a completely different technique by anfuso and eggert in ref .   for a luttinger box .",
    "same as ref .",
    ", we find that at non zero fermi momentum there is an extra modulation in the space dependence of the ldos which arises solely in the presence of interactions .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath14 describes the coulomb interaction in the wire : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the density operator , and @xmath17 is the coulomb potential which is assumed to be short range due to screening effects by metallic gates or inter - wire coupling .",

    "we have developed an approach based on the dyson equations which has allowed us to study the ldos of an infinite interacting qw with two impurities of arbitrary strength .",

    "in particular , we recover an extra - modulation of the ldos oscillations in the presence of interactions , which is absent in the non - interacting system .",
    "this gives an extra confirmation that our approach is valid in that regime .",
    "our work provides an important first step in constructing a non perturbative approach to understand the interplay between interactions and arbitrary size impurities in one - dimensional systems .",

    "further improvements of this work would be to include long - range coulomb interactions and to take into account the terms mixing coulomb interactions and impurities potentials in the dyson equation in order to fix the low - energy discrepancies between our results and those predicted by the perturbation theory in the strong - impurity limit .",

    "<S> we calculate the density of states for an interacting quantum wire in the presence of two impurities of arbitrary potential strength . to perform this calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the coulomb interactions in the wire within the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory . after establishing and solving the dyson equation for the fermionic retarded green s functions , </S>",
    "<S> we study how the profile of the local density of states is affected by the interactions in the entire range of impurity potentials . </S>",
    "<S> same as in the non - interacting case , when increasing the impurity strength , the central part of the wire becomes more and more disconnected from the semi - infinite leads , and discrete localized states begin to form ; the width and the periodicity of the corresponding peaks in the spectrum depends on the interaction strength . as expected from the luttinger liquid theory , impurities also induce a reduction of the local density of states at small energies . </S>",
    "<S> two other important aspects are highlighted : the appearance of an extra modulation in the density of states at nonzero fermi momentum when interactions are present , and the fact that forward scattering must be taken into account in order to recover the coulomb - blockade regime for strong impurities . </S>"
