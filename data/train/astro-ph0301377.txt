    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow emission on timescales of hours to days , the historical standard for ground - based follow - up observations , can provide a robust measure of the global parameters of the grb such as its total explosive yield and the density of the circumburst medium on length scales of @xmath5 cm @xcite .",
    "early emission , on a timescale of tens of minutes and less , can offer insight into the details of the explosion , including the relativistic lorentz factor of the burst ejecta @xcite and the distribution of the circumburst medium on length scales @xmath6 cm . if the grb progenitor is a massive star , then this regime is expected to show the clear signature of a dense stellar wind ( density @xmath7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these two unique diagnostics , among others , have motivated searches for early optical emission from grbs .",
    "the first success came with detection of early optical @xcite and radio @xcite emission from grb990123 @xcite .",
    "this emission has been interpreted in terms of a reverse shock plowing back through the grb ejecta @xcite .    after nearly four years , early emission was recently discovered again from grb021004 @xcite and grb021211  @xcite .",
    "these discoveries were made possible by the prompt alerts of the _",
    "hete-2_satellite @xcite , and the wide field and high sensitivity of the 48-inch palomar oschin schmidt telescope ( p48 ) equipped with the neat camera @xcite .",
    "the increase in the number of robotic telescopes has allowed for intensive follow - up of both of these bursts during the critical early minutes to hours . here , we report the discovery of early optical emission and subsequent multi - wavelength follow - up observations of grb021211 .",
    "grb021211  ( hete trigger # 2493 ) was detected at ut 11:18:34 on 11 dec 2002 . with a duration of @xmath8s and a fluence of @xmath9erg @xmath10 ( 840kev ) ,",
    "the event is a typical long duration grb @xcite . at the time of electronic notification",
    "the _ hete-2_localization , although large ( 30-arcminute radius ) , was covered by the 1.1@xmath11 field - of - view of neat .",
    "we identified a new source that was not present in the palomar sky survey ( fig .",
    "[ fig : discovery ] ) and announced this as a possible optical counterpart of grb021211  @xcite .",
    "the best _ hete-2",
    "_  localization at the time of our discovery announcement was 14arcmin in radius ; a subsequent sxc localization produced the 2arcmin - radius circle shown in figure  [ fig : discovery ] .",
    "the position of the optical transient ( ot ) with respect to the guide star catalog  ii is @xmath12=08:08:59.858 and @xmath13=+06:43:37.52 ( j2000 ) with estimated uncertainty of 0.1arcsec in each axis .",
    "we continued monitoring with p48 , the 40-inch telescope at siding spring ( ss0 - 40 ) , and the palomar hale 5-m ( p200 ) telescope with jcam @xcite .",
    "photometry has been performed using the secondary calibrators of @xcite ; see table  [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "our optical source was subsequently identified in images obtained by several robotic telescopes and other ground - based facilities . in particular ,",

    "[ fig : moal ] we present the light curve obtained by combining data from these and other gcns with our data .",
    "_ near - infrared  _ we observed the afterglow in the near - infrared with the cassegrain f/70 low - background secondary and infrared camera @xcite on p200 on dec .  11.55 ut ( -band ) and with nirc @xcite on the keck - i 10-m telescope on dec .",
    "18.5 ut ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "nirc observations were photometered relative to sj  9116 and sj  9134 @xcite , and the p200 zero - point was determined from the nirc observations by reference to two secondary calibrators , s1 and s2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : discovery ] ) .",
    "our results are given in table  [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "_ radio  _ we searched for radio emission with the very large array ( vla ) ; our initial observation at @xmath15hr represents the earliest radio observation of any grb to date .",
    "we used pks  0734 + 100 for phase calibration and 3c147 and 3c286 for flux calibration .",
    "no counterpart to the ot is detected in any single observation .",
    "adding the data between 2002 december  20 and 2003 january  6 , we measure an 8.46-ghz upper limit of 35  at the position of the ot .",
    "peak flux densities at the position of the ot can be found in table  [ tab : radio ] .    separately , on dec  12.51 ut we carried out an observation in the 347-ghz band with the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clark maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "we used crl618 as the secondary flux standard . at the position of the ot we measure a 347-ghz flux density of @xmath16mjy",
    "to date , only three bursts have had early - time optical detections : grb990123 @xcite , grb021004 @xcite and grb021211 .",
    "grb021211  is at any epoch one of the faintest detected afterglows ; at early epochs it is more than 3mag fainter than grb990123 , and at later epochs ( @xmath3d ) it lies below the great majority of afterglow lightcurves ( fig .  [ fig : moal ] ) .",
    "as we show below , this is not the result of extinction in the host galaxy , so this burst reminds us that many so - called `` dark bursts '' may simply be faint ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "examining figure  [ fig : moal ] , we see that the early behavior of grb021211  bears a striking resemblance to the light curve of grb990123 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . the light curve can be considered as composed of two segments : an initial steeply - declining `` flash '' , @xmath17 with @xmath18 , followed by emission declining as a typical afterglow , @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding terms are `` flare '' and afterglow for the radio emission @xcite .",
    "the optical flash is thought to result from a reverse shock propagating into the grb ejecta @xcite , while the afterglow arises in the shocked ambient material swept up by the ejecta @xcite . for each shock",
    ", it is assumed that some fraction of the shock energy is partitioned into energetic electrons ( @xmath20 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the electrons are expected to follow a power - law distribution in energy , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "their collective emission follows @xmath25 at frequencies above the synchrotron peak frequency  and @xmath26 otherwise . below the self - absorption frequency ,",
    "synchrotron self - absorption becomes important , and above the characteristic cooling frequency , electrons lose their energy rapidly , on the timescale of the shock evolution .",
    "the forward and reverse shocks evolve differently .",
    "once the reverse shock has passed through the ejecta shell then no new electrons are accelerated and the shocked electrons cool adiabatically : @xmath27 , with the flux at @xmath28 ( the `` peak '' flux ) decaying as @xmath29 @xcite ; for @xmath30 the emission decreases even more rapidly .",
    "in contrast , electrons are continually added to and accelerated at the forward shock ; in the case of a uniform circumburst medium , @xmath31 is constant , and even above  the flux declines only slowly . since in a stellar wind - type circumburst medium ( @xmath32 )",
    "the reverse shock  is inevitably below the optical band , detection of long - lived reverse shock emission for grb021211  suffices to rule out wind models for this burst @xcite .",
    "the optical flux is already declining at the first epoch @xcite , when @xmath33s and @xmath34mag , corresponding to @xmath35mjy at a mean frequency of @xmath36hz ; here the superscript * identifies quantities taken at @xmath37s .",
    "this implies that @xmath38 , and constrains the time when the flare spectral peak  passes through the optical bandpass , , to be @xmath39 .",
    "since the observed decline at @xmath40 is not very rapid , @xmath41 , we have also that @xmath42 .",
    "the constraint on the time of the optical peak flux can be converted into a constraint on the relativistic lorentz factor @xmath24 of the grb ejecta . from @xcite",
    "we have @xmath43s ( thin - shell case ) , where is the time at which the reverse shock crosses the grb ejecta , @xmath44 is the circumburst particle density per cubic cm , @xmath45 is @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the isotropic - equivalent burst energy in units of @xmath48erg . since @xmath49 , we find that @xmath50 .",
    "using the prompt emission fluence of @xmath9  ( 840kev ) together with the proposed redshift of @xmath51 @xcite , we find an isotropic @xmath24-ray energy of @xmath52ergs for grb021211 .",
    "since this fluence is measured over a relatively narrow band , the full @xmath53-corrected fluence @xcite may easily reach @xmath48ergs , and it is reasonable to assume @xmath54 .",
    "following @xcite , in the absence of synchrotron self - absorption the radio flux will follow @xmath55 for times @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for times @xmath58 , where  is the time when @xmath59 passes through the radio band , @xmath60ghz .",
    "the value of  follows directly from the equation @xmath61 , and is equal to 1.35d in the limiting case @xmath62 . by this time",
    "the peak flux will have declined as @xmath63 .",
    "note that we are temporarily ignoring extinction effects , which are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : aglow ] below .    for @xmath39",
    ", we extrapolate the observed optical flux decay back in time as @xmath64 .",
    "the light curve of the radio flare is thus a direct function of : @xmath65 with the decay past  steepening to @xmath66 .",
    "our 3-@xmath0 upper limits at @xmath1d and @xmath67d are 110and 66 , respectively . for @xmath18 (  [ sec : aglow ] ) , the radio flux at @xmath67d is predicted to be @xmath6815 , independent of .",
    "the radio flux at @xmath1d is a strong function of , however , and eq .",
    "[ eq : fmrad ] gives @xmath69s and @xmath70mjy .    a lower limit on  implies an upper limit on the lorentz factor of the ejecta , @xmath71 .",
    "following the treatment of @xcite , however , we find that synchrotron self - absorption may be suppressing the radio flux below the level of eq .",
    "[ eq : fmrad ] , which would render this limit invalid .      a variety of afterglow lightcurves",
    "are possible @xcite but the form of sharp rise , plateau , and power - law decay is near - universal . given the bright flare , we can not constrain the rising portion of the afterglow lightcurve .",
    "we fit the flare as a power - law decay of index  and the afterglow as a constant flux , @xmath72 , which undergoes a power - law decay with index  for @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : moal ] ) .",
    "we first examine the constraints on the reverse shock decay .",
    "published gcn data are sufficient to constrain @xmath74 , and since @xmath75 @xcite , this implies that @xmath76 .",
    "the gap between the gcn data and our p48 measurements creates fitting degeneracies in the full model , so we fix  at three successive values , 1.50 , 1.63 , and 1.76 , and make fits to the full dataset . incorporating the range in parameter uncertainties covered in these three fits , we find that @xmath77 , @xmath78  and @xmath79s .",
    "note that because the flare dominates the afterglow emission at early times , our fitted @xmath72 should be considered a lower limit and our @xmath80 an upper limit .",
    "we can measure the power - law slope of the spectrum , @xmath81 , using our @xmath82 and  photometry near @xmath83d ( correcting first for galactic extinction of @xmath84=0.07mag ; @xcite ) . if @xmath85 at this time , then @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , implying little extinction in the host , @xmath89 in the observer frame . on the other hand , if @xmath90 at this time , then @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , corresponding to an intrinsic reddening of @xmath94 ( observer frame ) . in either case ,",
    "extinction within the host can not explain the @xmath682mag gap between the @xmath95-band lightcurve and those of most afterglows .",
    "since we do not know the location of  relative to the optical band , we adopt an average extinction correction of @xmath96 .",
    "this corrects our limiting peak flux of @xmath97  to an unextinguished flux of @xmath98",
    ".    from our model fits , @xmath99 , so that @xmath100 .",
    "we can use this relation along with eqs.4.3 and 4.5 of @xcite to estimate the circumburst density on length scales of @xmath101 cm .",
    "we find that @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",
    "since we have @xmath54 (  [ sec : flare ] ) , this implies either a low - density circumburst medium , or abnormally low values of @xmath21 or @xmath20 .    in the absence of self - absorption",
    ", the radio afterglow can be expected to peak at time @xmath104d . in the standard model",
    "the synchrotron peak flux @xmath105 remains constant as the peak frequency decreases , so we expect a radio peak flux of roughly 85 . prior to the peak time ,",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 . at the mean epoch of our summed image , @xmath108d",
    ", we expect @xmath109 , and our 2-@xmath0 upper limit is @xmath110 , a factor of two below the predicted level .",
    "we can estimate the self - absorption frequency ( eq .",
    "4.1 of @xcite ) in terms of the peak flux , @xmath111ghz .",
    "self - absorption will be effective in the case of a high circumburst density ",
    "unlikely on the basis of our @xmath44 estimate  or if @xmath105 is sufficiently large . in the latter case , at fixed frequency the effects of increasing self - absorption win out over the raw increase in flux .",
    "suppressing the radio flux by a factor of two requires @xmath112  ( @xmath113s ) , however , which seems unlikely .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed and expected fluxes can be due to an early jet break , @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "the optical light - curve , however , shows no sharp steepening out to @xmath115d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : moal ] ) .",
    "moreover , the measured fluence and proposed redshift @xmath51 for grb021211  are consistent with minimal beaming for a `` standard candle '' burst ( @xmath116ergs ; @xcite ) , so that an early jet - break seems an unlikely scenario to explain the suppression of the radio flux .    alternatively , the afterglow radiative corrections @xcite may be significant . in the slow - cooling regime ( @xmath117 ) ,",
    "radiative corrections can be substantial if  is large ( @xmath118 ) ,  is close to , or @xmath119 is close or equal to 2 .",
