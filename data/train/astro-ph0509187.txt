    "cosmic strings are linear topological defects of a gauge field which may have been formed in symmetry - breaking phase transition in the early universe .",
    "they are characterized by the tension @xmath0 , which is of order the square of the symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "their gravitational effect is measured by a dimensionless parameter @xmath1 .",
    "it is about @xmath2 for gut ( grand unified theory ) strings .",
    "cosmic strings had been studied as an alternative to inflation as a means of generating the primordial fluctuation .",
    "however , recent precise observations of the cosmic microwave background by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe and large scale structure by sloan digital sky survey have excluded the possibility of their dominant contribution to the primordial fluctuations .",
    "these observations give constraints on the dimensionless parameter which are typically @xmath3 @xcite . for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "despite the severe constraints , there has been a remarkable revival of interest . on the theoretical side , the possibility of superstrings of cosmological scale and their observability has been discussed by several authors especially in the context of brane inflation @xcite .",
    "they have almost the same observational consequences as the conventional cosmic strings .",
    "a striking feature of cosmic superstrings is their reconnection probability which differs from that of the conventional cosmic strings by many orders .",
    "thus the difference may allow us to distinguish them observationally @xcite . also it was argued in @xcite that cosmic strings should be present in a wide class of grand unified inflationary models .    on the observational side ,",
    "a possible detection of a cosmic string was recently made by sazhin et al .",
    "they claimed that a pair of galaxies csl-1 is a galaxy at @xmath4 gravitationally lensed by a foreground cosmic string .",
    "the observed image separation @xmath5 implies that somewhat large tension is needed , but this does not pose any serious problem if e.g. , one considers cosmic strings with high winding numbers @xcite .",
    "the string lens hypothesis is still to be explored , but if it is the case the system serves as an ideal laboratory to study very early universe . as emphasized by @xcite , a key observation to distinguish string lensing from the chance projection effect",
    "is deep wide - field imaging to identify other nearby lensing events ( see also @xcite for cosmic string lensing ) . in this paper , we study how such lensing events constrain the properties of the cosmic string .",
    "specifically , we compute analytically the distribution of image separations and show that it is sensitive to parameters which characterize the string , such as the redshift , the tension of the cosmic string and its coherence length . throughout the paper , we assume a lambda - dominated cosmology with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , and",
    "also assume that cosmic strings are non - relativistic .",
    "we consider a situation that background galaxies at redshift @xmath9 are multiply imaged by a cosmic string at redshift @xmath10 .",
    "the tension of the string is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "the angular separation between multiply imaged galaxies is given as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are angular diameter distances between lens ( string ) and source ( galaxy ) and observer and source , respectively , and @xmath14 is the angle between the string direction and the line - of - sight .",
    "we defined the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 which characterizes a cosmic string .",
    "( [ sep ] ) implies that it is difficult to obtain string parameters such as @xmath15 and the redshift @xmath10 , even if we examine a single string lens system in great details : assuming the redshift of the lensed galaxy is known , it is clear that we can constrain only the combination of @xmath15 , @xmath10 , and @xmath14 , and there is no way to separate this constraint .",
    "therefore we have to resort to other methods . in this paper",
    ", we consider the _ statistics _ of string lensing .",
    "below we derive explicit expressions for the distributions of image separations , and show that they are quite effective to determine these parameters separately .",
    "first we consider the case that the cosmic string is straight within the field - of - view we are interested in . as in @xcite , we study the number of other nearby lensing events , given the detection of one lensing event by a cosmic string . in this case , the number of lenses with image separations larger than @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is computed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the heviside step function , @xmath20 is the number distribution of background galaxies , and @xmath21 is the cross section diameter .",
    "the total ( projected ) length of the cosmic string is defined by @xmath22 : if the field - of - view is a circle with radius @xmath23 , it is simply given by @xmath24 . in the specific examples below , we assume the following form @xcite @xmath25\\frac{1}{z_0 } , \\label{ngal}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the total number density of galaxies . the cross section diameter @xmath21 is simply given by @xmath16 if we consider only those whose centers are multiply imaged .",
    "more strictly , it is possible that a part of a galaxy is multiply imaged . to compute this",
    ", we adopt an exponential disk @xmath27 for the surface brightness profile of galaxies .",
    "we assume @xmath28kpc throughout the paper . from this profile",
    ", we can compute @xmath29 as a function of limiting flux ratios @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "we note that @xmath32 , if the size of galaxy is much smaller than the image separation @xmath16 .",
    "the differential image separation distribution of lensed galaxies is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ n_cum_str ] ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the delta function .",
    "next , we consider the case that the coherent length of the string , @xmath35 , is much smaller than the field - of - view we search for lensed galaxies .",
    "put another way , the cosmic string is not straight but wiggling within the field - of - view .",
    "again , we study the number of other nearby lensing events , given the detection of one lensing event by a cosmic string . in this case",
    ", the distributions can be obtained by averaging eqs .",
    "( [ n_cum_str ] ) and ( [ n_diff_str ] ) over the angle @xmath14 with the weight of @xmath36 : @xmath37 @xmath38 it is unclear how the string total length @xmath22 is related with the coherent length @xmath35 .",
    "we connect these quantities by assuming a random walk of the string . in this case , @xmath22 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath23 is the radius of the field - of - view region .",
    "we note that the change of this relation only affects the overall normalization of the image separation distribution , and does not change the shape of the distribution itself .",
    "and dimensionless tension @xmath15 .",
    "the total numbers are @xmath40 ( solid line ) , @xmath41 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath42 ( dashed line ) for a straight string ( assuming @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 ( solid line ) , @xmath45 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath46 ( dashed line ) for a wiggling string . ,",
    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we compute the distributions of image separations of lensing events around one lensing event .",
    "we assume wide - field deep ( the limiting magnitude of @xmath47 ) imaging by , e.g. , suprime - cam on the subaru telescope @xcite , and adopt @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ( from eq .",
    "( [ ngal ] ) this implies the median galaxy redshift @xmath51 ) . to illustrate how sensitive the distributions depend on string parameters , we consider the following three sets of parameters ; ( @xmath10 , @xmath15)=(0.1 , @xmath52 ) , ( 0.2 , @xmath53 ) , and ( 0.3 , @xmath54 ) .",
    "note that these parameter are chosen so as to be consistent with the possible detection of a cosmic string @xcite where the image separation is @xmath5 and the redshift of lensed galaxy is @xmath55 .",
    "we ignore the limiting flux ratio and adopt @xmath56 .",
    "we show the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : sep ] .",
    "we show both straight and random walk cases : for the latter case , we assumed the correlation length to be @xmath57 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the shape of the distributions are quite sensitive to string parameters .",
    "this means that the statistics of lensed galaxies in the field can become a powerful way to constrain these parameters .    the dependence of the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sep ] on @xmath15 and @xmath10 can be understood from the following simple considerations .",
    "first , the maximum image separation increases monotonically with increasing @xmath15 , simply because the maximum separation is equal to @xmath15 ( see eq .",
    "( [ sep ] ) ) .",
    "the width of the distribution is related to the string redshift @xmath10 through a factor @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ sep ] ) .",
    "the factor rapidly increases as we increase @xmath9 from @xmath10 , and asymptotically approaches to unity .",
    "therefore , if the string redshift is low the factor is already close to unity at @xmath59 which is typical redshift of source galaxies , while the factor is still changing at @xmath59 when the string redshift is higher .",
    "these explain qualitative behaviors of the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sep ] .    .",
    "for cases of both straight ( _ left _ ) and wiggling ( _ right _ ) strings , we plot @xmath60 with five different @xmath30 : from upper to lower solid lines , we set @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    next we study the dependence of the distributions on the limiting flux ratio @xmath30 . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sep_flim ] .",
    "we find that the distributions are not affected very much by @xmath66 . even if we adopt @xmath67 , the large number of lenses is still predicted .",
    "this implies that a substantial fraction of lensed pairs should have flux ratios close to unity .",
    "we showed in the previous section that the distribution of image separations of galaxies lensed by a cosmic string will be an effective way to determine the tension and redshift of the cosmic string . to demonstrate this , we perform likelihood analysis of csl-1 field with lens candidates presented by sazhin et al",
    "they identified about 9 lens candidates in the @xmath68 field with csl-1 at the center . while it is unclear how likely these are galaxies pairs lensed by a cosmic string because of the lack of any detailed information on these lens candidates , we adopt 5 lens candidates with flux ratio larger than @xmath63 , as well as csl-1 itself , as `` true '' gravitational lens events to see how the model parameters are constrained by this kind of additional lens events .",
    "we assume wiggling ( random walk ) cosmic string throughout this section , since the positions of the lens candidates clearly indicate that the cosmic string can not be straight ( see @xcite ) .    , @xmath69 , @xmath70 confidence limits .",
    "the dotted line in the @xmath10-@xmath15 plane indicates the limit of the prior given by eq .",
    "( [ pri ] ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we compute the number distribution of lenses with eqs .",
    "( [ n_cum ] ) and ( [ n_diff ] ) .",
    "the lens candidates are identified in the medium deep images with limiting magnitude of @xmath71 , which correspond to @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( the median galaxy redshift @xmath74 ) . from this , we compute the likelihood as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total number of lenses with image separation larger than @xmath77 ( lenses with smaller image separations are quite hard to be identified ) expected in the field , @xmath78 is the observed number of lenses , @xmath79 is the image separation of @xmath80-th lens .",
    "we compute likelihoods as a function of three parameters ; the string redshift @xmath10 , the dimensionless tension @xmath15 , and the correlation length @xmath35 , and derive constraints on these parameters . in doing so , we include the following prior @xmath81 which originates from the fact that the redshift of csl-1 is @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting constraints are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ( which corresponds to @xmath85 at @xmath86 ) .",
    "we find that we can place tight constraints on string parameters even from 6 lens events only : @xmath87 and @xmath88 at @xmath69 confidence limit .",
    "therefore we conclude that the statistics of lensing by a cosmic string are useful way to constrain properties of the cosmic string . assuming the best - fit parameter set , we predict that the wide - field imaging of the field ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] for the specific setup ) will be able to detect @xmath89 lens candidates with the image separations larger than @xmath77 .",
    "in this paper , we derived explicit expressions for the distributions of image separations of lensing by a cosmic string .",
    "we computed the number of nearby lensing events around one lensing event by a cosmic string .",
    "we considered both cases that the string is straight and fully wiggling in the field - of - view we are interested in .",
    "it is quite hard to characterize a cosmic string from detailed investigation of a single lensing event , because of the degeneracy between parameters .",
    "we have found that the statistics of lensing events , i.e. , comparing the theoretical number distribution of image separations with observations is an effective way to break the degeneracy and determine string parameters such as the string redshift and tension .",
    "we have shown that the detection of only several nearby lensing events is enough to place interesting new constraints on parameters .",
    "our calculation indicates that a deep wide - field imaging in the field of string lens event will be able to find hundreds of additional lensing events , which offer valuable information on the cosmic string and hence the very early phase of our universe .    in this paper",
