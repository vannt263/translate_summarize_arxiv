    "semiconductor lasers are important components of optical technologies with numerous applications in daily life .",
    "their large scale use , e.g. in optical networks , has raised the need for reduced power consumption as a contribution to global energy savings . therefore , semiconductor nanolasers are at the forefront of current research to meet this need .",
    "recently , semiconductor nanowires have attracted widespread interest due to their unique combination of electrical and optical properties , which allow for applications as photonic and plasmonic lasers or as resonators for the observation of polaritonic effects.@xcite many applications rely on sophisticated geometries , where bending and folding of individual wires or the interaction between multiple wires play an important role in determining the optical properties.@xcite    on the other hand , the performance of a nanolaser device relies heavily on the electronic properties of the respective gain material . in nanowire laser systems , the gain is typically provided by the wire material itself .",
    "alternatively additional constituents such as incorporated transition metal or rare - earth ions can provide the gain . for semiconductor active materials ,",
    "the single - particle electronic states are defined by structural properties such as material composition , quantum confinement and strain .    the optical properties , however , are additionally influenced by many - body effects of the excited carriers . in the weakly excited regime , these effects give rise to excitonic absorption peaks lying below the band gap .",
    "in the high excitation regime , the excitation dependence of the optical gain is dominated by phase - space filling and many - body energy renormalizations .",
    "coulomb enhancement of interband transitions , screening , and excitation induced dephasing additionally contribute to magnitude and spectral distribution of the gain @xcite .",
    "therefore , a predictive theory of nanowire lasing needs to incorporate these effects as well as the device geometry .",
    "numerical methods like finite - difference time - domain@xcite ( fdtd ) simulations allow for the modelling of electrodynamics in arbitrarily complex geometries and can be readily extended to solve additional differential equations describing dispersive , nonlinear or gain media .",
    "however , while this approach has been used to model semiconductor media using incoherently coupled two - level systems @xcite , the combination of the fdtd method with a proper semiconductor gain model , including excitonic and band - gap renormalization effects is still lacking . to bridge this gap ,",
    "we present a theoretical model combining semiconductor bloch equations@xcite with the fdtd method .",
    "the coulomb interaction is treated in the screened hartree - fock approximation@xcite to provide for an accurate description across different excitation density regimes .",
    "since nanowire lasing modes usually have a non - trivial polarization structure , several bands and electronic transitions need to be included in order to describe the coupling of different electric field polarizations to the material .    as a first application , we present simulations of the dynamics of an optically pumped semiconductor nanowire , including the amplification of spontaneous emission up to the onset of lasing and the selection of transverse and longitudinal modes .",
    "to investigate light - matter interaction in semiconductor nws , we solve maxwells equations @xmath0    @xmath1    @xmath2    using the standard fdtd algorithm @xcite and taking into account the full vectorial character of the electric field @xmath3 , the magnetic induction @xmath4 and the dielectric displacement @xmath5 .",
    "the passive material response is incorporated in a nondispersive dielectric constant @xmath6 , while the dynamic action of the semiconductor material is represented by the polarization @xmath7 , which includes contributions from all optical transitions from valence bands with indices @xmath8 to the conduction band ( index @xmath9 ) at electron bloch vectors @xmath10 .",
    "we assume the microscopic polarizations @xmath11 as well as the occupation numbers @xmath12 for conduction - band electrons ( @xmath13 ) and for holes in the different valence bands ( @xmath14 ) to depend only on the absolute value @xmath15 of the bloch vector , so that the polarization in a bulk semiconductor takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dipole matrix element attributed to the transition from valence band @xmath8 to the conduction band and coupling to the electric field component pointing in direction @xmath18 . to explicitly take into account the nature of the active material ,",
    "we employ semiconductor bloch equations ( sbe ) @xcite in the screened exchange - coulomb hole approximation @xcite .",
    "this leads to equations of motion for the microscopic interband polarisations @xmath11 of the form @xmath19 with the renormalized rabi frequency @xmath20 using the screened coulomb matrix elements @xmath21 .",
    "we include an excitation density dependent dephasing @xmath22 caused by carrier - carrier coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "transition energies are defined by the band gap energy @xmath23 and the renormalized single - particle energies @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the effective masses .",
    "the coulomb hole contribution can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the unscreened coulomb matrix element @xcite .",
    "the screened and unscreened coulomb interaction is given by @xmath28 with screening wavenumber @xmath29 and by @xmath30 respectively .",
    "to evaluate these matrix elements numerically , we utilize an angle - averaging procedure , which is described in @xcite .",
    "this yields the matrix elements @xmath27 and @xmath21 that are used above .",
    "similar to the equation of motion for the transition amplitudes , the time evolution of the occupation numbers is given by @xmath31 for electrons and by @xmath32 for holes in the valence band @xmath8 .",
    "the first term describes the carrier excitation by the electromagnetic field .",
    "the two terms involving @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively phenomenologically describe non - radiative recombination and intra - band relaxation of carriers towards fermi - dirac distributions with a band dependent fermi level .",
    "@xmath35 @xcite . to allow for the relaxation between valence bands , an additional contribution @xmath36 is included in the equation of motion for the hole populations , where @xmath37    to allow for the description of spontaneous emission in our semiclassical model , we add noise terms as previously used for two - level systems@xcite @xmath38 @xmath39 to the right hand side of equation [ eq : psi ] as well as @xmath40 @xmath41 to the right hand sides of equations [ eq : number ] and [ eq : number2 ] .",
    "@xmath42 are gaussian random numbers with zero mean .",
    "the individual @xmath11 are coupled by the coulomb interaction , therefore excitonic effects are included in the spontaneous emission , which lies mainly below the band gap .",
    "the intra - band relaxation processes associated with @xmath43 and @xmath44 are microscopically caused by a combination of carrier - carrier coulomb scattering and carrier - phonon scattering and redistribute the populations towards quasi - fermi distributions .",
    "these processes do not describe a decay of polarization and conserve quasi - particle densities .",
    "therefore associated additional noise amplitudes can be safely neglected , at least for high excitation densities and in the lasing regime .",
    "simulations of photonic nanostructures require a fully vectorial treatment including the coupling of all electric field components to the material system .",
    "therefore the consideration of all transition elements between bands in a relevant frequency range is necessary . in this section",
    "we discuss the involved bands and the possible transitions for the case of 2 - 6 semiconductors with wurtzite structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstwosix ] ) .",
    "these materials are most interesting in the case of nanowire lasers .",

    "photonic wires with wurtzite structure are birefringent with the optical axes pointing in @xmath45-direction along the wire .",
    "the optical properties arise from transitions between three p - like valence bands ( occupation numbers @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) and a single s - like conduction band ( occupation number @xmath48).@xcite     ( color online ) . bands and transitions with their relative dipole matrix elements for the case of a 2 - 6 semiconductor with wurtzite structure and a crystal axis pointing into the @xmath45-direction .",

    "valence band @xmath54 can be safely neglected in a description of the optical properties , since its energy is significantly set off from the fundamental band gap .",
    "thus , the relevant occupation numbers for our model are @xmath57 .    to find all possible transitions and their respective relative dipole matrix elements ,",
    "states are expanded in spin- and orbital angular momentum eigenstates @xmath58 using clebsch - gordan coefficients . assuming conservation of electron spin , allowed optical transitions are characterized by a conservation of angular momenta of photons and electrons .",

    "the lasing emission continues with a slowly falling slope , leading to a strongly asymmetric shape of the emitted pulse sequence . due to interference between the lasing modes the emitted pulse sequence has a rather irregular temporal shape .    the @xmath15-resolved inversion of the transition from valence band @xmath49 to the conduction band is plotted in fig .",

    "however others require the material model to be reproduced .",
    "for comparison , we include a simulation of a nanowire laser where the active material is described by a two - level system , as often employed in fdtd simulations .",
    "the transition between the two levels couples equally to all three field polarizations ( see inset of fig.[fig : spattempdynamics2lvl](a ) ) . the material is assumed to be excited to an upper - level occupation of @xmath106 and material parameters are tuned to fit the gain profile of highly excited cds .",
    "we observe , that even though the gain profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spattempdynamics2lvl](c ) ) looks very similiar to that of the semiconductor material , the resulting lasing dynamics differ considerably . as opposed to the full model",
    ", there is no prolonged stimulated emission after the initial peak , leading to a more symmetric temporal shape of the emission .",
    "[ fig : spattempdynamics2lvl](a ) ) .",
    "since the shape of the gain profile of a single two - level system does not change as carriers are depleted , the spectral shape of the emission stays approximately constant during lasing action ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spattempdynamics2lvl](b ) ) . lasing emission stops as soon as the dominant mode no longer fulfills the lasing condition .",
    "we presented a theoretical model for the simulation of light - matter interaction in arbitrarily shaped semiconductor structures based on the fdtd method and the semiconductor bloch equations .",
    "we adapted the model to the band structure of 2 - 6 semiconductors and presented simulations of the lasing dynamics of an optically pumped cds - nanowire .",
    "our model allows for the description of semiconductors across the whole range of excitation conditions from the weakly excited case to the lasing regime and is not limited to equilibrium distributions of carriers either in bloch vector or real space .",
    "thus it is especially interesting for lasing simulations where excitation conditions vary strongly across space or time as well as for simulations of nonlinear optical phenomena in the weakly to moderately excited regime .",
