    "much of the power of information theory , classical and quantum , comes from the separation of information from its physical carriers .",
    "this level of abstraction favors a black box approach describing physical processes by their input - output relations in discrete time steps . for quantum systems",
    "the most general black box is described by a trace preserving and completely positive map  a quantum channel .",
    "this might describe the application of a gate in a quantum processor , a quantum storage device , a communication channel , or any open systems dynamics where one merely has partial access to the relevant degrees of freedom . in any case",
    "it can be considered a snapshot of a physical evolution after a certain time .    in the present letter",
    "we investigate what such a snapshot reveals about the intermediate continuous time evolution , in particular regarding the markovian and hence memoryless or non - markovian character of the process .",
    "this will link the black box approach to the dynamical theory of open quantum systems .",
    "remarkably , fixing a single point in time enables us to gain non - trivial information about the path along which the system has or has not evolved , even without making additional assumptions about the physics of the environment and its coupling to the system . on the one hand",
    "this analysis thus provides a model - independent means of investigating non - markovian features . on the other hand it tells us which type of evolution is required for the continuous realization of theoretically given quantum channels .    on the experimental side recent progress in the field of quantum information science showed more and more precise determination of input - output relations via _ quantum process",
    "tomography_. this has by now been achieved in various systems including nmr @xcite , ion traps @xcite , linear optics implementations @xcite and solid state qubits @xcite .",
    "some of them , in fact , rely on the a priori assumption that the process in fact is markovian . in the study of open quantum systems as such , non - markovian processes also move to the center of interest @xcite .",
    "in general , a precise understanding of decoherence and dissipation processes is vital for further improvements and for the design of adapted error correcting codes and fault - tolerant schemes .",
    "most notably in this context non - markovian effects are known to require a careful analysis @xcite .",
    "before we start , some remarks concerning the central notions ` markovian ' and ` time - dependent markovian ' are in order",
    ". we will call a quantum channel _ markovian _ if it is an element of any one - parameter continuous completely positive semigroup , i.e. , a solution of a master equation with generator in lindblad form .",
    "if the generator depends on time , we use the term _ time - dependent markovian _ instead . in both cases",
    "the continuous evolution is memoryless in that at any point in time the future evolution only depends on the present state and not on the history of the system .",
    "our findings are :    * the sets of ( time - dependent ) markovian channels are strictly included within the set of all quantum channels and exhibit a non - convex geometry . * for arbitrary finite dimensions",
    "there is an efficient algorithm for deciding whether or not a quantum channel is markovian . * a computable measure is introduced which quantifies the markovian part of a channel . * for qubits a simple criterion for time - dependent markovianity is given together with a detailed analysis of the geometry of the sets of quantum channels .",
    "* examples of non - markovian processes are discussed . *",
    "an application in the theory of renormalization group ( rg ) transformations on quantum spin chains is outlined .",
    "throughout we will consider quantum channels on finite dimensional systems , i.e. , linear maps @xmath1 on @xmath2 ( density ) matrices , @xmath3 referred to as _ dynamical maps _ , reflecting the snapshot in time @xcite .",
    "when occasionally changing from schrdinger to heisenberg picture we will denote the respective map by @xmath4",
    ". it will be convenient to consider @xmath5 as a hilbert space @xmath6 equipped with the scalar product @xmath7 $ ] . on this space",
    "the map @xmath8 is represented by a matrix @xmath9={\\langlef_\\alpha|t|f_\\beta\\rangle}_{{\\mathfrak{h}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is any orthonormal basis in @xmath6 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will use matrix units @xmath11 as basis elements . note that a concatenation of two maps @xmath12 simply corresponds to a product of the respective matrices @xmath13 and that a density matrix @xmath14 in this language becomes a vector with entries @xmath15 .",
    "a useful operation is the involution @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it connects the matrix representation @xmath17 of the map to its choi matrix @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a maximally entangled state @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "complete positivity is then equivalent to @xmath22 . _ quantum channels",
    "_ are completely positive and trace preserving maps .",
    "the workhorse in the dynamical theory of open quantum systems are semigroups @xmath23 depending continuously on one parameter @xmath24 ( time ) and giving rise to completely positive evolution for all time intervals .",
    "two equivalent standard forms for the respective generators have been derived in refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath25 + \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta }   g_{\\alpha,\\beta } \\bigl(f_\\alpha\\rho f_\\beta^\\dagger -   \\frac12\\{f_\\beta^\\dagger   f_\\alpha,\\rho\\}_+\\bigr ) , \\label{normal2}\\ ] ] so @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is completely positive and @xmath30 .",
    "a channel will be called _ time ( in)dependent markovian _ if it is the solution of any master equation @xmath31 with time ( in)dependent liouvillian in _",
    "lindblad form _ ( [ normal2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath32",
    "given a quantum channel @xmath8 when is it markovian , i.e , of the form @xmath33 ? a priori , this might be a trivial question : as the channel fixes only one point within a continuous evolution , there might always be a ` markovian path ' through that point .",
    "as the attentive reader might already guess , this turns out to be not the case .",
    "one attempt to decide whether @xmath8 is markovian could be to start from a markovian ansatz and then calculate @xmath34 , e.g. , by numerical minimization",
    ". the major drawback of such an approach is the non - convex geometry of the set of markovian channels @xcite which inevitably leads to the occurrence of local minima .",
    "the following approach circumvents this problem and guarantees to find the correct answer efficiently by first taking the @xmath35 of @xmath8 and then deciding whether this is a valid lindblad generator of the form ( [ normal2 ] ) .",
    "the latter can easily be decided : a map @xmath36 can be written in lindblad form iff ( a ) it is hermitian @xcite , ( b ) @xmath37 corresponding to the trace preserving property and ( c ) @xmath38 is _ conditionally completely positive _ ( ccp ) @xcite , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the projector onto the orthogonal complement of the maximally entangled state ( see appendix ) .    before applying ( [ eq : ccp ] ) to @xmath41 we need to discuss some spectral properties of quantum channels . for simplicity we will restrict ourselves to the generic case where @xmath17 has non - defective and non - degenerate jordan normal form .",
    "hermiticity of a channel implies that its eigenvalues are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "jordan normal form_achievable via a similarity transform in the orthonormal basis in which the channel is expressed  is then @xmath42 where @xmath43 labels the real and @xmath44 the complex eigenvalues respectively .",
    "the @xmath45 s are orthogonal ( but typically not self - adjoint ) spectral projectors and @xmath46 is the flip - operator ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "projectors corresponding to complex conjugate eigenvalues are related via @xmath48 due to hermiticity of the channel which can in turn be expressed as @xmath49",
    ".    now @xmath8 is markovian iff there is a branch of the logarithm @xmath50 , defined via the logarithm of the eigenvalues in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jordan ] ) , which fulfills the above mentioned conditions ( a )  ( c ) .",
    "note that ( b ) is always satisfied if we start from a trace preserving map .",
    "moreover , hermiticity holds iff there is no negative real eigenvalue and branches for each complex pair of eigenvalues are chosen consistently so that the eigenvalues remain complex conjugates of each other .",
    "if @xmath17 has negative eigenvalues , the dynamics will not be markovian .",
    "the set of hermitian logarithms is then characterized by a set of integers @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the principal branch .",
    "the infinity of discrete branches looks a bit awkward at first glance , but the problem can now be cast into a familiar form . defining the matrices @xmath54 and applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : ccp ] ) to @xmath55 yields that @xmath8 is markovian iff @xmath56 for any set of integers @xmath57 .",
    "these matrices @xmath58 will be hermitian if @xmath17 has only positive real eigenvalues .",
    "note that the real solutions @xmath59 of eq.([eq : semi0 ] ) form a convex set @xmath60 ( @xmath61 being the number of complex pairs of eigenvalues ) . the present problem is then to decide whether @xmath62 contains an integer point .",
    "fortunately , this has an efficient solution in terms of a semi - definite integer program .",
    "that is , there is an algorithm @xcite which either finds a solution or guarantees that none exists within a run time of order @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of digits to which the input is specified @xcite .    in practice",
    "it turns out that checking the vicinity of the principle branch ( @xmath65 ) is typically sufficient . for qubit channels the problem simplifies further since it becomes ( at most ) one - dimensional as @xmath66 .",
    "hence , one has merely to maximize the smallest eigenvalue ( a concave function ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq : semi0 ] ) with respect to real @xmath67 and then check positivity for the two neighboring integers . note that again",
    ", this criterion does not necessarily reveal whether the dynamics was truly markovian , but whether it is consistent with it .",
    "when applying the above criterion to random quantum channels one finds that only a small ( but remarkably nonzero ) fraction of them is markovian , see fig .",
    "[ figure : set ] . in the following",
    "we will show how one can quantify the deviation from markovianity for the remaining channels .",
    "desirable properties of a measure of markovianity @xmath68 are :    * some form of normalization , e.g. , @xmath69 $ ] with @xmath70 iff @xmath8 is markovian , * computability , * continuity , * basis independence , i.e. , @xmath71 for all unitary channels @xmath72 and * an operational or physical interpretation .",
    "one possibility would again be to start from a distance measure @xmath34 which , however , looses much of its appeal by the apparent difficulties in computing it .",
    "we therefore propose a different approach based on the criterion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : semi0 ] ) . to this end",
    "let us regard @xmath73 as liouvillian of a master equation .",
    "if the channel is not markovian this will not give rise to completely positive , i.e. , physical , evolution for all times .",
    "however , adding an additional dissipative term might yield a physical markovian evolution .",
    "if we choose isotropic noise of the form @xmath74 with corresponding generator @xmath75 then @xmath76 becomes a valid lindblad generator for some @xmath67 iff @xmath77 exceeds @xmath78 hence @xmath79 is the minimum amount of isotropic noise required to make the channel markovian .",
    "note that @xmath79 can again be calculated by semidefinite integer programming and that it is basis independent in the sense of ( iv ) . in order to meet the normalization condition and to add an intuitive geometric interpretation to the physical one we use @xmath80\\;\\in[0,1]\\ ] ] as a _ measure for markovianity_. if @xmath81 is not hermitian we assign @xmath82 .",
    "this turns out to be precisely the factor by which the additional dissipation shrinks the output space of the channel in order to make it markovian . in order to see this note that the volume of the output space ( one might think in terms of the bloch sphere for @xmath83 ) is quantified by the determinant of the channel @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath84 , since @xmath85 $ ] is independent of @xmath67 . in this sense @xmath86 quantifies the markovian part of the channel @xcite .",
    "[ fig : plot ] ( a ) shows the markovianity of a convex combination @xmath87 of a unitary channel @xmath88 corresponding to @xmath89-rabi oscillation ( with hamiltonian @xmath90 ) and a dephasing process @xmath91 with @xmath92 this confirms the _ non - convex geometry _ in fig .  [ figure : set ] and shows that non - markovian effects can arise from an environment which is in a mixture of states each of which leads to a markovian evolution .",
    "interestingly , there also exist non - markovian processes that could have arisen from a markovian process when judged from a snapshot in time : the _ spin - star network _ in ref .",
    "@xcite has the property that for all times @xmath93 , and hence the channel is consistent with markovianity .",
    "this is perfectly physical , as in each time step there could have been a different memoryless evolution .",
    "[ fig : plot ] ( b ) in turn depicts the deviation from markovianity for the _ damped jaynes - cummings model _ , where the non - markovian character of the dynamics is clearly displayed @xcite .",
    "further examples where this competing effect of time scales can be observed are non - markovian models arising from spins coupled to _ structured baths _ with an energy gap as studied , e.g. , in ref .",
    "for deciding whether a channel is a solution of a time - dependent master equation we resort to generic qubit channels @xcite and content ourselves with presenting results whose technical proofs are published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a necessary and sufficient criterion is most easily expressed in the basis of pauli matrices @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath95 and @xmath96 be the ordered square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath8 is time - dependent markovian iff @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "this set contains all extremal qubit channels ( fig .",
    "[ figure : set ] ) , but only 17% of all channels @xcite . a paradigmatic example outside",
    "this set is @xmath100{\\mathbbm{1}}+\\rho^t\\big)/3,\\ ] ] which is the best physical approximation to matrix transposition ( or time - reversal or  in optics ",
    "phase conjugation when rotated by @xmath101 ) .",
    "this channels fails the criterion since @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "in fact , it belongs to the peculiar set of _ indivisible channels _ that can not be decomposed into a concatenation of two channels unless one of them is unitary .",
    "let us finally outline an application of the above results within an entirely different field : rg transformations for translational invariant states on quantum spin chains .",
    "the transformation introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite amounts to a coarse graining consisting of two steps : ( 1 . )",
    "build equivalence classes of states which only differ by a change of local basis , ( 2 . )",
    "merge neighboring sites and then iterate .",
    "both steps can be carried out explicitly if the state s matrix product representation @xcite uses matrices of finite dimension @xmath103 .",
    "each equivalence class then corresponds to a quantum channel @xmath8 on @xmath104 and merging neighboring sites is reflected by replacing @xmath8 with @xmath105 . in this sense",
    "the renormalization group is identified with a semigroup of quantum channels .",
    "if @xmath8 is markovian , we can replace the discrete block spin transformation by an equivalent continuous rg flow @xmath106\\ ] ] with @xmath107 parameterizing the scale of observation , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : semi0 ] ) .",
    "this allows then not only to coarse - grain ( @xmath108 ) but also to zoom in ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "indivisible channels are also special in this context : since there is no @xmath110 such that @xmath111 they correspond to starting points , i.e. , ultraviolet limits , of rg flows . in fact , the best physical approximation to time reversal in this way distinguishes the well known ground state of the spin-1 aklt hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we have introduced a framework to assess whether a given dynamical map describing a physical process could have arisen from markovian dynamics . to test this property we have provided necessary and sufficient conditions .",
    "we also introduced a natural measure of markovianity , quantifying the markovian content of a process .",
    "as such , we have provided the means to judge the forgetfulness of a physical process from a snapshot in time .",

    "this work has been supported by the elitenetzwerk bayern , the eu ( qap , compas , scala ) , the epsrc , microsoft research , and the euryi .",
