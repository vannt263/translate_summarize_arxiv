    "the detection of solar neutrinos by the r.  davis s chlorine detector and supernova 1987a neutrinos by the kamiokande water cherenkov observatory are milestones of modern science , _ nobel prize _ honored in 2002 . currently built and operating neutrino detectors are larger , much more efficient and are able to detect all neutrino species in a wide range of energy .",
    "there are already proposed new experiments with next - generation megaton - scale detectors , like hyper - kamiokande @xcite and uno @xcite .",
    ".differences between the sun ( main sequence star ) and the neutrino - cooled 20  m@xmath4 star ( @xcite , table  1 ) .",
    "approximate values ( orders of magnitude ) are given .",
    "the total energy carried by neutrinos for a 20  m@xmath4 neutrino - cooled star corresponds only to late stages of nuclear burning ( without supernova neutrinos ) . [",

    "star is located at a distance of 1  kpc . ]    to make detection of pre - supernova anti - neutrinos feasible we propose to supplement the existing and future water cherenkov detectors with some addition of nacl or gdcl@xmath5 ( see the proposition made by j.f .",
    "beacom and m.r .",
    "vagins _ gadzooks ! _",
    "@xcite ) to the water .",
    "neutrons produced in inverse @xmath6 decay are captured by gd or cl nuclei producing high energy ( above 8 mev ) gamma cascades .",
    "the addition of neutron absorbers is very important , because in a  pure light water neutrons are captured by protons and produce not detectable 2.2  mev gamma cascades , e.g. energy threshold in sk is about 5  mev .",
    "this modification has been proved to work in the salt phase of solar neutrino detection in the sno detector .",
    "the addition of nacl to the kiloton of heavy water increased the neutron capture efficiency and the associated cherenkov light  @xcite .",
    "neutron capture efficiency is different in every experiment and has to be calibrated with neutron source , as e.g. @xmath7cf in sno .",
    "background neutron events are disturbing pre - supernova neutrino detection , and thus should be carefully studied in every detector before the addition of the neutron absorber .",
    "the average rate of background neutron production from activity in the d@xmath8o region is 0.72 neutrons per day in the sno detector @xcite .",
    "these background events are produced mainly by deuteron photodisintegration ( not relevant for a light water detectors ) and due to the external - source neutrons .",
    "the background of neutrons in spallation products from energetic muons can be suppressed by a  veto following the muon @xcite .",
    "long - lived muon induced isotopes , which decay by the production of a neutron and a beta ( e.g. @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , can simulate the @xmath12 coincidence signature .",
    "thus , the study of muon induced spallation products in the neutron absorber nuclei is important .",
    "other major sources of the neutron background are : ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) interactions , fission of radioactive impurities , interactions of atmospheric and fission anti - neutrinos ( both natural and from reactors ) with protons .",
    "the neutrino flux from nuclear power plants depends strongly on location of nearby ones , and this factor has to be included in projects of future pre - supernova detectors .",
    "our results for @xmath15 pre - supernova star show that neutrinos ( particularly @xmath16 ) from last stages of nuclear burning in such a star are possible to detect .",
    "future detectors ( uno , hyper - kamiokande ) will be able to cover significant fraction of the galaxy .",
    "however , when we take into account relatively low , from typical experiment lifetime point of view , local _ core - collapse _ sn rate , of  1  per @xmath1100  yrs or less ( table  i of  @xcite , @xcite for overview , see however @xcite ) , only projects of long standing , namely nucleon decay and neutrino observatories , have chance to be operating during such an event . at present",
    "it is difficult to reliably estimate probability of successful neutrino - cooled start detection because of ( 1 ) uncertainties of local supernova rate , ( 2 ) unexplored yet variety of massive stars and their models , ( 3 ) unknown details of detection technique , especially neutron background level . making optimistic assumption of 10 events / day detectable and clearly distinguishable from background , we get ( using galaxy model @xcite and si burning event rate for 20 m@xmath4 star from table  [ tbl : events ] ) 1.7% galaxy coverage ( i.e. up to 2  kpc from earth ) for super kamiokande .",
    "next generation detectors uno and hyper kamiokande cover significant fraction 30% ( 7.5  kpc ) and 37% ( 8.2  kpc ) of galaxy disk stars , respectively . the highest galaxy supernova rate estimate of 1 per 10 years @xcite gives ( under above assumptions ) successful detection probability of 3% ( sk ) , 60% ( uno ) and 75% ( hyperk ) during 20 years of uninterrupted observation .",
    "benefits given by the detection of the pre - supernova neutrino signal can be divided into two sets : ( 1 ) those related to possible prediction of subsequent supernova event and ( 2 ) insight into processes related to deep interior of massive stars prior to its death .",
    "supernova event is an unpredictable phenomenon .",
    "astronomers await nearby supernova for 400 years .",
    "therefore , many of them speculate on the likely next galaxy event .",
    "the list of candidates includes betelgeuse , mira ceti , antares , ras algheti , @xmath17 vel , sher25 and eta carinae .",
    "unfortunately , the surface of these stars is unaffected by ( possibly ) dramatic nuclear and hydrodynamical processes deep inside .",
    "this is effect of @xmath18 years timescale of hydrogen envelope @xcite .",
    "no electromagnetic observation at any wavelength and resolution can help .",
    "only neutrinos carry informations on the current state of the stellar core .",
    "that s why only neutrinos could warn us before the supernova event .",
    "the case of sn1987a  @xcite unexpectedly revealed this fact .",
    "the silicon - burning neutrinos , although carry only about 1% energy compared to the main supernova neutrino burst , are possible to detect , as we showed in previous sections ( cf . table  [ tbl : events ] ) .",
    "the information about an incoming supernova is transmitted around 2 days star .",
    "this time strongly depends on the stellar mass ( cf .",
    "@xcite , table  i ) , and is in the range 0.7 - 18 days . ] earlier .",
    "the early warning would provide an additional time which may be crucial for preparation of all available observational techniques , including gravitational radiation detectors , and would allow us to be ready for the main neutrino burst from collapse and protoneutron star cooling .    in a very favorable case of a close star , much less than 1  kpc away pre - sn star at betelgeuse distance ( betelgeuse is actually a 15 m@xmath4 red giant at a distance of 185  pc ) which just entered the oxygen burning stage would produce in hyperk 45 neutrons / day during 6 months before its explosion . ] with operating megaton - scale neutrino observatory modified by addition of appropriate neutron absorber",
    ", we could expect detection of oxygen- and neon - burning neutrinos a few months before the explosion .",
    "the detection , however , would be more difficult than silicon - burning neutrinos , mainly due to lower luminosities l@xmath19 ( table  [ table2 ] ) , lower average energies @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) and smaller cross - sections ( table  [ table_cross ] ) .",
    "let s note , that the above speculations are no longer valid if the neutrino detection is _",
    "offline_. realtime ( _ on - line _ ) data analysis is strongly preferred from this point of view .",
    "the aim of our work is to show the feasibility of pair - annihilation neutrinos detection .",
    "we did not discuss the calculations of the neutrino luminosities , but actually the silicon burning is very complicated and  potentially numerically unstable stage  ( @xcite , sec",
    ". iv a-4 ) of stellar modeling , mainly due to similar timescales of nuclear burning and convection .",
    "the behaviour of spherically symmetric models employing the mixing - length convection appears to be completely different from 2d hydrodynamic models ( @xcite , epilogue ) .",
    "thus any observational data , even few detected events may be very important to constrain theoretical models . in a favorable situation of a close star with new - generation observatories",
    "we should be able to constrain the time - dependence of the neutrino flux and of the spectrum .",
    "the si - burning neutrino emission precedes a subsequent explosion event independently of the actual stellar death scenario .",
    "the sn1987a confirmed standard supernova mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , it is believed that at least some of the massive stars die in other ways .",
    "the most recent research is concentrated on grb - sn connection @xcite , their relation to failed supernovae @xcite and the core rotation @xcite .",
    "it is not yet understood why some massive stars become supernovae , hypernovae or even grbs .",
    "the detection of pre - supernova si - burning neutrinos together with the following observations of optical , neutrino and gravitational signals from the supernova and the identification of the progenitor would establish the relation of pre - supernova conditions and the explosion dynamics .",
    "let s note , that in case of the supernova shrouded in interstellar clouds , si burning neutrinos carry exclusive information on the progenitor .",
    "this article shows that detection of pre - supernova star neutrinos is a feasible new goal for neutrino astronomy .",
    "our simplified analysis may be extended to stars of different masses .",
    "the constant neutrino flux can be replaced with more realistic time - dependent flux generated by stellar evolution codes .",
    "the simple spectrum of pair - annihilation neutrinos can be augmented with detailed plasma- and weak - nuclear - neutrinos spectra .",
    "these refinements could change the results somewhat , not affecting our predictions as to the detection feasibility considerably . clearly , the most important circumstance is the distance to the next galactic supernova .",
    "it is also , however , the most indeterminable one .",
    "therefore , if we want to get results , we have to maximize our observation range .",
    "detectors like hyper - kamiokande , uno , or even better should be operating at the `` time zero '' .",
    "we thank k. grotowski and m. wojcik for helpful discussions and advice .",
