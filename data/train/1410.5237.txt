    "the study of strong interaction at low energies is one of the most important problems of the high energy physics .",
    "this can play a crucial role to explore the structure of mesons , baryons and vacuum properties of strong interaction .",
    "the tensor particles can provide a different perspective for understanding the low energy qcd dynamics . in recent decades there",
    "have been made great efforts both experimentally and theoretically to investigate the tensor particles in order to understand their nature and internal structure .",
    "the investigation of hadronic properties at finite baryon density and temperature in qcd also plays an essential role for interpretation of the results of heavy - ion collision experiments and obtaining the qcd phase diagram . the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm )",
    "experiment of the fair project at gsi is important for understanding the way of chiral symmetry realization in the low energy region and , consequently , the confinement of qcd .",
    "according to thermal qcd , the hadronic matter undergoes to quark gluon - plasma phase at a critical temperature .",
    "these kind of phase may exist in the neutron stars and early universe .",
    "hence , calculation of the parameters of hadrons via thermal qcd may provide us with useful information on these subjects .",
    "the restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperature requires the medium modifications of hadronic parameters @xcite .",
    "there are many non - perturbative approaches to hadron physics .",
    "the qcd sum rule method @xcite is one of the most attractive and applicable tools in this respect . in this approach ,",
    "hadrons are represented by their interpolating quark currents and the correlation function of these currents is calculated using the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "the thermal version of this approach is based on some basic assumptions so that the wilson expansion and the quark - hadron duality approximation remain valid , but the vacuum condensates are replaced by their thermal expectation values @xcite . at finite temperature , the lorentz invariance is broken and due to the residual @xmath6 symmetry , some new operators appear in the wilson expansion @xcite .",
    "these operators are expressed in terms of the four - vector velocity of the medium and the energy momentum tensor .",
    "there are numerous works in the literature on the medium modifications of parameters of ( psedo)scalar and ( axial)vector mesons using different theoretical approaches e.g. chiral model @xcite , coupled channel approach @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "recently , we applied this method to calculate some hadronic parameters related to the charmed @xmath7 and charmed - strange @xmath8 tensor @xcite mesons .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the properties of light @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath2 tensor mesons in the framework of qcd sum rules at finite temperature .",
    "we also compare the results obtained at zero temperature with the predictions of some previous studies on the parameters of the same mesons in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in next section , considering the new operators raised at finite temperature , we evaluate the corresponding thermal correlation function to obtain the qcd sum rules for the parameters of the mesons under consideration .",
    "last section is devoted to the numerical analysis of the sum rules obtained as well as investigation of the sensitivity of the masses and decay constants of the light tensor mesons on temperature .",
    "in this section we present the basics of the thermal qcd sum rules and apply this method to some light tensor mesons like @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 to compute their mass and decay constant .",

    "the currents contain derivatives with respect to the space - time , hence we consider the two currents at points @xmath20 and @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ correl.func.101 ] ) , but for simplicity , we will set @xmath26 after applying derivative with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "it is well known that in thermal qcd sum rule approach , the thermal correlation function can be calculated in two different ways .",
    "firstly , it is calculated in terms of hadronic parameters such as masses and decay constants .",
    "secondly , it is calculated in terms of the qcd parameters such as quark masses , quark condensates and quark - gluon coupling constants .",
    "the coefficients of sufficient structures from both representations of the same correlation function are then equated to find the sum rules for the physical quantities under consideration .",
    "we apply borel transformation and continuum subtraction to both sides of the sum rules in order to further suppress the contributions of the higher states and continuum .",
    "let us focus on the calculation of the hadronic side of the correlation function .",
    "for this aim we insert a complete set of intermediate physical state having the same quantum numbers as the interpolating current into eq .",
