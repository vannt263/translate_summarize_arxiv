    "enormous progress has been made in the last decade on understanding the nature of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and their role in the lifecycle of galaxies .",
    "the co - evolutionary behaviour of black holes and spheroids , as implied by the @xmath11 relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggests that most massive galaxies hosted an agn at some time . indeed , energy injection from agn through so - called `` feedback '' mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be the linchpin connecting the blue , star forming and massive red , dead elliptical galaxies , whether through direct energy input ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or as a somewhat more coincident product of the main quenching mechanism ( e.g. , major mergers could drive both agn and quenching ; @xcite ) .",
    "although feedback provides a key clue as to how galaxies evolve , there is a great deal of degeneracy in quenching prescriptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a promising avenue is constraining feedback models by examining the luminosity dependence to agn clustering in combination with the agn luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , current large quasar surveys typically track only the peak of the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) at @xmath12 and only probe the brightest quasars at @xmath13 , for example the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and the 2-degree field quasar survey ( 2qz ; @xcite ) . consequently ,",
    "quasar clustering measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) detect little luminosity dependence at @xmath12 , and provide incomplete constraints at @xmath13 .",
    "if we wish to have a complete picture of the true role of feedback in quenching star formation and black hole growth in galaxies , then an important tool is to probe agn ( in statistically significant numbers ) to luminosities below @xmath10 at high redshift and below host galaxy depths at low redshift . in the long - term , the next generation of survey facilities such as lsst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pan - starrs @xcite , des @xcite , and vst / vista @xcite , should produce sufficiently deep optical and near - ir photometry with which to address this goal . in the near - term ,",
    "any sufficiently large - area survey of agn that probes a wider luminosity range will blaze important observational and theoretical trails .",
    "this is particularly true of a large - area survey that contains the necessary color baseline ( typically mid - ir through optical / uv ) with which to simultaneously study agn host galaxies at @xmath14 and to characterize quasar photometric redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) out to @xmath15 and beyond .",
    "as such , herein we describe a novel method for efficient selection of agn from the combination of optical and mid - ir data that allows one to probe to the depths ( and areas ) that are required to compile the sort of data set that we have highlighted .",
    "as the existing overlap between sdss and mid - ir imaging grows , so too will our ability to collect statistically significant samples of faint high-@xmath16 quasars that are needed to probe the influence of quasar feedback on galaxy evolution .    in principle",
    ", differentiating quasars from stars using mid - ir ( mir ) colors is straightforward . at mir wavelengths , stars ( excepting the coolest brown dwarfs )",
    "are well - described by the rayleigh - jeans portion of a blackbody spectrum ( @xmath17 ) , resulting in quite blue colors , whereas quasars are much redder ( steeper / softer ; @xmath18 ) . for mir colors from",
    "_ spitzer _",
    "@xcite , it is not , in practice , quite this simple because _ spitzer _ s ( comparatively ) large pixels ( @xmath19 ) makes it difficult to distinguish point from extended sources , and thus a simple color cut to select agn suffers from considerable contamination from quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , judicious use of additional color cuts such as applied by @xcite and @xcite can be used to select quasars ( both obscured and unobscured ) with good efficiency and completeness for relatively bright mir sources . see @xcite for a recent review of agn selection techniques in the mir .    in this paper",
    "we explore ways to improve upon color selection of agns using mir colors .",
    "we particularly concentrate on 1 ) using sophisticated bayesian selection methods , to probe to fainter limits ( without additional contamination ) than allowed by standard color selection , 2 ) incorporating optical morphology information , and 3 ) combining mir and optical photometry , performing up to 8-d color selection .",
    "the latter approach increases completeness to high - redshift quasars ( particularly @xmath20 ) where standard mir color cuts are incomplete ( or heavily contaminated ) .",
    "in addition , we will show that coupling deep optical and mir data can overcome the loss of the two longest wavelength irac bandpasses when _",
    "spitzer s _ coolant is depleted .",
    "indeed , selection of quasars ( both type 1 and type 2 ) and photometric redshift estimation for type 1 quasars suffer relatively little from this loss .",
    "future coupling with deep uv , near - ir , and far - ir data from _ galex _ , ukidss , _ akari _ , _ wise _ , and _ herschel _ will allow for further improvements in both selection and photometric redshift estimation .",

    "the eight dimensions refer to the 8 unique colors afforded by sdss @xmath31 magnitudes @xcite and _ spitzer_-irac channel 1 - 4 flux densities .",
    "in addition , we perform 6-d selection of quasars using all 5 sdss filters and the 2 short wavelength irac bandpasses ( since the long wavelength bandpasses will not be available during _",

    "as such , we compile two combined mir+optical data sets .",

    "note , however , that the sdss s use of asinh magnitudes @xcite means that any object detected in one sdss bandpass will have meaningful magnitude measurements in all the other bandpasses ( even if they are nominally below the `` flux limit '' ) . unless otherwise specified , all sdss magnitudes herein are psf magnitudes that have been corrected for galactic extinction according to @xcite .      matching the combined 2-band irac data to the sdss optical imaging catalog from the 6th sdss data release ( dr6 ; @xcite ) with a @xmath34 matching radius ( irac has @xmath19 pixels and",

    "star - galaxy separation begins to break down and galaxies become significant `` stellar '' contaminants . at @xmath36 at @xmath37 for a type 1 quasars ) , roughly 10% of sdss point sources are likely to actually be galaxies .",
    "the colors of the extended sources are concentrated in three clumps in figure  [ fig : iracstargal ] ( red contours / dots ) ; understanding their origins is important for optimal object classification .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of extragalactic sources in the 1 - 8@xmath6 m range is composed of three main components : ( 1 ) the combined light of stellar photospheres has a peak at 1.6@xmath6 m @xcite and declines according to the rayleigh - jeans law at longer wavelengths ; ( 2 ) star - formation activity in the galaxy results in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission from dust with strongest features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 and 8.6@xmath6 m ; and ( 3 ) circumnuclear dust may be heated by the central agn resulting in continuum emission at mir wavelengths , which is typically well - represented by a power - law since the dust is emitting at a wide range of temperatures .",
    "the relative contributions of these components to the total spectrum determines the irac colors of extragalactic objectsm silicate absorption / emission feature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath38 if the feature is very broad ( irac channel 4 cuts off at @xmath39 m ) . ] . the colors of star - dominated and pah - dominated galaxies at a wide range of redshifts ( 01.6 ) are quite distinct in the irac bands from the colors of the thermal emission of circumnuclear dust allowing color separation of agns from galaxies of all types .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more details regarding how galaxies track through mir color space with redshift .",
    "in addition to matching the irac catalogs to the full sdss optical catalogs , we have also explicitly matched it to the 77,429 spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the sdss - dr5 quasar catalog @xcite . as the density of these known quasars is much smaller than the full sdss object catalog , it is not too cumbersome to extract irac photometry from the publicly available irac images of botes field . while our botes data reduction was simplistic compared to the xfls , swire , and cosmos data reductions , our analysis is substantiated by the lack of any difference in color as a function of redshift for the quasars in the botes region .",
    "in all , matching the sdss - dr5 quasar catalog to the irac data sets ( again using a @xmath34 matching radius ) resulted in 425 matches .",
    "the relative irac and sdss limits are such that all sdss quasars are detected in the mir .",
    "the additional 166 quasars as compared with @xcite come from the cosmos and botes fields .",
    "we supplement these quasars with additional spectroscopically - confirmed quasars with both _",
    "spitzer_-irac and sdss photometry from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , where the latter objects are @xmath40 quasars and the two former samples were restricted to broad - line , type 1 agns . in all we have compiled 515 known type 1 quasars with both sdss and irac detections ;",
    "the mir colors of these quasars are shown in figure  [ fig : iracstargal ] as green points .",
    "the sdss - dr5 quasar catalog covers nearly all of the areas of overlap between sdss and the swire fields .",
    "therefore , with the exception of several small - area fields and a part of the swire / elais - n1 area , these objects represent essentially all of the spectroscopically confirmed quasars that have been covered by both irac data and the final sdss data release ( dr7 ) .",
    "the next major opportunity to obtain a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed quasars with mir follow - up observations is with _ wise _",
    "@xcite , scheduled to launch in late 2009 .",
    "s 120@xmath6jy depth at 3.3@xmath6 m will be sufficiently sensitive to detect all of the @xmath41 quasars in the sdss catalog ( but generally not the @xmath42 objects that extend as faint as @xmath43 ) and will significantly increase the number of quasars with mir flux density measurements .",
    "the irac bandpasses are generally refereed to as channels 1 through 4 or as the 3.6@xmath6 m , 4.5@xmath6 m , 5.8@xmath6 m , and 8.0@xmath6 m bands , respectively . for a quasar spectrum with mir spectral index of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) ,",
    "the effective wavelengths of the irac bandpasses are actually closer to 3.52@xmath6 m , 4.46@xmath6 m , 5.67@xmath6 m , and 7.70@xmath6 m .",
    "one of the advantages of matching _",
    "spitzer_-irac data to sdss data is to gain morphology information that is not provided by irac s @xmath46 beam .",
    "however , the sdss psf degrades with magnitude and it is important to understand the limitations of the sdss data s morphological reliability . fortunately , with dozens on epochs of data on sdss stripe 82 ( the southern equatorial stripe ; @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) it is possible to robustly determine this reliability . for single - epoch data ,",
    "the sdss morphology is set by comparing the psf magnitude to the model magnitude .",
    "if the difference is larger than 0.15 magnitudes , it indicates that there is extended flux unmodeled by the psf and that the objects is likely a galaxy .",
    "however , with using co - added images that achieve a much deeper magnitude limit and better photometric reliability , one finds that a psf versus model magnitude difference of as little as 0.05 mag provides good discrimination between point and extended sources . comparing the single- to multi - epoch data",
    ", we find that , at @xmath49 , better than 96% of sdss - classified point sources ( single epoch ) are truly point sources .",
    "at that same limit more than 99% of extended sources are indeed extended .",

    "we then matched this combined sample with all the available irac catalogs ( including and in addition to those above ) to extract _",
    "spitzer_-irac photometry .",
    "only objects detected at both 3.6@xmath6 m and 4.5@xmath6 m were selected in the matched output .",
    "this final output table was then matched to the sdss dr6 catalog to select objects with both sdss and _ spitzer_-irac photometry .",

    "our selection method follows that of @xcite and is detailed therein . for multi - band imaging surveys ( such as the sdss )",
    "it is possible to perform object classification beyond traditionally adopted 2-d color cuts . in particular ,",
    "if the parameter space of interest is sufficiently populated by known objects , then these objects can be used as a `` training set '' to derive classifications within the parameter space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our algorithm of choice is based on kernel density estimation ( kde ) , weighted by a bayesian  prior \" .",
    "the kde aspect is that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) that is used to evaluate the classification is smoothed by some appropriate kernel function ( e.g. , a gaussian ) .",
    "our algorithm uses two training sets , one that represents the objects to be classified and one that represents everything else .",
    "we compute the n - dimensional euclidean color distance between some new object that we wish to classify and each of the training set objects .",
    "the new object is then classified based on how consistent its colors are with each training set ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one limitation of our current algorithm is that error information is not explicitly included ( cf . , @xcite ) ,",
    "although it is _ implicitly _ included by virtue of the training sets inherent error distribution .",
    "our bayesian selection method follows that of @xcite where technical details of the algorithm can be found , but the basics are quite simple .",
    "traditional quasar selection relies on simplistic `` color cuts '' , typically in 2-d .",
    "however , for the sdss ( and other current and future multi - band imaging surveys ) it is possible to perform higher dimensional object classification that goes beyond 2-d color cuts . in particular ,",
    "if there are enough known objects ( per increment of parameter space ) of the type that one is searching for , then they can be used as a `` training set '' within the context of any number of modern object classification algorithms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our algorithm of choice is a non - parametric bayesian classifier ( nbc ) , based on kernel density estimation ( kde ) .",
    "it is bayesian in that it weights by a `` prior '' .",
    "it is non - parametric in that objects are classified as either `` in '' or `` out '' .",
    "the kde aspect refers to the fact that points are not treated as discrete , but rather are smoothed by some appropriate kernel function ( e.g. , a gaussian ) in building the probability distribution function ( pdf ) that is used to evaluate the classification .",
    "the essence of our algorithm is to define two training sets , one that represents the type of objects that we are trying to find and one that represents everything else .",
    "new objects are classified according to which of the training sets is most consistent with the colors of the new object .",
    "the actual details are more complicated and have largely to do with computing speed while dealing with large data sets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in short ,",
    "the algorithm is designed to only use as much information as is needed to uniquely classify each new object ( i.e. , the code is fast because it performs non - parametric instead of parametric classification )",
    ". some limitations of our algorithm are that we currently do not include error information in our analysis ( cf . , @xcite ) and only perform binary ( quasar or non - quasar ) selection .",
    "while errors are not currently included explicitly , they are included implicitly by virtue of the error distribution inherent to the training sets . in the future we hope to perform simultaneous star - galaxy - quasar classification .",
    "i.e. the code is fast because it uses geometric data structures to eliminate points from consideration when possible while still preserving the exact classification answers ) .",
    "this allows the method to scale to millions of points tractably , unlike methods with similar accuracy such as nonlinear support vector machines , which can not scale beyond tens of thousands of points . because the method is non - parametric , it is free of distributional assumptions and yields state - of - the - art accuracy .",
    "its bayesian use of priors automatically handles the common difficulty of training where one class ( quasars ) has many fewer examples than the other ( non - quasars ) , unlike most common classification methods    our bayesian selection algorithm is guided by four considerations .",
    "first are the so - called `` wedge '' diagrams for mir selection of agns .",
    "these are regions of color space that tend to be occupied by agns .",
    "@xcite select agns using color cuts in non - adjacent bandpasses to isolate agns , specifically @xmath21-[5.8]$ ] and @xmath22-[8.0]$ ] ; we refer to these color cuts as the `` lacy wedge '' .",
    "@xcite instead utilize adjacent bandpasses , specifically @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] and @xmath23-[8.0]$ ] ; we refer to these color cuts as the `` stern wedge '' .",
    "the exact color - cuts that describe these regions have changed slightly over time as more _ spitzer _",
    "data have been obtained .",
    "thus we will refer to them in the abstract sense throughout the paper , but we visually illustrate them in figure  [ fig : iracstargal ] .",
    "the lacy wedge region is given by the dashed lines in the top left - hand panel and the stern wedge region is given by the dashed lines in the bottom left - hand panel .",
    "the second diagnostic considers the mean colors for stars and quasars in the irac photometric system ; table  [ tab : tab1 ] gives both the observed and theoretical ( power - law approximated ) values .",
    "the @xmath21-[8.0]$ ] color is @xmath54 , while for quasars it ranges from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "thus , well - measured point sources can be grouped into stars and quasars in a straightforward manner , based on mir colors alone .",
    "third , we consider the utility of having morphology information in addition to photometry and the effects of over - reliance on morphology as when star - galaxy separation fails to be robust .",
    "figure  [ fig : iracstargal ] shows that agns are readily identified as point sources with red mir colors ( even using only the two shortest irac bandpasses ) .",
    "however , photometric errors complicate clean agn identification at faint limits . using just the lacy wedge as an example",
    ", we demonstrate in figure  [ fig : lacywedgemany ] how using a brighter mir flux limit or morphology information can improve the efficiency of mir color selection . removing faint objects , saturated objects , and/or extended objects",
    "significantly reduces contamination .    finally , we consider the color - redshift distribution for known quasars .",
    "six color combinations are shown in figure  [ fig : czplotnew ] as a function of redshift for the known quasar samples described above and for two template quasar spectra . the stern ( dotted ) and lacy ( dashed ) wedge color cuts ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : iracstargal ] ) are included in order to show their effects on completeness with redshift .",
    "cuts in @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] can introduce incompleteness to @xmath20 quasars .",

    "the core of our quasar training set is the 515 optically - selected , spectroscopically - confirmed quasars that have existing _ spitzer_-irac photometry as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : qsotrain ] ; this set is dominated by the 425 quasars from the sdss - dr5 quasar catalog . due to some photometric errors ( bad deblending , etc . ) objects with @xmath21-[4.5]<-0.7 $ ] or @xmath23-[8.0]<-0.5 $ ] are rejected . as our primary goal is efficient n - dimensional selection of type 1 ( broad - line ) quasars , we have not explicitly included obscured or intrinsically weak agns in the training set ,",
    "although doing so would be a logical next step for future investigation .",
    "since the number of known quasars with optical and mir photometry is relatively small in comparison with the size of the sample that we wish to classify , we further include irac 4-band matches to sdss sources that are highly likely to be quasars . below we describe two such classes of objects that are included .",
    "for these samples to be as clean as possible , we require that the sources satisfy @xmath59 , and @xmath60 to exclude saturated objects and to limit the samples to the approximate 8.0@xmath6 m 95% completeness limit of the swire data .    first , given the power of combining morphology with mir colors shown in figure  [ fig : lacywedgemany ] , we identify point sources with red ( agn - like ) mir colors as quasar candidates that are sufficiently robust to be included in the training set . as sdss star - galaxy separation begins to break down at faint magnitudes ( @xmath61 ; @xcite ) with faint extended sources being more likely to be classified as point - like , clean point source identification should be restricted to @xmath62 ( 0.5 mag brighter than the nominal sdss @xmath63-band flux limit ) .",
    "thus , point sources with @xmath64 are classified as quasars if they have @xmath21-[8.0]>0 $ ] , see table  1 .",
    "however , for the xfls data , the mir photometric errors are large enough that a simple cut in @xmath21-[8.0]$ ] is insufficient to cleanly identify quasars ; for these objects we also require @xmath21-[5.8]>-0.5 $ ] and @xmath22-[8.0]>-0.5 $ ] ( akin to the lacy wedge ) .",
    "finally true point source quasars do not typically have mir colors outside of @xmath65-[8.0]<1.4 $ ] and @xmath21-[4.5]<-0.6 $ ] , so we exclude such objects to further limit any contamination by misclassified galaxies and by normal stars .",
    "second , in addition to the above red mir point sources , we capitalize on the work of @xcite and @xcite by including objects that can be robustly identified as quasar candidates based on their location in the mir wedge diagrams . while selection using these wedges",
    "is relatively clean at bright limits , the colors of quasars may change with flux ( indeed fig .",
    "[ fig : iracstargal ] suggests that at fainter limits the quasar contribution weakens with respect to the galaxy contribution , making the mir colors bluer on average ) , thus additional constraints are needed to exclude contaminants .",
    "in particular , we include in the quasar training set any _ point sources _ that are in any of 1 ) the lacy wedge , 2 ) the stern wedge , or 3 ) a modified stern wedge ( which excludes a region near the galaxy locus , see   [ sec : wedge ] below ) .",
    "we further include _ extended sources _ that lie in _ both _ the lacy wedge and our modified stern wedge .",
    "in addition to relatively robust mir point source candidates , these criteria select point sources near the quasar / galaxy boundary in @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] ( between the original and modified stern wedges ) , but reject extended sources in this same `` buffer zone '' where it may be difficult to distinguish true galactic contaminants from host - dominated quasars . for these two mir - selected training set populations , we have not utilized any optical magnitude or color information since optical quasar selection is known to be incomplete in certain redshift ranges ( e.g. , @xmath66 , @xcite ) , and the inclusion of these mir - identified sources is our attempt to mitigate this effect",
    ". however , roughly half of these objects are uv - excess sources that would be included using optical selection alone .",
    "similar to the @xmath66 redshift incompleteness in the optical , mir - only selection is incomplete in a different redshift range ( @xmath5 ) , thus the inclusion of optical - only selection objects in the training set helps recover such objects in our higher dimensional selection . having a training set comprised of both optical - only ( the above 515 known quasars ) and mir - only identified sources aids in the creation of a photometric quasar sample that is as complete as possible at all redshifts .",
    "while no mir - only or optical - only quasar samples are fully complete at all redshifts , by combining the two and then performing quasar selection simultaneously on both mir and optical colors , we overcome the limitations inherent to each method separately .    due to photometric errors ( bad deblending , etc . ) , a handful of the quasar training set objects are outliers from the quasar color - redshift distribution .",
    "we only retain objects that are in the intersection of the following criteria : @xmath21-[8.0]>-0.5 $ ] , @xmath21-[4.5]>-0.5 $ ] , @xmath22-[5.8]>-0.7 $ ] , and @xmath23-[8.0]>-0.5 $ ] . in summary ,",
    "the final quasar training set is the combination of 1 ) known quasars , 2 ) red mir objects with point - like optical morphologies , 3 ) point / extended sources identified in two distinct mir color wedges , and 4 ) excluding some photometric error induced outliers and some extended sources on the border between known quasars and galaxies .    as was the case for our purely optical selection @xcite ,",
    "a more difficult task is to define the non - quasar training set ( here both stars and normal galaxies ) as we do not have a sufficiently large ( and representative ) sample of spectroscopically confirmed objects .",
    "while there are many thousands of sdss spectra of galaxies and stars , the galaxy sample extends only to @xmath67 and the star spectra cover only specific regions of color parameter space .",
    "furthermore , optical spectra may not reveal the agn nature of a galaxy as well as the mir colors would .",
    "thus , we are essentially left with identifying the leftovers from our quasar training set as the non - quasar training set , with the exception of borderline objects that we exclude from either training set .",
    "objects in the non - quasar training set satisfy the following conditions .",
    "first , they must not be in the quasar training set .",
    "second , they are rejected if they lie in the lacy wedge and also either the original or modified stern wedges .",
    "the remaining objects that meet our magnitude and flux limits constitute the non - quasar training set .    figure  [ fig : iraccolorstrainlib ] shows the mir color distribution of the objects in the quasar and non - quasar training sets .",
    "the sdss colors of the same objects are shown in figure  [ fig : sdsscolorstrainlib ] .",
    "the training set has 53332 objects ; 5627 labeled as quasars and 47705 as non - quasars . for our bayesian classification method",
    ", we need to estimate a `` prior '' that indicates the a priori probability of any given object in our samples not being a quasar .",
    "we adopt the fraction determined from the training sets as a reasonable value , specifically 89% .      in figure",
    "[ fig : wedgecomp ] we compare and contrast the two primary mir color selection techniques in use today ; see also @xcite . by exploring the color space occupied by objects selected by the stern wedge , but",
    "not the lacy wedge , and vice versa , we hope to create a more robust quasar training set from mir colors . examination of figure  [ fig : wedgecomp ] reveals the following    * the stern wedge is relatively clean ( few objects are outside of the lacy wedge ) . *",
    "the lacy wedge is very clean to the 1mjy flux limit for which it was defined but is quite contaminated at fainter mir fluxes ( it contains many objects outside of the stern wedge ) . * the stern wedge s lack of contamination comes largely from its cut on @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] .",
    "although very effective over a wide range of redshifts , this cut makes the stern wedge incomplete to quasars with @xmath68 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : czplotnew ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we note that the stern wedge s blue cut in @xmath23-[8.0]$ ] excludes objects that are in the lacy wedge .",
    "such objects are rejected nominally to exclude high - redshift galaxies ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) ; however , as these objects are found by @xcite to be strong soft x - ray sources , the agn population likely crosses this dividing line .",
    "indeed , during a 2008 june observing run on the mayall 4-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory , we were able to make observations of 9 randomly chosen sources blueward of the stern wedge s @xmath23-[8.0]$ ] cut .",
    "of the six sources redder than @xmath21-[4.5]=-0.1 $ ] , three are clearly quasars ( @xmath69 ) and a 4th may also be a quasar at low signal - to - noise ; their mir colors are shown in figure  [ fig : wedgecomp ] .",
    "these objects are all in the region of strong soft x - ray sources ( and thus likely quasars ) as indicated by @xcite and have two similar features .",
    "all are flagged as color selected quasar candidates @xcite in the sdss database , but were too faint to be targeted for spectroscopy .",
    "they also have very similar appearances in the optical , being extended , but centrally concentrated bluish - white objects . when coupled with mir data , these characteristics may help to identify additional quasars in the sdss database that are nominally outside of the stern wedge , but that may nevertheless be agns .",
    "thus , as mentioned above , we implement a `` modified stern wedge '' that is adjusted from the original stern wedge as follows .",
    "we first make a more conservative cut on the agn / galaxy border in @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] color .",
    "second , we allow objects bluer than @xmath23-[8.0]<-0.07 $ ] if they have @xmath21-[4.5]>-0.0626 $ ] ( the intersection of our modified @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] and the original @xmath23-[8.0]$ ] cuts ) .",
    "this modified stern wedge is defined by the following set of color cuts ( see fig .  [",

    "we are not suggesting that this modified wedge be used in place of the stern wedge for mir agn selection , rather we use it to minimizing contamination from normal galaxies in our training sets , while attempting to maximize completeness to quasars with @xmath5 .",
    "once the training sets are defined , we follow the techniques described in @xcite for utilizing these training sets to select objects from a sample of data",
    ". we shall perform this selection for two sets of color space : 8-d ( mir+optical ) to attempt a more complete type 1 quasar selection than can be accomplished with mir - only or optical - only selection ; and 6-d , anticipating the operation of _ spitzer _ post - cryogen , when only irac channels 1 and 2 will be operational .",
    "we have additionally attempted a 3-d mir - only bayesian selection .",
    "although this approach adds an extra color dimension that is otherwise being wasted by the 2-d mir wedge selection methods , we find that it does not work significantly better ( e.g. , it is still rather incomplete to @xmath20 quasars as is the stern wedge ) and do not discuss it further here .",
    "in addition to a _",
    "prior _ ( as discussed above ) our algorithm also uses a leave - one - out cross - validation process to determine the optimal bandwidths ( kernel smoothing parameter ) for the agn and non - agn samples , respectively .",
    "these bandwidths are essentially the resolution of the pdf , akin to the bin size for a histogram .",
    "see @xcite for details , but , in brief , the algorithm examines a range of bandwidths and chooses the one that maximizes our completeness to known quasars while minimizing contamination .",
    "the adopted training set bandwidths notated as ( star , quasar ) were @xmath71 and @xmath72 magnitudes , for the 8-d and 6-d selection , respectively .",
    "the selection is reasonably robust to small ( @xmath73 mag ) changes from these values .",
    "traditional color - color selection has proven to work fairly well in the mir using the 4-band _ spitzer_-irac data @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite quote better than 80% completeness with less than 20% contamination to @xmath74 . however , mir selection with _",
    "spitzer_-irac is generally done in 2-d color space when 3 unique colors are available .",
    "using instead our bayesian algorithm in 3 dimensions , we hope to improve both the completeness and efficiency of mir agn selection . here",
    "we specifically concentrate on unobscured , type 1 agns ; however , our method also recovers some obscured agns as well . a more explicit attempt to extract type",
    "2 agns is left for future work .",
    "we have applied our bayesian selection algorithm to the mir colors of sample a using the training sets , priors , and bandwidths described above . as with the training sets , sample a",
    "was first restricted to @xmath75 , and @xmath76 to exclude saturated objects and to limit the sample to the approximate 8.0@xmath6 m 95% completeness limit of the swire data . in all , 5123 objects were identified as agn candidates , including one object as conservative only , 800 as liberal only , and 4322 using both the conservative and liberal selections .",
    "the mir and optical color distributions of the objects are shown in figures  [ fig : iraccolorstest4dclass ] and  [ fig : sdsscolorstest4dclass ] , respectively .",
    "we find that the vast majority of the objects are isolated to the stern wedge , even considering our attempts to be more inclusive .",
    "thus , unfortunately , even extending standard 2-d color selection to a 3-d bayesian analysis does not seem to allow robust selection of @xmath20 quasars .",
    "however , we do find a small cluster of objects somewhat bluer than the stern wedge in @xmath77-[8.0])$ ] , specifically near @xmath21-[4.5]=0.2 , [ 5.8]-[8.0]=0.2 $ ] , which are consistent with the soft x - ray sources in @xcite .",
    "essentially all of the 3-d bayesian selected objects lie in the lacy wedge , but only populate a fraction of that parameter space , consistent with our expectation that the lacy wedge should suffer contamination at fluxes fainter than its defining limits .",
    "the upper left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : zhisttrainall ] shows the redshift dependence of the fraction of objects recovered by our 3-d mir - only bayesian color selection algorithm .",
    "overall the completeness to spectroscopically confirmed type 1 quasars is 95.7% .",
    "however , as with the stern wedge , the sample is most incomplete over @xmath20 , with the liberal training set performing somewhat better over @xmath78 , as designed .",
    "quasar selection is essentially an algorithm that identifies outliers from the stellar locus in the optical or the galaxy locus in the mir .",
    "thus , one might expect that combining optical and mir photometry together will yield more robust quasar selection than optical or mir photometry alone as objects only need to be outliers in one dimension .",
    "in particular , our desire is to combine the 5 sdss and all 4 irac bandpasses together to recover the @xmath79 quasars lost by optical selection due to stellar locus contamination and the @xmath20 quasars lost by mir selection due to galaxy locus contamination .",
    "we have applied our bayesian selection method to the 8 unique colors afforded by sdss plus irac photometry in sample b. as with the training sets , we limit sample b to @xmath80 , and @xmath60 , which reduces the sample from 95,181 objects to 52,659 objects . in all , 5468 quasar candidates were found .",
    "the mir and optical color distributions of these 8-d selected objects are shown in figures  [ fig : iraccolorstest79dclass ] and [ fig : sdsscolorstest79dclass ] , respectively .",
    "here we have added theoretical power - law colors to the mir color - color plots , which demonstrates that the most robust objects tend to have power - law colors in the mir ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the primary differences between these and 2-d mir wedge selection are that 541 objects outside of the stern wedge are now selected and the left ( blue ) part of the lacy wedge is more represented . the redshift completeness ( to known type 1 quasars ) is given in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : zhisttrainall ] . as compared to mir - only selection using the stern wedge ( right - hand panel )",
    ", it is clear that that 8-d mir+optical selection performs better over @xmath5 .",
    "overall the completeness to spectroscopically confirmed type 1 quasars is 97.7% .",
    "this high completeness suggests that it should be possible to attempt to classify fainter sources and still maintain a reasonably high completeness  although clearly photometric errors limit how faint the method can be applied .",
    "these results from our 8-d bayesian selection are promising ; however , once _ spitzer _ has exhausted its coolant , it will no longer be able to observe in the two longest irac bands .",
    "thus an interesting question is how well our methods will work when only irac channels 1 and 2 are operational .    as such",
    ", we have also performed a 6-d bayesian selection using the 5 sdss bandpasses and only the 2 shortest wavelength irac bandpasses . instead of using sample a here ( which includes object rejected from sample b due to lack of channel 3/4 detections )",
    ", we instead have only considered the same 52,659 magnitude / flux - limited sources from sample b above , simply ignoring the color information from channels 3/4 .",
    "we have made this choice in order to provide the most direct and unbiased comparison between 8-d and 6-d selection .",
    "however , we emphasize that , similarly limiting sample a to unsaturated sources and the swire 95% completeness limit at 3.6@xmath6 m ( table  [ tab : tab0 ] ) [ allowing non - detections in channels 3/4 ] , we can potentially apply our 6-d algorithm to over 290,000 sources .",
    "overall our 6-d algorithm selects 5222 objects and is not significantly worse than 8-d , with a completeness of 97.1% with respect to the type 1 quasars in the training set .",
    "the completeness as a function of redshift ( red line in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : zhisttrainall ] ) is consistent with that for 8-d selection .",
    "the drop in @xmath81 completeness is not statistically significant given the small number of objects considered . in all , 324 ( 6% ) objects that were selected by the 8-d algorithm are not 6-d candidates .",
    "there are also 78 ( 1% ) 6-d selected sources that are not 8-d candidates .",
    "figures  [ fig : iraccolorstest79dclass ] and [ fig : sdsscolorstest79dclass ] show the locations of objects selected by both the 8-d and 6-d algorithms and also those selected by only one .",
    "table  [ tab : tab2 ] shows a comparison between our bayesian selection methods , the lacy and stern wedges , and a simple @xmath21-[4.5]>-0.1 $ ] color cut .",
    "for bright flux limits ( @xmath82 ) our bayesian method agrees well with the lacy and stern wedges , with the @xmath21-[4.5]>-0.1 $ ] cut being about 50% contaminated . at fainter limits the lacy wedge",
    "is seen to be contaminated by inactive galaxies , the @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] cut somewhat less so .",
    "of 8-d bayesian selected quasars candidates , 99% are within the lacy wedge and 90% are within the stern wedge ; thus we expect the bayesian sample to be quite clean .    in terms of completeness",
    ", figure  [ fig : zhisttrainall ] demonstrates that the lacy wedge and either of our 8-d or 6-d bayesian algorithms are quite complete to type 1 quasars at nearly all redshifts .",
    "the comparison sample is the set of spectroscopically - confirmed type 1 quasars that were used to construct our quasar training set .",
    "thus , figure  [ fig : zhisttrainall ] represents the self - selection completeness . as an additional check",
    ", we find that our algorithm recovers all 51 of the type 1 quasars cataloged by @xcite in the cosmos field ( to @xmath83 and @xmath84jy ) .",
    "the lacy wedge is much more contaminated ( table  [ tab : tab2 ] ) than our bayesian - selected samples .",
    "the stern wedge would appear to be the least contaminated , but is also the least complete , particularly for @xmath20 .",
    "a simple @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] color cut is somewhat more complete than stern wedge selection , but suffers from considerable contamination . while a @xmath21-[8.0]$ ] color cut might be expected to be cleaner than @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] , the presence of pah features at @xmath85 m causes contamination from low - redshift pah - dominated galaxies that overwhelms the loss of stellar contaminants due to the longer baseline .",
    "a particularly interesting question is how well our mir+optical selection performs above optical - only selection algorithm . for this comparison ,",
    "we utilize our optical - only bayesian - selected quasar catalog @xcite , which includes unresolved sdss quasar candidates to the nominal sdss magnitude limit of @xmath83 .",
    "we find that 1702 of 2426 ( 70% ) of our optical+mir selected targets are also selected by the optical - only algorithm ( for @xmath83 point sources ) .",
    "however , our mir+optical selection benefits by adding 2117 extended sources and 1003 points sources with @xmath86 ( i.e. , nominally fainter than the sdss magnitude limit ) .",
    "thus , using the same sdss dataset as a basis , our mir+optical selection improves quasar selection by a factor of 3.25 ( 5546/1702 ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider the future of mir - based selection of quasars in general , even without the benefit of our bayesian selection method . indeed , while the wedge selection methods rely on irac channels 3 and 4 , it is actually channels 1 and 2 that are most needed  in terms of separating agns from stars and normal galaxies .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : iracstargal ] , in the absence of accurate morphological classification , quasars selected with a @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] cut will have less contamination from galaxies than a @xmath21-[8.0]$ ] cut , yet be similarly effective in removing stars . using a @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] color cut alone , we find that for @xmath21-[4.5]>0.1 $ ] , 91% of known quasars are recovered .",
    "relaxing the cut to @xmath21-[4.5]>-0.1 $ ] recovers 98% of quasars , although the missing objects are predominantly high-@xmath16 .",
    "however , we must also consider the level of contamination .",
    "figure  [ fig : s34compeff ] shows the tradeoff between ( type 1 ) completeness and contamination . here we have made the simplifying assumption that any object lying outside _ either _ the lacy and stern wedges are not quasars and that objects lying _ inside both _ the lacy and stern wedges are quasars . for @xmath21-[4.5]>-0.1 $ ]",
    "the contamination fraction is nearly 60% , though we caution that this number depends significantly on the flux limit .",
    "more importantly , if we desire to recover all of the high-@xmath16 quasars , we must instead use @xmath21-[4.5]>-0.4 $ ] , which has over 85% contamination .",
    "on the other hand , our 6-d bayesian selection ( which also uses only channels 1 and 2 ) is 97.1% complete to known type 1 quasars ( including high-@xmath16 ) , with only 10% contamination , using the same criteria .",
    "our catalog is presented in tables  [ tab : cat ] and [ tab : tab3 ] , where table  [ tab : cat ] describes the columns in table  [ tab : tab3 ] . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also tabulate the 593 objects that were not selected by our bayesian algorithms but that otherwise meet our flux / magnitude criteria and are in _ both _ the lacy and stern wedges ; these objects are given in table  [ tab : tab4 ] .",
    "the numbering of objects is common to tables  [ tab : tab3 ] and [ tab : tab4 ] and are sorted by right ascension .",
    "the first 25 columns in the data tables merely repeat the publicly available optical and mir information on these sources , see @xcite and the references above for more information .",
    "columns 2630 deal with object selection as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : bayes ] .",
    "columns 3138 give photometric redshift information as discussed in the next section .",
    "columns 39 - 41 provide information on previous identification of these objects , whether photometric @xcite , or spectroscopic ( dr5x , @xcite ; dr6x , @xcite ; t07x , @xcite ; p06x ; @xcite ) . for the spectroscopic identifications we have simply repeated the classifications from the indicated references .",
    "in all there are 5546 objects cataloged in table  [ tab : cat ] .",
    "note that this number is similar to the number of objects in our quasar training set .",
    "this similarity is a result of our using the same flux limit for both our training and test sets , while we could have performed 6-d selection to much fainter limits ( nearly 6@xmath87 as many objects ) .",
    "as we consider our work here to be a `` proof - of - concept '' , we save fainter 6-d quasar selection as an exercise for the future after the current catalog has been more fully validated with spectroscopic observations .",
    "thus our procedure has essentially thrown out some wedge - selected quasar candidates and has included some objects outside of the quasar color wedges in the mir . that this is a worthwhile process",
    "can be seen by noting that quasars make up 92% of the known objects in among our bayesian selected targets ( table  [ tab : tab3 ] ) , while the fraction of quasars among our rejected targets ( table  [ tab : tab4 ] ) is only 29% .",
    "in addition , our bayesian algorithm was shown to be more robust than mir - only color section over @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zhisttrainall ] ) , and is less contaminated at fainter flux limits ( table  [ tab : tab2 ] ) .",
    "these properties will be particularly beneficial to the deeper census that can be performed with objects detected in only the 2 bluest irac bandpasses .      while the errors on the irac flux densities ( @xmath88% for irac [ but see @xcite ] vs.  @xmath89% for sdss ) are generally too large to permit accurate mir - only photometric redshift estimation , the combination of sdss and irac photometry allows for considerable leverage in estimating redshifts of agns . we have updated the algorithm described by @xcite and @xcite to operate on any number of color dimensions . in essence , quasar photometric redshift estimation relies on the small , but distinct , color changes produced as broad emission lines move through photometric bandpasses . at @xmath90 , lyman-@xmath91 forest absorption mimics the balmer break that is so useful in reducing galaxy photometric redshift estimates to the 2% level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , quasar emission lines are generally strong enough that they also produce measurable features in the color - redshift relations that can be used to estimate photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath16 s ) .",
    "the mean sdss colors as a function of redshift were shown most recently by @xcite , while the redshift dependence of irac colors for sdss quasars was given by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) ; see also figure  [ fig : czplotnew ]",
    ".    using the irac - detected , spectroscopically - confirmed quasars noted above , we have updated the quasar color - redshift relations and computed the photometric redshifts for all of our quasar candidates . in addition , table  [ tab : cat ] provides not only the most likely photometric redshifts , but also a range and the probability that the actual redshift is within that range .",
    "we compute photometric redshifts both using both 8 colors and 6 colors ( dropping the 2 reddest irac bandpasses to simulate the _ spitzer _ warm mission data ) . in the left - hand panel of figure",
    "[ fig : zzplot ] , we show both the 8-d and 6-d photometric redshifts versus spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the 6-color photo - z s are not significantly worse than the 8-color photo - z s .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising given that most of the information that comes from adding the irac bandpasses is provided by the @xmath57 $ ] color which , due to the 1 micron inflection , spans an impressive 2 magnitudes over @xmath92 ( see the bottom right - hand panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : czplotnew ] ) and serves to break most of the redshift degeneracies seen when computing photometric redshifts from sdss photometry alone . within @xmath93 in redshift , we find that both the 8-color and 6-color photo - z s are accurate 93.6% of the time .",
    "in addition , the majority of the photo - z s are considerably more accurate than @xmath94 ; 8284% are accurate to @xmath95 in redshift .",
    "this accuracy is illustrated in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : zzplot ] , where we show a histogram of the fractional redshift errors .",
    "most of the outliers are fainter objects with @xmath96 , but even for those the fraction of 6-color photoz s accurate to @xmath94 is 92% .    in principle",
    ", any deep optical imaging data can be used to determine photometric redshifts , but in practice the sdss filter set is nearly ideal for photometric redshifts of quasars due to the more `` top - hat '' nature of the sdss filters than the traditional johnson - morgan / kron - cousins filters .",
    "we emphasize that our goal here is primarily to find type 1 quasars for which our photometric redshift algorithm should work quite well .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which also enables simultaneous photometric redshift estimation for inactive galaxies and type 2 quasars .      with the aid of photometric redshifts",

    "two extreme cuts on our catalog are shown to give the reader the range of possible values as objects get fainter and classification ( and redshift estimation ) become less robust .",
    "the number counts are just slightly above those of the sdss spectroscopic sample for relatively bright @xmath97 sources , which is consistent with the fact that fully or partially obscured quasars in our sample have not been corrected for internal extinction ( and thus will be shifted to fainter bins ) .",
    "as such , even in the presence of a significant population of obscured sources , we would not expect the number counts as a function of observed magnitude to be much higher than for the sdss spectroscopic sample in this range .",
    "for @xmath98 quasars , we see a marked increase in our sample as compared to the sdss spectroscopic sample .",
    "this is likely a combination of the inclusion of obscured quasars that are intrinsically brighter and also due to dust reddened quasars having a greater tendency to ( incorrectly ) have higher photometric redshifts ( since high-@xmath16 quasars have redder colors at short wavelengths ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : zmplot ] shows the distribution of our objects in the absolute magnitude vs.  redshift plane , and demonstrates how this sample can be used to help break luminosity - redshift degeneracies inherent to any flux - limited survey .",

    "note that our @xmath84jy restriction corresponds roughly to 1520@xmath101jy at 3.6@xmath6 m , which is about a factor of 3 shallower than ( 5-@xmath102 ) swire - depth ( 120s ) irac data , thus there is room for further improvements in dynamic range .",
    "similarly , the dashed line shows the improvement that can be expected from using the sdss southern equatorial stripe ( `` stripe 82 '' ) , which has up to 100 epochs of sdss imaging data , yielding a co - added flux limit of @xmath103 @xcite . for luminous sources ( @xmath104 ) the central engine dominates over the host galaxy , but for less luminous sources ( with @xmath105 ) we will have to account for a more significant host galaxy contribution .",
    "the need for more dynamic range in luminosity is illustrated by the dotted black line which traces the `` break '' luminosity in the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) using the multi - wavelength bolometric determination of @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the ability to determine the luminosity dependence of quasars clustering ( particularly at @xmath106 ) , and the slope evolution of the faint end of the quasar luminosity function are among the most important near - future constraints on feedback models of galaxy evolution .",
    "our selection algorithm will help to enable the creation of a quasar sample that can be used the address these issues .",
    "note that , while morphology was used in the creation of the training sets , no optical morphology information is used in the actual bayesian selection . thus we expect that our selection includes some type 2 quasars in addition to the type 1 quasars .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that type 2 quasars have similar colors in the mir as type 1 quasars .",
    "this is true for redshifts low enough ( @xmath107 ) that the irac bands probe thermal emission of circumnuclear dust . at higher redshifts , as rest - frame optical and nir emission moves into the irac passbands , mir colors of type 2",
    "quasars deviate significantly from those of type 1 quasars ; our procedure is not expected to be sensitive to such objects .    as @xcite have shown , type 1 and type 2 quasars are relatively well separated in optical - to - mir flux ratio ; we examine this distribution for our sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : hickoxall ] shows the @xmath108 $ ] vs.  @xmath22 $ ] color - mag distribution of our bayesian - selected quasar candidates with known type 1 ( green ) and type 2 ( gray ) quasars . while @xcite use luminosity in their plots",
    ", our photometric redshifts will be in error for type 2 quasars , so we have made the plot in flux units .",
    "this choice has no effect on the vertical axis which is used by @xcite to separate type 1 and type 2 quasars ( modulo the change in units used herein ) , but it does cause a different distribution along the horizontal axis . point sources ( blue ) and extended sources ( red ) have well - separated mean values that are bifurcated along @xmath108 $ ] , similar to the type 1/2 dividing line advocated by @xcite .",
    "this comparison suggests that our sample contains a significant number of type 2 quasars  despite the fact that we have only attempted type 1 selection ( _ and have required matching to the relatively shallow single - epoch sdss photometric catalog _ ) .",
    "while our sample is certainly not complete to type 2 quasars , we note that type 2 quasars are more likely to have extended morphologies and that figure  [ fig : hickoxall ] shows a `` valley '' between point ( peak @xmath108\\sim2 $ ] ) and extended ( peak @xmath108\\sim3 $ ] ) morphology quasar candidates at a color of @xmath108\\sim2.5 $ ] . as such , the most logical place to look for type 2 quasars among our quasars candidates would be those extended sources with @xmath108>2.5 $ ] of which there are 1252 in all .",

    "comparing to the type 2 quasars cataloged by @xcite in the cosmos field , our algorithm recovers 20 of 66 ( 30% ) with @xmath83 and @xmath109jy .",
    "however , this dividing line in @xmath108 $ ] is not absolute and the optical magnitude and redshift play a significant role in the location of objects in this diagram .",
    "nevertheless , it seems likely that @xmath108 $ ] can be used as a crude diagnostic of type 1 vs.  type 2 agns as suggested by @xcite . on the other hand , point sources with @xmath108\\le2.5",
    "$ ] are quite likely to be type 1 quasars and there are 2536 such objects in our catalog .",
    "[ nz : for type 2 quasars , because of the requirement for the point - like morphology in the optical , there might be a bias toward qso2 with high ir / optical ratios ( because those that live in luminous galaxies or have significant extended nl emission will be more likely to be classified as extended ) . ]",
    "[ ml : include palomar spectroscopy ?",
    "two type 2 candidates were confirmed ( both high-@xmath16 ) , one type 2 has @xmath108=1.25 $ ] and one reddened type 1 candidate was confirmed as such but has @xmath108=3.6 $ ] . ]    in addition to quasars whose central engines are fully obscured in the optical , there also exist quasars that are simply heavily reddened , but still exhibit broad - line emission features that are characteristic of type 1 quasars .",
    "predictions of the size of this population range from @xmath110% @xcite to @xmath111% or more ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most recently @xcite have used ukidss data to argue that the fraction of type 1 quasars missing from @xmath63-band selected surveys ( i.e. , sdss ) is @xmath730% .",
    "recent work suggests that some of this dust reddening may come from the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rather than the putative dusty torus .",
    "thus a complete census is needed to fully understand the demographics of black hole fueling ( and how it affects galaxy evolution ) , and these quasars represent a important , but under - studied population . as with type 2 quasars , our emphasis on unobscured type 1",
    "quasars should allow for more complete selection of quasars that have been extincted or reddened out of purely optically selected samples .",
    "indeed , we are able to recover 6 of the 7 reddened type 1 quasars in the xfls area cataloged by @xcite .",
    "the above plots / diagnostics are for the sample of objects matched to sdss photometry . however , as this selection does not actually make use of any optical information , and the mir sample is deeper than the optical for a typical type 1 quasar sed , we also consider the full irac 4-band sample .",
    "figure  99 shows the same for all 4-band irac detections in the xfls , swire , and cosmos data sets to a flux limit of @xmath112 .",
    "no matching to sdss was done in order to probe as faint as possible  at the expense of the loss of morphology information .",
    "table  99 is similar to table  [ tab : tab2 ] , but for the deeper 4-band irac sample without sdss matching . again",
    "the lacy and @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] cuts are contaminated at the faint end . of the 16,254 quasar candidates selected by our bayesian method ,",
    "16175 , 13996 , and 16214 are selected by the lacy , stern , and @xmath21-[4.5]$ ] cut , respectively .",
    "thus , again , we expect the bayesian sample to be relatively clean .",
    "in this paper we present a method to select type 1 quasars from a combination of optical and mir photometric data .",
    "the method is based on bayesian analysis techniques in multi - dimensional mir+optical color space .",
    "we demonstrate that our algorithm presents a significant improvement over mir - only and optical - only selection procedures .",
    "both the completeness of selection ( i.e. , the percentage of true quasars recovered by the method ) and the robustness of selection ( i.e. , the percentage of objects recovered that are quasars rather than contaminants ) are increased . in all , we catalog 5546 quasar candidates detected in all four bands of irac in @xmath113 deg@xmath3 ( @xmath114 deg@xmath115 ) , yielding a factor of @xmath116 increase in density compared to that of sdss spectroscopic quasar catalog . relaxing our requirement for detections in irac channels 3 and 4 would increase the quasar density by more than a factor of 5 ( @xmath117deg@xmath115 ) .",
    "comparison with existing samples shows that the catalog is more than 95% complete to known type 1 quasars at all redshifts . by combining the 5 sdss and the 4 irac bandpasses",
    ", we recover the @xmath79 quasars lost by optical selection due to contamination by stars and the @xmath20 quasars lost by the mir selection due to contamination by star - forming galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we find that combining optical and mir data allows selection of quasar candidates to much fainter fluxes than those afforded by the mir cuts currently in use in the literature . at the same time , working in the optical+mir color - color space greatly helps with rejecting contaminants ( stars and inactive galaxies ) in an efficient manner .",
    "inclusion of mir data significantly improves photometric redshift estimation for type 1 quasars .",
    "the fraction of quasars with redshifts within 0.3 of the true values increases from @xmath118 for the optical - only photo-@xmath16 to @xmath119% for optical+mir photo-@xmath16 .",
    "much of this improvement is due to a rapid change of @xmath57 $ ] color of quasars as a function of redshift at @xmath107 .",
    "we demonstrate that removing the two longest wavelength irac channels has little detrimental effect on the selection procedure and on the quality of photometric redshift estimates .",
    "therefore our method can be successfully used on data collected during the warm extension of the _ spitzer _ mission .",
    "a wide - area sample of overlapping deep optical and mir data would make groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of quasar feedback and the evolution of galaxies by breaking the redshift - luminosity degeneracy inherent to current quasars surveys ( fig  [ fig : zmplot ] ) .    although the algorithm was primarily designed to be complete for selection of type 1 quasars",
    ", it is also sensitive to at least some type 2 quasars .",
    "this is possible because mir colors of low - redshift quasars are dominated by the thermal emission of circumnuclear dust and are therefore similar for type 1 and type 2 objects .",
    "we estimate that as many as 1200 of our quasar candidates are type 2 quasars .",
    "although our procedure is not complete for type 2 quasars , our work lays the foundation for identification of type 2 quasars using modern statistical methods .    while mir selection of agns has enabled great progress in agn identification in recent years ( particularly with regard to obscured quasars ) , we have shown that using modern bayesian selection techniques on the combination of optical and mir data allows for more complete and more efficient quasar selection to even deeper limits than is afforded by the use of mir color cuts alone .",
    "although we concentrate on type 1 ( unobscured ) quasars , our method is also sensitive to type 2 ( obscured ) quasars and lays the groundwork for improvement in future identification of type 2 quasars using modern statistical methods .",
    "in addition to quasar selection , we showed that coupling optical and mir data together allow for significant improvements in estimating redshifts for type 1 quasars from photometry alone . with sufficient multiwavelength coverage over large areas , in the near future it should be possible to extend this accuracy to type 2 quasars .    in all we catalog 5546 optical+mir quasar candidates in just @xmath2 deg@xmath3 ( > 200 deg@xmath115 ) , yielding a far greater density than from sdss data alone ( @xmath88 deg@xmath3 ) , despite using only the single - epoch sdss imaging data .",
    "comparison with existing samples shows that the catalog is no less than 90% complete to type 1 quasars .",
    "in addition , as many as 1200 of our quasar candidates are expected to be type 2 quasars .",
    "inclusion of mir photometry significantly improves photometric redshift estimation for broad - line quasars from @xmath120% to nearly @xmath121% .    indeed , the combination of optical and mir data is sufficiently powerful that quasar selection and photometric redshift identification suffer little from the loss of _",
    "spitzer s _ longest wavelength channels .",
    "we note that the swire depth imaging is nearly perfectly matched to the magnitude limits of sdss stripe 82 ( which covers @xmath122deg@xmath3 over @xmath123 and @xmath124 for quasars spectral energy distributions .",
    "in addition to a significant amount of multi - wavelength data in the uv , nir , mm , and radio bandpasses , the multiplexed nature of the stripe 82 data allows uniquely powerful investigations leveraged from variability , proper motion , and astrometric redshifts . thus we look forward to the contributions that an irac - mapped region of sdss stripe 82 would make to our understanding of quasar feedback and the evolution of galaxies by breaking the redshift - luminosity degeneracy inherent to current quasars surveys .",
    "figure  [ fig : limitssedwarm ] compares the flux limits of a 120s depth swire - like _ spitzer _ warm mission @xmath125 to the flux limits of the ukidss survey , the sdss main survey , sdss stripe 82 , and galex .",
    "for such a depth in the mir , sdss stripe 82 is more than deep enough to recover type 1 quasars at all redshifts , including quasars reddened by as much at @xmath126 at @xmath127 ( and even more reddened at higher redshift ) and will detect type 2 quasars to somewhat shallower mir limits . for those objects with depth comparable to the sdss main survey in the optical , ukidss and _ galex",

    "<S> we explore the multidimensional , multiwavelength selection of quasars from mid - ir ( mir ) plus optical data , specifically from _ spitzer_-irac and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally quasar selection relies on cuts in 2-d color space despite the fact that most modern surveys ( optical and infrared ) are done in more than 3 bandpasses . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we apply modern statistical techniques to combined _ spitzer _ mir and sdss optical data , allowing up to 8-d color selection of quasars . using a bayesian selection method , we catalog 5546 quasar candidates to an @xmath0 m depth of @xmath1jy over an area of @xmath2 deg@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> roughly 70% of these candidates are not identified by applying the same bayesian algorithm to 4-color sdss optical data alone . </S>",
    "<S> the 8-d optical+mir selection on this data set recovers @xmath4% of known type 1 quasars in this area and greatly improves the effectiveness of identifying @xmath5 quasars which are challenging to identify ( without considerable contamination ) using mir data alone . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , even using only the two shortest wavelength irac bandpasses ( 3.6 and 4.5@xmath6 m ) , it is possible to use our bayesian techniques to select quasars with 97% completeness and as little as 10% contamination ( as compared to @xmath760% contamination using colors cuts alone ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compute photometric redshifts for our sample ; comparison with known objects suggests a photometric redshift accuracy of 93.6% ( @xmath8 ) , remaining roughly constant when the two reddest mir bands are excluded . despite the fact that our methods are designed to find type 1 ( unobscured ) quasars , as many as 1200 of the objects are type 2 ( obscured ) quasar candidates . </S>",
    "<S> coupling deep optical imaging data , with deep mid - ir data could enable selection of quasars in significant numbers past the peak of the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) to at least @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> such a sample would constrain the shape of the qlf both above and below the break luminosity ( @xmath10 ) and enable quasar clustering studies over the largest range of redshift and luminosity to date , yielding significant gains in our understanding of the physics of quasars and their contribution to galaxy evolution . </S>"
