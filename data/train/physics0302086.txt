    "complex analysis is one of the most beautiful subjects in mathematics , and , in spite of involving imaginary numbers , it has remarkable relevance for ` real ' applications .",
    "one of its most useful techniques is conformal mapping , which transforms planar domains according to analytic functions , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 .",
    "geometrically , such mappings induce upon the plane a uniform , local stretching by @xmath2 and a rotation by @xmath3 .",
    "this ` ampli - twist ' interpretation of the derivative implies conformality , the preservation of angles between intersecting curves ( needham 1997 ) .    the classical application of conformal mapping is to solve laplace s equation , @xmath4 i.e. to determine harmonic functions , in complicated planar domains by mapping to simple domains .",

    "important analytical solutions were thus obtained for electric fields in capacitors , thermal fluxes around pipes , inviscid flows past airfoils , etc .",
    "( needham 1997 ; churchill & brown 1990 ; batchelor 1967 ) . today , conformal mapping is still used extensively in numerical methods ( trefethen 1986 ) .    currently in physics , a veritable renaissance in conformal mapping is centering around ` laplacian - growth ' phenomena , in which the motion of a free boundary is determined by the normal derivative of a harmonic function .",
    "continuous problems of this type include viscous fingering , where the pressure is harmonic ( saffman & taylor 1958 ; bensimon _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ; saffman 1986 ) , and solidification from a supercooled melt , where the temperature is harmonic in some approximations ( kessler _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ; cummings _ et al .",
    "such problems can be elegantly formulated in terms of time - dependent conformal maps , which generate the moving boundary from its initial position .",
    "this idea was first developed by polubarinova - kochina ( 1945a ; 1945b ) and galin ( 1945 ) with recent interest stimulated by shraiman & bensimon ( 1984 ) focusing on finite - time singularities and pattern selection ( howison 1986 ; tanveer 1987 ; dai _ et al .",

    "one of our motivations here is to extend such powerful analytical methods to fractal growth phenomena limited by _ non - laplacian _ transport processes .",
    "compared to the vast literature on conformal mapping for laplace s equation , the technique has scarcely been applied to any other equations .",
    "the difficulty with non - harmonic functions is illustrated by helmholtz s equation , @xmath5 which arises in transient diffusion and electromagnetic radiation ( morse & feshbach 1953 ) .",
    "after conformal mapping , @xmath0 , it acquires a cumbersome , non - constant coefficient ( the jacobian of the map ) , @xmath6 similarly , the bi - harmonic equation , @xmath7 which arises in two - dimensional viscous flows ( batchelor 1967 ) and elasticity ( muskhelishvili 1953 ) , transforms with an extra laplacian term ( see below ) , @xmath8 in this special case , conformal mapping is commonly used ( e.g. chan _ et al .",

    "2002b ) because solutions can be expressed in terms of analytic functions in goursat form ( muskhelishvili 1953 ) .",
    "nevertheless , given the singular ease of applying conformal mapping to laplace s equation , it is natural to ask whether any other equations share its conformal invariance , which is widely believed to be unique .",
    "in this paper , we show that certain _",
    "systems _ of nonlinear equations , with non - harmonic solutions , are also conformally invariant . in section  [ sec : math ] , we give a simple proof of this fact and some of its consequences . in section",
    "[ sec : phys ] , we discuss applications to nonlinear diffusion phenomena and show that single conformally invariant equations can always be reduced to laplace s equation ( which is not true for coupled systems ) . in section  [ sec : ad ] , we apply conformal mapping to nonlinear advection - diffusion in a potential flow , which is equivalent to streamline coordinates in a special case ( boussinesq 1905 ) . in section  [ sec : elec ]",
    ", we apply conformal mapping to nonlinear electrochemical transport , apparently for the first time . in section  [ sec : concl ] , we summarize the main results .",
    "applications to non - laplacian fractal growth are a common theme throughout the paper .",
    "( see sections 2 , 4 , and 6 . )",
    "the standard application of conformal mapping is based on two facts :    1 .",
    "any harmonic function , @xmath9 , in a singly connected planar domain , @xmath10 , is the real part of a analytic function , @xmath11 , the ` complex potential ' ( which is unique up to an additive constant ) : @xmath12 .",
    "since analyticity is preserved under composition , harmonicity is preserved under conformal mapping , so @xmath13 is harmonic in @xmath14 .",
    "presented like this , it seems that conformal mapping is closely tied to harmonic functions , but fact 2 simply expresses the conformal invariance of laplace s equation : a solution , @xmath15 , is the same in any mapped coordinate system , @xmath16 .",
    "fact 1 , a special relation between harmonic functions and analytic functions , is not really needed .",
    "if another equation were also conformally invariant , then its non - harmonic solutions , @xmath17 , would be preserved under conformal mapping in the same way , @xmath18 .",

    "we thus express the gradient vector operator in the plane as a complex scalar operator is more common in the mathematical literature , we prefer @xmath22 for applications in transport theory because gradients play a central role . ] , @xmath23 which has the essential property that @xmath24 if and only if @xmath25 is analytic , in which case , @xmath26 ( needham 1997 ) . since @xmath27",
    ", the laplacian operator can be expressed as , @xmath28 ( if mixed partial derivatives can be taken in any order ) .",
    "similarly , the ` advection operator ' , which acts on _ two _ real functions @xmath9 and @xmath29 , takes the form , @xmath30 .    under a conformal mapping of the plane , @xmath31 , the gradient transforms as , @xmath32 .",
    "this basic fact , combining the ampli - twist property and the chain rule , makes it easy to transform differential operators ( needham 1997 ) .",
    "the laplacian transforms as , @xmath33 where @xmath34 because @xmath35 is also analytic .",
    "this immediately implies the conformal invariance of laplace s equation ( [ eq : laplace ] ) , and the non - invariance of helmholtz s equation ( [ eq : helm ] ) .",
    "the transformation of the bi - harmonic equation ( [ eq : bi ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bitrans ] ) is also easily derived with the help of needham s identity , @xmath36 , applied to @xmath35 .",
    "everything in this paper follows from the simple observation that the advection operator transforms just like the laplacian , @xmath37 each operator involves a ` dot product of two gradients ' , so the same jacobian factor , @xmath38 , appears in both cases .",
    "the transformation laws , eq .  ( [ eq : lapl ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : conv ] ) , are surely well known , but it seems that some general implications have been overlooked , or at least not fully exploited in physical applications .      the identities  ( [ eq : lapl ] ) and ( [ eq : conv ] ) imply the conformal invariance of any system of equations of the general form , @xmath39 where the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 may be nonlinear functions of the unknowns , @xmath42 , but not of the independent variables or any derivatives of the unknowns .",
    "thus we arrive at our main result :    _ ( conformal mapping theorem . )",
    "_ let @xmath43 satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : geneq ] ) in a domain @xmath10 of the complex plane , and let @xmath31 be a conformal mapping from @xmath19 to @xmath10",
    ". then @xmath44 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : geneq ] ) in @xmath19 .",
    "whenever the system ( [ eq : geneq ] ) can be solved analytically in some simple domain , the theorem produces a family of exact solutions for all topologically equivalent domains . otherwise , it allows a convenient numerical solution to be mapped to more complicated domains of interest",
    "this is an enormous simplification for free boundary problems , where the solution in an evolving domain can be obtained by time - dependent conformal mapping to a single , static domain .",
    "conformal mapping is most useful when the boundary conditions are also invariant .",
    "dirichlet ( @xmath45 constant ) or neumann ( @xmath46 ) conditions are typically assumed , but here we consider the straight - forward generalizations , @xmath47 respectively , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are nonlinear functions of the unknowns , @xmath50 is a constant , and @xmath51 is the unit normal .",
    "the conformal invariance of the former is obvious , so we briefly consider the latter .",
    "it is convenient to locally transform a vector field , @xmath52 , along a given contour as , @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the projections onto the unit tangent , @xmath56 , and the ( right - handed ) unit normal , @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "since the tangent transforms as , @xmath58 , and the gradient as , @xmath59 , we find , @xmath60 . the invariance of eq .",
    "( [ eq : genbc ] ) follows after taking the imaginary part on the boundary contour .",
    "generalizing @xmath61 for laplacian problems , we define a ` flux density ' for solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : geneq ] ) to be any quasi - linear combination of gradients , @xmath62 where @xmath63 are nonlinear functions .",
    "the transformation rules above for the gradient apply more generally to any flux density , @xmath64 and @xmath65 satisfy equations of the form ( [ eq : geneq ] ) with corresponding flux densities , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , of the form ( [ eq : fluxdef ] ) . if @xmath68 on a contour @xmath69 for some complex constant @xmath70 , then @xmath71 on the image , @xmath72 , after a conformal mapping , @xmath0 .",
    "an important corollary pertains to ` similarity solutions ' of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : geneq ] ) and ( [ eq : genbc ] ) in which certain variables @xmath73 involved in a flux density depend on only one cartesian coordinate , say @xmath74 , after conformal mapping : @xmath75 .",
    "( our examples below are mostly of this type . )",
    "such special solutions share the same flux lines ( level curves of @xmath76 ) and iso - potentials ( level curves of @xmath77 ) in any geometry attainable by conformal mapping .",
    "they also share the same _ spatial distribution _ of flux density on an iso - potential , although the _ magnitudes _ generally differ .",
    "an important physical quantity is the total normal flux through a contour , often called the ` nusselt number ' , @xmath78 .",
    "for any contour , @xmath79 , we define a complex total flux , @xmath80 , [ eq : i ] such that @xmath81 is the integrated tangential flux and @xmath82 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftrans ] ) and @xmath83 , we conclude , @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , flux integrals can be calculated in any convenient geometry .",
    "this basic fact has many applications .",
    "for example , if @xmath85 is constant on a contour @xmath72 , then for any conformal mapping , we have , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is simply the length of @xmath88 .",
    "for fluxes driven by gradients of harmonic functions , this is the basis for the method of iterated conformal maps for dla , in which the ` harmonic measure ' for random growth events on a fractal cluster is replaced by a uniform probability measure on the unit circle ( hastings & levitov 1998 ) .",
    "more generally , a non - harmonic probability measure for fractal growth can be constructed for any flux law of the form ( [ eq : fluxdef ] ) for fields satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : geneq ] ) . according to the results above ,",
    "the growth probability is simply proportional to the normal flux density on the unit circle for the same transport problem after conformal mapping to the exterior of the unit disk .",
    "a nontrivial example is given below in section  [ sec : ad](c ) .",
    "this allows the hastings - levitov method to be extended to a broad class of non - laplacian fractal - growth processes ( bazant , choi & davidovitch 2003 ) .",
    "the conformal mapping theorem is even more general than it might appear from our proof : the domain , @xmath19 , may be contained in any two - dimensional manifold .",
    "this becomes clear from the recent work of entov and etingof ( 1991 ; 1997 ) , who solved viscous fingering problems on various curved surfaces by conformal mapping to the complex plane , e.g. via stereographic projection from the riemann sphere .",
    "they exploited the fact that laplace s equation is invariant under any conformal mapping , @xmath89 , from the plane to a curved surface because the laplacian transforms as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the jacobian .",
    "the system ( [ eq : geneq ] ) shares this general conformal invariance because the advection operator transforms in the same way , @xmath92 .",
    "the application of these ideas to non - laplacian transport - limited growth phenomena on curved surfaces is work in progress with j. choi and d. crowdy ; here we focus on conformal mappings in the plane , described by analytic functions .",
    "conformally invariant boundary - value problems of the form ( [ eq : geneq ] ) and ( [ eq : genbc ] ) commonly arise in physics from steady conservation laws , @xmath93 for gradient - driven flux densities , eq .",

    "examples include s advection - diffusion in potential flows and bulk electrochemical transport .    before discussing these cases of coupled dependent variables , it is instructive to consider nonlinear diffusion in only one variable .",

    "the general solutions to equation  ( [ eq : ivan ] ) are simply nonlinear functions of harmonic functions , so , in the case of one variable , our theorems can be easily understood in terms of standard conformal mapping . for two or more coupled variables ,",
