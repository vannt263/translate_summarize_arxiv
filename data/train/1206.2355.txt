    "minor mergers are a common phenomenon in the growth of galaxy groups and clusters and leave characteristic observable features in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the passage of a less massive subcluster through the main cluster offsets the central gas peak from the central potential well .",
    "subsequently , the offset icm falls back towards the potential minimum and thus oscillates  or sloshes  inside the cluster center ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transfer of angular momentum in off - center mergers gives the sloshing gas a spiral - like appearance .",
    "the sloshing forms cold fronts ( cfs ) in the gas , i.e.  arc - shaped discontinuities in density , temperature , metallicity and thus x - ray brightness wrapped around cluster cores .",
    "similar features can occur in equal - mass mergers if the merger partners pass each other at a sufficiently large distance such that their cores are only disturbed but not destroyed . sloshing cfs",
    "are commonly seen in clusters ( @xcite ) and have been observed in detail in several clusters and groups ( see also review by @xcite ) , e.g.  abell 1795 ( @xcite ) , abell 2142 ( @xcite ) , abell 496 ( @xcite ) , ngc 5098 ( @xcite ) , ngc 5044 ( @xcite ) , ngc 6868 ( @xcite ) , ngc 5846 ( @xcite ) , the perseus cluster ( @xcite ) , and the virgo cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite performed hydrodynamic merger simulations specifically tailored to the virgo cluster and abell 496 . by varying the merger geometry and mass ratio , the observed positions of the cfs and contrasts across them can be reproduced quantitatively and thus the recent merger history be constrained .    sloshing cfs",
    "have generally been considered as smooth arcs ( e.g.  in virgo , abell 2142 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to predictions from high - resolution purely hydrodynamic simulations , where the cfs are distorted by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ( khis ) due to shear flows along the front ( @xcite ) .",
    "both viscosity and magnetic fields have been invoked to explain the absence of khis in observed cfs ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , some cfs do have significant substructure .",
    "for example , the multiple sloshing cfs in a496 clearly display a remarkable boxy morphology which had been unexplained until recently .",
    "our high - resolution non - viscous simulations ( @xcite ) reproduce these boxy features and demonstrate that they arise due to khis at the cfs plus their interplay with projection .",
    "also the sloshing cf in rx j1720 ( @xcite ) is somewhat boxy - shaped , and the cfs in ngc  7618 and ugc  12491 presented in this paper are clearly distorted .",
    "ngc  7618 and ugc  12491 are the central galaxies of two nearby , roughly equal mass galaxy groups ( @xmath2=0.017309 , @xmath3=74.1 mpc , 1@xmath4 @xmath5 ) .",
    "an asca / gis image of the pair ( @xcite ) shows extended x - ray emission centered on each of the dominant early - type galaxies .",
    "a short chandra observation of ngc  7618 ( @xcite ) found a cf @xmath6 north of the nucleus and a spiral - like tail .",
    "we obtained new 30 ks chandra / acis - s images of the central regions of both groups that confirm the cf plus spiral tail structure in ngc  7618 and find a similar morphology in ugc  12491 .",
    "these cfs , the clear spiral - shaped gas asymmetries or tails in both groups and their nearly identical recessional velocities",
    "@xcite suggest a group / group merger taking place almost entirely in the plane of the sky .",
    "this favorable viewing geometry and the proximity of the groups make this an ideal target to study the gas dynamics of the merger process .    in this letter",
    ", we discuss the distorted morphologies of the cfs present in both galaxies and the khi as the likely origin of the distortions .",
    "a detailed analysis of the dynamic and thermodynamic state of the gas in this pair will be presented in a separate publication ( m. machacek et al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a short description of our data . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss the merger history of this pair of groups",
    ". finally , in section 4 , we present the distorted morphology of the cfs and discuss the implications of our results .",
    "ngc  7618 and ugc  12491 were observed for 34.5 and 33.2 ks with chandra / acis - s ( obsids 7895 and 7896 ) , respectively , as part of the hrc guaranteed time observation program ( pi : s. s. murray ) .",
    "the data were filtered for periods of high background .",
    "intervals where the rate in the 10 - 12 kev band was more than 3@xmath7 above the mean rate were removed . after filtering ,",
    "32.15 and 31.1 ks of good time remained for ngc  7618 and ugc  12491 , respectively .",
    "bad pixels , hot columns , columns along node boundaries and point sources were also removed .",
    "all data were processed with ciao version 4.3 .",
    "we used blank sky background sets appropriate for the observation date and instrument configuration renormalized to agree with the observations in the @xmath8kev energy band , where particle background is expected to dominate . for more detail on the reduction and analysis procedures ,",
    "see machacek et al .",
    ", in preparation .",
    "a mosaic of the ngc  7618 and ugc  12491 field is shown in figure  [ fig : largescale ] .",
    "both groups show characteristic gas sloshing features ( see @xcite for a detailed list ) , i.e.  the arc - shaped cfs around the cores in a spiral - like fashion , and the spiral - shaped brightness excesses ( or spiral tails ) extending to several cf radii .",
    "ngc  7618 shows a clear arc - shaped surface brightness discontinuity 20 kpc to the north of the nucleus , and a spiral tail that curves from the south through the east and north .",
    "ugc  12491 exhibits a very similar structure but at a rotated orientation  a surface brightness discontinuity to the south - west of",
    "the nucleus and a spiral tail curving from east over north then west .",
    "temperature measurements using the mean energy in the fe l peak ( @xmath9kev ) as a proxy of temperature ( @xcite ) confirm the brighter side of the surface brightness discontinuities to be the cooler one and thus the discontinuities to be cfs .",
    "the morphological comparison of the orientation of the cfs and the spiral tails to sloshing simulations @xcite suggests that both galaxy groups passed each other such that ugc  12491 came from the east - south - east and passed south - west of ngc  7618 .",
    "we estimate the time since the closest passage between the groups in two ways .",
    "first , the almost identical redshifts of both group centers indicate a merger in the plane of the sky .",
    "the average group gas temperatures are @xmath10 kev , corresponding to a sound speed of @xmath11 . around pericenter passage in cluster mergers",
    ", the relative velocity between both clusters varies between mach 1 and 2 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , merger partners on orbits with close encounters reach up to mach 3 at pericenter passage . in the case of the ngc 7618/ugc 12491 merger , both groups are of similar mass , but their cores have not been destroyed but only disturbed , which argues against a close encounter . hence , assuming an average relative velocity between mach 1.5 ( @xmath12 ) and mach 2 ( @xmath13 ) since their closest approach , the projected distance of 300 kpc translates into an age of around 0.3 gyr .",
    "second , as the outwards motion of sloshing cfs is mainly governed by the host potential , the distance of the cfs from the center depends mainly on the time since the closest encounter .",
    "although the velocity of the cfs can in principle differ from cluster to cluster , @xcite found similar cf velocities for virgo and abell 496 . only in more massive clusters , like a2029 ,",
    "do the cfs progress out faster ( @xcite ) . in all simulated systems ,",
    "the cfs move with approximately constant velocity .",
    "virgo is the least massive of these three systems .",
    "assuming that the cfs in ngc  7618 and ugc  12491 move at about the same velocity as in virgo ( @xmath14 , see fig .  7 in @xcite )",
    ", the group - centric distance of 20 kpc of the cfs in both groups translates into an age of about 0.36 gyr , consistent with the first estimate .",
    "but for ugc  12491 , gaussian - smoothed to 4 arcsec.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .number of counts in elliptical regions shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : n7618_counts ] . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we calculate the numerical values for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for cfs in different clusters in table  [ tab : examples ] .",
    "we derive the kinematic viscosity @xmath17 from the spitzer value for the viscosity , @xmath18 ( @xcite ) , assuming a coulomb logarithm of @xmath19 , icm densities and temperatures as measured at each cf , and shear velocities either derived from simulations ( for virgo , a496 ) or assuming shear velocities of mach 0.4 , a typical value found in sloshing simulations . additionally , we list for each cf its distance to the cluster center and its age as derived by simulations ( for virgo and a496 ) or from the cluster - centric distance and a constant cf velocity as described above .",
    "abell 2142 is somewhat hotter than the massive cluster simulated by @xcite . assuming that the cfs in abell 2142 move outwards with the same velocity as in this simulated cluster , we estimate that the sloshing in abell 2142 was triggered about 2 gyr ago . sloshing cfs",
    "generally span more than 90 degrees in position angle and thus more than their @xmath20 in azimuthal extent .",
    "the estimates of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see table  [ tab : examples ] ) imply that viscosity does not significantly suppress the growth of khis in groups and poor clusters , because it can affect only perturbations at spatial scales significantly smaller than the cf radius or azimuthal extent . also the estimated growth times are much shorter than the age of the cfs .",
    "consequently , we should observe khis in ngc  7618 , ugc  12491 and a496 , which all show distorted fronts .",
    "in ngc  7618 and ugc  12491 , the khis may grow even more rapidly , because in this roughly equal mass merger the shear flows along the fronts may be stronger than the mach @xmath00.4 assumed here , which are typical for minor mergers .",
    "the northern front in virgo should also exhibit khis , which may be hidden in the low spatial resolution of the current shallow xmm - newton observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the hot cluster abell 2142 are largest both in absolute terms and in comparison to the cf radii , and the viscosity is expected to have the strongest effect here .",
    "indeed , there is no obvious evidence for khi in the current chandra data .",
    "a similarly diverse picture arises regarding the structure or smoothness of merger cfs , i.e.  the interfaces between the atmospheres of a cluster and an infalling subcluster or galaxy .",
    "@xcite find that a tangential magnetic field of about 10 @xmath18 g is required to prevent khi at the smooth merger cf in abell 3667 .",
    "@xcite have shown that such magnetic draping layers can form . however , @xcite argue that the absence of the khi near the stagnation point can be due to a small , unobservable intrinsic width of the curved front and the spatial variation of the shear flow along it .",
    "@xcite suggest that the wings of the merger cf in a3667 indeed break up in khis .",
    "recent deep chandra and xmm observations of the merger fronts at the elliptical galaxies ngc 4552 ( @xcite ) and ngc 4472 ( @xcite ) falling into the virgo cluster reveal significant substructure , i.e.  horns , kinks and noses for both .",
    "in contrast , the upstream edge of ngc 1404 ( @xcite ) falling into the fornax cluster is not distorted .",
    "like the sloshing cfs , some merger cfs are also distorted while others are not .",
    "the reason for this difference is yet unclear , it may be of dynamical nature , e.g.  the amplitude of shear flow velocity or density contrast , or depend on the magnetic fields or transport coefficients of the icm .",
    "our simple estimate regarding the growth timescales of khis in the linear regime neglects several important issues that are relevant for real cfs : ( i ) the interface is not plane - parallel but curved , and the shear flow along it may vary with position and time .",
    "this is especially true for the merger cfs . in sloshing cfs ,",
    "the interface moves away from the cluster center , stretching growing perturbations .",
    "this increases the growth time because the perturbation length increases and because the density at the interface decreases .",
    "( ii ) the growth time scales refer to the initial linear growth phase only .",
    "the evolution of cfs takes place on much longer timescales , where the khi enters the non - linear regime .",
    "( iii ) for a spitzer - like viscosity , the kinematic viscosity is not constant across the interface , but the ratio of reynolds numbers , between the hot and cold layer , scales with temperature contrast to the power of 3.5 .",
    "( iv ) the effect of tangential magnetic fields and viscosity may combine in suppressing the khi .",
    "the recent and upcoming deep and high resolution observations of merging and sloshing cold fronts provide us with a wealth of information regarding the presence or absence of khis at both sloshing and merger cfs and hence the amplitude of magnetic fields and viscosity in the icm .",
    "understanding the data requires a systematic study of group and cluster cfs to determine which conditions lead to the growth or suppression of the khi .",
    "the list of complications given above makes clear that simple 1 or 2d analogues will not be sufficient to precisely interpret the observations .",
    "additionally , both the required magnetic field strengths and viscosity for the suppression of the khi depend also on the dynamical conditions like local density and shear velocity . simulations tailored specifically to the object in question are required to correctly interpret the data .",
    "the direct comparison of the overall properties of the cfs , i.e.  positions and contrasts across them , allows the merger history and thus the current and recent dynamical state of the icm to be constrained , e.g.  densities , temperatures and shear flow histories at the cfs .",
    "consequently , these dynamical properties can be disentangled from the icm viscosity and magnetic field strengths , and these can be measured .",
    "we will follow this strategy in a series of forthcoming papers .",
