    "investigation of the quark dynamics inside hadrons remains as before the most important task of theoretical and experimental studies in hadronic physics . in view of asymptotic freedom in qcd",
    ", this problem at small distances can be treated in the framework of perturbative calculations .",
    "however at distances like hadron size @xmath0 and larger nonperturbative effects become important . therefore in this",
    "region lattice simulations and string models are used for revealing the interquark interaction ( for a review and further references , see , e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "usually one assumes that at distances @xmath1 the most important are such configurations of gluonic field when this field is concentrated along the line connecting quarks ( the flux tube between quarks ) .",
    "such infinitely thin flux tube is simulated by relativistic string . in the most simple case ,",
    "the dynamics of this system is determined by the nambu ",
    "goto string action  @xcite .",
    "however other string models were also proposed to describe quark interaction , for example polyakov ",
    "kleinert rigid string  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "search for new string models is stimulated by comparing the calculations in qcd with those in the framework of known string models  @xcite .",
    "a large body of literature is devoted to the calculation of the interquark potential in string models ( see , for example ,  @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the central point in these calculations is a determination of the string energy as a function of the distance between quarks .",
    "when deconfinement temperature ( or critical temperature ) is investigated then the dependence of the effective string tension on temperature should be calculated .",
    "practically in all these investigations only the static interquark potential has been considered .",
    "it means that the ends of the string connecting quarks are fixed . on the one hand",
    ", this assumption essentially simplifies the problem because the string frequencies in this case are integer . on the other hand ,",
    "results obtained in this way are applied , strictly speaking , only to the infinitely heavy quarks which can not move .",
    "however in this case the notion of the interquark potential practically loses its usefulness .    as a matter of fact",
    "static string potential is treated , after its derivation , as a usual potential describing the interaction between quarks with finite masses .",
    "here it is implicitly assumed that the interquark potential is a smooth function of quark mass @xmath2 when @xmath3 .",
    "probably it is right .",
    "calculation of the interquark potential generated by string with massive ends carried out in our recent paper  @xcite testifies to this conclusion .",
    "nevertheless we would like to draw attention to one peculiarity in energy spectrum of the relativistic string with heavy quarks at its ends which is , to our view , very important .",
    "the point is that the position of the first excited level in this system depends on the quark mass @xmath2 and when @xmath3 this level may be arbitrary close to the ground state .",
    "obviously this testifies to the infrared instability of the string connecting quarks with sufficiently large masses .",
    "it is this problem that will be discussed in our short comunication .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in section 2 the basic facts from the classical and quantum theories of the nambu ",
    "goto string with massive ends are given .",
    "then linearization of equations of motion and boundary conditions is considered .",
    "it should be noted here that it is these linearized equations that are used as a starting point in all the calculations of the interquark potential in string models both in perturbation theory and by making use of the functional integration ( variational estimations ) .",
    "therefore the spectrum of eigenfrequencies in this system is of great importance . in section 3",
    "the quark mass dependence of the string spectrum is investigated .",
    "it is shown that the energy of the first excited level , @xmath4 , may be arbitrary close to the ground state with energy @xmath5 when quark mass tends to infinity .",
    "this is a direct indication about the infrared instability in the system under consideration . in conclusion ( section 4 )",
    "the physical implications of this result and possible modifications of the string model for removing this drawback are shortly discussed .",
    "the nambu  goto string with point  like masses attached to its ends is described by action  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is infinitesimal area of the string world surface , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , are the world trajectories of the string massive ends , @xmath10 are the quark masses ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath12 is the string tension . in hadronic physics one",
    "usually sets @xmath13  gev .",
    "the gauss parametrization of the string world surface embedded into @xmath14dimensional space ",
    "time with signature @xmath15    @xmath16 @xmath17 permits us to write the induced metric on this surface , @xmath18 , in the following way @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 . from eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) it follows that in the quadratic approximation the determinant @xmath22 of the induced metric is given by @xmath23 in this approximation , the infinitesimal area @xmath7 can be written as @xmath24 \\,dt\\,dr$ ] , while the line elements @xmath25 take the form @xmath26\\,dt$ ] .",

    "( 2.13 ) is the casimir energy  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate the behaviour of the energy levels in string spectrum at large quark masses . to this end , let us separate the integer part in each root of eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) @xmath50 where the correction @xmath51 to the frequencies @xmath42 depends on quark masses . by substituting eq .  ( 3.1 ) into eq .  ( 2.12 ) , one finds , for arbitrary @xmath52 and in the limit @xmath53 , that @xmath51 satisfies the following equation @xmath54 it means that @xmath55 when @xmath56 .",
    "solution to eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) for @xmath57 is @xmath58 for @xmath59 we have @xmath60    energy levels of the system are calculated by making use of eq .",
    "the energy of the first excited state , @xmath4 , is @xmath61 for fixed string tension @xmath62 and string length @xmath63 , the energy @xmath4 decreases for raising values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath40 . from physical point of view",
    ", this behaviour of @xmath4 implies the instability of the string with heavy quarks at its ends .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of the dimensionless energy of the first excited state @xmath64 on the dimensionless quark mass @xmath65 ( bold  face curve ) .",
    "this curve is obtained for the string length of order ofthe hadron size . from frequency equation ( 2.12 )",
    "one can easily deduce the following scaling property of its roots .",
    "let the functions @xmath66 determine the roots of this equation for given value of the mass parameter @xmath67 and for @xmath68 i.e. @xmath69 then for arbitrary string length @xmath70 the following scaling rule holds @xmath71 ] @xmath72 . when @xmath73 ( region of the top quark mass ) we have @xmath74 .",
    "there are no any restrictions on the number of excitations with energy @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we really have infinite sequence of equidistant energy levels @xmath75 which is superimposed on the basic string spectrum with scale @xmath62 ( see eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) ) . as a consequence , for sufficiently large quark masses",
    "the ground state of the string becomes fuzzy , i.e. weak , compared with @xmath62 , external perturbations will result in excitation of the string ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "obviously this implies the infrared instability in this system .",
    "it should be noted that all these considerations are applicable to the rigid string too .",
    "in fact , in ref .  @xcite the same frequency equation as ( 2.11 ) was derived in the model of the rigid string with massive ends .    where may this infrared instability be manifested ? at first , when going beyond the linear approximation in string model . to this end",
    "we have to take into account the `` interaction '' in the string action ( 2.4 ) which is described by terms @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "besides , this infrared instability may be revealed in calculations at finite temperature . for example , effective string potential generated by linearized string action ( 2.4 ) is obtained by functional intagration over `` field '' @xmath78 . as a result ,",
    "one arrives at the following well known expression  @xcite @xmath79\\,{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 are the matsubara frequencies and @xmath81 are the roots of eq .",
    "when @xmath3 , @xmath82 and we obtain infinity in ( 3.7 ) .",
    "on the other hand , calculations in string models with fixed ends are well defined at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "the instability of the relativistic string , connecting heavy quarks is quiet clear because fixed string tension @xmath12 proves to be insufficient to keep in bound state very heavy quarks . in the framework of the string approach to hadron physics",
    "this instability apparently implies that string  like collective excitations of gluon field do not dominate in heavy quark dynamics . though other points of view can be proposed .",
    "for example , one way suppose that string tension for heavy quarks should be greater than @xmath12 .",
    "however the following problem arises here : in what way this assumption can be put in agreement with basic concepts of qcd .    in the same way one may doubt in applicability of the linearized string action ( 2.5 ) which has been used to derive frequency equation ( 2.12 ) . but in this case it would be difficult to understand why this action is good for description of the string with light quarks at its ends or for fixed string ends but is not applicable to heavy quarks . proceeding from simple physical considerations",
    "one may expect that situation should be opposite because linearization of the string action is , in some sense , equivalent to the nonrelativistic approximation ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "thus the problem of infrared instability in the dynamics of the relativistic string connecting sufficiently heavy quarks remains , in our opinion , open .",
