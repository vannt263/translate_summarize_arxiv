    "the standard big bang cosmological model is based on four cornerstones : the hubble expansion , the cosmic microwave background radiation(cmbr ) , primordial big bang nucleosynthesis and structure formation .",
    "recent observations of the hubble relation of distant type ia supernovae have provided strong evidence for the acceleration of the universe ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; riess et al . 1998 ) .",
    "while current measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies favor a spatially flat universe with cold dark matter @xcite , both the deuterium abundance measured in four high redshift hydrogen clouds seen in absorption against distant quasars ( burles & tytler 1998a , b ) ( combined with baryon fraction in galaxy clusters from x - ray data , see white et al . 1993 ) and the large - scale structure in the distribution of galaxies @xcite have made a strong case for a low density universe ( for a recent summary , see turner 2002 ) .",
    "all these observations can be concordantly explained by the hypothesis that there exists , in addition to cold dark matter , a dark energy component with negative pressure in our universe @xcite .",
    "the existence of this component has also been independently confirmed by other observations such as age estimates of old high - redshift galaxies @xcite and gravitational lensing ( kochaneck 1996 ; chiba & yoshii 1999 ; futamase & hamana 1999 ; jain et al .",
    "2001 ; dev et al .",
    "2001 ; ohyama et al .",
    "2002 ) .    during past several years , a huge number of candidates for the dark energy component have been proposed , such as a cosmological constant @xcite , a frustrated network of topological defects ( such as cosmic strings or domain walls ) ( vilenkin 1984 ; davis 1987 ; kamionkowski & toumbas 1996 ) and an evolving scalar field ( referred to by some as quintessence ) ( ratra & peebles 1988 ; frieman et al .",
    "1995 ; coble et al . 1997 ; caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ) . despite great effort to pin down the amount and the nature of the dark energy , a convincing mechanism with a solid basis in particle physics that explains the accelerating universe is still far off .",
    "very recently , freese & lewis ( 2002 ) proposed a `` cardassian expansion scenario '' in which the universe is flat , matter dominated and accelerating , but contains no vacuum contribution .",
    "the main point of this scenario is to modify the standard friedman - robertson - walker equation as following , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hubble parameter ( as a function of time ) , @xmath8 is the scale factor of the universe , and the energy density @xmath9 contains only ordinary matter and radiation @xcite . the second term , which may arise as a consequence of brane world cosmologies , drives the acceleration of the universe at a late epoch when it is dominent .",
    "the authors claimed that this cardassian model survives observational tests such as the cosmic microwave background radiation , the age of the universe , the cluster baryon fraction and structure formation , and they are now studying possible observational tests @xcite . in this paper , we give the first observational constraint on this scenario from recent measurements of the angular size of high-@xmath0 compact radio sources made by gurvits et al .",
    "we show that , although this cardassian expansion proposal is cosmologically credible and compatible with the @xmath5 diagram for some values of the mean projected linear size @xmath3 , it is disfavoured by the best fit to the current angular size data when compared with the conventional flat @xmath4cdm model .",
    "our result is very similar to the one of avelino & martins ( 2002 ) who used type ia supernovae data to show another particular solution of a brane world scenario being disfavoured .",
    "there is a common point among these analysis : both models predict a universe with unreasonably low matter density .",
    "we begin by evaluating the angular diameter distance as a function of redshift @xmath0 as well as the parameters of the model . following the notation of peebles ( 1993 )",
    ", we define the redshift dependence of @xmath10 as @xmath11 . for the ansatz of eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) and a flat universe with only matter ( baryonic and cold dark matter ) , freese & lewis ( 2002 ) get @xmath12 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the two paramters of the cardassian model . note that @xmath2 is the redshift at which the two terms of eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) are equal .",
    "the coefficients of the ansatz of eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) can be written as @xmath13 and @xmath14^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath15kms@xmath16mpc@xmath16 is the hubble constant and @xmath17 is the matter density of the universe at the present time .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the angular diameter distance is given by @xmath18 in order to give an observational constraint on the cardassian model parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we analysis the angular size data for milliarcsecond radio sources recently compiled by gurvits et al .",
    "this data set is 145 sources distributed into twelve redshift bins with about the same number of sources per bin ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the lowest and highest redshift bins are centered at redshifts @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "we determine the model parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 through a @xmath21 minimization method .",
    "the range of @xmath1 spans the interval [ 0 , 1 ] in steps of 0.01 , while the range of @xmath2 spans the interval [ 0 , 2 ] in steps of 0.02 .",
    "@xmath22^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the angle subtended by an object of proper length @xmath3 transverse to the line of sight and @xmath24 is the observed values of the angular size with errors @xmath25 of the @xmath26th bin in the sample .",
    "the summation is over all the observational data points .    in the cardassian model for a flat universe containing only matter , the matter density in units of critical density , @xmath27 , is @xmath28^{-1}$ ] . instead of specifying @xmath29 , we consider both @xmath1 and @xmath2 as independent paramters , while @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) is treated as the output of the fitting result . as was pointed out by gurvits",
    "et al.(1999 ) , lima & alcaniz(2002 ) and alcaniz(2002 ) , when one use the angular size data to constrain the cosmological parameters , the results will be strongly dependent on the characteristic length @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , instead of assuming a specific value for @xmath3 , we have worked on the interval @xmath31pc . in fig .  2",
    ", we show contours of constant likelihood ( 95.4% and 68.3% c.l . ) in the plane ( @xmath32 ) for several values of @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath33pc .",
    "table  1 summarizes our best fits for different values of @xmath3 , for example , at @xmath34pc , the best fit occurs for @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( hence @xmath37 ) . in order to make the analysis independent of the choice of the characteristic length @xmath3",
    ", we also minimize eq.([eq : chi2 ] ) for @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which gives @xmath38pc , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( hence @xmath41 ) as the best fit with @xmath42 and 9 degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , it seems that the best fit to the current angular size data prefers the conventional flat @xmath4cdm model to this cardassian expansion proposal , though the latter is cosmologically credible and compatible with the @xmath5 diagram for some values of @xmath3 .",
    "although the evidence for an accelerating universe is increasing from various astronomical observations , understanding the mechanism based on particle physics is still one of the most important challenges in modern cosmology .",
    "the `` cardassian expansion scenario '' proposed by freese & lewis ( 2002 ) is one intriguing possibility , because it assumes the universe is flat , matter dominated and accelerating , but contains no vacuum contribution .",
    "we have used the updated angular size data to give the first observational constraint for this scenario . as it shown , although this cardassian model is credible and compatible with the @xmath5 diagram for some specific values of @xmath3 , it is disfavored by the present angular size data because of its prediction of a universe with unreasonably low matter density .",
    "ignorance of the characterisitic length @xmath3 is one of the major uncertainties in the present analysis .",
    "one method to overcome it is to do the analysis over a large enough range of @xmath3 to include almost all of the possibilities , and then to calculate the probability distribution for the model parameters by integrating over @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , this will loosen the cosmological constraints , making a larger range of model parameters plausible . in this sense",
    ", the cardassian proposal will be more compatible with the present angular size data if we take into account the uncertainty of @xmath3 .",
    "another uncertainty comes from the possibility that the source linear size is dependent on the source luminosity and redshift , i.e. , the sources are not ` true ' standard rods @xcite . parametrizing the effects of these dependence as @xmath43 , gurvits et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and vishwakarma ( 2001 ) have shown that the analysis with and without @xmath44 and @xmath45 are basically consistent .",
    "it is reasonable , for the data compiled by gurvits et al .",
    "has been minimized for this dependence by discarding low values of luminosities and extreme values of spectral indices @xcite .",
