    "light emitted by a laser ( b ) in a collimated beam strikes a diffuse surface , the _ diffuser wall _ at a single point l. the laser emits pulses that are much shorter than 1  ps in time , or 0.3  mm in space . from point l light",
    "is diffusely scattered in all directions .",
    "a small fraction of the light travels a distance @xmath2 and strikes point s. at s the light is diffusely reflected once again and some of it travels to point w covering the distance @xmath3 . from w some light travels back to the camera c. the camera observes points on the wall with high time resolution , such that light having traveled different total distances through the scene is detected at different times .    by scanning the position of l , and exploiting the spatial resolution of the camera we can probe different sets of light paths .",

    "the first segment is the collimated laser beam travelling from the laser source to the wall . in the second segment",
    "the laser spot on the wall behaves as a point light source and light travels from there into the hidden scene .",
    "the third segment(s ) involve scattering from the hidden object . for the fourth segment light",
    "travels from the wall to the camera _ which is focused on the wall_. the data received by the camera @xmath4 has two degrees of freedom - space and time . since the first and fourth segments are focused , we can apply transforms to the streak images to eliminate their effects .",
    "the effect of the first segment can be removed by shifting the streak images in time for each laser location on the wall . to remove the effect of the fourth segment we use the distances between the wall pixels and the camera sensors @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that we know the geometry of @xmath6 to calculate the camera - to - wall homography and the correspondence between the camera and wall pixels .",
    "the following mathematical formulation is a concise representation of this concept . here",
    "@xmath7 is the projective transformation ( homography ) mapping coordinates on @xmath6 to camera coordinates .",
    "the time shift @xmath8 by the distance from camera to screen varies hyperbolically with the pixel coordinate @xmath9 .",
    "note that we do nt require to adjust for a @xmath10 factor or @xmath11 fall off because the camera sensor integrates for more wall pixels if they are farther away .",
    "@xmath12        let us analyze the scattering of light in the second and third segments . for simplicity we model the hidden object as a collection of unfocused emitters sending impulses @xmath13 at times @xmath14 .",
    "we model the receiver as an array of unfocused receivers which capture photons at picosecond resolution .",
    "we can achieve this configuration experimentally by using a picoseond resolution streak camera focused on the diffuser wall pixels .",
    "the following mathematical equation represents the data recorded by the streak camera after making the mentioned assumptions . by measuring time in distance units",
    "we can set the speed of light to @xmath15 for simplicity .",
    "we also ignore the local changes in normals for sender surface and receiver surface .",

    "and @xmath21 is the intensity observed at @xmath17 at time @xmath22 .",
    "after removing the time shifts as described in the previous section and applying transforms from the calculated homography we can further simplify the equation and remove the @xmath23 required to adjust for receiver camera distances .",
    "the following equation provides a mathematical summary of this analysis .",
    "note that over all these equations we assume that the receiver and sender are perfectly lambertian and ignore the local variation in normal vectors .",
    "equation hence becomes @xmath24      let us analyze the relationship between the time when a sender emits a pulse and the time and location of a receiver detecting the light . for a fixed sender the response function is a hyperboloid in space and time given by the following mathematical equation . the parameters of the hyperboloid depend on location of sender , a lateral displacement leads to shifts , while a displacement in depth corresponds to flattening .",
    "change in sender time equates to a constant time shift for responses to any of the receivers : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the two coordinates of @xmath9 in the receiver plane .",
    "careful observation shows that this equation describes an ellipsoid in sender location if we fix the laser and receiver location .",
    "the ellipsoid s parameters depend on the time at which a receiver receives an impulse .",
    "the laser spot and the receiver ( on the wall ) constitute the two foci of this ellipsoid .",
    "the eccentricity depends on the time when the impulse is received .",
    "in this section we rephrase the above approximation to the forward light transport using notions from tomography . in an idealized case",
    ", the inverse problem of recovering the hidden shape can be solved explicitly .",
    "we use this explicit solution to inspire our algorithm for real world scenarios .",
    "our problem has similarities to tomographic projection .",
    "let us rewrite equation in the following form @xmath28    where the unknown world volume @xmath29 is a delta function with support on the surface @xmath30 to be reconstructed .",
    "apart from the @xmath11 factors , which typically vary slowly over the region of interest , we hence see that individual streak image pixels measure elliptical projections of the world volume @xmath31 . due to its similarity with traditional tomography",
    ", we call this problem _ elliptical tomography_. note however that there are also key differences to traditional tomography : ( i ) the recorded projections live in a higher dimensional ( 5d ) space than the world ( 3d ) .",
    "( ii ) the projections are along ( 2d ) ellipsoids instead of ( 1d ) lines .",
    "this makes the analysis much more complicated .",
    "it is instructive to consider the above tomography problem in the limit when the object is small compared to the distance to the diffuser wall . in this case",
    "the elliptic tomography problem reduces to a planar tomography problem , see figure [ fig : tomography ] .",
    "each pair of a camera point and a laser position on the diffuser wall ( approximately ) measures intersections of the target object with planes whose normals agree with the normals to the ellipsoids . by the standard fourier slice theorem ,",
    "each line of each streak image will hence measure one line of the fourier transform of the object , in the direction of the normal .",
    "unfortunately , in our situation these normals cover a limited region of the unit sphere .",
    "hence without additional priors it is not possible to reconstruct the fourier transform of the target object in the missing directions .",
    "this is the missing cones problem well known from traditional tomography .",
    "experimentally we get a very good resolution in the depth ( orthogonal to the wall ) direction , while transverse ( parallel to the wall ) high frequency features tend to get lost .",
    "the top left figure shows streak images being generated by near field sources . on bottom",
    "left we see effect when this sources travel farther away , the rightmost figure depicts how we can analytically predict single sources using multiple sensor laser combinations .",
    "notice how the accuracy is effected if lasers shift.,width=528 ]",
    "in this section we give a detailed description of our reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the imaging and reconstruction process consists of 3 phases :    * * phase 1 : data acquisition .",
    "* we direct the laser to 60 different positions on the diffuser wall and capture the corresponding streak images . for each of the 60 positions xx images",
    "are taken and overlayed to reduce noise . *",
    "* phase 2 : data preprocessing . *",
    "the streak images are loaded , intensity corrected and shifted to adjust for spatiotemporal jitter . * * phase 3 : 3d reconstruction . *",
    "the clean streak images are used to reconstruct the unknown shape using our backprojection - type algorithm .",
    "the first of the three phases has been described above .",
    "let us focus on phases 2 and 3 .      1 .",
    "* timing correction . * to correct for drift in camera timing synchronization ( jitter ) both in space and time we direct part of the laser directly to the diffuser wall .",
    "this produces a sharp `` calibration spot '' in each streak image .",
    "the calibration spot is detected in each image , and the image is subsequently shifted in order to align the reference spot at the same pixel location in all streak images .",
    "the severity of the jitter is monitored in order to detect outliers or broken datasets .",
    "* intensity correction .",
    "* to remove a common bias in the streak images we subtract a reference ( background ) image taken without the target object being present in the setup .",
    "3 .   * gain correction .",
    "* we correct for non - uniform gain of the streak camera s ccd sensor by dividing by a white light image taken beforehand",
    ".      1 .   * voxel grid setup .",
    "* we estimate an oriented bounding box for the working volume to set up a voxel grid ( see below ) .",
    "* downsampling ( optional ) . * in order to improve speed the data may be downsampled by discarding a fraction of the cameras pixels for each streak image and/or entire streak images .",
    "experiments showed that every second camera pixel may be discarded without losing much reconstruction accuracy .",
    "when discarding entire streak images , is is important that the laser positions on the diffuser wall corresponding to the remaining images still cover a large area .",
    "* backprojection .",
    "* for each voxel in the working volume and for each streak image , we compute the streak image pixels that the voxel under consideration might have contributed .",
    "concretely , the voxel at location @xmath27 can contributed to a pixel corresponding to a point @xmath9 on the wall at time @xmath22 if @xmath32 here",
    "@xmath33 is the camera s center of projection and @xmath34 is the laser position as above .",
    "let us call the streak image pixels satisfying this condition the _ contributing pixels_. we compute a function on voxel space , the _ heatmap _ @xmath7 .",
    "for the voxel @xmath27 under consideration we assign the value @xmath35 here the sum is over all contributing pixels @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the intensity measured at that pixel .",
    "the prefactor corrects for the distance attenuation , with @xmath38 being some constant .",
    "we use @xmath39 .",
    "* filtering . *",
    "the heatmap @xmath7 now is a function on our 3 dimensional voxel grid .",
    "we assume that the axis of that grid are ordered such that the third axis faces away from the diffuser wall .",
    "we compute the _ filtered heatmap _ @xmath40 as the second derivative of the heatmap along that third axis of the voxel grid . @xmath41 the filtered heatmap measures the confidence we have that at a specific voxel location there is a surface patch of the hidden object .",
    "* thresholding . *",
    "we compute a sliding window maximum @xmath42 of the filtered heatmap @xmath40 .",
    "typically we use a 20x20x20 voxel window .",
    "our estimate of the 3d shape to be reconstructed consists of those voxels that satisfy the condition @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the global maximum of the filtered heatmap and @xmath45 , @xmath46 are constants .",
    "typically we use @xmath47 , @xmath48 6 .",
    "* compressive reconstruction * + we use techniques like spgl1 , and cosamp  @xcite as an alternative to back projection and filtering .",
    "we rely on the fact that the 3d voxel grid is sparsely filled , containing surfaces which can occupy only one voxel in depth .",
    "since spgl1 uses only matrix vector multiplications . 7 .",
    "* rendering . * the result of thresholding step is a 3d point cloud .",
    "we use the chimera rendering software to visualize this point cloud .    in order to set up the voxel grid in the first step we run a low resolution version of the above algorithm with a conservative initial estimate of the region of interest .",
    "in particular , we greatly down sample the input data . by this",
    "we obtain a low resolution point cloud which is a coarse approximation to the object to be reconstructed .",
    "we compute the center of mass and principal axis of this point cloud .",
    "the voxel grid is then fit so as to align with these axis .      to motivate our choice of filter by taking the second derivative ,",
    "let us consider again the planar ( `` far field '' ) approximation to the elliptical tomography problem as discussed in section [ sec : missingcones ] . in this setting , at least for full and uniform coverage of the sphere with plane directions ,",
    "the theoretically correct filtering in the filtered backprojection algorithm is a @xmath49 filter in fourier space . in image space",
    ", this amounts to taking a second derivative along each scanline .",
    "this motivates our choice of filter above .",
    "we tested both filtering by the second derivative in image and world space and found that taking the derivative approximately along the target surfaces normal yielded the best results .    simulated reconstruction using cosamp . while cosamp promises to perform far superior on a perfectly calibrated system , it is outperformed by backprojection on the current data due to calibration inaccuracies.,width=528 ]      we attempted compressive reconstructions with cosamp on real as well as simulated data .",
    "we found that cosamp performs better than backprojection on simulated data .",
    "the situation is reversed with data from the actual system .",
    "we attribute the poor performance of cosamp and other linear equation based methods with real data to bias in the data due to imperfect calibration in the system .",
    "a result of a simulated cosamp reconstruction is shown in figure  [ fig : cosamp ]",
    "our streak camera is a hamamatsu c5680 , with an internal time resolution of 2  picoseconds .",
    "we use a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser to generate pulses at 795  nm wavelength with about 50  femtosecond pulse duration at a repetition rate of 75  mhz . the laser s average output power is about 500  mw .",

    "the visible parts of the geometry could be measured with the laser directly using time of flight with micrometer precision .",
    "methods like lidar and oct can achieve this and are well understood . in the interest of focusing on the novel components of our system we instead measure the visible parts of our scene with the faro gauge .",
    "we also collect ground truth data to validate our reconstructions .",

    "on the other hand the backprojection algorithm turned out to be quite robust to calibration errors , though they can deteriorate the obtained resolution . since we typically have to deal with some calibration error ( see section [ sec : experiments ] )",
    ", we used the backprojection algorithm to obtain the real data reconstruction results of this paper .",
    "designing a perfectly calibrated system is an interesting research challenge .",
    "research directions here include the development of a model for lens distortions in the streak camera system and a scheme for their compensation , as well as a method of actively and autonomously recalibrating the system to account for day to day variations and drift in laser operation and laser - camera synchronization wile capturing data .",
    "the ability to infer shapes of objects beyond the line of sight is an ambitious goal but it may transform recoding of visual information and will require a new set of algorithms for scene understanding , rendering and visualization . we have presented a new shape - from - x approach that goes beyond the abilities of today s model acquisition and scanning methods .",
    "light transport with a time component presents a unique challenge due to the lack of correspondence but also provides a new opportunity .",
    "the emphasis in this paper is to present a forward model and novel inversion process .",
    "the nonlinear component due to jitter and system point spread function makes the ultra - fast imaging equipment difficult to use .",
    "so the physical results can only be treated as a proof - of - concept .",
    "one may wonder when ultrafast lasers and cameras will be broadly available to researchers in computer graphics and computational photography .",
    "many lasers have transformed from their unsafe , bulky form factors to use in portable consumer devices . to further the research in this field by the community",
    ", we will make image datasets and matlab code freely available online .",
    "the utility of ultrafast imagers like the streak camera has been limited to analysis of bio - chemical processes making them difficult to use for free space light transport .",
    "we hope our work will spur more applications of these imagers in computational photography and in turn the graphics research will influence the design and cost of future streak cameras ."
