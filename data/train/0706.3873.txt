    "gauge mediation  @xcite is one of the most appealing realizations of the supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , because of its high predictive power and ultraviolet insensitivity .",
    "indeed , the induced soft terms are computable in terms of few parameters ( generally three ) and do not lead to unacceptably large flavor violations , under mild assumptions on the unknown interactions responsible for generating yukawa couplings .",
    "there are two ingredients of gauge mediation that are still obscure .",
    "one is the seed of supersymmetry breaking , which is expected to have a dynamical origin , in order to explain naturally the emergence of mass scales much smaller than the planck mass @xmath3 .",
    "new interactions have to transfer the original supersymmetry breaking from the hidden sector to the messenger fields .",
    "attempts to simplify this structure and unify the hidden and messenger sectors have faced various difficulties .",
    "one of the problems is that , once a hidden sector with supersymmetry breaking is found , the couplings to the messengers allow for new supersymmetric vacua . to address this problem ,",
    "models were constructed  @xcite around metastable false vacua where supersymmetry is broken , although the global minimum remains supersymmetric .",
    "more recently , a new framework of theories with these properties has been discovered  @xcite , showing that this approach is fairly general .",
    "this new development has revived the interest in gauge mediation and led to the construction of many interesting models  @xcite .",
    "the second obscure ingredient is the seed of peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry breaking or , in other words , the origin of @xmath0 , the higgsino mass , and @xmath4 , the square mass mixing the two scalar higgs doublets @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the first aspect of this problem , common to all supersymmetric models , is how to relate @xmath0 to the soft masses of the other supersymmetric particles .",
    "this problem is solved by assuming that the pq symmetry is exact in the supersymmetric limit , while @xmath0 is induced by supersymmetry - breaking effects  @xcite .",
    "the second aspect appears only in theories with computable soft terms , like gauge mediation , and it is expressed by the generic prediction ~fm , [ murel ] where @xmath7 represents the value of the hidden - sector auxiliary field , and @xmath8 is the mass of the mediating field .",
    "equation  ( [ murel ] ) is the consequence of a generic coupling in the khler potential between the higgs bilinear @xmath9 and a spurionic superfield @xmath10 d^4h_d h_u f(x , x^ ) , [ opmu ] where @xmath11 represents the product of coupling constants and possible loop factors required to generate the effective interaction .",
    "the operator in simultaneously generates both @xmath0 and @xmath4 , leading to independently of the actual value of the loop - suppression factor @xmath11 . in gravity - mediated models",
    ", @xmath12 corresponds to the natural scale of soft terms , and is fully satisfactory .",
    "however , in theories where the soft terms are derived from @xmath12 through computable loop effects , like gauge or anomaly  @xcite or gaugino  @xcite mediation , predicts that the ratio @xmath13 is parametrically too large , requiring an unnatural fine tuning .",
    "one solution  @xcite is to construct models where operators of the form ( [ opmu ] ) are absent , while couplings to the hidden sector generate only the structure d^4h_d h_u d^2 f(x , x^ ) , [ opmu2 ] where @xmath14 is the supersymmetric covariant derivative .",
    "since @xmath15 is an antichiral superfield , the operator in generates @xmath0 but not @xmath4 , which is then induced at a higher order in perturbation theory .",
    "other solutions use other dynamical scales present in the hidden sector  @xcite or required by the cancellation of the cosmological constant  @xcite to reproduce acceptable values of @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is also possible to construct models with flavor symmetries  @xcite or an r - symmetry  @xcite , leading to selection rules that invalidate .",
    "an alternative approach is to introduce in the low - energy theory a new sm singlet field @xmath16 coupled to the higgs bilinear in the superpotential w = nh_d h_u - n^3 .",
    "[ supwn ] a @xmath17 symmetry forbids a bare @xmath0 term , and the coupling @xmath18 is needed to break the global pq symmetry .",
    "the effective @xmath0 and @xmath4 terms can now be entirely generated by low - energy dynamics and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , circumventing .    in theories like gravity mediation , where @xmath0 is correctly generated by supersymmetry breaking and",
    "is successful , the introduction of the singlet @xmath16 does not appear to be well motivated .",
    "not only is it superfluous , but it also introduces a proliferation of new unknown parameters in the soft terms .",
    "moreover , a light singlet can potentially destabilize the hierarchy  @xcite , as is the case when we embed the superpotential in into a gut .",
    "the situation is quite different in a theory with low supersymmetry - breaking scale and computable soft terms , like gauge mediation . in this case , the introduction of @xmath16 is essential to bypass and , in principle , it can be done at the price of only two new parameters @xmath21 and @xmath18 ( to be compared with @xmath0 and @xmath4 of the minimal supersymmetric sm ) in the full lagrangian , including soft terms .",
    "moreover , as long as @xmath22  @xcite , the coupling of @xmath16 to gut fields does not destabilize the hierarchy  @xcite , and it can even be used for the sliding - singlet mechanism  @xcite to explain the higgs doublet - triplet splitting , in the limit @xmath23  @xcite .    the use of @xmath16 to generate the @xmath0 term in gauge mediation was immediately suggested in the original paper on the subject  @xcite , but it was also found that the specific form of the soft terms in gauge mediation does not allow for a correct pattern of electroweak breaking with an acceptable mass spectrum .",
    "the main difficulty lies in generating a sufficiently large value of @xmath24 , which requires either a negative soft square mass for the scalar field @xmath16 , or large a - terms for @xmath21 and @xmath18 interactions .",
    "neither of these conditions can be satisfactorily obtained in gauge mediation , unless one introduces new light fields coupled to @xmath16  @xcite , multiple singlets with appropriately adjusted couplings  @xcite , higher - dimensional interactions of @xmath16 with specific values of the exponents  @xcite , or modifies the theory to include a new u(1 ) gauge group , under which @xmath16 is charged , with new associated fields  @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis of these possibilities has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that a negative square mass for @xmath16 and non - vanishing trilinears can be obtained if the singlet is directly coupled to the messenger fields @xmath25 in the superpotential w = x(_1 |_1 _ 1 + _ 2 |_2 _ 2 ) + n |_1 _ 2 , [ wnew ] where @xmath26 is the hidden - sector superfield containing the goldstino .",

    "the doubling of the messenger field is necessary to avoid a kinetic mixing between @xmath26 and @xmath16 . indeed , if both @xmath26 and @xmath16 coupled to the same bilinear @xmath30 , below the messenger mass @xmath8 we would find the one - loop mixing in the effective khler potential d^4n x^ ( ) + h.c . , where @xmath31 is the dimensionality of the gauge representation of @xmath25 .",
