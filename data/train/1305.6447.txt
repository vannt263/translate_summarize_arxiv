    "the quest to explore gravity theory beyond einstein s general theory relativity ( gtr ) on large cosmological scales , in recent years , has been aroused by the prospect of explaining the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "it has now been established beyond any doubt that our universe is currently going through an accelerated expanding phase which has been started in recent past @xcite . the theoretical approach to explain such an acceleration",
    "can be broadly divided into two categories . in one approach , one has to add some exotic component with negative pressure ( known as dark energy ) in the energy budget of the universe as normal matter or radiation component can not initiate accelerated expansion .",
    "simplest of such component , known as cosmological constant ( with equation of state @xmath5 ) can explain all the available cosmological data but at the same time is plagued by the embarrassing problem of fine tuning and cosmic coincidence @xcite .",
    "one can also consider more exotic scalar fields @xcite to mimic the required negative pressure which may solve at least the cosmic coincidence problem and can have far more striking cosmological consequences . unfortunately the presently available cosmological data can not distinguish these two models decisively .",
    "the other approach is to give up the idea of adding extra component in energy budget of the universe but to modify the gravity theory on large cosmological scales .",
    "the idea is to look for departure from the gtr that can effectively mimic a cosmological constant and result the necessary acceleration .",
    "@xmath0 gravity theory @xcite is one such example where instead of linear dependence of the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action on the ricci scalar , one includes nonlinear dependence .",
    "it is particularly interesting and has been studied extensively . recently",
    "a generalization of such theory has been proposed which involves a non - minimal coupling between curvature and matter @xcite . in this model , one extends the presence of non - linear functions of the scalar curvature in the eh action by incorporating an additional term involving the coupling between the ricci scalar and the matter .",
    "astrophysical and cosmological signatures of such non - minimally coupled @xmath0 gravity models have been studied by various authors @xcite ( see also @xcite for similar investigation ) .",
    "however describing background cosmological evolution for any particular model is not sufficient to remove the observed degeneracies between different modified gravity models and @xmath1cdm .",
    "growth of matter perturbation is extremely important in this regard as the evolution equations for growth of matter perturbation are completely different in two scenarios .",
    "this can result characteristic signatures in cmb as well as in matter power spectrum from galaxy clusters which in turn can help to remove the degeneracies between the two models . in a recent paper @xcite the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the presence of non -",
    "minimal coupling between curvature and matter has been studied .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the work done in @xcite to the observational front .",
    "we study how far the present cluster data can distinguish the model with non - minimal coupling between curvature and matter from the standard @xmath1cdm model .",
    "for this we proceed in a two stage manner .",
    "we first look for the possible form for the @xmath0 that can give rise to the same background evolution as in @xmath1cdm universe . after reconstructing the suitable form for the @xmath0",
    ", we calculate the matter power spectrum for such a model and see whether the currently available observational data can distinguish this model from the @xmath1cdm .",
    "the action for non minimally coupled @xmath0 gravity models is given by @xmath6    where @xmath7 , @xmath0 is a dimensionless function of the scalar curvature @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the matter lagrangian .    due to the presence of coupling between the curvature and the matter",
    ", there will be an energy transfer between them which can be seen in the corresponding conservation equation given by @xmath10    the non vanishing term in the r.h.s of the above equation shows the energy transfer between curvature and matter .",
    "this exchange of energy between the curvature and matter is a special feature in non minimally coupled @xmath0 gravity models .",
    "but in a homogenous and isotropic universe , the energy momentum tensor for the matter should have a perfect fluid form and once we assume the form of the matter lagrangian as @xmath11 , @xcite(@xmath12 being the energy density for the matter ) , it is easy to show that @xmath13 is satisfied for the background evolution .    varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath14 , one obtains the einstein s equation as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 .    assuming a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime with scale factor a(t ) @xmath17 the time component of above equation is @xmath18    our first goal is to look for those models that mimic the background evolution for the @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "we know the form of the hubble parameter for the @xmath1cdm universe which is given by @xmath19    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the hubble parameter , matter density parameter and density parameter for cosmological constant at present respectively . for a spatially flat universe , @xmath23 .",
    "with such a background evolution , the equation ( [ zero ] ) takes the form    @xmath24    here @xmath25 represents the first derivative of @xmath26 with respect to the scale factor .",
    "one has to solve this equation to find the form for @xmath26 which can mimic the similar background evolution as in @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "equation ( [ recons ] ) is a second order differential equation and needs two initial conditions , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , to solve .",
    "we solve the equation from the era of decoupling ( @xmath29 ) till present day ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we observe that the behavior does not vary with @xmath28 but is very sensitive to @xmath27 . in figure 1",
    ", we show the different behaviors for @xmath31 and @xmath32 with varying @xmath27 that give rise to the same background evolution as in @xmath1cdm model .",
    "given these forms for @xmath0 that produce identical background evolution as in @xmath1cdm universe , the next question is how different is the growth history of the universe for these non - minimally coupled @xmath0 gravity models from the concordance @xmath1cdm model ? in the next section , we try to address this issue .",
    "perturbed frw metric in longitudinal gauge takes the form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the two gravitational potentials . using equations ( [ eins ] ) and ( [ perturb ] )",
    ", one can obtain the equations for growth in the linear regime :    @xmath36    @xmath37\\delta \\chi=\\nonumber \\\\",

    "next we assume the velocity perturbation as @xmath41    in the frw universe , @xmath42 . also with @xmath43 ,",
    "one can write @xmath44 . the spatial part of the @xmath45 is the peculiar velocity .",
    "writing the spatial part @xmath46 as gradient of a scalar : @xmath47    one can now get the following equations on perturbing equation ( 2 ) : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 . using these two equations ,",
    "one finally arrives at @xmath51      equation ( 16 ) governs the cosmological evolution of the growth of matter over density in a non minimally coupled @xmath0 gravity model which has identical background evolution as in the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "we are interested in the perturbations which are deep inside the hubble radius for which @xmath52 .",
    "we apply the following approximations to calculate the perturbations deep inside the hubble radius @xcite : @xmath53    this actually implies @xmath54 , where @xmath55 + under this approximation , equations ( 9 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 10 ) take the form    @xmath56     from the corresponding @xmath1cdm value for different @xmath27 .",

    ", we use the initial conditions @xmath65 and @xmath66 where we choose @xmath67 , which is the decoupling era .",
    "this is to ensure that the growth evolution reproduces the matter - like behavior during the early time .",
    "growth of matter overdensity is an important independent probe for different cosmological models that explain the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "the growth rate for matter over density is defined as @xmath68    in figure 2 , we show the percentage deviation of the growth factor @xmath69 for the non - minimally coupled @xmath0 gravity model from the corresponding @xmath1cdm model .",
    "one can see that there can be four to six percent deviation one may expect for different values of @xmath27 .",
    "the question is whether such deviation can be probed by the current observational data .",
    "another important quantity related to the growth is the rms fluctuation of the linear density field at the scale @xmath70mpc , @xmath71 .",
    "this defined as    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the window function defined as @xmath74    the quantity @xmath75 as defined in @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the normalized density contrast defined as @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the amplitude of the primordial curvature perturbation produced during inflation , @xmath80 = 0.05 @xmath81 is the pivot scale at which the primordial fluctuation is calculated .",
    "@xmath82 is the transfer function which incorporates the effects of evolution of perturbations through horizon crossing and matter / radiation transition .",
    "we use analytical form for @xmath82 as proposed in @xcite : @xmath83^{-0.25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "galaxy surveys are directly sensitive to the combination @xmath86 .",
    "this combination is almost a model independent estimator for the observed growth history of the universe and that is why most of the surveys e.g. the 2df , vvds , sdss , 6df , boss , as well as the wiggle - z galaxy survey provide the measurement for this estimator . in a recent paper @xcite compilation of the current measurements for @xmath86 has been given and we use those measurements for our purpose .    using these measurements , we calculate the posterior for our case , which is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 corresponds to parameters in our theory .",
    "@xmath89 is the prior probability distribution for different parameters . in our calculations",
    ", we fix the value of the spectral index @xmath90 which is the best fit value obtained by the planck @xcite .",
    "this is because , posterior is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath91 .",
    "we use gaussian prior for the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 , with their valuse as @xmath94 and @xmath95 from recent measurement by planck @xcite . for the model parameter @xmath96",
    ", we use a flat prior between @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "the likelihood function is defined as @xmath99 with @xmath100    covariance matrices for @xmath0 with non minimal coupling and for @xmath101 are constructed from the posterior . for non minimally coupled f(r ) with parameters as @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath79 it becomes + @xmath104 covariance matrix for @xmath101 with parameters as @xmath102 and @xmath79 becomes @xmath105    using these covariance matrices of non minimally coupled @xmath0 as well as for @xmath1cdm , we have reconstructed evolution of the growth factor @xmath2 and @xmath71 at @xmath106 and @xmath107 confidence level . this has been shown in figure 3 .",
    "one can see clearly that it is possible to distinguish the @xmath1cdm and the non - minimal @xmath0 model through the @xmath2 evolution both at @xmath106 and @xmath107 confidence level , whereas for the @xmath71 evolution , one can distinguish them at @xmath107 confidence level .",
    "we should stress the fact that two models have identical background evolution and can not be distinguished by any observation related to background cosmology .",
    "explaining late time acceleration is one of the most significant challenges for cosmologists today . modifying the einstein gravity at large cosmological scales like @xmath0 gravity models , is one interesting approach to explain such late time acceleration .",
    "coupling curvature with matter in @xmath0 gravity has been recently proposed which has the advantage , that the singularity that occurs in the standard @xmath0 gravity models may not occur in non minimally coupled @xmath0 .",
    "the background cosmology in such non - minimally coupled @xmath0 gravity has been studied .",
    "recently its implication on inhomogeneous universe has also been explored in @xcite .",
    "our goal is to extend further the work done in @xcite to investigate the possibility to distinguish such a non minimally coupled @xmath0 gravity model from the concordance @xmath1cdm model using the current measurements by different galaxy surveys . for this we do not assume any particular form for the function @xmath0 .",
    "we take a different approach in this investigation .",
    "the growth of matter overdensity in any modified gravity model depends both on the background expansion as well as the extra effects that arise solely due to the modification in the gravity action ( in this case it is the non minimal coupling between the curvature and matter ) . to study the effect of this non minimal coupling on the growth history and the subsequent deviation from the @xmath1cdm behavior , we fix the background evolution same as the that of the @xmath1cdm model thereby eliminating the effect due to the background evolution .",
    "now departure from the @xmath1cdm evolution is solely due to the modified equation for the growth evolution in the non - minimally coupled case .",
    "this is one crucial difference in approach from the investigation done in @xcite where a specific form for @xmath0 was assumed .",
    "subsequently we calculate the allowed behaviors for @xmath0 modification , that can give rise to the same background cosmology as in @xmath1cdm universe . reconstructing this form",
    ", we subsequently study the growth history and the @xmath108 normalization for such @xmath0 forms and compare them with @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "we use the measurements for @xmath3 ( which is mostly model independent ) from different galaxy surveys to reconstruct the form for growth factor @xmath2 and @xmath4 for both the non minimally coupled @xmath0 model as well as for @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "the results show that it is possible to distinguish these two models using the growth of matter over density , even if they have same background evolutions .",
    "this result is the important extension of the work done in @xcite to observationally distinguish the non minimally coupled @xmath0 gravity model from the concordance @xmath1cdm model .    we should mention that we have considered the simple form for the action as given in equation ( 1 )",
    "one can consider more general form like @xmath109 . in that case , if one considers the same background evolution as in @xmath1cdm , there will be effects on the growth history from the modified part of the pure gravity action ( @xmath110 ) as well as the effect due to the non minimal coupling between the matter and the curvature .",
    "one can then address two questions .",
    "firstly whether such model can be distinguished from the concordance @xmath1cdm using the current observational data . and also given a specific form for the pure gravity lagrangian @xmath110 , whether the non minimal @xmath0 model can be distinguished from the standard minimal @xmath0 model using the observational data .",
    "we shall address these issues in future .",
