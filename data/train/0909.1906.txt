    "low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are a common phenomenon , with a large fraction of all massive galaxies displaying some weak activity that is likely of non - stellar origin ( see , e.g. , ho 2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "understanding the demographics and physics of these objects is a necessary step towards the comprehension of super massive black hole activity in the local universe and its past evolution .",
    "low - ionization nuclear emission line regions ( liners ) , in particular , are a class of low - luminosity agns defined on the basis of their optical spectral line ratios @xcite and can be further divided into various subclasses according to their different properties ( chiaberge et al . 2005 ; gonzalez - martin et al .",
    "a fundamental question about these sources is the origin of their optical spectrum and multi - wavelength emission in general : it is not clear which fraction of the powering source is non - stellar and , if it is due to accretion , what is the regime of the accretion and the efficiency of the radiation conversion .",
    "it has been argued that the lack of x - ray variability ( e.g. , roberts et al .",
    "1999 ; komossa et al .",
    "1999 ; georgantopoulos et al . 2002 ; pellegrini et al .",
    "2003 ; ho 2008 ) , the non detection of broad fe k@xmath1 lines down to stringent limits @xcite , and the weakness or absence of the characteristic ` big blue bump ' in their optical / near - ultra - violet ( uv ) spectra , traditionally observed in seyferts @xcite , indicate that their engines may be intrinsically different from those of the more luminous agns , and could consist of radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) .",
    "however , x - ray observations of most of these sources have been sparse and not sensitive or not long enough to detect significant variability , except in m  81 , one of the closest and best studied _ bona fide _ ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) liners .",
    "furthermore , uv monitoring with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) of a sample of 17 liners has revealed the presence of bright and variable uv nuclei @xcite . by coupling these uv measurements with",
    "non simultaneous x - ray measurements with _ asca _ ,",
    "_ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _",
    ", @xcite has shown that the uv - to - x - ray flux ratios in liners are similar to those of much - more - luminous seyferts .",
    "thus , contrary to the common paradigm , rather than being qualitatively different from seyferts , liners may instead be ` scaled - down ' analogues of seyferts , with similar emission mechanisms operating in both classes .    while the arguments of @xcite are supported by accurate photometry , the uv and x - ray data of his sample were not simultaneous , with measurements often separated by years .",
    "liners exhibit variability , which , albeit not of very large amplitude ( by factors of up to a few in the uv on time scales of years ; @xcite ) , may undermine the results derived from non - simultaneous observations . in this paper , we approach this problem by obtaining , for the first time , simultaneous x - ray and uv data , along with x - ray variability information , for a small sample of liners . the nasa satellite is well suited to this task because it is a flexible and efficient facility for long simultaneous and accurate uv and x - ray monitoring .",
    "results of this work have been presented in preliminary form in romano et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    throughout this paper the uncertainties are given at 90% confidence levels for one interesting parameter ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the spectral indices are parameterized as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 ) is the flux density as a function of frequency @xmath7 ; we also use @xmath8 as the photon index , @xmath9 ( ph @xmath5 s@xmath6kev@xmath6 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe our sample , observations , analysis , and results obtained with the two  instruments ; in section  3 we construct the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) ; and in section  4 we discuss our findings .",
    "our sample consists of the brightest liners in the @xcite uv sample , but excluding m  87 , because of its prominent jet , which would dominate the uv emission at the resolution .",
    "the sample includes m  81 , ngc  3998 , ngc  4203 and ngc  4579 ( see table  [ liners : tab : specfits ] ) , which are all type-1 liners ( i.e. , with detected broad h@xmath1 components ) according to the classification by @xcite .",

    "the  archive already contained data for two of these sources , m  81 and ngc  4203 , which had been observed as  fill - in targets , and which we retrieved .",

    "the xrt data were processed with standard procedures ( xrtpipeline v0.11.6 ) , filtering and screening criteria by using ftools in the heasoft package ( v.6.4 ) . given the low count rate of the sources during the respective observing campaigns ( @xmath20 counts s@xmath6 ) , we only considered photon counting data ( pc ) , and further selected xrt grades 012 .",
    "no pile - up correction was required .",
    "the source events were extracted in circular regions centered on the source , with radii depending on the source intensity ( 1020 pixels , 1 pixel @xmath21 ) , while background events were extracted in source - free annular or circular regions , depending on the field .",

    "ancillary response files were generated with xrtmkarf , and account for different extraction regions , vignetting and point - spread function ( psf ) corrections .",
    "we used the v010 spectral redistribution matrices available in the calibration database maintained by heasarc .",
    "all spectra were rebinned with a minimum of 20 counts per energy bin to allow @xmath22 fitting within xspec ( v11.3.2 ) .",
    "we extracted xrt light curves from the same regions as for the spectra for source and background in the standard bands , 0.210kev ( total ) , 0.21kev ( soft , s ) and 110kev ( hard , h ) .",
    "for our analysis , we considered several time bins ranging from 120s to the typical orbit duration ( @xmath23s ) , and the minimum time bin was chosen to ensure that each light curve point would have at least 30 source - plus - background counts .",
    "the exposure requirements were that the bins be at least 50% exposed . in each case , the light curves were corrected for psf losses , i.e. , losses due to the extraction region geometry , and bad / hot pixels and columns falling within this region .    the host galaxy contribution in the xrt extraction region was evaluated using archival _",
    "_ images of these liners obtained with the longest exposures with acis - s .",
    "we evaluated the counts in the following regions : _",
    "r1 , an annulus with outer radius equal to the xrt extraction radius for each object and inner radius 4 , i.e. , the radius including 99% of the _ chandra _ psf ; _ ii ) _",
    "r2 , a circular region of 4radius ; _ iii ) _",
    "r3 , an annular region of radii 4and 45 .",
    "we assumed that r1 only contained host galaxy photons , r2 only active nucleus photons , while r3 was used to evaluate the galaxy counts in r2 assuming a constant host galaxy intensity profile .",
    "the measured counts in r3 were scaled to the area of r2 and added to the counts in r1 , thus obtaining an estimate of the host galaxy counts in the whole xrt extraction region . the host galaxy contribution to the x - ray emission of the four liners ranges from 6% ( ngc  3998 ) to 16% ( ngc  4203 ) , and was therefore subsequently ignored .            ) and hardness ratios ( i.e. , 1 - 10 kev to 0.2 - 1 kev flux ratios ) of ngc  4203 : 0.21kev ( top ) , 110kev ( middle ) light curves and hardness ratio curves ( bottom ) .",

    "although this exceeds the typical level of xrt photometric stability , which is about 10% ( as established on the basis of the flux stability of the standard source psr  0540 - 69 , cusumano , priv .",
    "comm . ) , we note that these occur at low flux levels , so that we can not assess their authenticity .",
    "therefore , we have considered only fluxes integrated over time scales no shorter than one orbit for further variability analysis .",
    "since the  satellite must re - settle on the target at every orbit , the target s location within the xrt field of view may change from orbit to orbit , and occasionally the source flux is greatly underestimated because of the vicinity of a detector dead column that affects the psf to various degrees .",
    "we have systematically checked our observations for this effect and have corrected for it ( see grupe et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , because of the low flux level of our sources , in many cases the psf reconstruction is not fully satisfactory and the corresponding flux points have been excluded from our variability analysis .    the orbit - averaged light curves of m  81 and ngc  3998 indicate variability . in figure 1c , 1d and 2b",
    "we show the flux and hardness - ratio time series of m  81 and ngc  3998 during the pointings when significant variations were observed .",

    "the variations in hard x - rays have a maximum amplitude of 30% in a time scale of 3 to 12 hours .",
    "the variability in soft x - rays is less pronounced , but well correlated with the hard x - rays , so that the hardness ratio is not significantly variable on these time scales .",
    "the soft and hard x - ray light curves of ngc  3998 on 29 april 2007 ( fig .",
    "2b ) are well correlated and have @xmath28 ( 13 d.o.f . ) and @xmath29 ( 13 d.o.f . ) with respect to the average flux , respectively , corresponding to constancy probabilities of @xmath27 or less .",
    "the largest variability amplitude of ngc  3998 is about 30% in both x - ray energy ranges , on a time scale of about 12 hours . neither ngc  4203 ( fig .",
    "3 ) nor ngc  4579 ( fig .",
    "4 ) vary significantly in flux or hardness ratio on the orbit or longer time scale .",
    "we have evaluated the variability of m  81 and ngc  3998 during the individual  pointings also through the excess variance parameter @xmath30 , defined as in nandra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and turner et al .",
    "( 1999 ; see also ptak et al .",
    "this never exceeds the value of 0.02 for both sources and for both energy ranges , and therefore it is almost one order of magnitude smaller than would be expected  based on the x - ray luminosities of these two liners  from the inverse proportionality relation between x - ray luminosity and variability established for seyfert galaxies by nandra et al .",

    "parameters meaningful . ]    for m  81 and ngc  3998 , which were observed on more than one epoch , with intervals larger than 1 day , we have evaluated the average flux at each epoch .",
    "the associated errors are the root mean squares of the averages , i.e. the standard deviations of the data points within the epoch , divided by the square root of their number .",
    "the corresponding light curves are shown in figures 1f and 2c for m  81 and ngc  3998 , respectively .",
    "the long term variations are conspicuous .",
    "the historical flux of m  81 decreases between 2005 april and 2006 june almost achromatically and then increases by 2007 february by a factor of 2 in the soft x - rays and slightly less in hard x - rays . the variability on year time scales is well correlated in the two bands , with no significant variations of the hardness ratio .",
    "the 110kev flux of ngc  3998 decreases by 30% in the nine days separating our two observations , while the 0.21kev flux decreases more slowly , implying a softening of the spectrum .",
    "indeed , the hardness ratio ( i.e. , the 1 - 10 kev to 0.2 - 1 kev flux ratio ) decreases significantly between the 2 epochs , varying from hr = @xmath31 to hr = @xmath32 .",
    "however , a spectral fit with a single power - law of each observation of this object does not show variability in the spectral parameters within the 90% confidence level .",
    "the mean xrt spectrum for each object was fit with a simple absorbed power - law model with free absorption and photon index .",
    "figure  5 shows the mean spectrum for each object in the sample , along with its best - fit model , while the fit results are reported in table  [ liners : tab : specfits ] .",
    "the spectra show no significant absorption features superimposed on the power - law continuum ; however , m  81 shows hints of an fe k@xmath1 emission line ( 6.4kev , fixed ) , with an equivalent width ew @xmath33ev .",
    "the f - test probability for this feature is @xmath34 , which corresponds to a 2.6-@xmath35 detection .",
    "ngc  4579 also shows a marginal ( f - test probability of @xmath36 or 2.1-@xmath35 ) fe k@xmath1 line at @xmath37kev , with ew @xmath38ev .",
    "the fluxes of these lines are @xmath39 and @xmath40 erg@xmath5s@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the equivalent widths are , within their large errors , broadly consistent with the values reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the uncertainties on the fitted hydrogen column densities ( table  [ liners : tab : specfits ] , column  4 ) are not small , all sources  except ngc  4203 , whose spectrum has a poor signal - to - noise ratio ",
    "show significant evidence for absorption in excess of the galactic one ( also reported in table  [ liners : tab : specfits ] ) .          the  ultraviolet - optical telescope ( uvot , * ?",
    "* ) observed the four targets with the filters @xmath41 ( 3465 ) @xmath42 ( 2600 ) , @xmath43 ( 2246 ) , @xmath44 ( 1928 ) simultaneously with the xrt .",
    "the filter choice was driven by the objective of maximizing the nuclear signal , which is dominant in the uv , while minimizing the stellar emission from the bulge populations of the target galaxies .",
    "for each object , after verifying that the uvot counts show no significant variability , we have coadded the images .",
    "the data analysis was performed using the uvotsource task included in the latest heasoft software .",
    "this task normally calculates the magnitude by means of aperture photometry within a circular region of @xmath45-radius , which includes more than 99% of the signal of a point source , and applies specific corrections due to the detector characteristics .",
    "since the adoption of this standard aperture often resulted in over - subtraction of the host - galaxy background , we used instead an aperture of @xmath46 radius , and applied the proper correction factor between a @xmath46-radius aperture to a @xmath45-radius aperture ( see below ) .",
    "because of its proximity ( 3.6mpc ) , the host galaxy of m  81 occupies most of the field - of - view of uvot , making it difficult to estimate the sky background to be subtracted from the nucleus and the galaxy light .",
    "the background was therefore computed from a @xmath47-radius circular region separated by @xmath48 from the nucleus . for uniformity ,",
    "the remaining three liners , albeit more distant , were treated in the same way .",
    "using archival hst images of these liners at 2500  and 3300   obtained with the high resolution channel ( hrc ) of the hst acs @xcite , we have evaluated the nuclear - point - source - subtracted host galaxy contribution for each object in a @xmath49-radius circular area centred on the nucleus , and have interpolated or extrapolated the uv host galaxy fluxes to the central wavelengths of the uvot @xmath41-band and uv filters , in order to subtract them from the observed fluxes .",
    "while the aperture - summed galaxy light is clearly detected in the hst images , the surface brightness is too low and the images are too oversampled to determine the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies on the scales of the apertures we use here .",
    "different galaxy profiles will require different corrections for psf losses outside the aperture .",
    "for the galaxy light subtraction , we have therefore considered two extreme cases : one in which the galaxy light is highly centrally concentrated , and one in which it has constant surface brightness . in the former scenario , the adoption of a @xmath49-radius for the uvot photometry results in a galaxy light loss similar to that suffered by the nuclear light , and therefore we first corrected the observed @xmath49-radius flux to a @xmath50-radius aperture , and then subtracted the galaxy flux evaluated from the hst images . in the latter case , where the light profile is flat , the galaxy light suffers no net psf losses in the uvot photometry , and we therefore first subtracted the hst galaxy flux from the total observed uvot flux and then applied the @xmath45-radius aperture correction to the remainder , which represents the point - source nuclear flux .",
    "the host galaxy contribution is dominant in the @xmath41 band ( it is generally comparable to the total flux observed by uvot ) and decreases with decreasing wavelength to the @xmath44 filter ( 1928 ) where it contributes , at most , 50% of the observed flux . the first galaxy - subtraction method described above predictably results in systematically larger nuclear fluxes than obtained with the second method . as also expected , the differences between the results of the two methods decrease as one goes to shorter wavelengths , where the galaxy light becomes less dominant .",
    "all uvot magnitudes have been converted into fluxes using the latest in - flight flux calibration factors and zero - points @xcite .",
    "the average observed fluxes with their statistical errors are reported in table [ liners : tab : uvotobs ] , where we also list the host galaxy fluxes measured in the hst images and converted to the wavelengths of the uvot filters , and the final nuclear fluxes obtained with the two subtraction methods described above .",
    "we combined the xrt spectra , corrected for the total hydrogen absorption ( table  [ liners : tab : specfits ] , col .  4 ) , and the uvot fluxes , corrected for their host galaxy backgrounds and dereddened using the @xmath51 extinction values compiled by @xcite from schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) , and adopting the galactic extinction curve of cardelli , clayton and mathis ( 1989 ) . these uv - to - x - ray spectral energy distributions ( sed )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the errors associated with the uvot nuclear fluxes are the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties associated with the observed uvot fluxes [ including the statistical error reported in table [ liners : tab : uvotobs ] and the systematic errors given in @xcite ] and the uncertainties of the galaxy hst measurements ( table [ liners : tab : uvotobs ] ) , increased by 5%  summed in quadrature  to take into account the uncertainty in the background subtraction on the hst images and the interpolation / extrapolation errors .",
    "whenever the galaxy flux evaluated from the hst images exceeded the total flux observed by uvot , we have used the total uncertainty to compute a 3-@xmath35 upper limit , which is indicated in the figure .    for comparison ,",
    "we have plotted also the previously measured uv - to - x - ray measurements [ see fig .  1 in @xcite ] and the mean seds of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars from @xcite , normalized to go through the geometric mean of the two nuclear fluxes at 1928  obtained with the two galaxy subtraction methods described above .",
    "note that the fluxes in this band suffer the least galaxy contamination , and therefore represent a solid lower limit to the intensity of the uv component .",
    "we have observed four bright liners with xrt and uvot onboard , to study their variability and their simultaneous uv - to - x - ray ratios , in an attempt to probe their emission mechanisms . in particular , high - luminosity agns  seyferts and qsos  are generally thought to be powered by geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disks .",
    "our new data can bring new insight to the question of whether low - luminosity agns  specifically liners  are simply lower - power analogues of seyferts and qsos , or are instead powered by some fundamentally distinct process , such as a riaf .    among our results",
    "is the first detection of x - ray variability in ngc  3998 , in a range of time scales from a few hours to days , with a @xmath030% amplitude .",
    "this is in contrast to earlier reports of no x - ray variability during bepposax and xmm - newton observations @xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference may be related to the larger sensitivity of xrt with respect to bepposax , and to xrt s higher scheduling flexibility , which allows for longer monitoring periods than possible with xmm - newton . @xcite have cited the absence of variability in ngc  3998 as evidence that the accretion is advection - dominated in this source .",
    "other workers ( ptak et al . 1998 ; ho 2008 ) have , in general , invoked non - variability in x - rays as an indicator of a riaf mode .",
    "our finding of significant short - term x - ray flux variations in a low - luminosity liner points , instead , to a similarity with whatever accretion mode is occurring in higher luminosity agns .",
    "however , the excess variance parameter of the ngc  3998 xrt light curves does not obey the inverse relation between x - ray luminosity and variability amplitude determined for high - luminosity agns ( nandra et al .",
    "1997 ; turner et al .",
    "1999 ) when this is extrapolated to the x - ray luminosity of ngc  3998 ( @xmath52 erg  s@xmath6 in 2 - 10 kev ) . instead , the variability amplitude is similar to that typical of seyferts of luminosity @xmath53 ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the range of validity of the relation may thus not extend to the low x - ray luminosities of the objects studied here .    a second liner in our sample , m  81",
    ", has already been shown to be x - ray variable on many time scales , from hours to years ( pellegrini et al .",
    "2000a ; la parola et al . 2004 ; page et al . 2004",
    "; markoff et al . 2008 ; iyomoto & makishima 2001 ; young et al . 2007 ) .",
    "our findings confirm this behaviour and set this object , along with ngc  3998 , as another x - ray - variable low - luminosity agn that is similar in this respect to high - luminosity agns .",
    "it has been suggested that the mechanisms active in this object are similar to those that cause the hard states in x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "our observation of spectral softening accompanying source brightening on a time scale of years is indeed reminiscent of the behavior exhibited , on a shorter time scale , by galactic sources .",
    "our xrt timing results on ngc  4203 and ngc  4579 are inconclusive .",
    "ngc  4203 exhibits no significant x - ray variability on any time scale , despite being , among the sources in @xcite , the one that varied with the largest amplitude in the uv .",
    "one reason may be that our monitoring period was limited , and hence we did not catch the stochastically occurring variations . alternatively , for this object the errors associated with orbit - averaged points are somewhat larger than those of m  81 and ngc  3998 , so that inter - orbit variations of amplitude similar to the inter - orbit variations in m  81 and ngc  3998 would not be detected at high significance . a prominent , variable fe k@xmath1 emission line has been detected by _",
    "asca _ and _ xmm - newton _ in ngc  4579 , and has given rise to various interpretations as to its origin from a standard accretion disk or a truncated disk @xcite .",
    "our weak xrt detection of the feature does not add significantly to this debate .",
    "our sources are all well detected in at least one uv filter ( fig .",
    "the uv - to - x - ray seds compare rather well with those reported by @xcite and obtained with non simultaneous uv and x - ray data .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the liners always lies about a factor of 3 to 10 above the normalized radio - loud quasar template , depending on the object and on the wavelength .",
    "the uv flux level has not changed dramatically in any of the sources ( fig .",
    "6 ) , although these are among the most uv - variable sources in the @xcite sample .",
    "we note , however , that the uvot fluxes are more uncertain than the hst measurements , owing to the galaxy subtraction and to the lower angular resolution and photometric accuracy of uvot .",
    "the xrt fluxes and spectra are also similar to the older ones , except for ngc  3998 , which xrt has detected in a state lower by @xmath040% than observed in 1999 and 2001 by bepposax and xmm - newton , respectively ( ptak et al .",
    "2004 , see also fig .",
    "we have evaluated the eddington ratios of our liners using the bolometric luminosities and the central black hole mass estimates compiled in @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosities were obtained from the normalized templates of radio - loud agns @xcite from 3465to 0.2kev and the observed x - ray spectrum from 0.2 to 10kev .",
    "in fact , the template may be a more reliable description of the spectrum at uv wavelengths ( considering that some of our uv points are upper limits ) , while at x - rays the template always underestimates the real flux ( see fig .  6 ) .",
    "in the radio - loud agn spectrum , the uv - to - x - ray flux dominates the sed , representing more than half of the total emission .",
    "moreover , considering that the _ intrinsic _ agn spectra probably lack the conspicuous _ observed _ bump centred at @xmath54 m , due to reprocessed radiation at shorter wavelengths @xcite , our computed bolometric luminosities may adequately represent the intrinsic luminosities after all .",
    "the eddington ratios , reported in table  [ liners : tab : specfits ] , are about 0.5dex higher than those computed by @xcite , who only included the uv luminosity , but are still low , as typical for liners .    by normalizing the agn templates to the uv emission , we note that the precisely determined xrt spectral slopes follow the average radio - loud agn shape , although , as noted , the spectral normalizations exceed the prediction by 0.5 to 1 order of magnitude ( fig .  6 ) .",

    "ngc  4203 , the less uv - luminous sources in our sample ( see table  1 ) , @xmath58 has an intermediate value , similar to those of seyferts , and the extrapolated @xmath13 is significantly flatter than the observed one and predicts x - ray luminosities that are 4 - 5 times higher than observed . as already noted by s06 based on their data alone , and further pointed out by maoz ( 2007 ) based on his non simultaneous uv and x - ray measurements , the s06 relation probably flattens at luminosities below @xmath59 erg  s@xmath6  hz@xmath6 .",
    "overall , our present simultaneous uv and x - ray photometry strengthens the case for a limiting value of @xmath13 below some critical luminosity typical of seyferts .    in summary , for the liners under study , the significant ultraviolet emission , the x - ray intraday variability , and the x - ray and multiwavelength spectral similarity with radio - loud agns all point to continuity and similarity with agns of higher luminosity .",
    "in view of this , it is not clear that distinct accretion and radiation mechanisms are required in the different luminosity regimes .",
    "further /xrt and uvot monitoring , or more optimally , new hst high angular resolution uv observations of larger samples , accompanied with xrt simultaneous coverage , could shed more light on these questions .",
    "we note , finally , that we can not exclude that , in these sources , the emission at x - ray and/or uv bands is partially due to a weak jet , some evidence of which has been reported for all of our four sources , either directly ( for m  81 , based on resolved radio structure detection and radio polarization ) or indirectly ( for ngc  3998 , ngc  4203 , ngc  4579 , based on a flat radio spectrum , a compact and variable radio core , and high brightness temperature ) from high resolution radio imaging ( bietenholz et al . 2000 ; bower et al .",

    "a jet has been proposed by ptak et al .",
    "( 2004 ) as possibly responsible for the multiwavelength emission . jetted high energy radiation in this liner would be compatible both with the rapid flux variations and with the frequency - dependent variability amplitude that we observe over 9 days ( fig .  2c ) , which is typical of non - thermal sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and which is dissimilar to the x - ray variability observed in seyferts [ usually of larger amplitude at softer energies , e.g. , @xcite ] and in weak - line radio - galaxies [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "however , it would be premature to draw a conclusion on the exact nature of the x - ray emitting process from the detection of spectral softening accompanying flux decrease between only two epochs in this individual liner .",
    "more work on the correlated radio and x - ray variability in liners  in both the observational and the theoretical directions  is necessary to assess the role of a jet in the multiwavelength emission ( see e.g. brenneman et al .",
