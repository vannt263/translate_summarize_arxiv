    "perhaps the most mysterious thing about black holes is their capacity to store and process information . already examining the behavior of black hole entropy @xcite in the classical limit ,",
    "one arrives at the following puzzle @xcite : according to the bekenstein formula , the black hole entropy scales as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the gravitational radius and @xmath3 is the planck length , which in terms of newton s coupling @xmath4 and the planck constant @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 .",
    "this expression diverges in the classical limit , if @xmath2 and @xmath4 are kept fixed .",
    "this is because @xmath7 in this limit .",
    "thus , a quantum physicist , to whom the classical physics is defined as a limit @xmath8 , concludes that the entropy ( and thus the information - storage capacity ) of a classical black hole of a finite mass is infinite . on the other hand , a classical observer would seem to have a very different perspective .",
    "a classical physicist knows that information can only be encoded in the black hole in features that are possible to re - arrange .",
    "but it is well known that classical black holes are essentially featureless .",
    "they are uniquely characterized by their mass , charge and the angular momentum .",
    "consequently , the classical observer would conclude that black holes should carry zero entropy .",
    "thus , it seems that the two observers must disagree on what happens in the @xmath9 limit .",
    "how can infinity and zero be reconciled ?",
    "the above puzzle , along many others , can only be resolved within a microscopic theory , which explicitly identifies the quantum degrees of freedom that act as carriers of the black hole information .",
    "we shall focus on a microscopic theory of this type offered in @xcite , in which the black hole is described as a composite multi - particle state of soft gravitons at a _ quantum critical _ point @xcite .",
    "this system can approximately be described as a bose - einstein condensate ( or a coherent state ) of gravitons of characteristic wavelength @xmath10 and occupation number @xmath11 . according to this picture , the microscopic carriers of black hole entropy and information are collective excitations of the bogolyubov - type @xcite .",
    "the remarkable property of these modes is that around the critical point they become nearly gapless and decouple from the rest of the modes in the @xmath12 limit .",
    "hence , if a system has @xmath0 gapless bogolyubov modes , there are expected to exist @xmath13 nearly - degenerate quantum states that can be labeled by the occupation numbers of these modes .",
    "these states are crowded within a @xmath14 energy gap .",
    "correspondingly , the entropy should scale as @xmath15 .",
    "such a behavior uncovers a very peculiar nature of black hole information storage and in particular addresses the above puzzle . in the classical limit @xmath16 and entropy is indeed infinite , but the energy gap closes to zero . despite the fact that the number of quantum states located within this gap diverges , the required time for resolving their differences also becomes infinite .",
    "this time - delay reconciles the views of the two observers .",
    "the classical black hole appears as featureless for any finite interval of the observation time .    in the present paper",
    "we shall focus our attention on improving the understanding of the relation between quantum criticality and physics of information - processing . since , according to the black hole @xmath0-portrait the underlying fundamental ingredient of black hole information - processing is a self - sustained quantum criticality of the cold graviton gas , the natural question to ask is : how important is the precise nature of the constituent bosons ?",
    "of course , for recovering the standard gravitational properties of the system , such as the emergence of the einsteinian metric in a mean field description , the spin-2 nature of the constituents is crucial .",
    "however , one may suspect that the information - processing features that originate from the fact of criticality , may not be so sensitive to the precise nature of the constituents .",
    "if this is true , then a wide class of critical systems must share some of the black hole information - processing abilities .",
    "this would be a very important conclusion because of the following reasons .",
    "first , it would enable us to study black hole properties on much simpler systems , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "secondly , it would open up a possibility of implementing the black hole information - processing methods in table - top experiments .",
    "indeed , it was noticed already in @xcite that the simplest prototype models of attractive bose - einstein condensates exhibit some striking similarities with the black hole quantum portrait .",
    "for example , the cost of the information - storage per qubit is by a factor of @xmath17 cheaper relative to the energy - cost exhibited by usual ( non - critical ) quantum systems . in the latter systems , for the same amount of information storage , one typically pays the energy price of the inverse size of the system , @xmath18 .",
    "also , the degeneracy of states within the @xmath17 energy gap increases with @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , it was shown that a sharp increase of one - particle entanglement takes place near the critical point @xcite and the scrambling of information becomes maximally - efficient @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent evolution of the critical condensate uncovers a scaling solution in which the condensate is stuck at the critical point throughout the collapse @xcite .",
    "this is the behavior that one would expect if the microscopic foundation of hawking radiation were through the collapse and quantum depletion of the condensate .-",
    "matrix that the above multi - particle picture represents the correct microscopic description of black hole physics .",
    "indeed , the @xmath19 scattering @xmath20-matrix element of two trans - planckian gravitons into @xmath0 soft ones reproduces an entropy suppression factor @xmath21 when the number @xmath0 is given by the quantum critical value @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in @xcite in a different approach . for other aspects and related work ,",
    "see @xcite . ]    in the present paper we would like to take one more step in understanding the universal role of quantum criticality for information - processing .",
    "to this end , we invent a new method for deriving the effective low - energy theory of modes near the critical point .",
    "as we shall see , the resulting effective theory indeed describes nearly - gapless modes with @xmath17-suppressed couplings .",
    "this form immediately reveals the key features of information storage , such as the low energy cost and the long timescale for retrieval as well as the high speed of information scrambling in the over - critical unstable phase .",
    "in our approach we formulate an effective description of quantum criticality in the isomorphic language of a pseudo - goldstone phenomenon in a @xmath22-sigma - model .",
    "the global @xmath22-symmetry of the sigma model corresponds to a continuous unitary transformation among the creation and annihilation operators of the bosons with different momenta @xmath23 .",
    "this identification allows us to map the hamiltonian of the bose - gas onto a potential of the @xmath22-sigma model . in this way , the problem of diagonalization of the hamiltonian becomes isomorphic to finding the symmetry breaking patterns in the sigma model .",
    "the latter is achieved by the straightforward minimization of the potential .",
    "the resulting pattern determines the spectrum of pseudo - goldstone excitations .",
    "the quantum critical points of the bose - gas correspond to the transitions between the different symmetry breaking patterns in the sigma model , where some goldstone modes become gapless .",
    "we show that this transition takes place when the particle number @xmath0 and the strength of the attractive interaction @xmath24 exactly balance each other , @xmath25 .",
    "this approach allows to derive an effective hamiltonian of the gapless excitations in form of the potential energy part of the goldstone chiral lagrangian .",
    "this form reveals that near the critical point the goldstones represent gapless excitations with @xmath17-suppressed self - interactions , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the goldstone number operator .",
    "analyzing the resulting effective theory , we observe a striking connection with anticipated features of black hole information processing .",
    "namely , the energy cost per information qubit goes to zero as a power of @xmath17 and correspondingly near the critical point the time for information retrieval increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the number of states within the collapsed energy gap increases either as a power law or exponentially with @xmath0 depending on the nature of the attractive coupling . for a non - derivative self interaction",
    "the increase follows a power law , whereas for a gravity - type derivatively - coupled case the degeneracy is increasing exponentially with @xmath0 .    on the other hand",
    ", the instability of the system in the over - critical regime implies a positive lyapunov exponent which , as shown in @xcite , is the engine for scrambling of information .",
    "the logarithmic scaling of the scrambling time for black holes was originally conjectured in @xcite .",
    "the observation that critical bose - einstein systems are fast scramblers provides the microscopic understanding of this phenomenon in terms of a lyapunov exponent and the high density of states near the quantum critical point @xcite .    in summary , the effective theory of information at quantum critical point developed in the present paper confirms , in accordance with @xcite , that critical multi - boson systems are indeed efficient storers and processors of information .",
    "finally , in identifying the information carriers for black hole entropy , we distinguish two distinct sources of quantum degeneracy .",
    "since degenerate states are labeled by occupation numbers of gapless goldstone modes , we can create degenerate states either by increasing the occupation numbers of a small subset of goldstone modes , or by diversifying the population among many different goldstone modes , while keeping individual occupation numbers small .",
    "the crucial difference among the two types of states is that the information stored in un - diversified large occupation numbers can in principle be resolved in interference experiments even in the classical limit .",
    "irrespectively whether contributions from such states must be counted into black hole entropy , their existence gives a very interesting possibility of detecting the quantum sub - structure in macroscopic experiments .",
    "we start with the system that was used in @xcite as the simplest prototype model for exploring the connection between black hole information processing and quantum criticality . it is a gas of cold bosons with a delta - function - type attractive interaction .",
    "such systems are well known and have in particular been studied in the context of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian of the following form , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the @xmath31-dimensional volume and @xmath32 is the @xmath31-dimensional wave - number vector .",
    "@xmath33 are creation and annihilation operators of bosons of momentum @xmath34 .",
    "they satisfy the usual commutation relation @xmath35 = \\delta_{\\vec{k}\\vec{k'}}$ ] .",
    "@xmath36 is the coupling . rescaling the hamiltonian , we can write @xmath37 . introducing a notation @xmath38 and taking @xmath39 we arrive at the following hamiltonian ,",
    "@xmath40 we restrict ourselves to three levels , @xmath41 .",
    "legitimacy of this approximation shall be justified later .",
    "let us define a triplet operator @xmath42 .",
    "correspondingly , we define the number operators @xmath43 .",
    "we treat the operator @xmath44 as a triplet under a global symmetry group @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a unitary transformation matrix which keeps invariant the total number operator , @xmath48 thus , in any state with non - zero particle occupation number , @xmath49 the @xmath45-symmetry is spontaneously broken and the order parameter of breaking is @xmath0 .",
    "this fact allows us to map the dynamics of the quantum phase transition in a bose - einstein condensate described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) onto the pseudo - goldstone phenomenon in an @xmath45 sigma model .",
    "the hamiltonian in terms of the triplet @xmath44 can be written as @xmath50 where , @xmath51 is the @xmath45-invariant part of the hamiltonian and has the following form , @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the lagrange multiplier that fixes the total particle number .",
    "let us first investigate the ground - state of the @xmath45-symmetric hamiltonian .",
    "minimization with respect to @xmath54 gives the following equations , @xmath55 and @xmath56 the vacuum is achieved at @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath45-symmetry is spontaneously broken down to @xmath59 and there is a doublet of nambu - goldstone bosons can thus be understood as the breaking of @xmath60 on the hilbert space and gives rise to @xmath61 goldstone modes . ] .",
    "for example , choosing the vacuum at @xmath62 and ignoring @xmath63-corrections to the zero mode occupation , the goldstone doublet is @xmath64 .",
    "the existence of the goldstone boson is the manifestation of the indifference of the system with respect to redistributing occupation numbers among the different levels .",
    "now , the addition of the first three terms in ( [ hamilton1 ] ) breaks the @xmath45 symmetry explicitly and lifts the vacuum degeneracy .",
    "let us investigate the effect of these terms on the state @xmath65 .",
    "notice , this vev continues to be the extremum of the hamiltonian even after the addition of the explicit - breaking terms , but the value of @xmath53 is now shifted to @xmath66 .",
    "the would - be goldstone modes now acquire a non - trivial mass - matrix , @xmath67 this matrix is diagonalized by states @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with eigenvalues @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively . in this basis the hamiltonian becomes , @xmath72 thus , a would be goldstone doublet is now split into a light mode and its heavy mode partner . since the explicit breaking terms leave unbroken the @xmath73 subgroup of @xmath45 , corresponding to the generator @xmath74 , the mass eigenstates @xmath75 and @xmath76 are also @xmath73-charge eigenstates .",
    "they carry charges equal to @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively . in the usual language , the charge @xmath79 is a momentum operator .",
    "let us at this point highlight the relation between the goldstone modes @xmath75 and @xmath76 and the usual bogolyubov eigenmodes of the mass matrix .",
    "the latter are obtained by diagonalizing the mass matrix through a canonical transformation ; in our setup , they are given by @xmath80 with @xmath81 in this description , the hamiltonian has two degenerate eigenvalues @xmath82 the modes @xmath75 and @xmath76 relate to the bogolyubov modes through @xmath83 the goldstone mode thus encodes a light direction in configuration space , reachable through occupying both bogolyubov modes simultaneously .",
    "note that a state with bogolyubov occupation number of @xmath63 corresponds to a goldstone configuration with @xmath84 , which is responsible for the @xmath85-difference in the eigenvalues .",
    "the heavy partner , on the other hand , corresponds to a heavy multi - particle direction in configuration space , reachable through populating either one of the bogolyubov modes with @xmath86 particles . in turn",
    ", this explains the @xmath87-independence of the second eigenvalue of .    for @xmath88 one of the pseudo - goldstone bosons becomes tachyonic and the vacuum is destabilized .",
    "the physics of this instability is that for @xmath89 the @xmath59 preserving vacuum is no longer energetically favorable and the system flows towards the new ground - state .",
    "this new ground - state can be found by minimizing the full hamiltonian , ( [ hamilton1 ] ) . in order to minimize this hamiltonian ,",
    "let us set @xmath90 .",
    "the only phase - dependent term in the hamiltonian is the second term in ( [ hamilton1 ] ) , which takes the form @xmath91 since there is no other conflicting phase - dependent term in the energy , in the minimum we will have @xmath92 . we can thus set without any loss of generality , @xmath93 another simplifying observation is that in the extremum @xmath94 and @xmath95 must be equal .",
    "this can be seen by extremizing the hamiltonian with respect to @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 @xmath97 which show that @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be non - zero only together .",
    "moreover they must be equal , since they satisfy the same equation , with only one positive root .",
    "this can be seen by multiplying ( [ min1 ] ) and ( [ min2 ] ) by @xmath94 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "the resulting quadratic equations are identical , @xmath99 @xmath100 and have only one positive root .",
    "thus , without any loss of generality we can minimize the hamiltonian for the configuration @xmath101 , which gives @xmath102 since @xmath103 is positive definite , for @xmath104 , the minimum is achieved at @xmath105 . for @xmath89 , the minimum is at @xmath106 not surprisingly , this corresponds to the first fourier modes of the bright soliton solution to the gross - pitaevskii equation in the overcritical regime @xcite .",
    "the energy of the ground - state is given by @xmath107 where the first term only exists for @xmath89 .",
    "we can now understand the critical phenomenon in terms of this goldstone - mode .",
    "the large occupation number serves as an order parameter for a spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath45-symmetry .",
    "this symmetry corresponds to redistribution of the particle occupation numbers between the different momentum states , without changing their total number .",
    "this symmetry is only approximate , and normally the would - be goldstone mode has the mass of the order of the first momentum level ( that is order one in our units ) .",
    "however , the phase transition corresponds to the point where the particle number distribution changes .",
    "this necessarily implies that the corresponding pseudo - goldstone mode must become massless at this point .    notice that since @xmath103 parameterizes the occupation number of ( pseudo-)goldstones , @xmath108 , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonx ] ) essentially represents the effective action for this mode , @xmath109 thus , the mass of the pseudo - goldstone is given by @xmath110 and the self - coupling is given by @xmath111 . at the critical point ,",
    "the goldstone mass term vanishes and the theory is described by a gapless mode with a self - interaction strength given by @xmath112 , @xmath113    of course , the phenomena uncovered in the goldstone formulation are in one - to - one correspondence to those that are seen in a mean - field and bogolyubov description of the model .",
    "in fact , as hinted before , the minima of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "correspond to the @xmath114 modes of the solutions to the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation : for @xmath115 we found the homogenous condensate , while the solution for @xmath89 corresponds to a localized bright soliton .     at various values of @xmath0 , using the parametrization @xmath116 .",

    "in particular , the ground state at the critical point is characterized by strong entanglement and is therefore not well described by a mean field .",
    "this , however , will not alter our conclusion on state - counting and information processing to be performed in the following sections .",
    "we reemphasize that in the goldstone language , the critical point amounts to destabilization of the @xmath59-invariant vacuum . with the pseudo - goldstone method we have traded the diagonalization of the hamiltonian with the minimization procedure .",
    "substituting the small deformations of the order parameter by the goldstone mode allowed us to derive the effective action for the latter .",
    "this is similar to deriving an effective hamiltonian of a phonon field in a background external magnetic field , which breaks the rotational symmetry of a ferromagnet .",
    "the analogous role in our treatment is assumed by the terms in the hamiltonian that explicitly break @xmath45-symmetry .- color qcd . in this case",

    "we conclude this section by pointing out that one can continue an analytic treatment of the system into the solitonic regime by performing an @xmath103-dependent canonical rotation on the creation and annihilation operators @xmath128 .",

    ", we immediately see that the translation generator @xmath138 , which commutes exactly with the hamiltonian for all @xmath103 , does no longer annihilate the groundstate .",
    "the generator that redistributes particle numbers , on the other hand , only commutes with @xmath139 at the critical point .",

    "their number is @xmath213 .",
    "this number sets the number of legitimate pseudo - goldstone modes",
    ". however , not all the massless - pseudo - goldstone modes contribute the same weight into the entropy .",
    "this is because their self - couplings have different strengths .",
    "hence exciting different pseudo - goldstone species will contribute into the hamiltonian differently . in order to identify which species give the maximal contribution into the entropy of the system , let us consider the effective hamiltonian for the pseudo - goldstone modes .",
    "it has the following form ( we ignore numerical factors of order one ) , @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the occupation number of pseudo - goldstone of a given momentum number @xmath32 . at the critical point ,",
    "the mass terms vanish and the hamiltonian is given by the quartic couplings , @xmath216 we can obtain a lower bound for the number of states in the allowed range by looking for the @xmath217 that provides the maximal contribution to the partition sum . we need to take into account two competing effects : the larger @xmath218 , the more modes , and thus states , are supplied . on the other hand , the energy cost of a given mode grows with @xmath218 , thereby limiting the maximum allowed occupation .",
    "moreover , we pay a penalty for occupying modes more than once as seen from the quadratic dependence of on @xmath219 .",
    "a conservative lower bound is thus obtained by summing over all states in a shell around the limiting momentum @xmath220 which allows for all goldstone modes of given wavenumber to be occupied exactly once .",
    "lower momenta will yield subdominant contributions due to the reduced number of modes and the related penalty for higher occupation ; higher momentum modes , on the other hand , are too costly to excite .",
    "we obtain the contribution , @xmath221 where we ignored a possible cancellation from the cross - couplings .",
    "the factor @xmath222 comes from the total number of modes .",
    "the maximal contribution to the entropy will come from the species with largest @xmath217 , subject to the condition @xmath223 .",
    "taking into the account that @xmath204 , and assuming @xmath224 , we obtain @xmath225 for the limiting momentum and the corresponding number of modes . we get the following contribution to the entropy from the pseudo - goldstone species , @xmath226 note that we have also evaluated the full partition sum numerically and thereby verified that the wavenumbers with @xmath227 provide the dominant contributions .",
    "if we take into the account the effect of cross - couplings , ignoring possible `` flat directions '' on which the different contributions cancel , we get a more conservative lower bound on the entropy .",
    "the number of cross - couplings for a given momentum level @xmath168 scales as the number of corresponding pseudo - goldstones squared , @xmath228 .",
    "then , equation ( [ variation ] ) changes to @xmath229 this lowers the allowed number of simultaneously - excitable goldstones to @xmath230    independently , we observe the general message that the derivative self - coupling of bosons leads to a dramatic increase of pseudo - goldstone modes .",
    "we finally wish to address the following question . which of the large number of degenerate states are good candidates for carrying the bekenstein - type entropy of a black hole ? in order to answer this question , we shall distinguish two categories of states .",
    "_ 1 ) _ the first category represents states that _ can not _ be resolved semi - classically in any macroscopic measurement .",
    "that is , the quantum information stored in such states becomes unreadable in the infinite-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we shall refer to this category of states as type-@xmath231 .",
    "_ 2 ) _ the second category are states that can be resolved in some macroscopic interference experiments .",
    "that is , the quantum information stored in such states can be read out even for @xmath232 .",
    "we shall correspondingly refer to these states as type-@xmath233 .",
    "what distinguishes these two categories of states microscopically ?",
    "in our picture the states of both categories can be labeled by the occupation numbers of some nearly - gapless quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "as discussed above , these information - carriers can be described as bogolyubov and/or goldstone degrees of freedom .",
    "what distinguishes the two category of states is the scaling behavior of information - carrier occupation numbers in large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the type-@xmath231 category of states refers to those in which the relative occupation number of gapless degrees of freedom vanishes in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "that is , none of these information - carrier degrees of freedom are macroscopically occupied .",
    "correspondingly , the type-@xmath231 states can not be resolved in any macroscopic measurements .    for type-@xmath233 states ,",
    "some of the goldstone modes can be macroscopically occupied with an occupation number that scales as a non - vanishing fraction of @xmath0 in the @xmath119 limit .",
    "such states can be resolved in macroscopic interference experiments , we connect to the classical limit by performing the counting of states in a coherent state basis . in this basis",
    ", one can immediately write down the matrix elements that describe macroscopic interference experiments capable of resolving differences between the different type-@xmath233 states . ] .",
    "this discussion is more relevant for the derivatively - coupled model ( [ hderivative ] ) , since it exhibits a large diversity of goldstone modes .",
    "however , to keep the discussion as simple as possible , we shall here consider only the model ( [ hnonderivative ] ) .",
    "therein , let us now exemplify which states can be attributed to the type - a and type - b categories .    as discussed at the end of section [ sec : critgs ] , at the critical point , two gapless modes emerge .",
    "the appearance of these states is a direct consequence of quantum criticality .",
    "they come from those components of the @xmath59-doublet pseudo - goldstone that are not affected by the explicit breaking .",
    "one of them is only an approximate goldstone , corresponding to one linear superposition of the off - diagonal generators from the quotient @xmath234 .",
    "this goldstone is massless only near the critical point .",
    "in contrast , the other degree of freedom is an exact goldstone corresponding to the spontaneously broken @xmath73-generator @xmath235 of @xmath45 .",
    "this goldstone is massless everywhere at and beyond the critical point .",
    "a counting of states in the goldstone as well as in the bogolyubov language suggests that the number of independent states below the @xmath17 energy gap near the critical point scales at least as @xmath236 .",
    "however , the total number of almost orthogonal states with expectation value of energy below the same gap becomes larger if we also include coherent states in the counting ( see appendix ) .",
    "this is because the coherent states are neither energy nor number eigenstates and involve superpositions of arbitrary energetic modes with arbitrarily large occupation numbers .",
    "correspondingly , they explore a much bigger fraction of the hilbert space than the states constructed out of a finite number of energy or number eigenstates .",
    "only the states with vanishing fractions of goldstone ( or bogolyubov ) occupation numbers belong to the type-@xmath231 category . on the other hand ,",
    "states with macroscopic occupation numbers of goldstones , such as coherent states , belong to the type-@xmath233 category .",
    "the latter states can be resolved in macroscopic measurements , even in @xmath232 limit .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that the coherent states are  classical \" .",
    "given the fact that interference experiments with black holes have never been performed , both of these categories are very interesting , since they both reveal the internal microscopic structure of black holes .",
    "however , the question is whether both of the types of states should be counted as carriers of black hole bekenstein entropy .",
    "_ should bekenstein entropy originate exclusively from the quantum states with small - occupation numbers of many species of gapless bogolyubov / goldstone degrees of freedom , or should the states with large occupation numbers of few species also count ? _    for now , we shall keep both options open .",
    "the purpose of this paper was to emphasize the fundamental role of quantum criticality for information - processing in many - body systems and to establish this phenomenon as a viable candidate for the underlying mechanism for black hole information - processing , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we showed that the simplest multi - particle systems with critical behavior capture qualitative features of information - processing that is expected for black holes , such as the low energy cost of information storage , large degeneracy of states and scrambling of information .    in order to visualize the nature of the critical phase transition in the language of spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    ", we developed a new description in which we mapped the quantum phase transition in attractive bose - gas on a goldstone phenomenon in a sigma model .",
    "the two systems represent two realizations of one and same unitary symmetry that rotates different momentum modes into each other .",
    "this symmetry is broken both spontaneously as well as explicitly , but the explicit breaking vanishes , up to @xmath17 effects , at the critical point , resulting onto the gapless pseudo - goldstone modes .",
    "this mapping allows us to establish a correspondence between the quantum criticality in bose - einstein systems and the change of symmetry breaking pattern in a sigma - model .",
    "correspondingly , we map the entropy - carrying ( nearly)gapless bogolyubov modes of the bose - gas on the ( nearly)gapless goldstone modes of the sigma model",
    ". this mapping also allows to formulate , up to @xmath17-corrections , an effective theory of nearly gapless modes in the regime in which occupation numbers are large .",
    "our findings , within the validity - domain of the description , confirm the results of previous studies @xcite and shed light on the criticality phenomenon from a novel angle .",
    "our studies indicate that the key information - processing properties of black holes are shared by a larger class of the critical systems , including the ones that can be designed in table - top labs .",
    "this opens up a possibility of `` borrowing '' black hole information processing abilities for implementing them in the laboratory systems .",
    "since our findings suggest that critical instability is the key for efficient information processing , it would be interesting to find out , by generalizing our approach , whether other unstable systems , for example , the ones with parametric resonance instabilities @xcite and large classical statistical fluctuations , studied in @xcite , also exhibit some analogous properties of information scrambling and processing .",

    "in order to highlight the difference between the above two types of states , it is useful to perform the state - counting in a coherent - state basis . we shall do this on the simplest example of system ( [ hamilton ] ) .",
    "generalization to the derivatively - coupled case is straightforward .",
    "the reason for choosing a coherent - state basis is due to its usefulness for establishing the contact with the classical limit .",
    "since the characteristic property of type-@xmath233 states is precisely their distinguishability in the classical limit , the coherent state picture is more convenient for their description . in particular , in this basis we can immediately write down the matrix elements that describe macroscopic interference experiments capable of resolving differences between the different type-@xmath233 states .",
    "let us evaluate the expectation value of the three - level hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) over a set of coherent states with the fixed total average number @xmath0 .",
    "these states can be labeled by parameter @xmath103 and the three phases @xmath237 respectively .",
    "we shall denote them by @xmath238 .",
    "each such state represents a tensor product @xmath239 of three coherent states , one per each momentum level @xmath152 . these have the following generic form , @xmath240 where @xmath241 .",
    "the mean occupation numbers satisfy @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "the integers @xmath244 label the fock space occupation numbers for each of the three levels . taking the expectation value of the hamiltonian and imposing the minimum constraint on the phases ( [ phaseconstraint ] ) , we arrive ( not surprisingly ) at the effective hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonx ] ) .",
    "obviously , we should only count the coherent states that form an almost - orthogonal set .",
    "the scalar product of the two distinct coherent states @xmath245 and @xmath246 is , @xmath247 thus , the suppression of the matrix element between the two coherent states comes from the two sources : the difference in occupation numbers and difference in phases",
    ".    we shall only be interested in the set of states over which the expectation value of the hamiltonian stays within @xmath14 gap .",
    "for such states the value of @xmath103 is bounded from above by @xmath248 .",
    "thus , without taking into the account the variation of phases , we have maximum @xmath249 coherent states that are orthogonal due to difference in the occupation number @xmath103 . in addition",
    ", there is a degeneracy due to variation of the phases . for a fixed @xmath103",
    ", we can perform the two independent variations of phases that preserve the minimum constraint ( [ phaseconstraint ] ) . however , the step of the variation of each independent phase in coherent state counting must be larger than its quantum uncertainty . from the properties of the coherent states",
    "the phases satisfy the quantum uncertainty @xmath250 .",
    "thus , the step in variation of each phase can not be smaller than this uncertainty .    for the clarity of counting we should distinguish variation of the different phases .",
    "notice that since the phases are constrained by the minimum condition ( [ phaseconstraint ] ) , there are only two independent phase degrees of freedom , which can be chosen as @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "the states of interest can thus be labeled as @xmath253 .",
    "let us first fix the phase @xmath251 and only vary the phase @xmath254 .",
    "the quantum uncertainly in this phase is @xmath255 and therefore for given @xmath103 there are of order @xmath256 independent coherent states that are orthogonal to each other . this set of states is obtained by variation of the relative phase @xmath254 with the elementary step bounded from below by the minimal quantum uncertainty @xmath257 . now summing over different values of @xmath103 over an interval @xmath258",
    ", we get that , for fixed @xmath251 , the total number of orthogonal coherent states crowded within the @xmath17 energy gap , is given by @xmath259 .",
    "the story with the @xmath251 phase is somewhat different .",
    "this phase is a goldstone boson corresponding to the generator @xmath260 , which is spontaneously broken already in the under - critical regime @xmath261 .",
    "correspondingly , the coherent states that are orthogonal due to variation of @xmath251 exist irrespective of criticality .",
    "the number of such orthogonal states for arbitrary value of @xmath103 is @xmath262 .",
    "of course , they continue to contribute into the degeneracy also at the critical point , but this extra degeneracy has nothing to do with quantum criticality .",
