    "with their ability to penetrate large columns of gas and dust , observations at both x - ray and infrared wavelengths are complementary in the study of active galactic nuclei ( hereafter , agns ) . while x - rays provide a largely uncontaminated view of the primary emission process , measures of infrared emission yield detailed information about the levels of dust and on - going star - formation surrounding agns .",
    "consequently , by combining results from both x - ray and infrared observations , we can address some of the key remaining questions concerning agns and their to links galaxy evolution , such as ( 1 ) the properties of the obscuring agn dusty torus and how it has evolved with time , ( 2 ) the relative ratio between galaxy and black hole growth ( i.e. , star - formation and agn activity ) over cosmic time and ( 3 ) the numbers of x - ray weak , infrared bright compton - thick agns in the universe .    here",
    ", we provide a summary of our recently published investigation into the mid to far - infrared ( mir [ 5 - 30  @xmath1 ] and fir [ 30 - 300  @xmath1 ] , respectively ) properties of x - ray detected agns out to @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) . as part of this study , we develop new mir / fir diagnostics to identify those systems dominated by agn activity and derive their total infrared output ( across 8 - 1000  @xmath1 ; hereafter , @xmath6 ) from their 24  @xmath7 and 70  @xmath1 flux densities ( hereafter , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ) .",
    "we then use these diagnostics to explore how the infrared properties of x - ray detected agns vary as a function of redshift and intrinsic power ( assumed to correlate with x - ray luminosity , @xmath10 ) . in doing so , we find that the average infrared to x - ray luminosity ratio ( @xmath11 ) of moderate luminosity agns has evolved strongly over cosmic time .",
    "finally , we explore how these diagnostics will be combined with the results from planned _ herschel _ surveys to further enhance our understanding of agns and their role in galaxy evolution .",

    "we ensure that the x - ray properties of this local sample are representative of our main , high redshift sample of agns ( i.e. @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; @xcite ) . using the 6.2 um pah emission feature as an indicator of star formation activity @xcite ,",

    "each track in these plots is derived from an individual agn s infrared sed , classified in terms of their dominant source of infrared emission ( i.e. , agn or starburst ) . at all redshifts considered",
    ", a given @xmath9 flux density ( in this case , 1  mjy ) corresponds to a significantly smaller range in @xmath6 than could be derived from @xmath8 alone .",
    "for example , estimates of @xmath6 for a @xmath18 source based solely on @xmath8 can span over an order of magnitude ( i.e. , a factor of @xmath3 ) . on the other hand , an equivalent source measured solely at 70  @xmath1 would have its @xmath6 constrained to within a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "we note these quoted ranges of @xmath6 are derived from our full sample of low redshift agns , irrespective of infrared classification ( i.e. , agn or starburst - dominated ) .    by classifying the local x - ray detected agns in terms of their dominant source of infrared emission , we can investigate whether the @xmath9/@xmath8 flux ratio can be used to identify agn - dominated systems .",
    "this seems plausible based on evidence that , compared to inactive galaxies , agns show an excess of mir emission produced by dust heated by the intense radiation field of the central engine @xcite . by exploiting the well constrained seds of our local agn sample , we find that this excess results in agn - dominated systems having lower @xmath9/@xmath8 ratios compared to their starburst - dominated counterparts , with an agn / starburst division around @xmath9/@xmath20 .",

    "by applying the above mir / fir diagnostics to the high redshift , x - ray detected agns in the 1  ms chandra deep field south ( hereafter , cdf - s ) , we explore how the infrared properties of x - ray detected agns vary as a function of redshift and intrinsic power ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosities and absorbing column densities of the cdf - s agns were taken from @xcite .",
    "the observed 24  @xmath30 and 70  @xmath1 flux densities of the cdf - s agns were obtained from the fidel and goods _ spitzer _ legacy surveys . however , as only @xmath3110% of the x - ray agns in this field are formally detected at 70  @xmath1 , we relied on stacking analysis to gain insight into their average infrared properties .      in fig .",
    "2 we plot the @xmath11 luminosity ratios of the x - ray agns as a function of redshift and separated in terms of @xmath32 . we include in this plot results derived from both our local ( i.e. , _ swift_-bat ) and high redshift ( i.e. , cdf - s ) samples of x - ray detected agns .",
    "it is clear from this plot that high redshift , moderate x - ray luminosity agns ( i.e. , defined here as @xmath33 ) are significantly more _ infrared _ luminous ( per unit accretion power output ) than their low redshift counterparts .",
    "indeed , we note a factor of @xmath34 increase in the @xmath11 luminosity ratios between moderate @xmath10 agns at @xmath35 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , in the same redshift interval we measure no significant change in the @xmath11 luminosity ratios of the most x - ray luminous agns in our sample ( i.e. , with @xmath36 ) .",
    "clearly , results based solely on stacking analysis can be subject to significant systematic uncertainties , not least from the possibility that stacked fluxes can be dominated by a small number of bright sources lying just below the detection threshold of the survey . to check whether such bright , yet undetected , sources are responsible for the observed increase in the @xmath11 luminosity ratios , we also present in fig .",
    "2 points derived from the 24  @xmath1 flux densities of the individual x - ray agns . although measures of @xmath6 derived from @xmath8 alone are subject to significant systematic uncertainties ( as outlines above ) , as over 70% of the cdf - s agns are detected in at 24 um , such estimates provide an alternative and independent approach to confirming trends derived from the 70  @xmath1 stacks .",
    "we note that those moderate x - ray luminosity agns individually detected at 24 um same follow the trend of increasing @xmath11 luminosity ratio with redshift and are not dominated by small numbers of bright , individual sources .    in summary , both 24  @xmath1 and 70  @xmath1 data reveal a strongly evolving @xmath11 luminosity ratio among moderate luminosity x - ray agns , but there is no evidence of any change among the most luminous x - ray agns in our sample .      the evolution in @xmath11 for the moderate luminosity agns could be due to changes in the agn dusty torus or increased star - formation in the host galaxies .",
    "however , as so few of the cdf - s x - ray agns are detected at 70  @xmath1 , and the stacked @xmath37 ratios lie around the division between agn and starburst - dominated systems ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) , we can not currently use this diagnostics to distinguish between these scenarios . because all other major discriminators between agn activity and star formation ( e.g. , from _ spitzer_-irac photometry ;",
    "@xcite ) also provide inconclusive results for the dominant source of infrared emission in these agns , we consider the impact that _ each _ of these scenarios would have on our understanding of agns and the influence they have on their host galaxies .",
    "if attributed to star - formation alone , the observed increase in the @xmath11 luminosity ratio would imply a significantly enhanced ratio of galaxy to black hole growth in the early universe .",
    "if all this star - formation were to take place within the bulge of the host galaxy , then this would have a significant impact on the development of black - hole / bulge relationships observed in the local universe . using star formation rates derived from @xcite , we estimate that the ratio between star - formation and mass accretion ( @xmath39 ) is comparable to today s bh - bulge mass ratios ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this could be interpreted as tentative evidence that the links between smbhs and their host bulges were initially forged at these early times .",
    "we note , however , that we have not factored in the growth of inactive galaxies in this assessment .",
    "flux densities are based on @xmath25 flux densities of the cdf - s agns extrapolated along the average starburst - dominated and agn - dominated seds , derived from our local sample of agns .",
    "if all the x - ray agns were to have starburst - dominated ir seds , we would expect to detect _ at least _ as high a fraction at @xmath41 as we currently detect at @xmath23 . for comparison",
    "we include the fractions of agns currently detected at @xmath42 .",
    "_ bottom : _ the total number of cdf - s x - ray agns in each bin . from @xcite.,height=264 ]    on the other hand , the increase in the @xmath11 luminosity ratio could also be driven by changes associated with the agn itself .",
    "as the increase is observed in an x - ray luminosity matched sample of agns , this change is unlikely to be caused by differences in the power output of the central engine . on the other hand ,",
    "an increase in the dust covering factor at high redshifts would manifest itself as an increase in the average infrared luminosity .",
    "this interpretation agrees , in principle , with results derived from deep x - ray observations that suggest that agns in the early universe were , on average , more heavily obscured than present- a result also supported by evolutionary models of agns ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the increase in dust covering factor needed to account for the observed increase in @xmath17 is significantly higher than suggested by those studies . indeed ,",
    "if one assumes a typical dust covering factor of @xmath43 in the local universe , then a simplistic interpretation of our results would indicate dust covering factors well in excess of 100% in the early universe .",
    "we note however , that this assumes a linear relationship between @xmath6 and dust covering factor when it is far from clear that this is indeed the case .    finally , as the measured infrared luminosities of the high - z x - ray agns",
    "are based solely on extrapolation using the seds of local agns , it is plausible that the apparent increase in @xmath6 is a result of systematic changes in the seds of agns across the redshifts considered .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested that the seds of purely star - forming galaxies have undergone some degree of change since @xmath5 ( e.g. , magnelli et al . , _ in prep . _ ) .",
    "perhaps this could be also true for agns ? however , with so few high redshift x - ray agns detected at far - infrared wavelengths , it is extremely difficult to determine whether this is indeed the case .",
    "future deep surveys to be undertaken by _",
    "herschel _ promise to remedy this situation and distinguish between these different scenarios .",
    "irrespective of the cause of the increased infrared luminosity , a thorough understanding of how @xmath11 evolves will be necessary in order to identify potential x - ray weak , infrared bright agns at high redshifts and determine their intrinsic luminosities .",
    "with its vastly superior sensitivity at far - infrared wavelengths , the recently launched _",
    "herschel observatory _ will probe a whole new region of the @xmath44 parameter space . our estimates ( based on extrapolation of the 24  @xmath1 flux densities ) indicate that as many as 70% of the x - ray detected agns in the cdf - s will be detected at 100  @xmath1 in the planned ultra - deep _ herschel _ observations of this field ( i.e. , goods - h , p.i . :",
    "d. elbaz ; see fig .",
    "3 ) , compared to the @xmath3110% detected in the deepest _",
    "spitzer _ fir surveys . with such large numbers of detections",
    ", we will be able to constrain the far - infrared seds of the majority of the x - ray agns in the deep fields , providing clear insights into the dominant source of infrared emission in these objects ( i.e. , agn or star - formation activity ) .",
    "this , in turn , will enable us to establish the full extent and cause of the observed increase in the @xmath45 luminosity ratio .",
    "furthermore , the diagnostics described here and in @xcite provide the means to use _ herschel _ photometry to identify significant numbers of agn - dominated systems , including those x - ray weak , compton - thick agns currently missed at all other wavelengths ."
