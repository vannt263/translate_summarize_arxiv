    "two major mechanisms are responsible for making heavy elements beyond fe : the slow ( @xmath2 ) and rapid ( @xmath0 ) neutron capture processes @xcite .",
    "this contribution focuses on recent developments in studies of the @xmath0 process .",
    "extensive reviews on the subject can be found in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a recent comprehensive review of @xmath2-process studies .",
    "there are three major areas of @xmath0-process studies : ( 1 ) properties of extremely neutron - rich nuclei far from stability that are involved in the process , ( 2 ) astrophysical sites and associated conditions that can be used to assess the feasibility of an @xmath0 process , and ( 3 ) frequencies of occurrences and other characteristics of potential @xmath0-process sources that are relevant for chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the second area is discussed in some detail below while the other two areas are mentioned only briefly .",
    "the basic nuclear reactions involved in the @xmath0 process are neutron capture , photo - disintegration , and @xmath3 decay .",
    "the crucial nuclear input for the @xmath0 process includes : ( 1 ) neutron capture rate coefficients @xmath4 , which are averaged over thermal distributions of neutron and nuclei , ( 2 ) photo - disintegration rates @xmath5 , which can be obtained from @xmath6 using detailed balance along with the neutron separation energy @xmath7 and relevant nuclear partition functions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) @xmath3-decay rates @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 stands for a nucleus with proton number @xmath10 and mass number @xmath11 .",
    "as the nuclei involved are extremely neutron rich , branching ratios for emission of up to several neutrons following a @xmath3 decay also play an important role , especially during decay back to stability subsequent to freeze - out of rapid neutron capture .",
    "if the @xmath0 process occurs in core - collapse supernovae , neutrino - induced reactions are important as charged - current ( cc ) @xmath12 capture is equivalent to @xmath3 decay and neutrino - induced neutron emission is efficient following both cc and neutral - current ( nc ) excitation @xcite . if the @xmath0 process produces fissile nuclei , then rates for various fission channels ( e.g. , spontaneous , neutron - induced , @xmath3-delayed , neutrino - induced ) and the corresponding mass distributions of fission fragments should also be included .",
    "only a small fraction of the nuclei involved in the @xmath0 process are accessible to experiments , so the majority of the above nuclear input must be calculated from theory . as this input covers a wide range of nuclear processes , a self - consistent theoretical framework for all",
    "the input is essential .",
    "fortunately , the next generation of rare isotope beam facilities such as frib , riken , and fair will provide crucial guidance to the theoretical efforts in addition to direct measurements of masses and @xmath3-decay rates of some key nuclei for the @xmath0 process .    by definition ,",
    "an @xmath0 process occurs when the neutron capture rate of a typical nucleus involved in the process exceeds its @xmath3-decay rate : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the neutron ( number ) density at the astrophysical site .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 depends on the temperature @xmath15 at the site while @xmath8 is essentially independent of @xmath15 .",
    "the above equation can be used to give a crude estimate of @xmath14 required for an @xmath0 process : @xmath16 \\left[\\frac{\\lambda_\\beta(z , a)}{10\\ { \\rm s}^{-1}}\\right]\\ { \\rm cm}^{-3 } , \\label{eq - nn}\\ ] ] where nominal values for @xmath4 and @xmath8 have been used .    as a parcel of material undergoes @xmath0-processing ,",
    "its @xmath14 and @xmath15 evolve with time @xmath17 .",
    "the temperature @xmath15 is crucial in determining the path of the @xmath0 process .",
    "if @xmath15 is always far below @xmath18  k , the @xmath0 process is cold and photo - disintegration is negligible . in this case , the @xmath0-process flow is controlled by the competition between neutron capture and @xmath3 decay , and the path is populated dominantly by nuclei with @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath15 significantly exceeds @xmath18  k initially , a hot @xmath0 process occurs . for @xmath20",
    "k and @xmath21  @xmath22 , photo - disintegration is sufficiently fast to establish an equilibrium with neutron capture . in this @xmath23 equilibrium ,",
    "the total abundance of nuclei with a specific @xmath10 is concentrated in a few so - called waiting - point nuclei , which are favored by the relevant @xmath14 and @xmath15 based mainly on their neutron separation energies @xmath7 and to a lesser extent , on their nuclear partition functions . as with any statistical equilibrium , the exact rates do not matter so long as they are fast enough for the equilibrium to hold .",
    "so the @xmath0-process path formed by the waiting - point nuclei is specified by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath7 but is insensitive to @xmath4 and @xmath5 when @xmath23 equilibrium holds .",
    "the @xmath3 decay of the waiting - point nuclei regulates the relative abundances for different @xmath10 and dominantly controls the progress of the @xmath0-process flow .",
    "however , when @xmath14 and @xmath15 drop below some critical values , @xmath23 equilibrium breaks down .",
    "this allows @xmath4 and @xmath5 to play important roles in determining the final abundance pattern produced by a hot @xmath0 process .    for both cold and hot @xmath0 processes ,",
    "the overall abundance pattern produced in an individual astrophysical event , e.g. , a core - collapse supernova , is a superposition of abundance patterns produced in different parcels of material that have undergone different time evolution of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "astrophysical models of a hot @xmath0 process are reviewed in the next section , followed by discussion of a cold @xmath0 process induced by neutrino interaction in supernova helium shells .",
    "in the absence of fission , the abundance pattern produced in a parcel of material undergoing a hot @xmath0 process can be approximately characterized by the corresponding average mass number @xmath24 . by mass conservation ,",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the average mass number of seed nuclei that capture neutrons and @xmath27 is the number ratio of neutrons to seed nuclei at the beginning of the @xmath0 process .",
    "so the conditions required for a hot @xmath0 process to produce nuclei with an average mass number @xmath24 can be mapped to those giving rise to the corresponding @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the viability of a model for a hot @xmath0 process can then be assessed by how seed nuclei are produced and how the neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath27 is determined before the actual @xmath0 process occurs .",
    "a generic sequence of evolution prior to a hot @xmath0 process can be illustrated by considering a parcel of material with an entropy @xmath28 in units of boltzmann constant per baryon that adiabatically expands from @xmath29  k. the material at @xmath29  k is essentially composed of free nucleons with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number fraction of neutrons and @xmath32 is the electron fraction ( net number of electrons per nucleon ) .",
    "given @xmath33 and @xmath32 , the nucleosynthesis during the expansion can be calculated once the time evolution of @xmath15 is specified .",
    "a convenient parametric form is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a constant dynamic timescale .    for @xmath36 ,",
    "nearly all protons are assembled into @xmath37he when @xmath15 decreases to @xmath38  k. at lower @xmath15 , an @xmath39 process occurs to burn neutrons and @xmath37he @xcite . here",
    "the role of @xmath33 is manifest . due to the absence of stable or long - lived nuclei at @xmath40 and 8",
    ", the nuclear flow must go through the three - body reaction @xmath41 to produce nuclei beyond @xmath37he . for @xmath42 , there are a sufficient number of photons at or above 1.573  mev , the threshold to break up @xmath43be , in the planck distribution for @xmath44  k. so the higher @xmath33 is , the more inefficiently heavy nuclei are produced . in any case , charged - particle reactions effectively cease when @xmath15 drops to @xmath45  k due to the coulomb barrier . by then the inventory of heavy nuclei produced",
    "typically have @xmath4690 .",
    "these nuclei act as seed nuclei to capture the remaining neutrons during the subsequent @xmath0 process as @xmath15 continues to decrease .",
    "clearly , there are an infinite number of combinations of @xmath33 , @xmath32 , and @xmath35 that can give the same @xmath24 according to eq .  .",
    "this can be seen from the determination of @xmath27 .",
    "approximately speaking , there are three different ways to produce a higher @xmath27 : ( 1 ) a lower @xmath32 to increase the initial neutron abundance , ( 2 ) a higher @xmath33 to suppress production of seed nuclei by keeping the abundance of @xmath43be low , and ( 3 ) a smaller @xmath35 also to reduce seed production but by shortening the duration of the @xmath39 process . the @xmath0-process abundance pattern in the solar system is characterized by two peaks at @xmath47 and 195 , respectively . to produce the peak at @xmath48 requires @xmath49",
    "figure  [ fig - sye ] shows three contours in the @xmath50-plane that would all give @xmath49 for the corresponding values of @xmath35 indicated .",
    "these results are taken from @xcite and can be used to gauge the viability of an astrophysical environment to produce an @xmath0-process abundance peak at @xmath48 .",
    "similar results can be found in @xcite .",
    "specific astrophysical models of a hot @xmath0 process are discussed below .    ,",
    "@xmath32 , and @xmath35 required for adiabatically expanding material to produce nuclei with @xmath49 through a hot @xmath0 process .",
    "see text and @xcite for details . ]",
    "core - collapse supernovae are intimately associated with neutrinos .",
    "essentially all the gravitational binding energy of a proto - neutron star formed in these events , @xmath51  erg , is radiated in @xmath12 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 over @xmath57  s. a fraction of the @xmath12 and @xmath52 can be absorbed by the material immediately above the proto - neutron star through the reactions @xmath58 during the @xmath57  s of neutrino emission , the proto - neutron star blows a wind as the energy deposited by the above reactions continuously lifts shells of material out of its gravitational potential well . if reaction proceeds more efficiently than reaction , the wind material is driven neutron rich ( @xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "when this material reaches sufficiently large radii , these reactions effectively cease due to small neutrino fluxes .",
    "subsequently , the material approximately undergoes the generic evolution outlined above for adiabatic expansion with fixed @xmath33 , @xmath32 , and @xmath35 .",
    "earlier studies of nucleosynthesis in neutrino - driven winds based on the supernova models of j.  r. wilson showed that a hot @xmath0 process occurs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , later studies @xcite could not reproduce the high entropies in these models . typically , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61  s were obtained . for these conditions , the elements sr , y , and zr with @xmath62 are readily produced , and for the most favorable among these conditions , the elements from pd and ag with @xmath63 up to te immediately below @xmath47 can be produced ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", all these elements are produced in quasi - equilibrium of forward and reverse reactions involving photon , neutron , proton , and @xmath39 particle but not by an @xmath0 process ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , heavy @xmath0-process elements with @xmath64 , especially those in the solar @xmath0-process abundance peak at @xmath48 , can not be produced under these conditions ( see fig .  [ fig - sye ] ) .",
    "as @xmath32 depends on the competition between reactions and , it is extremely sensitive to the difference between the emission characteristics of @xmath12 and @xmath52 @xcite . in contrast ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath35 are not sensitive to this difference as they depend on the net heating by both @xmath12 and @xmath52 .",
    "recent calculations including more neutrino transport processes showed that neutrino - driven winds are always proton rich ( @xmath65 ) @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to a new process of nucleosynthesis , the @xmath66 process @xcite , which produces elements beyond the fe group mostly via proton capture .",
    "without neutrinos , those `` waiting - point '' nuclei in @xmath67 equilibrium must @xmath3 decay before the nuclear flow can proceed further ( cf . a hot @xmath0 process ) and a waiting - point nucleus with a very slow @xmath3-decay rate effectively terminates the flow .",
    "the flow proceeds much further in the presence of an intense @xmath52 flux because the neutron produced by reaction can enable an @xmath68 reaction that has the same effect as but is much faster than @xmath3 decay .",
    "therefore , the @xmath66 process can produce elements far beyond the fe group .",
    "it was shown that the elements from sr , y , and zr to pd and ag with @xmath62110 can be produced in both proton - rich and neutron - rich winds @xcite . so while neutrino - driven winds are unlikely to produce heavy @xmath0-process elements with @xmath64 , they are an important source of the above elements .",
    "further , they served as a detailed case study of novel processes of nucleosynthesis that were not envisioned in the classical papers of burbidge et al .",
    "@xcite and cameron @xcite on the origin of the elements .",
    "stars with masses @xmath69 develop fe cores and those with @xmath70 develop o - ne - mg cores before they undergo core collapse ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these two groups of stars differ greatly in structure as the density above an o - ne - mg core falls off much more drastically than that above an fe core @xcite . so far o - ne - mg core - collapse supernovae are the only case for which neutrino heating [ mostly via reactions and as in the case of neutrino - driven winds ] has been demonstrated to result in a successful explosion ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    the surface layers of an o - ne - mg core are slightly neutron rich due to processing by pre - supernova nuclear burning .",
    "the evolution of such a layer subsequent to being struck by the supernova shock again approximately follows adiabatic expansion with fixed @xmath33 , @xmath32 , and @xmath35 . due to the steep density gradient above the o - ne - mg core",
    ", the shocked material may expand rapidly with @xmath71  s. this along with @xmath72 and @xmath36 ( see fig .  [ fig - sye ] ) would enable a hot @xmath0 process to produce nuclei with @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "however , current models of o - ne - mg core collapse based on nomoto s models of the associated supernova progenitors @xcite only give a weak explosion , for which the shocked surface layers of the core expand with @xmath74  s and @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "as these layers are not extremely neutron rich , no hot @xmath0 process can occur under the conditions obtained in current models .",
    "it remains to be seen if more favorable conditions can be obtained for new models of stars that develop o - ne - mg cores .",
    "figure  [ fig - sye ] shows that for @xmath76  s with @xmath77 and @xmath78  s , nuclei with @xmath73 can be produced by a hot @xmath0 process for @xmath79 .",
    "the above ranges of @xmath33 and @xmath35 occur in neutrino - driven winds from proto - neutron stars .",
    "however , @xmath79 can not be obtained in these winds without invoking new physics such as sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to explore alternative candidate environments for a hot @xmath0 process where such low @xmath32 values may be obtained more naturally along with similar @xmath33 and @xmath35 to those in neutrino - driven winds .",
    "some fe - core collapse supernovae are expected to produce black holes rather than neutron stars .",
    "an accretion disk typically forms around the black hole .",
    "such disks can also form in mergers of two neutron stars or of a neutron star with a black hole .",
    "the disk material close to the black hole is hot and dense and emits neutrinos similarly to the surface layers of a proto - neutron star .",
    "in addition , this material may be very neutron rich as a result of the reaction @xmath80 .",
    "a fraction of this material is ejected in winds due to heating by dynamic processes in the disk or by neutrino reactions and .",
    "parametric models suggest that adequate conditions , in particular low @xmath32 values , may be obtained in these winds for a hot @xmath0 process to occur @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if such conditions can be derived in self - consistent models of the accretion disk and the associated winds .",
    "it is especially important that detailed neutrino transport in the disk be carried out similarly to that in modern core - collapse supernova models .",
    "material of low @xmath32 stocked up inside a neutron star can be released by tidal force during mergers of two neutron stars or of a neutron star with a black hole . once released from the strong gravitational hold of its parent neutron star , such material undergoes decompression , which is accompanied by heating due to @xmath3 decay .",
    "the possibility of a hot @xmath0 process during the expansion of decompressed neutron - star matter was discussed in the pioneering work of lattimer et al . @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of this @xmath0-process model is that the nuclear flow typically reaches fissile nuclei and becomes cyclic as the fission fragments capture neutrons to replenish the flow .",
    "this fission cycling is expected to produce a robust abundance pattern at @xmath64 , which appears to be in accord with observations of metal - poor stars in the galactic halo but with some notable exceptions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a potential problem with @xmath0-process models based on neutron star mergers is that these events occur @xmath81 times less frequently than core - collapse supernovae in the galaxy .",
    "were neutron star mergers a major source for heavy @xmath0-process elements with @xmath64 , stars with the earliest such enrichments would have been enriched with high fe abundances by the numerous core - collapse supernovae that had already occurred prior to the contributing @xmath0-process event @xcite .",
    "this is in contradiction to observations of a number of metal - poor stars that are enriched in heavy @xmath0-process elements but have [ fe / h ]  @xmath82 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it remains to be seen if more detailed models of galactic chemical evolution may resolve the above difficulty .",
    "the notion of a unique type of sources that produce heavy @xmath0-process elements with @xmath64 over the entire history of the galaxy has some appeal but is far from required by observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed above , winds from black hole accretion disks and decompressed ejecta from neutron star mergers could both be production sites for such elements .",
    "the difficulty of neutron star mergers to account for observed enrichments of heavy @xmath0-process elements at [ fe / h ]  @xmath83 leads to the question whether other sources could have operated at such low metallicities .",
    "in fact , such a source was proposed by epstein , colgate , and haxton ( ech ) @xcite . in their model ,",
    "nc neutrino reactions on @xmath37he nuclei produce neutrons for an @xmath0 process via @xmath84 or @xmath85 followed by @xmath86 .",
    "this occurs in helium shells of metal - poor core - collapse supernovae , where neutrons are left alone by the predominant @xmath37he nuclei but captured by the fe nuclei acquired at the birth of the supernova progenitors .",
    "the helium shells have @xmath87  k , and therefore , the ech mechanism is a cold @xmath0 process .",
    "the neutron density for this mechanism depends on the competition between production by neutrino reactions and capture by fe and other nuclei .",
    "consequently , @xmath88  @xmath22 required for an @xmath0 process [ see eq .",
    "] can only be obtained at low metallicities .",
    "the ech mechanism was critiqued in @xcite as viable only for low - mass metal - poor supernovae , where helium shells are located at relatively small radii to ensure sufficiently large neutrino fluxes .",
    "follow - up studies were carried out in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that a modified ech mechanism could operate in core - collapse supernovae with [ fe / h ]  @xmath83 over a range of progenitor masses @xcite . for a @xmath89 progenitor with [ fe / h ]  @xmath90 @xcite",
    ", a cold @xmath0 process occurs in the outer helium shells at radii of @xmath91  cm , where the abundances of @xmath92c and @xmath93o nuclei produced by pre - supernova helium burning are too low to cause significant neutron capture .",
    "the cc reaction @xmath94 turns out to be the dominant source of neutrons because the temperature is too low for the reaction @xmath86 to be effective @xcite .",
    "further , the cc reaction rate is greatly enhanced when the energy spectra of @xmath54 and @xmath56 are much harder than that of @xmath52 at emission and an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy enables @xmath95 transformation below the outer helium shells @xcite .",
    "more systematic studies of the modified ech mechanism are needed to assess its contribution to galactic chemical evolution .",
    "it is conceivable that this mechanism operated in the early galaxy until [ fe / h ]  @xmath96 and neutron star mergers provided the subsequent @xmath0-process enrichments .",
