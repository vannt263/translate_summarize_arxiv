    "the instability of deterministic motion is typically characterized by the growing separation of initially nearby trajectories , which , in turn , indicates that dynamics is high sensitive to its initial state ; very small differences at one moment in such systems can result in very large differences later on . for a chaotic dynamical system @xmath3",
    ", the separation of initially nearby trajectories , namely @xmath4 , evolves asymptotically as @xmath5 within any infinitesimal neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "the positive coefficient @xmath7 stands for the largest lyapunov exponent for @xmath8 , and most of well - known chaotic systems are ruled by dispersion rates @xmath1 of this type @xcite .",
    "after the pioneering work of gaspard and wang @xcite , there has been in recent years a growing interest in understanding weakly chaotic ( sporadic ) systems for which the separation of initially nearby trajectories is weaker than exponential , i.e. @xmath1 sublinear @xcite . for these systems",
    ", the conventional lyapunov exponent vanishes and the weakly chaotic behavior results from the intermittent switching between long regular phases ( so - called laminar ) and short irregular bursts .",

    "then , we tie all of its spatio and temporal properties , including the map equations itself , to a single characteristic function @xmath0 .",
    "the main step towards a unifying framework is based on determining the eigenfunctions of feigenbaum s renormalization operator @xcite @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a rescaling factor .",
    "the eigenfunction that defines the universality class is a fixed point of @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 .",

    "considerations so far about universality have been based on the scaling properties of the laminar length @xcite .",
    "our results also shed some light on the scaling hypothesis behind the relationship between laminar length and feigenbaum s operator ( [ feig ] ) .",
    "we provide a general formula for the dispersion rate @xmath1 , one of the main results of this manuscript .",
    "but besides an attempt to outline the subexponencial instability in weak chaos , our goal is to provide a full description of a nonlinear dynamical system in which a scaling property is present .",
    "here we have two key quantities determining the spatio and temporal properties of weakly chaotic systems .",
    "the invariant density @xmath22 gives us the measure of concentration trajectories at each stage of intermittency , whereas the residence times at each stage are ruled by the waiting - time probability density function @xmath23 of the laminar region . by introducing a proper modeling of intermittency mechanism , together with a renormalization - group approach , we establish a universal criterion for the choice of @xmath0 which enables us to predict the dispersion rate @xmath1 , as well as determining @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we will also see that these results enable us to predict the anomalous subdiffusion for spatially extended versions of such systems by means of a relationship between @xmath1 and the mean squared displacement @xmath24 .",
    "subexponential instability ( [ wcc ] ) is a consequence of the infinite invariant measure @xmath25 over the laminar region , and we will establish here this relationship quantitatively . on the other hand ,",
    "the stagnant motion of laminar region is also related to eq .",
    "( [ wcc ] ) , leading to an algebraic behavior of waiting - time probability density as we shall see later on . in hamiltonian systems ,",
    "such behavior corresponds to the tendency of nonescaping particles to concentrate around regular regions , such as stable islands @xcite and invariant tori of nearly - integrable systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , a @xmath12 weakly chaotic model has been recently used to model the nekhoroshev stability @xcite , see @xcite .",

    "although the global form of @xmath34 is less relevant here , the mechanism of intermittency also relies on the existence of a second branch such that @xmath35 , ensuring the chaotic reinjection of trajectories to the laminar region near the marginal point . the best known model that meets these criteria are pomeau - manneville type maps @xmath36 mod 1 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are positive parameters @xcite .",
    "this and others examples will be discussed in the next sections .",
    "one key ingredient for the resulting weakly chaotic behavior ( [ wcc ] ) is how invariant density of @xmath34 behaves near the marginal fixed point .",

    "this model should be understood as a @xmath108 limiting case for the rescaling factor @xmath109 .",

    "why does the laminar length @xmath68 scale according to the feigenbaum renormalization operator ?",
    "the extension of the renormalization operator for the class of systems discussed here can be understood by means of the scaling limit @xmath134 since we have @xmath135 near zero . by using recursion , it is simple to see that eq .",

    "notice that although weakly chaotic systems ( [ wcc ] ) are ruled by the same renormalization operator employed in the logistic map @xcite , what fundamentally distinguishes one case from the other are the boundary conditions behind their eigenfunctions .",
    "a matter that deserves to be revisited in the literature is the perturbation analysis of the renormalization operator @xcite since only the behavior of eigenfunctions near the marginal point is relevant here .",
