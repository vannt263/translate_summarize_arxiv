    "recently , the microetching and epitaxial growth techniques have enabled semiconductor nanostructures to be fabricated with feature sizes down to nanometers .",
    "such nanostructures include t - shaped quantum wires in which quasi - one - dimensional confinement is achieved at the intersection of two quantum wells .",
    "both experimental and theoretical studies on the nonlocal ballistic transport of these structures have been stimulated .",
    "in general , t - shaped quantum wires can be fabricated by first growing a gaas / al@xmath5ga@xmath6as multilayers on a ( 001 ) substrate , after cleavage , a gaas quantum well is grown over the exposed ( 110 ) surface , resulting in an array of t - shaped regions where carrier wavefunctions can be confined in several tens of angstroms .",
    "t - shaped quantum wires ( tqw ) possess some improved optical properties of one dimensional excitons , such as the excitonic laser emission , the enhancement of excitonic binding energy , and the concentrated oscillator strength .",
    "the conductance of such a mesoscopic structure exhibits many peculiar and interesting features due to its intrinsic nonlocality .",
    "quantum conductance in mesoscopic structures is the consequence of a complex scattering process which involves the boundary and the shape of the potential across the structural geometry as a whole .",
    "several studies on the electronic transmission properties for a t - shaped quantum structure have been carried out.@xmath7  many interesting transmission characteristics , such as resonant transmission and resonant reflection in the t- shaped structures have been revealed .",
    "such behaviors are caused from the quantum interference which dominates the ballistic transport regime .",
    "theoretically , one may view the resonance as being mediated by the quasibound states of the system .",
    "the system of t - shaped quantum wires has open geometry , therefore , the injected carriers that travel ballistically over the wire region will across the wire region and show a strong energy dependent transmission as a consequence of quantum interference effect induced by the interplay between the propagating modes of the wires .    by using the scattering matrix approach and landauer - buttiker theory , goldoni _ et .",
    "al._@xmath8 have calculated the conductance of t - shape and coupled t - shaped quantum wires with different wire widths .",
    "the transmission coefficient of the whole coupled t - shaped quantum wires can be obtained easily since the total t - matrix is the product of the t - matrices of the isolated wires . the double resonance obtained in their result",
    "is ascribed to a fingerprint of the bonding and antibonding combinations of the resonance states of the isolated wires .",
    "bohn@xmath9 has introduced a periodic array of t - shaped devices .",
    "he showed that deflected arrays exhibit a unique resonance structure with respect to electrons traveling along the array .",
    "the coefficients of the reflection and transmission through the array can peak simultaneously at resonance . unlike the analogous case in superlattices ,",
    "the peaks are at energies where the wavelength @xmath10 satisfies the condition @xmath11 for some integer @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , the scattering wave function possesses nodes at the intersection of the longitudinal arm and the transversal arm , and thus greatly reduces the flux lost to transversal leads .",
    "nikolic and sordan@xmath13 have also studied the transmission properties of a quantum waveguide system with attached stubs in the ballistic regime .",
    "they found the transconductance and the differential drain conductance are small .",
    "their result suggests limited abilities for conventional application of the transistor .",
    "calculated transmission of electrons in a t - shaped opened quantum waveguide ( toqw ) subjected to an inhomogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the toqw plane with mode - matching technique .",
    "the transmission profiles are found to depend sensitively on geometric parameters .    in this work ,",
    "we study a @xmath2-shaped opened quantum structure and its clone shape , which are four - terminal waveguide - like structures , schematically as shown in fig.1 .",
    "we take first the geometric variation into account .",
    "second , the interconnection region is considered to be acted by a potential .",
    "third , the magnetic field is considered to apply to the vertical wires . unlike the stubs , arms of the structures considered in our case are assumed to be long enough and open in the longitudinal and the transverse directions .",
    "the centers of the two vertical arms are spaced by a distance @xmath4 as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the scattering matrice are calculated by using mode - mathing method .",
    "our model will be presented briefly in the next section .",
    "results and discussions will be given in the final section .",
    "we model the structure geometry as illustrated in fig.1 : a horizontal wire with a width of @xmath15 @xmath16 for region i ( vii ) , a vertical wire with a width of @xmath17 @xmath18 for region ii ( v ) , an interconnection part for region iv and a junction region with an area of @xmath19 @xmath20 for region iii ( vi ) . in the wire ,",

    "the transverse potential inside the wire is set to zero .",

    "first of all , we consider that all wires are the same width , namely @xmath93 .",

    "2(a ) and ( b ) for different @xmath4 .",
    "curves from bottom to top in fig.2(a ) are shifted by 1.0 for clarity and correspond to the cases of @xmath95 1 , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.5 , 1.7 , and 2.0@xmath15 , respectively . and curves from bottom to top in fig.2(b )",
    "are shifted by 1.0 for clarity and correspond to the cases of @xmath95 2 , 2.5 , 3.0 , and 5.0@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we present the transmission probabilities of the @xmath2qw system as solid lines and those of the @xmath2cqw system as the dotted lines in all figures .    for @xmath95 1 ,",
    "the vertical wires are adjacent to each other .",
    "thus , a @xmath2qw with @xmath96 , can be regarded as a tqw with a double width in the vertical arm except there is an infinite thin wall along the vertical arm axis .",
    "however , one can note from the figure that the profiles of transmission of a @xmath2qw with @xmath96 are quite different from the transmission profiles of a tqw with the same width ( @xmath97  of the vertical arm@xmath98 .  in fact",
    ", the bottom curve of @xmath2qw ( @xmath99 is similar to the result obtained in tqw with a vertical arm of @xmath100 width as obtained in ref ( 8) .",
    "this implies that the two systems are similar except the transmission amplitude is suppressed in a @xmath2qw system . for",
    "the @xmath2cqw , the sharp dip at @xmath101 is replaced by a wider valley before @xmath102 .",
    "the transmission behaviors of the two structures ( @xmath2qw and @xmath3cqw ) are different in general , however , their periodic oscillations are the same . the period of the oscillation is dominated by the distance @xmath4 as can be seen from fig.2 .",
    "the periodicity can be fitted as @xmath103 approximately , where @xmath12 is the number of periods in one mode , and @xmath104 denotes the longitudinal wave length of the incident electron waves .",
    "thus , once one finds two peaks in the region @xmath105 for @xmath106 , then four peaks will be found for @xmath107 , and so on .",
    "curves in both structures ( @xmath2qw and @xmath2cqw ) possess peak - dip structures .",
    "especially , these peak - dip structures are more clear for larger @xmath4 at @xmath108 . on the contrary ,",
    "they are observed only in certain circumstance for smaller @xmath4 . according to the previous result@xmath98 ,",
    "there exists a localized state in the intersection region for a symmetric toqw with same wavenumber @xmath108 .",
    "the peak - dip structure at @xmath109 can be ascribed to this localized state .",
    "the peak - dip structure is found at @xmath108 on the curve with @xmath110 for @xmath2cqw . for @xmath4 larger than @xmath111 , the peak - dip structure is sharper in @xmath2cqw than that in @xmath2qw .    due to the fact that both @xmath2qw and @xmath2cqw structures are equivalent to a system of two tqws , one may expect that the transmission properties of these two structures will be the same if the coupling between the constituent tqws becomes very weak .",
    "however , our result does not manifest this accordance . on the contrary ,",
    "the two transmission profiles are still distinguishable from each other even for large @xmath4 .",
    "it is also found that the transmission probabilities vary periodically with @xmath4 for a fixed wavenumber as shown in fig.3 .",
    "these behaviors are the essential characteristics of ballistic theory .",
    "now let us consider the case that the widths of the vertical wires are the same , while the ratio of the width of the vertical wire to the horizontal wire is varied .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "4 . for simplicity , we define the ratio of the width of the vertical wire to the horizontal wire as @xmath112 . and the distance @xmath4 is set to @xmath113 . curves from the bottom to the top are shifted by 1.0 individually for clarity and correspond to the cases of @xmath114 = 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 and 4.0 , respectively , as shown in the figure . for extremely small @xmath114 , perfect stepwise profiles are observed in both structures .",
    "the transmissions are strongly suppressed when the ratio @xmath115 is large ( e.g. 2.0 and 4.0 ) .",
    "the solid curve for @xmath116 agrees with the result of previous work@xmath8 .",
    "a double resonance is evident either on the curve of @xmath117 or the curve of @xmath116 .",
    "they are the signature of the bonding and antibonding combinations of the resonant quasi-1d state of isolated wires .",
    "finally , the transmission profiles in the @xmath2qw and @xmath2cqw with vertical wires of different width are considered . for simplicity",
    ", the width of one vertical wire is kept to be the same as that of the horizontal wire .",
    "the calculated transmission profiles for @xmath118 and different @xmath17 are shown in fig.5(a ) and those for @xmath119  and various @xmath120 are shown in fig.5(b ) .",
    "curves are offset for clarity .",
    "curves from bottom to top correspond to the cases of @xmath114=0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 4.0 , and 5.0 , respectively .",
    "where @xmath114 is the ratio of the wire width of the vertical wire to the horizontal wire .",
    "it is observed that the transmission probability is drastically suppressed for large @xmath114 as can be seen from the upper curves in ( a ) and ( b ) . comparing curves in ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", we observe that the transmission profiles are the same .",
    "when @xmath114 is small , the transmission profiles of the @xmath2qw and @xmath2cqw become indistinguishable and almost the same as that of tqw system .",
    "the double resonance can be observed again .",
    "we now consider the case that an additional scalar potential is applied to the interconnection region iv .",
    "the applied potential can be negative or positive for attracting or depleting electrons .",
    "the different coupling profiles are interesting and may be important for practical usage of the mesoscopic devices .",
    "fig.6 presents the calculated transmission profiles for different potential strength @xmath121 in unit of @xmath122 .",
    "here we consider @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "figs.6(a ) and ( c ) correspond to the positive potential for electrons .",
    "figs.6(b ) and ( d ) correspond to negative potential .",
    "curves are offset for clarity .",
    "as shown in fig.6(a ) , one can observe that the positive potential does not affect the transmission very much when @xmath125 .",
    "> from figs.6(a ) and ( c ) , two features are shown : ( 1 ) the onset is shifted due to the depletion potential ; ( 2 ) the positions of transmission dips are not changed .",
    "on the contrary , figs.6(b ) and ( d ) show that the additional negative potential affects the transmission much stronger than the positive one .",
    "especially , the potential enhances the coupling between the two toqws as one can note from the fact that the resonant dip - peak - dip structure becomes broader and shallower when the potential is increased .",
    "more peaks are on the curves and the positions of dips are not changed as the case of positive potential .",
    "moreover , it can be observed that discrepancy between the two structures becomes prominent as the potential strength is increased .",
    "these results manifest that the negative potential increases the coupling strength between the two individual toqws .      finally , magnetic fields are considered to apply to the vertical wires only , therefore , the electrons pass through the main arm regions with no additional field .",
    "we shall study the effect of the surrounding magnetic fields on the transmission behavior .",
    "first , we consider the magnetic field is applied only to one of the vertical wires , i.e on arm ii or arm v. the direction of the field is perpendicular to the 2deg plane .",
    "transmission probabilities are calculated as a function of fermi wave vector as depicted in fig.7 .",
    "curves in fig.7(a ) are offset for clarity , and correspond to the cases of magnetic field strength @xmath126 -1.0 , -0.7 , -0.5 , -0.3 , -0.2 , -0.1 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , 1.0 tesla , respectively in region ii .",
    "those shown in fig.7(b ) are the same except the magnetic field is applied to region v. > from these curves , one can conclude that : ( 1 ) the magnetic field does affect the transmission , although the electrons do not pass through the region with magnetic field directly .",
    "this phenomenon is according with aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "however , no periodic behavior can be found .",
    "( 2 ) for the @xmath2qw system as shown in solid curves in figs.7(a ) and ( b ) , both cases show a one - to - one correspondence to each other .",
    "this manifests that the influence of the magnetic field on the transmission profile depends only on the magnetic field strength .",
    "however , there is no correspondence in the case of @xmath2cqw which is presented by the dotted lines in figs.7(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "( 3 ) generally speaking , opposite polarity of the magnetic field causes different influence on the transmission in @xmath2cqw systems .",
    "the transmission profiles versus fermi wave number @xmath94 for the case that the magnetic field being applied to both regions ii and v , are displayed in fig.8 .",
    "fig.8(a ) presents the transmission in the @xmath2qws and @xmath2cqws with same polarity in both vertical arms , and fig.8(b ) presents those with opposite polarity to each other in the two vertical arms .",
    "the curves are offset for clarity .",
    "the solid lines represent the @xmath2qw systems and dotted lines represent the @xmath2cqws systems .",
    "it is found that for the case of @xmath2qws , though the geometry and the applied field are symmetric , the transmission probabilities are different from each other ( e.g. the solid curves with @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) as can be seen from fig.8(a ) .",
    "however , for the case of @xmath2cqws , the transmission are polarity independent as can be noted from the dotted curves in fig.8(a ) .",
    "no such symmetry can be found in @xmath3cqw as shown in fig.8(b ) .",
    "furthermore , peak - dip structures are evident both in figs.(a ) and ( b ) at high field situations , though the electrons always move in field free region .",
    "one can expect that the transmission profiles will become stepwise structures when the applied magnetic field is extremely high . and",
    "in the intermediate field strength , the magnetic field changes the oscillatory behavior of the profiles significantly .",
    "in the present work , the transmission properties of the coupled toqws are found to be very sensitive to the geometric configurations as well as the strength and polarity of the applied fields .",
    "a double resonance is observed on the profiles at certain ratio of the width of the vertical wire to the horizontal wire .",
    "the transmission is suppressed drastically as the width of one or both vertical wires become large .",
    "most of the transmission profiles of @xmath2qw and @xmath2cqw are distinguishable even for large inter- distance @xmath4 between the two vertical wires .",
    "the  transmission profiles exhibit oscillatory behavior as the distance @xmath4 is increased and manifest periodic features as the distance @xmath4 is varied .",
    "t - shaped quantum wires have been proposed to achieve the quantum interference effect by controlling the length of its lateral closed arms . in the present study , it is found that the interference pattern can be easier to obtain by modulating the length and width of transversal arms and the distance between arms .    when a potential is added to the connection region",
    ", it results in decoupling or coupling effects between the two tqws according to whether it is positive or negative .",
    "this behavior is observed by the alternating occurrence of the successive dips and valleys when the potential is increased positively .",
    "though the electrons pass through only the field free region , the magnetic field still affects the transmission in the qws profoundly .",
    "the perfect transmission can be seen only in the high magnetic field region ."
