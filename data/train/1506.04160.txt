    "most stars form in high - mass clusters @xcite , and the luminous star - forming regions seen in other galaxies are predominantly ( embedded ) high - mass clusters . in terms of luminosity ,",
    "the cluster emission is dominated by the most massive o and b stars , and often global star - formation rates are inferred from their spectra at optical and uv wavelengths @xcite . yet",
    "even the most massive clusters form very few high - mass stars compared to the total number of stars : the inferred star - formation rate thus depends on the mass distribution in the form of an initial mass function ( imf ) to account for the contribution from the low - mass population @xcite .",
    "this population is notoriously difficult to access observationally even in galactic high - mass clusters beyond orion ( @xmath3 = 415  pc , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in particular when this population is still forming and is deeply embedded such as in starburst galaxies .",
    "nearby low - mass clusters , on the other hand , are readily studied and both the initial stellar mass and the core mass functions are well - constrained ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is unclear if the formation conditions , and thereby the resulting core mass function , are the same in high - mass clusters where protostars are exposed to strong radiation fields from high - mass stars .",
    "this poses a problem when extrapolating conditions to extragalactic regions where individual embedded protostars are not resolved .",
    "deeply embedded protostars , both low- and high - mass , are bright in molecular emission and star - forming regions are now traced out to redshifts @xmath4 6 @xcite , with molecular emission in local galaxies resolved into individual massive clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , there is a need for connecting the nearby , well - resolved low - mass clusters with first the galactic massive clusters , and then extrapolating these to nearby extragalactic regions and eventually the higher - redshift starburst galaxies .",
    "one method for probing the embedded low - mass population is through outflow signatures , one of the key signposts of embedded star formation .",
    "the advantage of using outflow emission is that _ (",
    "i ) _ low - mass outflow emission scales with envelope mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a relation which may also hold for high - mass protostars , thereby providing a lower contrast compared to the high - mass protostars in the region , and _",
    "( ii ) _ molecular outflows are uniquely associated with the embedded stages of star formation , both low- and high - mass .",
    "this combination makes outflows a potentially excellent probe of the low - mass end of the imf .",
    "while low - mass outflow properties ( mass , outflow force ) are typically measured based on spatially resolved low-@xmath0 co emission , co also traces bulk cloud properties and is therefore not an ideal tracer of outflows and their parent population .",
    "instead , molecules such as methanol are more suitable : the methanol abundance jumps by orders of magnitude in molecular outflows due to sputtering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in particular the mid-@xmath0 transitions with @xmath5/@xmath6@xmath750 k appear to be ideal from an empirical point of view @xcite .",
    "these transitions are not excited in the cloud where mostly low-@xmath0 transitions emit ( @xmath5/@xmath6@xmath710 k ) and they are only moderately excited in hot cores where emission from higher-@xmath0 transitions is more dominant ( @xmath5/@xmath6@xmath8100 k ) .",
    "the @xmath0=7@xmath96@xmath9 transitions of methanol around 338  ghz are particularly well suited , both because they are good outflow tracers , and because instruments exist to map emission efficiently ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this proof - of - concept study",
    ", we present a cluster model which simulates low - mass outflows and their emission based on the known methanol emission from single low - mass protostars in the regions ngc1333 and serpens main . the outcome of the model is compared to observations of an embedded high - mass cluster as a step toward calibrating the model before employing it for interpretation of extragalactic observations , in particular by assessing what the high - mass outflow and hot - core contribution to the methanol emission is .",
    "the model is described in sect .  2 , and the results are presented in sect .  3 .",
    "the model is compared to observations in sect .  4 , where also the implications and future steps are discussed .",
    "the cluster model consists of two parts : ( i ) a template cluster with stellar spatial , age , and mass distributions and ( ii ) molecular emission assigned to each embedded protostar in the cluster .",
    "below , these components are described separately .",
    "the codes for running the model are publicly available .",

    "the spatial distribution of protostars builds on the model by @xcite where the size of the cluster is @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the number of stars .",
    "this relation works well with @xmath12=1  pc , @xmath13=300 and @xmath14 and these are the parameters employed here .",
    "the radial probability distribution function is d@xmath15/d@xmath16=(3p)/@xmath17 ( r/@xmath17)@xmath18 where the power - law index @xmath19 is set to 1.5 , again following the example of @xcite . the angular distribution is assumed to be uniformly random .",
    "higher - mass stars are often located closer to the bottom of the gravitational potential well , i.e. closer to the cluster center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to simulate this effect in the cluster model",
    ", the distance to the center is re - scaled by @xmath20 once the spatial distribution is calculated above , a method similar to the method employed by @xcite where the index is 0.15 .",
    "this small power - law scaling ensures that the most massive members of the cluster are located within 1020% of the maximum cluster radius , whereas the lower - mass members are hardly affected .",

    "the fraction of protostars in the class i , ii and iii stages as well as the `` flat - spectrum '' stage between class i and ii are taken from @xcite , whereas the class 0 population is from @xcite .",
    "perseus is one of the only low - mass clusters where such complete statistics are available .",

    "typically a cluster with 3000 stars contains @xmath710 high - mass stars ( @xmath22 ) and 1000 brown dwarfs ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "class 0 cores typically have core masses that are three times higher than the final stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the total mass of any core in these evolutionary stages is tripled or doubled , respectively .",
    "the masses of protostellar systems in the remaining evolutionary classes are typically close to their final mass but since molecular outflows from class ii and iii objects are rare and weak , these are not included in the model .    in this model ,",
    "the initial number of stars is specified and the total mass of the cluster is subsequently calculated .",
    "the stellar mass is from the imf ( see above ) and the protostellar masses are obtained by scaling the final stellar mass . the cluster mass is @xmath710@xmath24  @xmath21 for a cluster with 3000 stars when all protostellar contributions are summed up . if the star formation efficiency is of the order of 10% @xcite , i.e. the total stellar mass divided by the initial cloud mass , the initial cloud would have a mass of the order of @xmath710@xmath25  @xmath21 which is typical of observed galactic molecular clouds .",

    "assuming that the emission at distances @xmath4 2@xmath28 is dominated by the low - mass population , the total flux fraction of the low - mass outflows from the entire cluster can be estimated : approximately 50% of the cluster flux is coming from the low - mass outflows , the rest is from a combination of the molecular hot core and the high - mass outflow(s ) . disentangling these contributions",

    "_ if the cluster is younger than 1 myr , the relative number of class 0 and i sources increase and so will the number low - mass outflows . the model presented in fig .",

    "_ the simulated class 0 and i protostars are spread randomly over the entire cluster : if the stars form closer to the center , the protostars would be more concentrated and the flux would increase . indeed , the median distance for a class 0 protostar to the cluster center is 0.4pc , or 25@xmath28 .",
    "all of these possibilities will be explored quantitatively in the future . however , given that the model is not tuned to reproduce the observations such an overlap is excellent and lends credibility to the model predictions even when using a standard imf .",
    "this proof - of - concept study demonstrates one possible method for gaining access to the embedded low - mass protostellar content of a forming cluster , namely through molecular outflow emission from these low - mass protostars , and thereby potentially constraining the initial ( core ) mass function .",
    "because outflow emission is directly proportional to the envelope mass , the contrast between low- and high - mass protostars is effectively lowered by several orders of magnitude compared to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the success of the model in reproducing part of the morphology of a single observed high - mass embedded cluster paves the way for further fine - tuning of the model , and for including the contribution from high - mass outflows and hot cores explicitly in the model .",
    "two avenues will be pursued in the near future : _",
    "( i ) _ parameter space will be explored , in particular with respect to constraining the initial ( core ) mass function of low - mass embedded protostars , and _",
    "( ii ) _ other species will be included . as for the latter , _ herschel _ observations",
    "demonstrate that h@xmath42o and high-@xmath0 co ( @xmath0@xmath416 ) trace shocks and outflows uniquely , and these are the next species and transitions to be included .",
    "although no new observations of h@xmath42o will be done for the foreseeable future , _ herschel _ already observed hundreds of galactic star - forming regions , both low and high mass , thus providing enough data to calibrate the model .",
    "furthermore , alma will easily be able to observe h@xmath42o emission in redshifted galaxies , and models of this type carry the promise of providing constraints on how low - mass stars have formed and how the imf has changed throughout cosmological times ."
