    "the advent of sensitive near - infrared detectors , and the implementation of large - scale imaging surveys ( e.g. , 2mass , sdss , and denis ) at wavelengths outside of the classical optical regime , have resulted in a major revolution in cool star research . in the past decade",
    ", we have witnessed an avalanche of ultra - cool star and brown dwarf discoveries in the field , in young stellar clusters , and as companions to nearby stars ( see basri 2000 for an excellent review ) , pushing to temperatures below 1000 k. these discoveries have required the definition of _ two _ new spectral classes , l dwarfs and t dwarfs , the first major additions to the widely - accepted mk system in over half a century ( see the contribution by s.  hawley in these proceedings for more information ) . indeed , the initially unique companion objects gd 165b ( becklin & zuckerman 1989 ) and gliese 229b ( nakajima et al .",
    "1995 ) are now understood to be the prototypes to these very late classes of stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "`` avalanche '' is an appropriate term here ; despite their recent identification , hundreds of l dwarfs and at least 30 t dwarfs are now known .    in this contribution ,",
    "i review some of the spectral properties of l and t dwarfs in two well - studied wavelength regimes : first , the red optical , typically covering 630010000  , is discussed in @xmath32 ; second , the near - infrared , conventionally 12.5 @xmath0 , is discussed in @xmath33 . in @xmath34 ,",
    "i address future work necessary in both these spectral regions and beyond that will result in a more complete understanding of these cool objects .",
    "the red optical has been an important region of study for the coolest stars , being the brightest spectral region for these objects accessible by ccd detectors .",
    "the first spectrum of an l dwarf , gd 165b , was obtained in the red optical by kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and shown to lack the strong tio bands that characterize m dwarfs . with the discovery of additional `` post - m '' objects ( see basri 2000 ) , it became clear that a new spectral class , the l dwarfs , had been identified . for the t dwarfs ,",
    "initial work in this regime was done by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their analysis of gliese 229b .",
    "these authors identified a number of distinct features , including a steep red slope extending from 860010000  that initially defied adequate explanation .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectral sequence of late - m and l dwarfs in the red optical from kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; see fig .  3 in the contribution by s.  hawley for the identification of the features present in these spectra .",
    "as originally observed in gd 165b , the hallmark tio and vo bands weaken in the l dwarfs , resulting in a fairly transparent atmosphere in which hydrides and alkali lines become prominent .",
    "feh ( 8692 , 9896  ) , crh ( 8611 , 9969  ) , and cah ( 6750  ) are all present , strengthening in the early - type l dwarfs and weakening in the later types .",
    "h@xmath1o also produces an important feature at 9250  , which strengthens toward later spectral types and is important in the t dwarfs as well .        the depletion of molecular species , likely caused by the formation and rainout of dust ( tsuji , ohnaka , & aoki 1996 ; ackerman & marley 2001 ) , allows the less refractory alkali doublet lines to come into prominence , including na i ( 5890/5896 and 8183/8195  ) , k i ( 7665/7699  ) , cs i ( 8521/8943  ) , and rb i ( 7800/7948  ) .",
    "the large column abundances of both sodium and potassium in these clear atmospheres enable their resonance doublet features to become quite pronounced via pressure - broadening .",
    "this can be seen in the case of k i by the wide trough centered at 7700  in the latest l dwarfs , growing from the sharper features present in the late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs .",
    "the na i 5890/5896  d lines produce a similar feature at shorter wavelengths ( reid et al .",
    "the li i line at 6708  is also present in l dwarfs with masses below 0.06m@xmath4 ; rebolo et al .  (",
    "1992 ) first pointed out the utility of this feature as an indicator for substellarity .",
    "kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimate that over 1/3 of the field l dwarfs identified by 2mass are brown dwarfs , based on the presence of this line in their spectra . the other line feature frequently seen in these spectra is h@xmath5 emission at 6563  .",
    "contributions by s.  hawley and s.  mohanty provide further discussion on h@xmath5 emission in l dwarfs .",
    "the seemingly smooth variation of these features in the observed l dwarf population has resulted in two competing classification schemes : that of kirkpatrick et al .  ( 1999 ) , which spans subtypes l0 v to l8 v ; and that of martn et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which spans subtypes l0 v to l6 v. utilizing both band and color indices to classify subtypes , these systems agree fairly well for the early and mid - l dwarfs , but diverge beyond type l4 .",
    "hopefully the current treasury of l dwarf spectra will allow convergence of these two schemes in the near future .",
    "the last spectrum in figure 1 is that of the prototype t dwarf , gliese 229b , from oppenheimer et al .",
    "its spectrum is quite different that those of the latest l dwarfs , due to deeper h@xmath1o absorption , absence of hydrides , and steeper spectral slope .",
    "however , it was unclear at the time of its discovery if the photosphere of gliese 229b is influenced by its primary , which could naturally lead to an unusually red spectrum ( griffith , yelle , & marley 1998 ) .",
    "o , and ch@xmath2 are indicated , as are alkali lines .",
    "the heavily broadened na i and k i features are indicated by dashed lines .",
    "subtypes are from burgasser et al .",
    "( 2001).,width=226 ]    figure 2 shows red optical spectra of a series of t dwarfs and one l8 dwarf from burgasser ( 2001 ) ; subtypes are those defined in burgasser et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see @xmath33.2 ) .",
    "all of these t dwarfs are field objects and show the same steep spectral slope in the red as gliese 229b .",
    "liebert et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that the increasingly broadened k i doublet seen in the l dwarfs is generally responsible for this slope and the corresponding red optical / near - infrared colors of t dwarfs , as is obvious in the spectra in the right panel of figure 2 .",
    "na i d lines suppress flux shortward of 7000  , an extension of the behavior seen in the latest l dwarfs .",
    "there are also a number of unbroadened atomic features present in these spectra , including cs i at 8521/8943  and the much weaker rb i doublet at 7800/7948  .",
    "the former lines appear to be strong throughout the t sequence , although they fade rapidly in the latest subtypes .",
    "the latter are only seen in the highest signal - to - noise spectra and are generally weak , buried in the broadened k i feature .",
    "note that li i at 6708  has not yet been detected in any of the t dwarfs .",
    "the most prominent molecular features in the red optical spectra of t dwarfs are the h@xmath1o bands starting at 9250 and 9450  , respectively .",
    "these bands strengthen considerably throughout the t sequence , and provide powerful diagnostics for classification . an feh band at 9896 ",
    "is also seen in some of the spectra of figure 2 , appearing to strengthen somewhat between the latest l dwarfs and the mid - t dwarfs , then fading again toward the latest t subtypes .",
    "its higher - order counterpart at 8692  is seen only in the earliest t dwarfs , which is also the case for crh at 8611  .",
    "the 9969  band of crh is weak or absent in all of the t dwarfs .",
    "a weak signature of cah around 67507150  , seen in m and l dwarfs , also appears to be present but weak in the brightest early t dwarfs .",
    "finally , ch@xmath2 , which is ubiquitous in the near - infrared spectra of t dwarfs ( see @xmath33.2 ) , produces a weak band centered at 8950  in the latest subtypes .",
    "the presence of this feature is made ambiguous by its coincidence with cs i at 8943  .",
    "finally , steady h@xmath5 emission has been detected in the spectrum of 2mass 1237 + 6526 ( burgasser et al .",
    "2000b ) , and a much weaker line has been seen in the spectrum of 2mass 1254 - 0122 ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "none of the other t dwarf spectra show emission features .",
    "we refer the reader to the contribution of s.  hawley in these proceedings for further discussion of h@xmath5 emission in t dwarfs .",
    "the near - infrared is an useful region for the study of l and t dwarfs , as the spectral energy distributions of both classes peak at roughly 1 @xmath0 .",
    "the first spectrum of an l dwarf , gd 165b , was obtained by jones et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who noted the importance of h@xmath1o and co absorption in these cool dwarfs , as well as their apparent reddening as compared to warmer m dwarfs ( cause by thermal dust emission ) .",
    "nearly all of the spectroscopic work on t dwarfs has been done in the near - infrared due to sensitivity considerations 9 ( golimowski et al .",
    "indeed , it is the difference in the near - infrared spectra of l dwarfs and gliese 229b due to ch@xmath2 absorption that prompted kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to designate a new class for these cool brown dwarfs .",
    "figure 3 shows the near - infrared spectra of three late m dwarfs and three l dwarfs from leggett et al .",
    "the deepening of the h@xmath1o bands at 1.15 , 1.4 , and 1.85 @xmath0 for these objects is readily apparent in the data .",
    "not surprisingly , the h@xmath1o bands split the near - infrared spectra of l dwarfs into peaks centered at the three telluric windows , around 1.2 , 1.65 , and 2.15 @xmath0 ; the l dwarf h@xmath1o bands are significantly broader than telluric absorptions , however , due to the higher temperatures of l dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the relative brightness of these flux peaks ( increasing importance of k - band ) reflects the reddening of l dwarfs in near - infrared colors .",
    "o , and co are indicated , as are atomic lines of na i and k i.,width=377 ]    co is a key absorber at k - band ; the bandheads beyond 2.3 @xmath0 are clearly seen in the m9 dwarfs , with the some slight strengthening in the l dwarfs .",
    "the latest - type objects also show absorption beyond the 2.1 @xmath0 peak ; this was originally attributed to ch@xmath2 by delfosse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , but later identified as collision - induced absorption ( cia ) of h@xmath1 by tokunaga & kobayashi ( 1999 ) .",
    "cia h@xmath1 is an important contributor to the total opacity in the cold , high - gravity atmospheres of both l and t dwarfs .",
    "recently , geballe et al .  ( 2001 ) have found indications of weak ch@xmath2 absorption at k - band in their latest l9 dwarfs in addition to the cia h@xmath1 opacity",
    ".    there are finer features present at j - band in the l dwarfs .",
    "in particular , k i doublet lines at 1.169/1.177 and 1.243/1.252 @xmath0 are quite strong in the l dwarfs , weakening somewhat for the latest subtypes ( mclean et al .",
    "these are higher - order lines than the 7700  resonance doublet , and hence do not broaden as strongly .",
    "na i lines at 1.138/1.141 @xmath0 show similar behavior .",
    "additional alkali lines of rb i and cs i are likely present but buried in the broad 1.4 @xmath0 h@xmath1o band .",
    "feh features at 1.194 , 1.210 , and 1.237 @xmath0 are present and strong in the early subtypes , eventually fading along with the 9896  band ( mclean et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in analogy to the red optical ,",
    "the evolution of features in the near - infrared has allowed the derivation of classification schemes for l dwarfs in this wavelength regime .",
    "reid et al .  ( 2001 ) and testi et al .  ( 2000 ) have made use of h@xmath1o and color indices to derive spectral classification schemes tied to the kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) optical sequence .",
    "geballe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have defined an independent near - infrared classification scheme that extends to subtype l9 , consistent with both the kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and martn et al .",
    "( 1999 ) optical classifications at early types , but diverging somewhat for the latest subclasses .",
    "see the contribution by t.  geballe in these proceedings for further discussion .",
    "it is hoped that ongoing analysis will ultimately produce a consistent system that matches red optical and near - infrared subclasses .",
    "figure 4 shows low - resolution spectra of t dwarfs and two l dwarfs in the 12.5 @xmath0 region , with important molecular and atomic features indicated ( higher resolution spectra are given in the contribution by t.  geballe ) .",
    "these data show that both h@xmath1o and ch@xmath2 absorption bands are the dominant features shaping the spectra of t dwarfs .",
    "the addition of ch@xmath2 bands ( beginning at 1.05 , 1.3 , 1.6 , and 2.2 @xmath0 ) to the h@xmath1o bands seen in the l dwarfs ultimately confine the emitted flux of these objects into narrow peaks centered at 1.08 , 1.27 , 1.59 , and 2.07 @xmath0 .",
    "ch@xmath2 absorption effectively removes half of the emitted flux from the h- and k - bands , while the gradually developing slope between the 1.27 @xmath0 peak and the 1.4 @xmath0 h@xmath1o band is caused by ch@xmath2 at 1.3 @xmath0 .",
    "earlier - type t dwarfs than those shown here have weaker ch@xmath2 absorption , resulting in the dual presence of ch@xmath2 and co bands at 2.2 and 2.3 @xmath0 ( leggett et al .",
    "cia h@xmath1 is also present at k - band , suppressing flux throughout the 22.5 @xmath0 region absorption also peaks around 1.2 @xmath0 but is 100 times weaker . ] .",
    "variation in the strength of h@xmath1 absorption amongst the known t dwarf population has been noted by burgasser et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in the peculiar t dwarf 2mass 0937 + 2931 , possibly indicative of extreme gravity and/or metallicity differences .",
    "see the contribution by s.  leggett in these proceedings for further observations of this effect .",
    "o , ch@xmath2 , cia h@xmath1 , and co are indicated , along with the location of feh ( in the l dwarfs ) and k i features at j - band ( from burgasser et al .",
    "2001).,width=377 ]    atomic lines of k i at j - band appear to remain strong from the l dwarfs through most of the t dwarfs , but weaken somewhat in the very latest t subtypes . indeed , both burgasser et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and geballe et al .",
    "( 2000a ) note an absence of these lines in the coolest known t dwarf gliese 570d ( burgasser et al .",
    "the spectra of figure 4 are generally too low to resolve the k i lines , but their trends can be seen in the evolution of the notch feature around 1.25 @xmath0 .",
    "feh lines seen in the l dwarfs at j - band are not seen in the t dwarfs .",
    "t dwarf classification has only recently been addressed by burgasser et al.(2001 ) and geballe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , with both authors using near - infrared features of h@xmath1o , ch@xmath2 , and color to derive very similar schemes .",
    "we defer discussion of t classification to the contribution of t.  geballe , but show in figure 5 the spectral standards from burgasser et al .",
    "these data highlight the clear strengthening of band features and weakening of the k i lines throughout the sequence .",
    "since their first discovery , there have been significant advances made in the observational study of brown dwarfs .",
    "the focus of these studies has primarily been in the red optical and near - infrared , enabling the thorough characterization of brown dwarfs in these wavelength regimes as described in this article .",
    "there is a great deal to be learned in this region , however , particularly in the interpretation of the spectra .",
    "theoretical modeling of brown dwarf atmospheres has advanced greatly ( see burrows et al .  2001 and chabrier & baraffe ( 2000 ) for recent reviews ) , but significant work remains in detailing the differential effects of temperature , gravity , and metallicity on emergent spectra ; updating molecular opacities for adequate modeling ; and",
    "incorporating self - consistent treatment of dust and grain opacities , including cloud formation and rainout ( see the contribution by m.  marley in these proceedings ) . the latter problem is particularly critical in understanding the transition between the dusty l and relatively dust - free t subtypes .",
    "there has been interesting work recently done outside of the 0.62.5 @xmath0 regime for both l and t dwarfs .",
    "strong co absorption has been detected in the t dwarfs gliese 229b ( noll , geballe , & marley 1997 , oppenheimer et al .",

    "in addition , the fundamental band of ch@xmath2 at 3.3 @xmath0 has been detected in mid- to late - l dwarfs , which has possible implications on the temperature scale of l and t subclasses ( noll et al .",
    "further work beyond 5 @xmath0 , which can be accomplished via sirtf and sofia , could potentially enable the direct detection of dust species in this objects , as well as strong bands of nh@xmath6 , h@xmath1s , and alkali chlorides ( the repository for atomic alkali species below @xmath7800 k ; lodders 1999 ) .",
