    "1/2 bps circular wilson loops in 4d @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory are interesting observables which can be computed exactly by a gaussian matrix model @xcite . via ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , 1/2 bps wilson loops in the fundamental representation correspond to the fundamental string in type iib string theory on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "when the rank of the representations becomes large , the corresponding dual objects in the bulk are not fundamental strings but d - branes , and such wilson loops are sometimes called `` giant wilson loops '' . in particular ,",
    "1/2 bps wilson loops in the rank @xmath4 symmetric and anti - symmetric representations correspond to d3-branes and d5-branes , respectively , with @xmath4 unit of electric flux on their worldvolumes @xcite . the leading term in the t hooft expansion of @xmath0 sym side is successfully matched with the dbi action of d - branes in the bulk side . for more general representations ,",
    "a dictionary between wilson loops in higher rank representations and bulk d - brane picture was proposed in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the subleading corrections in this correspondence .",
    "recently , there are some progress in the computation of one - loop correction in the @xmath1 expansion of giant wilson loops @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on the subleading corrections in the large @xmath5 expansion ( or @xmath6 expansion ) with @xmath5 being the t hooft coupling @xmath7 , and we will restrict ourselves to the leading order in the @xmath1 expansion . from the holographic dictionary @xmath8 , the large @xmath5 expansion on the sym side corresponds to the @xmath9 expansion in the bulk string theory side .    in this paper , we consider the large @xmath5 expansion of the 1/2 bps wilson loops in the anti - symmetric representation .",
    "using the fact that the generating function of anti - symmetric representations can be written as a system of fermions , one can systematically compute the subleading corrections in the large @xmath5 expansion by a low temperature expansion of the fermi distribution function , known as the sommerfeld expansion . here",
    "the role of temperature is played by @xmath10 .",
    "we have checked numerically that the subleading corrections agree with the exact expression of the anti - symmetric wilson loops recently found in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : fermi ] , we find a systematic large @xmath5 expansion of anti - symmetric wilson loops using the sommerfeld expansion of fermi distribution function .",

    "we consider the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of 1/2 bps circular wilson loops in @xmath0 sym with gauge group @xmath11 . after applying the supersymmetric localization @xcite ,",
    "the wilson loop vev is reduced to a gaussian matrix model @xmath12\\biggr\\ket=\\int dm e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\pi g_s}\\operatorname{tr}m^2}\\operatorname{tr}_r ( e^m ) .",

    "we are interested in the subleading corrections of @xmath26 .",
    "there are two expansion parameters @xmath17 and @xmath6 . in @xcite",
    ", it was reported that the one - loop correction in the @xmath17 expansion has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an order 1 constant . in this paper",
    ", we will consider subleading corrections of the @xmath6 expansion while we focus on the leading order in the @xmath17-expansion .",
    "as we will show below , the @xmath6 expansion of @xmath26 can be computed as @xmath37 . \\end{aligned }",
    "\\label{eq : w - expand}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is our main result .    let us explain how we obtained .",
    "to study the anti - symmetric wilson loops systematically , it is convenient to introduce the generating function of @xmath26 by summing over @xmath4 with fugacity @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the expectation value in the gaussian matrix model @xmath41 using the large @xmath42 factorization we find @xmath43 up to @xmath1 corrections , and the right hand side of in the planar limit becomes @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the wigner semi - circle distribution of gaussian matrix model @xmath46 then , as discussed in @xcite , the wilson loop vev in the @xmath20 anti - symmetric representation is written as an integral over the chemical potential @xmath47 @xmath48 .",

    "thus we conclude that @xmath52 is essentially given by the legendre transform of @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is determined by the saddle point equation @xmath56 note that the fluctuation of @xmath47-integral around the saddle point gives rise to a subleading correction in @xmath17 , as in the case of abjm fermi gas @xcite , and hence we can safely ignore such corrections for our purpose to study the leading order behavior in the @xmath17 expansion from to are also subleading in the @xmath17 expansion , and we simply ignore them as well . ] .    noticing that the fermi distribution function naturally appears in the derivative of @xmath53 @xmath57 one can easily compute the @xmath6 expansion by the standard sommerfeld expansion in statistical mechanics , where @xmath10 plays the role of temperature .",
    "the large @xmath5 expansion of fermi distribution function reads @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the value of bernoulli polynomial @xmath60 at @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the step - function @xmath63 introducing the variable @xmath64 by @xmath65 one can easily show that @xmath66 is expanded as @xmath67 , \\end{aligned }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which the expansion of @xmath53 is found to be @xmath68 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , solving the saddle point equation order by order in @xmath6 expansion , and plugging the solution @xmath55 into , we arrive at our main result . in this way",
    ", we can compute the @xmath6 expansion of @xmath26 up to any desired order .",
    "let us compare our result with the exact result of anti - symmetric wilson loops at finite @xmath42 and @xmath4 found in @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "it is found in @xcite that the generating function of @xmath26 is exactly written as a characteristic polynomial of @xmath69 matrix @xmath70 @xmath71 where the matrix element @xmath72 is given by the generalized laguerre polynomial @xmath73 from this expression , one can extract the exact value of wilson loop vev @xmath26 at arbitrary value of @xmath74 and @xmath17 .    in fig.[fig",
    ": logw ] , we show the plot of @xmath52 as a function of @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , corresponding to the value of string coupling @xmath78 .",
    "the blue dots are the exact values obtained from while the red dots are the plot of our result for the leading term ( fig.[fig : logw](a ) ) and the leading @xmath79 next - to - leading terms ( fig.[fig : logw](b ) ) .",
    "one can clearly see that the leading @xmath79 next - to - leading terms in fig.[fig : logw](b ) exhibit a nice agreement with the exact result .",
    "interestingly , the leading term alone is not enough to reproduce the behavior of the exact result , and the next - to - leading correction has a rather large contribution for this choice of parameters @xmath80 .",
    "note that the leading and the next - to - leading terms in are of order @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , while the higher order terms have negative powers of @xmath5 , hence in the large @xmath5 limit higher order corrections in are suppressed .",
    "indeed we have checked that the inclusion of higher order corrections does not change the plot significantly , and the exact result is well approximated already at the next - to - leading order .",
    "we have performed similar numerical checks for various values of @xmath42 and @xmath5 ( @xmath83 ) and find a good agreement for all cases .",
    "we have computed the @xmath6 expansion ( or @xmath9-expansion of bulk type iib string theory ) of wilson loop vev in the anti - symmetric representation using the sommerfeld expansion of fermi distribution function .",
    "it would be very interesting to reproduce this result from the computation of @xmath9-correction of the d5-brane action in the @xmath3 background .",
    "there are many things to be studied further .",
    "it is important to develop a method to compute both the @xmath6 expansion and the @xmath17 expansion systematically . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to find the @xmath6 expansion of wilson loop vev in the symmetric representation by the low temperature expansion of bose distribution .",
    "however , the integrand of the @xmath47-integral might have a singularity corresponding to the onset of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "it would be interesting to understand the analytic structure of the integrand in the case of symmetric representation ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "also , it is interesting to understand the convergence property of the expansion . for the 1/2 bps wilson loop in the fundamental representation , it is observed that the @xmath2-expansion is _ not _ borel summable @xcite , reflecting the fact that there are corrections of order @xmath84 which is non - perturbative in @xmath9 .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand the borel summability of @xmath2-corrections at fixed @xmath17 for wilson loops in various representations .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath17 expansion of 1/2 bps wilson loops with fixed @xmath5 seems to have a finite radius of convergence expansion numerically using the result in @xcite .",
    "] , which is consistent with the absence of yang - mills instanton corrections to wilson loop vev in @xmath0 sym @xcite .",
    "we hope that the study of wilson loops in various representations will provide us with precious information of the non - perturbative structure of string theory .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize the importance of our findings .",
    "it was reported in @xcite that there is a discrepancy between the computation on the field theory side and the string theory side of the one - loop correction in @xmath1 ( see @xcite for the current status of this problem ) . however , before settling the issue of this problem of one - loop correction , we have to compute the leading term at large @xmath42 as a function of @xmath5 , including all @xmath6 corrections . after having found the leading term , one can try to study the one - loop correction in @xmath1 , either numerically or analytically , by subtracting the leading term from the exact result . in this computation , it is important to subtract the subleading terms in @xmath6 since they are rather large and can not be neglected , as we have seen in section [ sec : compare ] .",
    "we believe that our result is an important first step to resolve the issue of the one - loop discrepancy .",
    "we leave the study of one - loop correction as an interesting future problem .",
