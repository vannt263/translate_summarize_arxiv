    "the wigner @xmath0-symbol ( or racah @xmath2-coefficient ) is a central object in angular momentum theory , with many applications in atomic , molecular and nuclear physics .",
    "these usually involve the recoupling of three angular momenta , that is , the @xmath0-symbol contains the unitary matrix elements of the transformation connecting the two bases that arise when three angular momenta are added in two different ways .",
    "such applications and the definition of the @xmath0-symbol based on them are described by edmonds ( 1960 ) .",
    "more recently the @xmath0- and other @xmath3-symbols have found applications in quantum computing ( marzuoli and rasetti 2005 ) and in algorithms for molecular scattering calculations ( de  fazio  2003 , anderson and aquilanti 2006 ) , which make use of their connection with discrete orthogonal polynomials ( aquilanti  1995 , 2001a , b ) .",
    "the @xmath0-symbol is an example of a spin network , a graphical representation for contractions between tensors that occur in angular momentum theory .",
    "the graphical notation has been developed by yutsis ( 1962 ) , el baz and castel ( 1972 ) , lindgren and morrison ( 1986 ) , varshalovich ( 1981 ) , stedman ( 1990 ) , danos and fano ( 1998 ) , wormer and paldus ( 2006 ) , balcar and lovesey ( 2009 ) and others .",
    "the @xmath0-symbol is the simplest , nontrivial , closed spin network ( one that represents a rotational invariant ) .",
    "spin networks are important in lattice qcd and in loop quantum gravity where they provide a gauge - invariant basis for the field .",
    "applications in quantum gravity are described by rovelli and smolin ( 1995 ) , baez ( 1996 ) , carlip ( 1998 ) , barrett and crane ( 1998 ) , regge and williams ( 2000 ) , rovelli ( 2004 ) and thiemann ( 2007 ) , among others .    alongside the yutsis school of graphical notation and the clebsch - gordan school of algebraic manipulation",
    "there is a third approach to the evaluation of rotational ( @xmath4 ) invariants .",
    "the third method , sometimes called chromatic evaluation , grew out of penrose s doctoral work on the graphical representation of tensors and is closely related to knot theory .",
    "we will not have further occasion to mention this school , see penrose ( 1971 ) for its introduction , rovelli ( 2004 ) for an overview and kauffman and lins ( 1994 ) for its full development .",
    "the asymptotics of spin networks and especially the @xmath0-symbol has played an important role in many areas . by `` asymptotics '' we refer to the asymptotic expansion for the spin network when all @xmath5 s are large , equivalent to a semiclassical approximation since large @xmath5 is equivalent to small @xmath6 .",
    "the asymptotic expression for the @xmath0-symbol ( the leading term in the asymptotic series ) was first obtained by ponzano and regge ( 1968 ) , or , more precisely , they obtained several formulas , valid inside and outside the classically allowed region and in the neighborhood of the caustics .",
    "in the same paper those authors gave the first spin foam model ( a discretized path integral ) for quantum gravity .",
    "the formula of ponzano and regge is notable for its high symmetry and the manner in which it is related to the geometry of a tetrahedron in three - dimensional space .",
    "it is also remarkable because the phase of the asymptotic expression is identical to the einstein - hilbert action for three - dimensional gravity integrated over a tetrahedron , in regge s ( 1961 ) simplicial approximation to general relativity .",
    "the semiclassical limit of the @xmath0-symbol thus plays a crucial role in simplicial approaches to the quantization of the gravitational field .",
    "for all these reasons , the asymptotic formula of ponzano and regge for the @xmath0-symbol has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "ponzano and regge obtained their formula by inspired guesswork , supporting their conclusion both with numerical evidence and arguments of consistency and plausibility .",
    "the formula itself is of the one - dimensional wkb - type , a reflection of the fact that the @xmath0-symbol fundamentally represents a dynamical system of one degree of freedom .",
    "the ponzano - regge formula was first derived by neville ( 1971 ) , using the recursion relations satisfied by the @xmath0-symbol and a discrete version of wkb theory .",
    "similar techniques were later used by schulten and gordon ( 1975a , b ) , who also presented stable algorithms for evaluating the @xmath0-symbol numerically .",
    "a proof of a different sort was later given by biedenharn and louck ( 1981 ) , based on showing that the ponzano - regge formula satisfies a set of defining properties of the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "more recently there have appeared more geometrical treatments of the asymptotics of the @xmath0-symbol , that is , those based on geometric quantization ( kirillov 1976 , guillemin and sternberg 1977 , woodhouse 1991 ) , symplectic geometry and symplectic and poisson reduction ( abraham and marsden 1978 , arnold 1989 , marsden and ratiu 1999 ) and other techniques . among these",
    "are the works by roberts ( 1999 ) and by charles ( 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-symbol has been taken as a test case for asymptotic studies of amplitudes that occur in quantum gravity ( barrett and steele 2003 , freidel and louapre 2003 ) , in which the authors developed integral representations for the @xmath0-symbol as integrals over products of the group manifold .",
    "there have also been quite a few other studies of asymptotics of particular spin networks , including barrett and williams ( 1999 ) , baez ( 2002 ) , rovelli and speziale ( 2006 ) , hackett and speziale ( 2007 ) , conrady and freidel ( 2008 ) , alesci ( 2008 ) , barrett ( 2009 ) , among others .",
    "we also mention the works of gurau ( 2008 ) , which applies standard asymptotic techniques ( stirling s approximation , etc ) directly to racah s sum for the @xmath0-symbol ; of ragni ( 2010 ) on the computation of @xmath0-symbols and on the asymptotics of the @xmath0-symbol when some quantum numbers are large and others small ; and of littlejohn and yu ( 2009 ) on uniform approximations for the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "in addition there has been some work on the @xmath7-deformed @xmath0-symbol , important for the regularization of the ponzano - regge spin - foam model ( turaev and viro 1992 , ooguri 1992a , b ) and for its possible connection to quantum gravity with cosmological constant . in particular ,",
    "taylor and woodward ( 2004 ) applied the recursion and wkb method of schulten and gordon to the @xmath7-deformed @xmath0-symbol .",
    "the results are geometrically interesting ( the tetrahedron of ponzano and regge is moved from @xmath8 to @xmath9 when the @xmath7-deformation is turned on ) , but it seems that at present there is no geometrical treatment of the asymptotics of the @xmath7-deformed @xmath0-symbol , analogous to what is available for the ordinary @xmath0-symbol .",
    "there is also the recent work of van der veen ( 2010 ) on the asymptotics of general @xmath7-deformed spin networks , which treats the problem from the standpoint of knot theory and representation theory . among other things ,",
    "this work creates a broad generalization of the schwinger - bargmann generating function of the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "in aquilanti ( 2007 ) we applied multidimensional wkb theory for integrable systems to the asymptotics of the @xmath10-symbol , and in this paper we apply similar techniques to the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "these methods bear the closest relationship to the works of roberts ( 1999 ) and of charles ( 2008 ) .",
    "the point of this paper is not another derivation of the ponzano - regge formula , although one is provided , but rather to clarify the relationship among some of the methods used in the past , to reveal useful calculational techniques , and to lay the basis for the development of new results . among the latter we mention our own work on uniform approximations for the @xmath0-symbol ( littlejohn and yu , 2009 ) , our recent derivation of the asymptotic form for the @xmath1-symbol ( haggard and littlejohn , 2010 ) , both of which relied on techniques explained in this paper , and our work on the bohr - sommerfeld quantization of the volume operator in loop quantum gravity ( bianchi and haggard , 2011 ) .",
    "previous and current work on the volume operator includes chakrabarti ( 1964 ) , lvy - leblond and lvy - nahas ( 1965 ) , lewandowski ( 1996 ) , major and seifert ( 2001 ) , carbone ( 2002 ) , neville ( 2006 ) , brunnemann and rideout ( 2008 , 2010 ) and ding and rovelli ( 2010 ) .",
    "in addition , this paper is distinguished by its use of what we call the `` @xmath11-model '' for the @xmath0-symbol , in contrast to the `` @xmath12-model '' used by roberts ( 1999 ) .",
    "the @xmath11-model is less symmetrical than the @xmath13-model , but it is closer to the manner in which the @xmath0-symbol is commonly used in recoupling theory .",
    "in addition , in loop quantum gravity ( rovelli 2004 ) angular momenta represent area vectors , which in the case of four - valent nodes correspond by minkowski s ( 1897 ) theorem to a tetrahedron . in this context",
    "the @xmath11-model is closer to the applications than the @xmath12-model , indeed , it played an important role in the work of bianchi and haggard ( 2011 ) .",
    "in this paper we refer to aquilanti ( 2007 ) as i , for example writing eqn .",
    "( i.13 ) for an equation from that paper .",
    "we note two errata in i , namely , @xmath14 in ( i.89 ) should read @xmath15 , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 should be swapped in the @xmath0-symbol in ( i.112 ) .",
    "we begin by explaining our notation for spin networks , which is based on that of yutsis ( 1962 ) with modifications due to stedman ( 1990 ) . at the end of this section",
    "we compare our conventions for spin networks with others in the yutsis tradition .",
    "the @xmath10-symbol is a number that can be regarded as the components of an intertwiner @xmath18 with respect to the standard basis @xmath19 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ 3jnetwork ] . in this paper @xmath20 denotes a carrier space for unitary irrep @xmath5 of @xmath4 , so that @xmath21 .",
    "we call @xmath2 the `` wigner '' intertwiner",
    ". we will gradually explain the features of fig .",
    "[ 3jnetwork ] as we proceed .    the standard notation for the @xmath10-symbol is on the left of fig .",
    "[ 3jnetwork ] , while the central diagram is the standard yutsis spin network for the @xmath10-symbol , with small arrows presented as in the yutsis notation .",
    "the indices @xmath22 in the central diagram are covariant , that is , they transform under rotations as the components of a dual vector ( in contrast to an ordinary vector ) . in a hilbert space",
    "we regard ordinary wave functions or ket vectors as `` vectors , '' while bra vectors are regarded as `` dual vectors . ''",
    "thus , contravariant indices are those that transform as the components of a vector . in the yutsis notation",
    "the arrows indicate the transformation properties of the corresponding @xmath23 index , and there are rules for `` raising and lowering '' indices , that is , reversing the direction of the arrow .",
    "the rules do not , however , make use of the metric as in ordinary tensor analysis .",
    "our definition of the arrow ( explained below ) is different from that of yutsis , but designed so that the two notations agree as much as possible . in particular , our notation for the @xmath10-symbol is the same as the yutsis diagram in fig .",
    "[ 3jnetwork ] .    a trivalent node of a spin network such as those illustrated in fig .  [ 3jnetwork ]",
    "is assumed to have a positive or counterclockwise orientation , unless otherwise indicated ( thus we dispense with the @xmath24 sign used by yutsis ) .",
    "the diagram on the right of fig .",
    "[ 3jnetwork ] makes use of the standard basis vectors @xmath25 in @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the spin networks for these basis vectors and their duals are shown in fig .",
    "[ basisvectors ] .",
    "the large , broadly open arrow is a `` chevron '' ( stedman 1990 ) .",
    "when pointing outward ( inward ) , the chevron indicates a ket ( bra ) vector . also shown in fig .  [ basisvectors ] is the spin network for an arbitrary vector @xmath28 in @xmath20 , and the dual bra vector @xmath29 obtained by hermitian conjugation . in the dirac notation",
    "it is customary to label bras by the same symbol as kets , it being understood that the two are related by hermitian conjugation .",
    "this convention is so deeply ingrained that we dare not change it .",
    "but in spin networks there are two different ways of converting kets into bras and vice versa , and this presents some notational challenges .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ basisvectors ] that hermitian conjugation applied to bras and kets is notationally the changing of bra chevrons to ket chevrons and vice versa , and the starring of identifying symbols , with a double star being removed .",
    "full rules for hermitian conjugation of any spin network are given in sec .",
    "[ hermitianconjugation ] .",
    "the lines of a spin network will be referred to as `` edges , '' including cases like those shown in fig .",
    "[ basisvectors ] .",
    "an edge of a spin network ending in an unstarred @xmath23 index represents a contraction with the basis ket @xmath30 , so the @xmath23 index transforms under rotations as a covariant index .",
    "the explicit insertion of basis kets may be seen in fig .",
    "[ 3jnetwork ] .",
    "an edge ending in a starred @xmath23 index represents the insertion of a basis bra @xmath31 , so starred indices are contravariant .",
    "thus , the star on an @xmath23 index indicates its transformation property , and invariant contractions can only take place between a pair of starred and unstarred @xmath23 indices .    as illustrated in fig",
    ".  [ orientation ] , the orientation of a spin network on the page does not affect its value .",
    "the spin network in the figure has been rotated by @xmath32 .    as illustrated in the final diagram in fig .",
    "[ 3jnetwork ] and in fig .",
    "[ scalarprod ] , when a bra chevron and a ket chevron are juxtaposed , it represents the scalar product or contraction . in effect",
    ", the bra chevron acts as a receptacle for the ket chevron , and vice versa .",
    "after the contraction the two edges may be joined , with a small arrow remaining to indicate which was the bra and which the ket in the contraction . one might suppose that the star would carry the same information , but , as shown below , it is possible to change the direction of the arrow without changing the stars .",
    "figure  [ scalarprod ] also presents another example of hermitian conjugation ( complex conjugation , in this case ) . since the small arrow represents the contraction of a bra and a ket chevron , when the chevrons are reversed , the direction of the arrow changes .    as a special case of the scalar product , the orthonormality relations of the basis vectors",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ basison ] .",
    "the final spin network follows from the symmetry of the kronecker delta , or , alternatively , by the reality of @xmath33 and the rules for complex conjugation .",
    "the @xmath5 labels on the edges of the spin networks indicate which carrier space @xmath20 the ket or bra lies in , or in which carrier space a contraction has taken place .",
    "if there are distinct carrier spaces with the same @xmath5 label , then additional distinguishing information must be supplied .",
    "an @xmath4 intertwiner ( the only kind we are interested in ) is a linear map between two vector spaces that commutes with the action of @xmath4 on the two spaces . the only case of interest here is where the target space is @xmath34 , consisting of scalars , that is , invariants under rotations .",
    "the wigner intertwiner @xmath35 is of this type . but a linear map from a hilbert space to @xmath34 can be thought of as a dual or bra vector , for example , we can associate the map @xmath2 with a bra vector @xmath36 belonging to @xmath37 .",
    "the spin network notation for @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "[ wintertwiner ] .",
    "the components of the wigner intertwiner , that is , the @xmath10-symbol , are obtained by inserting basis kets , the ket chevron first , into the bra chevrons of the intertwiner , as in the final diagram of fig .",
    "[ 3jnetwork ] .",
    "more generally , a @xmath34-valued intertwiner on a hilbert space @xmath38 can be regarded as an @xmath4-invariant bra vector on this space , that is , a member of @xmath39 . by hermitian conjugation",
    "we obtain an @xmath4-invariant ket vector in @xmath38 .",
    "thus , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the subspace of @xmath38 of rotationally invariant vectors and the set of @xmath34-valued intertwiners on @xmath38 .",
    "the subspace @xmath40 introduced in sec .",
    "[ 4jmodel ] below is a subspace of this type , consisting of rotationally invariant vectors .",
    "the outer product of a ket with a bra is represented in spin network language simply by placing the spin networks for the ket and the bra on the same page , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the orientations of the bra and ket spin networks is immaterial , but in the figure they have been placed with their @xmath23 indices adjacent in order to emphasize the summation ( a contraction over two indices , one covariant , one contravariant ) .",
    "the final diagram is the spin network for the identity operator on space @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ roi ] illustrates another technique , the replacement of a sum on @xmath23 by a joining of edges .",
    "the general usage is shown in fig .",
    "the directions of the arrows and the stars on one of the @xmath23 s must be coordinated as shown for the identity to be used as shown .",
    "the small arrow in the final diagram in fig .",
    "[ msum ] ( a fragment of a spin network ) is a reminder of the directions of the arrows before the sum .",
    "this small arrow is omitted in the final diagram of fig .",
    "[ roi ] ( the identity diagram ) because the chevrons already indicate the direction of the edge .",
    "recall that edges are also joined on contracting a bra with a ket , as in fig .",
    "[ scalarprod ] .",
    "the use of the identity diagram is illustrated in fig .",
    "the first row illustrates its action on kets ( as a map @xmath41 ) , where bra and ket chevons are combined as in fig .",
    "[ scalarprod ] .",
    "the small arrow is omitted after the joining of the bra and ket chevrons because the remaining chevron indicates the direction of the edge .",
    "the second row of the figure illustrates its action on bras ( the map @xmath42 ) , and the third row illustrates its action as a map @xmath43 , that is , the scalar product map @xmath44 .",
    "all of these usages are encompassed by the same spin network .",
    "the identity spin network can also be seen as an element of @xmath45 , that is , the space dual to @xmath46 on which it , viewed as a @xmath34-valued linear operator , acts ( the third line of fig .",
    "[ idj ] ) .    in general a spin network has some number of edges that terminate in incoming or outgoing chevrons .",
    "examples are the identity diagram in fig .",
    "[ roi ] and the wigner intertwiner in fig .",
    "[ wintertwiner ] . in all cases there",
    "are multiple interpretations of the spin network as a linear operator mapping one vector space to another , depending on how many of the incoming and outgoing chevrons have ket and bra chevrons plugged into them ( specifying the domain ) , and how many are left free ( specifying the range ) .",
    "the domain is the tensor product of some number of @xmath20 times some number of @xmath47 , and so is the range . in the extreme case that all incoming and outgoing chevrons on the spin network have kets and bras plugged into them",
    "the result is simply a number and the range is @xmath34 . in that case",
    "the spin network , as a @xmath34-valued linear operator , can be seen as a vector in the space dual to the domain .",
    "this facile identification of closely associated operators , and their reinterpretation as elements of vector spaces , is an important advantage of spin networks .",
    "it is difficult and awkward to do something similar with the dirac notation .    in general , a tensor is a multilinear operator acting on a tensor product of some set of vector spaces and their duals .",
    "thus , a spin network is a notation for a tensor on some product of the @xmath20 and their duals .",
    "the edges of the spin network terminating in ket or bra chevrons indicate the nature of the space the tensor acts on . in general",
    ", the tensor product of two tensors in spin network notation is indicated by the placing of the two spin networks together on the page , in any orientation .",
    "the outer product of a bra and a ket illustrated in fig .",
    "[ roi ] is a special case .",
    "partial or complete contractions of tensors are indicated by joining some or all ket chevrons with bra chevrons .",
    "we now consider another intertwiner , which leads to an important mapping between kets and bras , alternative to hermitian conjugation .",
    "the intertwiner acts on the hilbert space @xmath49 , the tensor product of two carrier spaces of the same @xmath5 . in general",
    "we wish to consider the second carrier space as distinct from the first , which is the purpose of the prime on the second factor .",
    "to within a normalization and phase , there is a unique vector in this space that is invariant under rotations ; we call it @xmath50 , and express it in terms of the clebsch - gordan coefficients by @xmath51 this vector can also be expressed in terms of the `` @xmath48-symbol , '' which we define in terms of the usual @xmath10-symbol by @xmath52 the terminology `` @xmath48-symbol '' is not entirely standard , but it has been used by stedman ( 1990 ) .",
    "the invariant vector @xmath50 can also be written , @xmath53    by hermitian conjugation we convert @xmath50 into the bra @xmath54 , which is otherwise an intertwiner @xmath55 .",
    "just as the components of the intertwiner @xmath2 are the @xmath10-symbol , the components of the intertwiner @xmath56 are the @xmath48-symbol , multiplied however by @xmath57 because of a normalization convention .",
    "figure  [ 2jnetwork ] shows first the spin network for the components of @xmath56 , which is conceived of as a standard bivalent node or intertwiner .",
    "the small arrows indicate that the components on the first line can be considered the result of plugging basis kets into the intertwiner itself , as seen on the second line .",
    "the short line extending above the node is a `` stub '' ( stedman 1990 ) , whose purpose is to orient the node .",
    "the convention is that if we start at the stub and move in a positive ( counterclockwise ) direction , the first and second edges we encounter are respectively the first and second operands of @xmath56 , conceived of as a map @xmath58 .",
    "we note that if @xmath59 and @xmath2 are vector spaces , then @xmath60 is not the same as @xmath61 , but if we have a bilinear map on @xmath62 it can be extended to a linear map on @xmath61 by linear superposition . for example ,",
    "in the previous paragraph we have regarded @xmath56 as a bilinear map @xmath63 , and computed its components as @xmath64 .",
    "the first and second operands of this expression correspond to the first and second edges as specified by the stub .",
    "figure  [ 2jnetwork ] also gives the numerical values of the components of @xmath56 , and in the final diagram , the network for @xmath56 itself , with two kets inserted .",

    "[ ksymm ] .",
    "the final diagram differs from the preceding simply by a @xmath32 rotation , so the value is the same . but this leads to the rule , that a spin network acquires a phase of @xmath68 when the stub at a bivalent node is inverted . in particular , the arrow on the null edge in fig .",
    "[ vestigialstub ] can be inverted without changing the value .",
    "the intertwiner @xmath72 has an alternative interpretation as a map @xmath73 , where for simplicity we have dropped the prime on the second factor , and where the @xmath74-subscript distinguishes the new map from the old .",

    "when we use @xmath76 to convert a ket into a bra , we just flip the ket chevron , leaving everything else the same . in particular , we do not put a star on the label of the ket .",
    "this distinguishes the map @xmath77 from the metric or hermitian conjugation , which is also a map @xmath78 . when the metric is used to convert a ket to a bra , not only is the ket chevron flipped to a bra chevron , but a star is appended to the label .",

    "these are the importance of the reduced phase space @xmath288 , the geometry of symplectic reduction connecting it with higher dimensional spaces , and the manner in which elements of the semiclassical calculation ( phases , amplitude determinants , etc ) can be mapped from one space to another .",

    "the sum over edges times dihedral angles appears almost immediately . on the other hand ,",
    "we have given a much easier way of computing the amplitude determinant , reducing it to a single poisson bracket , whereas roberts had to evaluate a large determinant .",

    "for now we merely make a few comments .",
    "already in this paper we have mapped amplitude determinants between various spaces , such as the schwinger phase space @xmath268 and the reduced phase space @xmath288 , which are connected by symplecic reduction .",
    "one might guess , therefore , that the @xmath12- or symmetrical model of the @xmath0-symbol and the @xmath11-model are related by some kind of symplectic reduction .",
    "this is not the case , however , at least not in the way that @xmath268 and @xmath288 are related .",
    "one piece of picture , however , is the following .",
    "it is well known that a unitary map on a hilbert space @xmath788 corresponds semiclassically to a symplectic map or canonical transformation @xmath789 , where @xmath232 is the symplectic manifold corresponding to @xmath38 .",

    "the graph of @xmath790 is a lagrangian manifold , one which supports semiclassically the operator @xmath366 in the same way as a lagrangian manifold in @xmath232 supports a vector in @xmath38 .",
    "that is , @xmath366 , which begins as a map @xmath793 , is reinterpreted as a function @xmath794 , that is , a `` wave function '' on a doubled space .",
    "the basic ideas inherent in this picture were developed by hrmander ( 1971 ) and are also present in miller ( 1974 ) , while an elementary explanation of the geometrical situation is given by littlejohn ( 1990 ) .",
    "it turns out that this picture generalizes to linear maps between hilbert spaces @xmath795 , where the two hilbert spaces need not have the same dimensionality and where the map need not be unitary or even invertbible .",
    "the genralization involves again symplectic reduction , but in a different manner than that in which it appears in this paper .",
    "this situation arises in the comparison of two models of the @xmath10-symbol , which is a simpler version of the comparison between the @xmath12- and @xmath11-models of the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "the first is a @xmath48- or clebsch - gordan model , in which the hilbert space is @xmath796 , where the operator @xmath370 is a function of @xmath448 and @xmath369 , that is , @xmath797 .",
    "the second is a symmetrical or @xmath10-model , in which the hilbert space is @xmath798 and the operator @xmath370 is independent , but in which we are interested only in states satisfying the constraint @xmath799 .",
    "we will report on these investigations in the future .",
    "roberts ( 1999 ) derivation of the ponzano - regge formula effectively proceeded by writing the @xmath0-symbol as a scalar product @xmath88 , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are given by fig .",

    "there is one copy of @xmath34 for each degree of freedom , while in a @xmath12-model there are two degrees of freedom for each @xmath5 , hence 24 degrees of freedom total .",
    "roberts then used the stationary phase approximation to evaluate the integral .",
    "the bargmann representation has been used in a similar manner in several recent asymptotic studies in the quantum gravity literature .    in i and in this paper , however , we have mostly worked in a represenation - independent manner .",
    "our emphasis on lagrangian manifolds and other geometrical structures in phase space is part of this approach . from a certain point of view",
    "the coherent state representation is just another representation , albeit a complex one , so there is the question of whether it plays any privileged role or offers any advantages .    for some purposes it certainly does , for example , the wave functions in the coherent state representation are polynomials that can be written down explicitly , and these in turn are useful for deriving generating functions and other things , as shown by schwinger ( 1952 ) and bargmann ( 1962 ) .",
    "another point is that in the case of @xmath4 , the coherent state representation appears naturally in the method of geometric quantization , that is , the holomorphic sections of hermitian line bundles over the symplectic manifold @xmath484 are represented explicitly by bargmann s entire analytic wave functions .    on the other hand",
    ", it is not obvious to us that the identification of the stationary phase set or the other aspects of the semiclassical calculation are easier or more transparent in the coherent state representation than in the representation - independent approach of this paper .",
    "moreover , if one focuses too narrowly on the stationary phase evaluation of an integral , one misses the geometrical structures that support the representation - independent approach .",
    "we had to assemble and extend several of the ideas presented in this paper for our derivation of the asymptotic form of the @xmath1-symbol , and we have studied other extensions such as `` @xmath280-inserted '' spin networks , in which a group element or @xmath197-matrix is inserted in the edges of the spin network .",
    "such @xmath280-inserted spin networks are basic amplitudes in loop quantum gravity ( rovelli 2004 ) , taking one from the basis of spin connections to the spin network basis .",
