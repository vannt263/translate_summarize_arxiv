    "it has been known for a long time that cusps in the velocity dispersion or density profiles could provide strong indication for the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) at the center of a star cluster ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a short review ) .",
    "the existence of these black holes , with masses intermediate between stellar ( @xmath4 ) , and supermassive ( @xmath5 ) , could not be established by observations up until recently , although imbhs were discussed by theorists already more than 30 years ago ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to indirect evidence from , e.g. , so - called ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , sources with luminosities that exceed what can be produced by a stellar mass bh accreting at the eddington limit , measurements of the cusp slopes allow a more direct determination of the mass of an imbh .    however , such cusps might not be easily detectable in real star clusters .",
    "on the one hand , cusps in the surface brightness profile ( sbp ) are expected to be rather shallow , making them difficult to distinguish from standard king models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "measurements of cusps in velocity dispersion profiles , though steeper , have to rely on only a relatively small number of stars for typical globular clusters @xcite .",
    "this especially applies to the old milky way globular clusters ( hereafter gcs ) , where the cluster centers are most likely dominated by dark stellar remnants , reducing the number of observable bright stars in the cusp . based on sbp measurements by @xcite , 9 candidate gcs with inner sbp power - law slopes in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 , indicative of an imbh , have been identified so far @xcite .",
    "these slopes represent , however , only tentative evidence as their error bars , based on photometric and statistical errors , are rather large , ranging from 50 - 100% of the slope value .",
    "in addition , from @xmath8-body and monte carlo simulations it has been found that these slopes are rather time variable such that , e.g. , the inner sbp of a cluster with imbh could even be completely flat for some brief period of time @xcite .",
    "another measure for the mass of an imbh comes from the size of the cluster core , with more massive imbhs producing larger cores as measured by the core - to - half light ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as shown by @xcite , the size of the core is related to the inner sbp cusp slope such that clusters with larger slopes have also lower concentrations if they contain an imbh in their center .",
    "thus , the structure of gcs together with their inner sbp slopes should in principle have the potential to lead to stronger constraints by placing upper _ and _ lower limits on the imbh mass . based on literature values for the inner slopes and concentrations , there are 2 clusters ( from the previous list of 9 imbh candidate clusters of @xcite ) whose concentrations are inconsistent with their inner sbp slopes , leaving 7 imbh cluster candidates .",
    "however , as with the inner slopes of the sbp , the determination of the concentration is plagued with considerable uncertainties .",
    "this is mainly because the escape of unbound stars is delayed @xcite , and thus the escaping stars may contribute significantly to the outer cluster light .",
    "the escaping stars , if not considered , can lead to a much larger apparent tidal cut - off radius , and , thus , to a significantly larger estimate of the concentration parameter @xcite . for instance , in @xcite , we have shown that , although the concentration of the cluster ngc  5694 , quoted as @xmath9 in the harris catalog , is too large for the inner sbp slope of @xmath10 , it is nevertheless still consistent with the presence of an imbh if the flattening of the outer sbp can be attributed to the stellar background .    a less sensitive measure of the mass , but more sensitive to the _ presence _ of an imbh , recently proposed by @xcite , is based on the average mass profile of main - sequence stars normalized to its value at the half - mass radius .",
    "their direct @xmath8-body simulations show that an imbh changes the mass - segregation profile of the cluster such that it effectively counterbalances the tendency of massive stars to concentrate towards the center , similar to what has been reported earlier by @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite suggest that the reason for the so - called `` quenching '' of mass segregation is strong binary interactions between the massive stars sinking towards the center and any companion stars bound to the imbh .",
    "furthermore , a similar mechanism might be responsible for the somewhat weaker quenching of mass segregation in clusters with primordial binaries as in both cases strong binary interactions are involved .",
    "the mass segregation signature does , however , require that the cluster has had enough time to settle down to a dynamically relaxed state , which happens over several half - mass relaxation times .",
    "indeed , many old milky way gcs might be in such a relaxed state , as their estimated half - mass relaxation times are an order of magnitude shorter than their age ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as shown in many studies , relaxed stellar systems evolve towards a self - similar configuration , and the cluster structure is then mostly determined by heating processes in the cluster core , such as interactions with primordial binaries @xcite , or with an imbh @xcite , the formation of three - body binaries @xcite , and stellar collisions @xcite . from a modeling perspective",
    ", this has the advantage that the parameter space of initial cluster conditions to explore for a given observed gc is greatly reduced , as the structure of relaxed stellar systems is rather independent from the conditions at the time of their formation .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrate that dynamic age estimates based only on the current state of clusters are very unreliable , for two reasons .",
    "first , the half - mass relaxation time is generally time dependent , so there is a dependence of the dynamic age on the previous evolutionary history of the cluster ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "second , given a final state , the dynamic age can differ significantly depending on the initial cluster size with respect to the tidal boundary .",
    "for instance , when a cluster significantly underfills its roche lobe it expands freely , increasing its relaxation time , whereas for tidally filling clusters the relaxation time can decrease as the cluster can not expand beyond the tidal radius while its core is contracting ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . as an added difficulty",
    ", it may be hard to decide in which of these categories the evolution of a particular observed cluster falls , as the tidal field the cluster experienced may have been strongly time - dependent and could require extensive analysis to constrain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence of the uncertainties in the dynamic age estimates , it is not clear _ a _ _ priori _ whether a cluster is in the fully relaxed state or , possibly , still in its core contraction phase , which may have consequences for the observability of imbh signatures .    from this discussion",
    "it becomes clear that meaningful constraints on the mass of a possible imbh at the center of an observed gc require extensive analysis of detailed , realistic evolutionary cluster models , which are then compared to observations . in this paper",
    "we extend our analysis in @xcite and consider , in addition to the sbp , kinematic and mass segregation signatures . as an example of direct comparison to observations we focus on the cluster m10 ( ngc  6254 ) .",
    "this cluster is especially suited for such a comparison given its close proximity to the sun ( @xmath11 ) and multitude of available observational data @xcite .",
    "in addition to considering more observables , we now also consider clusters that fill their roche lobes and are significantly influenced by tidal stripping .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly present the cluster monte carlo method , and describe initial conditions for the simulations and observations of m10 . in section 3",
    "we present surface density , surface brightness , average mass profile , and velocity dispersion profiles from our models with and without central imbh , and determine the maximum mass a hypothetical imbh could possess to be still compatible with observations .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "we carried out a large parameter study to model gcs with and without imbh using our cluster monte carlo code ( cmc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as with direct @xmath8-body codes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cmc uses a star - by - star , discrete representation of the cluster , and the code is now able to treat all relevant processes such as stellar evolution @xcite , strong interactions between stars and binaries @xcite , as well as the dynamics of a central massive bh , including an advanced treatment of the loss cone physics needed to accurately estimate the rate of cluster heating @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the cluster is computed on the relaxation timescale ( i.e. , the timestep is a fraction of the relaxation time , @xmath12 for a typical gc , rather than the much shorter dynamical time , @xmath13 ) which enables us to calculate the evolution of massive gcs in a relatively short time ( typically less than a week on a modern workstation ) .    our study consists of approximately 500 model calculations varying imbh mass , initial number of stars , cluster concentration , and distance from the galactic center . the positions and velocities of the stars",
    "are initially distributed according to king models , and their masses are chosen according to the kroupa imf @xcite in the range from @xmath14 to @xmath15 . the initial virial radius for all clusters has been selected such that the cut - off radius of the king models coincides with the cluster s roche , or tidal , radius , @xmath16 , in an external tidal galactic field , given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total cluster mass , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the galactic circular velocity and galactocentric distance , respectively . for all runs we set @xmath21 , the standard value for the milky way .",
    "as in our previous study we included @xmath22 hard binaries in some of our models , given their potential influence on the sbp @xcite and mass segregation profile @xcite .",
    "each star was tested for entry into the loss - cone , the region of angular momentum and energy space where the periapse of the stellar orbit is smaller than the tidal disruption radius of the star around the imbh .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed description .",
    "the metallicity , @xmath23 , for the stars was set to @xmath24 , and all models are evolved for @xmath25 .",
    "we calculated the surface brightness and surface density profile by converting the stellar radius and bolometric luminosity for each star obtained from the cmc stellar evolution module bse to v - band luminosity using the standard stellar library in .",
    "then , certain selection criteria are applied , the stellar positions projected onto the sky , and the stars binned , all in correspondence with the relevant observations ( see next section ) . table [ tab : parameter - ranges - explored ] summarizes the parameter ranges explored .",
    ".[tab : parameter - ranges - explored]parameter ranges explored . all models were tidally filling , and their half - mass radii , thus , given by @xmath16 from equation [ eq : rt ] and @xmath26 , range approximately from @xmath27 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure [ fig : one - dimensional - velocity - dispers ] we show the projected one - dimensional velocity profile of our model with @xmath28 including only bright main - sequence stars and giants above certain brightness cut - offs . each point in this profile represents the velocity dispersion of 20 neighboring stars .",
    "as can be seen , the velocity dispersion cusp extends out to @xmath29 and contains in each case @xmath2 bright stars .",
    "furthermore , the velocity dispersion of the innermost point is only about 50% larger than the average in the cluster core , even when the completeness limit is as low as @xmath30 .",
    "given that the statistical fluctuation of each point , as determined from 10 random projections of the cluster on the sky , is @xmath31 , this increase is barely significant .",
    "only for a limit of @xmath3 does the velocity dispersion of the innermost point become significantly larger , and , with twice the value , can be clearly distinguished from the core velocity dispersion .",
    "the reason for the increase in velocity dispersion with decreasing brightness cut - off is that , as more stars are included , the first 20 stars sample a region closer to the imbh , where velocities are larger .    from this we can see that detecting an imbh with only about @xmath32 in m10 based on velocity dispersion measurements alone is extremely challenging and would require very deep observations with completeness limits down to @xmath3 .",
    "this is despite the fact that the radial extent of the cusp , out to about @xmath33 , is large enough to be easily resolved .",
    "the sparseness of bright stars in the central region prevents sampling the velocity dispersion close enough to the imbh to detect a significantly increase above the core velocity dispersion .",
    "we carried out monte carlo simulations to constrain imbhs at the centers of observed gcs considering a variety of observational diagnostics .",
    "in contrast to our earlier study @xcite , we focused on a cluster , m10 , that undergoes significant tidal stripping , resulting in final cluster masses of only about 20% of the initial .    from a comparison to a detailed star count profile we were able to put an upper limit on the mass of a hypothetical imbh in m10 .",
    "we find that the maximum imbh mass that results in a sdp that still fits the observed profile is @xmath34 .",
    "this imbh mass also also leads to a sbp that is compatible with observations by @xcite , although due to the large radial fluctuations caused by very bright giants , the sbp is less constraining .",
    "this is in contrast to our earlier investigation of the cluster ngc  5694 @xcite where the sbp was much less noisy .",
    "the reason is mostly likely that the light in m10 is dominated by bright giants as we find that the model profile shape is rather sensitive to the chosen cut - off brightness .",
    "this could be a direct consequence of the preferential loss of low - mass stars through tidal stripping , which causes the low - mass end of the mass function to flatten , and the brighter , more massive giants contribute more to the total cluster light .",
    "the more detailed analysis in @xcite might lead to a much smoother profile , and , therefore , could have the potential to obtain stronger constraints for an imbh in m10 than star count data , as integrated light measurements generally include the contribution of many more stars .",
    "in addition to light and star count profiles , we also considered the amount of mass segregation in m10 as an indicator of an imbh .",
    "our main finding is that m10 is not dynamically relaxed enough for the imbh signature , a relative depression of the mean stellar mass at the cluster center , to be detectable . indeed , when calculating the number of elapsed half - mass relaxation times ( equation [ eq : n_trh ] ) , m10 is dynamically only half as old as ngc  5694 and still in its core contraction phase .",
    "similar to the case of ngc  5694 in @xcite , this demonstrates that simple dynamical age estimates based on the current state of globular cluster are extremely uncertain .",
    "we also showed that interactions of stellar binaries are not able to sustain the large core of m10 ( @xmath35 ; harris 1996 ) even with a binary fraction as large as 10% .",
    "finally , we found that the velocity dispersion signature of an imbh in our best - fit m10 model is very challenging to detect .",
    "this is because the keplerian cusp is rather sparsely populated with bright stars and main - sequence stars with masses down to @xmath3 have to be included in a future velocity measurement in order to detect a significant increase for the innermost 20 - 40 stars . given that @xmath3 stars have been detected with only a 50% completeness in the core of m10 by @xcite _ _ , _ _ detecting such an increase _ _ remains difficult even when a second epoch of acs data with a sufficiently long time baseline becomes available .",
