    "flavor transformations caused by neutrino mixing depend on the matter background and on the neutrino fluxes themselves : neutrino - neutrino interactions provide a nonlinear term in the equations of motion  @xcite that gives rise to collective flavor transformation phenomena  .",
    "the neutrino density needs to be so large that a typical neutrino - neutrino interaction energy @xmath0 is comparable to the vacuum oscillation frequency @xmath1 .",
    "only recently has it been fully appreciated that this condition is sufficient even if a dense background of ordinary matter provides a much larger interaction energy so that naively neutrino - neutrino interactions would seem negligible  . following this crucial insight , nonlinear oscillation phenomena in the supernova ( sn ) context",
    "have been studied over the past two years in a long series of papers  .",
    "one striking effect is `` self - maintained coherence ''  @xcite .",
    "different neutrino modes have different vacuum oscillation frequencies @xmath1 , but with strong neutrino - neutrino interactions they `` stick together '' and oscillate as a single mode characterized by the `` synchronized oscillation frequency '' @xmath2 .",
    "this can lead to all modes going through an msw resonance together , the `` collective msw - like transition '' or `` synchronized msw effect ''  @xcite .",
    "more interesting still are collective phenomena driven by the decrease of the neutrino flux with distance from the source .",
    "the adiabatic transition from a dense to a dilute neutrino gas produces step - like spectral features where the spectrum sharply splits into parts of different flavor transformation , so - called `` step - wise spectral swapping '' or `` spectral splits ''  .",
    "spectral splits can result from a preceding collective msw effect ( `` msw prepared spectral split '' ) or from neutrino - neutrino interactions alone .",
    "the latter case depends on an unusual form of non - equilibrium among neutrino flavors where one has an excess of flavor pairs , say @xmath3 , over the other flavors . for neutrinos streaming off a sn core",
    "one indeed expects a hierarchy of number fluxes @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , one can have collective transformations of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 stands for some suitable combination of @xmath0 and @xmath7 neutrinos .",
    "these `` collective pair transformations '' do not violate any conservation law and thus can be catalyzed even by a very small mixing angle .",
    "@xmath8 can completely swap with @xmath9 whereas the larger @xmath10 converts only to the extent allowed by flavor - lepton conservation , but in a step - like spectral form .",
    "both the complete conversion of @xmath8 and the split in the @xmath11 spectrum provide signatures for the inverted neutrino hierarchy even for an extremely small 13-mixing angle  @xcite .    for non - isotropic enviroments",
    ", multi - angle effects may play an important role .",
    "the term `` multi - angle effects '' actually refers to two different issues .",
    "one is that the weak interaction potential between two relativistic particles is proportional to ( @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 is their relative angle of propagation .",
    "one usually considers an isotropic background of ordinary matter so that @xmath14 averages to zero .",
    "the same is true in an isotropic neutrino gas for the neutrino - neutrino term .",
    "the second issue is the `` multi - angle instability '' .",
    "neutrinos arriving from different points on the source belong to different angular modes , which may decohere kinematically in flavor space  @xcite .",
    "this effect can be self - induced in the sense that a very small initial anisotropy is enough to trigger an exponential runaway , for example in a gas consisting of equal densities of neutrinos and antineutrinos  @xcite .",
    "systems consisting of very few angular modes can show a two - stream or multi - stream instability  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical studies show that systems consisting of many angular modes and with a sufficient neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry do not show a multi - angle instability but rather show self - maintained coherence among different angular modes  @xcite .",
    "the sn neutrino flux parameters seem to be such that the multi - angle instability plays no role in practice . based on this assumption ,",
    "most of the sn studies have used the `` single - angle approximation '' , where all angular modes are assumed to have the same behavior .",
    "multi - angle effects related to the ( @xmath12 ) structure of the neutrino - neutrino term are unavoidable for an extended source radiating neutrinos into space because the emitted neutrino flux can not form an isotropic gas . however",
    ", these effects also occur , and are easier to study theoretically , in a homogeneous system evolving in time that has a non - isotropic angular distribution of neutrinos .    in practice",
    ", however , one usually deals with stationary systems where one asks for the spatial variation of a neutrino ensemble as a function of distance from the source . even if the neutrino - neutrino interaction were isotropic , we still would have geometric multi - angle effects because neutrinos reaching a certain point from an extended source have traveled on different trajectories .",
    "even the simple case of an infinite radiating plane is not trivial . here",
    "the direction perpendicular to the plane is the only direction in which the overall neutrino ensemble can show any spatial variation .",
    "even if all neutrinos have the same energy and thus oscillate with the same frequency along their trajectories , the projection on the direction perpendicular to the plane yields different effective oscillation frequencies and thus kinematical decoherence .",
    "neutrino - neutrino effects can synchronize different angular modes so that a sufficiently dense neutrino gas will not show this form of multi - angle decoherence . on the contrary",
    ", all angular modes will vary with the same oscillation length as a function of distance from the plane .",
    "a similar description applies to a spherical source where one asks for the variation of all angular modes along the radial direction .",
    "the single - angle treatment of sn neutrino oscillations amounts to the assumption of self - maintained coherence among angular modes , although it has never been explicitly expressed in this form .",
    "some authors assumed that all angular modes oscillate as the radial one  @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the neutrino - neutrino interaction vanishes because of the ( @xmath12 ) factor , so it was necessary to assume a certain average of the neutrino - neutrino interaction strength .",
    "other authors represented all angular modes by a single angular mode radiated at @xmath15 relative to the radial direction and then used a neutrino - neutrino interaction strength consistent with this assumption  @xcite .",
    "this implementation of the single - angle approximation has the advantage that one can use the same numerical code as for multi - angle simulations , simply restricting oneself to a single angular bin . in yet other cases",
    "the system was modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic gas that evolves in time , assuming a time variation of the neutrino density that mimics the radial variation in the spherical case .",
    "one of our goals is to show that the single - angle treatment can be formulated self - consistently .",
    "the assumption that all angular modes evolve the same in flavor space provides a unique concept of what is meant by `` single - angle behavior . ''",
    "this is straightforward in the systems described so far where symmetry dictates that the spatial variation is only along a certain direction , effectively reducing the problem to one dimension .",
    "we are really motivated , however , by more general geometries where no special direction is singled out by symmetry . in particular , we are interested in the case of coalescing neutron stars that may form the inner engines of short gamma - ray bursts  @xcite .    the accretion torus or disk formed during neutron star coalescence is a neutrino source comparable to a sn core . however , the torus is less dense and not efficient at producing @xmath16 and @xmath17 . therefore , the torus is a source for a dominant @xmath3 pair flux which is thought to produce an @xmath18 pair plasma , thus powering short gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the annihilation cross section for @xmath19 is much larger than that for @xmath20 , so the neutrino flavor composition strongly influences the number of @xmath21 pairs produced .",
    "therefore , one may ask if collective pair conversions occur in this environment close enough to the source to modify the energy transfer to the @xmath21 plasma , and hence affect the strength of the gamma ray burst .    for coalescing neutron",
    "stars one expects a flux hierarchy @xmath22 , which differs from the sn case because the matter leptonizes when neutrons convert to protons , in contrast to the deleptonization of a sn core .",
    "the asymmetry between @xmath10 and @xmath8 could be enough to prevent multi - angle decoherence so that similar collective effects as in the sn environment are conceivable .",
    "however , even granting this assumption , it is not straightforward how to implement something like a single - angle approximation in this context because it is not obvious how one should picture self - maintained coherence .    the purpose of our paper is to formulate the meaning of self - maintained coherence for general source geometries and study its implications .",
    "we find that the flavor variation reduces to a quasi one - dimensional problem along the streamlines of the total neutrino flux .",
    "the main difference between the general case and the radiating plane or sphere is that the streamlines are typically curved , at least close to the source , so that self - maintained coherence applies to flavor oscillations along these curved streamlines .",

    "such a description assumes that higher - order correlations beyond field bilinears play no role , probably a good approximation for neutrinos produced from essentially thermal sources such as the early - universe plasma or a sn core .",

    "we have considered a homogeneous ensemble evolving in time , largely relevant for neutrino oscillations in the early universe for which this formalism was originally developed . however , for a realistic representation of radiating objects such as supernovae or coalescing neutron stars we need to include spatial transport phenomena . to this end",
    "one introduces space - dependent occupation numbers or wigner functions @xmath45 .",
    "the quantum - mechanical uncertainty between location and momentum implies that this construction is only valid in the limit where spatial variations of the ensemble are weak on the microscopic length scales defined by the particles typical compton wavelengths .",

    "since the @xmath237 annihilation rate per unit volume decreases very rapidly far from the source ( for a spherical geometry one would expect @xmath238  @xcite ) we do not expect that these flavor transitions affect significantly the neutrino energy deposition rate in the plasma .",

    "( we have neglected the gravitational bending of trajectories . ) therefore , even if the neutrino stream has no global symmetries , the collective oscillation problem is relatively simple .",
    "we have used the concept of `` self - maintained coherence '' in the most restrictive sense that applies when the neutrino gas is dense , i.e. , when a typical neutrino - neutrino interaction energy @xmath0 is large compared to a typical vacuum oscillation frequency @xmath240 . the neutrino ensemble in this case evolves along a streamline as one unit that previously has been described as a gyroscopic pendulum in flavor space .",
    "all neutrino and anti - neutrino polarization vectors point essentially in the same direction in flavor space , the pendulum direction , allowing for the simplifications that lead to our collective equations .",
    "we have provided a prescription for defining the effective neutrino - neutrino interaction strength @xmath0 that works for general source geometries .",
    "our result is somewhat different from what was used in the previous literature , but our expression for @xmath0 agrees better with numerical simulations .",
    "there are more general forms of collective behavior . in a homogeneous isotropic system with a density that decreases adiabatically in time ,",
    "the polarization vectors are at first aligned and stay in a single co - rotating plane even when @xmath0 becomes of order @xmath98 and smaller .",
    "however , they will align or anti - align themselves in the mass direction , leading to the phenomenon of spectral splits .",
    "this is a more general case of self - maintained coherence beyond our simple picture and is analytically fully understood . in the spherically symmetric case ,",
    "numerical multi - angle simulations show a similar behavior .",
    "if the asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos is large enough to prevent multi - angle decoherence , the neutrino and antineutrino modes evolve collectively essentially along the co - rotating plane , but with intriguing three - dimensional patterns that evolve collectively and are stable in flavor space .",
    "once more spectral splits develop , similar to the single - angle approximation .",
    "we speculate that these more general forms of behavior also occur for more general source geometries if we follow the neutrino stream lines .",
    "it is clear that multi - angle decoherence will occur if the asymmetry between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos is extremely small .",
    "even a few per cent asymmetry , on the other hand , implies that close to the source we have synchronized oscillations , or , in the pendulum picture , it precesses fast without nutations .",
    "therefore , close to the source where the streamlines are curved , our treatment should be most appropriate . if the effective mixing angle is small ( as it will be because of the presence of ordinary matter ) , superficially no flavor oscillations happen close to the source and the `` true action '' begins at the synchronization radius where the inverted pendulum begins to nutate and begins to lose its initial orientation .",
    "if this point is reached at some distance , the streamlines will essentially point straight away from the source and naively one should think that henceforth the evolution is similar to the spherically symmetric case .",
    "in fact in the adiabatic approximation , one only needs to know the local value of @xmath241 in order to determine the neutrino survival probabilities , for any source geometry .    granting these assumptions",
    ", we have briefly studied a toy model for coalescing neutron stars where the source is taken to be a homogeneously radiating disk . for our numerical example , we find that the region where collective oscillations will convert the original @xmath11 and @xmath242 fluxes is quite far from the emission surface . therefore these flavor conversions should have a negligible effect on the neutrino energy deposition in the plasma .",
    "however , due to the uncertainties of the original neutrino fluxes , we can not exclude situations with a smaller asymmetry between the original fluxes .",
    "such tiny neutrino asymmetries may give rise to multi - angle decoherence , that could produce significant flavor conversions near the emitting disk .",
    "this question ultimately will need to be addressed numerically by means of large - scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor evolution near a non - spherical source , in analogy to what has been done in the case of neutrinos streaming off a sn core .",
    "our study suggests that self - maintained coherence among different neutrino modes may well be a typical form of behavior even in non - spherical systems and notably in the interesting case of coalescing neutron stars .",
