    "back in the late 80 s and early 90 s , there had been extensive work on low dimensional string theories , namely the @xmath4 non - critical ( or @xmath5 critical ) bosonic string theories , both in the discretized large @xmath6 matrix model approach  @xcite and in continuum liouville theory approach  @xcite by looking at them as @xmath3 quantum gravity coupled to @xmath7 matter .",
    "one of the motivations was to learn something about the non - perturbative effects of @xmath3 quantum gravity and string theory and to apply that knowledge to higher dimensions .",
    "studying @xmath3 gravity with simple matter was thought to be useful to probe issues of topology change in a finite and tame gravitational theory and to construct a string theoretical basis of qcd .",
    "a remarkable fact is that all the ideas of developing non - perturbative techniques using branes and dualities , string field theory _ etc .",
    "_ is now going back to matrix model . according to the recent idea , initiated in @xcite ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath1 matrix model represent unstable @xmath8-branes in the dual two - dimensional string theory . before going into the details of this idea in the context of this paper ,",
    "we describe briefly some of the difficulties in understanding @xmath1 matrix model on compact space to sketch the main motivation of this paper .    in the discrete approach ( see @xcite for review ) ,",
    "the euclidean path - integral for two dimensional gravity can be written as a sum over discretized random surfaces and is evaluated using the large @xmath6 or the planar limit of the appropriate random matrix models .",
    "however the large @xmath6 limit , the lowest order in the string perturbation theory , is not the only thing that we can extract from the expansion of the world - sheet free energy . in the continuum limit , for any genus",
    ", the area of the surface is large compared to the elementary polygons of the discretized surface .",
    "hence for any fixed genus @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ , at order @xmath10 in the @xmath11-expansion , we should stay in the vicinity of the singular point @xmath12 of the free energy at which the mean area diverges .",
    "thus the limit of interest involves large @xmath6 and small @xmath13 with @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the string susceptibility exponent ) fixed .",
    "double scaling limit _",
    "@xcite led to the solution of the matrix models to all orders in string perturbation theory .",
    "the genus expansion of the world - sheet free energy can be written as    f(n , g)=_g=0^ n^2 - 2g(g - g_c)^(1-g)(2-_str ) .",
    "also the genus expansion becomes universal , _",
    "i.e. _ almost entirely independent of how the surface is discretized .",
    "the simplest model involving integral over one matrix variable has been solved to describe pure two - dimensional gravity ( the @xmath0 case ) @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional hermitian matrix chain models have been solved in the double scaling limit and identified with the @xmath16 minimal models coupled to two - dimensional gravity @xcite . for this general case of @xmath17 minimal models",
    "coupled gravity , douglas has proposed a solution in terms of the generalized kdv equations @xcite , where the non - perturbative partition function is given by the square of the @xmath18-function of the kdv hierarchy , satisfying the string equation .",
    "the hermitian matrix quantum mechanics , describing @xmath1 theory , has been solved @xcite and is interpreted in terms of two - dimensional string theory @xcite , where the role of the extra dimension is played by the conformal factor of the world - sheet quantum gravity .",
    "the solvability of the @xmath4 matrix models of @xmath19 degrees of freedom is mainly due to the fact that only @xmath6 eigenvalues contribute , and the other @xmath20 angular degrees of freedom decouple .",
    "the @xmath21 singlet spectrum is described by @xmath6 free fermions moving in a potential .",
    "the non - singlet states , coming from the angular degrees of freedom have energy diverging as logarithm of the cut - off .",
    "so they are pushed to infinity in the continuum limit . as a result ,",
    "the singlet wave functions of the @xmath1 matrix model are sufficient to account for all physical states of the continuum string theory in a non - compact dimension , or in a circle bigger than a critical size , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this decoupling corresponds to the confinement of berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) vortices @xcite , which wind around the target space plaquette of lattice size .",
    "although each of the vortices is suppressed by a divergent action in the continuum limit , its entropy factor , given by the number of places it can be found , grows and for sufficiently small circle @xmath23 , a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition occurs . as a result , although exact results in matrix model have been proved to be very powerful in describing low dimensional string theory in uncompactified dimension , understanding physics from very small compact target space is lacking .",
    "although , for @xmath1 case , @xmath24 and the extra hidden dimension or the liouville field @xmath25 are _ a priori _ spatial dimensions , it is more convenient to continue @xmath26 , and denoting @xmath27 as the euclidean time . if we have @xmath28 wrapped on a circle , @xmath29 , we have @xmath1 string at finite temperature .    for @xmath30 ,",
    "all the @xmath19 angular degrees of freedom become relevant and the situation becomes difficult to pursue in the matrix model framework , until we understand considerably how to deal with the non - singlet states . at this moment",
    "the predictions of continuum theories for the well - understood @xmath4 cases turn out to be meaningless for @xmath30 , as the kpz - ddk formula @xcite for the string susceptibility exponent and for scaling dimensions of matter operators lead to nonphysical complex values .",
    "having said all these , the difficulties with @xmath30 models are not related to just these technical issues .",
    "the continuum approach indicates that these models are tachyonic @xcite .",
    "light - cone quantization of certain @xmath31 matrix model gave some partial results @xcite , but at the same time faces potential difficulties as the non - singlet states do not confine even if non - compact target space is considered .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to initiate an approach to deal with the less understood non - singlet sector in matrix quantum mechanics on a compact space .",
    "we develop a renormalization group ( rg ) scheme , generalizing the work of brzin and zinn - justin  @xcite on @xmath0 to the @xmath1 model on a circle .",
    "the motivation is to develop a scheme which would reasonably reproduce the known cases that are solvable and to understand , at least qualitatively , the physically interesting situations which can not be simplified because of the lack of the solvable structure . the rg analysis of the @xmath0 model , the simplest of the solvable examples , studied in @xcite has been extended to various general cases ( see for example @xcite ) . in @xcite , reparametrization invariance and the the loop equations are used to eliminate some of the induced interactions which appear in the rg transformation at higher orders in coupling .",
    "however extension of this method to matrix quantum mechanics on circle is not obvious .",
    "we instead directly generalize @xcite by explicitly evaluating the determinant obtained by integrating out part of the matrices to get a rg flow in the space of actions in general representation .",
    "this enables us to study the models which do not allow angular integration , such as the @xmath1 model on small circle , or @xmath32 matter coupled to gravity .    as an illuminating interpretation and feedback from our rg analysis",
    ", we will digress to the recent progress in understanding the dynamics of the boundaries in the @xmath3 string theory , that realizes the duality between @xmath1 model and @xmath3 quantum gravity coupled to @xmath1 matter as an exact open / closed string duality @xcite . according to this idea , the quantum mechanics of @xmath21 invariant matrix variables in an inverted oscillator potential",
    "is visualized as the quantum mechanics of open string tachyons attached to @xmath6 unstable @xmath2 branes that decays into ( _ i.e. _ dual to ) liouville theory coupled to @xmath1 matter describing @xmath3 closed string theory together with its @xmath2 branes . in matrix model",
    ", an unstable brane corresponds to a free fermion excited to the top of the potential ( in presence of the rest forming the static fermi sea ) .",
    "it then decays to the closed string vacuum by rolling down to the fermi level as an unstable eigenvalue trajectory @xmath33 the amplitude of this decay calculated by continuum methods can be read from the matrix model analysis considering the bosonization of the relativistic fermions in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "alternatively as proposed in @xcite , one can formally view the vandermonde determinant corresponding to the @xmath34-th unstable eigenvalues in presence of the rest @xmath6 , to be related to the bosonization field and thus to lead to the decay amplitude .    to understand from our rg analysis",
    ", we consider integrating out one of the eigenvalues in presence of the static fermi sea of the rest of the @xmath6 eigenvalues .",
    "the decay amplitude is shown to be contained in the change of the world - sheet free energy given by the ratio @xmath35 of the partition functions .",
    "the nice thing is that the end point of such a decay is explicitly a @xmath1 fixed point of the flow .",
    "we compute the above - mentioned vandermonde determinant , the entropy arising out of the loss of information due to integrating out one of the eigenvalues , taking the unstable eigenvalue trajectory to be that corresponding to the zz - boundary state @xcite tensored with sen s boundary state @xcite .",
    "this leads to the explicit relation between the two different views in @xcite and @xcite to compute decay amplitude and reproduces the expected time of decay @xmath36    understanding the dynamics of the boundaries in the @xmath3 string theory , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath8-objects of the boundary liouville theory , from the rg analysis of general @xmath37 matrices on a circle is much more interesting . in this case , by tuning the matrix coupling constant and the mass parameter with @xmath38 in the double scaling limit , one tunes the bulk and boundary cosmological constants respectively to arrive at a relation between the two .",
    "this is given by the integration of the flow hitting the @xmath1 fixed point .",
    "such a relation presumably represent dirichlet or neumann boundaries that are present in the liouville theory coupled to @xmath1 matter .",
    "we will show that for large circle we arrive at such trajectories with correct scaling between the two cosmological constants .",
    "however a detail analysis of such trajectories for large and small circle will be extremely interesting and will be studied in detail in a future publication .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the details of the rg calculation of matrix quantum mechanics on a circle with a cubic potential and obtain the set of beta function equations for the couplings . in section 3 , we analyze the flow , the fixed points and the critical exponents . as understood previously , the usual kpz - ddk scaling laws @xcite for @xmath39",
    "are obeyed with a logarithmic scaling violation for the @xmath1 model @xcite . with the understanding of the rg flows , here we are able to obatin the correct critical exponents of the @xmath1 strings , and to reproduce the scaling behavior for the free energy with expected scaling violation for the singlet sector .",
    "also the rg trajectory near the nontrivial fixed point shows the correct scaling behavior between the bulk and boundary cosmological constants . from the running of the prefactor of the partition function written in the renormalized couplings , analogous to the running due to the wave function renormalization",
    ", the free energy is observed to change sign near @xmath40 for small value of the critical coupling .",
    "this is reminiscent of the kosterlitz - thouless transition at self - dual radius triggered by the liberation of the world - sheet vortices . in section 4",
    ", we discuss that in what sense the rg analysis can capture the t - duality respected by the singlet partition function . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss how the change of the world - sheet free energy in integrating out one matrix eigenvalue can be seen in the recent context to lead to the amplitude of the closed string emission from the decaying brane . in section 6 ,",
    "we conclude with some open questions .",
    "the existence of _ double scaling limit _ indicates that a change in length scale induces flow in the coupling constants of the theory in a way that one reaches the continuum limit with desired critical exponents . in this continuum limit ,",
    "as the matrix coupling constant approaches a critical value @xmath41 the average number of triangles @xmath42 in triangulations at any genus @xmath9 diverges with the exponent @xmath43 while the length of the triangles or the regularized spacing of the random lattice @xmath44 is scaled to zero by taking @xmath38 to keep the physical area @xmath45 or equivalently the string coupling @xmath46 fixed ,    & & g g_c  n_g ~(1-g)(_0 - 2)(1-g / g_c)^-1 , + & & n  a ~n^- 0 , +  & & a^2 n_g ~n^- ( 1-g / g_c ) =  g_s^-2 n^2 ( g - g_c)^2-_0=. thus one would naturally try to understand how the two parameters of the theory , the size of the matrices @xmath6 and the cosmological constant ( mapped into the matrix coupling @xmath47 ) , evolve at the constant long distance physics with the rescaling of the regularization length in the triangulation of the world - sheet .",
    "the flow equations will automatically give rise to the correct scaling laws and the critical exponents around the nontrivial @xmath48 fixed points governing the continuum physics .",
    "in the wilsonian sense this can be achieved by changing @xmath49 by integrating out some of the matrix elements , which is like integrating over the momentum shell @xmath50 , and compensating it by enlarging the space of the coupling constants @xmath51 . here",
    "the space of coupling constants will contain both the matrix coupling @xmath47 and the mass parameter @xmath52 .",
    "following the rg scheme of brzin and zinn - justin we construct the flow equations by integrating out a column and a row of an @xmath53 matrix , reducing it to an @xmath54 matrix .",
    "one expects the process to lead to the following key relation satisfied by the matrix partition function    z_n+1(g , m , r ) = [ ( g , m , r)]^n^2 z_n(g,m,r ) [ lambda - scaling ] with    g & = & g + ( g , m , r)+o ( ) , + m^2 & = & m^2+(g , m , r)+o ( ) , [ beta - defn ] and    ( g , m , r)=1+r(g , m , r)+o ( ) .",

    "this is rather the behavior corresponding to the other branch of the tachyon of the liouville theory .",

    "note that in this analysis we are not looking at the @xmath148 dependence of the free energy since typically @xmath151 is very small and hence can be ignored in  ( [ cs ] )  or in  ( [ cs - scaling ] )  .",
    "alternatively , one can also consider a fixed mass parameter @xmath100 in doing the analysis .",
    "as we have discussed before in context of the analysis of the structure of the beta function equations , one can observe an indirect impact of the world sheet vortices on the free energy in the sense that it flips its sign at the self - dual radius @xmath40 .",

    "<S> motivated by the renormalization group ( rg ) approach to @xmath0 matrix model of brein and zinn - justin , we develop a rg scheme for @xmath1 matrix model on a circle and analyze how the two coupling constants in double scaling limit with critical exponent flow with the change in length scale . </S>",
