    "for many decades , thermal anemometers have been employed in a diversity of applications where the speed of a fluid ( or its gradient ) needs to be measured . in the field of",
    "turbulent flows the hot wire anemometer ( hwa ) , and particularly its constant temperature version ( cta ) , have been the preferred choice due to its excellent spatial resolution and , in the case of the latter , its unchallenged frequency response .",
    "some of the disadvantages of the hwa are its fragility the wire diameter is typically about @xmath3m and its susceptibility to surface contamination , which makes necessary frequent calibrations to maintain its accuracy .",
    "for industrial applications we find a variant of the hwa in which the heating element is covered with a protective ceramic or other appropriate material , to avoid damage of the heating element by chemical compounds or solid particles .",
    "the latter type of device is adequate for applications demanding a robust probe , like outdoor measuring of wind speed , or airspeed measuring in wind tunnels or other devices for monitoring / control purposes . due to the protective covering ,",
    "the thermal mass of these probes is bigger , and the thermal conductivity of the heating element to the surroundings is smaller .",
    "therefore , a wide frequency response can not be expected from this type of probe .",
    "nevertheless , in the constant temperature mode a bandwidth up to @xmath4  hz is achievable , as we will find out later .",
    "other types of probes for thermal anemometry will be briefly mentioned in the appendix [ ap_a ] .",
    "the remaining parts of this article are organized as follows : in section [ theory ] we will depict the theoretical aspects required for the design of a working cta , starting with the justification for using a proportional - integral ( pi ) controller , and give the results of some simulations . in section [ ec ]",
    "the schematic diagram of the electronic circuit of the servo - controller , which is nothing more than the physical realization of the dynamical equations of the section [ theory ] , will be presented . in section [ m_e ] details for the construction of the probe",
    "are given , while the results of the tests performed on the constructed device are given is section [ test ] .",
    "lastly , in section [ concl ] the conclusions are given .",
    "the theory of thermal anemometers is well known , so that we will adopt a mostly practical approach , paying attention mainly to aspects related to our specific goal .",
    "initially , and for a long time , commercial and laboratory ctas used proportional controllers to keep a constant sensor temperature .",
    "today , some models using a pi controller can be acquired in the market .",
    "this type of controller can also be found in new developments , like the constant bandwidth cta reported by ligeza.@xcite the design described here also makes use of a pi controller . at first glance",
    ", the utilization of a pi controller seems to be a complication , because a proportional controller appears as being the simplest option to implement a servomechanism .",
    "in fact , that is not always the case .",
    "the reason is that a proportional controller needs a huge gain in order to attain a small error .",
    "even if a thermal anemometer with proportional controller is carefully calibrated prior to use , its inherently imperfect bridge balance will lead to errors in the working temperature and , consequently , in the speed measurement .",
    "thus , a high gain is mandatory to obtain a small error , and imposes the utilization of fast electronics .",
    "this aspect was studied by freymuth,@xcite who in addition showed that the system of differential equations governing the whole system is of third order due to the two main poles usually found in voltage amplifiers .",
    "indeed , the order can be even higher , depending on the number of cascaded stages used in the amplifier circuit .",
    "this is due to the upper bound in the gain - bandwidth product inherent to every voltage - gain stage of any amplifier .",
    "thus , the higher the number of stages in the amplifier , the higher the number of poles and , consequently , the order of the governing equations .",
    "a third ( or higher ) order system with high gain , working in closed loop , will almost certainly be prone to instability , requiring compensating networks to avoid instabilities and , hopefully , obtain a critically damped system . in his development of an algorithm for deriving the transfer functions of hot - wire ctas of arbitrary complexity , watmuff@xcite states that insufficient amplifier bandwidth is one of the primary sources of instability in hot wire anemometers . in the discussion that follows it",
    "is implicitly assumed that , for small perturbations around the equilibria , the anemometer can be seen as a linear system .",
    "it is in that context that the terminology of linear control systems is used .    in the present application ,",
    "the controller goal is to maintain a perfectly balanced wheatstone bridge , at least within a frequency band useful for wind speed measurements and wind tunnel control . due to its operating principle , a first order controller that can perform",
    "that task is the pi controller .",
    "there are two reasons that justify this choice . on the one hand ,",
    "the integral stage allows for a perfect balance of the bridge for static , or quasi - static inputs . on the other hand ,",
    "the proportional stage compensates the unbalance coming from varying inputs with moderate bandwidth , without the need of a huge gain , because the quasi - static part of the error is already compensated by the integral stage .",
    "given that moderate gains for the amplifiers are enough in this configuration , the contribution of their poles to the controller transfer function is negligible .",
    "thus , the only relevant derivatives in the governing equations are those resulting from the integrator and the thermal response of the probe , which have also a first order dynamics . in other words , we need to deal only with a second order system , which is simpler than the third ( or higher ) order system resulting from a high gain proportional controller .",
    "we must stress that this somewhat paradoxical result is due simply to the fact that the bandwidth limitations in the amplifier of a proportional controller come into play owing to the need of a high gain .",
    ", while the voltage applied to the bridge , @xmath5 , is the output .",
    "the rate of heat flow @xmath6 is provided by the joule dissipation at the probe resistor , while @xmath7 represents the rate of heat flow towards the surroundings at temperature @xmath8 , through the thermal resistance @xmath9 , whose value depends on @xmath10 .",
    "( b ) schematic diagram of the wheatstone bridge , showing the relationship between components and voltages ( see text ) . ]",
    "figure [ one](a ) displays a block diagram of the thermal anemometer .",
    "there , @xmath10 is the wind speed , and plays the role of system input , whereas @xmath5 is the voltage applied to the bridge , and also the system output .",
    "figure [ one](b ) shows the details of the wheatstone bridge , where @xmath11 is the probe . for maximum sensitivity",
    ", one should have @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the resistor @xmath14 represents the resistance of the cable that connects the probe to the bridge .",
    "its resistance can degrade the anemometer performance to an unacceptable level , so that it must be minimized as much as possible .",
    "the variable resistor @xmath15 compensates the cable resistance , restoring the operating temperature of the probe to the desired value .",
    "its resistance must be set to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is equal to the probe resistance at the operating temperature .",
    "note that the input @xmath10 modulates the thermal resistance @xmath18 , which is a system parameter that controls the rate of heat flow @xmath19 leaving the probe towards the thermal reservoir @xmath20 .",
    "thus , in thermal anemometers the input is parametrically coupled to the system .",
    "next , the rate of heat flow @xmath21 entering the probe is provided by the wheatstone bridge as a fraction of the power generated by @xmath5 . again , this interaction is parametric , and quadratic in @xmath5 .",
    "thus , this system will be governed by a system of two non linear , first order equations , with parametric coupling .",
    "we will solve it by using numerical integration .",
    "let us start with the well known equation for the probe thermal balance : the electrical power entering the probe , and the rate of heat flow leaving the probe towards the surrounding air , determine the rate of change in the probe temperature .",
    "if @xmath22 is the probe heat capacity and @xmath23 its temperature , then @xmath24 .",
    "assuming that the probe resistance changes linearly with the temperature , we have @xmath25 with @xmath26 constant .",
    "this probe is connected to the controller through a cable , which must be chosen as short as possible . as this anemometer",
    "is designed to measure mainly the mean value of the airspeed , or at most fluctuations in a rather low frequency band , the cable inductance and capacitance are not of concern .",
    "however , the cable resistance could be a problem , given the low value of the probe resistance .",
    "thus , in our equations we will consider the cable resistance , @xmath14 . now , let @xmath27 be the thermal conductance to the surroundings when the wind speed is @xmath28 . then , given that @xmath29 is the voltage applied to the bridge , we have @xmath30 where @xmath17 is the bridge resistor in series with the probe , @xmath23 is the probe temperature , and @xmath20 is the air temperature at a distance much larger than the size of the probe . let @xmath31 be the bridge imbalance voltage , or error voltage . the pi controller output , which is also the voltage applied to the bridge ,",
    "is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the resistances of the resistors in the reference arm of the bridge , as shown in figure [ one](b ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the proportional and integral gains , respectively , and include the gains of the amplifiers a@xmath39 and a@xmath40 . equations ( [ probe ] ) through ( [ verr ] ) govern the system dynamics , and the anemometer response can be optimized by adjusting the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 . replacing @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) and taking the derivative , we obtain a first order equation that involves only the voltage @xmath5 . after some straightforward algebra , and defining @xmath41 , \\label{teq}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 , we obtain the dynamical equations for the thermal anemometer with a pi controller :    [ dyneq ] @xmath43 @xmath44    note that the exact form of the thermal conductance @xmath45 is not relevant : if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the thermal conductances at zero and maximum speeds , respectively , small departures of @xmath45 from the ideal thermal conductance function , while keeping the mapping of the input speed range on the interval @xmath48 $ ] , will give essentially the same results .",
    "given that this system is nonlinear , optimization can not be achieved on the whole operating range unless an adaptive controller is used .",
    "our approach was to optimize the anemometer for some speed @xmath28 , @xmath49 , to obtain an acceptable behavior within the entire operating range .",
    "m / s and a square fluctuation of amplitude @xmath50  m / s for two settings of the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "( a ) the measured wind speed displays an underdamped response ( u , blue ) when @xmath51 and @xmath52 , whereas an overdamped response ( o , magenta ) is obtained when @xmath51 and @xmath53 . in ( b ) , a plot of the corresponding fluctuations in the probe temperature is displayed . in the optimal case ,",
    "@xmath54 should be constant .",
    "( c ) for @xmath55 and @xmath52 the response seems to be nearly optimal .",
    "the fluctuation amplitude of @xmath54 ( d ) is a fifth of the amplitude of the curves displayed in ( b ) . ]    to solve the equations ( [ dyneq ] ) , the bulirsh - stoer method@xcite can be used . to obtain a reference behavior ,",
    "let us consider the ideal case with @xmath56 .",
    "the input signal will represent a wind with average speed @xmath57  m / s , and a superimposed square wave of amplitude @xmath58  m / s . to control the steepness of the transitions between the two wind levels",
    ", the square wave can be approximated using a smooth function , @xmath59 , \\label{wind}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the period , and @xmath61 is the steepness parameter .",
    "thus , the system input is given by @xmath62 .",
    "three solutions of the equations ( [ dyneq ] ) , obtained using three parameter settings , are displayed in the figure [ fwind ] .",
    "the curves in subplot [ fwind](a ) represent the speed theoretically measured by the anemometer for a wind having mean speed of @xmath63  m / s , with a symmetric square wave fluctuation of amplitude @xmath64  m / s .",
    "the input wind speed is represented by the square signal ( w , red ) .",
    "the curve showing under damped response ( u , blue ) results with a parameter setting @xmath51 and @xmath52 , while the overdamped response ( o , magenta ) is obtained when @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding thermal responses of the probe are displayed in the subplot [ fwind](b ) .",
    "we see that in both cases the probe temperature deviates from the working temperature by about @xmath65  k. when @xmath55 and @xmath52 , a nearly critical damping is obtained , as displayed in subplot [ fwind](c ) , where the input and measured winds are almost superposed . in this case ,",
    "as shown in subplot [ fwind](d ) , the probe temperature deviates from the working value by only about @xmath66  k , an amount five times smaller than those in the two previous cases . in principle , by increasing even more both , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , an even better response should be obtained .",
    "the problem is that our model does not take into account the limitations of the operational amplifiers .",
    "thus , what could appear as a nearly perfect performance in the model  when the parameter are set at very large values  can result in practice in a potentially destructive oscillation .",
    "if the parameter values used to obtain the critically damped response are held fixed , and the mean speed of the wind is changed , a small change in the response is observed . with a mean wind speed of @xmath67  m / s the overall system response improves .",
    "the measured speed follows more closely the square wave , and the deviations of the probe temperature are smaller .",
    "contrarily , when the mean wind speed is reduced to only @xmath68  m / s , an overshot of about @xmath69% appears in the measured speed , and the deviation of the probe temperature is about @xmath70  k , that is , around @xmath71 times larger than that observed when the mean speed is @xmath63  m / s .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of the cta , and is due mainly to the dependence of the probe - ambient thermal conductivity on the wind speed .    in the previous simulations",
    "the effect of the cable resistance , @xmath14 , was neglected .",
    "this is not a problem when @xmath14 is much smaller than the resistance of the sensor .",
    "however , for @xmath14 values about 20% the probe resistance , the degradation of the anemometer performance can be unacceptable .",
    "this problem is effectively solved by the variable resistor @xmath15 in series with @xmath36 .",
    "simulations using @xmath72  @xmath73 and a value of @xmath15 calculated using the equation ( [ rcomp ] ) give results practically identical to those obtained with @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , the results can not be exactly the same : although the compensating resistor @xmath15 restores the operating temperature of the probe , the presence of @xmath14 and @xmath15 degrade the bridge sensitivity .",
    "this reduces the loop gain , and the signal to noise ratio .",
    "a schematic diagram of the electronic circuit is displayed in the figure [ elec ] .",
    "the wheatstone bridge consists of four resistors , @xmath35 through @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the sensor .",
    "the resistances of the reference arm are @xmath75  k@xmath73 , while on the probe arm the upper resistance is @xmath76  @xmath73 , which is the resistance value to be attained by the sensor at the working temperature ( or equilibrium point ) .",
    "thus , at the equilibrium point the voltage at the nodes in each arm will be half the voltage applied to the upper node of the bridge .",
    "the controller has three stages : the first one is a difference amplifier , u1a , which amplifies the bridge output .",
    "this voltage the error voltage is multiplied by ten and delivered to the second stage , or pi stage , where it is amplified by u1b and simultaneously integrated by u1c .",
    "these voltages are added in the third stage , u1d , and current boosted by a darlington transistor , q1 .",
    "this stage is simply a unity gain voltage amplifier with increased current source  but not sink  capability .",
    "finally , the emitter of q1 is connected to the upper node of the bridge , thus closing the loop .",
    "diode d2 limits the negative excursion of the output of u1d to @xmath77  v. this prevents the application of large negative voltages to the base of q1 during the power - on transient .",
    "the diode d1 has also a limiting function , preventing large positive voltages at the output of the integrator .",
    "if such condition is allowed , then the anemometer could remain latched in a state where the proportional stage in unable to deliver enough voltage to counteract the integrator output , and the bridge would never become energized .",
    "a resistor can optionally be placed in parallel with the pass transistor q1 . in the schematic diagram",
    "it is designated as @xmath78 .",
    "this resistor is useful when a small offset voltage makes the output of u1a negative , which locks the circuit in a state in which the bridge voltage remains null . under such condition",
    ", the resistor @xmath78 must provide enough current through the bridge for trespassing the @xmath79 equilibrium point towards the unstable branch . from here",
    ", the bridge voltage should transit to the next stable point , where the voltage at the nodes of both arms is half the voltage applied to the upper node of the bridge .",
    "note that when a proportional controller is used , the resistor @xmath78 introduces a systematic error in the cta output . in the case of the pi controller , this error is automatically compensated by the integrator .     in its reference arm",
    "compensates the resistance @xmath80 of the cable connecting the probe to the bridge . ]",
    "this cta is based on a heater made of a non inductive winding of awg  @xmath81 magnet wire .",
    "the idea is to take advantage of its electrically isolating film to protect the conducting element .",
    "this requires a low working temperature to avoid burning the coating .",
    "thus , we chose a temperature close to @xmath82c .",
    "this temperature is well below the maximum allowed temperature for common enamel types , although for long durability at least a thermal class @xmath83c nema mw 30-c insulation should be used . to minimize the inductance of the probe , the winding was double - strand wound by hand around a hypodermic needle of diameter @xmath84  mm , to obtain a winding length of @xmath85  mm . a hollow cylinder made of @xmath65  mm thick copper sheet",
    "was used to enclose the winding and homogenize the temperature to avoid hot spots .",
    "high temperature silicone was used to fill the inner volume and improve the thermal contact between the wire and the enclosure .",
    "figure [ anem ] displays the arrangement of metal components making the probe .",
    "several cuts were made to the different parts to show the inner structure .",
    "the resistance of the finished probe at ambient temperature was @xmath86 , whereas at the working temperature of @xmath82c @xmath87 . in the finished probe",
    "the winding is completely covered by the copper tube .",
    ") , while the filled circles correspond to the measured data .",
    "( b ) in this case , the gain of the controller and the cable resistance were reduced to improve the system stability .",
    "more points were used in the low speed range , starting at @xmath88  m / s . here",
    ", the continuous curve represents a fit using a fifth degree polynomial . ]",
    "the anemometer was tested using a square jet with section @xmath89  cm  @xmath90  cm , with a turbulence level of about @xmath91% .",
    "the parameter values were those of the components in the figure [ elec ] , giving loop gain values @xmath92 and @xmath93 . a rotating vane anemometer was used to measure the airspeed of the jet .",
    "the measurements were made within a speed interval from @xmath84  m / s through @xmath94  m / s .",
    "the plot in figure [ klp](a ) displays the speed measured with the vane anemometer , along with the calibration curve obtained by fitting the king s law to the bridge voltage .",
    "if @xmath29 denotes the bridge voltage and @xmath28 is the jet airspeed , then @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are the fitting parameters .",
    "the expression in equation ( [ kl ] ) can be inverted to obtain the airspeed @xmath28 as a function of the bridge voltage @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , when the measurements are to be done in a restricted speed range , the calibration accuracy can be improved by fitting the inverse function @xmath99 the plot in figure [ klp](b ) represents a calibration using reduced loop gains .",
    "the cable resistance was also reduced . in this case",
    "we expect a reduction in the bandwidth along with an increase in the loop stability . in this case , a fifth degree polynomial was used to fit the data , giving less error than the king s law .",
    "figure [ spectrum ] displays the spectrum of the velocity signal measured by the anemometer .",
    "as can be seen , the curve approximately follows a straight line having a slope @xmath100 , which corresponds to the kolmogorov spectrum of a turbulent velocity field . at first sight",
    ", this finding could seem rather surprising , given the characteristic sizes of the probe .",
    "in fact , the measurement was made with the main component of the velocity perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the probe , whose diameter and length are @xmath101  mm and @xmath102  mm , respectively . by using the taylor hypothesis and the biggest probe dimension",
    ", we can estimate the cutoff frequency of this probe in a wind of @xmath103  m / s , impinging orthogonally on the probe .",
    "the results is @xmath104  hz .",
    "of course , this is roughly the maximum geometric cutoff .",
    "as the thermal inertia also plays a role , what we see in reality is a frequency response limited by the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the roll - off near @xmath4  hz in the figure [ spectrum ] is related to the filter used to suppress the high frequency noise . without this filter ,",
    "what we have is a spectrum that becomes nearly flat beyond @xmath4  hz , contributing with nothing but noise to the anemometer output .        in the previous test ,",
    "the parameter values were those defined by the values of the components in the figure [ elec ] , giving loop gain values @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this setting worked like the simulation in the first anemometer we built . however , in the second one an oscillation was observed .",
    "this was corrected by reducing the value of the integral gain .",
    "lastly , there is an aspect which is not directly related to the measurement performance , but must be necessarily considered : it is the power consumption .",
    "most of the electric power is dissipated by the arm of the bridge that conducts the probe current .",
    "in fact , from the total electrical current that circulates through the circuit , only a very small fraction is required for the controller operation .",
    "to obtain an estimate of the power required to keep the probe at a given temperature , 2d simulations using the finite elements method were performed .",
    "these allowed to know the rate of heat flow towards the surroundings at several airspeeds . in particular , at @xmath105  m / s the resulting power requirement was @xmath106  w , which is not too far from the measured value . from the calibration data displayed in the figure [ klp ] ,",
    "it can be deduced that at @xmath105  m / s the power dissipated by the probe is @xmath107  w. in the design reported here , the bridge and the controller power supplies are separated .",
    "this prevents the possibility of couplings between voltage fluctuations in the bridge supply and the controller supply .",
    "the path followed by most of the current delivered to the bridge is formed by the pass transistor , @xmath108 , and the resistors @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath11 . under normal operation , @xmath109 .",
    "if we neglect the cable resistance , we see that the the probe arm of the bridge has a resistance given simply by @xmath110  @xmath73 .",
    "the other arm has essentially a resistance @xmath111  k@xmath73 , so that the power it dissipates is four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the probe arm .",
    "of course , the power dissipated by the anemometer will depend on the wind speed , and the voltage delivered by the power supply .",
    "figure [ pow ] displays the power consumption of the bridge , the power dissipated by the pass transistor , @xmath108 , and the power dissipated by the probe , @xmath11 , as functions of the wind speed @xmath28 .",
    "the supply voltage is @xmath112  v. the probe power is half that of the bridge , and the power dissipated by the transistor is relatively constant .",
    "we see that the values of the power dissipation are not small , so that adequate heat sinks must be used for the transistor @xmath108 and the resistor @xmath17 .",
    "both must be rated to support levels of power greater than the maximum they must manage .",
    "v. at @xmath105  m / s the total power consumption is @xmath113  w. the dissipation in the pass transistor , @xmath108 , is @xmath114  w in the entire range of wind speeds .",
    "the power dissipated by the probe and @xmath17 are the same , between @xmath115  w and @xmath116  w in the displayed airspeed interval . ]     +",
    "we have designed and built a thermal anemometer appropriate for measurements of airspeeds from @xmath65  m / s through @xmath117  m / s within a frequency band from @xmath118  hz through @xmath4  hz . its main advantage , as compared with hot - wire anemometers ,",
    "is its robustness .",
    "this makes it especially adequate for outdoor measurements , in instances where the measuring of small scale turbulence is not required .",
    "it can also be used for closed loop control of the airspeed in wind tunnels .",
    "of course , given that it works at low temperature , a simultaneous measurement of the air temperature is mandatory in order to correctly calculate the wind speed .",
    "thus , a complete anemometric system based on this anemometer would comprise , in addition , a thermometer based on a calibrated thermistor or a thermocouple , and a two channel digitizer connected to a micro - controller or a pc , to perform the required real time computations .",
    "of course , when the air temperature is known and constant , after a calibration it can be used without the need of temperature correction .",
    "financial support for this work was provided by fondecyt grant no .",
    "1090686 , and dicyt - usach project no .",
    "a number probes based on the thermal conduction of heat to the surrounding fluid can be found in the literature .",
    "we will not consider here the hot wire , because the motivation of this work was precisely avoiding its use for monitoring and/or flow control purposes , given its fragility .",
    "nevertheless , the interested reader will find an excellent account of its principles and applications in the book by bruun.@xcite an excellent review of thermal anemometry , including hot film probes , is given by fingerson.@xcite    virtually every electrical device capable of power dissipation can be used to implement a thermal anemometer , as long as one of its electrical parameters exhibits a noticeable  and strictly monotonous ",
    "dependence on the temperature . in this respect ,",
    "the negative temperature coefficient ( ntc ) thermistor is possibly the device of choice : its resistance roughly changes as the exponential of the reciprocal of the temperature .",
    "this is probably the reason why relatively soon after its introduction in the marketplace , thermal anemometers based on thermistors were developed and studied.@xcite when used to measure temperature , thermistors appear to be quite stable.@xcite in a thermal anemometer , they may have to withstand substantial amounts of current and power , possibly at an elevated temperature .",
    "this could degrade the characteristics of the device in a relatively short time , depending on the operating conditions .",
    "also , due to the dependence of the resistance on the absolute temperature @xmath23 , we have @xmath119 , so that at higher temperatures the signal to noise ratio worsens . for a thermal anemometer ,",
    "the basic idea is to apply an electrical current so that the thermistor is self heated by joule dissipation .",
    "next , the operating mode will depend on the parameter that is held constant . at constant current",
    ", the fluid flow induces changes in the voltage drop between the terminals .",
    "the changes in this voltage inversely correlate with the changes in the flow speed .",
    "conversely , at constant voltage the changes in the current inversely correlate with the changes in the flow speed .",
    "these are the two `` passive '' operating modes .",
    "a third realizable possibility is keeping constant the temperature .",
    "this , of course , requires a servo controller .",
    "the advantage of the latter mode is that  ideally  the thermal inertia of the probe plays no role .",
    "thus , with an optimal servo controller , the response time is not penalized by heating or cooling times , contrary to what happen in the two former operating modes .",
    "of course , these three principles can be applied to every thermal anemometer , not only to those based on the ntc thermistor .",
    "now , in this particular probe the sensing element is normally encapsulated in glass , adding a thermal resistance in series to the thermal resistance between the surface of the enclosure an the surrounding fluid .",
    "this degrades the response time of the sensor : it introduces a time constant in exact analogy to adding an rc low - pass filter at the input of an amplifier . for monitoring of fluctuating flow speeds",
    ", this can go from innocuous through disastrous , depending on the value of the time constant .",
    "commercial thermistors come in several formats .",
    "the fastest ones have no enclosure , and the bead size can be about @xmath120 m .",
    "their time constant in still air can be about @xmath121  s. their terminals have a diameter of about @xmath122 m , so that they are fragile .",
    "in addition , they can not dissipate large amounts of power , and their working temperature can not be very high .",
    "they have been used for low speed measurements in liquids .",
    "larger thermistors are robust , but their thermal time constant in still air can be as large as @xmath123  s. of course , when the surrounding air is in motion , the response can be much faster .",
    "for example , a microthermistor with a @xmath124 m bead can respond to turbulent temperature fluctuations above @xmath91  khz when the mean speed of the airflow is about @xmath125  m / s .",
    "these facts have implication for the operation of thermal anemometers .",
    "the bandwidth of any thermal anemometer depends on the mean speed of the fluid .",
    "in fact , this problem is even worse , because the dependence in the flow speed implies that the probe has nonsymmetric heating and cooling rates . at low flow speed ,",
    "the cooling rate is also low , whereas the heating rate is determined essentially by the power source . in pulsating flows",
    "this can be a serious problem .",
    "of course , an enclosure with high thermal resistance makes this problem even worse . nevertheless , within reasonable limits , thermal anemometers based on thermistor can be designed to meet specific requirements .",
    "examples of thermistor - based anemometers can be found in the works by murphy and sparks,@xcite and martino and mcnall jr.@xcite    resistive temperature detectors ( rtds ) have been extensively used to implement thermal anemometers .",
    "perhaps their main advantage is a nearly linear dependence of the resistance on the temperature .",
    "their drawback is that they are less sensitive to temperature changes .",
    "nevertheless , they can be used at higher temperatures .",
    "this allows measurements less sensitive to the fluid temperature , provided that the difference between the working temperature of the cta probe and the fluid temperature is large enough .",
    "for example , the working temperature of a hot wire cta probe is typically about @xmath126c , which gives a difference of some @xmath127c when the fluid is air at room temperature .",
    "the platinum or tungsten wires used in hwas fall in the rtd category , as well as the probe made of enameled copper wire reported here .",
    "commercial , platinum based rdts designed to be used as thermometers , have been used in thermal anemometers .",
    "the well known pt100 probe has been used in thermal anemometers and flow meters by several groups .",
    "see for example the work by miete and ray @xcite , where the performances of pt100 , and p - n junction based flow meters are assessed .",
    "the pt100 sensor comes in several formats , like bars or chips , allowing their use in a variety of applications .",
    "it is characterized by a resistance @xmath128 at @xmath129c . at @xmath130c ,",
    "its resistance is @xmath131 . around @xmath130c ,",
    "we have that the change per k in the platinum resistance is @xmath132% , whereas in the probe reported here it is @xmath133% .",
    "thus , the copper probe is @xmath125% more sensitive than the pt100 probe , which should contribute to a slight improvement in the signal to noise ratio . as shown in section [ test ] , the probe reported here seems to respond well up to @xmath1  hz , according to the spectrum in figure [ spectrum ] .",
    "this is due in part to the low thermal resistance between the surrounding air and the heating element .",
    "in fact , the enameled copper wire is physically in contact with the copper enclosure , even so , high temperature silicone was added to further increase the thermal conductance .",
    "also , as mentioned in section [ m_e ] , the copper enclosure homogenizes the temperature along the probe .",
    "these two characteristics should contribute to a faster response of the copper probe .",
    "the ceramic enclosure has a lower thermal conductance than the copper enclosure , which leads to two degrading effects : i ) the thermal coupling between the surrounding air and the heating element is weaker ; and ii ) axial thermal gradients could exist obeying to the same reason , degrading even more the probe performance . for probes of each type having the same geometry , the response time will be determined in the first place by the thermal mass of each probe , and the internal thermal resistance can add an additional lag , depending on how large its value is .",
    "a quantitative assessment of the possible advantages or drawbacks of each one of these probes is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "clearly , an extensive program of testing should be necessary to establish the application fields where each probe could perform better .",
