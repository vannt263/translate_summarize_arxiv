    "nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) is a universal model which applies to deep - water waves , nonlinear optics , plasma physics and bose - einstein condensates among others@xcite .",
    "it is an integrable partial differential equation which gives us access to a set of powerful mathematical techniques@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is based on a narrow - band approximation ( i.e.  derived by means of the slowly - varying envelope approximation or the method of multiple scales ) ; many extensions were proposed to describe different situations and phenomena .",
    "particularly , in hydrodynamics , where the wave steepness of the carrier plays the role of perturbation parameter , nearly 40 years ago a fourth - order generalization of the nls was proposed in @xcite .",
    "we denote this model high - order nls ( honls ) . the main drive to develop such a model was to better explain the properties of the the ubiquitous benjamin - feir instability ( bfi ) @xcite , i.e.  the well - known growth of oscillations on top of a uniform stokes wave .",
    "the spectral downshift observed in bfi @xcite can be often explained in the honls framework .",
    "however , in the last decades much effort has been devoted to characterize the properties of this model and to include other effects , such as viscosity or wind @xcite .",
    "as far as the mathematical properties of the honls are concerned , we recall that the conventional reference frame change , which allows one to write a time - like honls ( where the evolution variable is space ) , leads to two different forms : the equation describing the evolution of the envelope of the surface elevation ( thereafter denoted honlse ) and the one pertaining to the envelope of the velocity potential ( honlsp ) .",
    "the former possesses less conservation laws than the latter : this is a consequence of the choice of canonical variables @xcite .",
    "nevertheless those variables can be less accessible from an experimental point of view .",
    "no matter which form we consider , the honls exhibits nearly perfect recurrence of the initial state ( a hint of an underlying integrable evolution ) ; the conventional wisdom is that during this cyclic behavior the spectral peak is downshifted while the spectral mean is upshifted @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will study the behavior of recurrence in the two forms of honls and characterize the origin of the temporary peak downshift . after having recalled in section [ sec : honls ] the main properties of the model , we present ( section [ sec : cmt ] ) a three - wave truncation @xcite , by means",
    "of which we find a closed form for the equations which rule the nonlinear behavior of bfi , obtain an approximate one - degree - of - freedom phase space , where the evolution of experimental quantities can be mapped onto , and clarify what a sound definition of spectral shift should be .",
    "this approach proved effective in other nearly - integrable systems @xcite , where exact solutions can not be costructed .",
    "this is the case of honls : the akhmediev breather @xcite , the peregrine soliton @xcite , conventionally regarded as prototypes of rogue waves @xcite , only represent approximate solutions @xcite .",
    "the non - integrability appears nevertheless to be an important ingredient for the appearance of extreme events ( e.g.  in optical fibers @xcite ) .",
    "let us start from the normalized time - like honls@xcite @xmath0+\\beta g[a]+h[a]\\right\\ } ,       \\label{eq : dysthe1}\\ ] ] where the adimensional quantities are obtained from dimensional ones as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the complex envelope of surface elevation , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are time and propagation distance in a frame moving at the group velocity of the carrier wave .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath7 is chosen by setting a value of the steepness @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the carrier wave - number .",
    "finally @xmath10 , @xmath11 with @xmath12 the angular frequency of the wave in the limit of infinitely deep water .",

    "@xmath19 is used to distinguish the honlse ( @xmath20 ) from the honlsp ( @xmath21)@xcite . this latter conserves not only the norm @xmath22 ( the only conserved quantity of honlse ) , but also the momentum @xmath23 and the hamiltonian @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26_\\tau\\right ] { \\mathrm{d}}\\tau}$ ] .",
    "we find it useful to briefly recall the properties of the full nonlinear evolution of bfi after the initial exponential growth phase .",
    "since the excitation of a harmonically perturbed stokes wave represents a good approximation of the akhmediev breather , we solve the honlse with initial condition @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , i.e. the frequency of maximum instability growth , which depends only on the @xmath17 $ ] contribution @xcite ( see also the derivation below ) .",

    "fig : dysthe1](b ) , which corresponds to the sideband unbalance @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the fourier - transform of @xmath39 ) ; ( ii ) the second order sidebands start growing due to four - wave mixing ; this effect is unbalanced towards @xmath40 ( so that the spectral mean grows ) and contributes to the opposite - side unstable mode ( @xmath41 ) via four - wave mixing , thus we observe a peak downshift as soon as the stokes wave is overcome by the unstable modes ; ( iii ) at maximum conversion the process reverses to the initial perturbed plane wave .    in fig .

    "we can derive an integral expression for the evolution of this quantity as : @xmath42 with @xmath43 .    if @xmath33 changes sign and unstable sidebands dominate over the stokes wave , we can state that the spectral peak has shifted , so this variable describes what is the experimental peak frequency",

    "this consolidates the view that a definition of spectral shift can not rely on the spectral peak position : this in turn depends on the definition of the reference frame ( a correction of group velocity ) rather than on dynamical effects ( the privileged direction of four - wave mixing , which on average points towards higher frequencies ) .",
    "the correct definition of ( here temporary ) up(down)-shift must thus rely on the @xmath34 dynamics , which is notably appropriately described even by our low - dimensional approximation .",
    "the inclusion of more fourier components ( we verified it in the five - wave truncation ) only slightly improves the approximation : the kinematic effect depends thus on a complex interplay of many ( but not all ) stable and unstable modes , while the spectral shift is a global average property . as shown above , by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : dysthe1 ] and [ fig : dysthe2 ] , for a smaller bfi gain the conversion to higher - order modes is smaller and the upshift is dominant , consistently with our analysis .",
    "we analyzed a low - dimensional truncation of the so - called dysthe equation in its two versions : the one which conserves only the norm ( envelope honls ) and the one which conserves also momentum and hamiltonian ( potential honls ) .",
    "this latter naturally reduces to a one degree - of - freedom integrable hamiltonian system , while the former includes a closed - form non - resonant perturbation which breaks the integrability , but not the heteroclinic behavior .",
    "this low dimensional ( albeit non - integrable ) system of odes permits to model correctly the _ spectral upshift _ in the spectral - mean sense of the nonlinear stage of bfi and to distinguish it from other kinematic corrections , which manifest themselves as a frequency downshift .",
    "while we could think to eliminate the term breaking the integrability of the system by means of a gauge transformation @xcite , this complicates however the analysis and the comparison to experimental results .",
    "this approach is general and can be applied to other corrections of the nls and honls , such as linear or nonlinear gain or dissipation , in order to ease the interpretation of the complex experimental data collected in the hundred meter long wave - tanks which are being currently developed .",
