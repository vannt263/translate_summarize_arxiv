    "we perform several simple diagnostics to determine whether the sample of _ swift _ grbs without redshifts contains an overwhelming number of bright , low-@xmath0 bursts . to simplify analysis",
    ", we consider a sample of bursts that meet the `` detectability '' criteria of @xcite ( in particular , low galactic extinction and quick _ swift _ localization ) , a set of 50 grbs with a confirmed @xmath0 and 47 without . with this set , using the procedure of sect .",

    ". a two - sample k - s test between the @xmath0@xmath132 and @xmath0-less sets reveals that they are incompatible at @xmath6170% . limiting the @xmath0@xmath132 set only to grbs with @xmath30@xmath3210@xmath44  erg  s@xmath10 , this increases to @xmath6199% .",
    "while not conclusive , these results could be interpreted as most @xmath0-less bursts being either at high @xmath0 , in which case our evolution may be _ underestimated _ , or at low @xmath0 with lower intrinsic luminosities , which may not survive our @xmath30 cut .",
    "additionally , we examine the fractions of grbs detected by _ swift _",
    "s uv - optical telescope in the _ swift _ archive . of bursts with a known @xmath0 ,",
    "34 were seen by uvot with @xmath62 , while the 16 not seen have @xmath63 .",
    "bursts lacking redshifts seem more consistent with the high-@xmath0 set , with only 8/47 seen by uvot .    we also consider whether the fraction of observable bursts , @xmath14@xmath1@xmath64 , is somehow _ increasing _ with @xmath0 . while @xmath65 is difficult to quantify , our selection criteria disfavor incompleteness of our sample at low @xmath0 .",
    "we focus upon the probability of determining a redshift for a given grb , which we subdivide as @xmath66@xmath1@xmath67 .",
    "perhaps the most obvious influence on this term is the fact that at low @xmath0 , most redshifts are determined by observing emission lines ( from the host galaxy ) ; while at higher redshifts , nearly every redshift is found through absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum ( see fig .  [ lisov1 ] and the _ swift _ archive ) .",
    "while this emission / absorption bias , @xmath68 , is not easy to quantify , it should not cause such an evolutionary effect , since most redshifts in our sample are found through absorption .",
    "the observability of an optical afterglow , @xmath69 , might be expected to be steeply falling with redshift ; however , for a spectrum @xmath70 @xcite , cosmological redshifting may allow the earliest ( brightest ) portion of the afterglow to be more visible @xcite .",
    "if the flatness of the obscuration - corrected sfh at moderate @xmath0 arose from a steeply increasing uncorrected rate and a deceasing dust correction , the detectable afterglow fraction might increase with redshift ; this does not appear to be the case @xcite .",
    "a paucity of ir detections of hosts of `` dark '' grbs also argues against a significant obscured fraction @xcite .",
    "the decision of which telescopes are made available to observe grbs , along with other such non - intrinsic properties , can be folded into @xmath71 .",
    "none of these terms appear to be able to increase overall observability with @xmath0 , disfavoring an origin of the trend in @xmath14 .",
    "we now investigate whether an evolving @xmath55 can explain the observed evolution . while it is now generally accepted that long grbs arise from massive stars , the special conditions that are required for such an event are still in question . in the collapsar model @xcite , the collapse of a rapidly - rotating , massive stellar core to a black hole powers a jet that is seen as a grb .",
    "since every observed supernova coincident with a grb has been of type  ic @xcite , the progenitor star should also have lost its outer envelope ( without losing precious angular momentum ) .",
    "rather strong observational evidence now indicates that grb host galaxies tend to be faint and metal - poor ( e.g. , @xcite ) , increasing interest in models that use single , low - metallicity stars as a pathway to a collapsar @xcite . decreasing cosmic metallicity may cause the grb / sn ratio to rise with @xmath0 ; e.g. , the prediction of @xcite can be estimated as @xmath72 @xcite . while a preference for low - metallicity environments may be the simplest explanation ,",
    "absorption line metallicity studies remain inconclusive @xcite",
    ". one may therefore wonder whether it is possible to concoct an evolutionary scenario without direct progenitor metallicity dependence .",
    "if grbs are instead produced in binary systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , some other mechanism might lead to the appearance of evolution .",
    "since most grbs appear to occur in star clusters @xcite , where the fraction of massive stars in binaries may be high @xcite , such channels could be important .",
    "for example , the merger of two @xmath73@xmath74 stars with @xmath75@xmath480.95 ( i.e. , `` twins '' , which may be common @xcite ) in close orbits ( @xmath76  few  au ) can lead to a more - massive , rapidly - rotating core lacking an envelope @xcite . in a dense cluster ,",
    "close binaries tend to end up closer due to gravitational scatterings with interloping stars ( heggie s law ; @xcite ) , with a scattering timescale of @xmath7710  myr for a stellar density of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "an increased rate of `` interloper - catalyzed '' binary mergers ( icbms ) could result from a larger fraction of star formation occurring in such environments at higher @xmath0 , and seen as an enhancement in the grb rate .",
    "such a speculative scenario presents a dynamical source of evolution ( instead of altering the microphysics ) and , as these rates are @xmath42@xmath79 , possibly allow for examination of the `` density contrast '' of star formation .",
    "it is interesting that grbs were discovered in searches for gamma rays from explosions related to icbms of a different sort @xcite .",
    "an evolving imf , becoming increasingly top - heavy at larger @xmath0 , would increase the relative number of massive stars produced .",
    "since star formation measurements are primarily based on radiation from such stars , this alone may not lead to apparent evolution , unless the very massive end ( @xmath80 ) changed significantly .",
    "any evidence of evolution in the imf ( e.g. , @xcite ) provides motivation for considering such a change .",
    "however , this need only occur in those galaxies that host gamma - ray bursts .",
    "a similar effect could result from a larger high-@xmath0 population of small galaxies resembling low-@xmath0 grb host galaxies , seen as evolution in the galaxy luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an additional possibility is that , if the massive stellar binary fraction decreases with declining metallicity , as might be evidenced in the lmc @xcite , the number of potential single - star progenitors may increase .    in conclusion ,",
    "the set of _ swift _ gamma - ray bursts now allows for model - independent tests of the connection between the grb and star formation rates .",
    "we present quantitative evidence that the grb rate does not simply track star formation over a broad range in redshift ; some mechanism , of a presently - unknown nature , is leading to an enhancement in the observed rate of high-@xmath0 gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the effects of stellar metallicity appear to be a compelling explanation , but can not be proven yet .",
    "additional observations will be the only way to discern the root cause of this effect , and allow for proper understanding of the underlying astrophysics .",
