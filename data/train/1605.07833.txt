    "blind source separation ( bss ) is a well - known and well - studied field in the adaptive signal processing and machine learning @xcite .",
    "the problem is to recover original and unknown sources from a set of mixtures recorded in an unknown environment .",
    "the term _ blind _ refers to the fact that both the sources and the mixing environment are unknown .",
    "several well - performing approaches exist when the mixing environment is instantaneous @xcite , while some problems still arise in convolutive environments @xcite .",
    "different approaches were proposed to solve bss in linear and instantaneous environment . some of these approaches perform separation by using high order statistics ( hos ) while others exploit information theoretic ( it ) measures @xcite .",
    "one of the well - know algorithms in this latter class is the infomax one proposed by bell and sejnowski in @xcite .",
    "the infomax algorithm is based on the maximization of the joint entropy of the output of a single layer neural network and it is very efficient and easy to implement since the gradient of the joint entropy can be evaluated simply in a closed form .",
    "moreover , in order to avoid numerical instability , a natural gradient modification to infomax algorithm has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all these solutions perform slowly when the number of the original sources to be separated is high and/or bad scaled .",
    "the separation becomes impossible if the number of sources is equal or greater than ten .",
    "in addition , the convergence speed problem worsen in the case of additive sensor noise to mixtures or when the mixing matrix is close to be ill - conditioned",
    ". however , specially when working with speech and audio signals , fast convergence speed is an important task to be performed .",
    "many authors have tried to overcome this problem : some solutions consist in incorporating a momentum term in the learning rule @xcite , in a self - adjusting variable step - size @xcite or in a scaled natural gradient algorithm @xcite .    recently , a novel algorithm for gradient based optimization of stochastic cost functions has been proposed by kingma and ba in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is based on the adaptive estimates of the first and second order moments of the gradient , and for this reason has been called the adaptive moment estimation ( adam ) algorithm .",
    "the authors have demonstrated in @xcite that adam is easy to implement , computationally efficient , invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients and well suited for problems with large data and parameters .",
    "the adam algorithm combines the advantages of other state - of - the - art optimization algorithms , like adagrad @xcite and rmsprop @xcite , outperforming the limitations of these algorithms .",
    "in addition , adam can be related to the natural gradient ( ng ) adaptation @xcite , employing a preconditioning that adapts to the geometry of data .    in this paper",
    "we propose a modified infomax algorithm based on the adam algorithm @xcite for the solution of bss problems .",
    "we derive the proposed modified algorithm by using the adam algorithm instead of the standard stochastic gradient ascent rule .",
    "it is shown that the novel algorithm has a faster convergence speed with respect to the standard infomax algorithm and usually also reaches a better separation .",
    "some experimental results , evaluated in terms of the amari performance index ( pi ) @xcite , show the effectiveness of the proposed idea .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : bss ] we briefly introduce the problem of bss . then",
    ", we give some details on the adam algorithm in section [ sec : adam ] . the main novelty of this paper , the extension of infomax algorithm with adam",
    "is provided in section [ sec : adam_infomax ] .",
    "finally , we validate our approach in section [ sec : results ] .",

    "signals received by an array of @xmath3 sensors are denoted by @xmath4 = \\left [ x_1[n ] , \\ldots , x_m[n ] \\right]^t$ ] and are called mixtures . for simplicity , here we consider the case of @xmath5 .    in the case of a linear and instantaneous mixing environment , the mixture can be described in a matrix form as @xmath6 = { \\bf{a } } { \\bf{s}}[n ] + { \\bf{v}}[n ] , \\label{eq : mixtures}\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath7 collects the mixing coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 = \\left [ v_1[n ] , \\ldots , v_n[n ] \\right]^t$ ] is a noise vector , with correlation matrix @xmath11 and noise variance @xmath12 .",
    "the separated signals @xmath13 $ ] are obtained by a separating matrix @xmath14 as described by the following equation @xmath15 = { \\bf{w } } { \\bf{x}}[n ] .",

    "scaling ambiguity of the bss problem , the output signals @xmath13 $ ] can be expressed as @xmath15 = { \\bf{pd } } { \\bf{s}}[n ] , \\label{eq : permutation}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is an @xmath19 permutation matrix and @xmath20 is an @xmath19 diagonal scaling matrix .",
    "the weights @xmath21 can be adapted by maximizing or minimizing some suitable cost function @xcite .",
    "a particularly good approach is to maximize the joint entropy of a single layer neural network @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig : infomax ] , leading to the bell and sejnowski infomax algorithm . in this network",

    "le us denote with @xmath45 a noisy cost function to be minimized ( or maximized ) with respect to the parameters @xmath46 . the problem is considered stochastic for the random nature of data samples or for inherent function noise . in the following",
    ", the noisy gradient vector at time @xmath47 of the cost function @xmath45 with respect to the parameters @xmath46 , will be denoted with @xmath48 .",
    "the adam algorithm performs the gradient descent ( or ascent ) optimization by evaluating the moving averages of the noisy gradient @xmath49 and the square gradient @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "these moment vectors are updated by using two scalar coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 that control the exponential decay rates : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denotes the element - wise multiplication , while @xmath56 and @xmath57 are initialized as zero vectors . these vectors represent the mean and the uncentered variance of the gradient vector @xmath58 . since the estimates of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are biased towards zero , due to their initialization , a bias correction is computed on these moments @xmath59 the vector @xmath60 represents an approximation of the diagonal of the fisher information matrix @xcite .",

    "since we used real data and the mixing matrix @xmath108 is not available , the pi can not be evaluated .",
    "hence , we decided to evaluate the performance by the norm of the gradient of the cost function .",
