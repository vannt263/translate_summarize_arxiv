    "polymer chains grafted to a surface or an interface have been the focus of extensive study during the past 15 years because of their practical importance . in particular",
    ", polymers grafted at the interface of two polymeric networks or solids , often diffuse into the bulk which will then increase the bonding of the two solids .",
    "this may be due to some type of chemical bonding between the grafted chains and the bulk polymers but can also be due to entanglements between them",
    ". grafted polymers with such functions have been termed _",
    "connectors _ for this reason@xcite .",
    "since the junction is weaker than the bulk , the interface region usually fractures when an excessive stress is applied@xcite . as the crack tip propagates along the interface , the chains either break or are pulled out , and this process is believed to contribute to the toughness of the interface@xcite .",
    "although there have been numerous studies of the molecular mechanism of fracture for these systems , relatively little is known about the dynamics of the interface s formation .",
    "understanding the dynamical aspects of this problem is important . as will be discussed below , the approach to equilibrium of these systems",
    "are often so slow that equilibrium conformations can never be achieved in the time scale of the experiments .",
    "therefore the dynamics of these systems must be considered .",
    "different models of chain pull - out , which make predictions about the toughness of an interface , make different assumptions about the dynamics . since there are some discrepancies between different models@xcite it is important to have a better theoretical understanding of the dynamics , as well as performing further experiments .",
    "another important application of the interface dynamics is in understanding the case of interface `` healing '' . in the case where the toughness arises solely from entanglement effects ,",
    "an interface can be healed even after a complete physical failure . to understand the recovery of the toughness upon re - contact requires a detailed knowledge of the system s dynamics .",
    "recently oconnor and mcleish@xcite , motivated by the experiment of reichert and brown@xcite , investigated the relaxation of connector chains in an elastomer network attached to a glassy polymer .",
    "they considered the case where the chains are compatible with the elastomer but not with the surface of the interface .",
    "they found that there exist three stages in healing upon contact with the interface .",
    "first , the chain relaxes inside the interface .",
    "after this , the chain penetrates into the network .",
    "this is achieved in the rouse time and most of the toughness is recovered at this stage . on a much longer time scale ,",
    "the penetration point moves logarithmically toward the point where the chain is anchored .",
    "the typical value of the total toughness gain by this _ penetration - point - hopping _ process was estimated to be about 2 .",
    "soon after the theoretical work of oconnor and mcleish , creton et  al.@xcite conducted a more detailed experiment with some of the results apparently inconsistent with the current theories ( see also brown@xcite ) .",
    "they carried out an experiment , which was originally devised by johnson , kendall and roberts@xcite , on the interface between a cross - linked polyisoprene  ( pi ) matrix and a polystyrene  ( ps ) substrate grafted with pi chains .",
    "one interesting result of their work is that the dependence of toughness on molecular weight of tethered chains is not as strong as theories predict .",
    "it is hoped that a more complete understanding of the dynamics of the grafted chains will reconcile some of these inconsistencies .      in this paper",
    "we consider the interface formed between a cross - linked polymer matrix and a rigid , non - reactive surface when connector chains , with polymerization index  @xmath2 , are end - tethered to the surface .",
    "the chains are assumed to be chemically compatible with the matrix unless specified otherwise and have a monomer size or _ kuhn length _ of  @xmath3 .",
    "the degree of the coverage is usually classified , according to the surface density , @xmath4 , of the grafted chains . at low densities , @xmath5 ,",
    "one has what is termed a  mushroom regime \" since single chains that are repelled by a surface form a mushroom - like or plume - like shape in equilibrium . in this paper",
    "we study this low density regime where the interaction between different connector chains can be ignored , in which case we only need to consider the behavior of a single connector chain .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the relaxation of a connector chain from a conformation lying on the surface to the equilibrium plume - like configuration .",
    "experimentally relevant quantities are obtained by averaging over the ensemble of these ( non - interacting ) chains .",
    "what is the most relevant quantity one needs to measure in order to describe the toughness enhancement of the interface arising from the pull - out of a single connector chain ?",
    "first we note that the chain pull - out process is viscous .",
    "hence toughness enhancement due to the connectors should be a monotonically increasing function of the chain length inside the rubber .",
    "when the crack propagation speed is larger than a certain critical value , a simple theory@xcite predicts that the toughness due to this energy loss when connector chain is pulled out , is proportional to the square of the chain length inside the rubber . when this speed is small raphal and de  gennes@xcite formulated a theory which predicts that the toughness is linearly proportional to the chain length inside the rubber . as such , the chain length inside the rubber is expected to play an important role in describing the toughness recovery process , and is therefore measured as a function of time in our simulation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will give the precise definition of the problem under investigation and some important concepts will be introduced .",
    "after this the numerical model and the simulation algorithm will be given in detail .",
    "our simulation results will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the initial expansion process after the contact of the two materials , is studied in  sec .",
    "[ chains_tethered_at_both_ends ] .",
    "we study the dynamics of the chain with both ends tethered as well as that of the chain with only one end fixed .",
    "the double grafting is interesting not only because of its relevance to the initial relaxation of the singly grafted chain , but also because this might have some interesting experimental applications .",

    "first , the theoretical model of oconnor and mcleish will be discussed in  sec .",

    "[ interfacial entanglement_effects ] studies a situation different from the ones above in that the dynamics of the grafted chain are constrained by entanglements even in the interface region .",
    "rather different results are obtained due to this entanglement effect .",
    "finally we summarize our results and present some directions for further investigation in the last section .",
    "now we describe the overall picture of the chain penetration process .",
    "initially the chain is assumed to be exposed to the air and hence to be spread out on the substrate with a thickness of order @xmath3 , the monomer size .",
    "this is a result of the high surface tension in this situation .",
    "therefore the initial conformation on the interface is assumed to be a 2  dimensional random walk . throughout this work we will ignore the interactions of the connector chain with itself .    in most of this work",
    ", the connector chain is assumed to be chemically compatible with the constituent polymers of the elastomer .",
    "we can quantify this by defining an affinity parameter between the chain and the wall , @xmath6 , which is the interaction energy per monomer between the chain and the wall relative to that between the chain and the gel , in units of  @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath6 is assumed to be close to zero . in this case , the equilibrium conformation is plume - like , having dimensions of order that of a free phantom chain .",
    "if there were no entanglements it should reach an equilibrium conformation in a rouse time scale .",
    "however the topological constraints imposed by the network prevent the chain from moving freely into the gel .",
    "initially the chain is repelled from the surface and makes `` hernias '' or kink - like configurations that penetrate into the network . for the case of a chain with both ends tethered ,",
    "this penetration by making hernias is the only mode of motion . depending on the thickness of the slab and the chemical properties of the interface",
    ", the chain may penetrate into the network deep enough to contribute to the adhesion of the two materials .",
    "but for the singly tethered chain , the free end moves into the gel , at a point of order @xmath8 from the tethered end , forming a plume .",
    "we will see that the plume pulls out much of the slack from the rest of the chain because this is entropically favored .",
    "the plume size that initially forms depends strongly on the degree of entanglements in the interface .",
    "even though we concern ourselves mostly with the low coverage regime in which case the chains should move freely inside the interface , we discuss in  sec .",
    "[ interfacial entanglement_effects ] the effects of entanglements in the interface",
    ". these should be present at higher densities and can be caused by interactions between grafted chains    let us suppose that a chain initially penetrates into the network at a distance   from the anchor site .",
    "then we will see shortly that this conformation is in a metastable state with a very large relaxation time@xcite .",
    "after the time scale associated with reaching this metastable plume state , the relaxation time depends exponentially on the penetrated length of the tethered chain . at times greater than this the chain relaxes by slowly shifting its entry point into the gel and",
    "eventually the total toughness is recovered .",
    "the cross - linked network is modeled in this work by the so called _ cage model_. the cage model was first introduced by doi@xcite and evans and edwards@xcite to investigate numerically the properties of the reptating polymers predicted by de  gennes@xcite .",
    "the chain sits on a lattice with lattice constant @xmath3 . in between lattice points",
    "is a cage . the cage which resembles a cubical `` jungle - gym '' imposes topological constraints on the motion of polymers .",
    "the distance between adjacent parallel bars is chosen to be the entanglement length  @xmath9 , which is usually assumed to be an integral multiple of the lattice constant  @xmath3 .    in this simulation",
    ", we only consider the case where the kuhn length is the same as the entanglement length of the network , that is ,  @xmath10 . in this case , if we consider both the cross - link points of the cage and the lattice sites the monomers can occupy , we obtain a lattice that is body centered cubic ( bcc ) , which is bipartite . the cross - link points occupy one sublattice and the polymer moving around it occupies the other .",
    "the cage is restricted to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the thickness of the interface region . due to the discreteness of the lattice , @xmath12 is somewhat ambiguous and we use half - integer values for @xmath12 because the cage lies half way between lattice points . in most experiments in the low coverage regime ,",
    "the network is frequently in contact with the surface and thus @xmath13 should correspond well to this situation .",
    "( recall @xmath14 ) .",
    "the case with general half - integer @xmath12 s will be discussed briefly in the next section .",
    "we tether one end of the @xmath2-mer chain at the origin and place the rest randomly on the surface , which is chosen to be the @xmath15-plane with @xmath16 .",
    "( the other end is also tethered in sec .",
    "[ chains_tethered_at_both_ends ] . ) after this it moves into the gel network by dynamics that are described below .",
    "the chain is not allowed to penetrate into the wall  @xmath17 .",
    "we choose an arbitrary bead other than the grafted end(s ) , and attempt to move it according to the following rules .",
    "move i : :    if it is the free end , it is moved to one of the six nearest neighbor    points ( on the same sublattice ) .",
    "excluded volume effects are    completely ignored in this work except for the presence of the hard    wall .",
    "move ii : :    if its two nearest neighbor beads along the backbone are on the same    lattice point , then we move this middle point randomly to one of the    six nearest neighbor points .",
    "move iii : :    in most of the cases we study there are no entanglements on the    surface and so we must add one more move set . if the chosen point and    its two nearest neighbor beads lie in the region  @xmath18    and they form a right angle , we flip the middle bead through the    diagonal made by the other two .",
    "if the newly selected point ( after the temporary move ) does not violate the constraints imposed by the wall we accept the move and update the conformation of the polymer . in the course of a simulation this procedure",
    "is repeated many times with beads that are chosen randomly .    in systems where there is an interaction between the chain and the wall , the case of non - vanishing  @xmath6 ,",
    "the acceptance probability is @xmath19 following the usual metropolis algorithm . here",
    "@xmath20 is the energy change after the attempted move , which is @xmath21 times @xmath22 if the number of beads which are in contact with the wall changes by one .",
    "we define a monte carlo step ( mcs ) as @xmath23 such attempts for the singly grafted chain and as @xmath24 for the doubly grafted one .",
    "one mcs corresponds to the monomeric relaxation time  @xmath25 .    as mentioned in the previous section , the time dependence of the number of monomers in the penetrated part of the chain plays an important role in the toughness recovery process .",
    "so does the distance to the penetration point , @xmath26 , in discussing the long time behavior .",
    "we measure these as well as other quantities such as the average height @xmath27 and the radius of gyration in the vertical direction @xmath28 .",
    "these are defined by the following equations .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath31-coordinate of the @xmath32-th monomer .    in the following sections",
    ", we will analyze the dynamics of this system when @xmath6 is zero , negative ( @xmath33 ) and positive ( @xmath34 ) . in order to find out how far away these systems are from equilibrium ,",
    "it is useful to have equilibrium statistics .",
    "these are easily obtained by using faster dynamics that do not have the topological constraints imposed by the network . to obtain these faster dynamics ,",
    "we include the right angle flip ( move iii ) everywhere along the chain .",
    "these moves can pass cage bars but give precisely the same equilibrium statistics .",
    "these dynamics have the relaxation time of the rouse time ( @xmath35 ) and therefore give accurate results for equilibrium quantities .",
    "the equilibrium values of several quantities are tabulated for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and these will be used in the following sections .",
    "see tables  [ zero_chi ] , [ attractive_0.7 ] and  [ repulsive_2.3 ] .",
    ".equilibrium values of various quantities when there is no interaction between the chain and the wall , i.e. , @xmath40 . these were obtained using faster dynamics as explained in the text .",
    "note that @xmath3 is set to 1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     among those tabulated quantities the _ the primitive length _ deserves some discussion .",
    "first , it is straightforward to see that the length of chain that has penetrated the network is an ill defined quantity .",
    "it has an ambiguity for phantom chains when kinks are present at the penetration point .",
    "so , instead , we use the primitive path@xcite , which is defined as the path of minimum length between the two end points that can be obtained by pulling all the slack from a chain without violating any topological constraints imposed by entanglements .",
    "the _ primitive path length _ , or _ primitive length _ , has been used in studying viscoelastic properties of polymers in a melt or a gel and is proportional to the total chain length in equilibrium .",
    "this yields an unambiguous definition of penetration length in our case : after finding the primitive path , we divide it into two parts at the penetration point .",
    "the number of beads in its penetrated part will be denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "it will be extensively used in analyzing our simulations .",
    "we first study the case of a chain tethered at both ends .",
    "we create a chain as a 2-d random walk on the surface and fix both ends at these initial positions .",
    "even though there is no excluded volume interaction between the chain and the gel network , the topological constraint imposed by permanently attaching both ends of the chain to the substrate effectively generates a repulsive interaction between them . when the interface thickness @xmath12 is bigger than a certain critical value , the penetration of the chain into the gel will be highly suppressed .",
    "this phenomenon is an example of _ ground state dominance_@xcite , and in this case is due to a purely topological reason@xcite . in other words , when the chain enters the network its entropy is reduced due to the topology of the doubly grafted chain which restrict allowed conformations to only double back on themselves .",
    "if the interface is sufficiently thick , it maximizes its entropy by staying in the interface .",
    "however if the interface slab is thin enough , it loses more entropy staying in the interface then venturing into the network , and so it will be more favorable for the chain to penetrate into the network by making hernias .",
    "in such a case the height of the chain can grow beyond  @xmath12 depending on the amount of slack in the chain , which is the total chain length subtracted from the distance between the tethered ends .",
    "in fact , cross - over behavior from an extended state to the collapsed one is expected when the thickness of the interface @xmath12 is increased .      upon attaching the rubber to the substrate , the thickness of the disc - like conformation of the connector increases to of order  @xmath12 , in a time scale of  @xmath42@xcite .",
    "that is , the height @xmath43 averaged over the ensemble grows as  @xmath44 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ averageheight ] for  @xmath45 .",
    "even though this was obtained for a system in which both ends of the chain were fixed on the @xmath15-plane , this initial penetration behavior is expected to be the same for the singly tethered case , because the free end becomes important on a time scale of  @xmath46 , as we will see in the next section .",
    "but in order to minimize boundary effects , the data shown here was collected only from the middle  @xmath47 monomers .",
    "this initial rapid growth stops when the average height reaches of order  @xmath12 . after this time",
    "scale the growth slows down .",
    "[ kinkpenetration ] shows the slow penetration of hernias into the gel as a function of  @xmath12 .",
    "as stated earlier , penetration is achieved only for the case of sufficiently small  @xmath12 .",
    "as the figure suggests , when @xmath12 is larger than  @xmath48 the saturation values of the _ penetrated _ height appear to be close to zero .",
    "[ growthhernias ] shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "this picture was obtained from 2-d system for the sake of clarity .",
    "there is a substantial penetration for the case @xmath49 , whereas for the case @xmath50 there is very little penetration .",
    "one interesting result is that the average radius of gyration in the @xmath31-direction , @xmath51 , has much weaker growth than the average height @xmath43 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ averageheight ] the slope is @xmath52 rather than  @xmath53 .",
    "this shows that the chain as a whole translates away from the wall , and penetrates the network at a much slower rate .",
    "the @xmath54 increase in @xmath51 can be understood by noting that the loops in the network are lattice animals@xcite .",
    "lattice animals have a fractal dimension of 4 so that a loop in the network of @xmath55 monomers has @xmath56 .",
    "the length of the loops increases by a diffusive process and therefore @xmath57 .",
    "these two equations lead to the exponent of @xmath58 found above .",
    "in the previous section , it was shown that topological interactions limit the penetration of the doubly tethered chain .",
    "topological constraints do not limit conformations accessible to the singly tethered case . in this case the network , in our numerical model , has no effect on equilibrium properties .",
    "in addition , when there is no attraction between the chain and the surface , we expect the chain will eventually reach the equilibrium plume - like shape mentioned earlier . as we now describe , the network affects the dynamics of this system in a drastic manner .",
    "the effects described below were recently worked out by oconnor and mcleish@xcite .    once the chain end enters the gel , that portion of the chain in the gel is confined to a tube of diameter  @xmath59 .",
    "the rest of the chain is constrained to the slab of thickness  @xmath60 .",
    "therefore we have two different relaxation modes , the snake - like motion of segments in the network and the 2  dimensional rouse motion for the rest .",
    "the segment of length @xmath61 will assume a plume - like conformation of size  @xmath62 , as it enters the gel . while this plume by definition starts at the surface , the center of the plume diffuses away from the wall because its size grows as more monomers enter the gel .",
    "eventually the tension on the chain segment in the slab becomes big enough to counteract the pulling force of the free end , at which point the chain conformation will be `` runner - like '' , in that it consists of a plume and a trailing part which connects the plume to the graft site .",
    "this is a metastable state as claimed earlier .",
    "now we examine this process more quantitatively giving a slightly simpler version of the argument of oconnor and mcleish@xcite .",
    "let us suppose the free end penetrates into the gel at a distance @xmath26 from the origin .",
    "we will consider the statistical mechanics of this situation when the penetration point is held fixed .",
    "then the free energy for the conformations , with @xmath63 monomers in the slab , can be written as follows , @xmath64 the first term is the elastic energy of the portion of the chain along the surface and the second term represents the penalty due to its topological confinement in the slab@xcite .",
    "the free energy is defined relative to that of a plume in true equilibrium , that is @xmath65 .",
    "the numerical coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants of order 1 , and will be retained because their values can have important effects on the behavior of the system .",
    "these constants depend only on the geometrical properties of the system . for the case with non - zero @xmath6",
    ", we have to add to eq .",
    "( [ free_energy ] ) one more term which is proportional to  @xmath63 .",
    "this is neglected for the moment .    by minimizing this expression with respect to @xmath63",
    "we get @xmath68 since there is no metastable state in the latter case , the upper bound for @xmath26 is @xmath69 .",
    "when the chain does penetrate , the segment in the slab is highly stretched in this local minimum because @xmath63 is linearly proportional to  @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that most of the slack in the initial 2-d configuration of the chain must flow out of the slab and end up in the penetrated portion of the chain .",
    "this is a consequence of the unfavorable entropic conditions at the surface .",
    "this entropic driving force will then lead to a rapid penetration of the chain by the diffusion of kinks , or defects , along the backbone of the chain .",
    "if we extend the concept of primitive path to include the slab in addition to the tube , one can see that the primitive length is expected to increase in time .",
    "this is because the initial primitive length , @xmath70 , is shorter than the value after long times when the chain is in its equilibrium state , in which case the primitive length , which is the sum of two parts one in the slab and one in the gel , is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "hence the primitive length increases by diffusion of kinks .",
    "the growth of the primitive length is then proportional to  @xmath71 .",
    "this process continues until the spring force of the segment in the slab of length @xmath72 becomes comparable to the force due to confinement .",
    "the typical value of @xmath63 at which the growth of @xmath73 slows down , is around @xmath74 , i.e. ,  @xmath75 , as will be shown shortly .",
    "hence @xmath71 growth persists until the time scale of  @xmath46 .",
    "we now would like to compute the free energy barrier @xmath76 that these runner - like conformations must overcome in order to shift the penetration point closer to the point of tether .",
    "for these runner - like conformations , the free energy , as a function of the entrance point  @xmath26 , can be expressed as @xmath77    the free energy barriers for these metastable states are the free energy differences between the runner states and the conformations when the whole chain is completely pulled out from the gel , that is , when  @xmath78 .",
    "therefore @xmath79    the relaxation time of this metastable state is given by kramer s formula @xmath80 compare this expression with the tube renewal time for a segment of length @xmath81 of the arm of a star polymer in a cross - linked network@xcite , which is given by @xmath82 where the constant @xmath83 comes from the confinement of the chain in a tube of diameter @xmath9 and will presumably be larger than  @xmath67@xcite .",
    "therefore we see that the plume formed at @xmath26 can tunnel into nearby local minima , in a time scale of  @xmath84 , thereby reducing the free energy given by eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) .",
    "this penetration process is finally completed when @xmath26 reaches of order  @xmath12 .      in the previous section",
    "it was assumed that the connector chain was chemically identical to the constituent polymers of the elastomer .",
    "now we discuss the more general situation of non - zero  @xmath6 .",
    "first , we study the attractive case , @xmath85 .",
    "attractive molecular forces , such as van der waals forces , between the grafted chains and the substrate will give rise to a negative @xmath6 , as will the chemical incompatibility between the chains and the network .",
    "the fact that the tethered chains have to swell the cross - linked network is another reason for @xmath6 to become negative . because the surface represents an infinite potential barrier , small negative @xmath6 is not enough to localize the chain to the surface .",
    "there is a critical value of attraction @xmath86 giving two distinct types of equilibrium behavior .",
    "for @xmath87 the chain behaves much the same way as described in the previous section when @xmath88 . for @xmath89 the chain will spread out on the surface in a pancake - like conformation , giving rise to a finite chain thickness @xmath27 independent of chain length .",
    "this is another situation characterized by ground state dominance .",
    "table  [ attractive_0.7 ] is obtained for  @xmath90 .",
    "the average height of the chain is about a quarter of  @xmath91 regardless of the size of the chain ,  @xmath2 , indicating this @xmath92 is much bigger than @xmath93 .",
    "but even for such a strongly adsorbed case , the penetration is appreciable as shown in table  [ attractive_0.7 ] , and we expect strongly adsorbed grafted chains to make a significant contribution to the toughness of the interface .",
    "finally we mention the case with positive  @xmath6 . the case with @xmath94",
    "is already a strongly repulsive situation , since grafted chains are excluded from the wall because of the excluded volume constraint .",
    "in fact the limit @xmath95 is equivalent to taking @xmath96 and making the wall thicker .",
    "therefore no qualitatively different results are expected in the case of positive  @xmath6 .",
    "however the simulation results deviate from this expectation due to a problem with monte - carlo dynamics .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "first we note that for the bcc lattice cage model with @xmath10 , analytic solutions can be obtained exactly for many equilibrium properties@xcite@xcite . among others the average primitive length in equilibrium , @xmath97 ,",
    "can be easily calculated using the fact that the primitive path is a non - reversible random walk .",
    "@xmath97 is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the coordination number of the sublattice where the polymers reside which is @xmath100 in our case , and so @xmath101 simulation results given in table  [ zero_chi ] are remarkably close to the above formula .",
    "now we discuss the penetration of the chain into the gel . as was mentioned earlier",
    ", this process can be understood as the diffusion of kinks out of the surface region and into the plume region , and is driven by the entropy loss in the vicinity of the surface .",
    "the regime of rapid penetration of the chain is shown in fig .",
    "[ evolutiontethered ] for  @xmath102 .",
    "almost all the segments are inside the gel by the time @xmath103 .       fig .",
    "[ scalingpenetration ] demonstrates scaling behavior for chains of different lengths , in this case @xmath36 , 50 , 100 , and  200 .",
    "the vertical axis is scaled by the number of monomers , @xmath2 , and the time axis by  @xmath104 , that is @xmath105 therefore the relaxation time is @xmath106 as with rouse relaxation .",
    "the log - log plot for @xmath107 is shown in the inset and fits well to a straight line with slope  @xmath48 .",
    "this data was obtained , as stated earlier , with random walk initial conformations , which probably differ somewhat from experimental conditions .",
    "however we have found that the result of @xmath71 growth is not very sensitive to the initial conditions , because all but the typical value of @xmath108 are suppressed in the initial penetration step .",
    "if the chain is initially stretched , it contracts first to a gaussian shape to reduce the tension before the chain enters the network . as an extreme example demonstrating this point , we prepared `` samples '' in which the grafted chains were initially stretched completely , say along the @xmath109-axis .",
    "the behavior for @xmath73 , was very similar to the case with random walk initial conditions .",
    "but , as we can see in fig",
    ".  [ effectinitial ] , the initial penetration was clearly suppressed compared to the previous case .",
    "the inset compares the approaches of the penetration points to the origin .",
    "in contrast , the samples with the chain initially bunched up near the origin have a slight advantage .",
    "this head start is reflected in fig .",
    "[ effectinitial ] as a small left shift of the curve .       in a much longer time scale after the chain reaches the first metastable state , the relaxation is similar to that of a star polymer in a network . in our case ,",
    "the penetration point relaxes slowly towards the origin by retracting the arm into the slab .",
    "since the initial value of @xmath26 is typically @xmath110 , the increase of @xmath41 at this last stage is of order  @xmath111 , which is negligible unless  @xmath112 .",
    "the system gains almost all its toughness in a time  @xmath113 .",
    "note also that the increase of toughness after this time scale proceeds very slowly because in situations with even moderate chain length , the characteristic time , @xmath114 is very large compared to  @xmath46 .",
    "[ chaingrowth ] shows that @xmath73 increases until it reaches a saturation value  @xmath115 .",
    "the inset is for  @xmath102 and shows the penetration point approaching the origin in an exponential time scale .",
    "systems with @xmath2 larger than 50 did not get to the last stage in a reasonable simulation time .",
    "first we examine the attractive case numerically .",
    "[ penetrationchain ] shows the case @xmath90 for different chain lengths .",
    "they scale as @xmath116 for short times , @xmath117 , indicating the growth is initially @xmath118 .",
    "the log - log plot in the inset shows that the exponent is indeed close to 0.4 .",
    "the reason why the exponent for the attractive case is 0.4 is unknown .",
    "it is also apparent that the toughness increases rather quickly with time again indicating that this situation should lead to an enhancement of toughness in an experimentally accessible time scale .",
    "this penetration process for the attractive case is shown in fig .",
    "[ attractivecase ] for the 2  dimensional case .          when the substrate is another rubber - like material instead of an impenetrable surface , one has a similar situation .",
    "since the wall acts as a repulsive potential , its removal decreases the effective value of  @xmath6 , making the interaction attractive when the substrate is not too chemically incompatible with connectors . in this case , one has a large toughness because the grafted chain prefers to stay near the interface region while making `` many stitches '' , of order  @xmath74 , between the two rubbers .",
    "this situation was recently analyzed by ji and de  gennes@xcite .",
    "now we discuss the opposite extreme . when the gel swelling is not very significant and the connector chain is compatible with the network , @xmath6 is often positive .",
    "in addition to the chemical disparity between the chain and the substrate , contamination of the interface can be another reason for the chain to disfavor the surface .",
    "in this case , the chain tends to be expelled from the surface more strongly compared to the case  @xmath40 .",
    "paradoxically , our simulation results suggest that this expulsion slows down the dynamics of chain penetration , although we believe this is an artifact of using monte carlo dynamics , as explained below .",
    "this is similar to the problem of monte carlo dynamics for dna gel electrophoresis in a strong field , which has been investigated in recent years@xcite .",
    "extruded defects driven by the strong surface repulsion grow until the tension becomes large enough to counteract the repulsive force from the wall .",
    "the chain at the wall , being under high tension , should be quite taut .",
    "the lack of kinks at the wall means that the dynamics become slow in this region .",
    "this is unphysical because in reality even a completely taut chain can diffuse , whereas the dynamics used here do not have collective motions allowing a defect free segment to move .",
    "another way of seeing the difficulty is that a kink traveling onto the surface must surmount an energy barrier of @xmath6 which slows down the dynamics considerably when @xmath6 is large .",
    "this is an artifact of monte carlo simulations with local dynamics@xcite .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by either using a monte carlo model with long range moves@xcite or using dynamics that are continuous in time@xcite .",
    "the situation here is not as serious as with electrophoresis where potential energy scales linearly with chain length .",
    "the slowing down here is a result of an activation free energy barrier @xmath119 , with no dependence on the size of the defect .",
    "therefore on a sufficiently long time scale the power law behavior should be the same as when @xmath96 and a @xmath71 growth is observed .",
    "this interesting but spurious behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ whenwall ] for @xmath120 , 50 and 100 with  @xmath121 .",
    "now we study the effects of putting entanglements in the interface region itself .",
    "there are some situations where interfacial entanglements might become important .",
    "suppose for example that the substrate of the tethered chain embedded in a thin layer containing a slightly incompatible polymer network .",
    "before adhesion to the compatible network , the tethered chain is allowed to relax in the embedded layer .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of negative @xmath6 discussed in  [ analytical , non - zero chi ] . after some time the chain will become intertwined with this layer of material . upon attachment of the compatible network it will move into it , but",
    "now its motion is more highly constrained due to the presence of entanglements in the thin layer .",
    "we will now see that these surface entanglements have a dramatic effect on the dynamics of the grafted chains .",
    "the model studied in sec .",
    "[ chains_tethered_at_one_end ] must be modified to take into account this entanglement effect in the interface region . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the entanglement length in this region is the same as in the network .",
    "also in the simulations , we are assuming as before , that the lattice size of the cage equals the distance between monomers .",
    "the tethered chain now moves along a small tube not only in the 3-d network but also in the 2-d interface region .",
    "before we consider the relaxation of this entangled chain , it should be noted that the primitive length of the initial conformation is close to its equilibrium value , since it is already constrained to a tube .",
    "as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : exactl ] ) , the 3-d value of the equilibrium primitive length is @xmath122 , whereas the 2-d value is @xmath123 .",
    "this should be compared with the previous situation where the initial primitive length was just the end to end distance of a gaussian chain in a slab which is of order @xmath74 .",
    "because here the initial value of the primitive length is 25 percent less than in equilibrium , the chain slightly expands its primitive path while penetrating into the gel .",
    "kinks on the surface feel a repulsive entropic force which causes them to escape by climbing up the free end to avoid the surface .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ initialgrowth ] shows the initial growth of the plume .",
    "as the figure shows the exponent of @xmath41 as a function of time is @xmath124 , because this is a diffusive process .",
    "this regime lasts until @xmath113 . by the end of this time the primitive length of the chain",
    "has increased by of order @xmath2 monomers .",
    "viewed at this time scale , the end of the chain has formed a small plume and the rest of the chain is in a tube embedded in the interface . at longer time scales , the dynamics become very slow and similar to the case of no interfacial entanglements . in order for the tube to escape into the gel , the chain has to overcome a free energy barrier as in the previous section . from a relaxation time formula similar to eq .",

    "this should be contrasted with the case of no interfacial entanglements . there",
    "almost all the toughness is recovered in the time scale @xmath46 .",
    "the entire relaxation behavior is shown in fig .  [ initialgrowth ] for  @xmath36 .",

    "the general features have been found to be in good agreement with the predictions of oconnor and mcleish@xcite .",
    "as soon as the contact is made , the grafted chain starts to penetrate into the rubber network at a distance of order @xmath128 from the anchor point . if there is no interaction between the grafted chain and the surface , the primitive length in the penetrated part increases as  @xmath71 .",
    "this process persists up to a time scale  @xmath46 . in the case of no interfacial entanglements , almost all the chain segments",
    "penetrate into the network in this time scale .",

    "can easily exceed days or weeks in quite reasonable experimental situations , using moderate size polymers .",
