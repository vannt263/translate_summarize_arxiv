    "as far as we are aware it is unknown if the tidal forces in a binary inspiral can create shock waves before the binary objects touch , begin mass transfer or plunge . in order to investigate this ,",
    "we have developed a quantitative criterion for the critical amplitude at which stellar perturbations form shocks that may be interesting in its own right , or in other applications .",
    "this work was originally motivated by the observation of unsmooth fluid behaviour in the numerical simulation of an irrotational , equal mass neutron star ( ns ) binary merger ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations show surface waves breaking when the initial data are evolved with the cold equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 , and a strong wind when they are evolved with the equivalent hot eos @xmath1 ( with initially constant entropy ) .",
    "as both simulations should be identical until genuine shocks form , it seems likely that both the wind and the surface waves are artefacts of the interaction with the artificial atmosphere . on the other hand",
    ", these artefacts may also hide genuine shocks .",
    "mass shedding in small amplitude nonlinear perturbations has been demonstrated numerically for neutron stars rotating near the mass - shedding angular velocity ( @xcite ) , but the minimum perturbation amplitude for this to occur has not been quantified .",
    "we have therefore tried to obtain a quantitative criterion for shock formation using a combination of stellar perturbation theory and nonlinear planar fluid dynamics .",
    "we consider a shock formation scenario where essentially radial sound waves steepen as they approach the surface because the density and sound speed approach zero at the surface .",
    "( note that while the shape of the tidal bulges rotates around the star , individual fluid elements mainly move up and down . )",
    "if such waves are generated by tidal forces from the companion , their amplitude and shape is determined in the bulk of the star , where almost all the mass is . in this regime",
    ", linear perturbation theory can be used to obtain the response of the star to the tidal force , treating its proper oscillation modes as forced harmonic oscillators . for simplicity , we assume that the background star is irrotational and spherical .    on the other hand , near the surface the fluid geometry can be approximated as plane - parallel , and entropy or composition gradients become irrelevant compared to the density gradient . in this regime",
    "we use a hodograph transform to cast the nonlinear dynamics into a single _ linear _ second - order pde . a shock forms if and",
    "only if the hodograph transform becomes singular : a criterion for this can be examined within the model itself ( @xcite ) .",
    "this criterion was tested in the numerical evolution of nonlinear spherical perturbations of an @xmath2 polytropic star and found to be accurate within 10% ( @xcite ) .",
    "once formed , these shocks quickly take a universal , self - similar form ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two regimes are linked by noting that under certain approximations the fluid variables and their equations of motion in the two regimes coincide near the surface .    in sec .",
    "[ section : perturbations ] , we derive the combination of linear non - spherical and planar non - linear fluid motion .",
    "we summarise the ( well - known ) linear perturbation equations for adiabatic non - spherical stellar oscillations in a suitable notation , and their limit near the surface if the density vanishes there .",
    "we present the hodograph transform and the shock formation criterion .",
    "we cast the hodograph equation in a form where it can be identified with the linear perturbation equations near the surface in a high - frequency cowling approximation .",
    "we then evaluate the shock formation criterion on solutions of the linear perturbation equations as if they were solutions of the hodograph equation .    in sec .",
    "[ section : tidal ] , we apply this general formalism to waves raised in a star by the tidal force of its binary companion . we can then use standard methods to calculate the reaction to this force by expanding the perturbations in proper oscillation modes .",

    "[ section : tidal ] has been carried out for @xmath5-modes in nss by @xcite .",
    "their frequency is lower than the orbital frequency at merger , and so the orbital frequency moves through resonance as the orbit shrinks , and the full time - dependent driven oscillator problem must be considered .",
    "it was assumed that no shock forms , and dissipative heating was estimated instead .",
    "it turns out that the duration of the resonance is too short to give rise to significant heating .",
    "by contrast , we focus on @xmath6-modes , which have higher frequencies and are never in resonance , and estimate their amplitude adiabatically in the approximation of a stationary circular orbit .",
