    "spectrum corresponds to a minimum in the spectral energy distribution of the galaxy and of the majority of the extragalactic sources .",
    "this minimum occurs at the cross  over between radio and dust emission , which steeply rises with frequency , and it is only weakly dependent on the relative intensity of the two components ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the relatively large beam sizes and high flux detection limits of current and forthcoming earth , balloon and space  borne experiments ( e.g. , boomerang , vsa , cbi , dasi , acbar , archeops , nasa wmap and esa _ planck _ missions ) imply that only few relatively bright sources can be detected and removed from current as well as future cmb sky maps ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the contribution of the highly undetected extragalactic source populations to cmb temperature fluctuations must be accurately estimated to avoid an unwanted incorrect reconstruction of the angular power spectrum of primordial anisotropies .",
    "this problem is particularly important at intermediate to high multipoles , i.e. @xmath5 , where intrinsic cmb anisotropies are damped .",
    "many estimates of temperature fluctuations arising from a poisson distribution of extragalactic sources have been worked out in the past by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "soon after , a thorough analysis of the extragalactic foreground contributions to small  scale fluctuations over the full wavelength range from @xmath6 cm to @xmath7 @xmath8 m , which improved on previous ones , has been presented by @xcite . assuming a poisson distribution of point sources in the sky , they found that the central frequency channels of the _ planck _ mission will be ` clean ' ( i.e , only a few high latitude pixels will be contaminated by bright undetected sources ) .",
    "as for radio selected extragalactic sources , which contaminate cmb anisotropies at _ planck _ low frequency instrument ( lfi ) channels @xcite , their clustering signal was found to give a generally small contribution to temperature fluctuations , thanks to the broadness of the local luminosity function @xcite and of the redshift distribution of sources which dilute the clustering signal . at higher frequencies ,",

    "the relevant redshift range is considerably limited and the dilution of the clustering signal results relatively reduced ; correspondingly , the amplitute of @xmath3 fluctuations due to clustering is expected to be large . as a preliminary estimate of this signal , have shown that if the sub  mm ( dusty ) galaxies detected by scuba at 850 @xmath8 m do cluster like lyman - break galaxies @xcite , anisotropies due to clustered sources dominate the poisson ones at all angular scales for @xmath11 ghz .",

    "sky maps , we decided to try a different approach for estimating the power spectrum of eps temperature fluctuations .",
    "this approach is based on a fast algorithm capable of simulating all  sky maps as well as sky patches on which eps are distributed following a given two ",
    "point angular correlation function , @xmath1 .",
    "the method , thoroughly explained in sections 2 and 3 and also discussed , albeit partially , by @xcite , works as follows .",
    "first of all , a simulated map of poisson distributed eps is created ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the only basic requirements are : a ) an input model for the number counts ; b ) a fixed value for the pixel size . subsequently , to obtain a map of extragalactic sources whose positions are correlated in the sky , it is necessary to select the _ most reliable _ angular correlation function for that particular source population we want to simulate .",
    "then , by working in the fourier space , we modify the poisson density field by introducing the chosen angular power spectrum , @xmath0 , as discussed in section 2 . finally , after having applied an inverse fourier transform to the map , the fluxes of the simulated sources are distributed in the sky by adopting the same model number counts used in the first step of the process to obtain the poisson density field ( see section 3 ) .",
    "eventually , from this map it is easy to estimate the angular power spectrum of eps by applying the standard fourier analysis .    from the very beginning , we focused on 2d sky maps  thus avoiding the problem of 3d simulations , much more expensive in terms of cpu time  for allowing us the creation of a lot of maps , under the most different assumptions , in relatively short cpu times . moreover , with the purpose of producing all  sky maps which could be used by the cmb community in general and by the _",
    "consortia , in particular , we adopted the standard healpix pixelization scheme of @xcite throughout the paper .",
    "more specifically , we chose a pixel size of 1.718@xmath121.718 arcmin@xmath13 , i.e. nside=2048 ( @xmath14 pixels ) , in the healpix scheme .",
    "as for the flat sky patches , we use the standard angular dimension , @xmath15 deg@xmath13 , and a pixel size of 1.5@xmath121.5 arcmin@xmath13 , unless otherwise stated . in this latter case ,",
    "our simulated maps are thus divided in @xmath16 pixels .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly discuss the basic formalism focussing on the assumptions adopted for efficiently simulating maps of clustered eps .  3 will be devoted to describe the model number counts and the angular correlations functions of extragalactic sources here adopted . in ",
    "4 we present our predictions on the power spectra of temperature fluctuations due to the clustering of ` known ' source populations .",
    "moreover , we discuss the excess power at high multipole recently detected by the cbi and dasi experiments . finally ,  5 summarizes our main conclusions . a flat cosmological model with @xmath17 km / s / mpc , @xmath18 is used throughout the paper .",
    "anyway , we have to remind that our conclusions are only very weakly dependent on the underlying cosmology given that the number counts of extragalactic sources are mainly determined by the evolution with cosmic time of the number density and/or of the emission properties of the underlying source populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we remind here that all the predictions discussed in this paper are based on the assumption of ` point  like ' sources .",
    "as shown by @xcite , this is a good approximation as far as the angular sizes of sources do not exceed the beam width .",
    "this is generally the case in our simulations , since the adopted pixel size ",
    "i.e. , the resolution element of the map  is @xmath19 arcmin@xmath13 and there are very few ( very bright ) low redshift sources in the microwave sky which show angular sizes greater than @xmath6 arcmin .",
    "moreover , the few bright extended sources will be anyway detected and removed by standard or new detection techniques @xcite .      as a preliminary step towards the realization of a flat ( a sky patch ) or spherical ( all  sky ) map of clustered sources , we distribute point sources by adopting a simple poisson distribution for the number , @xmath20 , of sources per pixel .",
    "the mean of @xmath20 is then @xmath21 , i.e. the average number of sources per pixel , which is determined by the total number counts @xmath22 , where @xmath23 indicates the differential source counts and @xmath24 the flux limit for source detection .",
    "] at a given frequency @xmath25 ( see  3 ) .",
    "these sky maps have been already used and discussed in many other papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the reader can refer to them for more details .",
    "therefore , at this first step , the sources are not spatially correlated in the sky .",
    "we then define the _ projected _ density contrast at a given point ( pixel ) as @xmath26 , being @xmath27 the average number of sources per pixel .",
    "therefore , the covariance function of the projected density contrast is the usual two  point angular correlation function ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the angular separation in the sky between the two positions and the brackets indicate an ensemble average . as a following step ,",
    "we calculate the fourier transform of the density contrast    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the angular size of the map we are actually using .",
    "it is very easy to show that the angular power spectrum @xmath32 is the fourier transform of the angular correlation function @xcite . , then @xmath33 . ]",
    "the angular power spectrum depends only on @xmath34 , being the field homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "thus , the basic idea of our method is to obtain _ a density field determined by a given power spectrum _ or , equivalently , by the suitable angular correlation function .",
    "we do this by calculating the fourier transform of the density contrast , @xmath35 , and obtaining its power spectrum , which is constant for all modes , @xmath36 , if sources are poisson distributed in the sky .",
    "subsequently , we introduce the chosen angular power spectrum of correlated sources , @xmath37 , suitable for the particular source population adopted ( see  3.2 . ) , by applying the following formula    @xmath38    then we apply the inverse fourier transform to @xmath39 which allows us the recovering of a new density field , @xmath40 , in which the poisson term has been modified by @xmath37 , i.e. the fourier transform of the chosen angular correlation function , @xmath1 . finally , we calculate    @xmath41    which gives the modified number of point sources at each position in the map , according to the previously calculated new density field , @xmath40 . if @xmath42 in equation ( 3 ) we obtain , again , a pure poisson distribution",
    ".    different angular power spectra can be used for the simulations and they can be derived from the angular correlation @xmath1 , according to the formula of @xcite    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the zeroth - order bessel function .    in this first approach",
    "we have only taken into account the first two moments of the angular distribution , albeit this assumption can not give a full description of the statistical properties of the field .",
    "anyway , as already pointed out by @xcite , this procedure proves `` safe '' given that the total number of bright sources and the number counts remain unchanged after having modified their spatial distribution by the suitable angular correlation function ( see also section 3.2.1 ) .",
    "moreover , the recovered @xmath1 matches the input one quite well .",
    "this result is displayed in figure 1 : in the upper panel we plot four @xmath37 , calculated by equation ( 5 ) , chosen as examples to test the procedure ( see caption ) . among them",
    ", we use the well determined @xmath37 coming from the apm survey @xcite as the reference one for this test .",
    "this angular power spectrum is better determined than the other ones due to the very great number of galaxies in the survey .",
    "in fact , this @xmath37 is the only one which clearly shows the transition from the linear to the non  linear regime . in all the other cases , the data are coming from much shallower surveys on a smaller sky area and , thus , they first converge to a constant value at low multipole . in the lower panel of figure 1",
    "we show the recovered @xmath0 , calculated directly from only one all - sky map : the agreement is very good at all scales , with maximum relative differences @xmath45% .",
    "the difference is slightly higher , @xmath46% , as expected , due to the higher sample variance . ] in this case we plotted the @xmath0 of a single map to show that the angular power spectrum can be well recovered from each map and it is not the result of averaging over @xmath47 simulations . in the same lower panel of figure 1",
    "it is also plotted the average value and the @xmath48 confidence interval of the recovered @xmath0 , after 100 simulations ( in the case of a flat sky patch ) .",
    "the result clearly indicate that the method works well : the slope of the power law @xmath49 is recovered with an error @xmath50% .",
    "notice that the apm @xmath0 is the most difficult one to reconstruct : in all the other cases the reconstruction proves easier , since input @xmath0s are usually fitted by a simple power ",
    "law at all scales where they can be determined .",
    "in the previous subsection we have shown how it is possible to distribute eps in the sky , by using their average number density per pixel , @xmath27 , which is determined only by the number counts at each frequency . in this way we have obtained a pure _ density field _ , characterized by the particular @xmath0 used in each map and by the average number , @xmath27 , of sources per pixel .",
    "now , for converting it to a temperature map , @xmath51 , we have to distribute first the fluxes corresponding to the @xmath52 sources of the total counts .",
    "then , the usual conversion @xmath53 is applied .",
    "firstly , we have to know the differential counts at a given frequency  and , in principle , for each source population  which are giving us the number , @xmath23 , of extragalactic sources in each flux interval . at each frequency where it is estimated",
    ", @xmath23 provides a specific distribution function for fluxes , which mainly depends on the cosmological evolution and on the emission properties of the underlying source populations .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to find an efficient algorithm for distributing fluxes in the map and which satisfies two fundamental requirements : a ) the differential counts should be recovered within the statistical error determined by the sample variance ; b ) the `` input '' angular correlation function has also to be reconstructed , at least down to the flux limit of the sample by which that specific @xmath0 has been determined . as already pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "this is a purely _ phenomenological _ approach aimed at simulating all  sky maps of eps in a fast way and , at the same time , with the guarantee that the two previously quoted requirements are satisfied .    in principle",
    ", one can choose many different ways of distributing fluxes among pixels : e.g. , by simply distributing fluxes under the condition that in a pixel in which there are @xmath47 sources we have to put _ a corresponding number _",
    "@xmath47 of fluxes , taken _ at random _ from the distribution given by the differential counts ; or , e.g. , by imposing that the brightest fluxes fall always in the highest density pixels , thus strengthening , like imposing a `` bias '' factor , the correlation function .",
    "anyway , no matter the method of distributing fluxes you choose , the constraint will be always the same : to fulfil the above quoted , a ) and b ) , fundamental requirements .",
    "to achieve this , and with the purpose of simulating maps of eps at cmb frequencies , we have first exploited the results coming from the analysis of the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) at 1.4 ghz discussed by ( hereafter bw02 ) . by analyzing the great amount of data of this large area survey , the authors are able not only to quantify the angular distribution of radio sources at this frequency but also to give estimates of the @xmath1 for different flux ranges .",
    "therefore , by simulating a clustered distribution of eps at 1.4 ghz we can test the method more deeply : first of all , for the fact that at this frequency the differential counts are well constrained down to a few @xmath8jy and the @xcite(hereafter to98 ) model fits them quite well down to the faintest fluxes ; secondly , for having the possibility of testing the recovered @xmath1 , i.e. the corresponding @xmath37 , in different flux ranges .      as a first approach , we applied the method of _ distributing the fluxes at random _ among pixels and the results",
    "are shown in figure 2 . in each panel of the figure we plot the total @xmath54 , given by the poisson plus the clustering term ; we also represent the input and output @xmath37s ( converted to @xmath54s ) , due to the pure clustering term and for different flux limits , following table 1 of bw02 .",
    "the power spectra are calculated from each map by averaging @xmath55 over the modes with the same @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath54s are then calculated from the @xmath0s just by multiplying them by the patch area , @xmath57 .",
    "notice that when indicating a flux limit , @xmath24 , we do indicate that we have used _ only those pixels with resulting fluxes above _ the quoted @xmath24 for estimating the @xmath37 from the map .",
    "this choice guarantees that we are correctly comparing the angular correlation function of the simulated map with the input one of bw02 .",
    "the maps used for obtaining the results plotted in the _ left panels _ are constructed in the following way : a single map is obtained by summing up 4 different maps  with the different amplitudes of @xmath1 given by bw02  corresponding to the flux ranges @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 mjy and , finally , a map of poisson distributed sources in the range @xmath61 mjy , thus reaching the same @xmath62 on eps counts as the one used by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "each final map  from which the @xmath0s in the _ right panels _ of figure 2 . are calculated  is obtained by only one map in which all sources with @xmath63 mjy are distributed in the sky according to the most accurate determination of @xmath1 given by bw02 ( see caption to figure 2 ) . notice that , _ in all cases _ , we first create the density field , as explained in  2.1 . , and then distribute _ at random _ the fluxes of the sources previously used for the corresponding density field . only sources ( and fluxes ) corresponding to the specific flux range used , at the chosen frequency ( 1.4 ghz ) , are thus distributed in each map .    from figure 2",
    "it is clear that : a ) the input @xmath37 , converted to @xmath54 , is well recovered from the simulated maps for every chosen @xmath24 in agreement with the original bw02 article , taking into account that @xmath37 is obtained by subtracting the poisson term from the total simulated @xmath0 ; b ) the poisson term gives rise to a much greater signal than the clustering term , in all the cases : the total power , @xmath64 , is two / three orders of magnitude above the clustering term .",
    "moreover , the dependence on @xmath56 ( or @xmath65 ) of the poisson and of the clustering term is _ different _ : this well known result is a direct consequence of the increase of the clustering - to - poisson ratio at low multipoles @xcite .",
    "c ) the reconstruction is performed with almost the same precision ",
    "average slopes of the @xmath37 : @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively  by distributing sources using either different amplitudes , @xmath68 , for different flux ranges ( as in table 1 of bw02 ) or by using only one amplitude , the one quoted in the caption of figure 2 .",
    "this is not a surprising outcome , given that bw02 state that _",
    "`` ... the clustering amplitude is also independent of flux '' _ , like the slope of the power ",
    "law , at least in the flux ranges analyzed by them . due to this fact",
    ", one could question our choice of distributing the faintest sources ( and , thus , fluxes ) following a poisson distribution and not by applying the same power ",
    "law used for the brightest ones .",
    "actually , this choice is not relevant in view of simulating maps for low resolution experiments , like wmap and _ planck _ : the much more numerous fainter sources in the beam ( pixel ) dilute the clustering signal and only add some gaussian noise in the pixel ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , it should be taken into account in the case of simulating maps for the analysis of fields observed with much higher resolution , e.g. in the optical band .",
    "the results plotted in figure 2 are quite encouraging and give us confidence in the method .",
    "anyway , for completeness , we have also checked that if we _",
    "force _ the fluxes of the brightest sources to fall in the higher density pixels",
    "we clearly exceed the input value of the selected @xmath1 .",
    "this is an expected result since all our `` input '' angular correlation functions have been determined , as usual , by _ flux selected _ samples of eps , and not by samples of objects defined by using some different selection criterion . on the other hand ,",
    "if we want to reproduce the distribution in the sky of highly clustered source populations , like the dusty spheroids at high redshift , discussed in  3.2.2 , we have to force the brightest sources to fall in the highest density bins . for each particular source population",
    "the correct way of distributing fluxes has to be found , with the constraint of being able to recover the corresponding observed / theorethical @xmath37 ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the proposed method allows to add up _ as many source populations as needed_. however , it shall be generally sufficient to simulate only _ one source population _ , the one which dominate the counts in the flux interval of interest , except for some very specific frequency channel in which two , or more , source populations  showing different clustering properties  are giving a comparable contribution to the counts .",
    "this is a great advantage , which reduces the total required cpu time , and is determined by the fact that the total variance of intensity fluctuations due to eps , @xmath69 , is obtained by adding up in quadrature all the contributions coming from different source populations .",
    ", is given by @xmath70 , where the subindexes @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , indicate a specific source population , and the poisson and clustering terms , respectively , and @xmath74 with @xmath75 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] therefore , the contribution of faint eps populations to the total @xmath76 is generally very small .",
    "eventually , we remind that if we perform the fourier transform of the temperature map , @xmath77 , the temperatute power spectrum of the map is calculated by averaging over the modes with the same k values , @xmath78 . then , in the flat approximation",
    ", @xmath54 can be estimated by @xmath79 , where is @xmath31 is the angular dimension of the sky patch .",
    "as for all  sky maps , the anisotropies of the cmb , @xmath80 , are usually expanded in spherical harmonics    @xmath81    as usual , the angular power spectrum , @xmath54 , is then calculated averaging the coefficients @xmath82 with the same @xmath83 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 are estimated by the routine _ anafast _ of the healpix package .",
    "we have run our code in a sun blade 1000 workstation ultrasparc iii at 750 mhz and with 5 gbytes of ram memory .",
    "the process of creating one all - sky map  by distributing only one eps population  takes from @xmath852 to @xmath8510 hours , depending on the total number of sources ( @xmath86-@xmath87 ) , for nside=2048 ( @xmath14 pixels ) in the healpix scheme .",
    "the total time is determined by the total number of pixels , @xmath88 , and by the total number of sources , @xmath89 in the map : it goes basically as @xmath90 $ ] . the time required to the healpix routine _",
    "`` synfast '' _ for simulating the pure density field at the same resolution is @xmath91 80 minutes .",
    "the rest of the time is determined by the distribution of @xmath92 up to @xmath93 fluxes , depending on the frequency channel and on the source population . on the other hand , a 512@xmath12512 pixels flat patch of the sky",
    "is simulated , by a 2.0 ghz processor with 512 mbytes of ram memory , in only a few seconds at 30 - 100 ghz and in @xmath94 minutes at 857 ghz , for one source population .",
    "obviously , if we distribute in the sky more than one source population , adding up in flux the different simulated fields , the total time is correspondingly increased .",
    "as a benchmark to perform our simulations , we have used the differential counts of the cosmological evolution model for radio selected sources by to98 which successfully account for the observed total number counts down to @xmath95 mjy and up to 8.44 ghz . moreover , also the relative ratio of `` flat''-to-``steep''-spectrum sources is well accounted for by the to98 model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , new results at 15.2 ghz @xcite suggested that the extrapolation of the to98 model counts overestimates their data by a factor of @xmath96 at the survey limit ( @xmath97 mjy ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the recently published analysis of the foreground emission in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) first year data @xcite has provided a full sky catalogue of 208 bright extragalactic sources with fluxes @xmath98 jy , of which only five objects could be spurious identifications .",
    "the whole sample provides an average `` flat '' ( @xmath99 ) energy spectrum in full agreement with the assumptions of to98 , and number counts of bright sources at 41 ghz which appear to fall below the prediction of to98 at 44 ghz by a factor @xmath100 .",
    "however , a direct calculation of the 33 ghz counts by the source catalogue in table 5 of @xcite gives 155 sources at @xmath101 jy on a sky area of 10.38 sr ( @xmath102 ) where the sample appears to be statistically complete . according to table 5 of @xcite .",
    "moreover , by a re - binning of the data in the same table we found that the differential counts of wmap detected sources sink down below @xmath103 jy , suggesting the onset of incompleteness . ] with this latter source selection the average offset , @xmath104 , with the to98 model predictions is slightly reduced .",
    "furthermore , two other recently published independent samples of extragalactic sources at 31 and 34 ghz  from cbi @xcite and vsa @xcite experiments , respectively  show that the to98 model _ correctly _ predicts number counts down to , at least , @xmath105 mjy ( cf .",
    "13 of @xcite ) .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , it is also noticeable that the brightest extragalactic source in the wmap first year catalogue has a flux of @xmath106 jy at 41 ghz which , again , corresponds to the flux for which the to98 model predicts 1 source all over the sky .",
    "another important result is that a good agreement is currently found between predictions based on the to98 model and wmap data on the excess angular power spectrum at small angular scales @xcite as well as on the angular bispectrum detected in the wmap q and v bands @xcite .    on the other hand , a lot of new data on far ",
    "ir / sub  mm source counts have piled up since 1998 , in particular by means of the scuba and mambo surveys .",
    "these current data are better explained by new physical evolution models of far  ir selected sources @xcite .",
    "these models foresee a steeper slope of the differential number counts of eps than the to98 model do at intermediate fluxes , i.e. @xmath107 mjy , where the contribution of high redshift spheroids show up ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in view of this , and for comparing our current estimates on the @xmath54 of eps with the theorethical predictions of @xcite , we have also used the model counts of @xcite at the frequencies of 217 and 353 ghz .",
    "these are relevant frequencies , which correspond to the central channels of _ planck _ hfi , and where the contribution of dusty galaxies to cmb anisotropies should start to dominate over the one coming from radio selected sources .      as for the `` input '' angular correlation function",
    ", we have to use , obviously , the @xmath1 most appropriate to that specific source population we have to simulate ( see also  2.2 . ) . in this paper",
    "we are mostly interested in simulating all  sky maps at cmb frequencies in view of the optimization of current simulations and future data analysis for the _ planck _ mission .",
    "in particular we would like to develop a useful tool for testing the efficiency of algorithms for source detection , for component separation , for detecting non gaussianity in the residual maps and , finally , for better denoising of current as well as of future maps . given the lack of determinations at cmb frequencies , we have , again , to rely on @xmath1s determined at frequencies close to the ones under study .",
    "whereas in the optical domain the very deep large  area surveys of the last decade have provided a lot of very precise determinations of the @xmath1 ",
    "e.g. , apm , 2dfgrs and sdss sky surveys @xcite  only a few determinations of the @xmath1 at radio ( cm ) frequencies are currently available . moreover , at hfi frequencies , the only data up  to  now available on clustering properties of eps are coming from the scuba sky fields .",
    "these fields are of very small angular dimensions and , thus , no clear determination of the @xmath1 at these frequencies has been yet published . some theoretical analysis of the clustering properties of scuba galaxies",
    "have been recently attempted @xcite .",
    "for all the above reasons , and taking into account previous analyses on number counts of eps at cmb frequencies @xcite , we have made the following choices as for the most reliable @xmath1s to be applied in simulations at _ planck _ lfi and hfi frequencies .",
    "all the most recent surveys of radio sources are confirming  with a small offset  the predictions on number counts made by to98 , at least up to @xmath108 ghz (  3.1 . ) .",
    "at these frequencies , the eps relevant at fluxes of interest for current as well as future cmb anisotropy experiments are mainly `` flat''spectrum sources , i.e. qsos , bl lacs and local agns , and , thus , the contributions coming from other fainter source populations can be neglected .",
    "moreover , the number of `` inverted '' spectrum sources  which could have represented a threat for cmb @xmath3 measurements  is found to be always small @xcite .",
    "therefore , we could be confident in adopting the angular correlation function determined by the parkes - mit - nrao survey at 5 ghz @xcite for simulating sky maps of clustered eps sources at _ planck _ lfi frequencies and angular resolutions . on the other hand , when analyzing cmb sky maps coming from high resolution experiments  which probe fainter fluxes ",
    "one can rely on the @xmath1 estimated by from the nvss survey .",
    "this @xmath1 refer to fainter sources than the @xcite one and represents a more realistic approximation to the clustering properties of cbi and bima radio sources ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "in figure 3 , bottom panel , we plot the input differential counts of to98 model at 5 ghz , which match very well the observed ones ( as shown by figure 1 of to98 ) , and they are compared to the ones recovered from only _",
    "one _ simulated map . distribution  down to @xmath109 mjy .",
    "] as it is apparent from figure 3 , the recovering of the differential counts from the simulated maps is achieved with very high precision down to very faint fluxes . in both cases , i.e. poisson and non - poisson ,",
    "the counts recovered form the map start to exceed the input ones by a small factor only at fluxes @xmath110 mjy , whereas they fall rapidly below the input model counts at @xmath111 mjy . level ( 10 sources to be compared with 6 , in a flat sky patch ) . ]",
    "source counts are increased at flux levels much fainter than the flux detection threshold , @xmath112 mjy , calculated at 5 ghz by using the same formalism as in @xcite , to98 for a top  hat square beam of fwhm@xmath94 arcmin and without any other noise added .",
    "therefore , the adopted method does not modify number counts  at least down to the flux level at which eps can be detected with our resolution element  and the clustering term , i.e. the adopted input @xmath1 , only negligibly increases the counts at faint fluxes , as expected in this frequency range .",
    "level @xcite . ]    in the case of poisson distributed sources ( empty circles ) the simulated counts fall below the input ones at @xmath113 mjy , the level at which the to98 model predicts @xmath851 source / pixel , with a pixel size @xmath114 arcmin@xmath13 . in the case of clustered sources , with the @xmath37 here",
    "adopted , the limit of 1 source / pixel is reached at slightly brighter fluxes , i.e. @xmath115 mjy .",
    "mjy is exactly the same as the one lost at fainter fluxes , due to the effect of source confusion with the fast convergence of the counts at @xmath116 mjy . ]    in the top panel of figure 3 we plot the input and recovered @xmath37 of @xcite . at 5 ghz ,",
    "given the shallowness of the survey , we can rely only on a preliminary estimate of @xmath117 for fluxes @xmath118 mjy and we can only apply our method by using a single @xmath1 . therefore , we have distributed eps in the sky in the same way as at 1.4 ghz but as in the case whose results are plotted in the _ right panels _ of figure 2 ( only one @xmath1 for all sources at @xmath63 mjy ) . as for the angular correlation function , the curves plotted in the top panel of figure 3 .",
    "show , again , that the epss2d algorithm is capable of simulating maps of clustered eps in which the input @xmath37 is well recovered .",
    "we chose to represent the result of 1000 simulations ( and the corresponding @xmath119 intervals ) , given that the reduced number of pixels with @xmath118 mjy implies that by only one realization of the sky the simulated @xmath0 results too noisy ( the poisson term always dominates , as clearly shown by the upper thick line ) . anyway , from 100 simulations only we recover an average slope of @xmath37 , @xmath120 and an amplitude whose offset with the input one is @xmath121% and always compatible at the @xmath122 level .",
    "the other plotted curve ( see caption to figure 3 ) shows the effect of the dilution of the clustering signal , when lowering down the flux detection limit , as already discussed in  2.2 .      for simulating sky maps of far ",
    "infrared ( far  ir ) selected eps , which dominate the total number counts at @xmath123 ghz , we have relied on the new physical evolution model for sources recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model , which successfully reproduces the observed counts and the available information on the redshift distribution of scuba sources , describes scuba sources as intermediate and high  redshift proto - spheroidal galaxies mainly observed during their principal burst of star formation , whose evolution and duration is substantially affected by the growth and by the activity of a central super  massive black hole and not only by supernova feedback . obviously , spheroidal galaxies ( spheroids ) are not the only source population contributing to number counts at far  ir and sub  millimeter wavebands",
    "type galaxies , i.e. normal spiral , irregular and starburst galaxies , dominate the bright tail of number counts whereas spheroids provide , by far , the overwhelming contribution to @xmath23 in _ planck _ hfi channels for @xmath124 mjy . on the other hand ,",
    "late  type galaxies are relatively weakly clustered ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , thus , their contribution to confusion noise turns out to be dominated by poisson fluctuations @xcite .",
    "scuba sources are expected to show a strong spatial clustering , similar to the one measured for extremely red objects ( eros ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , direct measurements of clustering properties of these sources is made difficult by the poor statistics .",
    "however , @xcite found some evidence for clustering of the background source population in the hubble deep field observed at 850 @xmath8 m and tentative evidences of strong clustering , consistent with that found for eros , have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "the power in excess over poisson fluctuations detected by @xcite is well accounted for by a two  point angular correlation function of the form @xmath125 with @xmath126 in the range 12 arcsec .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the above value of @xmath126 is consistent with a number of data on clustering of scuba sources and can be well accounted for by a @xmath1 derived from physical assumptions on the evolution of clustering @xcite . in the framework of this physical evolution model for clustering , @xcite worked out a complete set of predictions on the angular power spectrum due to eps sources at hfi frequencies . given that we are currently interested in testing our algorithm for distributing clustered sources in cmb sky maps , in the following we adopt the @xmath1 of @xcite and the number counts of spheroids of @xcite for simulating all - sky maps of far  ir selected eps .",
    "therefore , from these maps we have to recover the same theoretical @xmath54 values of @xcite .",
    "figure 4 and 5 display our current results on the temperature angular power spectrum , @xmath54 , due to clustered eps at the _ planck _",
    "channels 30 , 100 , 217 and 353 ghz by applying the epss2d algorithm .",
    "notice that each plotted @xmath54 has been calculated from only one all - sky map of eps , following the method explained in  2 and with the assumptions made in  3 .",
    "however , for giving a confidence interval , we also plot the @xmath119 levels around the mean , having performed 100 simulations of flat sky patches . as in @xcite , to98 we represent the quantity @xmath127 ( in units of k ) .",
    "as discussed in  3.2.1 , due to the relatively large beam area ( i.e. , bright detection limits ) of current as well as future all - sky cmb anisotropy experiments , we can be confident in simulating 2d all  sky maps by using only `` flat''spectrum cm selected radio eps at @xmath128 ghz .",
    "the angular power spectrum , @xmath37 , determined by using the angular correlation function of @xcite has been used , as before , given that the parent population of bright sources , i.e. blazars , is the same one as at 5 ghz .",
    "we rely on this choice since current earth  borne as well as satellite surveys are confirming that other source populations , i.e. inverted spectrum sources , are almost not sampled at bright fluxes if @xmath128 ghz @xcite . from figure 4",
    "it is clear that the recovered @xmath54s of clustered eps are still compatible with the ones recovered from a poisson distribution of sources @xcite .",
    "the contribution of clustered eps sources to temperature cmb fluctuations at these frequencies is _ found to be negligible at all angular scales _ , `` if sources are not subtracted down to fluxes well below the detection limit of the survey , thus greatly decresing the poisson fluctuations , while the contribution arising from clustering is only weakly affected '' @xcite .",
    "in fact , if only bright sources at @xmath129 jy are subtracted out from the map ",
    "e.g. , the detection limit of the wmap survey ",
    "the @xmath54 of clustered eps still match very well the predictions of to98 .",
    "these results are , again , in agreement with the well known observational result : `` the wide redshift range of radio sources washes out much of the clustering signal '' ( bw02 ) . from the same figure 4 it is possible to appreciate a small excess at the largest angular scales in the estimated @xmath54s , of clustered eps , if compared to the ones estimated by to98 .",
    "this is in agreement with the well known outcome that the ratio of clustering  to  poisson fluctuations increases with increasing angular scale , i.e. at decreasing multipole number ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath54 of clustered dusty proto - spheroidal galaxies at 100 ghz ( see figure 4 ) confirms previous findings of @xcite on the confusion noise : the poisson term due to radio selected sources is always the dominant one at all multipoles at @xmath128 ghz . on the other hand , at @xmath130 ghz spheroids probably dominate the fluctuations due to eps.% .",
    "as an example , at 100 and 143 ghz we find @xmath131 mjy , respectively , at the planck resolution , to be compared with the values @xmath132 mjy quoted by @xcite and by using the same detection thresholds .",
    "the contribution of spheroidal galaxies is almost insensitive to the adopted flux limit , because of the very steep counts at bright fluxes . ]    in figure 5 we plot our current outcomes at 217 and 353 ghz by using the eps counts of spheroidal galaxies of @xcite ( see  3.2.2 ) and by applying the @xmath1 discussed in @xcite . in this case ,",
    "due to the very strong angular correlation function detected by scuba @xcite , for recovering the input @xmath133 , we have to force the brightest fluxes to fall in the highest density pixels . from figure 5",
    "it is clear that a very good agreement is found between the recovered @xmath54s and the theoretical predictions of @xcite , at all multipoles .",
    "the small scatter around the average value , displayed by the @xmath119 confidence intervals , shows that we can be confident in the @xmath54s recovered from each simulated map .",
    "as previously noticed , at 217 ghz ( 3rd _ planck _ hfi channel ) a comparable contribution to bright eps counts is expected either from spheroidal galaxies and from radio selected `` flat''spectrum sources .",
    "anyway , given that this latter population is much less clustered and , moreover , thanks to the dilution of the clustering signal  due to their flat luminosity function and broad redshift distribution ",
    "the contribution of `` flat''spectrum eps falls below the one coming from spheroids ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at 353 ghz ,",
    "spheroids starts to dominate the counts at very bright fluxes and , thus , if they are strongly clustered as suggested by scuba surveys @xcite their @xmath54s are no doubt the dominant ones . as for other far",
    " ir selected source populations , they give a small to negligible contribution to cmb temperature fluctuations , since they are much less clustered ( see  3.2.2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we can be sufficiently confident in our current results .",
    "recent cmb experiments , aimed at probing arcmin angular scales , i.e. dasi , bima amd cbi , respectivey @xcite , have tentatively detected a signal at high multipoles well in excess on predictions for primordial cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "the interpretation of these outcomes is still open .",
    "possible interpretations are in terms of the thermal sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) @xcite signal associated to the formation of spheroidal galaxies @xcite or in terms of the sz effect in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "however , all these interpretations require very high values of the @xmath135 normalization . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission from advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) around supermassive black - holes in early - type galaxies is found to be not sufficient to explain the detected excess @xcite .",
    "undetected eps can represent an alternative ( or , at least , a partial ) explanation to the excess .",
    "given that extragalactic sources are , very probably , the dominant contributor to cmb fluctuactions at these small angular scales , they have to be carefully subtracted out . and ,",
    "indeed , all the quoted works devoted a great effort to this subject . in figure 6 ( bottom panel )",
    "we plot , as an example , the @xmath54 due to poisson distributed eps , as estimated by @xcite and our prediction at 30 ghz by using the to98 model counts and a detection limit @xmath136 mjy for sources .",
    "the very good agreement between our current results and those estimates confirms , again , that the to98 model still holds well , down to fluxes of tens of mjy at @xmath137 ghz ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "moreover , this agreement also implies that source clustering _ can not _",
    "add a relevant contribution to the observed signal , as previously discussed .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , a quite substantial residual contribution of radio selected sources to the cbi signal is difficult to rule out , whereas the residual contamination of the bima data should be , very likely , smaller .",
    "all published estimates of eps contamination of cmb maps at high multipoles have used a poisson distribution of extragalactic sources . by our simulation code and the to98 model counts we can now assess , with good confidence , the excess contribution due to clustered eps sources . in figure 6",
    "we plot the total noise ( poisson+clustering ; continuous line ) and the pure clustering term ( dotted lines ) given by radio selected sources following the to98 source counts .",
    "we model the clustering term by using the @xmath1 of @xcite and bw02 as discussed in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "the top panel of figure 6 shows that undetected sources below @xmath138 mjy , the most recent detection limit quoted by @xcite , can easily explain the excess . if we guess that radio selected sources do cluster down to very faint flux limits ( @xmath109 mjy ) following the @xmath1 of @xcite , then the clustering term should give a non negligible contribution ( @xmath139-@xmath140k ) to the total fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "if we adopt the @xmath1 of bw02 , which can represent a more realistic approximation to the clustering properties of faint undetected sources in the cbi fields , since we are dealing with very faint sources not sampled by the nrao - vla survey , the additional power due to clustering ( @xmath141-@xmath142k ) is indeed very small in comparison with the poisson term .    as for the bima data plotted in figure 6",
    ", our current estimates do indicate that poisson distributed and clustered eps selected at radio frequencies are the dominant contributor to the detected excess , by adopting the effective detection limit @xmath143jy , below which the counts of detected sources sink down @xcite , and by keeping the same assumptions as before for their clustering properties . on the other hand , at the very faint flux limits ( down to @xmath144 mjy ) probed by the bima experiment other source populations  undetectable at brighter fluxes ",
    "the detailed analysis of @xcite shows that high - redshift dusty proto - spheroidal galaxies in the main phase of star formation @xcite are contributing to arcmin cmb fluctuations even at frequencies as low as @xmath145 ghz .",
    "moreover , if these sources show the mm excess detected in several galactic clouds as well as in nearby galaxies , their contribution to cmb fluctuations would be higher and , when summed in quadrature to the contribution of radio selected sources , would imply a signal only marginally consistent with the bima data .",
    "as an application , we have combined current wmap data on eps @xcite with our 2d simulation code for creating a _ realistic map _ of eps in the submillimeter domain .",
    "obviously , it is necessary to follow a four  step process : first of all , we use the epss-2d code for simulating an all  sky map at 70 ghz by using the same assumptions made in  3.2.1 and distributing only sources with fluxes @xmath95 jy .",
    "this flux density roughly corresponds to the source detection limit of the wmap k and q channels , in which the wmap survey reaches the highest number of detections .",
    "subsequently , the flux densities , @xmath146 , of all wmap sources have been converted to the corresponding values at _ planck _ lfi frequencies , by using the spectral indexes published by @xcite . among all fluxes , the ones measured at 61 ghz  by the wmap v channel  have been used as the reference values for converting them to 70 ghz , given that this is the wmap channel closest to the frequency of the map . in the case of a no detection in the v channel , the flux measured in the q channel has been used ; alternatively , the density flux of the k channel has been exploited , in such a way that we could convert all fluxes to our frequency .    then , every source in the wmap 1year catalogue has been placed in that specific pixel of the healpix ( nside=2048 ) pixelization scheme corresponding to the published galactic coordinates of the source .",
    "notice that , after having determined the position of each wmap source , i.e. the corresponding healpix pixel , we have _ put to zero _ the flux previously simulated by our code in that particular pixel .",
    "finally , we assign to each `` zero  flux '' pixel the flux ( or , equivalently , the temperature ) of the wmap source corresponding to that position .",
    "moreover , we have also checked that all the simulated fluxes which fall inside a ring  of the dimension of the wmap fwhm  around each wmap source are not greater than the corresponding error in flux of the wmap 1-year eps catalogue .",
    "this choice guarantees that we can exactly recover the fluxes of all the brightest ",
    "wmap detected  sources from our map , shown in figure 7 .",
    "this map is a very realistic realization of the eps sky at 70 ghz given that it combines the wmap catalogue ( bright detected sources ) and realistic 2d simulations ( faint sources ) , as discussed before .",
    "moreover , as soon as the 2-year wmap catalogue shall be available , this same map , as well as other maps of eps at other frequencies @xmath147 ghz , can be easily and rapidly updated .",
    "we have presented predictions on the angular power spectrum of eps by 2d simulated maps in which extragalactic sources are distributed with correlated positions in the sky .",
    "the code , named epss-2d , is able to simulate both sky patches and all  sky maps taking short cpu process times in a common workstation ( see  2.2.1 ) .",
    "we want to stress again that we adopted a purely _ phenomenological _ approach given that our main purpose was the definition of a fast and flexible tool for simulating 2d maps of eps , under the most general assumptions on source counts and on the angular correlation functions of point sources .",
    "the present outcomes are , obviously , _",
    "model dependent_. on the other hand , they try to take into account all current data on eps counts as well as on source clustering .",
    "all these simulated maps can be very useful for studying the effect of clustered eps , in view of estimating the cmb angular power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "\\1 ) 2d maps are created by first making a poisson density field , corresponding to the differential counts of eps , @xmath23 , which have been determined or estimated at the frequency under study ; subsequently , we modify  in the fourier space  this `` white noise '' density field according to some angular power spectrum , @xmath0 , the most reliable one for that specific source population , whose differential counts have been used ; as a final step , we distribute fluxes on the density field map , under the condition that @xmath47 fluxes  taken from the differential counts  fall in a pixel whose number of sources is @xmath47 .",
    "this method , discussed in detail in  2 , proves `` safe '' given that we are always able to recover the input source counts and the input @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the proposed method allows us to estimate also the contribution of clustered eps to the cmb bispectrum @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) the method allows , in principle , the simulation of as many eps populations as needed , provided that their contribution to the differential counts at a given frequency is known . on the other hand , in almost all the cases it will be sufficient to only distribute in the sky those eps coming from the dominant source population at a given frequency , thus making the simulation simpler and faster .",
    "this is generally the case , except in some very particular frequency range , in which number counts  at fluxes relevant for a particular experiment  are contributed by a comparable number of sources coming from two ( or more ) source populations which show different clustering properties ( see  2.2.2 ) .",
    "\\3 ) by using the toffolatti et al . cosmological evolution model for eps and by applying the @xmath148 of @xcite we have estimated the temperature angular power spectrum of clustered eps at wmap and _ planck _ lfi frequencies .",
    "our current results confirm that the extra power due to clustering of eps is _ always small _ in comparison with the poisson term in all cases for which no subtraction of bright sources is applied ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "as extensively discussed in the body of the paper , the present outcome is in full agreement with all the main studies on the subject .",
    "\\4 ) on the other hand , we find that at frequencies @xmath149 ghz , the contribution of the clustering term , @xmath150 , to the total confusion noise can be , very probably , the dominant one , thus confirming previous theoretical predictions .",
    "this result is mainly determined by the very steep slope of eps counts at sub ",
    "mm wavelengths combined with the strong clustering signal inferred for high redshift spheroidal galaxies and scuba sources @xcite .",
    "\\5 ) our current simulations allows us to also estimate the contribution of clustered eps to the excess signal recently detected at arcmin scales by the cbi and bima fields . our current findings , which  as stated before ",
    "are model dependent , suggest that clustering of eps can give a small but not negligible contribution to this excess .",
    "\\6 ) we present here , as an example , a realistic all  sky map of clustered eps sources at 70 ghz .",
    "this map has been obtained by combining the wmap point source catalogue , converted to 70 ghz , and a map of fainter eps at the same frequency , simulated by the epss2d code .",
    "as previously discussed , this map and other ones at wmap and _ planck _ lfi frequencies are easily simulated , thanks to the currently available wmap 1year data .",
    "the lack of data at higher cmb frequencies makes a map of this kind much more uncertain .",
    "finally , we remind that we can very easily update our current analysis and results : e.g. , by taking into account more source populations , for providing more accurate estimates on the @xmath54s of eps . as for the simulated all - sky maps",
    ", we can easily update them by the epss2d code and by exploiting the 2-year wmap source catalogue in the next future .",
    "it is important to stress again that current and future applications of these maps are manifold : first of all , they allow the direct estimate of @xmath54s due to eps , under very general assumptions ; they shall be useful in testing the capability of new algorithms for the detection of eps in presence of correlated positions in the sky ; they shall also allow us to test the efficiency of component separation techniques ; eventually , they can be of some help in the study of non gaussian signatures in residue cmb maps . therefore",
    ", we intend to make publicly available the maps created by our epss2d simulation code .",
    "we hope that they shall be useful to all the research community devoted to the development of current as well future cmb anisotropy experiments .",

    "<S> we present predictions on the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations due to extragalactic point sources ( eps ) by using a method for simulating realistic 2d distributions of clustered eps . </S>",
    "<S> both radio and far  ir selected source populations are taken into account . to analyze different clustering scenarios , we exploit angular power spectra of eps , @xmath0 , estimated either by data coming from currently available surveys or by means of theoretical predictions .    by adopting the source number counts predicted by the toffolatti et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1998 ) evolution model  </S>",
    "<S> capable of accounting well for the available data at radio cm wavelengths  we are able to reproduce current data on the two  point angular correlation functions , @xmath1 , of radio sources </S>",
    "<S> . we can confirm that the detection of primordial cmb anisotropies is not hampered by undetected clustered sources at frequencies @xmath2 ghz . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> our current findings show that at higher frequencies the clustering signal could severely reduce the detectability of intrinsic cmb anisotropies , thus confirming previous theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that unsubtracted eps can account for the excess signal at high multipoles detected by recent cmb anisotropy experiments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the additional power due to the clustering of sources gives rise to a small but not negligible contribution to the same excess signal . as a final result </S>",
    "<S> , we also present an example of a currently feasible _ realistic map _ of eps at 70 ghz , by taking into account data on bright detected sources as well as the previously quoted model for number counts .    </S>",
    "<S> eventually , these simulated sky maps can prove very useful to test the efficiency of component separation techniques , the capability of new algorithms for the detection of eps and the appearance of non gaussian signatures in `` residue '' cmb maps , in the presence of sources which are not poisson distributed in the sky .    -0.8truecm </S>"
