    "the mid 1980s saw a shift in the nature of the relationship between mathematics and physics .",
    "differential equations and geometry applied in a classical setting were no longer the principal players ; in the quantum world topology and algebra began to move to the fore .",
    "this was a result of extracting the topological aspects of a quantum field theory , largely attributed in its infancy to witten , for example in @xcite .",
    "the move to a formal mathematical theory came in 1989 with atiyah s axiomatisation of a topological quantum field theory ( tft ) @xcite .",
    "these ideas have since shown themselves to have applications to both topology ( low dimensional manifolds ) and physics ( string theory ) alike .    roughly speaking ,",
    "a closed @xmath0-dimensional tft is a functor from a category whose objects are closed oriented @xmath1-manifolds ( disjoint unions of circles ) , and whose morphisms are homeomorphism classes of oriented surfaces , to the category of complex vector spaces .",
    "it is well known that closed @xmath0-dimensional tfts are in one - to - one correspondence with commutative frobenius algebras .",
    "explicitly , the image of the circle @xmath2 under such a theory is an algebra of this form and , conversely , for any such algebra @xmath3 there exists a theory @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "proofs of this folk theorem have been given by abrams @xcite and kock @xcite .",
    "atiyah s axiomatisation can be extended in two ways .",
    "firstly , we can drop the assumption that all objects ( @xmath1-manifolds ) in the category are closed , requiring them only to be compact .",
    "this leads to the notion of _ open - closed _ and _ open _ tfts , where for the latter we insist that the objects have boundary",
    ". theories of this form have also been classified .",
    "moore and segal @xcite showed that open @xmath0-dimensional tfts are equivalent to symmetric frobenius algebras . in the open - closed case",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence with `` knowledgeable frobenius algebras '' ( see lauda and pfeiffer @xcite for a definition and proof ) .    the second way in which we can extend the axiomatisation is by allowing non - orientable surfaces in the category .",
    "field theories of this form are known as _ klein",
    "_ tfts . turaev and",
    "turner @xcite proved that closed @xmath0-dimensional klein tfts correspond to finite dimensional commutative frobenius algebras with additional structure coming from the non - orientable generators of the surface category .",
    "open klein tfts are equivalent to symmetric frobenius algebras with some extra structure , as shown by braun @xcite . finally , open - closed klein theories correspond to `` structure algebras '' ( see alexeevski and natanzon @xcite for a definition and proof ) .    here",
    "we are interested in invertible @xmath0-dimensional tfts , that is to say tfts for which the defining functor @xmath4 is morphism inverting .",
    "these play an important role in ordinary quantum field theory , for example as anomalies , and over recent years have proven crucial in the understanding of the subject . for orientable surfaces",
    "invertible tfts have been classified , in the closed case by the second author @xcite and in the open - closed case by douglas @xcite .",
    "our aim is to extend these results to the corresponding non - orientable cases , and also to give a classification in the open case which has not previously been considered .",
    "the previous classifications have been dependent on a particular choice of model for the cobordism categories considered . though this is convenient for computations , it is unsatisfactory in terms of the general theory .",
    "here we make our classification independent of such a choice and determine the category of tfts on any model for the cobordism categories , up to natural equivalence .",
    "to do so we are forced to consider the category of ( pointed ) symmetric monoidal functors and prove that the equivalence class of such a functor category does not change when the source or target categories are replaced by equivalent symmetric monoidal categories .",
    "our interest in tft lies not only with the functors themselves , but also with the surface categories involved . by studying their localisations , i.e.  the categories obtained by inverting all morphisms",
    ", one can gain an understanding of the underlying combinatorics of these categories . here",
    "we adapt the methods of @xcite in order to analyse the localisation of the non - orientable cobordism categories .",
    "we are able to compute them in all three cases , obtaining the desired classification of invertible field theories as a corollary . for completeness sake",
    "we have also included proofs for the orientable cobordism categories .",
    "the categorical problem at hand is the discrete version of an extended problem , in which one includes diffeomorphism of surfaces in the categorical data . in @xcite galatius ,",
    "madsen , the second author and weiss showed that there is a weak equivalence between the classifying space of the extended @xmath6-dimensional cobordism category @xmath7 and the infinite loop space of a certain thom spectrum .",
    "this result can be interpreted to calculate the extended invertible tfts in the setting of @xcite .",
    "we refer to the recent article by freed @xcite for a survey of the discrete and extended cobordism categories and the tfts they define , along with various examples and further applications .",

    "in particular , we show that when the domain is , , or @xmath13 the category of invertible tfts is equivalent to the discrete category of non - zero complex numbers , see theorem 4.3 .",
    "in section 5 we consider the classifying spaces of our cobordism categories and relate our results to those in @xcite and @xcite .",

    ", we make the following observations .",
    "firstly , for a cobordism of genus @xmath69 and type @xmath70 , the two possible choices ( boundary maps are both inclusions or boundary maps are both reflections ) lie in the same homeomorphism class . similarly , for a cobordism of genus @xmath69 and type @xmath1 the two possible choices define the same morphism . finally , there is no homeomorphism between an orientable cobordism of genus @xmath69 and type @xmath70 , and an orientable cobordism of genus @xmath69 and type @xmath1 , which commutes with all boundary maps .",
    "thus the type of an orientable morphism is well - defined .",

    "morphisms in @xmath71 are determined by their genera and their type . in terms of genera ,",
    "composition in @xmath71 corresponds to addition .",
    "if two morphisms in @xmath71 have the same type , then their composition will always have type @xmath70 .",
    "however , composing two morphisms of different types gives a morphism of type @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that the type of a morphism lies in the group @xmath72 .",
    "we therefore identify @xmath73 where the element @xmath74 stands for the unique morphism in @xmath71 of genus @xmath69 and type @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , we can consider the subcategory @xmath76 of whose morphisms are non - orientable cobordisms along with the cylinder .",
    "for non - orientable surfaces , the type of a cobordism does not carry through to a well - defined notion of morphism type .",
    "this is precisely because a cobordism from @xmath2 to @xmath2 with @xmath77 crosscaps and type @xmath70 lies in the same homeomorphism class as a cobordism from @xmath2 to @xmath2 with @xmath78 crosscaps and type @xmath1 . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath25 be the mbius band with one disc removed considered as a cobordism from @xmath2 to @xmath2 of type @xmath1 .",

    "the surface on the right of figure  [ mobiusslide ] is the punctured mbius band @xmath79 of type @xmath70 .",

    "composition in @xmath76 corresponds to addition .",
    "it follows that @xmath76 is identifiable with the monoid @xmath81 , where @xmath60 acts as an identity for all elements other than itself and the cylinder @xmath58 . using notation compatible with that used for @xmath71",
    ", we can identify @xmath82 where the relation is @xmath83 for non - zero @xmath78 .",

    "the second equality holds as any invertible functor factors uniquely through the localisation of the source category . by theorem 3.6 , @xmath395 and by the example following definition a.12 , @xmath396 .",
    "the third equivalence therefore follows by an application of proposition a.8 .",
    "functors of abelian groups are symmetric monoidal and are group homomorphisms .",
    "any group homomorphism from @xmath16 is determined by its image on 1 .",
    "the latter identity is thus to be interpreted as an identity of sets , or equivalently , of categories with only identity morphisms .    in a more hands on approach ,",

    "the same arguments as were used to classify functors @xmath352 prove that the functors are precisely of the form as claimed . we now show that any @xmath399 can be given a unique structure of a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath405 .    by considering the lower two diagrams of definition  [ def : based symmetric monoidal functor ] , and as and @xmath390 are both strict monoidal categories , we see that the isomorphisms @xmath406 must satisfy @xmath407 the @xmath408 must also be natural , and using the above equation we see that @xmath409 one checks that this also satisfies the symmetry axiom ( the upper right hand diagram of definition  [ def : based symmetric monoidal functor ] ) .",

    "the involutive automorphism is the identity , and the element @xmath435 is equal to @xmath443 .",
    "the cobordism hypothesis as treated in @xcite is most naturally a statement about @xmath444-categories and their functors . in this",
    "setting higher homotopies play an important role .",
    "thus , instead of factoring through the localisation , invertible functors are those that factor through the classifying space of the cobordism category appropriately interpreted , compare @xcite . hence in that setting",
    "we need to understand the homotopy type of the classifying spaces in order to compute the invertible topological field theories . for the @xmath445-category @xmath446 associated to @xmath66",
    "this has been done in @xcite where its classifying space is shown to be homotopic to the infinite loop space of a certain thom spectrum .",
    "we consider here the classifying spaces of our discrete categories .",
    "for any category @xmath129 we denote its classifying space by @xmath447 , recalling that this is by definition the geometric realisation of the nerve @xmath448 .",

    "hence , having computed the localisation of a category , it is natural to ask what its classifying space might be .",
    "we briefly recall the following three useful facts regarding classifying spaces .",
    "firstly , a functor @xmath450 induces a map @xmath451 .",
    "secondly , for product categories we have @xmath452 . finally , a natural transformation between two functors @xmath453 induces a homotopy @xmath454 @xcite .",
    "it follows that a pair of adjoint functors @xmath455 and @xmath456 ( and in particular an equivalence of categories ) induces a homotopy equivalence @xmath457 .",
    "as before , let @xmath458 denote the group completion of a monoid @xmath37 , that is the target of a universal homomorphism from @xmath37 to a group , and let @xmath459 denote the loop space functor .",
    "the canonical homomorphism @xmath460 induces a natural transformation @xmath461 which is a weak equivalence when @xmath37 satisfies certain properties as defined by quillen @xcite .",
    "in particular , this map is a weak equivalence when @xmath37 is abelian .",
    "it follows that @xmath462 for abelian monoids @xmath37 .",
    "hence for a category @xmath129 with abelian monoid structure we have @xmath463 $ ] induced by the canonical projection @xmath464 $ ] .",
    "recall that @xmath465 is the circle and @xmath466 is the infinite real projective space .",
    "our analysis of the subcategories in section 2 and theorem 3.3 immediately give us the following .",
    "there are homotopy equivalences @xmath467    our description of the categories lets us also describe the maps between the categories up to homotopy .",
    "thus for example , the map @xmath468 induced by the inclusion @xmath469 is homotopic to @xmath470 , while the map @xmath471 induced by the inclusion @xmath472 is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "the computation of the localisations in section 3 immediately imply the following .",
    "the fundamental groups of classfying spaces can be identified as @xmath473 and @xmath474 the inclusion of @xmath183 into induces the multiplication by 2 map .",
    "the computation of the localisations of the cobordism categories gives the first homotopy groups of their classifying spaces . in the case of monoids ,",
    "this completely determines the homotopy type of their classifying spaces , as we have seen in corollary 5.1 . in those cases",
    "all higher homotopy groups are trivial .",
    "we conjecture that the same is true also for our main categories .    on classifying spaces the canonical maps from @xmath475 and the orientable subcategories to their respective localisations induce homotopy equivalences .",
    "in particular this would mean that @xmath15 induces on classifying spaces a homotopy equivalence with @xmath2 in the cases of , , and their orientable subcategories , and with @xmath476 in case of .",
    "the analogue of the above conjecture for the closed cobordism category for orientable surfaces @xmath477 has been outstanding many years , compare @xcite .",

    "we note that up to homotopy , any cw - complex is the classifying space of a discrete category and any infinite loop space is the classifying space of a symmetric monoidal category .",
    "we offer the following result in partial support of the above conjecture .",
    "[ monoidalcat ] let @xmath478 or one of their orientable subcategories .",
    "then there exists a simply connected infinite loop space @xmath99 ( depending on @xmath479 ) such that @xmath480 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath481 .",

    ".    we will only discuss the case @xmath484 .",

    "see also @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the classifying space of a connected symmetric strict monoidal category has the homotopy type of an infinite loop space @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , a symmetric monoidal functor induces a map of infinite loop spaces on the classifying spaces of two such categories .",
    "since the euler characteristic is additive with respect to disjoint union , it follows that the induced map @xmath485 is a map of infinite loop spaces .",
    "the composition @xmath486 is @xmath487 , in other words it is the canonical map @xmath488 composed with an isomorphism .",
    "therefore the induced map on classifying spaces is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "it follows that @xmath15 has a section , that is a map @xmath489 with @xmath490 .",
    "let @xmath99 be the homotopy fibre of @xmath485 , and denote the map @xmath491 by @xmath492 .",
    "note that @xmath99 is an infinite loop space , since @xmath15 is a map of infinite loop spaces .",
    "we show that @xmath99 is simply connected , and that the map @xmath493 defined by @xmath494 is a weak equivalence , where the product @xmath495 on @xmath496 is the loop product .    since @xmath15 has a section , the long exact sequence in homotopy @xmath497 splits as short exact sequences @xmath498 .",
    "considering this short exact sequence in dimensions @xmath499 and @xmath500 , we see that @xmath99 is simply connected .",
    "we therefore have split short exact sequences of abelian groups in every dimension , and hence isomorphisms @xmath501 given by @xmath502\\mapsto\\phi_*[x]s_*[y]$ ] .",
