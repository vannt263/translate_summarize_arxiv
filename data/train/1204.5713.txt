    "<S> , width=302 ]    in conclusion , we have discussed a scheme realizing the replication of entanglement , based on the interface of a driving two - mode entangled field with two distant and independent dissipative many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> the replication mechanism works efficiently both for arrays of discrete- and continuous - variable systems . </S>",
    "<S> since the phenomenon occurs in the steady state of the irreversible driven - dissipative dynamics , it exhibits an intrinsic robustness against the detrimental effects of noise . </S>",
    "<S> we have highlighted the roles played by quantum interference and the competition between dissipation , driving , and interactions in producing such a steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding entanglement is robust against deviations from ideal conditions including a nonvanishing thermal component of the driving field , asymmetries between the arrays , and decay of the cavity fields . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , the replication mechanism yields an arbitrary number of maximally entangled pairs and is scale - free in the sense that it is independent of the actual length of the arrays . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is a potentially valuable resource for remote quantum communication and distributed quantum computation  @xcite that could be combined with other driven - dissipative strategies for the realization of scalable quantum networks @xcite . seen from a different viewpoint , this scheme implements a protocol of long - distance entanglement distribution  @xcite and nested entangled - pair production  @xcite , two key tasks for quantum networking , achieved via the interactions intrinsic in many - body systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the outlined scheme is general and flexible enough to find application in many systems which effectively realize chains of harmonic oscillators or spins , such as cavity / circuit - qed  @xcite , arrays of optomechanical systems , trapped ions , or ultracold atoms in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism could be verified with arrays of coupled resonators , recently produced in photonic crystals @xcite , which realize chains of linearly coupled harmonic oscillators . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the cavities are almost resonant and they interact with nearest - neighbor couplings of strength within the range @xmath109 ghz . these values can be tailored by selecting the distance between the cavities . </S>",
    "<S> the reported cavity line - width is of the order of @xmath110 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters are consistent with those discussed in our analysis . however , the broadest squeezing at the wavelength of the resonators of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( @xmath111 @xmath112 m ) has a bandwidth of about @xmath113 ghz  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this value is still relatively small and does not well satisfy the broadband condition assumed throughout our work . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , larger squeezing bandwidths and photonic - crystal nano - cavities with weaker decay rates are expected to be realizable in the near future  @xcite , thus matching the required condition . on the other hand , the currently available experimental situation might already suffice for testing the entanglement replication mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a relevant theoretical question , which deserves further investigation , is whether entanglement replication holds also for driving squeezed fields of finite bandwidth .    </S>",
