    "motivated by the observation of thermonuclear supernovae that seem to require exploding white dwarf masses above the celebrated chandrasekhar limit  @xcite , a series of papers by mukhopadhyay and collaborators  @xcite explored the magnetized version of the stellar structure and argued for a substantial increase of the maximum possible mass for large values of the magnetic field @xmath2 , which quantizes the electronic energy levels .",
    "a great deal of interest followed this suggestion , which has been addressed in a number of works .",
    "the main criticisms include an inconsistency with the virial theorem  @xcite for the achievement of large maximum mass values and similar basic facts .",
    "however , the authors have responded to these criticisms , and the issue of the existence of these compact stars is still an open and important question .    on the theoretical point of view",
    ", the construction of fully consistent equilibrium solutions in the magnetized regime is still lacking , although hints for their existence and stability have been pointed out  @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the magnetic field seems to be an important ingredient for this issue , while the behavior of matter under extreme conditions leads to a consideration of the equation of state in the landau regime for the electron energy levels , which may change the effective description in terms of polytropic indexes and related quantities .",
    "therefore , a step forward towards the solution of this problem would be the investigation of the stability of stellar models for highly magnetized matter and identify the threshold values of @xmath2 for the disappearance of stable solutions .",
    "we perform in this letter such an analysis within a definite relativistic framework and show that , at least within these simplified models , the magnetic field admitted on theoretical grounds can not exceed @xmath3  g. moreover , we confirm that the maximum masses do not grow beyond the chandrasekhar value when the magnetic pressure is properly introduced via the stress - energy tensor .",
    "a brief discussion of the theoretical situation of putative high - mass white dwarfs closes this work .",
    "the scalar virial theorem  @xcite has been generally employed to estimate that the maximum magnetic field that a wd can sustain with a mass @xmath4 and a radius @xmath5 is around @xmath6  g. this values strongly suggest that a realistic model of a magnetized wd should feature quantized energy levels for the electrons , as in many attempts to construct models that describe the microphysics of wds as a magnetized fermion systems  @xcite .    in the approximation in which the magnetic field is constant and matter is allowed to settle in it , a breaking of the spherical symmetry of the star is apparent .",
    "this is not very relevant for low magnetic fields , but since we want to reach the extreme anisotropic regime , we have chosen to work in cylindrical coordinates in which the polar and equatorial radii differ and the deviation of spherical symmetry is naturally accounted for .",
    "an additional advantage of this procedure is that the construction of an anisotropic energy momentum tensor for the magnetized matter is very well - defined and straightforward .    in  @xcite",
    "we have developed a first attempt to investigate this problem using a general cylindrical symmetric metric , whit coordinates ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we have followed there the procedures of  @xcite to solve einstein equations for an axisymmetric model of a wd to take into account the anisotropy induced by the magnetic field .",
    "a constant magnetic field in ( say ) z - direction defines two main directions in space , parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the main approximation performed in that paper is to assume that all the functions and variables depend only on the radial coordinates @xmath8 and not on @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so that we can solve the dependence on the equatorial direction of the wd .",
    "however , this simple model could be useful to obtain information of the effects of the magnetic field in terms of the shape ( oblateness ) of the wd and yield upper limits for the values of the magnetic field that this objects can sustain .",
    "the present paper builds on the  @xcite results , and applies the same procedure to study the structure equation of a magnetized wd with the aim to confirm or dismiss the recently claims of super - chandrasekhar masses for magnetized wd  @xcite .",

    "we assume that the white dwarfs are predominantly composed by @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 .    the eos including matter and field ( @xmath29 ) contributions have the following form @xmath30     and @xmath31 almost can not be distinguished one of the other . ,",
    "width=453,height=377 ]    in figure  [ fig1 ] we show the eos of the magnetized gas as derived from the above expressions .",
    "it can be noticed that for low values of the magnetic field ( @xmath32 ) , the pressures do not differ much among them and from the non - magnetic case @xmath33 . however , when @xmath34 , the difference of the pressures becomes quite large .",
    "and the vertical lines are solutions of the densities for a constant magnetic field value.,width=453,height=377 ]    to quantify the anisotropy we have defined the splitting coefficient as @xmath35    we will use as a criterion that the border separating the isotropic and the anisotropic regions is just @xmath36 .",
    "we have solved the equation @xmath37 in order to distinguish the anisotropic region from the isotropic one . in figure  [ fig22 ]",
    "we show the plane of matter densities as a function of the magnetic field , the region above the dashed curve falls in the isotropic regime ( @xmath38 ) and the grey region below the curve is in the anisotropic regime ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the vertical lines are the solutions of the densities for a constant magnetic field value , for @xmath40  g , all the points lay in the isotropic region while for @xmath41  g there is a considerable number of points in the anisotropic region .",
    "in our numerical computations we will first use magnetic field values well within the isotropic region @xmath31  g and also in the anisotropic region @xmath42  g to compare the effects on the star structure . in next section it will be shown the impact on the stellar structure of this density - dependent field anisotropy .",
    "in order to set up the problem introduced by the magnetized matter eos in the study of the structure of wds , we will analyze the usual case first , assuming spherical symmetry and solving the resulting tov equations  @xcite . to find the static structure of a relativistic spherical star we have to solve the well - known tov equations .",
    "@xmath43 with the boundary conditions @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the eos @xmath46 .",
    "the mass - radius curves obtained for magnetic fields @xmath47  g ( that is , within the regime in which @xmath48 ) are in agreement with the ones obtained , for example , in  @xcite . therefore , we confirm that quantization of the electronic levels for fields in this regime can not increase the maximum mass of a wd sequence . however , if the magnetic field pressure terms @xmath49 are omitted , higher values can be achieved .",
    "we believe that this unjustified omission is a significative part of the discussion on super- chandrasekhar masses .    when we want to explore the anisotropic region , however , we find that the anisotropy sets in for progressively large regions of the wd when the value of the magnetic field is increased . around @xmath50",
    "g most of the star `` feels '' the anisotropy of the pressures and just the inner regions remain practically isotropic .",
    "this justifies the use of anisotropic solutions for the highest fields .",
    "in order to improve the structure equations in presence of anisotropic pressures we consider in this section an axisymmetric geometry which is more adequate to treat magnetized fermion system .",
    "we follow the same procedure as in  @xcite .",
    "the cylindrically symmetric metric reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are functions of @xmath56 only which as mention before is a main approximation  @xcite .    with the energy momentum tensor for magnetized mater given by  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by the eos ( [ eos1 ] ) , ( [ eos2 ] ) and ( [ eos3 ] ) respectively .    from the einstein field equations in natural units and",
    "using the energy momentum conservation @xmath61 , we obtain the following four differential equations :    [ diff2 ] @xmath62    this , together with the eos @xmath63 is a system of differential equations in the variables @xmath64    we consider @xmath65 which determines the radii of the star , in the equatorial ( perpendicular ) direction .",
    "the solution of the system of equations ( [ diff2 ] ) are shown in figure  [ fig55 ] .",
    "in solar mases , versus perpendicular radius . we have plotted curves for the following magnetic fields values : @xmath66  g ( isotropic case ) , @xmath67  g , @xmath68  g , @xmath69  g @xmath70  g and @xmath42  g. this last value of the magnetic field is the maximum value that we found stable configurations.,width=453,height=377 ]    we have plotted in figure  [ fig55 ] the mass per unit length versus perpendicular radius .",
    "( we can not calculate a `` standard '' mass - radius relation because we did not retain a dependence of our magnitudes on the @xmath9-direction for this choice of the metric ) .",
    "when the magnetic field increases , the perpendicular radius and the mass per unit length of the star also increase .",
    "we have also found that there is a maximum field ( @xmath71  g ) beyond which the metric coefficients exhibit a divergent behavior , this value of the magnetic field coincides with the value when the splitting of the pressures given by the parameter @xmath72 is greater than 1 , for @xmath42  g. this result supports our interpretation that beyond this value of the magnetic field there are no stable solutions of the system , and point towards the end of the theoretical stellar sequences constructed from our assumptions .",
    "we have revisited the role of anisotropic pressures in the description of the structure of a wd .",
    "our findings show that when the splitting coefficient @xmath73 , the differences in the pressures can not be neglected and a different approach must be used to study the structure of the star .",
    "an axisymmetric geometry is more suitable than a spherical one for the solution of einstein equation using a cylindrical symmetric metric .",
    "our choice of the metric in the latter conditions is probably the simplest among all possible cylindrical metrics .",
    "taking into account the pressure anisotropy due to a magnetic field yields a critical field @xmath74  g for magnetized wd , beyond which there are no stable equilibrium configurations .",
    "this bound for the value of the magnetic field is close ( but slightly lower ) to the one obtained based on the scalar virial theorem .",
    "although in our model we can not compute the total mass due to the assumption that all the variables depend only on the perpendicular ( equatorial ) radius and not of the @xmath9-direction  @xcite , the study is useful to confirm the existence of a maximum magnetic field for which the star may undergo an anisotropic collapse due to a magnetic instability .",
    "this point helps to clarify the claim of super- chandrasekhar masses for magnetized wd  @xcite and rules out that the magnetic field could be the reason of the existence of this kind of objects . by the way",
    ", the recent paper  @xcite makes use of extremely high magnetic fields , well above the schwinger value , and clearly beyond the virial estimate ; and also imposes a @xmath75 polytrope as a model for the matter .",
    "this is at odds with previous claims  @xcite by the same authors that a @xmath76 results from landau quantization and hence it is clear that the latter does not stiffen the equation of state needed to achieve the super - chandrasekhar mass values .",
