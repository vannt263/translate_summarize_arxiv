    "the violation of @xmath0 symmetry is well established in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 meson systems  @xcite , and first evidence in the @xmath12 system has been recently reported  @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of @xmath0 violation ( cpv ) in the quark flavour sector performed so far are generally well described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mechanism  @xcite of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , it is believed that the size of cpv in the sm is not sufficient to account for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe @xcite , hence additional sources of @xmath0 symmetry breaking are being searched for as manifestations of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the charm sector is a promising place to probe for the effects of physics beyond the sm .",
    "there has been a renaissance of interest in the past few years since evidence for @xmath1 mixing was first seen  @xcite .",
    "mixing is now well established  @xcite at a level which is consistent with expectations  @xcite .",
    "the recent evidence for cpv in singly cabibbo - suppressed decays of @xmath1 mesons to two - body final states , reported by lhcb  @xcite , has definitely heightened the theoretical interest in charm physics .",
    "prior to this measurement , @xmath0 asymmetries in these decays were expected to be very small in the sm  @xcite , with nave predictions of up to @xmath13 . for this reason ,",
    "the asymmetry measured by lhcb , characterized by a central value of @xmath14 , came as big surprise .    unfortunately , precise theoretical predictions of cpv in this sector are very difficult to achieve , as the charm quark is too heavy for chiral perturbation and too light for heavy - quark effective theory to be applied reliably .",
    "this fact means we can not conclude that the observed effect is a clear sign of physics beyond the sm  @xcite . in order to investigate these promising hints further and clarify the picture , carrying out complementary measurements in other charm decays is of paramount importance .    in the next sections , after a description of the lhcb and cdf measurements with two - body @xmath1 decays , we discuss other recent measurements by the babar , belle , cdf and lhcb collaborations , involving two - body as well as three- and four - body @xmath9 decays .",
    "the time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath15 for @xmath1 decays to a self - conjugate @xmath0 eigenstate @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 ) is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the decay rate for the process indicated . in general",
    "@xmath15 depends on @xmath16 . for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath15 can be expressed in terms of two contributions : a direct component associated with cpv in the decay amplitudes , and an indirect component associated with cpv in the mixing or in the interference between mixing and decay .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath15 may be written to first order as  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the direct @xmath0 asymmetry , @xmath24 is the @xmath1 lifetime , and @xmath25 is the indirect @xmath0 asymmetry , which is universal to a good approximation in the sm  @xcite .",
    "the time - integrated asymmetry measured by an experiment , @xmath26 , depends upon the time - acceptance of that experiment .",
    "it can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the average decay time in the reconstructed sample . denoting by @xmath29 the differences between quantities for @xmath3 and @xmath2 it is then possible to write @xmath30 \\ ,",
    "+ \\ , \\frac { \\delta \\langle t \\rangle}{\\tau } a^{\\mathrm{ind}}_{c\\!p}.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit of vanishing @xmath31 , @xmath32 becomes equal to the difference in the direct @xmath0 asymmetry between the two decays .",
    "however , if the time - acceptance is different for the @xmath33 and @xmath34 final states , a contribution from indirect cpv remains .",
    "the lhcb collaboration performed a measurement of the difference in time - integrated @xmath0 asymmetries between @xmath3 and @xmath2 using 0.62  fb@xmath35 of data  @xcite .",
    "the flavour of the initial state ( @xmath1 or @xmath36 ) is tagged by looking for the charge of the slow pion ( @xmath37 ) in the decay chain @xmath38 .",
    "the raw asymmetry for tagged @xmath1 decays to a final state @xmath16 is given by @xmath39 , defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 refers to the number of reconstructed events of decay @xmath42 after background subtraction .    to first order the raw asymmetries",
    "may be written as a sum of four components , due to physics and detector effects : @xmath43 here , @xmath44 is the asymmetry in efficiency for the @xmath1 decay into the final state @xmath16 , @xmath45 is the asymmetry in efficiency for the slow pion from the @xmath46 decay chain , and @xmath47 is the production asymmetry for @xmath46 mesons .",
    "the first - order expansion is valid since the individual asymmetries are small .",
    "for a two - body decay of a spin-0 particle to a self - conjugate final state there can be no @xmath1 detection asymmetry , i.e. @xmath48 moreover , @xmath45 and @xmath47 are independent of @xmath16 and thus those terms cancel in the difference @xmath49 , resulting in @xmath50 note that the production asymmetry @xmath47 can be neglected in the case of the cdf experiment .",
    "this is because , in contrast with lhcb which is a forward spectrometer and employs flavour - asymmetric @xmath51 collisions , cdf was a symmetric detector in pseudorapidity ( @xmath52 ) and operated at a flavour - symmetric @xmath53 collider .",
    "hence , integrating the measurement over a symmetric @xmath52 range , the possible presence of a production asymmetry is removed by construction , i.e. @xmath54 .    the mass difference ( @xmath55 ) spectra of candidates selected by lhcb as in ref .",

    "the production and detection asymmetries can vary with @xmath64 and pseudorapidity @xmath52 , and so can the detection efficiency of the two different @xmath1 decays , in particular through the effects of the particle identification requirements .",
    "for this reason , since the different masses of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 final states lead to differences in the kinematic distributions of accepted signal events in the two cases , lhcb performs the analysis in several kinematic bins defined by the @xmath64 and @xmath52 of the @xmath46 candidates , the momentum of the slow pion , and the sign of @xmath65 of the slow pion at the @xmath46 vertex .    in each bin",
