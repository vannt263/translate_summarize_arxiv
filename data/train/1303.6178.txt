    "in neutrino oscillation physics , the traditional way of determining the leptonic cp violating phase , @xmath0 , is to measure @xmath0 together with @xmath8 by using @xmath4 and @xmath5 appearance channels in muon neutrino superbeam experiments , ( or similarly by @xmath9 and @xmath10 appearance in either neutrino factory or beta beam experiments ) . in posing the problem in this way",
    ", @xmath3 is assumed to be determined to high accuracy by a @xmath9 disappearance measurement up to the octant degeneracy .",
    "but , now we need a new orientation to choose the right approach for the determination of @xmath0 , because :    * @xmath8 is already determined with high accuracy , and its precision will become even greater by the time @xmath0 is measured @xcite , * and @xmath3 will be determined with less percentage accuracy than @xmath8 in the experimentally preferred region , see @xcite , between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . since the disappearance measurements will have difficulty in determining @xmath13 with an accuracy better than @xmath2 in this region @xcite",
    ".    how seriously does the uncertainty in @xmath14 affect the sensitivity to @xmath0 ?",
    "we show in appendix  [ delta - error ] that the uncertainty of @xmath15 is approximately proportional to @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the @xmath4 and @xmath5 appearance probabilities with uncertainties @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , and @xmath21 is the uncertainty on @xmath14 , and @xmath22 is generically a number of order unity .",
    "thus , when the measurement enters into a precision era in which the percentage uncertainty on @xmath17 and @xmath18 would be smaller than , say 5% , the uncertainty of @xmath15 would be dominated by the @xmath14 uncertainty . in this paper , we present a new strategy for precision measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath3 to overcome this problem .",
    "instead of using @xmath9 disappearance channel for determination of @xmath3 , we rely on @xmath4 and @xmath5 appearance measurement to determine precisely @xmath3 and @xmath0 at the same time . with this method the uncertainties expected for @xmath3 and @xmath0",
    "are related with each other as follows @xmath23 near the first vacuum oscillation maximum , as shown in sec .",
    "[ error-23-delta ] .",
    "therefore , once we enter into the era in which @xmath7 can be measured with reasonably high accuracy , @xmath14 can be determined automatically with significantly higher accuracy than @xmath7 which can be competitive with the disappearance measurement in the region @xmath24 .",
    "of course , the disappearance measurement will provide supplemental information , and also serves as a consistency check on @xmath25sm .",
    "this new setting , of simultaneous measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath0 , brings us to the problem of a new degeneracy involving these two parameters which we call the `` @xmath3 intrinsic degeneracy '' because of it s similarity to the @xmath8 intrinsic degeneracy @xcite . notice that this degeneracy is entirely different from the @xmath3 octant degeneracy discussed in @xcite .",
    "we show that resolving this @xmath3 intrinsic degeneracy is crucial to achieve precision measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath3 , and that the disappearance measurement can not help in region @xmath26 .",
    "we argue that spectrum information around the vacuum oscillation maximum peaks is the most powerful way to resolve the degeneracy .",
    "it may be possible that such spectrum analyses could be carried out with a narrow - band neutrino beam , but if it is not powerful enough , use of a wide - band beam could be required .",
    "if the mass hierarchy is unknown the @xmath3 intrinsic degeneracy would be a part of a larger degeneracy similar to the conventional @xmath27 eightfold parameter degeneracy @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on the `` intrinsic '' part by simply assuming that the mass hierarchy will already be determined at the time when the precision measurement we discuss will be realized .",
    "the generalization to the case including the unknown mass hierarchy can be performed in a straightforward manner .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "it is because the difference between the degenerate solutions of @xmath7 vanishes in vacuum ( see ( [ difference ] ) ) , and only @xmath7 is determined at vom .",

    "understanding the nature of this degeneracy will be elaborated in the following three sections , [ 23-delta - vom ] , [ 23-delta - general ] , and [ features ] .    from the bi - probability plot given in fig .",
    "[ theta23-bi - p ] , one can infer an interesting feature of the @xmath0 dependence of the error of @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath3 , which allows the ellipses moving up and down , results in larger errors for @xmath0 determination at the both ends of the ellipses , i.e. , around @xmath47 , than at @xmath48 , or @xmath49 .",

    "in fact , this feature is seen in some of the figures ( e.g. , in fig .",
    "9 ) given in @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate our new strategy by showing that simultaneous determination of @xmath3 and @xmath0 is the way to proceed . to illuminate the point we consider a counting experiment to measure the @xmath4 and @xmath5 appearance probabilities at a given energy in matter ; @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "we use the matter perturbation theory to obtain a simpler expression which allows intuitive understanding .",

    "therefore , at vom and in near vacuum environment @xmath14 is determined by sum of the probabilities @xmath89 , while @xmath7 is governed by the difference @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 switch their positions to induce sub - leading corrections due to matter effect into @xmath14 and @xmath7 , as shown in ( [ s23-sin - delta ] ) .",
    "let us estimate the expected errors in measurement of @xmath14 and @xmath7 , assuming that the errors for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are independent with each other .",
    "we also assume settings in which the matter effect remains subdominant and use notations @xmath91 for @xmath92 in vacuum .",
    "using ( [ s23 - 0 ] ) and ( [ sin - delta-0 ] ) , the errors , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , are given by @xmath95 notice that the two errors are related with each other at the 1st vom by @xmath96 therefore , once the experiment starts to measure @xmath7 , then @xmath14 can be determined with an uncertainty which is 6 times smaller . thus",
    ", if a precision measurement of @xmath7 is made , then the precision on @xmath14 becomes competitive with the precision from the disappearance measurement , and in fact far exceeds it at around the maximal mixing .",
    "notice that by using the appearance channels we are free from the @xmath3 octant degeneracy inherent in the disappearance channel .",
    "the expression of errors of @xmath14 and @xmath0 in more general setting , off vom and in matter , is given in appendix  [ error - general ] .",
    "if one estimates the @xmath14 error by using the simulation done by the hyper - k collaboration @xcite , assuming 1.5 years of neutrino and 3.5 years of antineutrino runs with beam power of 1.65 mw , one finds find that the precision on @xmath14 exceeds the precision from the disappearance measurement around @xmath97 .",
    "of course , a full stimulation is needed to confirm this result , which is beyond the scope of this paper .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss relative importance between uncertainties of @xmath3 and @xmath8 on @xmath0",

    "as already mentioned , the @xmath3 and the @xmath8 intrinsic degeneracies have many common properties .",
    "for example , in near vacuum environment , both the @xmath8 and the @xmath3 intrinsic degeneracies produce @xmath82 ambiguity , and the merging of the true and clone allowed regions around @xmath98 results in enhanced errors of @xmath0 .",
    "now , one can show , by the similar argument as we have given at the end of sec .",
    "[ intrinsic ] , that the uncertainties of @xmath8 can affect the sensitivity to @xmath0 .",
    "then , the natural question is ; which uncertainties are more important , the one of @xmath8 , or of @xmath3 ?",
    "we argue that one can make a rough estimate of the relative importance of @xmath8 and @xmath3 uncertainties on @xmath0 determination in the following way .",
    "notice that both of the uncertainties produce shift of the ellipses , up and down , along the diagonal line in the bi - probability plot ( see fig .",
    "[ theta23-bi - p ] ) , and this movement results in uncertainty in @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath8 and @xmath3 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , can produce the same amount of shift in the center of ellipse ( the first term in the probabilities in ( [ pemu - matter ] ) ) if they satisfy the relationship @xmath101 where we have used the approximation @xmath102 . using the current data of @xmath8 , @xmath103 @xcite , the uncertainty on @xmath8 is 0.55@xmath104 , thus using eq .",
    "( [ equal - shift ] ) , we can obtain the equivalent shift in @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "this is comparable , or smaller than the current uncertainties on @xmath3 given by @xmath107 at 90% cl @xcite , which implies @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) for upward ( downward ) error at 1@xmath110 cl .",
    "therefore , even in the current situation the uncertainty of @xmath3 can be larger by a factor of @xmath111 than that due to the @xmath8 error . since the error of @xmath8 is expected to become much smaller by the continuing @xmath8 measurements at the time when measurement of @xmath0 is performed , reducing the @xmath3 error is of crucial importance for an accurate measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we present solutions of @xmath14 and @xmath0 for a given set of measurement of @xmath17 and @xmath18 at generic value of @xmath112 . instead of giving the explicit solutions we describe an iterative procedure to obtain the solutions of the degeneracy equations .",
    "the explicit solutions of the degeneracy equations are given in appendix  [ d - solution ] .      to display characteristic properties of the intrinsic @xmath113 degeneracy we derive approximate relationship between the degenerate solutions .",
    "we define differences between two degenerate solutions as @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 . using ( [ pemu - matter ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath117 under the approximation that @xmath118 for the two solution is nearly equal , which is in fact an excellent approximation .",
    "this feature allows us to derive a simple relation for @xmath94 as in ( [ difference ] ) , which is different from the @xmath8 intrinsic degeneracy .    from ( [ difference ] )",
    "one can infer two important characteristic properties of the @xmath113 degeneracy .",

    "* at any vom , ( @xmath120 ) , @xmath21 has to vanish .",
    "it is because the ellipses have zero width at vom and again the two solutions exhibit the @xmath119 degeneracy .",
    "therefore , a measurement near vom can primarily determine only @xmath7 , and in that case @xmath82 degeneracy remains .",
    "spectral information around vom , if available , can be used to break this degeneracy .",

    "it is also remarkable that clone solutions moves significantly upward or downward despite very small variation of neutrino energy of @xmath134 3% .",
    "it implies that resolving power of the @xmath3 intrinsic degeneracy , in principle , can be higher at the 2nd vom .",

    "the accuracy for @xmath14 determination supersedes that of the conventional method which relies on @xmath9 disappearance channels in region @xmath196 , assuming high enough statistics that allows reasonable precision on the measurement of cp phase , @xmath0 .",
    "the reasons for such high accuracy is that the appearance method is free from the problems of jacobian broadening in the translation @xmath197 for values of @xmath3 near @xmath165 , and of the determination of the octant of @xmath3 .    with use of @xmath4 and @xmath5 appearance channels , determination of @xmath3",
    "is inherently coupled with measurement of cp phase @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the uncertainties on the measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath0 are correlated .",
    "furthermore , our treatment reveals that measurement of the two independent parameters metamorphoses into a new strategy which may be called as `` simultaneous measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath0 '' . reflecting on the nature of these measurements , a new parameter degeneracy called the `` @xmath3 intrinsic degeneracy ''",
    "is identified . in general , two degenerate solutions of @xmath3 and @xmath0 are given for each set of measurements of oscillation probabilities , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , producing a new ambiguity and a new source of uncertainties , hitherto unrecognized .",
    "this degeneracy must be resolved to make an accurate determination of both @xmath3 and @xmath0 .    to understand characteristic features of correlated measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath0 ,",
    "we have undertaken the following two approaches : ( 1 ) toward resolution of the degeneracy , we have analyzed the natures of the @xmath3 intrinsic degeneracy , and obtained the analytic formulas for the degeneracy solutions which help us to understand characteristic features of the degeneracy .",
    "( 2 ) we have simulated simple data set of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with suitably assumed errors to obtain the contours of allowed regions in @xmath14 vs. @xmath0 space .",
    "we have examined various settings , hyper - k , lbne , and neutrino factory all around ( or below ) 1st vom , and ess ( european spallation source ) near 2nd vom , using their typical values of baseline and neutrino energies .    from these studies",
    "we have observed the following features of our new method , simultaneous measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "the obtained contours of allowed regions confirm our expectation that the error of @xmath14 determination is approximately six times smaller than that of @xmath7 apart from the problem of merging the degeneracy solutions .",
    "importantly , the movement of clone solutions against varying energy is generally quite large , and the effect is more significant around 2nd vom than the 1st vom .",
    "thus , we have uncovered the crucial point that spectrum information is of key importance to resolve the @xmath3 intrinsic degeneracy .",
    "this feature is reminiscent of the one encountered in the @xmath8 intrinsic degeneracy .",
    "in addition , the contours of allowed regions revealed some characteristic features of the @xmath3 intrinsic degeneracy , such as @xmath198 symmetry , in most of the settings we discussed .",
    "while the feature must hold at vom or in vacuum , its robustness in fact requires explanation .",
    "we have shown that it can be understood by our analytical expressions of the degeneracy solutions , which implies that the matter effect plays only a minor role in the relationship between the two solutions of @xmath0 .",
    "we have concluded that our new method , using @xmath4 appearance channels , offers a better way of measuring @xmath3 with high accuracy , in the region @xmath199 in particular , and the simultaneous measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath0 is the right strategy to carry out precision measurement of the both parameters .",
    "incorporation of these ideas into a full stimulation will be undertaken in a follow up paper @xcite .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the uncertainties in @xmath131 and @xmath7 which would be produced by small measurement uncertainties in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath14 . here , we do _ not _ consider @xmath14 as a parameter determined by our appearance method with @xmath200 measurement , but regard it as an external parameter determined e.g. , by using the disappearance channel .      in vacuum , when @xmath212 , it s clear that uncertainty on @xmath7 does not depend on the uncertainty of @xmath14 whereas the uncertainty on @xmath131 depends strongly on this uncertainty . in matter , however , the uncertainty on both @xmath7 and @xmath131 will depend on the uncertainty on @xmath14 .",
    "one needs both measurements to make a precise measurement of @xmath0 otherwise the measurement will suffer from a degeneracy similar to the @xmath119 degeneracy seen at vom . in the introduction we simplified this",
    "rather complicate situation to make a point regarding the importance of an accurate determination of @xmath14 .    in near vacuum environment , @xmath73 , @xmath213 and we have @xmath214 , which entails the coefficients in @xmath215 in ( [ cos - sin - delta - uncertainty2 ] ) of order unity .",
    "therefore , in near vacuum , an estimation of the uncertainties on @xmath207 ( or @xmath208 ) are given by a very simple expressions @xmath216 where @xmath217 is a coefficient of order unity .",
    "term in the square root in ( [ sin - delta - error - final ] ) but with small coefficient .",
    "for example , @xmath218 for lbne .",
    "] thus , for @xmath219 near @xmath220 , where a precise measurement of @xmath131 is important for an accurate determination of the angle @xmath0 , the uncertainty in @xmath14 plays a significant role .",
    "the feature that @xmath7 does not depend on @xmath14 while @xmath131 does in the near vacuum environment can be easily understood by the bi - probability plot given in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ theta23-bi - p ] .",
    "when @xmath14 is varied within the uncertainty `` center of gravity '' of the ellipse moves along the diagonal line in @xmath221 plane , which affects predominantly @xmath131 but not so much to @xmath7 , as this is a measure of the distance away from the diagonal .",
    "the results in ( [ sin - delta - error - final ] ) and ( [ cos - delta - error - final ] ) are consistent with each other because here @xmath7 and @xmath131 are treated as independent . otherwise , the relationship @xmath222 must hold .",
