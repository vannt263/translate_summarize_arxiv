    "one of the most recent instructive discoveries in string theory , the _ agt conjecture _",
    "@xcite ( see @xcite-@xcite for later progress ) states an equivalence between conformal blocks in two - dimensional conformal field theory ( with @xmath6 symmetry ) on one side @xcite , and the lmns instanton partition functions @xcite in four - dimensional supersymmetric ( @xmath7 ) gauge theory on the other .",
    "this relation is important for several reasons .",
    "basically , it provides a very explicit ( and rigorously formulated ) realization of the string theory idea for a similarity between 4d supersymmetric and 2d conformal field theories , much more concrete than the standard ads / cft duality . serving as a bridge between two different fields of research ,",
    "the agt relation stimulates progress in the both of them ( say , activates the once abandoned studies of conformal blocks of @xmath6-algebras ) .",
    "it also provides @xcite an advanced version @xcite of the well - known correspondence @xcite between 4d effective low - energy actions ( seiberg - witten prepotentials @xcite ) and integrable systems ( often formulated in terms of 2d bosons and fermions ) .",
    "remarkably , apart from the two initial branches of physics connected by the agt relation , there is still another , third field of research , which gets naturally involved : the theory of matrix models @xcite .",
    "this was , of course , expected from the very beginning that matrix models belong to the same level of complexity as seiberg - witten prepotentials , their partition functions are long known to provide solutions to classical integrable hierarchies @xcite , etc ( see @xcite for an exact correspondence between matrix models and seiberg - witten theory ) . nowadays these expectations turned into a very clearly formulated statement : that matrix models provide explicit integral representations for the conformal blocks . to be more precise ,",
    "these are integral representations of conformal blocks @xmath8 in the non - trivially interacting 2d cft in terms of correlators with screening charge insertions in the free field 2d cft _ a - la _ dotsenko and fateev @xcite .",
    "a representative example is the four - point spherical conformal block ( related to @xmath4 nekrasov function with four fundamental matter hypermultiplets ) @xcite : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 + where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the second line is the correlator of normally ordered chiral vertex operators , corresponding to the initial four external fields and additional @xmath14 screening charges , inserted in positions @xmath15 and integrated with peculiar choices of integration contours .",
    "such correlators are free field ( gaussian ) averages , straightforwardly evaluated with help of the wick theorem    @xmath16     + and finally put into the form of multiple integral ( [ fateev - dotsenko ] ) similar to matrix model eigenvalue integrals . for a generic @xmath5 , determined by the value of screening charge @xmath17 and related to the central charge via @xmath18 ,",
    "the integral is not , strictly speaking , an ordinary matrix model , it is rather a generalization known as @xmath0-ensemble @xcite or `` conformal '' matrix model @xcite .",
    "the difference , however , is not too drastic : it is well - known that matrix model theory is easily generalizable from @xmath19 to arbitrary values of @xmath0 , see @xcite for a recent summary .",

    "for all of them , the dotsenko - fateev integrals can be straightforwardly written : extra internal dimensions are described by adding screening operators with different integration contours @xcite ; higher genera surfaces are described by substitution of free field green functions by appropriate theta - functions @xcite ; higher rank symmetries are described by making @xmath27 s and @xmath17 s vector - valued @xcite .",
    "because of this , and also because of their natural simplicity , it is convenient to use the dotsenko - fateev integrals to represent the whole variety of conformal blocks in the left hand ( conformal ) side of the agt conjecture .",
    "this is exactly what we do in the present paper : we use for the conformal blocks the matrix model dotsenko - fateev representation @xcite .    on the other ( gauge theory )",
    "side of the agt conjecture , there are nekrasov functions , the ultimate outcome of evaluation of integrals over the instanton moduli spaces in @xmath28 susy yang - mills theories @xcite",
    ". since integrals over instanton moduli spaces typically diverge , they need to be regularized , and this , as usual , can be done in many different ways .",
    "one of the most popular ways to regularize these integrals @xcite relies on introduction of the so - called @xmath29-background and associated deformation parameters @xmath30 .",
    "the integrals over moduli spaces , regularized in this way , were evaluated in @xcite and finally represented as series in instanton parameters , with all terms explicit .",
    "l230pt        there are many different types of nekrasov functions , classified according to quiver diagrams @xcite , i.e. graphical representations of the field content of a given theory with detailed indication of gauge groups and transformation properties of the matter multiplets . according to the agt conjecture @xcite , each of these types of nekrasov functions corresponds to a conformal block : the conformal diagram can be simply read off from the quiver diagram , with genus corresponding to the number of loops and with the symmetry ( virasoro or , generally , @xmath6 ) fixed by rank of the gauge group ( @xmath4 or , generally , @xmath7 ) .",
    "such a `` dictionary '' between 2d and 4d theories extends the one , originally suggested in @xcite , and represents one of the most explicit manifestations of the gauge - string duality over the last decades .",
    "it is natural that , apart from generalizations and possible applications , more and more attention is getting attracted to the questions of understanding and proof of the agt conjecture .",
    "the _ understanding _ of the otherwise mysterious connection between 2d and 4d theories is generally believed to be based upon existence of a certain unique 6d theory , which is in charge ( through compactification ) of the agt relation . however , due to technical complications this direction remains largely philosophical , and has been unable to produce a _ proof _ yet .    since the agt relation is essentially the equality between the nekrasov functions and dotsenko - fateev integrals , a more concrete approach could be to make use of the well - developed methods of matrix models for the proof .",
    "several suggestions have been proposed on how to deal with the nekrasov functions within the matrix model framework @xcite .    in @xcite in order to proof the agt conjecture in a more concrete way , we suggested to use that the nekrasov functions are @xmath30-deformations of the celebrated seiberg - witten prepotentials , and the corresponding seiberg - witten theory coincides with the seiberg - witten theory of the planar limit of the dotsenko - fateev matrix model @xcite .",
    "then , one may restore the @xmath30-deformations of the both seiberg - witten theories by the topological recursion @xcite , so that they still would coincide , with the seiberg - witten differential in the recursion being given by the exact 1-point resolvent of the matrix model ( or , more precisely , of the @xmath0-ensemble ) .",
    "another possibility is to use the harer - zagier recursion @xcite .",
    "however , at the moment too little is known about matrix model representation of the nekrasov functions , thus , this program remains to be accomplished .",
    "development of the harer - zagier technique may play an important role here .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest to look at nekrasov functions literally : as explicitly known sums over partitions ( young diagrams , see figure 3).such series are indeed available for various    r210pt        nekrasov functions in the literature @xcite . for example , in the case of @xmath4 with four fundamental hypermultiplets ( related to the 4-point spherical conformal block ( [ fateev - dotsenko ] ) ) the nekrasov function can be written as a sum @xmath31 over the young diagrams @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] , with the coefficients @xmath34 being rational functions of the masses @xmath35 , of the coulomb parameter @xmath36 and of the deformation parameters @xmath37 .",

    "this `` sum - over - partitions '' point of view allows one to make a direct contact with matrix models , where these sums appear after _ character expansion _ @xcite : decomposition of the integrand in a proper basis of symmetric polynomials . at @xmath41 , the proper basis",
    "is realized by the ordinary schur polynomials , i.e. by the @xmath42 characters , which are labeled by partitions : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 + etc . , where @xmath46 are the power sums . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the proper deformation of the schur polynomials is the jack polynomials ( aka @xmath0-characters ) , which depend on @xmath47 and on a single additional parameter @xmath0 .",

    ", one needs to express the nekrasov coefficients @xmath34 through the schur polynomials . in this paper",
    ", we describe a solution to this problem for @xmath19 , which corresponds to the case of @xmath3 for the nekrasov function ( the minus in the argument of the schur function corresponds to the transposed young diagram , see ( [ inversion ] ) ) :     decomposes into two different channels @xmath48 and @xmath49 . ]",

    "thus , the agt relation for @xmath19 is derived through the character expansion of the dotsenko - fateev integral , and can be interpreted as duality ( as illustrated in figure 4 ) .",
    "it is tempting to generalize identity ( [ characternekrasov ] ) to @xmath5 , i.e. to @xmath61 .",
    "naively , one just has to substitute the schur polynomials by the jack polynomials",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 + and change the power @xmath0 of the van - der - monde determinant    @xmath65 in the definition of the selberg averages",
    ". however , this naive @xmath0-deformation fails to reproduce the nekrasov coefficients @xmath66 . in our opinion ,",
    "the basic reason for the discrepancy is that @xmath38 ( if considered as a rational function of @xmath36 ) has a very special structure of poles , which accidentally coincides with that of selberg integrals at @xmath19 , but for generic @xmath0 is not captured by the selberg integrals . to reproduce @xmath66 for generic @xmath67 , some _ clever _ deformation of the r.h.s . of ( [ characternekrasov ] )",

    "the aim of this section is to stress that for general @xmath30 the relation between the nekrasov functions and selberg correlators is still missed and is probably more sophisticated .",
    "finding such a relation would be crucial for development in this research direction .",
    "[ [ level-2 . ] ] level 2 .",
    "+ + + + + + + +    at level two , the relation looks like    @xmath154    @xmath155    @xmath156,[1]}(z)r_{[1],[1]}(-z ) + r_{[2],[]}(z)r_{[],[2]}(-z ) + r_{[],[2]}(z)r_{[2],[]}(-z ) + \\emph{}\\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath157,[]}(z)r_{[],[1,1]}(-z ) + r_{[],[1,1]}(z)r_{[1,1],[]}(-z)\\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    again , this is a complicated relation , not quite expectable if one takes a look simply at the rational functions at the l.h.s . and the r.h.s . :",
    "this time , 5 auxiliary poles at @xmath144 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 disappear from the final sum ( as illustrated in figure 11 ) . in analogy with the level 1 case , at @xmath137",
    "the relation gets satisfied term by term and thus completely transparent :     + + - -= @xmath161 + + + + = of course , instead of the combinations of correlators @xmath162 one could also use the combinations @xmath163 or @xmath164 or some linear combination like @xmath165 .",
    "all these formulations are equivalent : each time there is a transcendental equality of sums of rational functions , which at @xmath137 turns into a term - by - term equality .",
    "[ [ higher - levels . ] ] higher levels .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    at higher levels , things get even more sophisticated .",
    "a new feature , which appears at this level of consideration , is that only the correlators @xmath141 remain factorized , while the correlators @xmath142 and @xmath143 at @xmath5 contain non - factorizable expressions in numerators .",
    "thus , it becomes impossible to illustrate the phenomenon by using the shorthand notation @xmath166 .",
    "however , the phenomenon itself does not change : at @xmath137 , the relation between the nekrasov side and the selberg side becomes termwise .",
    "in this paper we succeeded in interpreting the agt relation as the standard duality relation of the hubbard - stratonovich type , see fig.[dual ] : [ hs ] _ a , b(_i x_i^a x_i^b)(_j x_j^a x_j^b ) = _ a , b , i , j x_i^a x_i^b x_j^a x_j^b = _ i , j(_a x_i^a x_j^a)(_b x_i^b x_j^b ) the role of @xmath167 is played by the @xmath42 characters @xmath168 .",
    "this provides a very direct and conceptually clear proof of the agt relation , very different from both the various formal proofs , suggested in @xcite , and more transcendental projects like @xcite etc .",

    "polylinear , rather than bilinear combinations of pair correlators are going to arise .    the technical base of our consideration is the further generalization of the selberg / kadell formulas from single to pair correlators of characters in the selberg and bgw models , given by eqs.([appendixeq1 ] ) and ( [ appendixeq2 ] ) respectively .",
    "we did not describe a proof of these formulas , it is straightforward done within the standard approaches ( e.g. , from the singularity analysis to the ward identities ) .",
    "what deserves to be mentioned , these correlators are _ different _ from another important set of correlators recently considered in @xcite ( see also the end part of the appendix ) .",
    "the two most important differences are : ( i ) ours have poles , while the non - trivial part of those in @xcite have only zeroes ; ( ii ) ours remain non - trivial in the pure gauge limit ( the selberg correlators turn into the bgw ones ) , while the non - trivial part of those in @xcite becomes trivial .",

    "clearly , this difference disappears when @xmath19 , and above eq.([kadell2pt ] ) can be reduced to                   + which is the main identity we use in section 3 .",

    "poles ( white cells with dots ) and zeroes ( grey cells ) of these correlators are shown in figure 13 . note that the poles form a new young diagram , a property not shared by the nekrasov functions , and the same happens for all choices of @xmath56 .",
