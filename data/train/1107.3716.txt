    "the @xmath0 collisions at hera provide a unique opportunity to search for new particles coupling directly to a lepton and a quark .",

    "particle interactions in the sm conserve lepton flavour .",
    "if this property is extended to lq models any such particles produced at hera would decay exclusively into a quark and a first generation lepton , namely an electron or a neutrino .",
    "searches for such signatures have previously been performed at hera  @xcite .",
    "a dedicated analysis investigating the production of second and third generation leptoquarks has also been performed by the h1 collaboration , where the final state contains a muon or the decay products of a tau lepton in combination with a hadronic system  @xcite .    in this paper a search for leptoquarks coupling exclusively to a quark and a first generation lepton is performed using the full @xmath63 collision data set taken in the years 1994 - 2007 by the h1 experiment at hera .",
    "the data were recorded with an electron beam of energy @xmath64  gev , which was longitudinally polarised up to @xmath65% , and a proton beam of energy up to @xmath66  gev , corresponding to a centre - of - mass energy @xmath67 of up to @xmath68  gev .",
    "the total integrated luminosity of the analysed data is @xmath1  pb@xmath2 , which represents a factor of almost four increase with respect to the previously published h1 results .",
    "the presented results supersede those derived in previous searches for first generation leptoquarks by the h1 collaboration  @xcite .",

    "the effective lagrangian considered conserves lepton and baryon number , obeys the symmetries of the sm gauge groups @xmath69 and @xmath70 and includes both scalar and vector lqs . in the framework of the phenomenological buchmller - rckl - wyler ( brw ) model",
    "@xcite , lqs are classified into @xmath71 types  @xcite with respect to the quantum numbers spin @xmath72 , weak isospin @xmath73 and chirality @xmath74 ( left - handed @xmath75 , right - handed @xmath76 ) .",
    "scalar ( @xmath77 ) lqs are denoted as @xmath78 and vector ( @xmath79 ) lqs are denoted @xmath80 in the following .",

    "both the @xmath90 and @xmath91-channel , as well as the interference with sm processes , are important such that both @xmath96 and @xmath97 collisions have similar sensitivity to all lq types .",
    "the search reported here considers final states where the leptoquark decays into an electron and a quark or a neutrino and a quark .",
    "such decays lead to topologies similar to those of deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) interactions at high negative four - momentum transfer squared @xmath98 .",
    "the analysis is therefore performed using event selections ( see section  [ sec : sel ] ) similar to those used in inclusive dis analyses  @xcite and previous lq searches  @xcite .",
