    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is one of the fundamental physical parameters for characterizing galaxies .",
    "having an effective way to derive sfrs for galaxies spanning a large range of look - back times is crucial for our understanding of galaxy evolution leading back to initial conditions .",
    "currently , sfrs have been inferred using continuum or spectral line emission from a wide range of wavelengths ( e.g. calzetti et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ; kennicutt & evans 2012 ) .",
    "however , few of these sfr indicators can be observed over a large redshift range using current facilities . using the capabilities of the esa _ herschel space observatory _ ( hereafter _ herschel _ ; pilbratt et  al .",
    "2010 ) , it is possible to define new sfr indicators in the far infrared ( fir ) window , which can be followed up by the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) over a large redshift range .",
    "the [ nii ]  205 @xmath0 m line , which arises from the @xmath5p@xmath6@xmath7@xmath5p@xmath8 transition ( 205.197 @xmath0 m ; hereafter [ nii](1@xmath70 ) ) of the ground state of the singly ionized nitrogen , is expected to be an excellent indicator of sfr .",
    "this fir line emission essentially traces all of the warm ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the ionization potential of nitrogen ( 14.53 ev ) is only @xmath9 ev larger than that of hydrogen ( 13.6 ev ) , allowing the [ nii ]  luminosity to be used as an estimate of the flux of ionizing photons ( e.g. bennett et al .",
    ". the critical density of [ nii](1@xmath70 )  is only 44  @xmath10 at @xmath11 k ( oberst et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the energy level that emits the line corresponds to only 70 k , so that it can be easily collisionally excited .",
    "in addition , the [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  emission is usually optically thin because of its small einstein coefficient , and suffers much less dust extinction than optical and near infrared lines .",
    "in particular , this line is accessible using alma for a significant fraction of the @xmath12 redshift range ( bands 3 - 10 ) . for more local galaxies , the [ nii](1@xmath70 )  line",
    "can be observed in the two windows around 200  @xmath0 m ( @xmath13 thz and @xmath14 thz ; e.g. paine et al .",
    "2000 ; yang et al .",
    "2010 ) from the very driest sites with future facilities such as the sub - mm / thz telescope at the chinese antarctic observatory under development ( e.g. cui 2010 ) .",
    "early studies have shown that the [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  line is comparatively bright . in most normal star - forming galaxies , it is the third to fifth brightest fir / submm line after [ cii ] 158 @xmath0 m , [ oiii ] 88 @xmath0 m , [ oi ] 63 @xmath0 m and [ nii ] 122 @xmath0 m  lines ( e.g. , wright et al . 1991 ; brauher et al .",
    "the luminosity of [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  line ( @xmath1}$ ] ) may be up to @xmath15 times the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath1}$ ]  is about @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the milky way ( wright et al .",
    "1991 ) and m82 ( petuchowski et al . 1994 ) , respectively .",
    "with such a high luminosity , this line has already been detected with alma for luminous / ultraluminous infrared galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. nagao et al 2012 ; @xmath18 ) .",
    "the [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  line is generally inaccessible to ground - based facilities , and its rest wavelength is longer than the cutoff of the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) .",
    "therefore , this line was observed in only a handful of extragalactic objects using satellite and airborne platforms ( e.g. wright et al .",

    "we present the correlation between @xmath1}$ ]  and @xmath2 , to characterize the [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  line as a sfr indicator .",
    "we also investigate possible dependences of [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  to ir luminosity ratio ( @xmath1}$]/@xmath2 ) on @xmath2 , fir color ( @xmath3 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the _ iras _ 60 @xmath0 m and 100 @xmath0 m fluxes , respectively ) , and the [ oiii ]  88 @xmath0 m to [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  emission ratio ( @xmath21}$]/@xmath1}$ ] ) , to reveal the cause of the scatter in this relation . throughout the paper ,",

    "( pi : n. lu ) , which aims primarily at studying the dense and warm molecular gas properties of 125 lirgs ( @xmath26 , where @xmath2 was calculated by using the _ iras _ four - band fluxes and the equation given in sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) ) , which comprise a flux limited subset of the great observatories all - sky lirgs survey sample ( goals ; armus et al .",
    "the full program details as well as observational data on individual galaxies will be given in a future paper upon the expected completion of the program in early 2013 .",
    "here we present a subsample of 70 galaxies , including 63 lirgs and 7 ulirgs ( @xmath27 @xmath28 ) , all of which are point sources with respect to the _ herschel _ spire / fts beam .",
    "the determination of these galaxies as relative point sources was based both on their observed mid - infrared emission extent ( for example , see daz - santos et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) , and on the consistency between the observed emission strength seen in the overlapping fts bands between 316 and 324 @xmath0 m ( beam sizes are @xmath29 and @xmath30 for ssw and slw , respectively , in this wavelength range ) . a companion letter ( lu et al .",
    "2013 ) gives a brief program description and some initial results on the observed co line emission .",
    "the observations were conducted with the spire fts in staring and high spectral resolution mode between 194672 @xmath0 m , yielding a resolution of 0.04 cm@xmath23 ( = 1.2 ghz ) .",
    "the data were reduced using a customized version of the standard spire reduction and calibration pipeline for point source mode included in hipe version 7.3 ( ott 2010 ) .",
    "we used an averaged telescope relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) in place of the daily rsrf , to perform the flux calibration . during the reduction",
    ", we did not apply any apodization to the spectra . to extract the final spectrum , a  background \" emission , which was obtained by fitting the median spectrum from the spatially surrounding detectors ,",
    "was subtracted from the central detector .     205 @xmath0 m  line for galaxies with a range of @xmath3 colors ( going redder from top to bottom ) .",
    "in each panel , the blue , red and black lines show the observed spectrum , the fitted profile of the [ nii ]  line plus continuum , and the residual , respectively . in the left panels , the [ nii ]  line",
    "is fitted using a _ sinc _ function with a free width parameter .",
    "the right panels show the same data but the line is fitted using a fixed instrumental _",
    "function convolved with a free width gaussian shape ( scg ) .",
    "it is clear that the scg function can give a better fitting result for this line . ]    in most cases the [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  line is the brightest line in the spire fts wavelength range , and almost all sources show high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the [ nii ]  line . in fig .",
    "1 we plot several typical spectra of the [ nii ]  line for galaxies with a range of fir colors ( @xmath32 ) , and superimpose a fitted continuum and the line profile . from the figure , one can see that the fixed _ sinc _",
    "function convolved with a free width gaussian ( scg ) profile gives a better fitting result for the [ nii ]  line since the instrumental resolution of the spire fts in high resolution mode at @xmath33 @xmath0 m is only about 300 km s@xmath23 and the line width has an influence on the line shape .",
    "therefore , we adopted the scg profiles for the integrated [ nii ]  line flux measurements except for one galaxy ( cgcg448 - 020 ) where a single _ sinc _ profile was better due to its narrow line width ( @xmath34 km s@xmath23 for low j co lines ; e.g. baan et al . 2008 ; leech et al . 2010 ) and relatively low s / n ( @xmath35 ) in the line .",
    "the resulting full width at half maximum of the [ nii ]  line ( excluding cgcg448 - 020 ) is @xmath36 km s@xmath23 , with a median value of @xmath37 km s@xmath23 .",
    "in most cases , the @xmath38 statistical uncertainties in the integrated line flux are less than 10% , and the median value is 7% .",

    "( 2008 ) , in our analysis . for these objects ,",
    "most of which are normal star - forming galaxies , the luminosity distances were derived with the same method as used for our ( u)lirg sample ( e.g. armus et al . 2009 ) , i.e. by correcting the heliocentric velocity for the 3-attractor flow model of mould et al .",
    "their [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  fluxes are derived from the observed [ nii ] 122 @xmath0 m  fluxes given in brauher et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , using the theoretical [ nii ] 122 @xmath0 m  to [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  emission ratio ( hereafter @xmath39 ) at @xmath40 @xmath10 ( the median value for late type galaxies ; see e.g. ho et al .",
    "1997 ) of @xmath39=2.6 . here",
    "we compute the theoretical @xmath39 by assuming electron impact excitation for the ground - state levels of n@xmath41 , and using the fitted results ( draine 2011 ) of hudson & bell ( 2005 ) with @xmath11 k to calculate the collision strengths ( more details are provided in zhao et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ) . regarding the inclusion of brauher et al .",
    "galaxies in our study , we note that ( 1 ) about 90% of the galaxies in ho et al .",

    "therefore , the uncertainty in @xmath1}$ ]  caused by extrapolating [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  fluxes from [ nii ] 122 @xmath0 m  emissions is a factor of a few ( @xmath46 dex ) , and is significantly smaller than the two order - of - magnitude span of @xmath2  found in our sample , thus yielding useful results concerning the @xmath1}$]-@xmath2  relation .    in fig .",

    "the solid symbols indicate agns / liners .",
    "generally , @xmath1}$ ]  increases with @xmath2 , albeit the scatter seems to increase with @xmath2  ( we will return to this later ) . in fact , the scatter at the high @xmath2  end will be much reduced if we only look at the non - active galaxies . a nonweighted least - squares linear fit , using a geometrical mean functional relationship ( isobe et al . 1990 ) , to the non - active galaxies , gives @xmath47}\\ ] ] with a scatter of 0.26 dex in @xmath2 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath48 of the trend is 0.78 at a @xmath49 level of significance , which indicates a very strong correlation between @xmath1}$ ]  and @xmath2 .",
    "our fit shows that , on average , @xmath2  scales with @xmath50}}^\\alpha$ ] with @xmath51 between 0.8 and 1.1 at the @xmath52 significance .",
    "this nearly linear relation suggests that the power source of the [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  emission tightly relates to the star - forming activities . using the sfr-@xmath2  calibration given in kennicutt & evans ( 2012 ) ,",

    "1994 ) , and inter - comparable since the techniques for obtaining @xmath2  for low and high redshift objects are so instrument - dependent .",
    "the majority of massive galaxies up to @xmath54 are already chemically evolved systems based on their co and dust emissions ( solomon & vanden bout 2005 ) or optical / ir line spectroscopy ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , eq . ( 2 ) can be reasonably applicable to high-@xmath55 starburst galaxies despite that the @xmath1}$]-@xmath2  relation possibly depends on metallicity .          in fig .",
    "2 we can also see an indication of a steeper relation between @xmath1}$ ]  and @xmath2  for @xmath56 galaxies .",
    "this is more clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "3_a _ , in which we plot @xmath1}$]/@xmath2  vs @xmath2  for the same set of galaxies . for ulirgs ,",
    "the mean @xmath1}$]/@xmath2  ( @xmath57 dex ) is considerably lower than that ( @xmath58 dex ) of the galaxies with lower ir luminosities . due to the small ulirg sample size and the prevalence of agn",
    "we can reach no firm conclusion as to whether the @xmath1}$]/@xmath2  decreases with @xmath2@xmath59 for starburst - dominated galaxies .",
    "however , the scatter in the @xmath2-@xmath1}$ ]  relation is as large as @xmath46 dex , and seems to increase with @xmath2 , specially when ulirgs are taken into account .",
    "the scatter could have several different origins : metallicity variations and most likely , differing ionizing conditions .",
    "these latter effects include : the stellar uv input via the initial mass function , the aging of starbursts , the hii  region / ism geometry or the presence of an agn .",
    "our sample of galaxies contains few low metallicity objects , and therefore we only address ionization effects here .",
    "we note that the ionization parameter ( @xmath60 ) can be especially high in ( u)lirgs ( e.g. farrah et al .",
    "2007 , petric et al . 2011 ) , where @xmath60 is defined as the dimensionless ratio of the number density of incident ionizing photons to the number density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "clearly , @xmath60 can be measured through ionization parameter - sensitive line ratios , such as [ oiii]/[oii ] and [ niii]/[nii ] . moreover , theoretical models have also shown that @xmath60 can be roughly indicated by the ir color , @xmath3 , by the means that @xmath61 increases with @xmath3 ( see e.g. abel et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in fig .",
    "3_b _ we plot the dependence of @xmath1}$]/@xmath2  on @xmath3 .",
    "we can see from the figure that there only exists a very weak dependence of @xmath1}$]/@xmath2  on @xmath3 when @xmath62 .",
    "however , @xmath1}$]/@xmath2  clearly decreases as @xmath3 increases when @xmath63 , except for a few galaxies with the warmest fir colors in the sample .",
    "moreover , the scatter in this correlation is less than that in the @xmath1}$]/@xmath2  vs. @xmath2  plot ( see fig .",
    "3_a _ ) and depends little on @xmath3 .",
    "but we note that the scatter in the @xmath1}$]/@xmath2-@xmath3 plot is still large , and we hypothesize that it is caused by the variations in the radiation field , since n@xmath41 needs high energy ( 29.6 ev ) to form n@xmath64 , and the population of ionic",
    "n is determined mainly by the slope of the background uv spectrum , i.e. the hardness , at a given @xmath60 .    to try to account for the effects of the hardness of ionizing radiation field on @xmath1}$]/@xmath2",
    ", we use the ratio of the [ oiii ]  88 @xmath0 m emission , rather than [ niii ]  57 @xmath0 m emission where there are few detections , to the [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  emission to trace the hardness of the ionizing photons .",
    "it takes 35 ev to form o@xmath64 , which is only @xmath65 ev higher than that needed for the formation of n@xmath64 , and thus the [ oiii]/[nii ]  line ratios are even stronger indicator of the hardness .",
    "furthermore , this ratio is insensitive to the gas density ( rubin 1984 ) . except for m82 ( duffy et al .",
    "1987 ) and mrk 231 ( fischer et al .",
    "2010 ) , all of the [ oiii ]  88 @xmath0 m fluxes are adopted from brauher et al .",

    "( hereafter [ oiii ]  sample ) are also marked with red circles in figs .",
    "3_a _ and 3_b _ , which indicates that the hardness variation of the heating radiation field among galaxies can largely account for the scatter shown in the @xmath2-@xmath1}$ ]  relation , at least for @xmath68 @xmath28 galaxies .",
    "actually , this is also supported by the fact that the scatter of less luminous galaxies ( 0.2 dex for brauher et al . sample ; thus probably less active in star formation and lower @xmath60 ) is smaller than that of our luminous sample ( 0.28 dex ) .",
    "keeping in mind that the conversion from [ nii ] 122 @xmath0 m  flux to [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  flux may contribute largely to the scatter of brauher et al .",
    "sample , the real scatter in the @xmath1}$]-@xmath2  relation might probably be even smaller for these galaxies .    to obtain a direct view of how much the scatter can be reduced , we also display the hardness - corrected @xmath1}$]/@xmath2 , which was calculated according to the fitted @xmath21}$]/@xmath1}$]-@xmath1}$]/@xmath2  relation , for the [ oiii ]  sample in fig .",

    "comparing to fig .",
    "3_a _ , one can see that the scatter is reduced significantly ( from 0.26 dex to 0.11 dex by excluding mrk 231 , which is still an outlier due to that the hardness correction has little effect on it , and is outside the plotted range ) .",

    "<S> we present , for the first time , a statistical study of [ nii ] 205 @xmath0 m  line emission for a large sample of local luminous infrared galaxies using _ herschel _ spectral and photometric imaging receiver fourier transform spectrometer ( spire fts ) data . for our sample of galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the correlation between the [ nii ]  luminosity ( @xmath1}$ ] ) and the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath2 ) , as well as the dependence of @xmath1}$]/@xmath2  ratio on @xmath2 , far infrared colors ( _ iras _ @xmath3 ) and the [ oiii ]  88 @xmath0 m to [ nii ]  luminosity ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath1}$ ]  correlates almost linearly with @xmath2  for non agn galaxies ( all having @xmath4 ) in our sample , which implies that @xmath1}$ ]  can serve as a sfr tracer which is particularly useful for high redshift galaxies which will be observed with forthcoming submm spectroscopic facilities such as the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the deviation from the mean @xmath1}$]-@xmath2  relation correlates with tracers of the ionization parameter , which suggests the scatter in this relation is mainly due to the variations in the hardness , and/or ionization parameter , of the ambient galactic uv field among the sources in our sample . </S>"
