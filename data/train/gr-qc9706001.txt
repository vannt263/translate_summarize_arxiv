    "one major direction of research on quantum field theory in curved spacetime @xcite since the 1980s has been the application of interacting quantum fields to the consideration of symmetry breaking and phase transitions in the early universe , from the planck to the grand unified energy scales @xcite . in a series of work , hu ,",
    "oconnor , shen , sinha , and stylianopoulos @xcite systematically investigated the effect of spacetime curvature , dynamics , and finite temperature in causing a symmetry restoration of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime .",
    "in general one wants to see how quantum fluctuations @xmath2 around a mean field @xmath3 change as a function of these parameters . for this purpose ,",
    "the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action was constructed for an @xmath4-component scalar o@xmath0 model with quartic interaction @xcite .",
    "hu and oconnor @xcite found that the spectrum of the small - fluctuation operator contains interesting information concerning how infrared behavior of the system depends on the geometry and topology .",
    "the equation for @xmath3 containing contributions from the variance of the fluctuation field @xmath5 depicts how the mean field evolves in time .",
    "this program explored two of the three essential elements of an investigation of a phase transition @xcite , the geometry and topology and the field theory and infrared behavior aspects , but not the nonequilibrium statistical - mechanical aspect .",
    "for this and other reasons , calzetta and hu @xcite started exploring the closed - time - path ( ctp ) or schwinger - keldysh formalism @xcite , which is formulated with an `` in - in '' boundary condition .",
    "because the ctp effective action produces a real and causal equation of motion @xcite , it is well suited for particle production back - reaction problems @xcite .",
    "use of the ctp formalism in conjunction with the 2pi effective action @xcite and the wigner function @xcite enabled calzetta and hu to construct a quantum kinetic field theory ( in flat spacetime ) , deriving the boltzmann field equation from first principles @xcite .",
    "the necessary ingredients were then in place for an analysis of nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "in recent years these tools ( ctp , 2pi ) have indeed been applied to the problems of heavy - ion collisions , pair production in strong electric fields @xcite , disoriented chiral condensates @xcite , and reheating in inflationary cosmology @xcite . however",
    ", none of these recent works has included curved spacetime effects in a self - consistent manner , where the spacetime governs the evolution of a quantum field and is , in turn , governed by the quantum field dynamics .",
    "this is especially important for planck scale processes involving quantum fluctuations with back reaction , such as particle creation @xcite , galaxy formation @xcite , preheating , and thermalization in chaotic inflation @xcite .",
    "with this paper we return to the problems begun by calzetta , hu and oconnor a decade ago .",
    "we wish to derive the coupled equations for the evolution of the mean field and the variance for the o@xmath0 model in curved spacetime , which should provide a solid and versatile platform for studies of phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "the first order of business is to construct the ctp-2pi effective action in a general curved spacetime .",
    "the evolution equations are derived from it .",
    "we must also deal with the divergences arising in it . from the vantage point of the correlation hierarchy ( and the associated master",
    "effective action ) as applied to a nonequilibrium quantum field @xcite , there is _ a priori _ no reason why one should stop at the 2pi effective action .",
    "indeed , the 2pi effective action corresponds to a further approximation from the two - loop truncation of the master effective action constructed from the full schwinger - dyson hierarchy @xcite . for problems where the mean field and the two - point function give an adequate description ( which is not the case near the critical point , where one has to be careful ) , the ctp-2pi effective action is sufficient . in particular",
    ", the 2pi effective action contains the commonly used large-@xmath4 , time - dependent hartree - fock , and one - loop approximations .",
    "the o@xmath0 model has been usefully applied to a great variety of problems in field theory and statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the o@xmath0 field theory has the advantage that it affords use of the @xmath6 expansion @xcite , which yields nonperturbative evolution equations in the regime of strong mean field ( it yields local , coupled dynamical equations for the mean field and the mode functions of the fluctuation field ) .",
    "recently it has been applied to problems of nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite . in the preheating problem",
    "studied in the following paper @xcite , we shall see that this is particularly important for chaotic inflation scenarios @xcite , in which the inflaton mean - field amplitude can be on the order of the planck mass at the end of the slow roll period @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 expansion has many attractive features , as it is known to preserve the ward identities of the o@xmath0 model @xcite and to yield a covariantly conserved energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of large @xmath4 , the quantum effective action for the matter fields can be interpreted as a leading - order term in the expansion of the full ( matter plus gravity ) quantum effective action @xcite .",
    "mazzitelli and paz @xcite have studied the @xmath1 and o@xmath0 field theories in a general curved spacetime in the gaussian and large-@xmath4 approximations , respectively .",
    "their approach differs from ours in that it is based on a gaussian factorization which does not permit systematic improvement either in the loop expansion or in the @xmath6 approximation .",
    "in contrast , our approach is based on a closed - time - path formulation of the correlation dynamics , and the evolution equation we obtain for the two - point function contains a two - loop radiative damping contribution which is not present in the large-@xmath4 approximation . at leading order in the large-@xmath4 approximation , our results agree with theirs , so that their renormalization counterterms can be directly applied to the mean field and gap equations derived here .",
