    "graphene exhibits electronic properties that conventional metals do not show , e.g. , charge carriers with zero effective mass , anomalous quantum hall effect , and a minimum conductivity when carrier concentrations tend to zero  @xcite .",
    "the unconventional electronic properties of graphene occur due to its linear energy dispersion in the vicinity of the dirac point and two - dimensional structure  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies show , however , that a linear energy dispersion relation is not unique to graphene  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a flat two - dimensional silicon ( si ) sheet with a honeycomb lattice  ( silicene ) exhibits a linear energy dispersion too  @xcite .",
    "even buckling of the si honeycomb lattice  ( si tends to form @xmath1 bonds rather than @xmath2 bonds ) does not remove the linearity in the energy dispersion relation nor does it open an energy gap  @xcite .",
    "more generally , it has been predicted that a group - iv nanosheet with a flat or buckled honeycomb lattice also shows a linear dispersion too  @xcite .",
    "it is the underlying symmetries of the honeycomb lattice that are responsible for the linear energy dispersion  @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional carbon nanostructures also exhibit unconventional electronic properties , e.g. , carbon nanotubes show different electronic behavior depending on their chirality . similarly to graphene , the unconventional electronic properties are not unique to carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",

    "hydrogenation of silicene can also open a gap ( e.g. , hydrogenated graphene  ( graphane ) is an insulator of direct band gap  @xcite ) and the resulting compound should be related to polysilane  @xcite .",

    "for the hydrogenated si sheet , we find that ( @xmath4 ) it is an semiconductor of indirect band gap of about @xmath0ev ; ( @xmath5 ) the lowest point of the conduction bands  ( cb ) occurs at the m point and the highest point of the valence bands  ( vb ) occurs at the @xmath8 point ; ( @xmath6 ) the indirect gap is closely related to the band structure of silicene and it is mainly due to band - filling effect ; ( @xmath7 ) the degeneracy at the dirac point is not lifted by hydrogenating the si sheet .",
