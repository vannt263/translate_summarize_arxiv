    "there is a long tradition in studying connections between borel structure of polish spaces ( descriptive set theory ) and model theory .",
    "the connection arises from the fact that any class of countable structures can be coded into a subset of the space @xmath0 provided all structures in the class have domain  @xmath1 .",
    "a survey on this topic is given in @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath2 and @xmath3 are subsets of @xmath0 and let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be equivalence relations on @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . if @xmath6 is a map such that @xmath7 , we say that @xmath8 is a _ reduction of @xmath4 to @xmath5_. if there exists a borel or continuous reduction , we say that @xmath4 is borel or continuously _",
    "reducible _ to @xmath5 , denoted @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the mathematical meaning of this is that @xmath8 _ classifies @xmath4-equivalence in terms of @xmath5-equivalence_. the benefit of various reducibility and irreducibility theorems is roughly the following . a reducibility result ,",
    "say @xmath9 , tells us that @xmath4 is at most as complicated as @xmath5 ; once you understand @xmath5 , you understand @xmath4 ( modulo the reduction ) .",
    "an irreducibility result , @xmath11 tells that there is no hope in trying to classify @xmath4 in terms of @xmath5 , at least in a `` borel way '' . from the model theoretic point of view , the isomorphism relation , and the elementary equivalence relation ( in some language ) on some class of structures",
    "are the equivalence relations of main interest .",
    "but model theory in general does not restrict itself to countable structures .",
    "most of stability theory and shelah s classification theory characterizes first - order theories in terms of their uncountable models .",
    "this leads to the generalization adopted in this paper .",
    "we consider the space @xmath12 for an uncountable cardinal @xmath13 with the idea that models of size @xmath13 are coded into elements of that space .",
    "this approach , to connect such uncountable descriptive set theory with model theory , began in the early 1990 s .",
    "one of the pioneering papers was by mekler and vnnen @xcite .",
    "a survey on the research done in 1990 s can be found in @xcite and a discussion of the motivational background for this work in @xcite .",
    "a more recent account is given the book @xcite , chapter  9.6 .",
    "let us explain how our approach differs from the earlier ones and why it is useful . for a first - order complete countable theory in a countable vocabulary @xmath14 and a cardinal @xmath15 , define @xmath16 where @xmath17 is some fixed coding of ( all ) structures of size @xmath13 .",
    "we can now define the partial order on the set of all theories as above by @xmath18 as pointed out above , @xmath19 says that @xmath20 is at most as difficult to classify as @xmath21 . but does this tell us whether @xmath14 is a simpler theory than @xmath22 ?",
    "rough answer : _ if @xmath23 , then no but if @xmath24 , then yes_.    to illustrate this , let @xmath25 be the theory of the order of the rational numbers ( dlo ) and let @xmath22 be the theory of a vector space over the field of rational numbers . without loss of generality we may assume that they are models of the same vocabulary .",
    "it is easy to argue that the model class defined by @xmath22 is strictly simpler than that of @xmath14 .",
    "( for instance there are many questions about @xmath14 , unlike @xmath22 , that can not be answered in zfc ; say existence of a saturated model . ) on the other hand @xmath26 and @xmath27 because there is only one countable model of @xmath14 and there are infinitely many countable models of @xmath22 .",
    "but for @xmath24 we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 , since there are @xmath12 equivalence classes of @xmath30 and only one equivalence class of @xmath20 .",
    "another example , introduced in martin koerwien s ph.d .",
    "thesis and his article @xcite shows that there exists an @xmath1-stable theory without dop and without otop with depth 2 for which @xmath31 is not borel , while we show here that for @xmath32 , @xmath33 is borel for all classifiable shallow theories .",
    "the results suggest that the order @xmath34 for @xmath24 corresponds naturally to the classification of theories in stability theory : the more complex a theory is from the viewpoint of stability theory , the higher it seems to sit in the ordering @xmath34 and vice versa .",
    "since dealing with uncountable cardinals often implies the need for various cardinality or set theoretic assumptions beyond zfc , the results are not always as simple as in the case @xmath23 , but they tell us a lot .",
    "for example , our results easily imply the following ( modulo some mild cardinality assumptions on @xmath13 ) :    if @xmath14 is deep and @xmath22 is shallow , then @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath14 is unstable and @xmath22 is classifiable , then @xmath35 .",
