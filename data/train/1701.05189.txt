    "* figure [ fig : mmcavedge ] shows that a smooth drop in the big - dust distribution shifts the peak in the mm continuum emission toward smaller radius , and the model does not match the data at large baselines .",
    "thus a smooth cavity edge in big dust appears inconsistent with the data . * in gas observations , @xcite successfully fitted the alma cycle 0 @xmath0co @xmath12 3 - 2 observations with a sharp gas cavity edge at 30 au ; however , this model can not fit the new alma co data .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mmcavedge ] , a sharp drop - off at @xmath94 au gives model visibility profiles of the other co isotope lines that have clear deviations around the location of the null ( although the total integrated flux is similar and the @xmath0co 2 - 1 visibility profile fits reasonably well ) . also , a double - drop model ( two sharp @xmath95 drops , one at @xmath76 , the other at @xmath75 ) , such as proposed by @xcite , is not able to reproduce the visibility profiles of the co isotope lines .",
    "we conclude that the current data in scattered light can not distinguish a sharp cavity edge from a smooth transition that takes places over 10 au in the vicinity of the cavity edge , whereas the mm continuum data appear to require a relatively sharp cavity edge .",
    "the cavity edge structures in big and small dust can be approximately co - spatial . by comparison , the co line data demand a smooth transition in gas density between 15 and 70 au .",
    "models with smooth gas cavity edges as in the fiducial model were also fitted successfully to previous co isotopologue data of other transitional disks at lower spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we report on alma cycle 2 observations of the transitional disk j160421.7 - 213028 ( j1640 ) in 230 ghz continuum and @xmath0co , @xmath1co , and c@xmath2o @xmath1221 emission . using radiative transfer simulations , we construct a simple disk+cavity model to account for the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and for resolved observations of the system in near - infrared ( nir ) scattered light , dust continuum emission , and co line emission .",
    "we constrain the radius of the cavity , its depth , and the sharpness of its edge .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "our fiducial model , which fits the observations adequately by eye , has a completely empty cavity in both sub-@xmath21-sized small dust and mm - sized big dust , of radius of 6070 au .",
    "the gas exhibits a cavity 15 au in radius that is uniformly depleted by a factor of @xmath96 ; the gas surface density grades smoothly from the edge of this gas cavity to the outer ( undepleted ) disk at 70 au .",
    "2 .   the nir scattered light observations constrain the cavity radius in small dust to within @xmath975 au from the best - fit value of 60 au .",
    "the first null on the visibility curves of the dust continuum and c@xmath2o emission constrain the cavity size in the big dust and in the gas to within @xmath9710 au of 70 au and 15 au , respectively .",
    "thus the data are consistent with the same cavity size in the two dust populations , while both dust cavities are significantly larger than the gas cavity .",
    "3 .   while the scattered light and mm continuum data are consistent with a completely empty cavity in both small and big dust , the data can tolerate a finite factor of @xmath98 depletion in both .",
    "the co line data require gas surface densities at 15 au to be depleted by factors of @xmath99@xmath100 relative to gas surface densities at 70 au .",
    "4 .   currently , the nir data can not distinguish between a sharp cavity edge in the small dust population and a transition region of annular width 10 au .",
    "the co observations demand that gas densities vary smoothly inside 70 au ; a sharp gas cavity edge at 30 au , or a model that drops in gas surface density at both 15 au and 70 au , can not fit the data .",
    "_ what is the nature of j1604 s cavity ?",
    "_ j1604 bears a number of characteristics common to other transitional disks .",
    "it shows clear signs of a depleted inner region in all disk components , with a gas cavity that is substantially smaller than the dust cavity .",
    "similar structures have been seen in a few transitional disks @xcite , and are interpreted as evidence of dynamical clearing by ( multiple ) planets inside the cavities , coupled with dust filtration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the other hand",
    ", j1604 is unique among its peers in several ways .",
    "while all the other sources in the van der marel alma co disk sample have accretion rates on the order of 10@xmath101 yr@xmath17 , j1604 has little accretion , no larger than @xmath102 yr@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its innermost dust disk of radius @xmath103  au may be time variable , with irac data indicating no nir excess and the wise photometry and spitzer irs spectrum indicating a small nir excess ( table  [ tab : sed ] ) .",
    "in addition , while many transitional disks appear to be asymmetric in the alma dust continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , j1604 has a nearly symmetric ring in thermal emission . at the same time , scattered light imaging shows that the ring has a small gap of time - varying position angle along its circumference @xcite  see figure [ fig : nir_fiducial ] .    as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , both dynamical sculpting by planets and photoevaporation can open cavities in disks .",
    "the main observational distinction between the two is whether the system still has significant accretion onto the central star .",
    "transitional disks with significant accretion ( on the order of @xmath104 yr@xmath17 ) may be compatible with planets , while those with negligible accretion may indicate starvation by photoevaporation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed small - to - zero accretion rate in j1604 suggests the latter .",
    "however , the smooth gas gap edge transition in j1604 appears inconsistent with photoevaporation ( section  [ sec : intro ] ; e.g. , @xcite ) , even as the small dust grains  which are expected to be well coupled to the gas  do exhibit a relatively sharp drop in density at the cavity edge .",
    "the difference between the small dust and gas edge structures is intriguing and merits future study .",
    "finally , we note that if planets are responsible for opening the cavity , the size and depth of the cavity imply a chain of multiple massive planets , likely of multi - jupiter masses , unless the disk viscosity @xmath105 is substantially lower than @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "such planets at large radius have been found to be rare @xcite .",
    "there are at least two paths forward for exploring the origin of the cavity in j1604 .",
    "first , if the cavity is opened by ( multiple ) giant planets , these may be detected in deep direct imaging observations .",
    "so far the deepest exposure for j1604 is by @xcite , in which no planet candidates were found , and objects of mass 23 @xmath61 outside 25 au have been ruled out according to the hot - start planet formation model .",
    "second , if the disk is currently being photoevaporated , blueshifted optical and infrared forbidden lines indicating a photoevaporative wind may be detectable in this nearly face - on system ( see the example in tw hya , @xcite ) .",
    "further observations are needed to elucidate the nature of j1604 s cavities .",
