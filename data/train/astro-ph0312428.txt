    "pre  main - sequence stars are well known for their photometric variability , both erratic and periodic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the photometric behavior of kh  15d is unusual even by the standards of pre  main - sequence stars .",
    "the star is a 210 myr - old t  tauri star of spectral type k7 , located in the open cluster ngc  2264 @xcite . as discovered by @xcite , the star s brightness decreases by 3.5 magnitudes every 48.35 days , and these deep brightness excursions currently last more than 20 days .",
    "the extreme depth and long duration of the eclipses rule out occultation by a companion star , or modulation by star spots , as possible explanations .",
    "the strict periodicity seems incompatible with a mechanism based on unstable accretion . during brightness",
    "minima the fractional polarization rises , suggesting that the entire face of the star is occulted by circumstellar material and that only scattered light is received at those times @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that continued observations will reveal the geometry and structure of the material and provide unique information about circumstellar processes , or even planet - forming processes .",
    "the brightness variations are not accompanied by significant color variations @xcite , implicating large particles or macroscopic bodies as the occultors .",
    "the ingress and egress light curves can be understood qualitatively as the result of a sharp occulting edge moving across the face of the star with a velocity vector nearly parallel to the edge .",
    "a peculiar phenomenon observed at mid - eclipse is the `` central re - brightening '' : a phase lasting a few days during which the star re - brightens . in the past",
    ", the central re - brightening returned the system brightness to the out - of - eclipse level .",
    "in one early observation , the star _ exceeded _",
    "its uneclipsed brightness by 0.5  magnitude @xcite .",
    "ongoing photometric monitoring by @xcite and @xcite has shown that the light curve of kh  15d evolves with time .",
    "the duration of the eclipses has been growing steadily since 1996 , at a rate of @xmath11  day  year@xmath2 .",
    "the central re - brightenings have been declining in strength , and are now much less pronounced than they used to be . given these secular changes , it should be illuminating to assemble a historical light curve of kh  15d from archival photographic observations of ngc  2264 .",
    "fortunately , it is realistic to expect that suitable archival observations exist .",
    "the star is presently bright enough ( @xmath3 ) to have been detected on photographic plates with modest - sized telescopes .",
    "it resides in a young and relatively unobscured cluster full of variable stars that has attracted scientific interest for many decades .",
    "winn , garnavich , stanek , & sasselov ( 2003 ) performed the first archival study of kh  15d , using plates from the collection of the harvard college observatory .",
    "although the star was too faint and too blended with a nearby bright star for accurate photometry , @xcite established that between 1913 and 1955 , the star was rarely ( if ever ) fainter by more than one magnitude than its present uneclipsed state .",
    "they expressed this result as an upper limit of 20% on the duty cycle of 1  mag eclipses .",
    "this showed that the deep eclipses are a recent phenomenon , and motivated the search for more photographs taken after 1950 in order to identify the onset of the eclipses .",
    "we have been gathering additional plates from observatories around the world in order to fill in the photometric history of kh  15d .",
    "this paper presents new results from our archival exploration , based on a time series of high - quality photographic plates from the asiago observatory , taken between 1967 and 1982 . in   [ data ] , we describe the plates and the digitization process .",
    "we determined the magnitude of kh  15d on each plate with the procedure described in   [ photometry ] .",
    "the asiago light curve is presented in   [ results ] and compared to the modern light curve .",
    "we conclude in   [ discussion ] by summarizing the results and speculating on the reason for the striking evolution of the system between 1967 and today .",
    "the astrophysical observatory of asiago , in northern italy , houses a collection of nearly 80,000 photographic plates @xcite . among them",
    "are more than 300 images of ngc  2264 , but most of the exposures were too shallow to expect kh  15d to be detectable . in some other cases , the exposure is sufficiently deep , but the position of kh  15d is excessively contaminated by the extended halo of scattered light from a nearby bright b star , hd  47887 .",
    "this was also the main problem with the harvard plates ( winn et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "all the plates described in this paper were obtained with 92/67  cm schmidt telescope at the cima ekar station of asiago observatory , between 1967 and 1982 .",
    "we found 48 plates with reasonably long , red - sensitive exposures that were ideally suited for our study .",
    "these were exposed with a i - n emulsion and rg5 filter .",
    "the i - n emulsion was designed for improved sensitivity redward of typical astronomical emulsions , to a cutoff near 9200  @xcite .",
    "the long - pass rg5 filter is identical to the modern rg665 schott filter and blocks wavelengths shorter than 6400 .",
    "together , the i - n / rg5 combination has a transmission curve similar to the @xmath170009000  band pass of the cousins @xmath4 band .",
    "the plates with bluer sensitivity were not as well - suited for accurate photometry , but we wanted to get at least some color information , so we also searched for a few high - quality examples .",
    "we selected 3 plates exposed with a 103a - e emulsion and rg1 filter , which together have a spectral response similar to the johnson @xmath5 band @xcite .",
    "we also selected one plate exposed with a 103a - o emulsion and gg5 filter , giving a spectral response similar to the johnson @xmath6 band .",
    "the contents of our asiago sample can be summarized as 48 @xmath4-like plates , 3 @xmath5-like plates , and one @xmath6-like plate .",
    "these fall into three groups in time , with 41 plates taken from 1967 to 1970 , 6 plates from 1973 to 1976 , and 5 plates from 1979 to 1982 .",

    "a sample digitized image is shown in figure [ field ] .",
    "astronomical photographic emulsions used throughout the last century typically consisted of a suspension of silver halide in a substrate of gelatin @xcite . when light strikes the halide , it produces a distribution of metallic silver grains that is made permanent by chemical development and fixation .",

    "the difference between the average magnitude in the bright state ( defined as @xmath66 ) and the faint state ( @xmath67 ) is @xmath68  mag .",
    "by contrast , the modern eclipse depth is 3.5  magnitudes .",
    "interestingly , the three faintest measurements are also from the most recent time series ( 19791982 ; plotted with asterisks in fig .",

    "the bright state was formerly 0.90 magnitude ( 2.3 times ) brighter than it is today .",
    "one might reasonably wonder whether this surprising discrepancy is due to an error in the zero point of our magnitude relation , or a systematic effect such as contamination by scattered light from hd  47887 .    regarding the accuracy of the zero point , fig .",

    "star 385 is even closer to hd  47887 ( see fig .  1 ) and has @xmath73  mag .",
    "star 404 is also within the halo of scattered light , and has @xmath74  mag , despite being a known variable star @xcite",
    ".      it would be interesting to know whether the decrease in overall brightness was accompanied by a color change .",
    "we have very limited color information , having concentrated on the i - n / rg5 plates , but the few bluer plates in our sample show no evidence for a color change .",
    "in particular , we obtained estimates of @xmath6 and @xmath5 from plates exposed less than one hour apart on 1974  december  15 ( j.d .",

    "the distribution is centered near zero and has standard deviation 0.14 .",
    "[ deltam ] ]      in the 30 years between the earliest group of asiago observations and the determination of the @xcite ephemeris , there have been more than 200 eclipses .",
    "the 0.02-day uncertainty in each period causes a phase uncertainty of @xmath78 in the connection between the modern light curve and the asiago light curve .",
    "yet the phase of minimum light in the asiago light curve occurs at @xmath79 , rather than @xmath80 as in the modern light curve .",
    "this implies , at the 4@xmath81 level , that there has been a shift in the phase of minimum light .    an important caveat , as mentioned in   [ periodicity ] , is that period determination for this system is difficult because the light curve does not repeat exactly from period to period .",
    "we believe it is reasonable that the period uncertainty has been underestimated , despite our best effort and the best effort of herbst et al .",
    "this makes us reluctant to attach too much significance to the apparent phase shift before this point is clarified with additional archival data or continued monitoring .",
    "the fading events of kh  15d were occurring between 1967 and 1982 with nearly the same period and duration as observed today .",
    "however , the system has changed over the past 30 years in two major respects .",
    "first , the bright state has decreased in flux by a factor of 2.3 ( @xmath82  mag ) .",
    "second , the contrast between the bright state and the faint state has increased dramatically .",
    "formerly , the flux of the faint state was 54% of the flux of the bright state ( @xmath83  mag ) . in modern observations ,",
    "the corresponding figure is 4% ( 3.5  mag ) .",
    "interestingly , these two observations could both be explained by a time - independent flux that was present during the asiago observations and not present during the modern observations . a steady light source with 1.3 times the flux of",
    "the eclipsing k7 star would increase the total flux by a factor of 2.3 , and would also dilute the eclipses .",
    "when the k7 star is totally eclipsed , the total flux would be reduced to @xmath84 of the bright state .    to elaborate upon this idea",
    ", we created a smooth model of the 20002001 light curve using b - spline interpolation .",
    "this model is shown as a solid line in figure  [ lc_combo ] .",
    "then we considered three possible transformations of the model light curve : ( 1 ) add a constant light source of magnitude @xmath46 ; ( 2 ) shift the phase by @xmath85 ; and ( 3 ) stretch or compress the eclipse duration by a factor @xmath5 .",
    "we determined the values of @xmath46 , @xmath86 , and @xmath5 that provide the best match to the asiago light curve , using a nonlinear least - squares algorithm .",
    "the best fit was obtained for @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . in figure",
    "[ lc ] , the transformed modern light curve is superposed on the asiago data , and the residuals are plotted beneath the data .",
    "the rms scatter of the residuals is 0.17  mag and the reduced @xmath90 is 2.1 .",
    "the success of this simple model leads us to hypothesize that there is a second star in the kh  15d system .",
    "the second star was formerly blended with the @xmath38 k7 star seen today , but is now completely obscured .",
    "this provides an appealing explanation of the asiago light curve but does raise an obvious question : where did the second star go ?",
    "the most economical answer , in the sense that it requires the fewest new complexities , is that the second star is currently behind the same opaque material that causes the periodic eclipses of the k7 star .",
    "the composition and arrangement of that material are unknown .",
    "some theories are a nearly edge - on circumstellar or protoplanetary disk @xcite , a dusty banana - shaped vortex @xcite , and a cometary distribution of accreting material around a low - mass companion @xcite .",
    "the material might be distributed in such a way that one star is always hidden and the other star comes into view periodically , due to the orbital motion of the kh  15d or the circumstellar material .",
    "if the system is truly a binary , one would expect to see radial velocity variations .",
    "assuming the observed k7 star has a mass of @xmath10.6  @xmath92 , as estimated by hamilton et al .",
    "2001 , and that it is in a 48-day edge - on orbit with a star of similar mass , its orbital velocity would be @xmath130  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is ten times larger than the velocity shift measured by @xcite between two widely separated phases .",
    "of course , it is possible that the full radial velocity curve shows larger variations .",
    "it is also possible that the second star is a wide binary companion , an unrelated background or foreground star , or a binary companion in a nearly face - on orbit .    allowing the possibility of a second star to the system",
    "does not , by itself , explain the eclipses or their evolution .",
    "however , our discovery that kh  15d was brighter in the past puts two of the previous observations of this system in a different light .",
    "one of these is the result of the 19131951 harvard plate analysis .",
    "@xcite derived limits on the fraction of time that the eclipses were @xmath931  mag , but this ignored the possibility that the system was brighter at _ all _ phases in the past .",
    "the more precise statement of the result is that the system was rarely more than 1  mag fainter than the _ modern _ bright state .",
    "more speculatively , there may be a connection to the surprising observation by @xcite that during a few of the re - brightening events , the system became _ brighter _ than the usual bright state by 0.10.5  mag .",
    "perhaps during these events we were allowed a peek at the second star .    with the asiago plates we have discovered several new clues regarding the mysterious eclipses of kh  15d , demonstrating the value of long - term preservation of astronomical images .",
    "it will be interesting to extend the historical analysis with additional plates from the 1980s and 1990s , to reveal when and how the extra light source turned off , and to complete the connection with modern data .",
