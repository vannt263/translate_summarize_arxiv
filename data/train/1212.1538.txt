    "vela x-1 ( 4u 0900 - 40 ) is a an eclipsing and persistently active high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) system consisting of a massive ( @xmath4 ; @xmath5 ) b0.5 1b supergiant hd 77581 @xcite ; and a @xmath6 neutron star @xcite .",
    "it has an orbital period of 8.964 days @xcite with a slightly eccentric orbit ( e @xmath7 0.1 ) .",
    "being a closely spaced binary system @xcite , the neutron star is deeply embedded in the strong stellar wind of the companion which has a mass loss rate in excess of @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is a prototype candidate for accretion via stellar wind , and the typical x - ray luminosity is of the order of @xmath7 @xmath10 ergs @xmath11 .",
    "it exhibits pulsations with a period @xmath7 283 s. the source is extremely variable undergoing giant flares ( where flux increases by a factor of @xmath12 ) , and abrupt off - states , where the source is almost undetectable for several pulse periods @xcite .",
    "+ the structure of the wind and hence the flaring behavior of vela x-1 was investigated by @xcite who also found a systematic trend in the change of column density of absorbing matter along the line of sight in different phase of the the orbit .",
    "the pulse profiles of vela x-1 show a complex structure with multiple energy dependent dips .",
    "this has been explored before for other sources for example in gx 1 + 4 @xcite , rx j0812.4 - 3114 @xcite , 1a 1118 - 61 @xcite , gx 304 - 1 @xcite with _",

    "suzaku_. dips in the pulse profile can be naturally explained due to the absorption in the accretion stream that is phase locked with the neutron star .",
    "the x - ray continuum spectrum of vela x-1 has been modeled with a power law with an exponential cutoff @xcite , or with a negative positive exponential model ( npex ) @xcite .",
    "the continuum is further modified by a considerable amount of photoelectric absorption at low energies which varies erratically on short timescales and also with the orbital phase @xcite .",
    "a strong iron fluorescence feature at @xmath7 6.4 kev has also been reported @xcite . +",
    "an absorption like feature at @xmath7 55 kev was first reported by @xcite using data from _",
    "hexe_. this was interpreted as a cyclotron resonance scattering feature ( crsf ) .",
    "crsf arises due to resonant scattering of electrons in landau levels in the presence of high magnetic fields .",
    "the energy of the crsf is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the centroid energy , z is the gravitational redshift and b is the magnetic field strength of the neutron star .",
    "crsf therefore gives us an estimate of the magnetic field strength of the neutron star .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of the crsf parameters can provide crucial information on the magnetic field geometry and the emission region of the neutron star as we probe it at different viewing angles with spin phase . @xcite and @xcite reported an absorption feature at @xmath7 32 kev from the ginga data .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed analysis of the ginga observations and found that the crsfs vary in strength over the pulse phase .",
    "@xcite also confirmed the existence of two absorption features at @xmath7 23 kev and @xmath7 45 kev using the broadband data from the hexe and ttm , and found similar variations with pulse phase as from the ginga data .",
    "subsequently more detailed pulse phase resolved analysis was performed by @xcite using rxte data who confirmed the existence of the two lines at @xmath7 25 & 55 kev and also reported it s variation with the pulse phase . @xcite and",
    "@xcite performed phase resolved analysis of vela x-1 using _ bepposax _ data but could only confirm the existence of the absorption line at @xmath7 55 kev .",
    "+ we present here a pulse phase resolved spectral analysis of vela x-1 using _ suzaku _ observation in june 2008 .",
    "the same _ suzaku _ observation has been analyzed by @xcite who have mainly focused on the three off - states detected for a few pulses during the observation , and have detected pulsations for the first time in these  off - states  .",
    "they have also analyzed the energy dependent pulse profiles and the energy spectrum in both the off and normal states , and have confirmed the presence of the two crsfs in the normal states .",
    "we have however probed the energy dependence of the pulse profiles in much more detail and carried out pulse phase resolved spectroscopy in narrow phase bins to explore its complex nature .",
    "the variations of the continuum spectral parameters as well as the crsf fundamental and harmonic with pulse phase reported here are the most detailed results available so far .",
    "while performing pulse phase resolved analysis , care has also been taken to average over data having similar intensity and spectral hardness , to probe the variation solely due to the changing viewing angle with pulse phase . in section",
    "@xmath3 we describe the observation and data reduction , in section @xmath15 the pulse profiles including it s energy and intensity dependence , in section @xmath16 spectroscopy , including phase averaged and phase resolved followed by discussions and conclusions in section @xmath17 .",
    "vela x-1 has been observed with _ suzaku _",
    "@xcite on june 17 - 18 2008 ( obs .",
    "id403045010 ) .",
    "the observation ( exposure @xmath7 103 ks ) was performed at hxd nominal pointing position .",
    "_ suzaku _ has two sets of instruments on board , the x - ray imaging spectrometer xis @xcite covering the 0.2 - 12 kev range , the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) having pin diodes @xcite covering the energy range of 1070 kev , and gso crystal scintillator detectors covering the 70600 kev energy band .",
    "the xis consists of four ccd detectors , three of which are front illuminated ( fi : xis0 , xis2 , xis3 ) and one back illuminated ( bi : xis1 ) . since the loss of xis2 in 2006 november ,",
    "only xis 0 , 1 & 3 are operational . for this observation",
    ", the xis s were operated in normal clock mode in the @xmath18 window option which gave a time resolution of 2 s. + heasoft 6.11 was used for the reduction and extraction . for the reduction and extraction of the xis data",
    ", the unfiltered xis events were reprocessed with the caldb version 20100123 for xis and 20091007 for hxd .",
    "the reprocessed xis event files were then checked for the possible presence of photon pile - up .",
    "pile - up estimation was performed by examining the point spread function ( psf ) of the xis s by checking the count rate per one ccd exposure at the image peak as given by yamada & takahashi .",
    "following their procedure , the value obtained was higher than that of crab nebula count rate of 36 ct / sq arcmin / s ( ccd exposure ) , and the radius at which this value equals 36 in the psf is about 15 - 16 arcsec .",
    "thus the check performed showed a case of moderate photon pile up , and 15 pixels from the image center were removed to account for this effect .",
    "for the extraction of xis light curves and spectra from the reprocessed xis data , a circular region of @xmath19 diameter was selected around the source centroid with the central 15 ( @xmath7 @xmath20 ) pixels removed .",
    "background light curves and spectra were extracted by selecting a region of the same size away from the source .",
    "the xis count rate after the pile - up correction was around @xmath7 @xmath21 c @xmath11 with @xmath22 of the photons being lost due to the removal of the photons from the central region .",
    "response files and effective area files were generated by using the ftools task xisresp. for extracting hxd / pin light curves and spectra , cleaned event files were used ( processing version 2.2.8.20 ) . for hxd / pin background , simulated tuned non x - ray background event files ( nxb ) corresponding to june 2008 were used to estimate the non x - ray background , and the cosmic x - ray background was simulated as suggested by the instrument team applying appropriate normalizations for both cases .",
    "response files of the respective observations were obtained from the _ suzaku _ guest observatory facility .",
    "for the timing analysis , we applied barycentric corrections to the event data files using the ftools task aebarycen. light curves with a time resolution of 2 s and 1 s were extracted from the xiss ( 0.212 kev ) and the hxd / pin ( 1070 kev ) , respectively .",
    "pulsations were searched in the data by applying pulse folding and @xmath23 maximization technique .",
    "the best estimate of the period was found to be @xmath24 s. we also checked for the correction of the pulse arrival times due to the orbital motion of the neutron star which showed that the filtered events corresponded to an orbital phase @xmath7 0.17 to 0.36 .",
    "the orbital motion curve however fitted well to a straight line in this phase range .",
    "this implies only a linear correction in the pulse arrival times which would not alter our results on pulse phase resolved spectroscopy significantly .",
    "thus orbital correction for the pulse arrival times was not required .",
    "the pulse period has been determined for the same dataset to a greater precision by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the average pulse profile of vela x-1 created by folding the light curve with the obtained pulse period .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the light curves of vela x-1 rebinned with the timebin equal to the pulse period as obtained from the xis and pin data respectively .",
    "the light curves show that the source is highly variable .",
    "panel 3 of the same figure shows the hardness ratio ( ratio of pin counts to xis counts ) for the entire stretch . except for the brief initial stretch at the beginning , the hardness ratio remains nearly constant upto the first 90000 s after which it is more variable with an increasing trend .",
    "for this above mentioned constant hardness ratio stretch , arrows in panel 1 also show the `` off - states '' in the xis light curve as is presented in @xcite . since the main aim of this work is to perform pulse phase resolved spectroscopy to probe the spectral parameters with changing viewing angle , we took only this stretch of constant hardness ratio excluding the  off - states  for further analysis .",
    "this would ensure that our results would be free from any systematic effects of phase average spectral variability .",
    "as already mentioned earlier , since the main aim of this work is to probe the pulse phase dependence of the spectral parameters , we also checked for the intensity dependence of the pulse profiles to avoid averaging over data having different luminosity dependence .",
    "intensity dependent pulse profiles were created using both xis ( 0.3 - 12 kev ) and pin ( 10 - 70 kev ) for the above mentioned stretch of the data having similar hardness ratio and excluding the  off - states \" .",
    "pulse profiles were created in three intensity windows having characteristic xis count rates @xmath25 20 c @xmath11 , 20 - 50 c @xmath11 and @xmath26 50 c @xmath11 by applying intensity filtering .",
    "figure 3 shows the intensity dependent pulse profiles in the xis and pin energy band respectively .",
    "the xis and the pin profiles also show similar characteristics in all the intensity bands except for a slightly larger pulse fraction in xis at low count rate ( @xmath25 20 ) and in pin at medium count rate ( 20 - 50 ) . the xis pulse profile created with counts greater than 50 however differs considerably , with the dips and peaks in some phases not coinciding as can be seen from the figure , the dip in the highest intensity profile at phase @xmath7 0.6 coincides with a peak in the other intensity band profiles . to avoid this intensity dependence we averaged over data only in the intensity band of @xmath25 50 c @xmath11 to perform spectral analysis .",
    "energy resolved pulse profiles were created by folding the light curves in different energy bands with the obtained pulse period . in light of the issues discussed in the above sections ,",
    "pulse profiles were created for the constant hardness ratio stretch excluding the `` off - states '' and in the intensity band of @xmath25 50 @xmath11 .",
    "this is different from that presented by @xcite who have compared the energy resolved pulse profiles between the on and `` off - states '' .",
    "our main goal is to avoid the systematic effects which might affect our results of pulse phase resolved spectroscopy described later in section 4.2 .",
    "the energy dependence of the pulse profiles is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the pulse profiles from 0.3 - 12 kev are created using all the three xiss ( 0 , 1 & 3 ) .",
    "higher energy profiles are created from the pin data .",
    "the figure shows that the pulse profiles have complex energy dependent structures , with upto five peaks in the xis energy band which merge to two asymmetric peaks in the pin energy band . with a careful examination of the pulse profiles ,",
    "the following characteristics can be observed ( refer figure  [ fig4 ] for the exact location of the low energy peaks )    1 .",
    "the first two peaks in the low energy profiles at phases @xmath7 0.2 and 0.5 ( henceforth termed peaks a and b ) merge to become a single asymmetric peak ( phase @xmath7 0.3 ) at @xmath26 12 kev .",
    "the next three peaks of the low energy profiles at phases @xmath7 0.6 , 0.8 and 1 ( henceforth termed peaks c , d and e ) merge to become the second high energy peak ( phase @xmath7 0.9 ) after 12 kev .",
    "the dip at phase @xmath7 0.3 between the peaks a and b decreases with energy and disappears at @xmath7 12 kev .",
    "the dip at phase @xmath7 0.7 between the peaks c and d however increases with energy upto 5 kev after which it shows a decreasing trend and disappears at @xmath7 14 kev .",
    "the dip at phase @xmath7 0.9 between the peaks d and e also decreases with energy and disappears at @xmath7 7 kev .",
    "there is also an indication of a dip like structure at the lowest energies ( @xmath25 5 kev ) between phase 0.5 - 0.6 .",
    "we performed pulse phase averaged spectral analysis of vela x-1 using spectra from the front illuminated ccds spectrum ( xiss-0 and 3 ) , back illuminated ccd spectrum ( xis 1 ) and the pin spectrum .",
    "as discussed earlier we extracted spectra only for the above mentioned stretch of the data having similar hardness ratio , excluded the `` off - states '' , and further applied intensity filtering to choose the time within it having count rates @xmath25 50 c @xmath11 .",
    "spectral fitting was performed using _ xspec _ v12.7.0 .",
    "the energy ranges chosen for the fits were 0.8 - 10 kev for the xiss and 12 - 70 kev for the pin spectrum respectively .",
    "due to an artificial structure in the xis spectra around the si edge and au edge , the energy range of 1.75 - 2.23 kev was neglected . after appropriate background subtraction",
    "we fitted the spectra simultaneously with all parameters tied , except the relative instrument normalizations which were kept free .",
    "the xis spectra were rebinned by a factor of 6 from 0.8 - 6 kev and 7 - 10 kev , and by a factor of 2 between 6 - 7 kev .",
    "the pin spectra were rebinned by a factor of 2 upto 22 kev , by 4 upto 45 kev , and 6 upto 70 kev .",
    "+ the continuum was fitted with both a phenomenological high - energy cutoff highecut model and a more physical comptonization model comptt assuming a spherical geometry for the comptonizing region @xcite . in both the cases along with the galactic line of sight absorption",
    ", a partial covering absorption model pcfabs was applied to take into account the intrinsic absorption local to the neutron star .",
    "a gaussian line was also used to model the narrow fe k@xmath27 feature found at 6.4 kev . in addition",
    ", two absorption features were found at 25 and 50 kev , which are the crsf fundamental and harmonic as found previously for this source .",
    "these were modeled with lorentzian profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the best - fitting spectra along with the residuals .",
    "since the energy spectrum has a strong pulse phase dependence , we do not expect the pulse phase averaged spectrum to fit well to a simple continuum model .",
    "the best - fitting parameters for the high energy cutoff highecut model and the comptt model are given in table 1 .",
    "the best fit had a reduced @xmath23 of 2.03 for 831 d.o.f for the highecut model and 1.92 for 832 d.o.f for the comptt model respectively .",
    "the value of the additional absorption component ( @xmath28 ) and the covering fraction ( @xmath29 ) are higher for the comptt model .",
    "the fundamental crsf has similar parameters for both the models except for a slightly wider line in the case of the comptt model .",
    "the harmonic is however much deeper and wider in the case of comptt model .",
    "the continuum model used by @xcite is slightly different from ours since they used a combination of powerlaw and comptt model while we have used a partial covering comptt model . as a result , the galactic line of sight absorption ( @xmath30 ) value obtained in our analysis is lower , and the comptonization parameters are also different .",
    "the cyclotron parameters however match well and are consistent with each other within error bars . keeping in mind that ecycl from the lorentzian description does not define the minimum of the line profile @xcite , from the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 we obtained with the lorentzian ( cyclabs ) model , the corresponding minimum of the line profile are calculated to be at 26.8 kev and 56.3 kev which are consistent with the values obtained by @xcite within error bars .",
    "the depth and width of the cyclotron lines are also consistent .",
    "+ confidence contours were plotted to check the inter dependence between some of the parameters for both the models .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the @xmath23 confidence contours between several pairs of model parameters for the phase averaged spectra . among the continuum parameters when both were allowed to vary , the partial covering parameters @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29 could be constrained well within 14 % and 8 % of the respective parameter values for the highecut model .",
    "there were however limitations in this model like the break energy e - cut and the fundamental crsf @xmath31 were found to be correlated and could not be well constrained independently .",
    "the contour between @xmath31 and the powerlaw photon index ( @xmath33 ) showed that although @xmath33 could be constrained very well , @xmath31 could not be .",
    "the fundamental being very shallow , and possibly because of the correlation with the break energy and inability to constrain against @xmath33 in the highecut model , the energy and depth of the fundamental could not be constrained completely independent of these parameters .",
    "however , similar trend of the variation of the fundamental line energy obtained with pulse phase for both the models give us an added confidence on our results . @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the comptt model also could be constrained well ( 11 % and 6 % of their values ) .",
    "the optical depth and electron temperature @xmath34 and @xmath35 showed some correlation but could be constrained between 18 % and 4 % of their values .",
    "the interdependence between the parameters discussed above were also evident from the results of the pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of the parameters discussed later . for the cyclotron line parameters , both",
    "the crsfs could be constrained well in the case of the comptt model and showed no dependence both among themselves or with the continuum parameters like @xmath34 and @xmath35. in the case of highecut model although parameters of the crsf harmonic could be constrained well , the @xmath31 and @xmath36 contour maps showed dependency and difficulty in constraining both the parameters simultaneously .",
    "however the similar trend of variation of the parameters obtained with both the spectral models as discussed above gives us confidence on our obtained results . because of some of the limitations discussed here , the errors quoted and plotted henceforth are assuming variation of only one parameter , with the other parameters allowed to vary independently to find the minimum @xmath23 .      strong energy dependence of the pulse profiles , as shown in figure 4 implies dependence of the energy spectrum on the pulse phase .",
    "the narrow energy dependent dips in the pulse profiles can also be explained by a partial covering absorption model in which the absorber is phase locked with the neutron star . to investigate this we performed pulse phase resolved spectroscopy , applying phase filtering in the ftools task xselect .",
    "for the phase resolved analysis we used the same background spectra and response matrices as was used for the phase averaged spectrum for both the xis s and the pin data .",
    "we also fitted the spectra in the same energy range and rebinned them by the same factor as in phase averaged case .",
    "the value of the galactic absorption ( @xmath30 ) and the fe line width were frozen to the phase averaged values for the two respective models . +      to investigate the pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of the two crsfs we generated phase resolved spectra with the phases centered around as in the case of 25 independent bins but at thrice their widths .",
    "this resulted in 25 overlapping bins out of which only 8 were independent .",
    "due to limited statistics we were unable to constrain all the parameters , and froze the width of the crsf harmonic to the phase averaged value of the respective models and varied the rest of the parameters with pulse phase . for phases close to or at the off pulse regions ,",
    "the crsfs are weak and sometimes can not be detected in the spectra for either or both of the continuum models .",
    "confidence contours were created for the pairs of parameters as shown in panels b , c , d , e , h , i , j , k in figure 6 for some of the phase resolved spectra .",
    "the fundamental @xmath31 , when paired with the parameters @xmath36 , e - cut or @xmath33 could not be constrained simultaneously as was the case with the phase averaged spectrum .",
    "for all the other pairs , the parameters could be constrained fairly well with the errors being @xmath7 1.5 times the corresponding errors with the phase averaged spectrum .",
    "refer section 4.1    figure [ fig6 ] shows the variation of the cyclotron parameters for both the models as a function of pulse phase . despite statistical limitations in the data to constrain the crsf fundamental energy and depth independent of the cutoff energy in the highecut model , the variation of the crsf parameters",

    "we have however investigated the complex energy dependence of the pulse profiles and probed the narrow dips of the same in much more detail .",
    "presence of double peaked pulses at high energies have been found previously in some sources for example in xte j1946 + 274 @xcite , 4u 1538 - 52 @xcite , gx 301 - 2 @xcite etc .",
    "they can either be interpreted due to a fan beam pattern of the emission geometry , or that due to the contribution from both the magnetic poles .",
    "the low energy complex pulse profiles are however more difficult to interpret since they are affected due to scattering and absorption in the local environment of the neutron star .",
    "the dips in the low energy profiles can be explained due to an additional absorption component in our line of sight , probably by the passage of a phase locked accretion stream or the accretion column itself .",
    "this aspect is discussed in more detail below .",
    "we have performed pulse phase resolved spectroscopy to probe the complex energy dependence of the pulse profiles .",
    "the dips in the pulse profiles at phases @xmath7 0.3 , 0.5 - 0.6 , 0.7 and 0.9 can be explained due to an increase in the additional absorption column density @xmath28 with a corresponding change in the covering fraction at that phase .",
    "the changes in the value of @xmath28 and covering fraction with pulse phase can act as a tracer for the properties of the plasma in the accretion stream , which may be a clumpy structure having different values of opacities and optical depths .",
    "the fitted parameters of the highecut model shows an abrupt increase in the value of @xmath28 at the dips at phases @xmath7 0.3 and 0.9 .",
    "the dip at phase @xmath7 0.3 extends upto somewhat higher energies , the value of @xmath28 of the former being higher than that at phase @xmath7 0.9 .",
    "both of the dips have similar strength in agreement with similar values of covering fraction in both the cases .",
    "the main dip at phase 0.5 - 0.6 may be indicated by a slight increase in @xmath28 with a high value of the covering fraction .",
    "the dip at phase @xmath7 0.7 is different from the others since it increases in strength upto 5 kev and then decreases and disappears after 20 kev , being relatively shallower than the other dips in the pulse profile .",
    "this dip is in agreement with a large increase in @xmath28 and a very small covering fraction , with the value of @xmath28 peaking at this particular phase .",
    "this would indicate the presence of a very dense clump of matter ( a narrow and dense stream ) , with the high value of @xmath28 responsible for the dip extending upto higher energies .",
    "in general the covering fraction decreases at the dips in the profile where @xmath28 is larger , which may indicate a clumpy structure of the accretion stream .",
    "the highecut model is thus able to explain the energy dependence of the pulse profiles very well .",
    "the parameters obtained by fitting the spectra with the comptt model on the other hand , does not show a similar pattern of variation of the partial covering model specially for the case of the covering fraction parameter .",
    "the dip at phase @xmath7 0.7 also does not show any significant increase in @xmath28 , although the optical depth ( @xmath34 ) parameter of the comptt model increases at all phases corresponding to the dips .",
    "we would however like to point out that the comptt model may not be a good description of the low energy part of the pulsar spectra keeping in mind that the n@xmath43 and the covering fraction were found to have some dependence ( mentioned earlier in section 4.2.2 ) .",
    "in addition , it is a highly simplified model with a spherical shape of the comptonizing cloud whereas the emission region in accreting pulsars are likely to have a slab or cylindrical geometry .",
    "the highecut model inspite of being a phenomenological model and having a divergent property at low energies when paired with a powerlaw , is able to explain the complex energy dependence of the pulse profile better .",
    "another interesting result found is the spectral hardening at the high energy pulse peaks .",
    "the power law index ( @xmath33 ) reaches it s minima at these phases , more so for the phase corresponding to the second peak ( phase @xmath7 0.9 ) .",
    "similar regions of pulse hardening have been observed previously in other sources like her x-1 @xcite , 4u 0115 + 63 @xcite & gx 1 + 4 @xcite & 1a 1118 - 61 @xcite . assuming the spectral formation by the comptonization of photons by the thermal electrons , the compton @xmath44 parameter can be used as a measure for the degree of comptonization .",
    "it is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the electron temperature and @xmath34 the optical depth .",
    "the higher is the degree of comptonization the larger is the",
    "parameter , and hence harder is the spectrum .",
    "`` y '' can be easily found since @xmath47 and @xmath34 are the parameters of the comptt model . calculating it shows that the `` y '' values also peak at more or less the same phase as the hardest @xmath33 , i.e at the pulse peaks with the phase corresponding to the second peak having a higher value of `` y '' .",
    "@xmath48 at all the phases , which is indicative of saturated comptonization being prevalent in the the spectrum .",
    "we also checked for the correspondence between ",
    "@xmath33  and `` y '' at all other phases .",
    "the parameters seem to be correlated with each other with the spearman rank correlation coefficient equal to -0.89 .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the interdependence between the two parameters .",
    "we would like to caution however that the comptt model assumes spherical geometry for the plasma region which is a crude approximation for the accretion column which has a cylindrical or slab geometry in most cases .",
    "hence this may give rise to some systematic errors in the results .",
    "we also performed pulse phase resolved spectral analysis of the two crsf features .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of the cyclotron parameters have been performed for some sources previously , for example in her x-1 @xcite , 4u 1538 - 52 @xcite , 4u0115 + 63 @xcite , vela x-1 @xcite , cen x-3 @xcite , and more recently in gx 301 - 2 @xcite , 1a 1118 - 61 @xcite and 4u 1626 - 67 @xcite .",
    "we have obtained detailed results on the variation of both the crsf s of vela x-1 with the pulse phase .",
    "both the highecut and comptt models used by us to fit the spectra give comparable results .",
    "this gives us more confidence on the obtained pattern of variation .",
    "the results are also very similar to that obtained by @xcite with _ rxte _ but they did not have enough sensitivity to probe these variations in detail",
    ". there have also been attempts to model the crsf features analytically by assuming certain physics and geometry of the line forming region by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "all these models predict significant variations in the depth , width and the centroid energy of the crsf features with the changing viewing angle at different pulse phases .",
    "they also predict possible deviation or distortion from the simple dipole geometry of the magnetic field , and deviation of the line ratios from the classical value of two .",
    "vela x-1 has a shallow and narrow fundamental , and a deep and wide harmonic ( refer table 1 ) .",
    "this may happen due to photon spawning by raman scattering at higher harmonics ( refer @xcite ) , or the superposition of a large number of lines from different sites in the line forming region @xcite may also make the fundamental crsf appear shallower . @xcite further predicts a shallow and narrow fundamental and a deeper and wider second harmonic would imply large viewing angle w.r.t the magnetic field .",
    "a fan like beam would be expected for vela x-1 in this case . as is mentioned in section @xmath49",
    "the ratio of the two line energies is @xmath50 at many phases .",
    "according to @xcite , this would favor a line forming region with a large polar cap or of a greater height .",
    "the fundamental would be formed at a higher site and second harmonic primarily around the bottom . as a result @xmath51",
    "is expected .",
    "+ the electron temperature `` @xmath35 '' is high at the phases corresponding to the wider crsfs , specially at the ascending edges of the high energy pin pulse peaks . for a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of electrons",
    "the observed crsf fwhm is given as : @xcite @xmath52 , where @xmath47 is the electron temperature , @xmath53 the crsf energy , and @xmath54 the viewing angle w.r.t the magnetic field .",
    "this implies a higher @xmath47 would result into a higher @xmath55 as is obtained .",
    "the fundamental line is deepest at the ascending edge of the pulse phase .",
    "the deepest second harmonic is also in the descending edge of the main pulse and very shallow outside the pulses .",
    "@xcite predicts these signatures would imply looking at a very large viewing angle w.r.t the magnetic field at those phases and hence a fan beam like emission pattern would be expected .",
    "all these are however assuming the contribution from one of the magnetic poles of the neutron star , and results may be complicated further with the contribution from the other pole .",
