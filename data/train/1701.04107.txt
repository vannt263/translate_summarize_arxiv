    "we are fine if @xmath176 , thus we only need to examine the case @xmath177 , which we assume until the end of the section .",
    "the last equation says that there are exactly two triples with two @xmath23-sets from @xmath38 .",

    "we have two possible configurations in which @xmath177 .",

    "finally , assume that there is at least one @xmath73-element set @xmath185 .",
    "then , as one can see from fig .",
    "2 , it forbids at least one @xmath62-set of each of the types 1a and 1b to appear .",
    "denote them @xmath186 .",
    "we have seen two paragraphs before that in either case of the arrangement of the @xmath23-sets we forbid sets of the same type ( either one of type 1a , or two of type 1b ) .",
    "therefore , there is at least one out of @xmath186 that did not get any charge at stage 5 .",
    "we assume that it is a set @xmath187 of type 1b ( the other case is absolutely analogous , and even simpler ) .",
    "since @xmath187 appears in two triples and got some charge only at stage 4 , the charge of @xmath187 after all five stages is at most @xmath188 .",

    "this gives @xmath208 missing sets .",
    "thus , we may assume that there are no sets of size smaller than @xmath209 in @xmath13 .",
