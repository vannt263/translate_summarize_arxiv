    "<S> we discover numerically that a moving wave packet in a quantum chaotic billiard will always evolve into a quantum state , whose density probability distribution is exponential . </S>",
    "<S> this exponential distribution is found to be universal for quantum chaotic systems with rigorous proof . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the corresponding classical system , the distribution is gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quantum exponential distribution can smoothly change to the classical gaussian distribution with coarse graining .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of quantum chaos intends to elucidate the intriguing correspondence between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics by focusing on the effects of chaos of a classical system on its quantum counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> intensive efforts have found certain universal characteristics of quantum chaotic systems , for example , the wigner distribution of energy level spacing @xcite and the scarring `` of eigenstates along the classical periodic orbits@xcite . by following a pioneering work @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamical evolution of a moving wave packet inside a ripple quantum billiard @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the wave packet evolution always leads to an equilibrium '' state , where the density probability is exponentially distributed . with rigorous proof , </S>",
    "<S> we show that this exponential distribution is universal for all quantum chaotic systems . </S>",
    "<S> this exponential law is in stark contrast with the evolution of a cloud \" of classical particles , which always leads to a gaussian distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this universal behavior is observable with bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and other quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate that the quantum - classical correspondence between the exponential distribution and the gaussian distribution can be achieved with coarse graining . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the following schrdinger equation with the units @xmath0@xmath1where @xmath2 represents the hard - wall potential for a ripple billiard ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the left and right walls are described by functions @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the initial wave function is a moving gaussian wave packet given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the ground - state wave function in a harmonic trap @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the wave packet density @xmath7 is shown in figs.fig1a1-a4 for the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the time is in the unit of @xmath13 , which is the longest time for a classical particle making a round - trip along the @xmath14 direction inside the billiard . </S>",
    "<S> as clearly seen in the figure , the wave packet moves and expands , and eventually gets reflected multiple times by the curved hard walls . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the wave packet gets smeared out in the billiard . </S>",
    "<S> after about @xmath15 , the density of the wave packet reaches kind of an  equilibrium \" state , where the overall features of the wave packet no longer changes . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the same wave packet in a square billiard ( @xmath16 ) is shown in figs.[fig1]b1-b4 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is obvious : in the square billiard , the wave packet always has certain patterns , looking very regular , and it never settles into any fixed pattern .    with the inspiration to describe quantitatively the contrasting images between figs.[fig1]a3-a4 and figs.[fig1]b3-b4 </S>",

    "<S> the resulted density probability distribution is a gaussian with its peak located at the averaged density , drastically different from the exponential distribution for a quantum gas . to confirm this </S>",

    "<S> however , the density probability distribution function for the classical cloud after long time evolution is gaussian ( see fig.fig3b ) as we just expected . as a result , we can say that the exponential distribution is a quantum effect and it can be used in experiment to tell whether a gas is quantum or classical .    . </S>",

    "<S> many of these eigenstates tend to scar over classical periodic orbitsheller1984prl . </S>",
    "<S> this means that eigenstates have some regular pattern and it should not have the exponential distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked this numerically and one example is shown in fig.[fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the density probability distribution of an eigenstate was studied in literature in terms of amplitude probability distribution and no similar universal behavior was found@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the central question in the study of quantum chaos is how the classicality observed in our daily life emerges from the underlying quantum world @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is very interesting to see how the classical gaussian distribution emerges from the quantum exponential distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quantum - classical correspondence in this regard is built by coarse graining . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the density of the random wave in eq.(randomwavefunction ) for an area of @xmath84 . to obtain the density probability distribution @xmath85 </S>",

    "<S> this is because we can not resist the temptation to compare it with the equilibrium state in thermodynamics . in thermodynamics </S>",
    "<S> , a system will always evolve into an equilibrium state after fully relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> after the equilibrium is reached , the state still changes microscopically ; however , the corresponding macroscopic observables do not change , in particular , the statistical distribution function no longer changes . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same here for the long - time quantum state : after a certain long time ( @xmath86 in our case ) , the quantum state still changes locally while its overall structure remains the same and the density probability distribution function sticks to the exponential law . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to compare the hyper - sphere in the hilbert space defined by the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) to the hyper - sphere in the phase space defined by a constant energy . as we know </S>",
    "<S> , for almost all the microscopic states in the phase space sphere , they share the same macroscopic characteristics , such as the same pressure and the same thermal expansion coefficient . similarly , with the understanding that we have gained so far , almost all the states in the hilbert space should have the exponential distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is true that there are many states such as the eigenstate shown in fig.[fig4 ] , which do not have the exponential distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect the measure of these states is zero . in light of this discussion , it is likely that this exponential distribution is related to the thermalization of isolated quantum systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum chaotic system has been defined as the quantum system whose corresponding classical system is chaotic . with the exponential distribution law , we may be now ready to define quantum chaotic system without referring to classical system . </S>",
    "<S> one might choose to define a quantum chaotic system as a quantum system which has the ability to drive an initially regular wave packet to a coherent superposition of completely random wave functions , which has the observable exponential density probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we finally note that for the exponential distribution , the density fluctuation is @xmath87 , which is much larger than the gaussian distribution . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum fluctuation in density is much larger than the classical fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> this large quantum fluctuation in density may help to explain the formation of stars if a wave function for the whole universe is assumed@xcite . </S>"
