    "the sun could copiously emit weakly interacting particles , that could eventually be detected inside a sensitive detector at the earth .",
    "r6 cm     axion is one of such particles .",
    "the existence of axion is implied to solve the strong cp problem  @xcite .",
    "axions are expected to be produced in the solar core through their coupling to photons . this process is called primakoff process .",
    "the outgoing axion has average energy of about 4 kev  @xcite .",
    "sikivie proposed an ingenious experiment to detect such axions  @xcite .",
    "a detection schematics of solar axion is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : incident ] .",
    "the detection device called axion helioscope is a system of a strong magnet and an x - ray detector , where the solar axions are transformed into x - ray photons through the inverse primakoff process in the magnetic field .",
    "conversion is coherently enhanced even for massive axions by filling the conversion region with light gas .",
    "if the axion mass @xmath4 is at around a few ev , detection of the solar axion becomes feasible .",
    "hidden sector photon is another kind of weakly interacting particles .",
    "the existence of hidden photons is predicted by several extensions of standard model .",
    "if light hidden photons exist , they could be produced through kinetic mixing with solar photons  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider the sun as a source of low energy hidden photons .",
    "a detection schematics of hidden photon from the sun is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : incident ] . unlike the case of the axion , no magnetic field is required to transform photons into hidden photons .",
    "in this paper we report the current status of two experiments .",
    "one is the search for solar axions and the other is the search for hidden photons from the sun .",
    "the schematic figure of the axion helioscope is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumico ] .",
    "it consists of a superconducting magnet , x - ray detectors , a gas container , and an altazimuth mounting .",
    "the magnet  @xcite consists of two 2.3-m long race - track shaped superconducting coils running parallel with a 20-mm wide gap between them .",
    "the transverse magnetic field in the gap is @xmath5 .",
    "the magnetic field can be maintained without an external power supply with a help of a persistent current switch .",
    "the magnet is kept lower than @xmath6 by two gifford - mcmahon refrigerators . the container to hold dispersion - matching gas",
    "is inserted in the aperture of the magnet .",
    "it is made of four 2.3-m long stainless - steel square pipes and 5n high purity aluminium sheets wrapping around them to achieve high uniformity of temperature .",
    "the measured thermal conductance between the both ends was @xmath7 at @xmath6 under @xmath5 .",
    "the one end of the gas container is suspended by three kevlar cords .",
    "the other end at the opposite side is flanged to the magnet .",
    "this end is terminated with an x - ray window which is transparent above @xmath8 and can hold gas up to @xmath9 . the gas introducing pipelines are also at this side and have an automated gas controlling system which enables us to scan wide range of axion mass .",
    "the generated x - ray is viewed by sixteen pin photodiodes .",
    "details on the x - ray detector are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . except for the gas controlling system ,",
    "they are constructed in a vacuum vessel which is mounted on an altazimuth mount to track the sun .",
    "it can track the sun about a half of a day . during the other half of a day",
    ", background spectrum is measured .",
    "phase 1 of the solar observation was performed in december 1997 without the gas container  @xcite .",
    "phase 2 was performed from july to september 2000 with the gas container and low density helium gas  @xcite .",
    "phase 3 was performed from december 2007 to april 2008 with higher density helium gas than that of phase 2  @xcite .",
    "since those measurements result in no positive signals of axion , upper limits on the axion - photon coupling constant @xmath10 were set to be @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "we are now preparing the search for solar axion with mass over 1 ev introducing higher density helium gas than that of last phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : sumicoresult ] shows the expected upper limit of next measurement .",
    "our previous limits and the some other bounds are also plotted in the same figure .",
    "the solax  @xcite , cosme  @xcite , dama  @xcite and cdms  @xcite are solar axions experiments which exploit the coherent conversion on the crystalline plains in germanium and a nai detector .",
    "the experiment by lazarus et al .",

    "it mainly consists of a vacuum vessel as a conversion region , a parabolic mirror , and a photomultiplier ( pmt ) . in one side of the vessel",
    ", the parabolic mirror is attached to collect photons produced from the hidden photon - photon oscillation and the focal point of the mirror is set at the other side of the vessel .",
    "the mirror has a diameter of 50 cm , and a focal length of 1 m. on the focal point , the pmt is attached to detect collected photons .",
    "in addition , we plan to cool the pmt to reduce dark count rate . as a preliminary experiment",
    ", we have cooled r329 - 02 , a product of hamamatsu photonics , and measured its dark count rate .",
    "the measured rate at @xmath16 was about @xmath17 .",
    "this rate is several times lower than a dark count rate at room temperature . for actual experiment",
    ", we plan to use a more suitable one than r329 - 02 .",
    "if we suppose the dark count rate is @xmath17 , pressure in the vessel is much less than @xmath18 , the length of conversion region is @xmath19 , the diameter of the mirror is @xmath20 , reflectivity of the mirror is @xmath21 , and measuring time is @xmath22 , we expect an exclusion region above the solid line shown in fig .",
