    "even with detailed models it can be difficult to reach a conclusive interpretation . further complicating this picture is that some sne  iin initially reveal a thomson scattering profile but evolve to a shocked profile @xcite .",
    "if we suppose both the presence of thomson scattering in a pre - existing circumstellar medium ( csm ) in order to produce the line structures , and that the transient is a true sn based on its energetics , then we would expect a shock wave to be propagating through the csm with observable effects . significantly modifying the line structures",

    ", the line formation radius will be consistent with the photometric radius for @xmath163 , roughly as needed to broaden the lines with thomson scattering .",
    "a shock propagating through such a medium releases a significant amount of energy , with a shock luminosity of @xmath178 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where we have set the shock velocity to 2000kms@xmath4 , an intermediate velocity between the narrow and broad components . while this energy can be lost to re - accelerating the expansion of the flow , on these physical scales it will tend to be radiated .",
    "the natural shock temperature is @xmath179  kev .",
    "if the optical depth of the wind is low , the x - rays from the shock can not be thermalized and simply escape .",
    "averaging over the x - ray epochs from 11 november to 17 january ( days 43 - 110 ) gives a detection with @xmath180 .",
    "these can be reconciled by having a low optical depth , @xmath181 corresponding to a mass loss rate of a few @xmath182  year@xmath4 .",
    "a possible difficulty is that at the low shock densities implied by this optical depth , one would be directly observing the shock and would expect to see the characteristic emission lines associated with fast shocks ( e.g. the late time spectra of sn  1980k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although they would be heavily diluted by the large ratio between the shock and photospheric luminosities .",
    "the alternative is to make the medium dense enough so that the x - rays are absorbed before they escape ( see the recent discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the densities and temperatures we expect to see in the shell ,",
    "the material is likely to be incompletely ionized , which means that the optical opacity ( dominated by electron scattering ) will be low compared to the x - ray opacity ( e.g. figure  [ fig - opac ] ) . in these conditions , @xmath183 and ,",
    "if we require @xmath184 to fit the line profiles , the high x - ray optical depth will be sufficient to severely limit the softer x - rays to which _ swift _ is most sensitive .",
    "there is an upper bound of @xmath185 where @xmath186 begins to exceed the bolometric luminosity of the transient .",
    "if we follow the argument of @xcite and try to produce all the luminosity from an embedded shock , the energy available to heat the medium is @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is how long it takes the energy to escape . we equate this with the radiative energy @xmath189 to estimate a temperature @xmath190 thermalizing the shock photons to limit the x - ray transmittance places constraints on the ionization state of the atoms .",
    "to explain the line profiles , we require @xmath191 .",
    "but the optical depth can not be too high , or the photon diffusion time becomes too long and the shock breaks out before the radiation .",
    "this also implies that @xmath185 .",
    "the mass associated with the shell is then @xmath192 where we have used @xmath193  @xmath194  g@xmath4 for a largely ionized medium , but in can be lower if the h / he are able to partially recombine ( see figure  [ fig - opac ] ) .",
    "theses masses and mass loss rates in these high luminosity models are typical of other type  iin sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are in the range of lbvs in eruption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is one additional attractive feature of surrounding an explosive transient with a discontinuous shell of material .",
    "namely , it might be able to explain the large photospheric radius and low temperature of the first few epochs ( see figure  [ fig - bb ] ) .",
    "when the shock breaks out of the surface of the star , it produces a luminosity uv / x - ray spike in excess of @xmath195 in a brief burst .",
    "the duration depends on the structure of the star , wind profile and the photon energy , but the bulk of the breakout emission occurs well within 10,000s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a shell geometry",
    ", this short radiation spike rapidly crosses to the shell and then photoionizes it before escaping .",
    "but if the radiation interacts in the shell , it is spread over the diffusion time @xmath196  days , which is relatively well - matched to the duration and apparent photospheric scales of the initial phase .",
    "the problem is that the required luminosity is at the high end of what we might expect from shock breakout .",
    "this can be explored further once the nature of this transient is fully understood .",
    "sn  2011ht shows a series of curious behaviors . it has a spectrum broadly resembling a dense stellar wind but the overall luminosity and energetics of a true core - collapse sn .",
    "it appeared to have a very large , cool photosphere initially , which then shrinks to roughly a constant before starting to slowly expand .",
    "the apparent temperature rises dramatically from @xmath197  k to almost @xmath198  k before starting to decline . at early times",
    "there seems to be no x - ray emission , and then it is detected only to probably fade again",
    ".    clearly continued photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of this system is necessary .",
    "combining a shock from an explosive transient with a dense stellar wind has the prospect of explaining some of the peculiarities , but such shocks have to eventually emerge at low optical depths which should dramatically change the spectroscopic and x - ray properties as the transient evolves .",
