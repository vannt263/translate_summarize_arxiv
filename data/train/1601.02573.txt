    "then , it is well known that this inverse problem has a unique solution .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , the authors prove uniqueness in the case of the steady - state and evolutionary stokes system using unique continuation property of solutions . by uniqueness",
    "we mean the following fact : if @xmath21 and @xmath22 are two solutions of corresponding to a given boundary data @xmath23 , for obstacles @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , and @xmath26 on an open subset @xmath27 , then @xmath28 .",

    "we would like to mention that there hold @xmath30 type stability estimates for the hausdorff distance between the boundaries of two cavities in terms of boundary data , also in the case of conducting cavities and elastic cavities ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these very weak stability estimates reveal that the problem is severly ill posed limiting the possibility of efficient reconstruction of the unknown object and motivating mathematically , but also from the point of view of applications , the importance of the identification of partial information on the unknown obstacle @xmath0 like , for example , the size .    in literature we can find several results concerning the determination of inclusions or cavities and the estimate of their sizes related to different kind of models . without being exhaustive , we quote some of them .",

    "the authors prove uniqueness , stability and reconstruction of an immersed obstacle in a system modeled by a linear wave equation .",
    "these results are obtained applying the unique continuation property for the wave equation and in the two dimensional case the inverse problem is transformed in a well - posed problem for a suitable cost functional .",

    "we refer to @xcite , and references therein , for more details on interior estimates for elliptic operators .    as the boundary data @xmath23 satisfies @xmath148 , we use the classical poincar inequality and obtain @xmath271 therefore , by means of the inequality @xmath272 , we deduce @xmath273 now , concerning the second integral in we note that from the trace theorem it follows @xmath274 and applying theorem [ tsr ] we obtain the inequality @xmath275 therefore , it holds @xmath276 where @xmath83 depends on @xmath277 and q. this completes the proof .",

    "in this section we will perform some numerical experiments to compute @xmath278 for classes of cavities for which our result holds . in particular , we expect to collect numerical evidence that the ratio between @xmath279 and @xmath278 is bounded from below and above by two constants indicating that , due to the limits of our technique , the estimate from below is not optimal .",
    "indeed , the numerical experiments we perform give some preliminary indications that this conjecture is true .      a more systematic analysis would require the knowledge of explicit solutions @xmath6 and @xmath188 .",
    "this would allow to compute analytically the constants in the upper and lower bounds , at least for some particular geometries .",
    "on the contrary to the case in @xcite , for the stokes system it is difficult to find explicit solutions .    for the experiments we use the free software _",

    "in particular , we consider a circle inclusion with volume @xmath286 , @xmath287 and @xmath288 with respect to @xmath289 .",
    "we have placed these circles in eight different positions , see figure @xmath290 .",

    "it is interesting to study the relationship between @xmath295 and @xmath278 .",
    "as we expected from the theory , the points @xmath296 are confined inside an angular sector delimited by two straight lines .",
    "however , it is quite clear that when @xmath95 decreases , then the lower bound becomes worse .",
    "to illustrate this situation , we simulate also the case when the distance is @xmath297 , see figure @xmath298 .      as a second class of experiments",
    ", we consider what happens when the size of the circle increases . in this case",
    "we can observe that the number @xmath278 grows rapidly when the volume occupies almost the entire domain .",
    "the result is collected in figure @xmath299 .",
    "again it is observed the relationship between the volume of the object with the quotient @xmath300 .",
    "this gives us an indication that the estimates found in theorems [ teo1 ] and [ teo2 ] involve constants that do not depend on the inclusion .",
    "an other interesting issue would be to weaken the a - priori assumptions imposed on the obstacle , as for example the fatness condition ( see , for instance , @xcite , where this restriction is removed in the case of the shallow shell equations ) .",
