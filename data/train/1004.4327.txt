    "molecular motors are nano - devices which perform mechanical work by converting part of the input energy ; for the motors of our interest in this paper , the input is derived from the hydrolysis of atp molecules @xcite . in reality , these motors are also enzymes that hydrolyze atp and utilize the input chemical energy to perform mechanical work . in this paper",
    "we specifically consider the members of a particular superfamily of motors , called kinesin , which are involved in intracellular transport processes in living cells .",
    "this family is designated as kif1a and the members of this family move along filamentous tracks called microtubule ( mt ) @xcite .",
    "one unique feature of a kif1a is that , at least under the conditions of _ in - vitro _ experiments , it functions as a single - headed motor .",
    "the average properties , e.g. , the average velocity , of these motors have been calculated analytically by using a theoretical model developed by nishinari , okada , schadschneider and chowdhury ( from now onwards , referred to as the nosc model ) @xcite which is an extension of the general approach pioneered by fisher and kolomeisky @xcite .    in single molecule experiments , individual motor proteins are observed to move in an alternating sequence of pause and translocation .",
    "the sum of the pause at a binding site and the subsequent translocation can be defined as the corresponding `` dwell time '' . because of the intrinsic irreversibility of mechano - chemical kinetics of the system , the inverse of the mean dwell time is the average velocity of a motor .",
    "the dwell time distribution @xmath3 contains more detailed information on the stochastic kinetics of a motor than that revealed its average velocity .",
    "for example , the randomness parameter @xmath4 provides an estimate of the lower bound on the number of rate - limiting kinetic steps in each cycle of the motor @xcite . for some other motors , which move on nucleic acid strand ,",
    "the analytical forms of the distributions of the dwell times have been reported recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the exact analytical expression for the distribution of the dwell times of a kif1a motor in the nosc model during a single processive run in between its attachment to the track and the next detachment .",
    "what makes the calculation more difficult in the case of kif1a , compared to those of those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , is the occurrence of branched pathways in its mechano - chemical cycle . for motors which can step both forward and backward",
    ", one can define conditional dwell times which may be more easily extracted from the data obtained from single molecule experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we also report analytical expressions for the probability densities of these conditional dwell times as well as that of a few other closely related random variables .",
    "label the equispaced sites for the binding of the motor to its track .",
    "the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to the `` chemical '' states in which the motor is bound strongly and weakly , respectively , to the microtubule track .",
    "the allowed transitions are shown by the arrows along with the corresponding rate constants ( transition probability per unit time ) . ]",
    "a mt track of the motor is modelled as a one - dimensional finite lattice having @xmath7 number of discrete sites .",
    "each site corresponds to a kif1a binding site on the mt and the lattice spacing is the separation between the successive binding sites on a mt .",
    "a kif1a motor is represented by a particle with two possible chemical states labeled by the indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to the strongly bound and weakly bound states , respectively . fig .",
    "[ fig - modelb ] illustrates the detailed mechano - chemical cycle of kif1a .",
    "the transitions @xmath8 are purely chemical whereas the transitions @xmath9 , which correspond to the brownian motion , are purely mechanical . in contrast , the transition @xmath10 is mechano - chemical ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed description ) .",
    "we define @xmath11 and @xmath12 as the probabilities of finding kif1a in state @xmath5 and state @xmath6 respectively , at site @xmath13 at time @xmath14 .",
    "the master equations for these probabilities are @xmath15 @xmath16 with @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 $ ] is the concentration of atp .",
    "now we introduce fourier transforms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and the lattice spacing , @xmath22 .",
    "thus , @xmath23 =   m(q ) \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } { \\bar s}(q , t ) \\\\ { \\bar w}(q , t )",
    "\\end{array } \\right ] \\label{eq - matrix}\\ ] ] where the transition matrix @xmath24 is given by , @xmath25 the laplace transforms of the fourier transforms of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , using @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the two components of a vector @xmath32 , the matrix equation ( [ eq - matrix ] ) can now be written in a more compact notation as @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a vector whose elements are determined by the initial conditions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an arbitrarily selected site .",
    "the dwell time at the site @xmath39 is the total duration for which the motor stays at that site , starting from the initial condition mentioned above , irrespective of the chemical state , before its next departure from the same site .",
    "thus the determinant of @xmath40 is a @xmath6nd order polynomial in @xmath41 ; that is @xcite , @xmath42 where , @xmath43 @xmath44 note that @xmath45 is the determinant of the transition matrix @xmath46 . because of conservation of probability , in the @xmath47 limit , all of the columns of @xmath48 sum to zero",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath49 .",
    "we define @xcite the position probability density @xmath50 , and hence @xmath51      following ref.@xcite , the average velocity @xmath52 of kif1a and the diffusion constant @xmath53 are found to be @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the first and second derivatives , respectively , of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath58 evaluated at @xmath59 while @xmath60 is the coefficient of @xmath61 at @xmath59 ; in this case @xmath62 .",
    "interestingly , the velocity @xmath52 depends only on the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 , of the lowest two orders of the polynomial obtained from the determinant of @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath53 depends on the three lowest order coefficients @xmath65 , @xmath64 , and @xmath63 of the determinant of @xmath40 .    ) for few different values of @xmath66 . ]",
    "we define the individual forward and backward branching probabilities as @xmath67 and @xmath68 and the corresponding dwell time distributions are @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath70 @xmath71 and , @xmath72 we define the fourier weights @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the forward and backward steps , respectively ( step size @xmath22 in our units ) . hence @xcite , @xmath75 where @xmath76 and the symbol @xmath77 expresses the condition that the fourier weight for all possible steps , except @xmath78 is zero ; in our case , @xmath78 can represent either the forward ( @xmath79 ) or the backward ( @xmath80 ) steps . for forward branching we",
    "obtain , @xmath81 where @xmath82    thus , @xmath83 inverse laplace transform yields , @xmath84 where , @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 similarly , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - a0 ] ) and @xmath92    @xmath93    inverse laplace transform yields , @xmath94 now total dwell time distribution can be written as follows : @xmath95 the total dwell distribution is plotted in the fig .",
    "[ fig - dwellwbwfkifs ] .",
    "we observe that with the increase of @xmath66 the most probable of dwell time shifts towards a smaller value .",
    "this is because rate constant @xmath66 is related to diffusion of kif1a in state @xmath6 . for smaller values of @xmath66",
    "dwell time is dominated by the rate @xmath96 , but with the increase of rate @xmath66 the dwell time depends on both @xmath66 and @xmath96 and eventually the mean dwell time decreases .",
    "a typical trajectory of a kif1a motor consists of a random sequence of forward and backward steps .",
    "therefore , we can define four different _ conditional dwell times _ @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath97 is the dwell time in between two consecutive forward steps whereas @xmath98 is the dwell time in between two consecutive backward steps .",
    "similarly , @xmath99 is the dwell time in between two consecutive steps of which the first is forward and the second is backward whereas the opposite if true in case of @xmath100 .",
    "we denote the probability density functions for the conditional dwell times by the symbols @xmath101 .",
    "the integrated probabilities obtained from these probability densities are given by @xmath102 obviously , @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , we introduce the `` pairwise splitting '' probabilities @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 represent the probability that a forward step is followed by a forward step or a backward step , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath107 and @xmath108 denote the probability that a backward step is followed by a forward step or a backward step , respectively . for the analysis of the experimental data and comparison with theoretical predictions , it is sometimes more convenient to divide the dwell times into two groups depending on the _ direction of the following step_. we use the symbols @xmath109 and @xmath110 to denote the probability density functions for the dwell times before a forward @xmath111 and a backward @xmath112 steps , respectively .",

    ", immediately after a forward step the kif1a motor can be found in either of the two states ( @xmath115 i.e. strongly bound state , and @xmath116 i.e. weakly bound state ) whereas it can exist only in state @xmath6 immediately after a backward step . the first escape problem for our model is governed by a reduced master equation ( as described in refs . @xcite and @xcite ) , with the transition matrix @xmath117    the eigen values of @xmath118 are @xmath119 where , @xmath120 and define @xmath121 .",
    "the initial conditions , describing the distribution of states just after a @xmath122 ( forward and backward ) step , are given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 as described above .",
    "using the expressions for the probability currents associated with the allowed transitions in our model , we get @xmath127    following lindn and wallin @xcite , by using the ansatz @xmath128 together with eqs .",
