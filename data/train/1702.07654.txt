    "over the last decade , an increasing amount of attention has been devoted to the interplay of thermodynamics , quantum mechanics and information theory @xcite . while most of the work is driven by fundamental questions regarding the validity of statistical mechanics in the quantum realm",
    ", recent technological advances have made it possible to actually fabricate and study thermal machines on the level of single - atoms .",
    "a prominent question is whether the ability to coherently control quantum systems allows one to construct engines that surpass the performance of their classical thermodynamic counterparts .",
    "there have been a number of approaches to this question , for example in @xcite it is shown that coherence itself can serve as a fuel such that work can be extracted from a single bath . in @xcite , the authors account for temporal nonclassical correlations and how these are affected by measurements of total energy .",
    "these type of questions are by no means new and was already at the hart of maxwell s famous demon experiment .",
    "since landauer , it is well understood that any form of information should be considered as a thermodynamic resource . in that respect , it is the information about time @xcite , that allows one to use coherence or out - of - equibrium baths as resource .",
    "here we consider a related but somewhat simpler problem , that does not involve time as the source of information .",
    "imagine we have a system in equilibrium but in a non - thermal distribution .",
    "in particular , our system of interest will be an integrable quantum system , meaning it is non - ergodic due to an extensive number of conserved quantities .",
    "we will investigate how to use these conserved quantities as a resource to extract work from these systems .",
    "the crucial point is that due to the additional conservation laws , the steady state of the system has an entropy that is lower than the gibbs entropy .",
    "consequently , it should be possible to reduce the energy by an isentropic process , that brings the state to a lower energy gibbs state .",
    "in general , the linear structure of quantum mechanics makes all projections on eigenstates conserved , as opposed to classical ensembles where only the energy and particle number are conserved @xcite .",
    "it is thus far from trivial that in many cases , most of these conserved quantities are not relevant . a way to reconcile ergodic thermodynamics with this quantum picture",
    "is provided by the _ eigenstate thermalization hypothesis(eth ) _ @xcite . in non - integrable systems",
    "the diagonal entropy usually becomes the gibbs entropy .",
    "that means that without knowledge of the phase of the state , i.e. without coherence , one can not extract work from these systems .",
    "this does not imply , though , that conserved quantities are never important .",
    "when they are , the system is called _ integrable _ and it does not thermalize . as a more refined statistical description of such integrable quantum systems ,",
    "one replaces the usual boltzmann - gibbs ensemble by a _ generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) _ of the form @xmath1 where each @xmath2 is a lagrange multiplier that fixes the expectation value of @xmath3 .",
    "this gge , as introduced by jaynes @xcite , is readily optained by constrained maximization of the von neumann - entropy . in this context",
    ", it was first adopted by rigol et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of integrability is that the entropy does not reach its maximal value at late times .",
    "the gge has an entropy that is smaller than or equal to the boltzmann - gibbs entropy , where the equality is reached only when all lagrange multipliers , apart from the inverse temperature @xmath4 are zero .",
    "consequently , a gge always has more free energy than a gibbs state with the same entropy .",
    "this immediately raises the question of whether this energy can be extracted to perform work .",
    "the answer is most certainly yes if one allows general isentropic manipulations .",
    "coupling the system to an environment might however destroy the integrability of the system and we therefore restrict our analyses to unitary manipulations .    for completeness , we mention that in addition to integrability , thermalization can also be suppressed because of particular interference called many - body localization @xcite , although the typical context in which the latter typically emerges differs from our set - up where we will work with momentum states .    while all unitary processes are isotropic , not all isentropic operators are unitary .",
    "apart from conserving the entropy , unitary operations conserve the full spectrum of the density matrix . as shown in @xcite",
    ", it is always optimal in terms of work extraction to end in a state with no coherence .",
    "consequently the work is maximized by organizing the occupations in descending order in terms of energy , i.e. the state becomes passive .",
    "note that this can always be achieved by succesive permutations of the occupation numbers .    in the @xmath5 description of an integrable quantum system ,",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath2 must be permutated to extract the maximal amount of work in such a way that they obtain the same ordering as the energy levels , corresponding to an inverse ordering of the occupation numbers .",
    "general considerations of work extraction from gge states are also given in @xcite ; work extraction from a resource - theoretical point of view has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as will be outlined in more detail below , our physical system of choice is a fermionic chain which is a commonly studied object in the context of integrability @xcite .",
    "it can be mapped onto a chain of hard - core bosons by a jordan - wigner transformation . a possible experimental realization",
    "are cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice .",
    "we will demonstrate that the proper unitary operations to perform a permutation of the lagrange multipliers of this system can be attained by using a bragg - hamiltonian .",
    "bragg - spectroscopy @xcite is commonly used to probe the structure of cold atom systems , for example in the context of the mott - insulator to superfluid phase transition @xcite .",
    "in essence , from interfering lasers an optical potential is created in the form of a travelling wave .",
    "this potential then exchanges an amount of momentum @xmath6 and energy @xmath7 with the system .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] the setup of the system is given and we explain how we will describe work extraction from it .",
    "[ sec : results ] contains results regarding extracted work and entropy production as a function of the speed at which the operations take place .",
    "additionaly , some effective temperatures relevant to the extraction are introduced and studied . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] concludes this work .",
    "we construct initial gge states to extract work from using a quantum quench described in appendix [ ap : quench ] .",
    "while the main body focuses on a system obeying a quadratic dispersion relation , appendix [ ap : tb ] compares this with a tight - binding situation where , due to the particular shape of the dispersion relation , some additional peculiarities come into play .",
    "we consider a 1d lattice of spinless fermions ( fermionic chain ) with length @xmath8 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "two seperate dispersion relations are studied :    * a free fermion gas with @xmath9 * a tight - binding model ( see appendix [ ap : tb ] ) @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the fermionic annihilation ( creation ) operators in real space at site @xmath12 , an integer as we set the lattice distance @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 are the annihilation ( creation ) operators in momentum space , with @xmath15 for some integer @xmath16 . as opposed to position , momentum is a conserved quantity , so that @xmath17 will be our label of preference for the states , with an energy denoted @xmath18 . in the following ,",
    "units are chosen such that @xmath19 .    treating the occupation of each @xmath17-state as an independently conserved quantity",
    ", the gge has the form @xmath20 where each lagrange multiplier @xmath21 fixes the expectation value @xmath22 .",
    "this gge - ensemble , being the tensor product of the two - by - two density matrices of each state , holds an entropy which is the sum of the von neumann - entropies of all states , namely @xmath23.\\ ] ]    note that the gge - ensemble description amounts to an effective fermi - dirac distribution for each @xmath17-mode , that is @xmath24 where @xmath21 can be thought of as having the form @xmath25 we have the freedom to set the chemical potential @xmath26 , a constant independent of @xmath17 , which will be set in section [ subsec : temperatures ] .",
    "@xmath27 then corresponds to the effective temperature of mode @xmath17 .      in order to perform the permutations of the single - particle occupations , we suggest to add bragg - pulses to the system @xcite , which are described by the additional time - dependent hamitonian : @xmath28\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the heisenberg equations - of - motion for the annihilation operators with hamiltonian @xmath29 read @xmath30 in order to eliminate the explicit time - dependence on the right - hand side of",
    ", we move to the rotating frame @xmath31 , leaving a matrix equation @xmath32 that can be solved by diagonalization of @xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to a number of simultateous rabi - oscillations .",
    "for a two level problem , the calculation can be done explicitly .",
    "it follows that 1 ) a resonant swap of occupation is done in a time @xmath34 and 2 ) the larger @xmath35 , the better the selectivity of a single transition , i.e. minimal side effects on other energy levels . from this",
    "we deduce that most work can be extracted in the adiabatic limit .    in order to solve the coupled equations present at each operation",
    ", we neglect the off - diagonal elements in @xmath36 .",
    "this allows for writing the time - dependence of the ensemble as @xmath37 thus bringing the time dependence to the lagrange multipliers .",
    "this corresponds to letting the system equilibrate between successive rabi pulses .    in the case of a quadratic dispersion , a finite cutoff in k - space",
    "is taken , that is sufficiently larger than the fermi wave vector , so that the procedure outlined above holds . in the tight - binding case on the other hand ,",
    "two new complications arise : periodicity and coinciding resonances .",
    "this tight - binding case is discussed further in appendix [ ap : tb ] .",
    "as the systems considered in this work have an extensive number of levels , more than one transposition needs to take place to extract a maximal amount of work . in order to find the required transpositions , we use the property of permutations that @xcite 1 ) they can be decomposed in cycles and 2 ) each of these cycles of length @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 successive transpositions .",
    "the latter is non - unique , so we will compare two different protocols in this work , depicted in figure [ fig : protocollen ] .    as an example , we apply our method to an initial non - thermal state created by a quench that constitutes instantly switching off an additional optical lattice potential . for details on this initial state , see [ sec :",
    "starting from the initial state after a quench , described in [ sec : quench ] , we examine the work that can be extracted by our bragg procedure for both protocols .",
    "we define the _ maximal extractable work _ @xmath40 as the work that a perfect permutation of the lagrange multipliers would allow to extract , as described in the introduction .",
    "the _ extracted work _",
    "@xmath41 on the other hand , corresponds to the work extracted with finite @xmath35 using one of our bragg protocols .",
    "the _ unextracted work _ then is the difference between the _ maximal extractable work _ and the _ extracted work _ @xmath42 . the _ entropy production _ @xmath43 is the difference between the final and initial entropy of the state , where the entropy functional is given by .",
    "work extraction for both protocols is studied as a function of @xmath35 ( corresponding to adiabaticity , it is worth stressing the graphs do not correspond to a single proces as function of time ) .",
    "the results are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : kwadwork ] from which it is evident that both unextracted work and entropy production decay quadratically with @xmath35 .",
    "one sees that our considered protocol 1 turns out to be more efficient than protocol 2 as it needs a smaller @xmath35 to extract the same amount of work compared to protocol 2 . as predicted , in the adiabatic limit all work can be extracted .",
    "furthermore , both the unextracted work and the entropy production decay algebraically like @xmath44 .    . a @xmath44 line ( red , dashed ) is shown for comparison . ]",
    "it is worth noticing that for short @xmath35 a negative amount of total work @xmath45 is extracted .",
    "this is to be expected if there are more states of total energy higher than the initial state available in the system than there are states with lower total energy than the initial state . for short @xmath35 ,",
    "the bragg operation is rather inprecise and produces a considerable amount of entropy , corresponding to a high amount of randomness .",
    "the more states of higher energy are available then , the more probable that the state arrives there by chance .",
    "this quadratic decay can be understood analytically .",
    "because the values of both unextracted work and entropy are small , we assume them to be linear in the number of unwanted transpositions . generalizing the expression for one rabi - oscillation to a superposition of all simultaneous oscillations , the sum of all swapped elements",
    "can be written as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 denotes the number of particles in state @xmath17 before the operation .",
    "approximate @xmath48 independent of @xmath17 , so that this number can be brought out of the summand .",
    "using @xmath49 , expression can be bounded by    @xmath50    now suppose the purpose of the operation is transposing the states @xmath51 en @xmath52 , such that parameters @xmath53 must be chosen ( note that in this paragraph different units are chosen such that the integer @xmath17-modes are allowed , but this wo nt be crucial since we only work up to a proportionality constant here ) .",
    "the total of all unwanted contributions is proportional to    @xmath54\\label{eq : ontwikkeling},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is quadratically increasing in @xmath55 in leading order , or equivalently quadratically decaying in @xmath34 .",
    "if , instead of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , one wishes to transpose another pair of states the results remain valid as we show in the following .",
    "the difference between the energy levels @xmath56 and @xmath18 is @xmath57 and for the rotated states @xmath58    @xmath59 is chosen such that the pair of levels @xmath60 en @xmath61 becomes resonant , from which    @xmath62    substituting in then yields @xmath63 which is only linearly dependent of @xmath64 . as a consequence , chosing @xmath65 merely shifts the terms in the summation . from , it is also readily seen that operations where @xmath66 will correspond to a rescaled version of . from this , it is apparent that the imperfections of the whole procedure , consisting of a number of successive operations where each time the imperfections decay quadratically with @xmath35 , will also be decaying quadratically in @xmath35 .",
    "the linearisation of the work- and entropy functionals then provides the observed behaviour .",
    "commonly , the notion of temperature refers to equilibrium states , as if they can exchange energy with some reservoir .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to generalize the concept of temperature ouside this scope . in particular , we define three different temperatures for our gge - state : the boltzman - gibbs temperature @xmath67 , the mode - average temperature @xmath68 and the extraction temperature @xmath69 .",
    "the boltzman - gibbs temperature @xmath67 is simply the equilibrium temperature that a boltzmann - gibbs state ( fermi - dirac distribution of k - modes ) would have if this equilibrium state has the same total energy @xmath70 and particle number @xmath71 as the gge - state .",
    "it hence satisfies @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the chemical potential . in the tight - binding case , @xmath74 due to symmetry reasons but",
    "not so in the quadratic case . note that the total particle number is @xmath75 as there are @xmath8 k - modes and half - filling ( both quenching and bragg pulses are number - conserving ) .",
    "secondly , we define @xmath76 to be the average of the temperatures of the individual @xmath17-modes @xmath77 where each @xmath27 is calculated from . for @xmath73 , the boltzmann - gibbs value mentioned above",
    "is taken here .    for our final notion of temperature , we start from the thermodynamic relationship that it is the derivative of energy with respect to entropy . in our case",
    "however there is no unique correspondence between these two quantities as the configuration space is l - dimensional ( or , keeping the particle number constant , an l-1 dimensional hypersurface embedded in the mentioned space ) , so that the temperature is dependent on direction along which a variation occurs @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , we consider this temperature for the final state with parameters @xmath79 and where the variations correspond to a change in @xmath35 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath80 we are particularly interested in the behaviour for @xmath35 sufficient so that the finite time - protocol can be regarded as resulting in a small perturbation @xmath81 from the adiabatic result @xmath82    these three different notions of temperature are shown on figure [ fig : kwadtemperatures ] for the quadratic dispersion and figure [ fig : tbtemperatures ] for the tight - binding dispersion .",
    "@xmath69 is the most protocol - dependent as it depends on the small difference between the attained state and the perfect state rather than the attained state as a whole .",
    "also some oscillatory behaviour is present , which might diminish for larger system size . for @xmath68 and @xmath83 on the other hand , it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish both protocols . due to the fundamentally different nature of the three temperatures ,",
    "it is remarkable that they differ less than a factor two .",
    "in this work , we demonstrated how work can be extracted from an integrable quantum system described by a gge , using fermionic chains as an example .",
    "the work extraction is done by permuting the lagrange multipliers and we provide a method to construct the necessary unitary operations from bragg spectroscopy , that can be implemented with ultracold atomic gases .",
    "our method was explicitly demonstrated for two seperate dispersion relations : a free gas and a tight - binding lattice . in both cases",
    ", we started from an initial stationary state constructed by a quenching procedure .    in the case of a free gas ,",
    "all possible work becomes extracted in the adiabatic limit .",
    "when performing the operations with finite speed , the decay of the unextracted work and of the entropy production decay quadratically with @xmath35 , the slowness of the operations .    in the case of a tight - binding lattice , a naive approach would leave a certain amount of unextracted work .",
    "still , this can be overcome by minor adjustments , such as using shifted basis states or by including a next - nearest neighbour hopping term in the hamiltonian . with these modifications , also all work is extracted in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the two protocols we compared produce similar results in most cases .",
    "there are cases however , where an extensive difference between the two protocols is evident , for example when significant next - nearest - neighbour hopping is present .",
    "other protocols may be constructed as well ( or using a different starting point for the transpositions within the same protocol ) and it will be worthwile to verify the efficiency of a protocol before implementing it in practice .    when considering efficient computation , umklapp processes are problematic and were consequently neglected",
    ". we could exploit the freedom however to choose a brillouin zone in such a way that these umklapp processes were of minimal importance .",
    "we chose to put the edges of the brillouin zone ( the cut of k - space ) through the transitions that were the least coupled with the resonant transition .",
    "this is , generally , not the same als the transition which is most out - of - resonance which would be another meaningful choice of this cut .    note that through the bragg hamiltonian the optical potential is treated as a classical field .",
    "this means that photonic uncertainty and entanglement between the system and the environment ( as entanglement within the system ) are not incorporated in the picture used .",
    "we expect the influence of these principles to our results to be rather limited @xcite , but nonetheless it may be interesting to look how they change the picture precisely .    from the unextracted work and the entropy production , we can define an effective temperature , which is of the order of the boltzmann - gibbs temperature of the system .",
    "the methods are also applicable to bosonic systems that can be mapped to a fermionic one by a jordan - wigner transform . on the other hand",
    ", the fermionic particles could also have a spin , in which case the polarization of the bragg laser would distinguish the spin components .",
    "our method can be extended to higher - dimensional systems as well and can be applied to generic band structures .",
    "when multiple states with the same @xmath17-value are present , they can be distinguished by proper setting of the frequency @xmath7 .     for the quadratic dispersion .",
    "dotted lines : @xmath69 , dashed lines : @xmath67 and full lines : @xmath68 .",
    "the blue lines correspond to protocol 1 and the orange ones to protocol 2 . ]",
    "we acknowledge discussion with j. naudts . this work was financially supported by the fwo odysseus program .",
    "d.s . acknowledges support of the fwo as post - doctoral fellow of the research foundation - flanders .",
    "[ sec : quench ]    in quantum mechanics , time - evolution is described by a unitary operation . on the other hand , changes of basis are also unitary transformations .",
    "the interplay of these two unitary operations can give rise to a number of different manifestations when both are present .",
    "in the case of adiabatic time - evolution , both operations coincide such that the density matrix after evolution expressed in the new basis has the same elements as the density matrix before the transformation , expressed in the old basis .",
    "the opposite limit , quenching , takes place when de hamiltonian is changed instantly@xcite .",
    "generally , the system is no longer in an eigenstate after this quench .",
    "however , as we only consider the occupations as conserved quantities and neglect the oscillating off - diagonal elements ( decoherence which corresponds to time - averaging ) , the resulting density matrix becomes diagonal again , be it with different elements ( eigenvalues ) .",
    "if one starts from a thermal state , the ordering of occupations is opposite to the ordering of the energy levels , as the boltzmann - distribution is a decreasing function .",
    "after quenching , this order is generally no longer maintained .",
    "because of this , quenching can be useful to construct a non - thermal stationary state from which work can be extracted .",
    "in particular , we perform a quench consisting of switching off an additional term in the hamiltonian of the form @xmath84 corresponding to an additional potential with period @xmath85 which is commensurable with @xmath8 . for the tight - binding case where periodicity has to be taken into account , the sums in @xmath17-labels are considered modulo @xmath86 .",
    "we rather consider the switching off than the switching on of the periodic potential in order to have the simpler final hamiltonian .",
    "the state after the quench is then used as an initial state to extract work from . as particle distribution before the quench a zero - temperature fermi - dirac distribution at half filling is taken . in the main body of the text , a quench with @xmath87 and @xmath88 is used .",
    "the distributions of particles as function of the energy are shown on figure [ fig : distributions ] .",
    "left : quadratic dispersion and right : ( @xmath89-shifted ) tight - binding dispersion .",
    "as the quadratic dispersion relation is symmetric , each dot corresponds to two opposite k - modes . ]",
    "in the tight - binding case , some care must be taken .",
    "because of the periodicity in momentum space , in the matrix @xmath33 from equation an additional pair of nonvanishing ( non - main ) diagonals appear that correspond to the umklapp processes that cross the boundary of the brillouin zone .",
    "contrary to the direct processes , the umklapp matrix elements do not become time - independent under the transformation to rotating basis states . in order to still be able to perform an efficient computation where only diagonalization must be done numerically",
    ", we will therefore neglect these umklapp - processes .",
    "however , for each bragg operation we choose a new brillouin zone , with a cut in k - space chosen such that the processes neglected are the transitions that are the least coupled with the resonant transition .",
    "a second issue with the tight - binding dispersion is that the naive choice of basis states for @xmath17 as done above leads to multiple resonances that coincide .",
    "namely , for certain values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 more than one pair of levels is at resonance , making it impossible to affect them independently .",
    "we propose two distinct solutions for this latter issue .",
    "the first possible solution is to use basis states that are slightly shifted in k - space , which corresponds to the presence of a gauge field@xcite .",
    "an alternative solution is to introduce an additional term in the fermionic hamiltonian , such as a next - nearest - neighbour hopping .",
    "both solutions break the degeneracy of the bragg transitions .",
    "results for @xmath90 and @xmath43 are shown as function of @xmath35 on figure [ fig : tbwork ] . from ( a),(b ) it is seen that for the naive choice of basis states @xmath91 the extracted work does not approach the maximal extractable work in the adiabatic limit even though the entropy production tends to zero .",
    "this suggest a permutation of the lagrange multipliers is performed which is not the optimal one , confirming the issue of coinciding resonances .",
    "indeed , on ( c ) , ( d ) it is shown that the addition of a small gauge field that slightly shifts the dispersion allows to extract all of the maximal extractable work .",
    "similarly , also adding a small nnn - hopping perturbation to the hamiltonian results in a full extraction of the available work .",
    "the behaviour in these two cases can be attributed to the possibility of distinguishing the transition resonances as discussed above .",
    "galilei - shifted basis states ( bottom ) . results where the dispersion includes a @xmath92 next - nearest - neighbour hopping term are numerically similar to the bottom case .",
    "perturbing parameters for the latter two cases are chosen small to make comparison with the unperturbed case meaningful .",
    "clearly , the maximal available amount of work @xmath93 is reached in the adiabatic limit in the bottom case but not in the unperturbed one .",
    "again protocol 1 is depicted in blue and protocol 2 in orange . ]",
    "in contrast to the case of the quadratic dispersion , there is no simple analytical expression that describes the decay as function of @xmath35 .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that the energy states are on average closer to each other here , making the number of significant off - diagonal processes larger and resulting in a decay that is slower than in the case of the quadratic dispersion . for both protocols nevertheless the unextracted work and the entropy production decay to zero in a similar way .",
    "as opposed to the case of the quadratic dispersion , protocol 2 seems more efficient on average although the difference between the two protocols remains modest .",
    "this is not always the case though , as is seen on figure [ fig : largesigma ] .",
    "when there is a next - nearest - neighbour hopping term @xmath94 present for example , there is a significant difference in efficiency between both protocols .",
