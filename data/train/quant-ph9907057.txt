    "in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics an abstract concept of physical observable is formulated in terms of real eigenvalues and sharp probability distributions , which leads to the well known correspondence between observables and self - adjoint operators on the hilbert space @xcite . a natural extension of this formulation",
