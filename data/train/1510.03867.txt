    "the relative abundances of the nuclides that were made just minutes after the big bang currently provide our most reliable probe of the physics and the content of the very early universe .",
    "the most well - studied of these primordial element abundances include the deuterium abundance ( d / h ) , the primordial @xmath5he mass fraction ( y@xmath6 ) , and the @xmath7li abundance ( @xmath7li / h ) .",
    "if the standard model of cosmology and particle physics provides an accurate description of the universe throughout big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the primordial element abundances depend only on the number density ratio of baryons to photons ( @xmath8 in dimensionless units of @xmath9 ) .",
    "if the ratio of baryons - to - photons is unchanged from bbn to recombination , then bbn is a parameter - free theory provided that @xmath10 can be measured with sufficient precision from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . using the results from the recent cmb analysis by the @xcite ,",
    "the primordial element abundances for the standard model are predicted to have the values : log(d / h)@xmath11 , y@xmath12 , and a(@xmath7li)@xmath13 at 68 per cent confidence @xcite .",
    "these predictions confirm the well - known ` lithium problem ' ( for a review , see @xcite ) ; the standard model @xmath7li abundance now constitutes a @xmath14 deviation from the best observational determination , a(@xmath7li)@xmath15 , derived from the atmospheres of metal - poor stars in the halo of the milky way @xcite . at present , it is still unclear if new physics beyond the current standard model is required during bbn to explain this discrepancy , or if some @xmath7li is destroyed during the lives of metal - poor stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the lithium problem , there appears to be a ` helium problem ' .",
    "specifically , the primordial @xmath5he mass fraction estimated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* y@xmath16 ) , deviates from the standard model expectation at a level of @xmath17 .",
    "however , using a similar dataset and a different analysis strategy , @xcite report y@xmath18 , which is in agreeement with the standard model value .",
    "the discrepancy between these two recent studies could be attributable to the different sample selection cuts applied by these authors and/or systematics that are presently unaccounted for ( e.g. an incomplete modelling of the emission line spectrum of the studied ii  regions ) .",
    "the primordial deuterium abundance reported recently by @xcite and @xcite is in good agreement with the standard model expectation .",
    "the best environments to measure the primordial d / h abundance are the most metal - poor damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) that are seen in absorption along the line - of - sight to a more distant background quasar .",
    "highly precise measurements of the d / h abundance in these systems are made possible by : ( 1 ) the simple and quiescent kinematic structure of the absorbing gas ; ( 2 ) the lorentzian damped ly@xmath0  absorption wings , which depend sensitively on the total column density of neutral hydrogen ; and ( 3 ) the host of weak , high - order lyman series absorption lines of neutral deuterium , whose equivalent widths are directly proportional to the total column density of neutral deuterium .",
    "the deuterium abundance then follows by simultaneously fitting the relative strengths of the high order i  absorption lines and the i  lyman series lines ( including the crucial ly@xmath0  absorption feature ) . for these reasons",
    ", the measurement of d / h is arguably the most reliable primordial element abundance , since its determination is almost entirely independent of the modelling technique employed .",
    "although the modelling technique used to measure d / h is not currently limited by systematic uncertainties , there may be other effects that could potentially bias the determination of the primordial d / h abundance .",
    "for example , the work by @xcite is based on just 5 systems where the d / h abundance can be measured with high precision , and this sample must be expanded in the future to overcome the effects of small number statistics . furthermore , it is necessary to explore potential astrophysical uncertainties that could systematically bias the results or contribute to the sample dispersion .",
    "perhaps the two dominant astrophysical uncertainties that might bias a deuterium abundance measurement are : ( 1 ) the differential ionization potential of deuterium and hydrogen , @xmath19 , introduces a small systematic bias under the assumption that d / h@xmath20i / i .",
    "( 2 ) the astration of deuterium during the chemical evolution of galaxies , can systematically lower a galaxy s d / h ratio .    in this paper",
    ", we assess the deuterium ionization correction , that may introduce a bias in the determination of the primordial d / h ratio .",
    "the only published investigation of the deuterium ionization correction in the context of the primordial element abundances was conducted by @xcite , and the issue does not seem to have been investigated further since that work . under the simplifying assumption of ionization balance for deuterium in gas at @xmath21k",
    ", @xcite concluded that d / h@xmath22i / i  in mostly neutral regions ( e.g. dlas with a high i  column density ) , and d / h@xmath230.996i / i  in mostly ionized regions ( e.g. sub - dlas ) . the correction for sub - dlas could therefore be as large as 0.002  dex , which is @xmath24 of the current measurement precision .",
    "given that the current d / h measurement precision is nearing the magnitude of the ionization correction , a more detailed investigation into this potential bias over a much larger range in parameter space is warranted .",
    "in this paper , we present the results from a suite of calculations to determine the d / h ionization correction as a function of the i  column density and level of ionization . in section  [ sec : model ] , we outline the details of our photoionization simulations and compare our code to _ cloudy_. the results of our calculations are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , where we provide fitting formulae to determine the deuterium ionization correction using observable quantities .",

    "to calculate the relative ionization of deuterium and hydrogen , we have developed a software package that provides an approximate model of the gas distribution and ionization of a metal - poor dla .",

    "the necessary improvements that our code offers over _ cloudy _ include : ( 1 ) the atomic physics of the deuterium atom , which are not currently included in _ cloudy _ ; and ( 2 ) we model the gas distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium with a putative dark matter halo .",
    "we describe the details of our model calculations in the following subsections .",

    "we assume that the pressure profile of the gas comprises a thermal and a turbulent component , such that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the radial temperature profile , @xmath48 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath49 is the proton mass , @xmath50 is the mass per particle ( which has a radial dependence due to the ionization state of the gas ) , and @xmath51 is the doppler parameter of the gas . for this study , we use a typical doppler parameter of @xmath52 , as measured recently for a sample of low metallicity dlas @xcite .",

    "other properties , such as the redshift , turbulent doppler parameter , and metal abundances of the dla can be inferred from observations .",
    "we adopt typical parameter values for these quantities : @xmath125 , @xmath200 , and we globally scale the metals to 1/1000  @xmath201 , in solar relative proportions . to reduce the computational demand of these calculations , we only consider the @xcite radiation field shape at the appropriate redshift , and scale the intensity by a factor of either @xmath202 , @xmath162 , or @xmath163 . as we discuss in section  [ sec : disc ] , changing the shape of the radiation field does not effect the estimated deuterium ionization correction .",

    "as discussed in section  [ sec : nummeth ] , the first iteration of our numerical solution was initialised with a gas temperature of 20,000  k , and the gas was assumed to be mostly ionized .",
    "no dark matter halo with @xmath223 was able to host gas that would appear as a dla at @xmath224 .",
    "we then increased the virial mass of each halo by @xmath225 , using as input the final thermal and ionization structure that were output by the previous model . by initialising the simulations with the solution from the previous model ,",
    "the computational requirement was greatly reduced .",
    "we sequentially increased the dark matter halo mass until the peak @xmath2(i ) of a halo had exceeded @xmath226 .",
    "at these i  column densities , molecular h formation ( and presumably star formation ) is an important factor to consider @xcite , and is not included in our modelling procedure .",
    "our final model suite comprises all sightlines through these dark matter halos that produce an i  column density in excess of @xmath227 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ppic ] we show the results of our nfw calculations , which are qualitatively similar to the plane parallel geometry ; the d / h ionization correction is most sensitive to the column density ratio of the successive stages of metal ionization ( and to a lesser extent on the i  column density ) .",
    "however , the ionization correction in the nfw geometry also depends on the grid of parameter values ( halo mass , @xmath106 , etc . ) , which introduce an uncertainty in this correction .",
    "the n ion ratio provides the most reliable correction , accurate to within @xmath228  dex ( 6  per  cent ) for log  @xmath2(i)/@xmath229 over the entire grid of parameter space considered here .",
    "the uncertainty is considerably worse for the c and si ion ratios , which have a 30 per cent uncertainty in the correction over the entire range ( i.e. a correction uncertainty of up to @xmath230  dex when the ion ratio is near unity ) .",
    "for each of these ion ratios we provide fitting formulae for the ionization correction factors , in the form of eq .",
    "[ eqn : icpoly ] , with the @xmath158 coefficients listed in table  [ tab : nfwcoeff ] .",
    "these calculations represent the central values of the ionization correction , and should be used together with the percentage uncertainties quoted above .",
    "our calculations with both geometries suggest that deuterium is slightly underionized relative to hydrogen in metal - poor dlas . by disabling the individual physical processes in our code ,",
    "we conclude that the dominant physical process that sets the deuterium ionization correction is d  @xmath107  h charge transfer ; specifically , the negative ionization correction term is the result of the preferred ( exothermic ) charge transfer recombination reaction d@xmath231  +  h@xmath232d@xmath233  +  h@xmath231 .",
    "photoionization plays a minimal role ; thus , the most important factor to determine the deuterium ionization correction in dlas and sub - dlas is the h volume density and the gas temperature , not the incident radiation field .",
    "there are a few remarkable similarities and differences between the two geometries considered in this paper .",
    "the first major difference between the nfw and plane parallel models is the spread of ion ratios for a given i  column density ; the nfw models exhibit a very small range in the ion ratios ( typically @xmath234  dex ) , whereas the plane parallel models cover a much larger range ( at least @xmath235  dex ) .",
    "this difference is purely a geometrical effect , since the gas density profile in the nfw geometry is more limited , yet has the advantage of being more physically motivated .",
    "another difference between the two geometries is the value of the deuterium ionization correction using the c and si ion ratios .",
    "the plane parallel models underpredict the ionization correction for i  column densities @xmath236  @xmath117 , and overpredict the correction when @xmath2(i )  @xmath237  @xmath117 .",
    "the nii / ni  ion ratio , on the other hand , is nearly identical regardless of the gas geometry , and therefore offers the least geometry dependent correction .",
    "the invariance of the nii / ni  ratio with geometry or any of the parameter space that we have explored is because the charge transfer recombination reaction n@xmath231  +  h@xmath232n@xmath233  +  h@xmath231 sets the nii / ni  ratio when log@xmath2(i)/@xmath238 .",
    "therefore , @xmath2(nii)/@xmath2(ni )  @xmath239  @xmath2(ii)/@xmath2(i )  @xmath239  @xmath2(ii)/@xmath2(i ) for large i  column densities . on the other hand , when log@xmath2(i)/@xmath240 , primary photoionization drives the determination of the nii / ni  ratio .",
    "we therefore conclude that the most suitable systems for measuring the primordial deuterium abundance are those with log@xmath2(i)/@xmath241 for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the deuterium ionization correction factor is relatively small ( typically @xmath242  dex ) ; ( 2 ) if an ionization correction needs to be applied in the future , the nii / ni  ratio should depend only on charge exchange , similarly for the ii / i  ratio , and should be largely independent of the unknown physical properties of the system ( e.g. density , shape / intensity of the incident radiation field ) ; and ( 3 ) as discussed in @xcite , the lorentzian damping wings of the i  ly@xmath0  absorption line , together with the multitude of weak high order lyman series i  absorption lines , offer an determination of the @xmath2(i)/@xmath2(i ) ratio that is largely independent of the cloud model .    under the assumption that d  @xmath107  h charge transfer is the dominant process that sets the d / h ionization correction , we can combine eq .",
    "[ eqn : dctr ] and eq .",
    "[ eqn : ionbalance ] to obtain the following relation : @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the assumed primordial abundance of deuterium .",
    ".  [ eqn : dhcloudy ] can be applied in post - processing to more detailed photoionization calculations , such as _ cloudy _ , that include a much larger range of physical processes than our calculations . since nii / ni  is independent of geometry , the relationship between nii / ni  and ic(d / h ) using the _ cloudy _ photoionization software and eq .",
    "[ eqn : dhcloudy ] should offer the most reliable ionization correction .",
    "we therefore conclude that the following simple relation should be used to estimate the deuterium ionization correction factor : @xmath245 where ir  @xmath246 and , as discussed in section  [ sec : nfwmod ] , ic(d / h ) should be used with a @xmath228  dex ( i.e. 6  per  cent ) uncertainty in the ionization correction factor .",
    "although the deuterium ionization correction estimated herein does not significantly alter the current determination of the primordial deuterium abundance , it will become important to consider this systematic offset in the near - future .",
    "we propose that the nii / niratio provides the most robust ionization correction for deuterium , since it is insensitive to the various known and unknown physical properties of metal - poor dlas ( e.g. cloud geometry , halo mass , i  column density , etc . ) .",
    "unfortunately , nitrogen is notably underabundant in metal - poor dlas @xcite ; there are typically just three nitrogen atoms for every 10,000 d atoms in the most metal - poor systems .",
    "nevertheless , measuring the n ion ratio should be a goal for future high precision surveys that aim to accurately measure the primordial abundance of deuterium in the most metal - poor dlas .",
    "the @xmath2(i)/@xmath2(i ) column density ratio that is measured using quasar absorption line systems is generally assumed to be equal to the deuterium abundance ( d / h ) .",
    "we have tested this assumption by developing a software package that calculates the relative ionization of deuterium , hydrogen , and a selection of the most abundant metal ions .",
    "our computations are similar in spirit to the commonly used photoionization software _",
    "cloudy_. the main advantage of our code , aside from including the atomic data for deuterium , is that we are able to model the density , thermal , and ionization profile of gas held in hydrostatic equilibrium with an nfw dark matter potential . on the basis of our calculations , we draw the following conclusions : +  ( i ) for the simple case of a uniform density , plane parallel slab of gas with similar properties to dlas , we have confirmed that our code produces comparable results as _ cloudy _ for the ions that are used in our work .",
    "( ii ) we performed a suite of calculations using a plane parallel geometry to estimate the correction that must be applied to the measured column density ratio @xmath2(i)/@xmath2(i ) to determine the d / h abundance .",
    "this correction is most sensitive to the relative column densities of successive stages of metal ionization and , to a lesser degree , the total i  column density .",
    "( iii ) we also calculated the deuterium ionization correction for a more realistic gas density distribution , whereby a gas cloud is confined to the potential of an nfw dark matter halo irradiated by the @xcite background . for both the plane parallel and nfw geometry",
    ", we provide fitting functions to estimate the deuterium ionization correction using either the ciii / cii , nii / ni , or siiii / siii  ion ratios and the i  column density .",
    "( iv ) the relationship between the nii / ni  ion ratio and the deuterium ionization correction is remarkable .",
    "this relationship is essentially independent of all other physical properties of our model , and provides the most accurate and reliable deuterium ionization correction .",
    "the ciii / cii  and siiii / siii  ion ratios , although more observationally accessible , are more dependent on both the physical conditions and the geometry of the gas .",
    "( v ) we propose that systems with log@xmath2(i)/@xmath241 are the most suitable systems to measure the primordial d / h ratio . in this i  column density regime",
    ", charge exchange ensures that @xmath2(nii)/@xmath2(ni )  @xmath239  @xmath2(ii)/@xmath2(i )  @xmath239  @xmath2(ii)/@xmath2(i ) , allowing a reliable ionization correction factor to be determined .",
    "( vi ) our work provides the first quantitative analysis of the deuterium ionization correction in metal - poor dlas , and confirms the qualitative conclusions drawn by @xcite : the deuterium ionization correction can be safely neglected when the i / i  abundance ratio is measured in a dla that is in thermal and ionization equilibrium .",
    "the deuterium ionization correction for a typical system in the recent analysis by @xcite is likely to be @xmath247 per cent , which is well below the current measurement uncertainty ( 2 per cent ) ; the ionization correction is therefore not an important consideration at present .",
    "however , new cases of metal - poor dlas that exhibit clean i  absorption lines are being identified , and the search for such systems will be greatly expanded with the next generation of 30+m telescopes coming on line in the next decade . at that time , a reliable ionization correction factor for deuterium will be required , as the statistics of d / h measurements improve significantly beyond the current limited dataset .",
