    "in despite of the success of the standard model ( sm ) in explaining and predicting experimental data , it is widely believed that new physics has to set in at some high energy scale .",
    "one of such new physics models is the the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "various supersymmetry ( susy ) models , such as gravity - mediated and gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models @xcite , have been extensively considered in the literature to explain why the masses of the superparticles are not the same as those of the sm particles . in general , the masses of the superparticles are predicted to be around a few hundred gev or at the tev region .",
    "there are ample studies in the literature to examine the detection of these non - standard particles in the current and future experiments , including those at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and at the future linear colliders .    among the superparticles of the mssm , some models of susy breaking predict the existence of a light gluino with the masses around 1 gev or less @xcite .",
    "if this scenario is true , then there is rich phenomenology predicted for the current experimental data which can be used to either confirm or constrain models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , aleph collaboration used the data on the cross - sections of dijet production and the angular distributions in 4-jet production to derive the ratios of the color factors @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "based on the obtained values , aleph excluded the existence of the gluinos with the mass lighter than @xmath3gev at @xmath4 confidence level .",
    "the result was criticized by farrar  @xcite , who argued that aleph s analysis underestimated the theoretical uncertainties in the knowledge of hadronization and resummation of large logarithms arising in the separation of jets from soft radiation .",
    "if these uncertainties are taken into account , the light gluino is excluded only at @xmath5 level .",
    "this problem was further examined by csikor and fodor in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they determined the color factors of underlying gauge theory by studying the behavior of the ratios @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 in the region of @xmath9gev to @xmath10 scale .",
    "they concluded that the @xmath11 analysis of these quantities allows to exclude the light gluino with the mass between @xmath12 and @xmath9gev at @xmath13 confidence level , and with the mass less than @xmath14gev at @xmath15 confidence level .",
    "if their results are combined with the @xmath16-distribution from aleph analysis , the exclusion confidence level is improved to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "this conclusion is quite insensitive to the overall error of aleph s results ; for instance , the exclusion limits of the combined analysis are still above @xmath19 if aleph s systematic error is increased by a factor of 3 .",
    "however , in order to extract the number of active fermions from the experimental data , both methods @xcite and @xcite rely on the state - of - art usage of perturbative theory",
    ". none of the separate analyses can exclude the light gluino at the confidence level @xmath20 , and combined and complicated analysis is needed to overcome the flaws of each separate method .",
    "another significant limitation on the possible parameter space of the models with light gluinos was recently imposed by the negative results of the search for the production of charginos with the mass less than @xmath21 at lep2 @xcite .",
    "this result disfavors the models with the masses of all gauginos vanishing at tree level at gut scale  @xcite , in which gluino has the mass of the order gev , and at the electroweak scale at least one of the charginos is necessarily lighter than @xmath22-boson . however , the lep2 data can not rule out the models with the other spectra of gaugino masses , for instance , the models of gauge - mediated symmetry breaking where the gluino can be the only light gaugino @xcite . as mentioned before",
    ", the analysis of @xcite already puts strong constraints on the possibility of the light mass of the gluino , however , due to the aforementioned theoretical difficulties it seems that more study is needed .",
    "there are a few other methods discussed in the literature to look for light gluino . if gluino is light and hadronizes before reaching the detector , it should be possible to observe its bound states , for example , @xmath23-mesons , created by binding of gluon and gluino  @xcite .",
    "although the region of @xmath23 masses is significantly restricted by ktev measurements  @xcite , @xmath23 can still exist in the mass region @xmath24 gev  @xcite .",
    "if the squark masses are of the order of several hundreds gev , the light mass of gluino can lead to the noticeable peaks in the dijet invariant mass and angular distributions at tevatron or lhc , arising due to the resonant production of massive squarks in the quark - gluino fusion  @xcite .",
    "the already existing tevatron data allows to exclude the light gluino models with the masses of the lighter squarks lying between 150 and 650 gev  @xcite ; it would be desirable to continue the search for the resonant peaks at tevatron , as well as at lhc , where the increased dijet production cross - section would allow to cover a larger region of squark masses .    in the pqcd theory , the existence of a light gluino would change the running of the strong coupling , as well as the form of the dokshitser - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parizi ( dglap ) equations .",
    "therefore , to describe the existing dis data , it is necessary to account not only for the quark and gluon distribution functions inside the initial hadron(s ) , but also for the gluino distribution which has different renormalization group properties .",
    "an obvious question is whether the currently available hadronic data is consistent with the existence of light gluino .",
    "the last analysis of this type was done in 1994 publications  @xcite , which showed that the existence of the light gluino did nt contradict dis data available at that time .",
    "however , those analyses did not include the more recent data from h1 , zeus and nmc experimental groups  @xcite covering the region of lower @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these new data can be crucial for testing the scenario of having a light gluino in the supersymmetry models , because the existence of a light gluino would imply a slower running of the parton distribution functions from the low to high @xmath26 .",
    "the existence of new types of particle interactions can be proved if one observes the violation of the symmetries of the standard model , for instance , the significant violation of the discrete symmetry with respect to space reflections ( @xmath27-parity ) in strong interactions . experimental search for parity - violating effects",
    "could be performed relatively easy in the processes with @xmath28-quarks in the final state , due to the possibility to trace the polarization of the tops decaying through the channel @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , in this work we would like to concentrate on the production of top quark pairs .",
    "for the top quark pairs produced at hadron colliders , the sm allows the production processes @xmath30 to violate @xmath27-parity in the next - to - leading orders due to the presence of @xmath22 and @xmath31 bosons in loop diagrams .",
    "however , this effect is shown to be negligible @xcite . on the other hand , for certain choices of susy parameters in the mssm ,",
    "it is possible to obtain a large difference between the masses of right - stop and left - stop , which in principle can lead to some noticeable asymmetries in the production of right- and left - handed top quarks .",
    "these asymmetries arise either in the next - to - leading order of the susy qcd process @xmath30 , or at the tree level of the susy qcd process @xmath32 .",
    "the asymmetries of the first type were studied earlier in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that at tevatron the difference in the cross - sections of right- and left - handed @xmath28-quark production can be of the order @xmath33 provided the right - stop is light .",
    "this conclusion holds for a wide range of gluino masses . as it will be shown below",
    ", the asymmetries of the second type can only be noticeable if gluinos are light , and the parton density of gluinos in the nucleon is comparable with that of the sea quarks .    the primary goal of this article is to present the leading order ( lo ) study of the second scenario , and to evaluate the impact of the small mass of gluino on the production of @xmath28-quarks at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in the first part of this study we obtained the lo distributions of the partons in the nucleon with the account for the possible non - zero contents of light gluinos .",
    "for this purpose we modified the fitting program used previously to obtain cteq4l parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "since our study is the leading order calculation , we considered it sufficient not to perform the complete nlo analysis of parton distributions , contrary to what was done in  @xcite .    in the course of the study , it was a surprise for us to find that the account for the new hadronic data from h1 , zeus and nmc groups  @xcite , which was not available at the time of the previous studies @xcite , tends to increase the overall @xmath16 of the fit after the inclusion of a light gluino .",
    "the reason for this is that these new data cover the region of lower @xmath25 and @xmath26 , thus making the analysis more sensitive to the slower running of the parton distributions in the susy qcd theory with a light gluino .",
    "nonetheless , we would like to be extremely cautious about this observation and refrain from any final conclusions about the consistency of the current experimental data and the susy qcd theory with a light gluino before more thorough next - to - leading order global analysis of hadronic data is made .",
    "instead , we would like to concentrate on the primary goal of this paper , namely , on the calculations of the top quark production asymmetries at the lhc .",
    "for this process , the bjorken @xmath25 of the initial state partons are allowed to lie in the range @xmath34 where the parton distributions are less dependent on the low @xmath25 data .",
    "we therefore expect the results of this work to be stable with respect to the possible changes in the parton distributions , and that these changes will not introduce an uncertainty more important than those coming from the other sources ( e.g. next - to - leading order corrections ) .    after obtaining the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the susy qcd theory with a light gluino",
    ", we calculate the degree of parity violation in the @xmath35 pairs produced via the lo @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the paper consists of 3 main sections : the description of the parton distribution functions for the susy qcd theory with a light gluino , the calculation of the cross - sections for the process @xmath37 , and the numeric analysis of the asymmetries in the left- and right - handed top quark production .",
    "finally , the conclusion summarizes the obtained results .",
    "we start the construction of parton distributions by assuming that the only superparticle , actively present in the nucleons at the energies of the supercolliders , is gluino , with its mass much smaller than the typical scales of @xmath38 production ( less than @xmath14 gev compared to @xmath39 gev ) . for the purpose of our calculation",
    ", we incorporate the gluino sector into the pdf evolution package , used recently to build the set of cteq4 unpolarized parton distributions @xcite . in order to simplify the modifications in the fitting program , we used the approach close to the one adopted by the authors of grv distributions @xcite .",
    "the input scale @xmath40 for the parton distributions was chosen to be lower than in cteq4l and equal to the mass of gluino ( assumed to be @xmath41 gev in this study , unless stated otherwise ) . at this scale ,",
    "the only input distributions are of gluons and lighter ( @xmath42 ) quarks , while the non - zero pdfs of gluinos and heavy quarks are radiatively generated at scales above their mass thresholds .    in the presence of light gluino , two aspects of the leading - order evolution of parton distributions are different from that in the standard qcd .",
    "first , the one - loop @xmath43-function , determining the running of the strong coupling @xmath44 , @xmath45 now has the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the number of active quark flavors and gluinos , respectively . in our analysis",
    ", we use @xmath49 and @xmath50 for 5 flavors .",
    "the matching of @xmath44 between 4 and 5 , and 5 and 6 flavors takes place at @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 gev respectively , which are defined as the bottom and top quark masses .",
    "second , the leading order dglap equations now should account for the splittings @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so that the singlet equation takes the form of @xmath56 the splitting functions used in ( [ sap ] ) can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .    with the help of the upgraded evolution package we performed the fit of the experimental data , closely following the procedure of the construction of cteq4l pdf set , as described in @xcite .",
    "however , for simplicity , the fit did nt use the jet data , and the value of the strong coupling was fixed to be equal to the world - average value @xmath57 . as a result",
    ", we obtained the set of parton distributions susyl , which was used throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "at the lhc , the @xmath35 pairs will be dominantly produced from the standard qcd processes of @xmath58 and @xmath59 interactions , as shown in figs .",
    "all of these diagrams preserve @xmath27-parity . in the susy qcd theory ,",
    "if the mass of gluino is small ( @xmath60 gev ) , we will also expect a noticeable contribution due to the annihilation of gluinos , described by the three diagrams of figs .",
    "the @xmath61-channel diagram of fig .",
    "1e is equivalent , up to a color factor , to the analogous @xmath58 diagram of fig .",
    "1a and does nt break parity ; however , the parity symmetry is broken in the @xmath28- and @xmath62-channels due to the mechanism of squark mass mixing which is briefly described below .    in mssm the left - squark and the right - squark , superpartners of the the left- and right - handed quarks , do not have definite mass but instead are a mixture of two mass eigenstates .",
    "these mass eigenstates @xmath63 and @xmath64 are related to the current eigenstates @xmath65 and @xmath66 by @xmath67 due to this , mssm in general allows to have nonzero asymmetries in @xmath68-pair production , defined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the cross - section of the @xmath38-pair production , integrated over the relevant part of the phase space to be discussed below . the best chance to observe a non - zero @xmath71",
    "is provided by the @xmath35 production process , where the mixing between the squarks is the largest due to the large mass of the top quark . in the following ,",
    "we ignore the mass mixing for the lighter 5 quarks .    in mssm ,",

    "\\label{mlr}\\ ] ]    the asymmetry @xmath88 depends on the angle of mixing @xmath89 in the following manner .",
    "the denominator of @xmath90 is dominated by the large contributions from the quark and gluon channels ( figs.1a - d ) and therefore shows little dependence on the masses of stops .",
    "the numerator of the asymmetry depends both on the splitting and the mixing of the squark masses .",
    "since left / right - handed quarks couple only to left / right squarks , in the case of no mass mixing ( @xmath91 ) the asymmetry is completely determined by the difference of masses @xmath92 . in this limit",
    "@xmath93 , provided that @xmath94 .    for fixed mass eigenvalues @xmath95 , the relationship ( [ mlr ] ) for the mass parameters @xmath96 puts the upper bound on @xmath97 : @xmath98 for largest @xmath97 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 in this limit , stop mass eigenstates have the maximal mixing between the left- and right - stops , so that the asymmetry @xmath88 becomes zero .",

    "the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 are equal to each other , so that the mass splitting @xmath111 is small , and of the same order of magnitude for all quark flavors . in this case , it is hard to expect observable asymmetries . on the other hand , in the general mssm right- and left - squark masses @xmath112 are considered to be independent parameters , in which case there is no theoretical limitations on the splitting of stop masses . in the following , the second point of view is accepted , so that @xmath113 is assumed to be of the order 90 - 175 gev , while @xmath114 is varied between 150 and 1000 gev .",

    "however , what can be more important are the experimental systematic uncertainties related to the measurement of the asymmetries of the order @xmath209 .",
    "in particular , it can be challenging to reach the necessary accuracy in the reconstruction of the kinematics of the @xmath38-pair , and the determination of the top quark polarization .",
    "nevertheless , the predictive power of this analysis can be increased if it is combined with the search for the signature of the light gluinos in the other kinematic regions , for instance , for the loop - generated asymmetries in the production of the top - antitop pairs with large invariant masses .",
    "in this work we propose a new method , based on the search of the possible violations of the discrete symmetries of the standard model , to test the existence of a light gluino in the mssm .",
    "this is in contrast to many other methods presented in the literature ( see the introduction section ) , in which one has to assume how a light gluino hadronizes into hadron states to be compared with the experimental measurement .",
    "we study the consequences the small mass of the gluino would have for the production of top quarks at the lhc via the tree level process @xmath32 .",
    "we show that with a large mass splitting in the masses of superpartners ( top - squarks ) of the top quark , the gluino - gluino fusion process can generate the parity - violating asymmetry in the production of left- and right - handed @xmath28-quarks .",
    "since the sm qcd theory preserves the discrete symmetry of @xmath27-parity , a small violation of such a symmetry may be observed from a large @xmath35 data sample at the lhc .",
    "for @xmath210 the largest values of the parity - violating asymmetry discussed in the previous sections is around @xmath211 for various choices of susy parameters .",
    "hence , it can in principle be observed , taking into the account the high rate of the top production at the lhc . in order to measure the asymmetry with a small statistical error , the experiment should be preferably done during the second run of lhc with an integrated luminosity of @xmath212 .",
    "the rate of the top quark production does not seem to be the major obstacle for the measurement of the parity - violating asymmetry .",
    "however , it demands a good understanding of the systematic errors , better than 1% , to reach the precision of the measurement sufficient to test the existence of a light gluino in @xmath38 pair production .",
