    "combined studies of the cosmic microwave background radiation , supernova cosmology and large galaxy redshift surveys provide nowadays compelling evidence of the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "consistency with the observed structure of the universe , especially at large ( above galactic ) scales favors cold dark matter ( cdm ) , i.e. the particles constituting the cosmologically required dark matter have to be moving non - relativistically .",
    "this property is always fulfilled by particles of mass in the gev to tev region that interact with the weak interaction strength , i.e. weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "wimps can annihilate or decay to detectable standard model particles , in particular gamma - rays , giving rise to the possibility of `` indirect detection '' @xcite .",
    "a standard approach is to look for spectral signatures in the energy spectrum of gamma - rays from celestial objects , either targeting the continuum spectrum produced by decay of secondary pions or the more feeble signature of a line due to dm annihilating directly into photons .",
    "another possible experimental signature is given by differences in the spatial distribution of gamma - ray signals induced by dm as compared to conventional astrophysical sources .",
    "in particular , the small scale fluctuations in an otherwise isotropic gamma - ray background ( igrb ) might be different in the case of annihilating dm , since its flux scales as the squared density .",
    "after the pioneering study of ando and komatsu  @xcite , followed by two other more detailed works @xcite , the issue of dm annihilation and anisotropies in the isotropic gamma background has raised increasing interest . in connection to the extra - galactic gamma - ray background , anisotropy has been further studied in @xcite while predictions from the millenium ii simulation have recently been described in zavala et al .",
    "it has also been realized that galactic substructures can produce an almost isotropic gamma background with similar fluctuation properties as the extragalactic background and with promising chances of detection @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "other works have investigated the anisotropy pattern resulting from both the galactic and extragalactic contribution @xcite or from the the dm annihilation around intermediate mass black holes @xcite .",
    "anisotropies from dm annihilation appearing in the radio sky have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "finally, apart from the power spectrum  an interesting approach is to investigate the probability distribution of the fluctuations in order to detect possible departures from gaussianity ( or , rather , from poisson statistics , in the common situation of low number of counts ) , thereby providing another handle on the separation of conventional astrophysical and dm contribution @xcite .",
    "anisotropy properties of astrophysical processes other than dm contributing to the isotropic gamma background include resolved point sources @xcite , galaxy clusters and shocks @xcite and emission from normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) , which was launched june 11 , 2008 , is the most suitable tool for these kind of studies due to its large field of view ( @xmath6 2.4 sr ) , energy coverage from 100 mev to 300 gev @xcite and very good angular resolution .",
    "we will thus focus in the following on the prospect to detect dm anisotropies with fermi - lat .",
    "all of the above studies assume either that the impact of galactic foregrounds on the dm induced anisotropies is negligible or that the galactic foregrounds can be cleaned at a suitable level to allow dm anisotropies studies .",
    "further , the effects of the fermi - lat detector are generally taken into account only in an approximate way , though a detailed representation of the fermi instrument is publicly available .",
    "the aim of this work is to address the above issues in detail .",
    "in particular our approach will be the following : we include the galactic foregrounds explicitly using a model based on the galprop code @xcite and we then use this model to build masks to select the most promising regions in the sky suitable for the analysis of the anisotropies . in these regions",
    "we study the anisotropies in the scenario in which a dm contribution is present over the galactic foregrounds and the extra - galactic emission from blazars compared to the case without dm and we derive the sensitivity to the dm signal employing anisotropy studies with fermi - lat data .",
    "both the cases of galactic dm in substructures and extra - galactic dm are considered separately .",
    "the effect of the fermi - lat response , including the effects of the point spread function , the effective area , as well as non - uniformities in exposure , are included in all calculations at a realistic level by using the instrument response functions provided by the fermi science tools .",
    "this approach is suitable for a sensitivity study like the one presented here , and does not aim to fully reproduce a real data analysis for which foreground cleaning ( not performed in this study ) most likely will be required .",
    "one of the findings of our analysis is indeed that even with a very generous masking , foregrounds still have a sizeable contribution to the overall anisotropies and represent an important limitation to dm sensitivity .",
    "this implies that foreground cleaning will be a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline . on the other hand ,",
    "if cleaning can be achieved in an effective way , this also means that the sensitivity to dm can be further improved with respect to the results derived in this paper .",
    "our results can thus be regarded as conservative from this point of view .",
    "foreground cleaning will be the subject of forthcoming investigations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce and discuss the various components contributing to the galactic and extragalactic gamma - ray emission . in sections",
    "iii and iv we review their anisotropy properties and we describe the tools and methods for their analysis . in section v we briefly describe the fermi - lat instrument and the characteristics relevant for our analysis . in section",
    "vi we discuss the results of our data simulation pipeline . finally ,",
    "in section vii we evaluate fermi s sensitivity to distinguish a scenario in which the diffuse gamma - ray emission has a dm contribution ( either extragalactic or galactic in origin ) with respect to the case in which dm is absent .",
    "conclusions are presented in section viii .",
    "in the following , for clarity , we will refer to the isotropic experimentally detected emission as the isotropic gamma - ray background ( igrb ) given that in principle its origin may be not fully extra - galactic .",
    "indeed , we will also consider the possibility of a nearly isotropic emission from dm annihilation in the milky way substructures .",
    "we will use the term extra - galactic gamma background ( egb ) when referring to predictions from _ models _ of extra - galactic emission either from dm annihilation or from astrophysical processes .",
    "a first detection of the igrb in the gev range was reported by the egret experiment @xcite ( see also the analysis by strong , moskalenko and reimer @xcite ) .",
    "the recent measurement from the fermi collaboration @xcite finds that the igrb energy spectrum has an almost perfect power law with slope @xmath7 which is approximately what is expected from the contribution of unresolved blazars thus suggesting an extragalactic origin of the igrb .    a ( possibly incomplete ) list of contributions to the igrb",
    "is given by the emission in astrophysical processes from blazars , agns , starburst galaxies , star forming galaxies , galaxy clusters , clusters shocks , gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "a contribution is also expected from ultra high energy photons and electrons cascading to gev - tev energies through interactions with the cmb or the infrared - optical background @xcite .",
    "each of these source classes is expected to produce anisotropies although all them should more or less trace the filamentary pattern of the cosmological large scale structures .",
    "anisotropies will be discussed in more detail in the next two sections .      apart from the astrophysical contributions , an exotic component arising from wimp annihilation could also be expected . in the case of",
    "uniformly distributed dm , the annihilation flux for a thermal relic cross section ( @xmath8@xmath3s@xmath4 ) is many orders magnitude below the igrb .",
    "however , given that the dm distribution on cosmological scales could be very clumpy , the enhancement factor ( denoted as @xmath9 ) due to the quadratic dependence of the annihilation signal on the dm density has to be taken into account .",
    "this enhancement is typically several orders of magnitude , thus boosting the dm signal to a level comparable to the igrb @xcite .",
    "the exact boost depends on the details of the modeling of the dm clustering , the dm halo profile and the structure formation history .",
    "we fix the absolute normalization of the dm spectra following the dm haloes clustering model described in ullio et al.(2002 ) .",
    "two versions of the model are employed : a conservative version assuming a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite for the haloes and no substructures , which gives a low dm normalization , and a more optimistic version where the haloes still follow a nfw profile but the dm signal is enhanced by the presence of substructures in the dm haloes .",
    "it should be noted that the clustering properties of the dm haloes are still very uncertain , especially at small scales ( approximately below the typical galactic halo scale ) , and even larger normalizations are possible .",
    "for example recent results from the millenium - ii simulation @xcite indicate that , depending on the extrapolation employed for the low mass haloes ( non resolved in the simulation ) , an order of magnitude enhancement with respect to the above `` optimistic '' case can be achieved .",
    "overall , place the possible values of the boost @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 in the range @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( see also @xcite , in particular fig.1 ) .      the main contribution to the galactic foregrounds",
    "is given by the decay of pions produced in the interaction of cosmic ray ( cr ) nucleons , by the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cr electrons on the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and by bremsstrahlung of cr electrons on the interstellar gas .",
    "a further contribution from pulsars has also been considered recently @xcite . according to this analysis , the contribution from galactic millisecond pulsars can be quite isotropic ( i.e. can contribute to high galactic latitudes ) and constitute a large fraction of the igrb .",
    "however , lacking more precise studies of the subject , we will neglect this contribution for the present analysis .",
    "the normalization of the galactic foregrounds is clearly important to identify the regions where the igrb is dominant , i.e. the regions most promising for the anisotropy analysis .",
    "we employ the so called `` conventional model '' @xcite which is derived under the assumption that the cr electron and nucleon spectra in the galaxy can be normalized by the local ( solar system ) measurements .",
    "this model represents a nice fit of the fermi data , at least at galactic latitudes @xmath15 , where the emission is mostly local in origin ( coming within a few kpc s of the solar position ) @xcite .",
    "we will , indeed , focus on this region of the sky in the following .",
    "the galactic center region and the galactic plane are anyway strongly dominated by the galactic emission and they are thus not suitable for the anisotropy analysis .",
    "a description of the diffuse emission in terms of the conventional model is thus accurate enough for the present analysis .",
    "the number of resolved point sources has grown considerably in the fermi era relative to the roughly 270 in the 3rd egret catalogue @xcite .",
    "the first year fermi catalogue includes 1451 sources with a significance larger than about 4 sigma @xcite .",
    "we include explicitly these sources in our analysis .",
    "as will be clear in the following , it is important to include and , in addition , to model this component correctly since it is a considerable source of anisotropy which needs to be reduced to gain sensitivity to the anisotropies of the diffuse component .",
    "while we use the first year catalogue , in the following we produce a forecast over 5 years of data taking , thus should in principle be using an associated 5 years catalogue .",
    "the effect of using a five year catalogue , however , is expected to be small : the masked area will increase , but on the other hand the poisson noise will be reduced .",
    "both effects are small since increasing the data taking time for the catalogue will add sources on the faint end , requiring small masking area and producing a small decrease in poisson noise ( since the brightest sources are already removed ) .",
    "on the other hand , modeling the 5 year catalogue requires an assumption on the nature of the unresolved sources , introducing a model uncertainty .",
    "we therefore decided to use the 1 year catalogue only .",
    "part of the igrb is made of _ unresolved point sources_. it is still a matter of debate if unresolved point sources can make up all the igrb or only part of it .",
    "this issue is likely to become clearer when population studies of the fermi _ resolved point sources _ become available .",
    "present studies indicate that unresolved blazars can only account for at most 30 % of the igrb measured by the fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "unresolved point sources can also be a further source of anisotropy in the igrb itself , producing a poisson noise  like contribution to the anisotropy spectrum .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that this poisson noise is different from the poisson shot noise in the angular power spectrum ( see below and appendix a ) , which is related to the finite number of counts .",
    "the contribution of unresolved point sources depends both on the ability of the fermi - lat to detect point sources and remove them from the diffuse emission and on the intrinsic number density of the sources themselves .",
    "both these terms , in turn , are quite model dependent but they are expected to be reasonably constrained from population studies of source classes with resolved members .    for the moment , for the sake of studying the importance of the effect , we consider , beside the model described in the next section , a model fully made of unresolved point sources . for the poisson noise",
    "we assume a value of @xmath16 which is in the middle between the estimate of @xmath17 @xcite ( see their fig.4 ) and the preliminary measurement of @xmath18 from the fermi collaboration @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that the poisson noise of unresolved sources is a time varying term slowly decreasing in time .",
    "the brighter unresolved sources , in fact , get finally resolved , as fermi continues to collect more statistics , and once they are removed , and/or masked , the `` new '' remaining unresolved signal has a slightly lower level of poisson noise .",
    "a detailed study of this effect requires extrapolation from population studies which we leave for future work .    in figure",
    "[ fig : diffuse ] we show the energy spectrum of the various galactic and extra - galactic components for the model we employ .",
    "in particular , we show the average spectrum in the regions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where the igrb has the highest relative contribution . we show the power law fit to of the igrb from @xcite . also shown",
    "is an example of extragalactic wimp emission normalized to the model of ullio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( with nfw halo profile and no halo substructures ) .",
    "the contribution from resolved point sources detected by fermi @xcite,@xcite is also present .",
    "it can be seen that , combined , these sources constitute a significant fraction of the diffuse background . for simplicity",
    ", the spectrum of each single source is modeled as a simple power law and thus the behavior at high energies ( @xmath21 gev ) may have some biases with respect to the real spectrum .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we can see the results in fig . [",
    "fig : limitsa ] , where the sensitivities are reported for various annihilation channels .",
    "the absolute normalization of the dm spectra are obtained following the dm haloes clustering model of @xcite as described in the introduction .",
    "two versions of the model are shown : a conservative version with a nfw profile for the haloes and no substructures which gives a low dm normalization , and thus weaker constraints , and a more optimistic version where the dm signal is enhanced by the presence of substructures in the dm haloes . in principle , using the recent results of@xcite from the millenium - ii simulation , an order of magnitude enhancement with respect to the above `` optimistic '' case can be achieved with a correspondingly better sensitivity ( see also @xcite , in particular fig.1 ) .",
    "the various channels have generally similar behavior .",
    "the @xmath22 channel produces quite smooth limits .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 sensitivity curves in contrast have a steeper slope and exhibit more structure .",
    "this is due to the fact that for these channels the gamma emission is concentrated at higher energies in a narrow peak near the energy corresponding to the dm mass .",
    "the sensitivity is thus more sensitive to the coarse binning in energy chosen for this analysis .",
    "the sensitivity in the @xmath24 channel and especially the @xmath23 channel at higher dm masses somewhat decreases due to the lower number of photons per annihilation ( and thus lower statistics ) available .    including the cross - correlation spectra information does not seem to improve the sensitivity .",
    "this probably has to be ascribed to the fact that the @xmath25 for the auto - correlation case already includes some cross - correlation information in the off - diagonal terms of the covariance matrix .",
    "the level of anisotropies is also very low at low energy for this case ( see fig.[fig : anieni ] ) and this somewhat reduces the importance of the information contained in the cross - correlation .",
    "the situation is different for the galactic dm scenario as discussed below .",
    "we also checked the case in which only the highest energy bands are employed for the analysis .",
    "we would expect an improvement in sensitivity given that very little dm signal is expected in the 0.4 - 0.8 gev band and thus scanning in this energy range introduces a statistical penalty factor .",
    "we find that the sensitivity indeed improves , but only marginally . on the other hand ,",
    "the lowest energy band is useful because being mostly clean of dm it represents a good calibration for the background anisotropies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : limitsb ] we show the case in which the dm anisotropy pattern does not vary with energy .",
    "this case is supposed to mimic the dm emission from unresolved substructures in the milky way .",
    "we thus simulate a single anisotropic map which we use for all energies .",
    "the angular spectrum for dm employed to simulate the map is normalized as in the case of substructures with a minimum mass of 10 @xmath26 as derived in @xcite and it roughly corresponds to the extragalactic anisotropies for an energy of about 300 gev ( see section 2 ) . for a direct comparison with the cosmological case we use for the galactic signal the same normalization employed for the extragalactic case , which is justified by the fact that more physically motivated models for the dm emission in the mw have a large degree of freedom @xcite and",
    "can easily be tuned to match the extragalactic case .",
    "the inclusion of the information from the cross - correlation spectra in this case , contrary to the cosmological one , gives a significant improvement , especially for higher dm masses .",
    "the reason for this difference is likely to be found in the very different set of anisotropy maps employed for the galactic substructures case . in particular , the very high degree of anisotropy",
    "present also at low energy for this case enhances the importance of a direct measurement of the cross - correlation between low and high energy bands .",
    "in contrast , the very low dm anisotropy at low energy for the cosmological case ( lower than the astrophysical egb anisotropy ) makes this information almost irrelevant .",
    "we also find in this case that excluding the lowest energy band does not improve the sensitivity significantly .",
    "the sensitivity increases substantially with respect to the cosmological case , especially for high dm masses .",
    "the slope of the sensitivity curves is indeed slightly less steep . assuming higher levels of anisotropy for the galactic case , which are possible , @xcite a correspondingly higher sensitivity could be achieved .",
    "however , the scaling is not linear .",
    "it is worth noting for example that although at about 10 gev the galactic anisotropies are about 2 orders of magnitudes larger than the extragalactic ones , the sensitivity is only a factor 2 - 3 better",
    ". the scaling however is better for @xmath27 gev where the difference in sensitivity is roughly a factor of 10 .",
    "this non linear scaling is due to the limited limited amount of detected photons ( as it is the case at the edges of the sensitivity curve ) . here",
    ", it is very difficult to distinguish between the two ( galactic and extra - galactic ) levels of anisotropies even if the latter is a factor 100 larger , since the statistical error bars are also very large .",
    "the much larger galactic anisotropy thus only modestly decrease the minimum amount of events required to detect the signal .    finally in fig .",
    "[ fig : limitcp ] we show the impact on the dm sensitivity of changing the underlying astrophysical egb model to the poisson dominated one . for illustration ,",
    "only the extragalactic @xmath24 case with nfw profile and substructures is shown .",
    "the interesting results ( perhaps somewhat counter intuitive ) is that even with this increased level of background in the anisotropy spectrum , still the sensitivity to the dm component remains roughly unchanged .",
    "the reason is that a poisson noise at the level of 5.0e-5 is anyway clearly detected with a statistics of 5 years , so the dm component can still be easily detected as a modulation ( as usual , in multipole and in energy ) of this dominant poisson noise anisotropy spectrum .",
    "the underlying assumption here , however , is that this new background is fully under control and well characterized . the extent to which this will be true is however not clear and a better understanding may require dedicated simulations and analyses which are beyond the scope of this paper .    , extragalactic anisotropies and nfw halo profile with substructures , for the two cases of egb background anisotropies from the correlation term only ( same case of fig.[fig : limitsb ] , solid contours ) and from a pure poisson term only ( dashed contours).[fig : limitcp ] ]",
    "in the present analysis we have calculated the sensitivity to dark matter annihilation exploiting the characteristic anisotropy properties that dm would imprint in the extra - galactic gamma background .",
    "we performed a realistic simulation of the fermi - lat including the effect of the point spread function , effective area and of the anisotropic sky exposure .",
    "more importantly , we investigated the impact of galactic foregrounds on the dm anisotropy sensitivity using a galprop model to produce the sky maps of the galactic gamma emission .",
    "the contribution of galactic foregrounds is generally non negligible even above galactic latitudes of about @xmath28 .",
    "foreground cleaning will thus be an important ( and likely challenging ) issue in the analysis of the real data .",
    "for the present work we do not attempt foreground cleaning ( except for masking the galactic plane and point sources ) and we only require that the anisotropy from dm has to exceed the level of foregrounds anisotropy to be detectable . further , we only analyze a high galactic latitude region where the model dependence of the foreground is expected to be moderate . in this respect",
    "our analysis can be regarded as a conservative one : in reality , if foreground cleaning can be effectively implemented , a sensitivity to a lower level of anisotropy can be achievable .",
    "also , a larger fraction of the sky can be employed than the small conservative one used in the present analysis .",
    "we leave a more careful investigation of the issue for future work .    despite the difficulties involved in the foreground analysis",
    ", we find that the prospects for detecting dm anisotropy signatures are promising .",
    "for some wimp masses , sensitivity to @xmath29@xmath3s@xmath4(i.e . the thermal relic value ) can be achieved using the anisotropy information alone .",
    "interestingly , these constraints are comparable to what is achievable using the energy spectrum alone @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy information is thus complementary to the energy spectrum and provides a cross - check and an increase in the overall sensitivity to the dm signal .",
    "we also investigated the recently proposed scenario of a population of dm substructures in the milky way halo as predicted by n - body simulations .",
    "these subhaloes give rise to an annihilation signal which is almost uniform in the sky and which can be comparable in intensity to the observed isotropic gamma background .",
    "for this case , the anisotropy signal is predicted to be even higher than for the extragalactic case due to the huge clumpiness of the dm distribution that correspondingly gives an enhanced sensitivity .",
    "we find , indeed , that when increasing the anisotropy the sensitivity to the dm signal increases as well with an improvement of a factor of @xmath610 for @xmath27 gev .    in summary , simulations indicate that , with the sensitivity of the fermi - lat , detailed anisotropies studies of the gamma - ray sky can be performed .",
    "the next obvious step will be the analysis of the actual data .",
    "anisotropy analyses will soon provide a complementary source of information which will give further insights into the dm problem and the properties of high - energy astrophysical sources .",
    "the authors would like to thank toby burnett , jennifer siegal - gaskins and eiichiro komatsu for their numerous comments and suggestions for improvement , and chris savage for a carefully reading of the manuscript .",
    "we also wish to thank gianfranco bertone for organizing the workshop `` gamma in zurich '' which stimulated many interesting discussions on gamma - ray anisotropies .",

    "we summarize in this appendix the conventions and notation used for the anisotropy analysis .",
    "the anisotropy of a signal on the sky can be quantified in terms of the power spectrum i.e. the spherical harmonic transform on the sphere .",
    "more specifically , a map on the sphere @xmath30 can be decomposed in spherical harmonics as @xmath31 and the angular power spectrum can then be defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 indicates the statistical ensemble average .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is an unbiased estimator of the true power spectrum @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 .    in the case of two maps , besides the two autocorrelation power spectra @xmath37 and @xmath38 , further information is contained in the _ cross - correlation power spectrum _ which can be estimated as @xmath39 where the equivalence of the two expressions comes from the equality : @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the three spectra are of course not independent but are part of a covariance matrix : @xmath42 which has to be taken into account when evaluating the errors for the forecast .",
    "this is described in more details in the next section .    in practice , to calculate the power spectra , the harmonic transform @xmath43 is performed with healpix @xcite after binning the events into maps of the healpix format itself . due to the finite number @xmath44 of collected events beside the intrinsic anisotropies",
    "the data also contain noise ( shot noise or white noise ) which appears in the power spectrum as a constant whose value is @xmath45 .",
    "the noise sets the limit above which the intrinsic anisotropies can be detected .",
    "it is standard to remove the shot noise from the spectrum showing only the intrinsic power spectrum .",
    "it is also customary to show not the power spectrum @xmath35 but the quantity @xmath46 .",
    "in the general case in which we include as observables the cross - correlation power spectra the covariance matrix can be calculated by propagation of the errors from the expressions [ pspectrum ] and [ cspectrum ] and then taking the ensemble average . the variance @xmath47 of the cross - correlation spectrum @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) can be written as @xmath50 we then have the case of covariance @xmath51 between an auto - correlation spectrum @xmath52 and cross - correlation spectrum @xmath53 . for this case",
    "we have @xmath54 for the case of covariance between two cross - correlation spectra we have to distinguish two cases . in the case of covariance @xmath55 between @xmath48 and @xmath56 where there is an energy band ( an index ) in common we have : @xmath57 if instead there is no energy band ( no index ) in common @xmath58 finally we have @xmath59    expression ( [ autocorrerror ] ) and ( [ crosscorrerror ] ) can also be rewritten in the more familiar form @xmath60 for the auto - correlation spectra and by @xmath61 for the cross - correlation spectra , where again @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the number of binned multipole in the band @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the density of the counts per steradian in the map @xmath66 ."

    "<S> we perform a detailed study of the sensitivity to the anisotropies related to dark matter ( dm ) annihilation in the isotropic gamma - ray background ( igrb ) as measured by the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , we take into account the effects of the galactic foregrounds and use a realistic representation of the fermi - lat . we implement an analysis pipeline which simulates fermi - lat data sets starting from model maps of the galactic foregrounds , the fermi resolved point sources , the extra - galactic diffuse emission and the signal from dm annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the detector are taken into account by convolving the model maps with the fermi - lat instrumental response . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the angular power spectrum to characterize the anisotropy properties of the simulated data and to study the sensitivity to dm . </S>",
    "<S> we consider dm anisotropies of extra - galactic origin and of galactic origin ( which can be generated through annihilation in the milky way sub - structures ) as opposed to a background of anisotropies generated by sources of astrophysical origin , blazars for example . </S>",
    "<S> we find that with statistics from 5 years of observation fermi is sensitive to a dm contribution at the level of 1%-10% of the measured igrb depending on the dm mass @xmath0 and annihilation mode . in terms of the thermally averaged cross section @xmath1 , this corresponds to @xmath2@xmath3s@xmath4 , i.e. slightly above the typical expectations for a thermal relic , for low values of the dm mass @xmath5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy method for dm searches has a sensitivity comparable to the usual methods based only on the energy spectrum and thus constitutes an independent and complementary piece of information in the dm puzzle . </S>"
