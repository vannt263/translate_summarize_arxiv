    "as we celebrate the centennial of the american physical society , we honor the founding of equilibrium statistical mechanics , which also took place about a century ago .",
    "that breakthrough enables us to understand thermodynamics in terms of microscopics .",
    "further , predictions based on the boltzmann - gibbs framework have been applied with so much success that we now take for granted many of the inventions of the industrial revolution , e.g. , automobiles , 747 s , power stations , etc .",
    "yet , it may be argued that no systems are truly `` in equilibrium '' , since infinite times and infinite thermal reservoirs or perfect insulations would be necessary .",
    "indeed , essentially _ all _ natural phenomena bear the marks of _ non-_equilibrium processes . unlike the aforementioned class of `` artificial '' systems , most natural systems are not `` set up '' with special conditions , under which equilibrium statistical mechanics provides excellent approximations .",
    "unfortunately , the theory of _ non - equilibrium _ statistical mechanics is far less developed than its equilibrium counterpart . as a result ,",
    "the most ubiquitous phenomena are the most poorly understood .",
    "in fact , relying on the intuition from equilibrium physics , we are often surprised , even by the behavior of systems in _ non - equilibrium steady states_. these form a small subset of non - equlibrium phenomena where the states are _ time - independent _ , mimicking systems in equilibrium . in this article ,",
    "the main differences between systems in equilibrium and non - equilibrium steady states will be highlighted .",
    "for example , stationary distributions of the former are well known .",
    "in contrast , we have no simple boltzmann - like factor , @xmath2 , for non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "fortunately , with the aid of modern computers , it is possible to explore the behavior of simple model systems in stationary states far from equilibrium .",
    "an excellent example is the driven ising lattice gas . despite its simplicity , simulations continue to reveal a seemingly unending list of counter - intuitive phenomena . yet , because of its simplicity , some of these surprises are now reasonably well understood .    from textbooks ,",
    "we learn that the first step in equilibrium statistical mechanics is to apply the fundamental hypothesis to a physical system in complete isolation : every configuration , @xmath1 ( or microstate ) , available to the system may be found with equal probability : @xmath3\\propto 1 $ ] . by energy conservation , @xmath4}$ ] ( the energy associated with @xmath1 , which may include external _",
    "static potentials _ ) can not change , i.e. , @xmath5 . extending our scope to a system which can exchange energy with a much larger ( theoretically infinte ) reservoir and applying the fundamental hypothesis to the combination , we arrive at the canonical ensemble : when equilibriated , the probability for finding a system in @xmath1 , @xmath6 $ ] , is proportional to @xmath7}/k_bt)$ ] , where @xmath8 is the temperature associated with the thermal reservoir . in this stationary state , on the average",
    ", the energy of our system is a constant , which may be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "fluctuations around this constant can be traced to losses or gains to the reservoir , while the average energy _ flux _ between them is zero .    here , we are interested in a system exchanging energies with _ two _ or more reservoirs , which are not coupled otherwise . if , say , the reservoirs are set at _ different temperatures _ initially",
    ", then we may expect the following scenario . assuming the reservoirs are much larger than our system ,",
    "then there should be a time when our system would be in a stationary state , while the reservoirs are still close to their initial states . in this sense ,",
    "the combined system is far from equilibrium , with energy flowing from the hotter reservoir to the colder one .",
    "however , if we focus on our system alone , we find that its energy is constant on the average .",
    "keeping in mind the presence of two reservoirs ( for which we use the subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath10 ) , we denote this situation by @xmath11 .",
    "this state is also far from the equilibrium state , since there is a non - zero flux flowing _ through _ it . on the average ,",
    "it gains a non - trivial amount of energy from one reservoir and loses energy to the other .",
    "in other words , neither term in the above equation vanishes : @xmath12 .",
    "we will refer to such systems as being in _ non - equilibrium steady states_. examples abound in nature , from our planet as a whole to simple daily activities like cooking .",
    "the fundamental question for these states is : what is the stationary distribution @xmath13 $ ] ?    because our problem is inherently a time dependent one , we believe that the most appropriate approach is to start with the @xmath14-dependent distribution : @xmath15,$ ] the time evolution of which is governed by the master equation : @xmath16=\\sum_{{\\cal c}^{\\prime } } \\left\\ { r\\left ( { \\cal c}^{\\prime } \\rightarrow { \\cal c}\\right ) p[{\\cal c}^{\\prime } ; t]-r\\left ( { \\cal c}\\rightarrow { \\cal c}^{\\prime } \\right ) p[{\\cal c}% ; t]\\right\\ } \\equiv { \\bbb l}p .   \\label{meq}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 stands for the rate with which a configuration @xmath1 changes to @xmath18 and , in principle , can be found once we specify how our system is coupled to the various reservoirs",
    ". then , the stationary @xmath19 will be `` just '' the ( right ) eigenvector of @xmath20 with _ zero _ eigenvalue : @xmath21    for physical systems , the task of finding the @xmath22 s is clearly too complex .",
    "on the other hand , the success of equilibrium statistical mechanics suggests those @xmath19 s are independent of the details of the rates .",
    "apart from mixing ( all the configurations being connected by the @xmath22 s ) , the condition on the rates so that our system arrives at thermal equilibrium ( being coupled to a single reservoir at temperature @xmath8 ) is known as detailed balance : @xmath23}-{\\cal h[c]}}{k_bt}\\right\\ }   \\label{db}\\ ] ] numerous successful monte carlo simulations of systems in equilibrium are based on choosing the metropolis rate @xcite : @xmath24}-{\\cal h[c]})/k_bt}].$ ] it is clear that , with rates satisfying eqn.([db ] ) , the boltzmann @xmath25 is a stationary distribution .",
    "moreover , the equation @xmath26 is satisfied by @xmath27 for _ every pair _",
    "@xmath28    an important distinction for a system evolving toward non - equilibrium steady states is that eqn.([db ] ) no longer holds .",
    "the effects of two reservoirs can not be embodied in eqn.([db ] ) .",
    "the stationary distribution @xmath19 is not known without solving @xmath29 first while _ each term _ on the right hand side of eqn.([meq ] ) is not necessarily zero .",
    "a good analogue with electromagnetism is to regard eqn.([meq ] ) as a continuity equation .",
    "then each @xmath1 is analogous to a node in a circuit while the terms on the right are net currents between pairs of nodes . while equilibrium corresponds to electrostatics ( with time - independent charge distribution and zero currents ) , non - equilibrium steady states correspond to magnetostatics , for which currents are steady but non - vanishing . given this sharp contrast between equilibrium and non - equilibrium steady states , it is not surprising that the latter problem is considerably more difficult , since @xmath19 itself is unknown _ a priori_. on the other hand ,",
    "the variety and richness is also much greater . in general",
    ", @xmath19 will depend on the details of the rates , although we expect the `` universality classes '' of @xmath22 s leading to the same @xmath19 to be just as large as in the equilibrium case . in this short article",
    ", we will focus only on a particularly simple model  the driven ising lattice gas @xcite . though the model appears simple",
    ", there is no analytic solution , so that its properties are generally explored through computer simulations .",
    "now , most non - equilibrium systems are not translationally invariant .",
    "typically , temperature gradients or velocity shears are present , so that the usual thermodynamic limits can not be taken . as a result ,",
    "the co - operative behavior in such systems is much more difficult to analyse than that in systems with translational invariance .",
    "an advantage of our simple model is that not only is it translationally invariant , it displays a host of surprising phenomena when driven to non - equilibrium steady states . in the next section , we will present a brief summary of the specifications of this model and some of the remarkable discoveries from monte carlo simulation studies . in many situations ,",
    "the well honed arguments of equilibrium statistical mechanics , based on the competition between energy and entropy , fail dramatically .",
    "more details may be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "section 3 is devoted to some recent developments while some concluding remarks are included in the last .",
    "motivated by the physics of fast ionic conductors @xcite , katz , lebowitz and spohn introduced a simple model in 1983 @xcite , which has served as a primary testing ground for exploring unusual properties of non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "it consists of an ising lattice gas @xcite with attractive nearest - neighbor interactions , driven far from equilibrium by an external `` electric '' field , @xmath10 . in the spin language",
    ", it is a ferromagnetic ising model with _ biased _ spin - exchange @xcite dynamics .",
    "major reasons for choosing this model are:@xmath30having a translationally invariant dynamics , the steady state is expected to be also invariant;@xmath30the two reservoirs are coupled through an _",
    "an_isotropic dynamics;@xmath30many of its equilibrium properties are well - known , especially in two dimensions ( @xmath31 ) @xcite;@xmath30it is a system with non - trivial phases in @xmath32 , whether driven or not;@xmath30the equilibrium system can be reached continuously by taking the @xmath33 limit ; and@xmath30a different equilibrium system can be reached by choosing appropriate boundary conditions.for completeness , we give a brief description of the @xmath31 model here . on a square lattice with fully periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "each of the @xmath34 sites may be occupied by a particle or left vacant , so that a configuration @xmath1 of our system is completely specified by the occupation numbers @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a site label and @xmath37 is either 1 or 0 .",
    "translating the spin language of ising@xcite is simple : @xmath38 .",
    "an attractive interaction between pairs of particles in nearest - neighbor sites is modeled by the usual hamiltonian : @xmath4}% = -4j\\sum_{<i , j>}n_in_j$ ] , with @xmath39 .",
    "the factor of 4 means that @xmath40 assumes the form @xmath41 in the spin language , so that , in the thermodynamic limit , the system undergoes a second order phase transition at the onsager @xcite critical temperature @xmath42 . for the lattice gas , this point can be reached only for half - filled systems , i.e. , @xmath43 @xmath44 . in monte carlo simulations for a lattice coupled to a thermal bath at temperature @xmath8",
    ", particles are allowed to hop to vacant nearest neighbor sites with probability @xmath45 $ ] @xcite , where @xmath46 is the change in @xmath40 after the particle - hole exchange .",
    "note that these rules conserve the total particle number @xmath47 , so that half - filled lattices must be used , if critical behavior is to be studied . starting from some initial state , this dynamics should bring the system into the equilibrium state with stationary distribution @xmath48\\propto",
    "e^{-{\\cal h[c]}/k_bt}$ ] .",
    "the deceptively simple modification introduced by katz , et .",
    "@xcite is an external `` electric '' field . pretending the particles are `` charged ''",
    ", the effect of the drive is to modify the hopping rates to biased ones .",
    "specifically , the jump probabilities are now @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 , for a particle attempting to hop ( against , orthogonal to , along ) the drive and @xmath10 is the strength of the field .",
    "note that , locally , the effect of the external field is identical to that due to gravity .",
    "indeed , had we imposed `` brick wall '' boundary conditions ( particles reflected at the boundary , comparable to a floor or a ceiling ) , this system would eventually settle into an _ equilibrium _ state , like gas molecules in a room on earth .",
    "of course , the reason behind this outcome is that gravitation is a _",
    "static potential _ and can be incorporated into @xmath4}$ ] .",
    "the `` price '' paid is the loss of translational invariance due to the presence of boundaries , leading to inhomogeneous particle densities .",
    "returning to our model , in which _ periodic _ boundary conditions are imposed , we see that translational invariance is completely restored so that , in the final steady state , the particle density is _ homogeneous _",
    ", for all @xmath8 above some finite critical @xmath51 . at the same time , a particle current will be present .",
    "for gravity , such a situation exists only in art @xcite . in physics",
    ", this situation can be realised only with an _ electric _ field .",
    "thanks to faraday , a constant electric field circulating around the surface of a cylinder can be set up by applying a linearly increasing , axial magnetic field .",
    "if the particles are charged , they will experience the same force everywhere on the cylinder . as they also lose energy to the thermal bath , a steady state with finite current can be established . with this possibility in mind",
    ", we will use the term `` electric '' field to describe the external drive and imagine our particles to be `` charged '' .",
    "we should caution the reader that , unlike real charges , our particles are not endowed with coulomb interactions between them , just like the typical neglect of gravitational attraction between gas molecules .",
    "finally , note that a well defined , single - valued , _ potential _ which gives rise to such an electric field is necessarily time dependent .",
    "given the microscopic model , we can ask : what are its collective properties when it settles down in a non - equilibrium steady state ?",
    "in particular , what is @xmath13 $ ] ?",
    "since there is no global hamiltonian , we can not exploit boltzmann s result .",
    "instead , we must resort to the master equation ( [ meq ] ) and attempt to find the solution to @xmath21 though @xmath52 is a sparse matrix , finding @xmath19 is a non - trivial task . only for very small systems",
    "can @xmath19 be obtained @xcite .",
    "of course , it is difficult to discern collective behavior such as phase transitions in `` microscopic '' systems like these .",
    "nevertheless , we can already see that the @xmath19 s here ( fig .",
    "1a ) are quite distinct from @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "also , at this level , we can derive an interesting consequence : the violation of the standard fluctuation dissipation theorem .",
    "computing @xmath53 and @xmath54 , it is easy to verify that , in the driven case , @xmath55    turning to collective phenomena on the macroscopic scale , we face serious difficulties in finding @xmath19 analytically , let alone solving for thermodynamic quantities a la onsager . without modern computers , it would be impossible to make much progress . using simulation techniques",
    ", we may answer questions like : what happens to the second order phase transition found by onsager ?",
    "in particular , how does the critical temperature depend on the drive , i.e. , what is @xmath56 ?",
    "several simple possibilities come to mind : a ) @xmath56 jumps to infinity for any @xmath10 , i.e. , the drive , however small , orders the system .",
    "b ) @xmath56 rises with @xmath10 indefinitely .",
    "c ) @xmath56 rises with @xmath10 , saturating at some finite temperature @xmath57 .",
    "d ) @xmath56 is independent of @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "e ) @xmath56 decreases with @xmath10 , either dropping to zero at finite @xmath10 , or saturating at a finite @xmath59 .",
    "f ) @xmath56 jumps to zero for any @xmath10 , i.e. , the drive , however small , disorders the system .",
    "while possibilities ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( f ) appear incredulous , intuitive arguments might be made for ( d ) and ( e ) . the naive argument for ( d )",
    "is that , in an inertial frame where the global current vanishes , the system should look just like an equilibrium ising model . on the other hand , to arrive at ( e ) , we think of the drive as gravity , feeding energy into the system , so that its effects should be the same as a reservoir with a temperature higher than the surrounding bath .",
    "therefore , to order the system , the bath temperature would have to lowered , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "in reality , simulations @xcite offered the first surprise : @xmath56 _ increasing _ with @xmath10 and saturating at @xmath61 @xcite ! a number of arguments now exists for this behavior , but all are `` post - dictions '' . indeed ,",
    "none of these are convincing , while approximate schemes for analytic computations of @xmath56 offer only hints to the puzzle of @xmath62 @xcite .    as the system",
    "is probed deeper , more surprises appear . due to space limitations",
    ", we only list some of them here , refering the interested reader to @xcite for further details .      in the equilibrium system , there is little of interest far above criticality .",
    "correlations are short ranged so that most properties can be understood through landau - ginzburg mean field theory .",
    "when driven , however , this system displays@xmath30long range two - point correlations , decaying as @xmath64 @xcite@xmath30singular structure factors , with a discontinuity at the origin @xcite@xmath30non - trivial three point correlations , the fourier transforms of which show infinite discontinuities at the origin @xcite;@xmath30a fixed line , rather than the gaussian fixed point , governing large - scale , long time behavior @xcite;@xmath30shape - dependent thermodynamics@xcite      in 1944 , onsager solved the @xmath31 ising model and computed many of its critical properties .",
    "however , the deeper understanding of critical phenomena came only in the 70 s , with the advent of field theoretic renormalization group analysis@xcite . within this framework ,",
    "we learnt that a large class of systems fall into the ising universality class , controlled by the wilson - fisher fixed point@xcite . when driven into non - equilibrium states , @xmath30only ordering into strips parallel to @xmath10 occurs;@xmath30only one of the two lowest structure factors diverges;@xmath30strong anisotropy appears while longitudinal and transverse momenta scale differently;@xmath30the critical dimension is 5 instead of 4 ; @xmath30a new , non - hamiltonian , fixed point and universality class is identified @xcite;@xmath30a host of new exponents , though only one independent , emerges ; and@xmath30anisotropic finite size scaling is essential for data collapse @xcite .",
    "we should note that , unlike properties far from @xmath51 , the critical properties were predicted by theory @xcite well before confirmations from computer simulation studies @xcite .      below the critical point ,",
    "phase segregation and co - existence occurs , with interfaces separating the particle rich from the particle poor regions . due to the periodic boundary conditions , each region is a single strip wrapped around the torus . unlike in equilibrium , only strips _",
    "parallel _ to the drive exist .",
    "correlations within each region are also expected to be long ranged , though they have not been studied carefully so far .",
    "some intriguing properties of the interfaces , dramatically different from equilibrium @xcite ones , are : @xmath30statistical widths remaining finite as @xmath67 @xcite rather than diverging as @xmath68 ; @xmath30the structure factor diverging as @xmath69 @xcite instead of the usual @xmath70 of capillary waves@xcite ; @xmath30interface orientation affecting _ bulk _ energies @xcite ; and@xmath30instabilities when forced to lie at a non - vanishing angle with respect to the drive@xcite .",
    "in addition to interface anomalies , other remarkable features include@xmath30coarsening during a quench showing several time regimes and asymmetries which can not be accounted for by a modified cahn - hilliard theory @xcite;@xmath30systems subjected to _ shifted _ periodic boundary conditions displaying new , multistrip phases @xcite ; and@xmath30systems subjected to _ open _ periodic boundary conditions displaying icicle like fingers@xcite .",
    "as we try to convey in this section , there are still many unresolved mysteries associated with this decepetively simple model . in the next section",
    ", we will present some recent , on - going investigations which attempt to probe deeper into the simple driven lattice gas .",
    "in the introduction , we emphasized the importance of energy flow _ through _ our system in a non - equilibrium steady state . there has been no systematic study of this aspect , even though it may contain a key to the understanding of such systems .",
    "we begin by simply confirming our intuitive picture : that typical jumps parallel / trasverse to the field are associated with energy gain / loss . in the previous section",
    ", we showed the complete solution for a @xmath71 lattice . using those @xmath19 s",
    ", we can compute these gains / losses and then compare them with monte carlo simulations @xcite . the results are best displayed as histograms for all possible values of @xmath46 after an attempted jump .",
    "there are two such histograms , associated with the two types of jumps .",
    "we also performed the same analysis for the equilibrium case .",
    "it is reassuring that simulations confirm , within statistical errors , all theoretical predictions .",
    "encouraged by these results , we carried out simulations on a @xmath72 lattice @xcite .",
    "figure 2a shows that , for the equilibrium case , both histograms are entirely symmetric ( within statistical errors ) , so that the gains / losses balance for either types of jumps .",
    "by contrast , figure 2b shows asymmetric histograms , confirming our expectation that the systems tends to gain energy when a particle jumps in the field direction , etc .",
    "our hope is that a good approximation scheme , within the theoretical framework described above , can be found leading to quantitative predictions of these histograms .",
    "since the drive introduces a non - trivial anisotropy into the ising lattice gas , it is natural to ask how @xmath10 might compete with anisotropic _",
    "couplings_. the equilibrium model is part of onsager s solution , so that we may again compare driven cases with well - known results . since the drive enhances longitudinal correlations , we had expected that `` @xmath56 will be higher ( lower ) if the drive is aligned with the stronger ( weaker ) bonds '' @xcite .",
    "subsequent simulations showed the opposite@xcite !",
    "indeed , with saturation drive , @xmath56 can drop _ below _",
    "@xmath73 for @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the ratio of the coupling along the field direction to the `` transverse '' coupling . motivated to look into the behavior displayed at various temperatures",
    ", we find that the typical configurations are indeed disordered for @xmath76 and ordered into a single strip for @xmath77",
    ". however , there is a significant range of temperatures where the system appears to be `` ordered '' in the drive direction without being in a single strip . in other words , while the densities in each column ( i.e. , along the drive ) are bi - modally distributed @xcite , the usual order parameter ( @xmath78 , structure factor with lowest transverse wave number ) is still quite small . in more picturesque language",
    ", we call this a `` stringy '' state .",
    "actually , this type of configurations have been previously reported @xcite .",
    "but they were believed to be long transients on the way from disordered initial states to ordered ones and thus , disregarded . by contrast , we observed that , starting from ordered states , the system evolves towards , and spends considerable periods of time in , the stringy states .    in an effort to quantify these states",
    ", we define the ratio : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the ( untruncated ! ) two point correlation function , with @xmath81 being parallel to the drive , and @xmath82 is the structure factor , used ordinarily as the order parameter . in particular , we are interested in the behavior of @xmath83 as @xmath84 .    far in the disordered phase , as a result of the @xmath85 decay , we have @xmath86 while @xmath87 . on the other hand , deep in the ordered phase @xmath88 while @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , as long as the system is far from criticality , we have    @xmath90    near criticality , if there are no stringy states , we may apply the results of renormalization group analysis @xcite  @xmath91/(1+\\delta ) } $ ] and @xmath92  to arrive at @xmath93 \\delta /(1+\\delta ) } $ ] . here",
    ", @xmath94 is the exponent associated with anisotropic scaling of the momenta ( @xmath95 ) , and is found to be @xmath96 to all orders in the expansion around @xmath97 thus , for our simulations in @xmath31 , we see that @xmath83 _ decreases _ with @xmath98    @xmath99    by contrast , _ in a stringy state _ , ordering has set in for the longitudinal direction so that @xmath100 .",
    "meanwhile , complete phase segregation into just two regions is yet to take place , so that @xmath87 . as a result , we expect    @xmath101    which is an _ increasing _ function of @xmath102 the differences between the three behaviors ( [ far - from tc ] , [ dds - tc ] , and [ stringy ] ) should be dramatic enough to discern in simulations .    to provide further contrast , we perform the above analysis for ising models in _",
    "equilibrium_. above criticality , @xmath103 and @xmath104 so that @xmath83 decreases exponentially as @xmath105 .",
    "near @xmath106 we have @xmath107 and @xmath108 leading to @xmath109 .",
    "the behavior deep in the ordered phase is unchanged .",
    "so , in all cases , @xmath83 should _ not increase with _ @xmath110 .    turning to simulations , we find that the stringy state seems to be most pronounced for large @xmath111 in particular",
    ", we focused on models with @xmath112 and saturation drive and compiled data from systems sizes @xmath113 and @xmath114 , using two or three independent runs .",
    "starting with both random and ordered initial conditions , the runs last up to 800,000 monte carlo steps .",

    "meanwhile , for @xmath116 $ ] , the behavior is consistent with @xmath109 .",
    "these preliminary results lead us to conjecture the existence of a `` stringy phase '' , especially in the thermodynamic limit of square ( @xmath117 ) lattices .",
    "of course , simulations with larger @xmath110 s will be needed to determine if the increasing behavior persists .",
    "other systematic methods can also be brought to bear , such as distribution functions of both @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we have initiated a study of the histograms of @xmath120 for a range of low lying wave - vectors , using the time - series of each quantity .",
    "preliminary data show remarkable structures which are being verified in longer runs .",
    "attempts at a theoretical understanding , based on phenomenological approaches , of the nature of the `` stringy phase '' are in progress .",
    "in this brief article , we highlighted several major differences between a system in thermal equilibrium and one in non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "apart from the obvious presence of non - trivial energy fluxes , the latter systems display many distinguishing and surprising features .",
    "since their stationary distributions are neither _ a priori _ known nor susceptible to analytic probes ( except for some simple limits or 1-d cases ) , all efforts to uncover the macroscopic , collective properties of these systems are based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "focusing on a particularly simple model  the ising lattice gas , driven into non - equilibrium steady states by an external `` electric '' field@xcite , we gave a brief review of a variety of surprising and counter - intuitive behavior .",
    "in the last section , we offered two of the recent developments in this continuing saga : detailed investigations of the energy flux and preliminary studies indicating the possible existence of a new phase ( especially for systems with large anisotropies in the attractive interactions ) . beyond this simple model ,",
    "many generalizations have been explored .",
    "examples include repulsive interactions , random drives , quenched random impurities , multilayers , and multispecies , to name but a few @xcite .",
    "further from this class of `` driven diffusive systems '' is a wide range of other non - equilibrium steady states , e.g. , surface growth , electrophoresis and sedimentation , granular and traffic flow , biological and geological systems , etc .",
    "all of these offer further surprises , some understood and most unexplained . at present , each non - equilibrium system is studied independently from the others .",
    "the hope is that a unifying concept and framework , like the fundamental hypothesis or the boltzmann factor , will be discovered before the next centennial meeting of the aps .",
