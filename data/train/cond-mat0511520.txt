    "in 1974 kramer and pesch theoretically discovered an unusual core shrinkage of an isolated vortex for decreasing temperature which they did not only observe in numerical solutions of eilenberger s equations but also proved analytically @xcite .",
    "while all other lengthscales describing the superconducting state , especially the london penetration depth and the coherence length , reach a saturation value with decreasing temperature , this investigation introduced a new lengthscale in the discussion of the vortex state of clean superconductors .",
    "it can be defined as the inverse of the slope of the pairing potential at the vortex center and describes not only the spatial variation of the gap function but also the maximum height of the supercurrent density around the vortex center and thus measures the size of the vortex core . in a clean superconductor without impurity scattering",
    "this length @xmath2 decreases linearly with temperature tending to zero for @xmath0 while in superconductors with larger scattering rates it reaches a saturation value .",
    "a detailed study of the impurity effect on the vortex core shrinkage can be found in ref .",

    "it appears well established both experimentally and theoretically that the new superconductor mgb@xmath1 is a two gap superconductor , possessing two superconducting gaps of significantly different size on disconnected parts of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "there exist other compounds , in which two gap superconductivity is believed to be realized , however , at present mgb@xmath1 is the clearest example . in the case of such a multi band superconductor with several distinct gap values there",
    "exist different lengthscales that describe the spatial variation of the quasiparticle excitations corresponding to the different gap values .",
    "therefore , we also expect different lengthscales for the description of the increase of the gap functions near the center of an isolated vortex in each band .",
    "it is obvious that these lengthscales are not independent of each other if there is a coupling of the different bands via the pairing interaction . in this work",

    "we also present an analytical gap model that well describes the low temperature behaviour of the core size @xmath2 . in the last section",
    "we want to discuss a model of a two gap superconductor assuming large and small scattering rates in the different bands and its influence on the size of the vortex core .",
    "in this section , we study the vortex core structure of a standard ( single band ) superconductor . in the first subsection ( [ sub : numcalc1 ] ) , we describe how the riccati parametrization formalism of the eilenberger theory can be used to numerically calculate the structure of an isolated abrikosov vortex in the clean limit . in the second subsection ( [ sub : exsol1 ] ) , we present an analytical model for the pairing potential in the vicinity of an isolated abrikosov vortex and explain how it can be used to calculate the temperature dependence of the vortex core size . the third subsection ( [ sub : dirtylim1 ] ) applies to the dirty limit .",

    "secondly , the number of terms in the sum over matsubara frequencies @xmath23 grows linearly with decreasing temperature .",
    "thirdly , the averaging over all fermi wave vectors @xmath24 that appear on the fermi surface becomes laborious for complicated fermi surface topologies .",
    "taking all these points into account , it is obvious that an analytical approach should be considered whenever possible , in particular if one wants to study the @xmath0 limit . in the next chapter , this will be done for an isolated abrikosov vortex .      in the innermost part of an abrikosov vortex , the modulus of the pairing potential grows linearly with increasing distance from the vortex center . as it approaches the bulk value , it saturates with a certain profile .",

    "thus , the following simple analytical model for the pairing potential in the vicinity of an isolated abrikosov vortex is useful : @xmath30 here , @xmath31 denotes the value of the pairing potential in the bulk at a given temperature @xmath19 ; @xmath2 is the lengthscale on which the pairing potential rises from zero in the center of the vortex to the bulk value @xmath31 and coincides with the previous definition ( [ eq : defxiv ] ) . according to ref .",

    "hence , one has to introduce two lengthscales , one for each of the two bands : @xmath145 and @xmath146 . following the discussion in section ( [ sub : numcalc2 ] ) , the calculations carried out in chapter ( [ sub : exsol1 ] ) have then to be repeated for each of the two bands separately in order to obtain the quasiclassical green s function for both bands : @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "a coupling of the two bands first occurs in the gap equation ( [ eq : gapeq2b ] ) .    in full analogy to the procedure in chapter ( [ sub : exsol1 ] )",
    ", the green s function @xmath5 can be calculated for each of the two bands . the two band gap equation ( [ eq : gapeq2b ] )",
    "can again be differentiated at the center of the vortex @xmath73 with respect to the position @xmath67 and determines the two lengthscales @xmath145 and @xmath146 for the full temperature range : @xmath147    in fig .",
    "[ cap : res2b ] , we show the results from these calculations , again compared to the results from a fully self - consistent solution of the two band gap equation . as in the single gap case , the linear profile for the pairing potential results in a qualitatively correct behaviour of @xmath148 and @xmath149 for the full temperature range . the lengthscales @xmath145 and @xmath146 diverge for @xmath80 and vanish for @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we find a kramer - pesch effect in both bands of a clean two band system .",
    "again , for low temperatures the linear profile matches nicely the self - consistently calculated curve but shows deviations for higher temperatures . + as in the single band case , the lengthscales @xmath145 and @xmath146 bend towards @xmath150 not until very low temperatures ( @xmath86 ) and thus one should again be careful with extrapolations from higher temperatures towards @xmath87 ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "cap : res2b ] ) .",
    "we also show the comparison with a dirty limit calculation of the two band gap equation using the usadel formalism introduced in section ( [ sub : dirtylim1 ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ cap : dirtylim2b ] . in this case",
    "we used slightly different parameters to calculate the coupling matrix @xmath119 than in the clean limit calculations . for the ratio of the diffusion constants we have chosen the value proposed by koshelev and golubov in @xcite as @xmath151 leading to a ratio of the coherence lengths to be @xmath152 .",
    "as expected , we find a finite core size for both bands even for low temperatures and thus , as in the single gap case , no kramer - pesch effect exists in the dirty limit .    in order to compare the behaviour of the two bands ,",
    "it is useful to study the ratio @xmath153 . in fig .",
    "[ cap : ratio2b ] , we show this ratio for the clean and the dirty limit .",
    "the clean limit results were obtained , on the one hand , from a numerical solution of the gap equation and , on the other hand , from the analytical model for the pairing potential .",
    "the dirty limit results stem from calculations within the usadel formalism . for high temperatures ( @xmath80 ) , both @xmath146 and @xmath145 diverge and the ratio @xmath153 tends to @xmath154 in the clean as well as in the dirty limit . for low temperatures ( @xmath82 ) ,",
    "the clean and the dirty limit results differ greatly . in the clean limit , both",
    "lengthscales vanish , however , in a way that leads to a strong growth of the ratio @xmath153 , i.e. the vortex core size in the @xmath117 band decreases more slowly as a function of temperature than the one in the @xmath116 band .",
    "the agreement between the numerical results and those from the linear profile is very good here . in the dirty limit",
    ", the saturation of both @xmath146 and @xmath145 leads to a saturation of the ratio @xmath153 .",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum for two dirty bands is a simple superposition of two single band spectra as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cap : ldos2busadelusadel ] .",
    "in present high - quality samples of mgb@xmath115 it is believed that the intraband scattering rate in the @xmath116 bands is smaller than the gap value , while in the @xmath117 bands the intraband scattering rate is larger than the corresponding gap value @xcite .",
    "therefore we want to discuss in this section  as first suggested by m.  eschrig @xcite  a model with a clean @xmath116 band and a dirty @xmath117 band .",
    "since the gap profiles in the two bands can not vary independently as they are coupled via the gap equation , we expect that for low temperatures they show the same asymptotic behaviour .",
    "but it is not at all clear if we find a decrease of @xmath145 and @xmath146 for @xmath0 as in the clean limit calculations or a saturation value as in the dirty limit approach . to obtain a result for the two vortex core radii we have to solve the two band gap equation ( [ eq : gapeq2b ] ) where we calculate @xmath155 from the riccati amplitudes @xmath156 and @xmath157 according to ( [ eq : propf ] ) , while the fermi surface averaged green s function @xmath158",
    "is replaced by the usadel green s function @xmath159 that is a solution of a simple boundary value problem as described in section ( [ sub : dirtylim1 ] ) .",
    "since we have two different lengthscales in the clean and the dirty band case @xmath160 and @xmath161 we have to fix the ratio of the two coherence lengths which in general will depend on the sample quality , i.e. the scattering rate in the @xmath117 band .",
    "assuming the diffusion constant @xmath162 to be of the order of @xmath163 we chose the ratio to be @xmath164 .",
    "we do not expect the essential qualitative results to depend on the special value of this ratio which we have checked numerically for a different ratio . in fig .",
    "[ cap : mixed_model_results ] we show the numerical results of this calculation . in our calculation",
    "we find a distinct decrease of the vortex core size for low temperatures even in the dirty @xmath117 band , that can be understood as an induced kramer - pesch effect due to the real space coupling of the two gap amplitudes via the gap equation .",
    "the influence of the dirty @xmath117 band is reflected in a larger ratio of @xmath153 for low temperatures than in the pure clean limit or the pure dirty limit approach .    in fig .",
    "[ cap : ldos2busadel ] , we show the quasiparticle spectrum for the mixed model , consisting of a clean @xmath116 band and a dirty @xmath117 band . looking at the @xmath116 and @xmath117 band spectra individually , it is obvious that the zero energy bound state only exists in the clean band .",
    "thus , a zero energy peak is visible in the total quasiparticle spectrum , but it is lifted by an offset due to the flat spectrum of the dirty band . restricting to the vortex core region , this leads to a picture that is very similar to the clean single band case .",
    "we have studied the kramer - pesch effect in both a single gap and a two gap superconductor using parameters relevant for mgb@xmath1 . we have presented a model for the vortex core that allows an analytical solution for the riccati equations in both cases and compared it with fully self - consistent numerical solutions .",
    "this model is useful for approximate calculations , in particular at low temperatures .    in the two gap case",
    "we find that the kramer - pesch effect is present in both bands in the clean limit . at high temperatures the sizes of the two components of the vortex core become equal , while at low temperatures the size of the vortex core in the @xmath117 band with the smaller gap decreases more slowly with decreasing temperature .",
    "we also investigated the dirty limit within the framework of the usadel equations . in a single band superconductor",
    "there is no kramer - pesch effect in the dirty limit as has been discussed before @xcite .",
    "however , in a two gap superconductor an interesting new situation arises , when one band is in the clean limit while the other is in the dirty limit , as is believed to be the case in high quality mgb@xmath1 samples . in this particular case",
    "we find that even in the dirty band a kramer - pesch effect exists , induced by the clean band .",
    "traditionally the kramer - pesch effect is difficult to observe experimentally due to the disturbing effect of impurities .",
    "our calculations indicate that there is a better chance of observing this effect in mgb@xmath1 by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) imaging of the vortex core as a function of temperature , because the @xmath117 band may be in the dirty limit and still showing a decreasing vortex core size with decreasing temperature , as seen in fig .",
