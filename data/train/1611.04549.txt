    "the axion is a hypothetical low - mass boson which emerges as a consequence of the peccei ",
    "quinn ( pq ) mechanism , which explains the absence of cp - violating effects in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "axions are attractive candidates for cold dark matter ( dm ) as they are produced non - thermally in the early universe .",
    "there are two classes of axion dm scenarios : the pq symmetry is broken before inflation and either ( i )  never restored thereafter or ( ii )  restored during reheating , subsequently breaking again . in scenario  ( i ) , axion dm is produced through the re - alignment mechanism with a dependence on one common initial misalignment angle @xmath4 in the observable universe .",
    "a wide axion mass range can be made to agree with the observed dm density as @xmath4 is a free parameter , though values around @xmath5ev corresponding to @xmath61 are considered to be most natural . in scenario",
    "( ii ) , the observable universe contains many patches with different @xmath4 values , whose average fixes the axion dm contribution from the re - alignment mechanism . with additional contributions from decays of axion strings and domain walls , an agreement with the dm density",
    "is found in the ` high - mass ' region around @xmath7ev  @xcite .",
    "most efforts for detecting dm axions , notably the admx and admx - hf experiments @xcite , focus on @xmath8  @xmath0ev .",
    "these experiments rely on the resonant enhancement by a cavity to boost the axion - photon conversion in a magnetic field and so gain sensitivity to axion dm . as resonant cavities are most effective for @xmath9 of @xmath10ev , a cavity - based search for axion",
    "dm in the 100  @xmath0ev range seems to be highly challenging .",
    "new methods are needed to cover this 100  @xmath0ev region .",

    "right : conceptual idea of a dielectric haloscope to search for dm axions with @xmath7ev.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "to scan the @xmath12ev range , we exploit a novel dielectric haloscope approach derived from the concepts described in  @xcite .",
    "the expected axion - induced radiation power density at a transition between materials with different dielectric constant @xmath13 in a magnetic field is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the surface area , @xmath16 the magnetic field parallel to the surface , and @xmath17 an @xmath18 constant quantifying the model - dependence of the axion - photon coupling @xmath19 )  @xcite , with the fine - structure constant @xmath20 and the pq breaking scale @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is a function depending on the dielectric constants of the two media . for a metallic mirror in vacuum @xmath23",
    "@xcite .",
    "r0.5        to obtain a detectable power of @xmath24w , one would need a mirror with an area of @xmath25 m@xmath26 magnetized with a 10  t field parallel to its surface , which is not possible with current technology . instead , we propose building a dielectric haloscope : a series of @xmath27 high-@xmath13 material discs with @xmath28  m@xmath26 placed in front of a metallic mirror of the same area , contained in a @xmath29  10  t magnetic field . unlike a traditional resonant cavity ,",
    "this device is open on one side to facilitate broadband searches .",
    "one can adjust the spacings between the discs to achieve constructive interference , leading to to a significant boost of the expected axion - induced power @xmath30 over a sizeable bandwidth .",
    "the power boost factor is defined as the power generated in the multi - disc dielectric haloscope normalized to that generated by a single metallic mirror with the same area @xmath28  m@xmath26 .",
    "this factor depends on the frequency @xmath31 , the number of discs @xmath27 , their spacings and their @xmath13 values .",
    "figure  [ fig : boost ] , left , shows the power boost factor as a function of @xmath32 , generated by electromagnetic ( em ) simulations for a setup consisting of @xmath33  discs made from laalo@xmath11 ( @xmath34 ) : factors  @xmath35 within a bandwidth of 250  mhz can be achieved .",
    "moreover , the frequency range with a sizeable power boost can be seamlessly shifted by changing the spacings between the discs .",
    "further investigations using em modelling show that the area under the power boost factor curve as a function of frequency @xmath32 scales linearly with the number of discs @xmath27 .",
    "based on this area law , power boost factors of @xmath36 over a 40mhz wide frequency range seem feasible with @xmath37 discs made from laalo@xmath38 . using discs with a diameter of 1  m in a 10  t dipole field , a total axion - induced power of @xmath39  w",
    "could then be generated in the high - mass region around @xmath7ev .",
    "a sketch of the proposed madmax setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : boost ] , right .",
    "while this is a mechanically challenging setup , it has the advantage of flexibility .",
    "one can adopt a significantly broadband search strategy , probing a large frequency range within a reasonable measurement time .",
    "once the broad bandwidth search leads to evidence for a signal , the dielectric haloscope can be tuned to a higher boost factor across a narrower bandwidth .",
    "this would enhance the signal - to - noise ratio , allowing the fast confirmation of a detection .",
    "one of the big challenges in the experiment will be the availability of a @xmath29  10 t dipole magnet that allows to house @xmath29  1  m diameter discs over a length of up to 2  m. presently two design concepts are under discussion , the canted cosine theta @xcite and the racetrack @xcite designs .",
    "initial investigations indicate that both design concepts are suitable . in the near future",
    "we will see which of these is better suited for the current experimental proposal .",
    "r0.5        to determine the required signal strength , a radiometer based on heterodyne detection using a hemt preamplifier @xcite has been built .",
    "it was used for a first measurement of a weak signal at 20ghz with @xmath40  w at room temperature .",
    "the fake signal was detected within one week measurement time with 6@xmath41 separation from background . according to the data sheet , operating the preamplifier at 4k temperature reduces its noise by another two orders of magnitude allowing for the detection of signals with power of the order of @xmath42  w , if the noise contribution of the haloscope itself is low enough .",
    "as transmissivity and reflectivity of the haloscope are correlated with the boost factor curve , they can be used to verify the simulated boost factor behaviour .",
    "we use this to test our calculations of the boost factor and to potentially aid correct disc placement .",
    "this has been done in the prototype setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seed_setup ] consisting of five sapphire ( al@xmath43o@xmath11 with @xmath44 ) discs with 200 mm diameter each .",
    "discs are positioned by precision motors with a precision of roughly 15@xmath0 m .",
    "the uncertainty on positioning is due to the mechanical setup rather than the limitations of the motors .",
    "a comparison of a transmissivity measurement with simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity_measurements ] . while details of the transmissivity behaviour slightly differ , the general behaviour is encouragingly similar , especially the position of the peak at highest frequencies .",
    "the same has been verified for reflectivity measurements using group delay peaks .",
    "r0.5     [ sec : figures ]    a long term reflectivity measurement using four sapphire discs and a metallic mirror was performed to monitor the stability of the group delay peak .",
    "the variations of the peak position , attributed to mechanical ( vibration ) or thermal ( contraction or expansion ) changes in the setup , are of the order of 1  mhz , substantially narrower than the envisioned bandwidth of the boost factor .",
    "long - term measurements can be performed over a sizeable bandwidth even under these experimental conditions ( without vibrational damping and precise climate control ) .    to estimate the sensitivity of the proposed axion dm search experiment",
    ", we assume a setup consisting of @xmath45 discs with @xmath46  m@xmath26 surface area each , achieving a power boost factor of @xmath47  10@xmath48 over a bandwidth of @xmath49 mhz , and cryogenic preamp with a noise level of 8  k. inside a 10  t dipole magnetic field this would allow for a scanning of the well - motivated qcd axion dm parameter space around @xmath50ev , assuming purely axionic dm , within a few years .",
    "the projected sensitivity is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] .",
    "axions are amongst the best motivated dm candidates , with interesting and unique phenomenology . however , ` high mass ' axions around @xmath51ev that explain the observed dm density in scenarios in which pq symmetry breaking occurs after inflation are beyond the reach of current experiments .",
    "a novel approach to study these axions is a dielectric haloscope that consists of a series of dielectric discs placed in a magnetic field , which can be positioned to enhance the axion - induced em power to a detectable level .",
    "a comparison of simulations with first measurements indicate that this approach could scan the interesting qcd axion dm mass range within a reasonable time span .",
