    "as it was emphasized by brandt and mikitik,@xcite magnetic relaxation in superconductors is not always related to thermally activated flux creep .",
    "thus , one can predict the magnetic moment relaxation induced by perpendicular ac field oscillations , within the critical state framework . recall that such phenomenological approach@xcite describes the zero temperature limit of magnetic flux dynamics in superconductors with pinning .",
    "the basic idea is that a given magnetic source produces some distribution of persistent current densities ( critical currents ) within the sample , determined by the actual excitation process through faraday s law .",
    "essentially , the model in ref . ascribes the magnetic moment relaxation to internal variations of the current density distribution , related to the shaking effect from the transverse ac field .",
    "it is of note that , within such a theory , and depending on the actual conditions of the shaking process , one can either predict relaxation toward the true equilibrium state of the superconductor , or eventual freezing into some metastable configuration .",
    "this feature seems to be tightly linked to the critical state physics .",
    "however , some recent research about crossed field effects in high - t@xmath0 superconductors@xcite has raised doubts about the generality of the complete / incomplete relaxation issues .",
    "dimensionality is a relevant property in the transverse flux phenomenon , because , at least , two component magnetic systems are involved .",
    "then , as it was remarked by brandt and mikitik , the appropriate critical state problem to be considered is , minimally , two dimensional . in their work for thin samples , taking advantage of the smallness of the @xmath1 ratio",
    "a quasi - one - dimensional analysis was given .",
    "namely , they split the problem into two coupled one - dimensional flux pinning statements .    on the other hand , at this point , the reader may recall that critical state models for one - dimensional geometries ( infinite slabs and cylinders ) incorporating transverse flux effects have been issued in different forms.@xcite however , the latter studies refer to magnetic field vectors with mutually perpendicular components , but parallel to the surface of the sample .",
    "this mathematical simplification implies an important physical assumption : the dynamics of transverse flux lines includes cutting effects between them .",
    "clem@xcite has justified that , still , the phenomenon may be treated within the critical state framework .",
    "this is done via the introduction of the so - called parallel ( to @xmath2 ) critical current density @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to the most familiar perpendicular critical current density @xmath4 , which relates to the flux pinning effect,@xcite @xmath3 relates to the maximum angle between flux lines before undergoing a cutting process . it has been shown that a number of experimental observations can be understood within the flux pinning / cutting framework .",
    "these include the so - called _ butterfly _ and _ collapse _ effects in the transverse magnetic moment.@xcite    sketch of the experiment simulated in this work .",
    "an infinite bar of cross section @xmath5 is subjected to the magnetic field excitation shown in the plot .",
    "@xmath6 is initially increased to the value @xmath7 and then @xmath8 is cycled with periodicity @xmath9 and amplitude @xmath10.,width=283 ]    as a breakthrough in the above scenario , vanderbemden _",
    "et al._@xcite have emphasized that , with moderate numerical effort , two - dimensional theories can be used for describing transverse flux effects .",
    "this rules out the necessity of considering either very thin samples or incorporating cutting phenomena .",
    "the modeling is realized by analyzing the evolution of in - plane magnetic fields within the cross section of a superconducting bar .",
    "in fact , it is apparent that the mutually perpendicular flux lines penetrate basically along ( and not across ) each other . within this picture",
    ", one can analyze transverse flux effects only related to the flux pinning mechanism ( the @xmath4 limitation ) .",
    "however , the former investigations were done in a flux creep framework ( power law @xmath11 ) , and for quite specific initial conditions . as a consequence ,",
    "the authors did always observe complete relaxation by transverse shaking . in this work",
    ", we have studied the true critical state limit ( @xmath12 in the above @xmath13 law ) for two - dimensional transverse flux problems under a wide range of conditions . by using this _ ansatz _",
    ", it will be shown that either complete or incomplete flux relaxation may be expected .",
    "the article is organized as follows . first , in sec.[seccritical ]",
    ", we describe the in - plane magnetic flux configurations under study and justify the application of a generalized bean s model for the investigation of such phenomena .",
    "a numerical method , based on the concept of mutual inductance between circuits will be introduced . in sec.[seccrossed ] , a set of numerical results of the actual magnetic flux dynamics in a number of crossed field configurations is presented .",
    "based on the critical current distributions , and also related to the structure of the penetrating field lines , we show the importance of the partial penetration concept in this problem . in close analogy to the _ one dimensional _",
    "critical state problems , increasing the applied magnetic field progressively leads to the disappearance of the flux free region .",
    "sec.[secmagnetic ] is devoted to analyze the relaxation of the magnetic moment , induced by oscillations of transverse magnetic fields",
    ". a systematic study for different amplitudes of the _ polarizing _ dc field , as well as of the _ oscillating _ transverse component is presented . decay to the true equilibrium magnetization is clearly related to the disappearance of the flux free core .",
    "the generality of the above properties is shown by application of the model to samples with inhomogeneities in the cross section .",
    "thus , in sec.[secextensions ] we illustrate the evolution of the magnetic flux structure for samples with non homogeneous critical current density @xmath14 .",
    "the basic configuration considered in the present work is sketched in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "a superconducting bar occupies the region defined by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the external magnetic field will be applied along the @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes .",
    "starting from a zero field configuration , @xmath6 will be ramped to a final amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath8 will be cycled between the values @xmath20 in a linear fashion .",
    "we note that , corresponding to the hypothesis that the lower critical field of the superconductor may be neglected as compared to @xmath10 and @xmath7 , the equality @xmath21 will be used in what follows . in other words ,",
    "the equilibrium magnetization of the sample is approximated by zero .",
    "the starting point for the application of the critical state theory to the above problem is our variational statement@xcite within the @xmath22-formulation.@xcite such a representation in terms of the vector potential and current density allows to include finite size effects in a simple manner , and has been well elaborated in previous work .",
    "the equivalence to the more standard differential equation statements based on the maxwell equations is rigorously justified in ref ..",
    "thus , the quasi - stationary evolution of magnetic processes in a hard superconductor may be obtained from the constrained minimization of the functional @xmath23 & \\nonumber\\\\ & + { \\displaystyle\\frac{8\\pi}{\\mu_{0}}\\int}_{\\!\\!\\omega } \\left ( \\vec{a}_{\\rm e , n+1}-\\vec{a}_{\\rm e , n } \\right)\\cdot\\vec{j}_{\\rm n+1}(\\vec{x})\\ ; . &   % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath24 stands for the current density at the time layer @xmath25 , @xmath26 represents the superconducting region , and @xmath27 means the externally applied vector potential .",
    "minimization is performed iteratively in time with @xmath28 the unknown function for each step .",
    "as regards the constraints , recall that , for the present work , the minimization of @xmath29 under the condition @xmath30 will be equivalent to the flux pinning criterion @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , by symmetry arguments one can show that @xmath32 strictly flows along the bar , i.e. : @xmath33 and then @xmath34 .    on the technical side ,",
    "an important advantage of the above mentioned problem s symmetry is the simplification of the numerical algorithm to be used for solving the variational statement .",
    "thus , one can argue that the current density streamlines may be replaced by a collection of infinite straight wires , and the variational statement can be easily discretized to an algebraic form .",
    "the problem is transformed into the minimization of the quadratic function @xmath35 here , the set of unknowns @xmath36 represents the collection of current lines flowing across the section of the sample , and @xmath37 is their mutual inductance matrix .",
    "minimization will be made under the set of constraints @xmath38 .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is the critical current for an elementary wire , related to the flux pinning current density limitation .",
    "the mutual inductance coefficients will be evaluated from the expressions @xmath40 which one can be obtain for a collection of parallel straight wires of circular cross section ( radius @xmath41).@xcite in summary , the calculation method is as follows .",
    "first , we compute the matrix @xmath37 for a given grid of elements , describing the problem ( most of the examples presented later correspond to the rectangular case of @xmath42 elements ) .",
    "second , we solve the minimization of the function in eq.([eqmij ] ) .",
    "recall that one has @xmath43 variables ( @xmath36 ) constrained by @xmath43 conditions .",
    "this process is done iteratively in time ( @xmath44 ) and one introduces the desired external bias , through the position dependent vector potential . in the case of a uniform field with components @xmath45",
    "one can use the @xmath46component @xmath47 .    finally , we want to mention some additional details that may be of help from the practical point of view . on the one side ,",
    "the further use of symmetry considerations related to the homogeneity of the applied magnetic field is to be advised .",
    "thus , if one considers the rectangular cross section in the inset of fig.[fig1 ] , the inversion property @xmath48 may be recalled .",
    "only one half of the variables have to be accounted for , and the computation simplifies noticeably . on the other hand ,",
    "an important advantage of the preferred @xmath22-formulation is that the physical quantities of interest are obtained by integration of the former .",
    "then , discretization errors are smoothed . on the contrary , if one uses an @xmath49-formulation , @xmath32 is obtained by differentiation and this results in the magnification of errors .",
    "below , we will present the calculated current density distributions and the corresponding magnetic field configurations induced by external excitations in the form illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] . for further analysis",
    ", we have performed calculations for a variety of values of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "both have been allowed to range well above and below the characteristic field @xmath50 , which determines the full penetration regime for @xmath51 along the @xmath18 axis . within the geometry considered in this work ( @xmath52 ) one has@xcite @xmath53 .",

    "the actual structure of critical / subcritical zones within the bar s cross section strongly depends on the @xmath60 process .",
    "below , we describe some systematic properties that have been observed .      in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "we depict the critical current distributions in the initial part of the process illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] . to the upper left",
    "one can find the typical penetration profile for a uniform external field along one of the symmetry axes of the sample ( @xmath61-axis ) . in this case , this has been achieved when the condition @xmath62 is met .",
    "the subsequent pictures correspond to a number of intermediate steps within the first cycle for the @xmath63 component .",
    "this has been also ramped to the amplitude @xmath64 .",
    "the actual orientation of the applied field is indicated by the central vector , that is proportional to @xmath65 within each picture .",
    "notice the similarity between the current free cores within this study and the analytical results in ref . for thin samples in oblique fields .",
    "two facts are noticeable in the evolution of the current density penetration profiles : ( i ) the introduction of @xmath63 induces upper and lower sheets of current , devoted to the shielding of the magnetic field variations , ( ii ) within the chosen range of parameters , one gets a central current free core .",
    "the core is initially distorted by the application of @xmath63 , but rapidly acquires a stationary behavior .",
    "this property is apparent in the lower shots of fig.[fig2 ] , where we display the evolution within the first half of the second cycle in @xmath63 .",
    "recall that one obtains a dynamical structure for the @xmath66 regions , around a stable central core with @xmath67 .      as one could infer from the knowledge of one - dimensional critical state problems",
    ", the subcritical region collapses to zero volume when the applied magnetic field reaches a certain intensity .",

    "the magnetic field lines have been obtained as the contour plots of the function @xmath72 , i.e. : they are given by the condition @xmath73 .",

    "fig.[fig4 ] displays the magnetic field structure corresponding to the transient period in which the central core is established ( upper rows ) .",
    "recall that the magnetic field is excluded from the current free region ( compare to fig.[fig2 ] ) and also the trend of forming a stationary profile , surrounded by regions in which significant variations of the flux structure take place .",
    "thus , in the lower rows , one can already observe that the inner core is unperturbed , while the applied field oscillates in between @xmath75 .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] has been obtained by integration of the current density profiles presented in the previous section , and thus corresponds to the crossed field amplitudes @xmath62 and @xmath64 .      in order to have a more systematic information about the partial penetration regime in 2d problems with crossed magnetic fields , we have studied the formation of the flux free core in different conditions .",
    "thus , fig.[fig5 ] displays the stationary core that is obtained when one uses an oscillating field amplitude @xmath64 , for initial ramps with either @xmath76 or @xmath62 respectively .",
    "the behavior for other values has been also studied , and the results ( not shown for brevity ) do not display significant differences .    for the sake of clarity , in the plots , we have only shown the lowest level magnetic field lines that define the core , and their evolution as @xmath63 is cycled within the stationary regime .",
    "notice that the boundary of the core remains unchanged , while the flux lines adapt to the applied field as one moves away from the center of the sample .",
    "the only difference between the two situations is the actual size of the core .",
    "as one can deduce from the results in the following section , this is straightforwardly related to the saturation value @xmath77 acquired by the vertical magnetic moment .      as it was shown above ( sec.[seccurrfull ] ) , the current free core disappears when one uses the external conditions @xmath62 and @xmath71 .",
    "here we show the flux line structure corresponding to the oscillations of @xmath63 in such a range .",
    "as one can see in fig.[fig6 ] , magnetic flux has fully penetrated the sample .",

    "when plotted against this quantity @xmath81 reaches a stationary bean s like loop after an initial transient in which the loop does not close .",

    "is characterized by a saturation of @xmath88 , which relates to a stationary @xmath89 loop , in the typical form of 1d problems , when the full penetration regime is reached .",
    "the properties of @xmath77 are of special mention , since we have found less common features .",
    "firstly , we outline the step - like behavior in the plot @xmath90 .",
    "note that the descent of this quantity , induced by the oscillation of @xmath63 , presents a series of _ plateaus _ that are precisely triggered by the return points in @xmath75 .",
    "this fact is also apparent within the @xmath91 plot , and was mentioned before in ref . , where a power law @xmath13 model and the _ high field _ region ( full penetration ) were considered . recall that here , we also obtain the steps for the low field region .",
    "nevertheless , the early saturation of @xmath77 makes the effect less visible in such cases .",
    "we want to stress the high similarity of our plot @xmath90 and fig.2 in ref .. thus , the main feature of both graphs is the separation of complete and incomplete relaxation when the value of @xmath83 approaches one in units of @xmath50 . on the other side ,",
    "recall that the step - like behavior in our plot would be smeared out over a time scale comparable to the one used by the authors in ref .. in fact , if one takes the time unit as @xmath92 , the approximation for very thin samples used by brandt and mikitik leads to @xmath93 , while in our case ( @xmath52 ) we have @xmath94 .",
    "next , we analyze the relevance of the initial @xmath95 ramp on the subsequent complete or incomplete relaxation of @xmath82 during the @xmath63 cycles . the main results for this study are plotted in fig.[fig8 ] .",

    "however , the separation between the values of @xmath98 first increases , and then decreases , going to zero when the complete relaxation is reached ; ( ii ) on the other side , crossings between the values of the normalized magnetization are observed during the initial transient evolution . the importance of these crossings increases as the value of @xmath70 does .",

    "first , we calculate the evolution of the magnetic field profiles for a sample with a central hole , when subjected to the process in fig.[fig1 ] .",

    ", some recent papers@xcite have considered the importance of transverse flux effects .",
    "of particular interest is the magnetization decay induced by the oscillations of a perpendicular magnetic field . in this work ,",
    "we have tried to clarify some questions about the ability of phenomenological flux pinning models for describing the experimental observations . in particular , we have addressed the debate about the existence of complete and incomplete relaxation regimes ( full decay or not into the equilibrium magnetization ) in terms of the actual transverse shaking process .",
    "we have shown that , within the critical state model for flux pinning , the kind of relaxation is related to the existence of a flux free core within the sample .",
    "thus , under certain conditions ( small enough amplitudes of the applied field components ) one finds a transient regime in which the central flux free core changes its shape until a stationary profile is reached .",
    "afterwards , the transverse field shaking produces the swing of the flux lines around the frozen core structure , and the magnetic moment becomes constant ( but not zero ) .",
    "if the amplitude of the applied magnetic field increases enough , the flux free core shrinks to null volume , and the stationary magnetic moment becomes zero .",

    "is a good approximation for thin strips , which are nothing but a limiting case of the 2d problem . on the other hand ,",
    "it is of mention that a fundamental ingredient of ref .",
    "is the idea that flux lines _ walk _ towards the center of the sample ( @xmath106 ) , pivoting around the so - called _",
    "swivel points_. switching from one swivel point to the next is done every half - cycle . in the present work ,",
    "we have merely used the concept of a maximum pinning force ( introduced by the phenomenological parameter @xmath4 , through the restriction @xmath31 in the variational solution of maxwell equations ) .",
    "remarkably , the evolution of flux lines in our model follows the walking pattern introduced by brandt and mikitik .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "starting from the magnetic field profiles related to the process in fig.[fig6 ] , we have plotted a sequence of pictures , corresponding to a specific flux line , along the first cycle .",
    "it is apparent that two swivel points are formed ( labeled @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , which establish the shift from position @xmath109 to @xmath110 , by two rotations .",
    "the switch from the pivot @xmath107 to @xmath108 is clearly established by the return point @xmath111 ( step @xmath112 to @xmath113 ) .",
    "we want to note that the vertical position of the swivel points has changed .",
    "another point to consider is the role of the aspect ratio parameter @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the main difference between the predicted magnetization decay , that is , the step - like structure in our figs.[fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] disappears when the physical time unit @xmath115 is taken into account .",

    "<S> we show that , based on the critical state model for flux - line pinning in hard superconductors , one can assess the magnetic moment relaxation induced by the oscillations of a perpendicular magnetic field . </S>",

    "<S> stationary regimes with either saturation to metastable configurations , or complete decay to the thermodynamic equilibrium are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between both types of response is related to the disappearance of a flux free core within the sample . as a common feature , a step - like dependence in the time relaxation </S>",

    "<S> the theory may be applied to long bars of arbitrary and non homogeneous cross section , under in - plane magnetic field processes . </S>"
