    "this report is based on a talk , presented at dis2000 in liverpool , with the purpose to summarize shortly the legacy of hera during the first decade of its operation .",
    "the talk was given to an audience working in the field .",
    "for the benefit of the reader who is less familiar with the subject , the proceedings version has been extended to include an appendix with definitions of the kinematical variables used in the text .",
    "the main motivation for building the hera @xmath0 collider was to continue and study the inner structure of matter and the nature of forces in a way similar to that of rutherford , by probing the proton with higher and higher gauge - boson virtuality , @xmath1 , in order to resolve smaller and smaller distances .",
    "this way of probing the proton is known as deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "the plane showing the fraction of the proton s momentum carried by the probed parton , @xmath2 , and the virtuality @xmath1 of the probing photon , is shown in figure  [ fig : x - q2 ] and is impressive .",
    "it shows how hera has extended the kinematic reach in both direction in @xmath1 , low and high , and in the low @xmath2 region , by few orders of magnitude .",
    "before this talk , i polled the view of several eminent people as to what they consider to be the highlights of hera so far .",
    "all of them unanimously put as number one the surprising sharp rise of @xmath3 with decreasing @xmath2  @xcite , an example of which is shown in figure  [ fig : f2-q2 - 15 ] .",
    "the dglap evolution equations predict the rise of the parton distributions with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "why is then the observed rise so surprising ?",
    "the physical quantity which is measured is @xmath3 . to decompose @xmath3 into quarks , we need the ` impulse approximation ' to be valid .",
    "this means that the configuration of the fock states into which the proton fluctuates has to be frozen during the interaction time .",
    "this condition leads  @xcite to a relation between the @xmath1 of the probing photon and some other scales like quark masses , @xmath4 , quark transverse momentum @xmath5 s and @xmath2 .",
    "the fluctuation time , @xmath6 , is inversely proportional to the mass squared of the probed configuration , @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction time , @xmath8 , is inversely proportional to the photon virtuality , @xmath9 .",
    "the freezing condition for the use of impulse approximation requires @xmath10 or , @xmath11 it is therefore highly non trivial that at very low @xmath2 the expectations of the dglap evolution equations , which apply to partons , remain valid for @xmath3 .",
    "however , hera teaches us that at @xmath12 the impulse approximation may be valid down to @xmath13 1.5 gev@xmath14 . as a summary of this point",
    "i would like to quote peter landshoff : _ the amazing discovery of hera is the rapid rise of @xmath3 at small @xmath2 .",
    "this remains a challenge for theory : there is no respectable theoretical understanding . _",
    "the second subject , unanimously acclaimed as highlight , is the observation of abundant diffraction in dis  @xcite .",
    "this came as a surprise because if @xmath3 is an incoherent sum of quarks , a dis process on a quark can not be diffractive because of color .",
    "a diffractive dis reaction could happen only if the fock state of the proton at the origin includes colorless objects .",
    "if this were indeed the case , one would expect that diffractive dis processes would be soft in nature , contrary to the accumulated evidence .",
    "one of the most striking behaviour of these large rapidity gap events is that they have a similar energy behaviour as that of the total inclusive cross section  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : diff / tot ] , not expected in soft processes .",
    "does that mean that these diffractive dis processes are all hard ?",
    "when one thinks about a dis process involving partons , the first intuition is to think of it as a hard process .",
    "this however turns out not to be the case .",
    "the best way to understand this is when the interaction is viewed in the proton rest frame .",
    "the photon fluctuates into a @xmath15 pair , which can either be a large spatial configuration , or a small one .",
    "the aligned jet model of bjorken  @xcite , leading to scaling properties of @xmath3 , assumes that only large configurations contribute to dis cross section .",
    "that would make dis a predominantly soft process .",
    "the small configurations lead to scaling violation , as expected in qcd . to the extend to which scaling violation introduces only logarithmic corrections to scaling ,",
    "one is led to conclude that , even within qcd , dis is indeed predominantly soft . to me , it came as a cultural shocks to learn that dis does not necessarily mean a hard process .      to confirm the validity of the picture above",
    ", we would like to isolate events in which we know that the photon predominantly fluctuates into a small configuration .",
    "this is achieved either by studying events initiated by longitudinal photons ( @xmath16 ) and looking at the behaviour of @xmath17 , or by studying exclusive vector meson electroproduction and deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "since , unfortunately , we did not measure the ratio @xmath18 of the longitudinal to transverse cross sections at hera , i used as an exercise the parameterization of @xmath19 by badelek , kwiecinski and stasto  @xcite together with that of allm97  @xcite as a good representation of @xmath20 , to calculate the effective @xmath21 energy dependence of the cross section of @xmath17 and @xmath22 separately , assuming a @xmath23 dependence .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : sigl ] .",
    "as one sees , @xmath17 has a very steep rise with @xmath1 , as expected from a small configuration process , reaching the value of 0.5 at @xmath13 1000 gev@xmath14 .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section for photoproduction of vector mesons  @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : xsect - vm ] , indeed confirmed that when the photon is squeezed into a small size , there is a definite change in the @xmath24 behaviour , as expected from pqcd , which connects the @xmath24 behaviour with the rise of the gluons .    in the case of @xmath25",
    "this happens already at @xmath1=0 , due to the presence of the charm quarks .",
    "for the lighter vector mesons , it happens around @xmath1=10 gev@xmath14 , as seen from the @xmath26 ratio  @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : phi / rho ] , and which reaches the expected value of 2/9 at that @xmath1 .",
    "the other property of hard exclusive processes is the universal slope of the diffractive peak . in regge language",
    "this means a decreasing slope @xmath27 of the regge trajectory .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : a - vector ] where the pomeron trajectory is presented as obtained from elastic photoproduction of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "one sees a clear flattening in case of the @xmath25 .",
    "the inclusive diffraction structure function  @xcite , presented in figure  [ fig : diff ] shows a very different behaviour from that of the proton structure function  @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : sc - viol ] .",
    "while the proton structure function shows positive scaling violation at low @xmath2 and negative one at high @xmath2 , the diffractive structure function shows practically only positive scaling violation , and may reach scaling at a large values of @xmath30 .",
    "qcd factorization was proven to hold also in the inclusive diffraction case and thus dglap evolution equations could be applied .",
    "however it turned out that for the evolution equations to be able to describe the @xmath1 behaviour of the data , a large diffractive gluon component is required  @xcite .",
    "this brings me to talk about the gluon in the proton . what have we learned about the gluon ?",
    "from the scaling violation , using the impressive measurements at hera , shown in figure  [ fig : sc - viol ] , the precision of the gluon determination has improved tremendously , as shown in figure  [ fig : gluon - h1 ]  @xcite .",
    "the direct gluon determination from charm production is in very good agreement with the indirect ones from scaling violation . however , when trying to stretch the evolution equations down to low @xmath1 ,",
    "as presented in figure  [ fig : gluon - z ] for @xmath1 = 1 gev@xmath14 , one finds a strange behaviour of the gluon at low @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "what is this strange behaviour of the gluons at low @xmath2 and low @xmath1 tell us ? if anything strange is happening , the gluons will feel it first because of the 9/4 color factor : @xmath31 .",
    "one can calculate the probability @xmath32 that an interaction on the gluon is associated with diffraction .",
    "for a value of @xmath1=4.5gev@xmath14 and @xmath33 this comes out to be @xmath340.4  @xcite , which is very close to the black disc limit of 0.5 .",
    "does this mean that we see some kind of saturation ( unitarity effects ) ?",
    "such saturation effects could lead to the suppression of large @xmath15 configuration and lead to the breakdown of dglap evolution in this region .",
    "this can in fact be nicely observed when @xmath3 is plotted as function of @xmath1 for fixed @xmath35  @xcite , displayed in figure  [ fig : f2-lowq2 ] , where one sees the approximate scaling down to @xmath13 2 gev@xmath14 and then the @xmath36 decrease of @xmath3 towards the low @xmath1 region .",
    "this behaviour , and also that of the caldwell plot  @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : caldwell ] , are well described by the saturation model of golec - biernat and wuesthoff  @xcite .",
    "this section can be summarized by a quotation from al mueller s message : _ the turnover at small @xmath1 ( and small @xmath2 ) along with the success of the golec - biernat wuesthoff model in describing that turnover ( along with diffractive scattering ) suggest that unitarity limits have been reached when @xmath37 1 - 2 gev@xmath14 in the low @xmath2 region at hera . in parton language",
    "this is saturation in the small @xmath2 wave function of the proton . _",
    "hera , the machine designed to teach us about the proton , turned out to be a good tool for studying the structure of both the real and the virtual photon .",
    "a clear two component structure of the real photon has been observed at hera  @xcite .",
    "the gluon distribution in the photon has been extracted and also shows a rise with decreasing @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "hera thus provides an alternative way to that of the @xmath38 collider to measure the photon structure function and to extract parton distributions in the photon .    studies of these type in the dis regime showed that also a virtual photon can have a two component structure at low @xmath2 even at virtualities as high as @xmath13 50 gev@xmath14  @xcite .",
    "this of course raises the question : is the virtual photon probing the structure of the proton or are the partons from the proton probing the structure of the photon ? who is probing whom ?",
    "in fact , in the proton rest frame @xmath2 can be given a spatial meaning : the coherence length can be written as @xmath39 which in the low @xmath2 region can be very large , much larger than the radius of the proton .",
    "thus at low @xmath2 we are actually not studying the structure of the proton . to put it in bjorken s words :",
    "_ the important spacetime regions are neither in the valence region of the hadron nor in the `` valence '' region of the photon probed . _ at low @xmath2",
    "we are probing the structure of the vacuum .",
    "the subject of the very large @xmath1 region  @xcite actually belongs to the future legacy of hera , which the hera upgrade will produce .",
    "so far it produced a text - book result showing that the cross section of nc and cc reactions meet at @xmath40 .",
    "recently , the higher statistics data also showed clearly the effect of the electroweak interference and the first measurements of @xmath41 were obtained .",
    "searches for deviation from the sm caused excitement .",
    "limits on exotic processes were obtained and await higher luminosity data .",
    "our discussion in the previous section clearly indicates that in order to study the interior of the proton , one needs not only to go to higher values of @xmath1 but also to @xmath2 values in excess of 0.1 .",
    "the hera upgrade should provide the luminosity necessary for obtaining high enough statistics in the high @xmath1 high @xmath2 region .",
    "the sharp rise of @xmath3 with decreasing @xmath2 , the diffraction in dis , should we have been surprised ?",
    "some say yes , some say - in retrospect- no . the fact , however , is that we were surprised and unprepared .",
    "the original design of the detectors was not really well suited for the low @xmath2 , low @xmath1 physics .",
    "none of the dis mc generators had diffractive processes .",
    "we also took seriously parton distributions which predicted a flat @xmath3 at low @xmath2 .    to summarize the lesson learned from the low @xmath2 physics at hera",
    ", we have observed a tremendous progress in understanding of qcd dynamics for high energy interactions and we might be faced with the existence of a new qcd regime with high parton densities .",
    "another legacy of hera was pointed out by james stirling : _ studying qcd at hera has given us great confidence that we can very precisely predict lhc cross sections .",
    "indeed , it is under active consideration to use standard model @xmath42 cross sections to measure the lhc luminosity , and it is only because the proton structure is pinned down so well by hera that we can trust the theoretical calculations . _    hera has actually elevated qcd almost to the status of qed , in the sense that qed processes are used to measure luminosities at hera . not that there were doubts in the correctness of qcd .",
    "however , qcd is a complicated theory , and thus we can say that hera in the year 2000 is a glorious triumph of minds dealing with qcd .",
    "did we however get a better picture of the proton ?",
    "rutherford s experiment allowed him to say that most of the atom is empty with a nucleus at its center .",
    "how do we see the proton ? some describe the proton as being a thompson like proton : soup of gluons filled with pointlike quark raisins. other see it as a rutherford like proton : 3 centers of pointlike parton clouds . asking lonya frankfurt ,",
    "his reply was that the outer 20% of the proton is a pion cloud , while nothing is known about the inner 80% .",
    "maria krawczyk brought to my attention the view of altarelli , cabbibo , maiani and petronzio  @xcite , who view the proton as 3 constituent quarks , each of which is a complex object made out of pointlike partons . where are all these partons located in the proton ?",
    "it would be nice to be able to stand in front of a class and tell the students , just as rutherford did about the atom , how the proton looks like .",
    "the hera upgrade program will hopefully give us the answer .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of this workshop , headed by john dainton and josephine zilberkweit , who did a marvelous job .",
    "thanks also for the lord mayor of liverpool , councillor edwin clein , who promised us that in liverpool all our dreams come true , and to the member of parliament for the liverpool riverside constituency , mrs .",

    "a diagram describing a dis process on a proton is shown in figure  [ fig : kinematics ] . a lepton with mass @xmath43 and four - vector @xmath44 interacts with a proton with mass @xmath45 and four - vector @xmath46 through the exchange of a gauge vector boson , which can be @xmath47 , @xmath48 or @xmath49 , depending on the circumstances .",

    ", the exchanged boson can be either a virtual photon @xmath60 , if @xmath1 is not very large and then the reaction is dominantly electromagnetic , or can be a @xmath48 which dominates the reaction at high enough @xmath1 values and the process is dominated by weak forces . in case of the cc dis reactions , only the weak forces are present and the exchange bosons are the @xmath49 .",
