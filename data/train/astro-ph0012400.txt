    "measuring both the mass ( @xmath6 ) and the radius ( @xmath7 ) of a neutron star ( ns ) would strongly constrain the nuclear equation of state . to distinguish between the competing models ,",
    "several measurements of a few percent accuracy in @xmath6 and @xmath7 are required .",
    "while the masses of several nss have been constrained to 10% or better ( see for a recent review ) from pulsar timing of doppler shifts , measuring the ns radii has proven to be difficult .",
    "there are at least five ways to measure @xmath7 using x - ray emission from accreting nss : ( 1 ) the spectral evolution of radius - expansion type - i x - ray bursts ; ( 2 ) the measurements of @xmath8 from the gravitational red - shift of metallic spectral lines during type i x - ray bursts or @xmath9-ray lines during accretion ; ( 3 ) inferring constraints from ns khz quasi - periodic oscillations ; ( 4 ) pressure broadening and red - shift of photospheric metal lines ; and ( 5 ) spectral analysis of transiently accreting nss in quiescence .    efforts to measure the ns radius through the spectral evolution of radius - expansion type - i x - ray bursts ( for a review ,",
    "see ) based on theoretical non - planckian spectra @xcite have been somewhat successful .",
    "performing this measurement with the emission from a type - i x - ray burst has the advantage that the observed luminosity originates from the ns photosphere and not the surrounding accretion disk . the measured ns radii range from 6 to 15 km .",
    "the reliability of these measurements is limited by systematic uncertainties in the emergent spectrum , the fraction of the ns surface area involved in the burst and the elemental composition of the photosphere , as well as the distance to the ns @xcite .",
    "attempts to measure ns photospheric metal lines as expected from model atmospheres @xcite have had mixed success .",
    "absorption lines observed in the tails of type - i x - ray bursts @xcite have not been confirmed through repeated observation with more sensitive instrumentation , resulting in metallicity limits of @xmath10@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of these lines as due to absorption in the photosphere is in doubt @xcite .",
    "repeated observations of such lines , and their identification with a known transition would measure @xmath8 .",
    "gamma - ray lines from the accretion process are also a possibility @xcite , though the levels of emission are still below the ability of current instruments .",
    "observations of kilo - hz quasi - periodic oscillations from accreting neutron stars , interpreted as the orbital period at or above the marginally stable orbit @xcite have been used to constrain both @xmath6 and @xmath7 using observations from eight accreting neutron stars , finding @xmath122@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the ns radius is then less than the marginally stable orbit for a mass of this size ( @xmath1418 km for a non - rotating star ) .",
    "another method of measuring @xmath7 for a slowly rotating ns is the approach described by paerels @xcite , with metal lines from an emergent ns x - ray spectrum .",
    "measuring the pressure broadening ( @xmath15 ) and photospheric red - shift ( @xmath16 ) yields both @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this method is intriguing because it is _ independent of distance _",
    ", which can be uncertain by up to a factor of 2 in the isolated transient nss , although it can be determined to @xmath175% for the low - luminosity x - ray sources in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "once several metal lines are identified in the photospheric spectrum , this method is very likely to provide a number of @xmath6 and @xmath7 measurements .    to these approaches",
    "has recently been added a new means of measuring @xmath7 with x - ray spectroscopic observations of transiently accreting , low magnetic - field ( @xmath14 g ) nss in quiescence @xcite . until this work",

    "transiently accreting nss with @xmath20 . at accretion rates",
    "@xmath21 the accreting metals gravitationally settle faster than they are supplied , and the atmosphere is nearly pure hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the dominant opacity is free - free absorption ( @xmath22 ) which results in a spectrum in which higher energy photons escape from deeper in the ns atmosphere , where the temperature is higher @xcite .",
    "this hardens the spectrum which , ( mis-)interpreted as a black - body , results in systematically higher temperatures and _ lower _ emission area radii . when the _ asca _  and _ rosat _  observations are fit with the more appropriate thermal h atmosphere spectrum , the emission area radii are @xmath1710 km @xcite , confirming that this emission is mostly thermal .",
    "these objects have thus become the focus of our efforts to measure the ns surface area .",
    "if the emission area radius of the thermal part of the quiescent x - ray spectrum is the ns radius , it should be constant from observation to observation .",
    "in addition , if accretion onto the ns makes no contribution to the quiescent luminosity , the temperature should also be constant on timescales @xmath23 yrs , the core cooling timescale ( see for exceptions ) . in the most sensitive observations ,",
    "an additional power - law component is observed above a few kev @xcite .",

    "we extracted data from a circle 10 pixels in radius about the 4x - ray source position , and background from an annulus with inner and outer radius of 13 and 50 pixels , respectively .",
    "there were a total of 2714 good counts in the source region , and 575 in the background region ; we expect 25 background counts in the source region ( @xmath171% of the total counts in the source region ) .",

    "the data were taken with a focal - plane chip temperature of @xmath26 , and we used the corresponding response files for this temperature , according to the standard acis - s analysis .",
    "we binned the photons between 0.5 and 1.5 kev into bins of width @xmath17130 ev wide , comparable to the energy resolution ( fwhm ) in the bi - s3 detector .",
    "above 1.5 kev , we binned the data so that there were 40 counts per bin ( wider than the spectral resolution )",
    ". we used spectral data in the energy range 0.5 - 10 kev .",
    "while there are significant counts below 0.5 kev , the acis - s energy calibration is presently not reliable below this energy ; we will re - examine this analysis when the energy calibration is refined below 0.5 kev .",
    "in addition , the current _ chandra _  response files for the acis - s - bi underestimate the detector area by up to 20% near 0.5 kev ( n. schulz , priv . comm . ) . to account for the calibration uncertainties",

    ", the single component models failed due to the presence of this high - energy component .",
    "we then fit the data with two - component models , where the second component is a power - law that accounts for the @xmath292 kev emission .",

    "] in addition , it has been shown previously that the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio is substantially greater than is typical for stellar coronal sources @xcite .",
    "we therefore reject a model which ascribes this emission to the corona of the stellar companion .",

    "however ,  was held fixed at the best - fit value of = 0.26 , which is higher than the optically implied value .",
    "we undertook a reanalysis of the _ bepposax _  observation of 4 , previously analyzed by c00 .",
    "there are two major differences between our spectral analysis of the lecs data ( 0.3 - 2 kev ) and theirs :    1 .   for the lecs background data , c00 used the standard `` blank fields '' background which are taken from several `` blank '' areas of the sky @xcite .",
    "however , 4  is located in a region of the sky with higher than average low - energy background ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , according to the rosat / all - sky - survey soft x - ray background maps ( @xmath170.75 kev ; , fig 6b ) .",
    "thus , the `` blank fields '' background underestimates soft x - ray background in the 4  observation .",
    "we used an alternative method of background estimation described by parmar  ( the `` annulus '' method ; ) , in which the background intensity is assumed to be proportional to the countrate in an annulus in the lecs detector , with a spectrum identical to that found with the `` blank fields '' method . by this method , the 0.3 - 1.0",
    "kev background counts account for 60% of the total counts in the 4  source region , whereas they only account for 34% in the `` blank fields '' method ; the counting uncertainty in the source region is 10% , and therefore this difference in background countrate is significant . as the `` annulus '' method scales with the local background countrate , it is a more realistic estimation of the local low - energy ( @xmath142 kev ) background , and so we adopt it .",
    "2 .   for the lecs data",
    ", we used a larger extraction radius than c00 ( 8  vs. 4 ) ; the lecs point - spread - function becomes broad toward the lower energies ( 80% encircled energy at 1.5 kev is 3.0 , and at 0.28 kev is 6.1 ; the 95% radius is 5.5 and 8.5 at 1.5 and 0.28 kev , respectively ) . the smaller extraction radius used by c00",

    "we estimate that using an 8  radius instead of a 4  radius increases the observed source countrate by 30% , which is larger than the poisson uncertainty of 10% .    for the mecs data",
    ", we used a 4  extraction radius , which extracted 651 counts ( comparable to the 632 found by c00 ) .",
    "we used the standard mecs background file ( mecs23_bkg.evt ) extracting background counts using the same region as for the source fields . the source background subtracted countrates are ( 5.31.6 ) c / s ( 0.1 - 3.1 kev ) and ( 3.30.4 ) c / s ( 1.7 - 9.0 kev ) in the lecs and mecs instruments , respectively .",
    "the lecs data has lower s / n than reported by c00 due to the higher background ; we find a slightly higher mecs countrate than found previously .    for comparison with previous work",

    "we were unable to put any reasonable limits on the bb radius ( @xmath290.4 km , unbounded from above ) , as the best - fit spectrum merely would increase the column density to compensate for larger and larger areas .",

    "none of these fits are formally statistically acceptable . however , while a change in @xmath30 is soundly rejected ( prob@xmath414 ) , and a change in @xmath40 is of low probability ( prob = 0.001 ) , changes in the  or  are found to be marginal ( both prob = 0.01 ) .",
    "this is in the range where systematic uncertainty in the detector responses ( in particular , the area as a function of energy ) become important .",
    "for example , if we increase the systematic uncertainty from 4% to 8% ( which , for example , could be due to a systematic offset in the absolute flux calibrations between the two detectors ) , the best fits for a changing  or  become statistically acceptable .",

    "this is comparable to the factor of @xmath243 decrease found over a few days by campana @xcite .",
    "we can not statistically exclude that the power - law component remains constant , and the thermal component varies .",
    "thus , 4  is variable in quiescence on timescales longer than hours .",
    "rutledge  @xcite have shown that the soft emission seen in all ns transients in quiescence is best explained as thermal emission from a pure hydrogen ns atmosphere .",
    "we have found the same in this _ chandra _  observation . indeed , comparing x - ray spectra taken with _",
    "chandra _ , _ asca _  and _ bepposax _  at different times over 4.9 years , we find that this thermal component is consistent with being constant , with a best - fit radius of @xmath40=12.92.6 @xmath50 km , and a temperature = 0.0760.007 kev .",
    "these results improve the precision of the quiescent spectrum by a factor of @xmath243 over previous work @xcite .",
    "we place an upper - limit on the amount of temperature variability across 4.9 years of @xmath5110% ( table  [ tab : jointfit ] ) . the agreement between this radius and that measured during type i x - ray bursts from other systems is strong confirmation that the emitting area is the ns surface .",
    "two energy sources for the thermal emission have been discussed : accretion in quiescence at a low - rate @xcite and re - emission of heat deposited into the crust during the large accretion events ( bbr98 ) .",
    "the required accretion rate for the bolometric luminosity of @xmath52 is @xmath53 , adequate to keep the metal content in the atmosphere comparable or larger than that in the accreting material @xcite .",
    "if the metal content in the accreting material is very sub - solar ( that is , effectively pure hydrogen ) , accretion at these rates would give thermal emission much like we observe @xcite .",
    "however , solar metallicity accretion is likely ruled out , largely due to the lack of absorption from the fe l edge near 0.5 kev .",
    "tighter constraints on the photospheric metallicity will be the subject of future work with these data and will allow us to more thoroughly constrain the active accretion hypothesis , which does not have a specific way of predicting @xmath54 .",
    "the other possible mechanism is re - emission of heat deposited in the inner crust due to pycnonuclear reactions , electron captures and neutron emissions @xcite during accretion events ( bbr98 ) .",
    "the layers where this heat is deposited are in close thermal contact with the ns core .",
    "the reactions then heat the core to a temperature of @xmath24 k over @xmath24 yr ( bbr98 ; ) .",
    "the ns reaches an equilibrium where the time averaged nuclear heating equals the quiescent thermal emission , @xmath55 , implying a time averaged accretion rate for this ns of @xmath56 .",
    "[ sec : recur ] we can compare this @xmath57 to that implied by the outbursts . the outburst in 1969",
    "had a total fluence of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "there has not been another large outburst of this magnitude recorded since ; the small outburst in 1979 had a fluence two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "it is uncertain to measure the time - averaged accretion rate on the basis of a single outburst .",
    "if a large outburst like that in 1969 occurs every 100 years , the time - averaged accretion flux would be @xmath59 , which at the 1.2 kpc distance gives @xmath60 , comparable to that implied by the level of the quiescent thermal emission .",
    "however , this is a low accretion rate for a binary at this long orbital period , where the likely driver of mass transfer is nuclear evolution of the binary ( see ) .",
    "so , this is an outstanding puzzle for this source .",
    "if outbursts like that seen in 1969 occur more frequently than 100 years , the time averaged accretion rate would be higher and in conflict with that implied by the quiescent thermal emission through the mechanism of bbr98 , unless the fraction of deposited energy re - emitted as photons is much less than unity . possible solutions to this , involving enhanced neutrino emission from the core , have been proposed by colpi @xcite and ushomirsky & rutledge @xcite .",
    "if the thermal emission is due to a hot neutron star core , then the measured effective temperature of @xmath61 tells us the internal ns temperature .",
    "for example , if the outer layer consists of light elements to a density @xmath62 , then using the fit of potekhin  @xcite , we find @xmath63@xmath64 .",
    "for these core temperatures , the modified urca neutrino luminosity is orders of magnitude less than the photon luminosity",
    ". the ns core would not be in a thermal steady - state if pion condensation occurs , as the resultant neutrino luminosity @xcite would be much larger than the heating supplied by reactions in the deep crust . as a result ,",
    "if some enhanced cooling mechanism were operating in the core , then we would expect @xmath63@xmath65 and the crust and surface temperature should be decreasing on a timescale of @xmath66 ( bbr98 ; ) .",
    "the lack of luminosity variability in general , and the stability of the thermal component over a @xmath245 year timescale supports the model proposed by bbr98 for the thermal component .",
    "it remains to be unequivocally demonstrated , however , that the variability observed is restricted to the power - law component , and that the variability of the temperature of the thermal component is limited to 1% , as expected from variations in the @xmath63  from outburst to outburst @xcite .",
    "the origin of the hard power - law component remains unclear .",
    "many ideas have been put forward , ranging from emission due to an active pulsar wind colliding with the accretion disk , x - ray emission from a turned - on radio pulsar @xcite and accretion onto the magnetosphere ( for a review , see ) .",
    "there is no direct knowledge of either the ns spin or magnetic field in cen  x-4 , though the presence of type i bursts points to @xmath67 .",
    "none of the above models make specific predictions about either the level of emission or its spectral shape which explain the present observations .    moreover , the limitation to @xmath141% rms of coherent intensity pulsations in the transiently accreting ns aql  x-1 ( another transient , type - i x - ray bursting source ) following a rapid decrease in flux @xcite which was interpreted as due to magnetic inhibition of the accretion flow @xcite does not support the idea that accretion onto the compact object is ultimately restricted by a `` propeller effect '' , favoring instead an interpretation of the end of transient outbursts as due to an end of the disk instability , such as occurs in dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "in fact , abrupt declines in dwarf novae outburst fluxes are observed , and are explained within the disk instability model @xcite , without invoking magnetic inhibition .",
    "the absence , then , of a magnetosphere in transiently accreting nss would preclude attributing the power - law to magnetospheric accretion , and energy production would have to be attributed to another site within the ns binary system .",
    "spectral comparison between the _ asca _  and _ chandra _  observation indicate that a change in ( only ) the power - law normalization is marginally acceptable , and therefore that a change in the spectral slope ( from @xmath68 to @xmath69 ) is also required .",
    "it is unclear how a change in the spectral slope could be produced while limiting the luminosity decrease to less than a factor of three in any of the proposed emission mechanisms @xcite .",
    "there might be some help in understanding the power - law component from other wavelength bands , where it was found recently that , in quiescence , the energy density ( @xmath70 ) is nearly flat from uv through the x - ray energy range , in marked contrast to , in which the energy density falls in the uv band @xcite .",
    "this flat - spectrum has been interpreted as due to a shock at the splash - point of accretion from the companion @xcite .",
    "however , while we also find a flat spectrum for the _ asca _  observation ( photon power - law slope of @xmath71 ) we find an _ increasing _ energy density during the _ chandra _  observation ( @xmath69 ) . clearly , further observational study of the power - law component is required to understand even its most basic aspects .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty in the measurement of the radius of the neutron star in 4  is the distance to the object .",
    "this will be dramatically improved by the space interferometric mission , which can measure the parallax of the 18@xmath725 counterpart to @xmath73asec , or @xmath141% distance uncertainty at 1.2 kpc .",
    "this would make  the dominant uncertainty in the measured thermal emission radius , followed by any systematic uncertainty in the modelled spectrum .",
    "for example , a planned 50 ksec xmm observation will permit constraint of @xmath74 to @xmath242% while simultaneously measuring .",
    "it has been suggested that some fraction of the low - luminosity x - ray sources in globular clusters are transiently accreting nss in quiescence @xcite .",
    "these make excellent targets for ns radius measurements , as there are multiple objects per observing field , all at the same distance and interstellar column density ( bbr98 ) .",
    "_ chandra _  imaging observations of globular clusters @xcite indicate source densities in excess of several per square arcmin ( down to luminosities of @xmath75 ) with over 100 x - ray sources in the core of 47 tuc alone .",
    "it is still unanswered as to what fraction of these are quiescent ns s .",
    "the high source density will complicate x - ray spectroscopy with xmm or _ con - x _  ( with angular resolution @xmath2415 ) , making _ chandra_imaging spectroscopy the best way to pursue this science .",
