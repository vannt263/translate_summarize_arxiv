    "many - body non - equilibrium dynamics has raised significant interest in recent years , in particular with connection to the atomic experiments where far - from - equilibrium phenomena can be conveniently investigated due to the long relaxation time of these systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , the dynamics after a quantum quench has been studied in several model hamiltonians 3,4,5,6 .",
    "the physics becomes even richer if we add engineered dissipation to the underlying system , which is possible to realize in atomic experiments .",
    "several interesting effects have been analyzed recently from interplay between interaction and dissipation in cold atomic gas @xcite .    motivated by this line of research , in this paper we study thermalization and temperature distribution in a linear ion chain , with two points of the chain driven respectively by a heating and a cooling thermal bath . in a sense ,",
    "the configuration here is an analog of a classical example in thermodynamics  the heat propagation in a bar with its two ends fixed at different temperature . in contrast to a simple linear temperature gradient as one sees in a classical bar , we find that the temperature distribution in a driven ion chain shows very rich behaviors in its steady states : first , the temperature distribution depends critically on the ratio between the driving speed and the interaction rate in the ion chain . in the weak driving region , the temperature distribution is non - monotonic across the ion chain and shows a strange mirror effect . in the strong driving region , instead of a linear temperature distribution , all the ions between the two driven ones are stabilized to a constant temperature which is in the middle of the two bath temperatures .",
    "second , we find that the bath which drives the ion with a medium coupling rate plays a more effective role in determining the temperature of the other ions in the system . when the bath drives the ion strongly , it has little influence on temperature of the other ions in the chain , which is pretty counter - intuitive . to see the unusual phenomena predicted in this paper , we discuss the requirements for an experimental observation and calculate the time dynamics to achieve the steady - state temperature distribution .",
    "the qualitative features of the steady - state temperature distribution patterns are pretty insensitive to the size of the ion crystal and they show up already in a pretty small ion chain with less than ten ions .",
    "the realization time to the steady state is realistic for observation compared with the current experimental time scale .",

    "ii we provide the theoretical model and the calculation method .",

    "v summarizes our major findings .",
    "we consider a chain of ions along the axial @xmath0-direction coupled with the coulomb interaction and driven individually by a thermal bath .",
    "the thermal bath can be provided , for instance , by cooling or heating laser beams shined on each ion .",
    "both the driving rate and the effective bath temperature can be tuned by controlling the intensity and the detuning of these laser beams .",
    "the oscillation of the @xmath1th ion around its equilibrium position is described by the coordinate and the momentum operators @xmath2 , with the dynamics determined by the heisenberg - langevin equation:@xmath3where @xmath4 denotes the coupling matrix between the ions , @xmath5 is the driving rate of the bath , and @xmath6 denotes the corresponding random force from the thermal bath .",
    "we consider in this paper the ions motion along the transverse @xmath7 direction , so the coupling matrix @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the transverse trapping frequency and @xmath13 denotes the ion equilibrium position along the axial direction .",
    "we take the ion spacing @xmath14 as the length unit , @xmath15 as the energy unit , and @xmath16 as the frequency unit so that every quantities in the matrix @xmath4 become dimensionless .",
    "note that with control of an anharmonic trapping potential along the axial direction , one can make the ion spacing uniform in a scalable trap @xcite .",
    "for the conventional harmonic axial trap , the ion spacing is not uniform . in that case , the equilibrium positions @xmath13 are determined numerically with the given trapping potential , and we take the unit @xmath14 as the largest spacing in the ion chain . the temperature distribution pattern that will be shown in sec .",
    "iii is insensitive to the details of the axial trapping potential , and for most of the calculations in the following , we assume the ion spacing is uniform for simplicity ( with exceptions in sec .",

    "the temperature does not fall down gradually from the hot end to the cold end as in the classical heat propagation problem , but takes a sharp jump right from the driven ion to the next one and then keeps constant over the whole chain . in the opposite limit of weak driving with @xmath60 ,",

    "it is even not monotonic across the ion chain , in sharp contrast with the distribution from the diffusion process . between these",

    "the temperature of the driven ions are indicated by thick ( red ) curves along the axis of the driving rate @xmath48 .",

    "[ fig : mirror](a ) shows an example of the temperature distribution where the heating ion is right at the center of the chain . when @xmath69 , the heating ion separates two plateaus in the temperature distribution : a lower temperature region between the heating and the cooling ions and a higher temperature region on the other side of the heating ion .",
    "as @xmath70 decreases , the two plateaus smoothly descend to the same temperature while the heating ion remains as a peak in the temperature distribution . when @xmath71 , the temperature distribution has a reflection symmetry with respect to the chain center .",

    "[ fig : gamma_transition ] expect that @xmath72 associated with the cooling bath(at @xmath74 ) and @xmath73 associated with the heating bath ( at @xmath63 ) are varied independently .",
    ", width=264 ]    in the above calculation , we assumed @xmath75 for the cooling and the heating ions .",
    "when these two driven ions are put at the edge , the middle ions are at a constant temperature @xmath76 which is exactly the average of the two bath temperatures .",
    "if the driving rate @xmath77 , we may expect that the bath which drives the ion more strongly plays a larger role in determining the temperate @xmath76 of the middle segment ions .",

    "the driving rate is comparable with the ion interaction rate in term of the order of magnitude .",
    "the middle segment temperature is close to the temperature of the bath that drives the ion at the optimal rate .",
    "when the driving gets too strong or too weak , the bath plays little role in determining the temperature of the other ions in the chain .",
    "this result has important implication for the sympathetic cooling @xcite : instead of fast cooling of the ancilla ions , cooling at a moderate optimal rate is more efficient in reducing the temperature of the computational ions .     with a coupling rate @xmath82 .",
    "( b ) the temperature profiles at different @xmath83 ( cross - section view of ( a ) ) .",
    "we find that the temperature profile for the main part of the chain , excluding the two edge ions , approaches a linear distribution at an intermediately small @xmath84.,width=264 ]    so far we have neglected dissipation of the middle segment ions .",
    "now , apart from the cooling and the heating bath ( with temperature @xmath51 and @xmath85 , respectively ) attached to the two edge ions , we assume all the middle ions are coupled to a background bath with temperature @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) at a coupling rate @xmath88 . the final temperature distribution of the ions is shown in fig .",

    "as @xmath88 further increases and gets close to @xmath70 , the temperature of the middle ions are pined to the background bath temperature @xmath86 as one expects and the temperature gradient disappears again in this limit .",

    "we have checked the temperature distribution of the ions with the size of the chain varying from ten to a few hundreds of ions and noticed no qualitative change of the distribution pattern . to experimentally test these unusual temperature distribution patterns",
    ", one can start with a small system of a few ions that are within the reach of the current experimental technology .",

    "we need to know the time scale to approach these steady states .",
    "[ fig : dynamics ] shows the relaxation dynamics for @xmath107 ions in either a harmonic or an anharmonic uniform trap @xcite . for a uniform trap ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics]a ) , the calculation shows that there are two time scales in the thermalization .",
    "first , with a time scale @xmath108 , the temperature of the two edge ions quickly approaches the corresponding bath temperature . during this step ,",

    "instead , it first comes pretty close to the corresponding bath temperature and then is dragged back toward its steady state value .",
    "the value of the second time scale @xmath109 increases with the system size ( roughly linearly ) and @xmath110 for @xmath107 ions . for a ytterbium ion ( @xmath111 ) chain with spacing 10 @xmath112 m",
    ", @xmath109 is about @xmath113 ms , which is a pretty reasonable time scale for experiments . for a harmonic trap ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics]b ) , the basic feature is similar except that the second time scale @xmath109 gets site dependent .",
    "the edge ions and their neighbors approach the corresponding steady - state temperature with a time scale that is comparable with the case of a uniform chain .",
    "however , as one moves away from the edge , the thermalization time gets much longer with an exponential increase . for the middle ion ,",
    "the thermalization is not finished yet with @xmath114 .",
    "with such an extremely long time scale , of course one can not neglect the small dissipation of the other ions to the background bath .",
    "if we take into account a small background dissipation , e.g. , with a rate @xmath115 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics]c , the long tale in the temperature evolution is completely gone for the harmonic trap .",
    "now , the temperature of all the ions approach their steady values within a time scale that is comparable with the uniform case , although the steady - state temperature of the middle segment ions is dragged down a bit toward the background bath temperature .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the steady state temperature distribution of a driven ion chain shows surprisingly rich patterns .",
    "many features of these patterns are unexpected , and they are in sharp contrast with the simple linear temperature gradient as one sees in the classical heat diffusion problem . our calculation is based on exact numerical methods with no unreliable approximations , so we believe all the unusual temperature distribution patterns revealed by this calculation will show up in experiments , although we still lack intuitive explanation of many of these features .",
    "we also investigate the relaxation dynamics and the time scale to reach the steady state , and show that these patterns should be observable under a realistic time scale in a small system that is within the current experimental reach ."
