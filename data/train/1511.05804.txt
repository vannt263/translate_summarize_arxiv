    "the bands correspond to a sinusoidal modulation of low reynolds number turbulence @xcite . in a larger range of reynolds number ,",
    "the growing or meta - stable turbulent spots are a time - dependent form of oblique laminar - turbulent coexistence @xcite . unlike the self - sustaining of turbulence in fully turbulent zones , the mechanisms responsible for the cohabitation of laminar and turbulent flow are still under investigation by mean of modelling @xcite or dns @xcite .",
    "it is all the more intriguing that one can see turbulence entirely collapse at @xmath7 in small domains @xcite .",

    "the phenomenon is reported in plane poiseuille flow as well @xcite .",
    "it was shown _ via _ dns of ppf that the secondary instability of the streaks occurred in the trailing edge of puff and slugs .",
    "this secondary instability led to azimuthal vorticity .",
    "the vortices are advected upstream , toward developed turbulence in the case of low reynolds number metastable puffs ; or downstream toward the laminar region , in the case of high reynolds number expending slugs .",
    "a lagrangian method was used to compute the speed of coherent structures in laminar - turbulent interfaces of puffs in pipe flow by holzner _",
    "this confirmed the less technical earlier measurements @xcite .",
    "shimizu & kida argued that the developed instability fed back on the turbulent puff , which in turn regenerate the velocity streaks , thus creating a cycle of sustainment of the puff @xcite .",
    "_ studied the phenomenon at several reynolds numbers and related the velocity of vortices relatively to the turbulent region to the growth and recess of turbulence region @xcite . in the case of pcf",
    ", part @xmath16 showed that the wall normal shear layers found inside the streaks developed into rolls , identified by their spanwise vorticity @xmath17 @xcite . besides , it showed that said rolls are advected either along the band at the velocity of the wall normal averaged large scale flow or toward the laminar zone where they are dissipated .    in order to understand the formation of vorticity , shimizu & kida @xcite and duguet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite referred to the local instability of a two dimensional shear layer @xcite . indeed , the assumption of a frozen shear layer or frozen corrugation undergoing an instability has been very efficient in the former studies of breakdown of velocity streaks @xcite .",
    "however they made no systematic study of the advection velocity of the perturbations .",
    "a parametric study , as a function of the position in the modulated laminar - turbulent coexistence , is necessary in order to model the modulated advection velocity measured in dns @xcite .",
    "a specific study is further justified by the fact that pcf has a spanwise extension and that the vorticity can be advected in both spanwise and streamwise directions .    in order to understand the development of the shear layers of the streaks into spanwise vorticity and its advection",
    ", we turn to linear stability analysis .",
    "this type of approach is justified since numerous studies showed that the velocity streaks remained coherent over long periods of time and that their evolution was well described by linear analysis @xcite .",
    "moreover , the scale separation in pcf between the wavelength of bands @xcite and spots @xcite ( @xmath18 gaps ) and the typical length scale of the perturbation to the velocity streaks ( a few gaps ) , calls for a quasi - parallel ( or local ) study of the instability @xcite .",
    "the computation of group velocities is central to that framework .",
    "it determines the convective or absolute nature of the instability , and therefore if and where the perturbations are advected .",
    "the non - parallel ( or global ) stability analysis , which considers the whole band , is the final stage of such approaches .",
    "one needs to determine the baseflow for such an analysis .",
    "this raises two questions because this baseflow is not the simple solution of a steady navier  stokes problem .",
    "firstly , one must extract the characteristics of the baseflow from dns .",
    "this is typically done by using a functional wall normal dependance deriving from average data , and determine the distribution of control parameters from dns data @xcite .",
    "said parameters yield a baseflow from the profiles averaged in time and along the diagonal direction of the band .",
    "indeed , these parameters take into account the spanwise corrugation and the turbulent fluctuations .",
    "secondly , one may have to take into account a reynolds stress force maintaining the velocity streaks @xcite as well as the slow spatial evolution of the baseflow @xcite . in that matter ,",
    "the study of the convective to absolute transition in the wake of a cylinder and of the self oscillating structure that ensued can enlighten us .",
    "such a transition can occur in a local study of the wall normal shear layer of velocity streaks . in both cases",
    ", one has to sample the velocity profile .",
    "the studies of the wake flow showed that the local and the global analyses , without stress and using a baseflow sampled from dns , reproduced numerical and experimental results very well @xcite .",
    "however , some cases are not as simple @xcite .",
    "it is not unreasonable to construct our baseflow from dns samples , however , the effect of such a force must be tested before including or neglecting it in a systematical study .    in order to investigate the secondary instability ,",
    "the article is organised as follow : the first section (   [ model ] ) is concerned with the description of the model of the turbulent baseflow (   [ modx ] ,  [ bf ] ) , based on sampling of dns data (   [ param ] ) .",
    "the section also describes a model of reynolds stress (   [ mrs ] ) .",
    "the second section (   [ lsp ] ) describes the framework of linear stability analysis used here (   [ fw ] ) and our numerical procedure (   [ num ] ) .",
    "the results of the analysis are presented in the next section (   [ res ] ) .",
    "local one component analysis is presented first (   [ res1 ] ) , then local two component analysis (   [ res2 ] ) , and eventually the global analysis (   [ glob ] ) . in the conclusion (   [ disc ] ) ,",
    "the results are summed up and put back in the context of the turbulent - laminar cohabitation , and the possibility of self - sustaining processes of laminar - turbulent cohabitation is discussed .",

    "describing the large - scale flow is fundamental in order to determine the type of profile to be used in the stability analysis and the streamwise dependence of the global flow .",

    "the dns is performed using the channeflow code by j. gibson @xcite with a resolution sufficient to give reliable quantitative results ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) @xcite .",
    "the procedure to obtain statistically steady bands is the same as in part @xmath16 : wall turbulence is obtained at @xmath32 , the reynolds number is decreased to @xmath15 , and the flow is allowed to evolve long enough for the band to stabilise @xcite .",
    "a fourier transform of the streamwise velocity field @xmath33 is performed at each wall normal position @xmath34 .",

    "the results on pcf can be discussed in view of the sustaining cycle of metastable puffs proposed by shimizu & kida @xcite .",
    "they noted that the turbulence inside the puff creates unstable profiles in the trailing edge .",
    "these profiles evolved in a manner similar to a kelvin - helmholtz instability of a vorticity sheet to create azimuthal vorticity @xcite . in the meta - stable puff regime , this vorticity is advected toward the puff @xcite .",

    "the description starts from the self sustaining process ( ssp ) of turbulence has been studied and described in dns , models @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "the streaks give the unstable profiles while the streaks streamwise vortices yield , after averaging , the large scale flow around the spots and bands ( arrow 1 ) .",
    "this article and the phenomenological studies focus on the second arrow of the cycle @xcite . the velocity streaks are unstable and spanwise vorticity is created .",
    "the large scale flow is responsible for the advection of that vorticity along the band .",
    "the absolute / convective transition of this instability as one enters the coherent structure of the band draws a parallel between the sustainment of the weakly turbulent band and the sustainment of self - oscillating structures and their transition to turbulence @xcite .",
    "it is very likely that the classical streaks instability undergoes such a convective / absolute transition as well @xcite , which brings more weight to this type of scenario .",
    "however , this part of the cycle ( third arrow ) is more qualitative and remains to be quantitatively explained .",
    "approaches such as the study of wave / mean flow interaction , common in geophysical fluid dynamics , could bring some insight on this stage of the cycle @xcite .",
    "indeed , they aim at explaining and computing the value of reynolds stress felt by the flow at large scale based on the rather irregular waves created and advected at small scale .",
    "this calls for detailed non - linear analysis of the interaction of these two instability modes in the `` swept '' context of plain couette flow .",
    "the case of plane couette flow perturbed by a wire , which is not swept , is probably closer to fed back self - oscillating structures @xcite .",
    "the stability analysis showed that this mechanism functioned in a range of reynolds number which largely included that of existence of the turbulent bands .",
    "this means that it can contribute to the sustainment of the bands .",
    "it is more than likely that the mechanisms for laminar hole formation are solely responsible for the appearance of laminar holes as @xmath8 is decreased below @xmath151 .",
    "meanwhile , a competition between a sustainment mechanism of the band such as the one described here and hole formation at low reynolds numbers could be used to explain that bands maintain themselves up to @xmath10 .",
    "this could be done in a manner similar to what has been done to explain spot expansion or retraction @xcite .",
    "this could also be done from another point of view , _ i.e. _ , that of simplified models ( chaotic or stochastic ) of such flows @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is generally termed spatiotemporal intermittency and results from the competition between local transient chaos and contamination from neighbours regenerating this chaos , as it is the case here . then , knowing the direction and celerity of advection tells which symmetry and which advection should be favoured .",
    "the identification of the creation of vorticity shows another source of noise ( or local chaos ) , besides of the streaks / vortices interaction usually involved .",
    "these results could be used to improve existing models . in particular , the fact that this sustainment mechanism involves the direction of advection of perturbations by a large scale flow could be used to explain the sustainment of turbulence in an oblique shape .    these scenarios , together with possible explanation on the distance between two bands and description of the failure of turbulence@xcite move toward a better understanding of the intriguing oblique band regime .",

    "<S> this article presents a modelling of the formation of spanwise vorticity in the turbulent streaks of the oblique bands and spots of transitional plane couette flow . a functional model is designed to mimic the coherent flow in the streaks . </S>",
    "<S> the control parameters of the model are extracted from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) statistical data . </S>",
    "<S> a reynolds stress is proposed to study the effect on the instability of this additional force maintaining the baseflow . </S>",
    "<S> local ( quasi - parallel ) temporal stability analysis is performed on that model to investigate the linear development of the spanwise vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> results show that average profiles , even if they have an inflection , are stable : the shear layers inside the velocity streaks are responsible for the vorticity formation . </S>",
    "<S> emphasis is put on the convective or absolute nature of the instability , depending on the location in the band . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that a transition from a convective to an absolute instability occurs in the zone in between fully turbulent and laminar flow . </S>",
    "<S> the group velocity of the most unstable modes compare well to the advection velocity of spanwise vorticity measured in dns . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation is completed by the global ( non - parallel ) stability analysis of a typical band case . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the possible cycles of sustainment of localised low reynolds number turbulence of shear flows are discussed in the light of these results .    </S>",
