    "the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies and of their early - type galaxy population is a topic of active debate .",
    "studying the integrated light from stellar populations can help to discriminate between models of giant elliptical galaxy formation : the monolithic collapse model ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eggen et al . , 1962 ) ) in which giant elliptical galaxies form rapidly in a process that can essentially be considered a single collapse and the hierarchical merging model ( @xcite ) in which giant elliptical galaxies are built up over a long timescale by distinct merger events . if it was found that early - types were largely coeval in clusters then this would favour the monolithic collapse model , whereas a large spread in ages would favour hierarchical merging .    increasing a galaxy s age by a factor of two while decreasing it s metallicity by a factor of three results in a spectrum almost indistinguishable from the original ( @xcite ) .",
    "this age / metallicity degeneracy can be partially broken by comparing age - sensitive spectroscopic indices with metallicity - sensitive spectroscopic indices . by plotting two such indices against each other and comparing the results to stellar population models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite )",
    "we can determine the mean relative luminosity - weighted age and metallicity of a given stellar population .",
    "previous work in this area has concentrated on individual clusters such as coma ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and fornax ( @xcite ) with sometimes conflicting results coming from the same cluster , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gonzalez et al . ( 1993 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* moore et al . ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "coma and fornax represent the extremes of the cluster richness scale and this project will study clusters that fill in this range .",
    "we will study , in detail , the stellar populations in several low - redshift ( @xmath5 ) clusters from the core out into the surrounding structures .",
    "these results will then be used as a comparison for observations of a range of higher - redshift clusters ( @xmath6 ) , allowing us to draw conclusions about the formation and evolution of the stellar populations in rich clusters .",
    "line - strength measurements , redshifts and velocity dispersions were obtained for 183 galaxies from four clusters over three nights in april 2002 with the 2df system on the 3.9 m aat .",
    "the sample was selected from galaxies with @xmath7 , within a @xmath8 diameter fov centred on each of the clusters and within a @xmath9 redshift range centred on the cluster redshift .",
    "the 300b grating ( @xmath10 fwhm ) was used to obtain a wide spectral range covering as many indices as possible , while the 1200v grating ( @xmath11 fwhm ) was used to obtain higher resolution spectra yielding precise velocity dispersions .",
    "comparison of the measured equivalent widths of h@xmath12 and [ mgfe ] for two of our clusters , coma and a1139 , and predictions from the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thomas et al . ( 2003 ) ) stellar population models is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thomas ] . using these models",
    "we obtain relative ages and metallicities for our stellar populations .",
    "we find that coma cluster galaxies have a mean age of @xmath13 gyr with a mean metallicity of @xmath14 dex relative to solar .",
    "a1139 , we find , has a mean age of @xmath15 gyr with a mean metallicity of @xmath16 dex relative to solar .",
    "refinements still need to be made to the data set and the other clusters need to be analysed before any conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the age / metallicity degeneracy is quite evident from these plots .",
    "also , there seems to be some disagreement between our observations and the models .",
    "the data points with low h@xmath12 equivalent widths could be star - forming galaxies , which we wish to exclude from this part of the analysis . by examining each galaxy",
    "s spectra for emission lines indicative of a star - forming galaxy and by measuring h@xmath17 equivalent widths we can eliminate these galaxies from our sample .",
    "in fig . [ fig : scaling ] we show the mg__b__@xmath2 ( the dash denoting that the index value has been converted from angstroms to magnitudes ) and h@xmath4 versus central velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 ) scaling relations for all four of our clusters .",
    "the solid line in both plots are our robust fit to the data from all four clusters while the dotted lines are fits taken from the literature .",
    "we find that h@xmath4 is anti - correlated with @xmath3 and find good agreement between our fit of h@xmath18 and that from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kunstchner ( 2000 ) ) of h@xmath19 .",
    "the likely implication is that more massive galaxies are older relative to less massive galaxies .",
    "mg__b__@xmath2 , however , we find is correlated with @xmath3 .",
    "the usual explanation for this correlation is that larger ellipticals have a deeper potential and hence find it easier to hold on to heavier elements produced in supernova explosions than do smaller ellipticals .",
    "we obtain a fit of mg__b__@xmath20 while the fit found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* colless et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) is mg__b__@xmath21 .",
    "the slopes agree quite well but there seems to be an offset between our fit and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* colless et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) .",
    "we also note an offset in mg__b _ _ between our clusters . since previous results have found no significant change in the zero - point of this relation ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* colless et al . , 1999 ) ) we suspect this may be a data reduction issue , but it may possibly indicate cluster to cluster variations , contrary to previous results ."
