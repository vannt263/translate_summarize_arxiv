    "the phenomenon of wetting has been the subject of intense attention and a fairly good understanding of the basic concepts and mechanisms has emerged@xcite . in the simplest case ,",
    "a solid inert surface is put in contact with an under - saturated vapor of a second substance .",
    "typically , a molecularly thick liquid - like film will form on the substrate surface due to favorable molecular interactions .",
    "the liquid film is in equilibrium with its under - saturated vapor , thus giving rise to a second interface ( the emerging liquid - vapor interface ) , referred to hereafter as the liquid interface .",
    "depending on the detailed molecular interactions between all three phases and the resulting interfacial energies , the liquid film can either grow to macroscopic thickness or remain finite as coexistence between the liquid and its vapor is approached .",
    "the first situation corresponds to _ complete wetting _ with a diverging film thickness , the second case is called _ incomplete _ or _ partial wetting_.    two other , closely related situations are possible : ( i ) the liquid layer ( e.g. , water ) on the inert substrate can be in equilibrium with its solid phase ( ice ) at temperatures below the melting point . in this case",
    "the vapor is replaced by a solid and the appearance of a thin liquid layer between the substrate and the solid phase indicates interfacial premelting .",
    "note that the third phase ( the ice ) is entirely different from the solid substrate .",
    "( ii ) the substrate itself can be a solid in equilibrium with its vapor phase . here",
    "the formation of a thin liquid layer as three - phase coexistence is approached corresponds to surface premelting@xcite .",
    "the phenomenological description of these scenarios does not differ from the wetting situation , and one finds the analogous phenomena corresponding to partial and complete wetting .    in early theoretical studies ,",
    "the solid substrate was assumed to be flat and homogeneous .",
    "however , in most experimental and technological situations the substrate is both rough and inhomogeneous . for complete wetting upon approaching coexistence , where the liquid forms a thin and continuous film , the influence of substrate roughness and chemical disorder has recently been investigated theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite in great detail .",
    "it was found that heterogeneity and roughness of the solid substrate in conjunction with long - range van der waals interactions cause equilibrium undulations of the liquid film surface .",
    "surface tension , on the other hand , acts as a damping mechanism which reduces the amplitude of undulations for thicker films .",
    "the theoretical results@xcite were verified recently in small - angle x - ray scattering@xcite .",
    "yet another realization of the wetting phenomenon is obtained if a _",
    "non - volatile _ liquid is spread on a solid surface ; in technological applications , the liquid might be a paint or a lubricant . in this case , the liquid is neither in phase equilibrium with the solid substrate nor with the gaseous phase , and the total amount of liquid on the substrate is a conserved quantity@xcite . in the complete wetting situation ,",
    "the liquid forms a continuous film on the substrate ; in the partial or incomplete wetting case , the liquid forms droplets with the contact angle being determined by the interfacial energies between the three phases meeting at the contact line@xcite .",
    "roughness of the substrate has been shown to cause contact angle hysteresis for advancing and receding contact lines@xcite .",
    "a lot of work was specifically concerned with the interfacial and surface premelting properties of ice , due to its atmospheric and environmental consequences@xcite .",
    "surface premelting of ice has been observed by a variety of experimental techniques@xcite , and it is now believed that complete surface premelting ( i.e. , macroscopic growth of the surface liquid layer as the melting temperature is approached ) only occurs for some orientations of the crystal surface and only if the vapor phase is diluted with air@xcite .",
    "interfacial premelting of ice , giving rise to the low sliding friction of ice , has been deduced from wire regelation at low temperature@xcite , and from viscosity measurements between surfaces of ice and quartz@xcite ; it also forms the basis for frost heave in frozen soils@xcite .",
    "complete interfacial premelting between ice crystals and a glass substrate was detected by ellipsometry@xcite .",
    "the geometric structure of the glass surface was shown to play a vital role in this premelting phenomenon ; in a series of experiments , the surface has been roughened by exposition to fluoric acid for different amounts of time , leading to surfaces with varying characteristic height - fluctuation amplitudes and wavelengths@xcite . for flat glass substrates",
    "the premelting was shown to be incomplete , while complete premelting was exhibited for glass substrates with a threshold amount of micro roughness@xcite .",
    "the latter experimental observation motivated us to explore theoretically the possibility of a _ roughness - induced _ complete wetting or premelting transition .",
    "this describes the situation in which the _ flat _ substrate , for a given temperature , is not covered with a macroscopic liquid layer as coexistence is approached ( corresponding to partial wetting ) , but , at the same temperature , is completely wet if the roughness of the substrate exceeds a certain threshold ( in what follows we will use the wetting terminology both for the phenomena of premelting and wetting ) . in this paper",
    "we critically examine the conditions under which such a phenomenon can occur . as a result",
    ", roughness - induced wetting is indeed possible if the involved materials have the following properties : i ) the tension of the substrate - vapor interface has to be larger than that of the substrate - liquid interface .",
    "ii ) the surface area increase of the solid substrate due to its roughness has to exceed a certain threshold , which depends on the interfacial tensions of all three phases@xcite .",
    "iii ) the effective interaction between the two interfaces bounding the liquid layer for the flat case has to have a maximum for separations of about the amplitude of the substrate roughness .",
    "we also find that roughness - induced wetting is most likely to occur when the substrate roughness just exceeds a certain threshold value and will disappear for very large amplitudes of the roughness .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and review some nomenclature for the case of a flat substrate . in sec .",
    "iii we extend the analysis to the case of a rough substrate .",
    "we first give necessary and rather general conditions under which roughness - induced wetting is possible . using a formula which describes the van der waals interaction between two sinusoidal surfaces ,",
    "we then construct a sufficient condition for roughness - induced wetting in the form of a lower bound for the interaction between two flat interfaces .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv contains the discussion .",
    "consider the situation as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where a thin liquid film intrudes in between an inert solid surface and a top phase . the top phase can be either a vapor or a solid in thermodynamic equilibrium with the liquid film .",
    "the solid substrate , on the other hand , is completely frozen and far from its melting point . in this section , we will review results for an ideal solid substrate ; namely , molecularly flat and homogeneous . using the convention of labeling all physical quantities with a _",
    "zero _ subscript for the flat case , the free energy per unit area can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the solid - liquid interfacial tension , and @xmath2 denotes the interfacial tension between the liquid and the top phase .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is the chemical potential difference between the liquid and top phases .",
    "alternatively , it could also correspond to a lagrange multiplier controlling the film thickness for non - volatile liquids with conserved total volume .",
    "the potential @xmath4 represents the interaction per unit area between the two flat interfaces with a separation of @xmath5 and can be viewed as a thickness - dependent correction to the interfacial energies , depending both on the short and long - ranged parts of the molecular interactions@xcite .    in the simplest approach , assuming pair - wise additive interactions between molecules and uniform densities in all coexisting phases , @xmath4 can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 corresponds to the local interaction energy difference per unit volume squared between the solid and the third phase . dropping some constant terms , it can be written as @xmath8 here , @xmath9 are the pair interactions between molecules and the @xmath10 are the particle number densities for each phase , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are any of the relevant phases : solid ( s ) , liquid ( l ) , top phase ( t)@xcite . in a more realistic approach , one calculates ( 2 ) directly using the lifshitz continuum theory of dispersion interactions@xcite .    in general , @xmath4 is expected to vanish for @xmath13 as the two interfaces become decoupled and approaches a finite value for @xmath14@xcite .",
    "one therefore defines @xmath15 where @xmath16 is traditionally called the _ spreading coefficient _ and is given by @xmath17    the above definition leads to @xmath18 , just as one would expect : in the absence of any liquid , the total free energy is given by the interfacial tension between the solid and the top phase@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for an infinite layer of liquid coexisting with the top phase , one finds @xmath19 for @xmath20 , i.e. , the two interfaces bounding the liquid do not interact and the total free energy is given by the sum of the two interfacial energies alone .",
    "one can notice that positive values of @xmath21 correspond to a situation where an infinite liquid layer is energetically preferred over a vanishing liquid layer .",
    "indeed , neglecting the possibility of additional minima of @xmath4 at intermediate values of @xmath5 , positive and negative values of @xmath16 correspond to wetting and non - wetting cases , respectively . on the other hand , in the case of a non - vanishing chemical potential @xmath3",

    "we will be exclusively concerned with the non - wetting case , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "it will be convenient to modify the definition of the free energy slightly and to take the infinitely thick liquid layer as the reference state .",

    ", the solid roughness has to be quite pronounced and the behavior of the liquid interface turns out to be mostly dominated by the short - ranged part of the molecular interaction . for @xmath92 , defining the _ tension dominated regime _ , condition ( 30 ) can be fulfilled even for small solid roughness ( @xmath86 ) ; here , the liquid interface is dominated by its surface tension .",
    "it is the tension - dominated regime where the approximations leading to ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) and other simplifications made in the remainder this paper are valid ; this is also the regime of most practical interest , since values for @xmath93 characterizing rough surfaces in experiments are typically quite small@xcite .",
    "an additional necessary condition for wetting is @xmath94 valid for average film thicknesses approximately larger than the corrugation amplitude , @xmath95 .",
    "this condition can be obtained in the following way : suppose we have a flat liquid interface , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "then the first term in ( 18 ) vanishes , and in order for the minimized free energy difference @xmath72 to be positive we have to require @xmath94 .",
    "clearly , a flat liquid interface is only possible for a liquid layer thickness which is larger than the amplitude of the solid roughness , otherwise the two interfaces sterically interact .",
    "figure 4 schematically depicts the limiting case @xmath97 with the flat liquid interface just touching the solid substrate at the largest height fluctuation characterized by the amplitude @xmath76 .",
    "for sinusoidal interfaces described by ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) and using the non - crossing constraint ( 27 ) , one obtains the inequality @xmath98 for smaller distances , the interaction @xmath99 can actually become negative with @xmath72 still being strictly positive , because then the free energy expression ( 18 ) always has a positive energy contribution from the interfacial tension of the liquid interface .",
    "this result has consequences for the important class of wetting potentials with a single minimum at finite but rather large wetting film thickness , which describe continuous wetting transitions as the minimum moves outwards to infinity : if the minimum occurs at distances larger than the roughness amplitude , it follows from ( 31 ) that the substrate roughness will not induce the wetting of the substrate .    from the above considerations we see that the interaction @xmath99 has to have rather complex behavior ; at zero @xmath5 or vanishing liquid film it is negative , since @xmath100 and we start with the assumption of a non - wetting behavior ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) for the flat solid surface . only considering the @xmath50 situation we see that there is a threshold value of the solid roughness in order to make the vanishing film limit energetically unfavorable compared to the infinite film limit , see ( 24 ) . for a film thickness larger than the amplitude of the solid roughness , the interaction @xmath99 has to be repulsive in order to make roughness - induced wetting possible , see ( 31 ) .",
    "the question that arises naturally is whether such a behavior is actually possible and what the conditions on the molecular interaction @xmath101 are .      in this section ,",
    "we want to show for general film thicknesses under which conditions roughness - induced wetting , as defined by eq .",
    "( 22 ) , occurs . in order to do so",
    ", we need to minimize the free energy with respect to the fluid interface profile @xmath102 for each average film thickness @xmath5 and for a given molecular interaction @xmath7 and interfacial tensions , according to ( 16 ) [ with @xmath102 entering the expressions ( 8) and ( 9 ) ] .",
    "we then have to check whether @xmath103 holds for each @xmath5 . if it turns out that @xmath104 for a given @xmath5 , we know that the system will prefer to have a stable film of this thickness , and wetting will not occur .    for the present purpose",
    ", we turn this procedure somewhat around : we will try to determine the interaction for which roughness - induced wetting , for given values of the interfacial tensions and the substrate roughness , does occur .",
    "furthermore , in many situations the molecular interaction @xmath7 is not easily available , and usually the wetting potential for two flat interfaces , @xmath4 , as defined by ( 2 ) , is readily measured and calculated .",
    "we will therefore use a novel relation between the planar interaction @xmath4 and the wetting potential between two sinusoidally modulated interfaces , @xmath105 , which is derived in the appendix . using this relation ,",
    "we express the condition for roughness - induced wetting in terms of a lower bound on the planar interaction @xmath4 .",
    "the analysis will be presented in the next two subsections .",

    "still , the formula ( 32 ) is rather complicated and calculating the spatially averaged potential @xmath116 is by no means trivial .",
    "the following observation is crucial : for a given value of @xmath5 , the argument of @xmath117 in ( 32 ) is strictly smaller than @xmath118 ( since @xmath119 ) .",
    "we can therefore choose a linear trial function of the form @xmath120 for a given value of @xmath5 , we require the trial @xmath121 to be a lower bound of the flat - interface potential @xmath122 , i.e. , @xmath123 , in the finite range @xmath124 , which puts certain bounds on the slope @xmath125 .",

    "the resultant trial free energy is given by @xmath129 minimizing this free energy expression with respect to @xmath79 , one obtains the following amplitude @xmath130 which characterizes the minimizing liquid interface profile @xmath131 .",
    "the liquid interface corrugation is in phase with the substrate configuration , since @xmath22 .",
    "since the two interfaces have to satisfy the non - crossing constraint ( 27 ) , the minimizing amplitude @xmath132 can be realized only for a thickness larger than some characteristic length @xmath133 .",

    "we obtain a plateau in the interval @xmath171 ; for @xmath172 the lower bound is given by @xmath173 .",
    "in our estimate for the value of @xmath174 we set @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is defined by @xmath177 ( see fig .",

    "the interpretation of the results in fig .",
    "7 is the following : for a given ratio of the spreading coefficient @xmath16 and the liquid interfacial tension @xmath2 , which are determined by the interfacial tensions of the problem alone and conspire to give @xmath139 , one rescales the amplitude of the wetting potential @xmath4 ( which can be measured or calculated theoretically ) by the spreading coefficient and the distance @xmath5 by the roughness amplitude @xmath76 . if the rescaled potential @xmath198 is larger than @xmath199 for all arguments , i.e. if the sufficient condition ( 44 ) is fulfilled , a complete wetting situation will result .",
    "an interesting feature of our results comes from the fact that we obtain universal lower bounds as a function of the film thickness @xmath5 rescaled by the roughness amplitude @xmath76 .",
    "this suggests that there exists for a given substrate excess surface area @xmath200 an optimal value of the roughness amplitude @xmath76 for roughness - induced wetting to occur .",
    "since the maximum of the lower bound @xmath199 is located at @xmath201 , this optimal value of @xmath76 happens to coincide with the approximate location of the maximum of @xmath4 , the wetting potential .",
    "assume that the sufficient condition ( 45 ) is in fact satisfied for this optimal value of @xmath76 . for roughness amplitudes much smaller than this optimal value",
    "( the function @xmath117 will be pushed to the right in the scaling plot fig .",
    "7 ) the sufficient condition can not be satisfied for very small film thicknesses due to the finite slope of the wetting potential , suggesting an infinitesimally thin stable film ( no wetting ) . for roughness amplitudes much larger than the optimal value ( the function @xmath117 will be squeezed to the left in fig .",
    "7 ) the sufficient condition is not satisfied for average film thicknesses larger than some value at the order of the roughness amplitude , suggesting the formation of a very thin liquid film occupying preferentially the valleys of the substrate surface fluctuations ( partial prewetting ) .      here",
    "we treat the general case with @xmath202 , now including the cases where the substrate roughness @xmath64 is larger than the necessary value obtained by setting @xmath139 in ( 21 ) .",
    "in addition , we will require the free energy difference ( 18 ) to be larger than a constant denoted by @xmath203 , as will turn out to be important if one looks at stable wetting layers in the presence of a chemical potential ( see section iii.d ) .",
    "using a trial function of the form ( 33 ) the following bounds for the slope @xmath125 follow    @xmath204    @xmath205    since @xmath206 for @xmath207 now is non - monotonic and has a maximum at @xmath208 given by @xmath209 the global lower bound @xmath155 can be calculated according to ( 46 ) only in the restricted range of @xmath210 . for @xmath211 ,",
    "the function @xmath155 as defined by ( 45 ) has a constant slope of @xmath212 given by ( 50 ) since @xmath213 strictly holds .",

    "the interesting feature is that the plateau of @xmath155 for @xmath217 increases with increasing @xmath141 .",
    "this indicates that for a given wetting potential @xmath4 and a given roughness amplitude @xmath76 the roughness - induced wetting transition might disappear for wave numbers much larger than the threshold value determined by ( 30 ) .",
    "so far , we have calculated a lower bound for the interaction , denoted by @xmath155 , so that the free energy difference @xmath72 is positive , eq .",

    "however , the substrate will always be covered with a film of _ finite _ thickness . for clarity sake ,",
    "let us assume the potential @xmath4 to have a single maximum at finite separation , decay for large separations like @xmath219 ( where @xmath220 if the molecular interaction is given by ( a7 ) ) and be negative for zero separation , as corresponding to the non - wetting situation for a flat substrate .",
    "one notes that @xmath221 for non - retarded van der waals interactions .    for finite chemical potential",

    "we will now do a local stability analysis for this free energy minimum .",
    "the linearized euler equation , determining the stable liquid interface profile , can be obtained from the free energy expression ( 8) by requiring local force equilibrium , @xmath229)/ \\partial \\zeta_l(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho$})=0 $ ] , and is given by @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the disjoining pressure for flat interfaces .",

    "in contrast to the global stability analysis leading to ( 55 ) , where we averaged over the spatial coordinate @xmath31 , the local equilibrium analysis now actually gives a non - vanishing amplitude @xmath79 . inserting this amplitude back into the free energy expression ( 54 )",
    ", the stable film thickness is increased",
    ". however , the correction turns out to be less singular for the case of van der waals forces and thus does not affect the asymptotic behavior of @xmath237 as given by ( 55 ) .",
    "some necessary conditions for roughness - induced wetting have been obtained on very general grounds .",
    "first , the tension of the liquid interface has to be larger than the negative spreading coefficient , or , equivalently , the tension of the substrate - vapor interface has to be larger than the tension of the substrate - liquid interface .",
    "second , the roughness of the substrate , measured by the excess area as compared to the flat substrate , has to exceed a certain threshold , see ( 24 ) . using an approach which is equivalent to a linear response analysis",
    ", we obtain a formula relating the molecular interaction between two rough interfaces to the interaction of two flat interfaces ; the latter is the so - called wetting potential . using this formula , a lower bound for wetting potentials in order to obtain this new type of wetting transition",
    "is derived .",
    "this lower bound constitutes a sufficient condition .",
    "more specifically , this lower bound has the following properties : i ) for vanishing liquid film , or for zero separation between the two interfaces bounding the liquid layer , the interaction ( which for this limit is the so - called spreading coefficient ) is negative , corresponding to a non - wetting situation in the case of flat interfaces ; ii ) the lower bound has a pronounced maximum with a height of at least the negative spreading coefficient at a separation of about the roughness amplitude .",
    "this height depends on the ratio between the liquid - interface tension @xmath2 and the spreading coefficient @xmath16 .",
    "these results concerning the possibility of a roughness - induced wetting transition agree with the very recent experimental observation of premelting induced by substrate roughness at the glass - ice interface@xcite , where glass surfaces showing a roughness with typical amplitudes of @xmath238 induced a complete interfacial premelting .",
    "independently , the calculation of the dispersion interaction between half spaces of glass and ice separated by a liquid water layer show a pronounced maximum at about the same distance @xmath239@xcite , consistent with our prediction for the lower bound of the wetting potential .",
    "we find the asymptotic behavior of the film thickness as a function of the chemical potential to be characterized by the standard van der waals exponent , as shown in sec .",
    "this is in disagreement with the experimentally measured exponent @xmath240@xcite , which is to be contrasted with the exponent @xmath241 as expected for non - retarded van der waals interactions in the absence of any other interactions .",
    "finally , we note that the interfacial energies for the case of interfacial premelting are influenced by grain - boundary energies in the disordered polycrystalline layers adjacent to the microscopically irregular substrate wall .",
    "in fact , it was argued @xcite that this effect could independently lead to a roughness - induced premelting transition .",
    "such a mechanism could be described within our framework by assuming an interfacial energy @xmath2 which depends explicitly on the roughness magnitude of the liquid interface .",
    "a further interesting effect might appear for the case of surface triple - point premelting : here a roughness - induced complete surface melting could be triggered by a roughening transition of the solid surface@xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence of our results is that a discontinuous wetting transition might be converted into a continuous transition by a change of the effective wetting potential at small distances .",
    "our calculations are most valid for small substrate roughness , as defined by @xmath242 ; this also seems to be the experimentally most relevant limit , since rough surfaces produced by etching usually show modest corrugation amplitudes@xcite .",
    "the closed - form expressions for the interaction of two corrugated interfaces obtained in the appendix are to the best of our knowledge novel and applicable to a wide range of phenomena , including dewetting phenomena ( where the whole argument has to be inverted , leading to roughness - induced dewetting ) .",
