    "one of the most interesting proposed extensions of the standard model is based on a 5-dimensional space - time @xcite containing one or more branes , 4-dimensional subspaces where some of the fields are localized .",
    "such models usually assume that space time has a topology @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the usual minkowski space and @xmath2 is a manifold that may or may not be compact , and a non - separable metric ( i consider here only the so - called `` small extra dimension '' models ) ; the original models assumed @xmath2 to be one - dimensional but this has since been generalized @xcite .",
    "when this space - time configuration and brane content correspond to a stable solution of the field equations , it can serve as a vacuum where quantum fluctuations propagate ; the assumption being that this background configuration corresponds to a minimum of the effective action for the complete system .",
    "this paradigm offers an innovative solution to the hierarchy problem and a wealth of new effects that may be observed at the lhc .",
    "motivated by this , several authors have constructed realistic or semi - realistic models based on this idea , and have studied a variety experimental signatures @xcite .",
    "the stability of the background configurations under small harmonic perturbations has also been studied @xcite . in the seminal publications  @xcite it was shown that for the models there considered most perturbations are not destabilizing ; the one exception being the dilaton , a self - similar scaling perturbation which is neutral ( has no quadratic potential term or , equivalently , is associated with zero frequency ) .",
    "this problem , however can be eliminated by the addition of appropriate bulk scalar fields @xcite , which has been studied in a variety of cases : for single scalar fields coupled minimally to gravity @xcite , non - minimally coupled scalars @xcite , and for brans - dicke theories @xcite .",
    "these higher - dimensional theories , being non - renormalizable , have an intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff scale @xmath3 beyond which they are not reliable ( at least within perturbation theory ) . in models where branes are infinitely thin ( in the fifth coordinate ) , it is tacitly assumed that their structure will become manifest at scales @xmath4 . but",
    "this need not be the case , and a certain amount of attention has been paid to the possibility that the dynamics at scales below @xmath3 is responsible for the brane configuration . a variety of such models have been studied in the literature for non - compact @xmath2 with one @xcite , or several @xcite minimally - coupled scalars .",
    "in addition , the stability of such models has been investigated for the case of non - compact @xmath2 and one @xcite or several @xcite minimally coupled scalars , and for @xmath2 compact and a flat metric @xcite .",
    "models with @xmath2 compact that exhibit periodic , stable , brane - like configurations generated by physics below @xmath3 ( `` thick branes '' ) , and which have a non - trivial metric are more difficult to construct .",
    "the reasons are , first , that for the simplest models the background configurations can not satisfy the periodicity requirement ( _ e.g. _ they fail to satisfy one or more of the sum rules listed in @xcite , as required for consistency ) .",
    "and second , general considerations @xcite apparently preclude the stabilization of thick - brane solutions using only scalar fields .    the goal of the present paper is to provide mechanisms that overcome these two difficulties . specifically , to exhibit a class of 5-dimensional models containing gravity , scalars , and antisymmetric tensor fields , which admit periodic kink - like solutions that are perturbatively stable at scales below @xmath5 .",
    "though the theories thus obtained have no phenomenological applications ( _ e.g. _ they exhibit but a small amount of warping , so that no significant mass hierarchy can be generated ) , they are of interest because they can address these two problems . though there are some indications that more realistic configurations can also be obtained ( sect .",
    "[ sec : bs ] ) , i will not attempt to construct a phenomenologically viable model , nor will i not attempt to address the much more ambitious and difficult problems of confining fields to the branes and of global stability . for a different class of theories , based on the `` large extra dimensions '' paradigm  @xcite ,",
    "there are realistic models that include both dynamically generated branes and a confining mechanism for the  fields ; see for example  @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented are essentially classical , amounting to obtaining solutions to the equations of motion that are stable under harmonic perturbations .",
    "the usefulness of these results lie in the well - established connection between such solutions and related quantum objects  @xcite ; in particular , the classical background solutions are to be interpreted as the lowest order semi - classical approximation to a quantum vacuum , and the frequencies of the harmonic perturbations as the energies of the low - lying excitations .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following .",
    "the next section introduces a class of models involving only scalars , that support periodic configurations , which in favorable cases are similar to the ones in @xcite .",
    "these background configurations are unstable ( sect .",
    "[ sec : stability ] ) , but this problem can be solved through the introduction of antisymmetric tensor fields ( sect .",

    "the last section contains some parting comments and observations , while some mathematical considerations are delegated to the appendices .",
    "i first consider the problem of constructing kink - like configurations that involve gravity and are periodic in the fifth coordinate of a 5-dimensional space - time etc denote 5-dimensional space - time indices , greek indices will refer to the 4-dimensional non - compact coordinates ; the metric signature is @xmath6 .",

    "i will now make the simplifying assumption that the periods of @xmath149 for @xmath150 are much smaller than that of @xmath151 ; for example , if @xmath152 denotes the period of @xmath153 , that of @xmath154 can be chosen to be @xmath155 with @xmath156 a large prime number ; the period @xmath36 in ( [ eq : per.con ] ) then equals @xmath157 . in this case @xmath158 and @xmath159 in ( [ eq : chi.a ] ) will have entries that are slowly varying and others that vary very rapidly , and this equation can be treated using the procedure described in  @xcite : up to corrections of order @xmath160 , the solution can be obtained by considering only the slowly varying terms in ( [ eq : chi.a ] ) : - _ r  - _ r,1 _ 1 _ 1 = - p^2 _ r + p^2 s_r _ s_rs _ s [ eq : av.eq ] ( no sum over @xmath38 ) where , as before , @xmath161 , and _ rs = _ u>1 ( _ r1",
    "_ s1 + _ ru _ su ) a_u .",
    "the term containing @xmath162 in ( [ eq : av.eq ] ) is generated by averaging the rapidly varying terms in ( [ eq : chi.a ] ) over periods @xmath163 .",
    "the equation for @xmath164 can now by analyzed using standard techniques ( see e.g. @xcite ) : denoting @xmath165 there will be a non - singular matrix @xmath166 such that @xmath167 , and the system will support destabilizing modes if , for some _ positive _ @xmath74 , @xmath166 has an eigenvalue equal to one ( which corresponds to @xmath70 being periodic ) . in determining the conditions under which this occurs one is interested only in modes for which @xmath168 , or , equivalently , @xmath169 ^ 2 \\le [ \\lambda l/ ( 4 \\pi \\ncal)]^2   = \\wp $ ] , where @xmath170 and @xmath171 is the period of @xmath149 , defined above ; with appropriate choice of these parameters one can insure @xmath172 . in this case",
    "there are ranges of parameters where not destabilizing modes are present ; fig .",
    "[ fig : ii ] contains an example for fixed @xmath173 and @xmath174 where the matrix @xmath175 for @xmath176 , while fig .",
    "[ fig : iii ] gives , for fixed @xmath177 , the values of @xmath178 where no destabilizing modes occur ( within the allowed @xmath179 range ) .",
    "background configurations for this type of models are then stable in such cases .     when @xmath180 ( left ) and @xmath181 ( right ) in both cases @xmath182 , and the amplitude of @xmath174 equals @xmath183 .",
    "periodic solutions occur for @xmath184 and do not correspond to destabilizing modes.,width=576 ]     for which ( [ eq : av.eq ] ) has no destabilizing modes .",
    "light gray : @xmath185 and the amplitude of @xmath174 equals @xmath186 ; dark gray : @xmath187 and the amplitude of @xmath174 equals @xmath188 . in both cases @xmath189,width=288 ]    stable solutions occur when the number of scalar fields is @xmath190 ; i found no stable configurations in more economical models .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper was to provide mechanisms that can overcome the periodicity and stability problems of brane - like configurations produced by scalar fields .",
    "the model defined by ( [ eq : l.phi ] ) and ( [ eq : l.a ] ) meets these requirements by introducing a coupling of the scalars to the ricci scalar and to an antisymmetric tensor field that can propagate in the bulk . for appropriate choices of scalar potential",
    "the background configurations mimic that of the rs model but require the presence of @xmath191 scalar fields with modes of very different though commensurate periods ( an investigation of whether this hierarchy can be maintained naturally lies beyond the scope of this paper ) .    as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] these models contain a uv cutoff scale @xmath3 ; when @xmath2 is compact they also contain another high - energy scale , the compactification radius @xmath36 .",
    "an immediate concern is whether one can naturally assume @xmath192 , for otherwise the model can not accurately describe the dynamics associated with the compact directions .",
    "this question can be investigated using an extension of naive dimensional analysis @xcite .",
    "for example , a straightforward estimate for 5-dimensional gauge theories gives @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the 5-dimensional gauge coupling constant ( which is dimensional ) .",
    "the 4-dimensional gauge coupling is @xmath195 , whence @xmath196 , which indicates that such models are reliable at energies above the compactification scale provided @xmath197 . for compact @xmath2",
    "the scale @xmath198 also provides a cutoff for the order of the kk excitations that need to be included in the theory ; the effects of higher order modes are absorbed into a renormalization of the various operator coefficients .",
    "when the antisymmetric tensor field is introduced , additional constraints appear , such as , for example , those derived from the unitarity constraint in @xmath199 scattering , which demands ( at tree - level ) that the scale associated with @xmath128 be below @xmath200 ; this restriction also insures that the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : leff ] ) does not generate undesirable poles in the scalar propagators .    in the above models there are no exponentially destabilizing modes below scale @xmath3 .",
    "there _ are _ , however , zero modes obtained by taking derivatives with respect to the parameters of the background configuration ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : zero.modes ] ) .",
    "perturbations along these zero modes then correspond to small deformations of the background configuration parameters , under which its period and orbits suffer small changes , but and do not result in an instability .",
    "phenomenologically viable models constructed along these lines must include , in addition , the possibility of orbifolding . in this case it is most convenient to assume that the potential allows solutions with definite parity under @xmath201 .",
    "this can be implemented without additional complications .",
    "it is worth noting that the present models can not be stabilized by the 1-loop effective potential @xcite .",
    "this is because in the present case the tree - level potential @xmath106 supports at least one destabilizing mode ( whose amplitude increases exponentially with time ) , not merely a neutral one .",
    "loop corrections are of course present , but they are subdominant .",
    "when @xmath202 , the presence of a negative sign in @xmath62 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : def.of.s ] ) suggests an alternative description of the equations for @xmath77 as a geodesic equation , and that for @xmath203 as a geodesic deviation equation .    to see this",
    "consider an @xmath204-dimensional space with coordinates @xmath205 and metric _",
    "r s = diag ( m_1,m_2,  ,m_n,1/v ( ) ) .",
    "[ eq : met ] i will denote by @xmath9 etc . the indices corresponding to the first @xmath14 coordinates , then @xmath206 .",
    "the geodesic equations associated with this metric are = - v_r ( ) ^2 ;   = v _ r v_r ( ) ( ) ; where @xmath207 is an affine parameter .",
    "the second equation can be immediately integrated : @xmath208 where @xmath209 is a constant ; substituting into the equation for the @xmath210 gives 2c^2 = -v_r , that reduces to the second - order equation for @xmath77 in ( [ eq : back.0 ] ) provided @xmath7 is identified with @xmath211 .",
    "the zero - energy condition in ( [ eq : back.0 ] ) corresponds to the requirement that this be a null geodesic : _ rs _ rs + v ( ) ^2 = c^2 \\ {  m  + v ( ) } = 0 , where a prime denotes a @xmath7 derivative .",
    "it is also clear that the equation for @xmath203 is equivalent to the geodesic deviation equation associated with the metric ( [ eq : met ] ) .",
    "when there is a single scalar field the background solution takes the form & = & + /+ g _ & = & ( 1 - 2 /-2 /^2 + ) _ with @xmath212 .    for this simple case",
    "the field equation is redundant ; while the einstein equations give o ( ) : & & 2  - 3  = 0 , o(1 ) : & & v ( ) - m ^2 - ( 2 - 3  ) ^2 = 0 , & & 2  - 3  - 6  + 2   - ^2 + ( ^2 )  = 0 ,",
    "o(1/ ) : & & 4 ( 2- 3 )   -   + ( 8 - )   + 8   + v = 0 & & [ eq : spp ] (",
    "i omitted an additional equation to order @xmath213 that determines the correction of order @xmath214 to the metric ) , where     the @xmath215 equation together with the periodicity requirement imply @xmath216 constant , whence @xmath43 must satisfy m ^2 + v ( ) = 0 .",
    "[ eq : zero.energy ] it now proves convenient to write & = &  a(y ) , & = & f ( ) + 3 ( m - ) ^2 + b(y ) , substituting into ( [ eq : spp ] ) and using ( [ eq : zero.energy ] ) one finds & = & 3 ; a= m ; b  & = & 3 a   ; f  + v f + 3 = 0 ; where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "these equations can be solved by quadratures ; in particular , f ( ) = - _ 0^d_0^d .    higher orders can be dealt with similarly . for more than one field",
    "the higher - order corrections to ( [ eq : back.0 ] ) can not , in general , be cast into such comparatively simple expressions .",
