    "@xmath0 nuclei ( nuclear systems with a bound anti - kaon ) have recently become a hot topic in hadron and nuclear physics . with a phenomenological @xmath2 potential ,",
    "it was suggested that the @xmath0 nuclei could exist as deeply bound states with small width  @xcite .",
    "experiments performed in search for such states have so far been inconclusive  @xcite .",
    "an important prototype is the @xmath1 system , the simplest @xmath0-nuclear cluster .",
    "recently this system has been studied using faddeev  @xcite and variational  @xcite approaches with @xmath2 interactions constrained by scattering data and properties of the @xmath7 .    an essential ingredient to study @xmath0 nuclei",
    "is the @xmath2 interaction below threshold , which is only accessible through the subthreshold extrapolation of the amplitude adjusted to @xmath2 scattering data .",
    "theoretical guidance is required for this extrapolation . here",
    "we report on the study of a variational calculation of @xmath1 system  @xcite using the effective @xmath2 interaction based on chiral su(3 ) dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the present variational investigation focuses on the @xmath1 system with spin and parity @xmath9 and isospin @xmath10 , where the parity assignment includes the intrinsic parity of the antikaon .",
    "our model wave function for this @xmath1 state , @xmath11 , has two components : @xmath12_{t_n=1 } \\ , \\bar{k } \\ , \\right]_{t=1/2 , t_z=1/2 } \\right\\rangle , \\label{phi+ } \\\\ & & |\\phi_- \\rangle \\equiv    \\phi_- ( \\bm{r}_1 , \\bm{r}_2 , \\bm{r}_k )   \\ ; \\left| s_n = 0 \\right\\rangle   \\times \\ ; \\left| \\ , \\left [ \\ , [ nn]_{t_n=0 } \\ , \\bar{k } \\ , \\right]_{t=1/2 , t_z=1/2 } \\right\\rangle , \\label{phi-}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a normalization factor .",
    "the first , second and third terms in eqs .",
    "( [ phi+ ] ) and ( [ phi- ] ) correspond to the spatial wave function , the spin wave function of the two nucleons ( assuming @xmath14 ) , and the isospin wave function of the total system , respectively .",
    "we consider two different isospin states of the two nucleons ( @xmath15 in @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath18 ) , while the @xmath19 system in both cases has total isospin and third component @xmath10 .",
    "the dominant contribution is the @xmath15 component corresponding to the leading @xmath1 configuration .",
    "the mixing with the @xmath17 component is caused by the difference between the @xmath2 interactions in @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the spatial part of the wave functions are products of single particle wave packets and two - particle correlation functions .",
    "the @xmath22 correlation function permits an adequate treatment of a realistic @xmath22 potential with its strong short - range repulsion .",
    "the parameters in the model wave function are determined by minimization of the energy .",
    "the hamiltonian used in the present study is of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24(@xmath25 ) stands for the @xmath22(@xmath2 ) interaction . here",
    "@xmath26 is the total kinetic energy .",
    "the energy of the center - of - mass motion , @xmath27 , is subtracted . as a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath24 we choose the argonne v18 potential ( av18 )  @xcite .",
    "we employ the central , @xmath28 and spin - spin parts of the av18 potential for the singlet - even ( @xmath29 ) and singlet - odd ( @xmath30 ) channel , since the total spin of the two nucleons is restricted to zero in our model .",
    "we use the @xmath2 interaction @xmath25 derived from chiral su(3 ) dynamics  @xcite",
    ". this complex and energy - dependent interaction is parametrized by a gaussian spatial distribution : @xmath31 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the isospin projection operator for the @xmath2 pair . the interaction strength",
    "@xmath33 is a function of the center - of - mass energy variable @xmath34 of the @xmath2 subsystem . the strength @xmath35 and the range parameter @xmath36 are systematically determined within the chiral coupled - channel approach .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath2 interaction requires the self - consistency in the variational procedure  @xcite .",
    "we introduce an auxiliary ( non - observable ) antikaon  binding energy \" @xmath37 to control the energy @xmath34 of the @xmath2 subsystem within the @xmath1 cluster .",
    "this @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the nucleonic part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the relation between the @xmath2 two - body energy @xmath34 and @xmath37 within the three - body system is not @xmath40 @xmath41 fixed . in general , @xmath34 can take values @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a parameter describing the balance of the antikaon energy between the two nucleons of the @xmath19 three - body system .",
    "one expects @xmath44 .",
    "the upper limit ( @xmath45 ) corresponds to the case in which the antikaon field collectively surrounds the two nucleons , a situation encountered in the limit of static ( infinitely heavy ) nucleon sources . in the lower limit ( @xmath46 ) the antikaon energy is split symmetrically half - and - half between the two nucleons .",
    "we investigate both cases and label them  type i \" and  type ii \" , respectively : @xmath47 our calculation is then carried out such that self - consistency for @xmath34 is achieved , namely , the @xmath34 used in the effective @xmath2 potential is made to coincide with the @xmath34 evaluated with the finally obtained wave function .    due to the elimination of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 channels , the effective @xmath2 potential is complex .",
    "we perform the variational calculation with the real part of the potential to obtain the wave function .",
    "the decay width is then calculated perturbatively by taking the expectation value of the imaginary part of the potential : @xmath50 , which represents the mesonic decay channels ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the dispersive effect induced by the imaginary part of the potential and the non - mesonic absorption width for @xmath52 are treated separately .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]      here we present the results of the variational calculation . for an estimate of theoretical uncertainties , we have used four effective @xmath2 potentials derived from different versions of chiral models , and employed both the type i and the type ii ansatz , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all cases",
    "the @xmath1 system turns out to be rather weakly bound as compared to previous calculations . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the total binding energies range from 17 mev to 23 mev , and the mesonic decay width @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) lies between 40 and 70 mev .",
    "the different versions of the chiral models give similar results within a relatively small window of uncertainties , while type ii ansatz gives slightly deeper binding than type i by a few mev .",
    "the reason for the shallow binding is found in the relatively weak @xmath2 potentials based on chiral dynamics .",
    "the chiral low energy theorem in the su(3 ) meson - baryon sector dictates strong @xmath48 attraction , and the coupled - channel dynamics locates the resonance structure in the @xmath2 amplitude at 1420 mev , displaced from the 1405 mev measured in the @xmath48 spectrum .",
    "the binding energy of the isolated @xmath6 system is about 12 mev measured from @xmath2 threshold .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] shows a typical result of @xmath1 calculated with a chiral model  @xcite and the type i ansatz .",
    "the results of the other cases under study are essentially the same .",
    "the mean distance between two nucleons , @xmath56 , is about 2.2 fm which is smaller than that of the deuteron ( about 4 fm ) and close to the @xmath22 distance in normal nuclei , but the system is obviously not much compressed .",
    "it is interesting to compare the @xmath6 component in @xmath1 with the @xmath7 as the @xmath6 two - body quasibound state .",
    "the mean distance of the @xmath2 pair in @xmath1 is found to be close to that for @xmath7 , namely @xmath57 fm and @xmath58 fm . calculating the expectation value of the relative @xmath2 orbital angular momentum",
    ", it turns out that the @xmath6 pair is dominated by @xmath59-wave , just as the @xmath2 pair forming the @xmath7 .",
    "the structure of the @xmath6 pair in the @xmath1 system is thus similar to that of the @xmath7 .",
    "the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the @xmath2 relative density distribution of @xmath60 and 1 ) components extracted from @xmath1 which are normalized to compare with that of @xmath7 .",
    "apparently , the distribution of @xmath6 pair in @xmath1 is very similar to that of the @xmath2 two - body quasibound state .",
    "cc|cc|cc||cc b. e. ( @xmath1 ) & @xmath61 & @xmath56 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & b. e. ( @xmath65 ) & @xmath66 + 16.9 & 47.0 & 2.21 & 1.97 & 1.82 & 2.33 & 11.5 & 1.86 +      based on the wavefunction obtained above , we estimate the following contributions to the results which have not been taken into account so far : 1 ) dispersive corrections by the imaginary part of the potential , 2 ) effect of the @xmath8-wave @xmath2 interaction , and 3 ) decay width from the two - nucleon absorption process  @xcite .",
    "first , we consider the dispersive correction induced by the imaginary part of the @xmath2 potential .",
    "this effect can be calculated explicitly for the two - body @xmath2 system , by comparing the bound state solution of the real part of the potential with the resonance structure observed in the scattering amplitude with original complex potential .",
    "examining four chiral models , we find an attractive shift of the binding energy @xmath67 mev in the two - body @xmath2 system .",
    "we therefore estimate that the dispersive correction would add another @xmath68 mev to the binding energy of the @xmath1 system .",
    "secondly , the contribution of the @xmath8-wave @xmath2 interaction is estimated perturbatively with the @xmath8-wave @xmath2 interaction : @xmath69\\ , \\nabla~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficient @xmath70 is complex and a detailed expression is given in ref .",
    "a prominent feature in the @xmath8-wave interaction is the @xmath71 resonance below the threshold .",
    "since the @xmath1 system is weakly bound and the energy variable @xmath34 lies slightly above the @xmath71 resonance , the @xmath8-wave contribution to the binding energy is repulsive , about @xmath72 mev .",
    "the decay width is increased by 10 @xmath73 35 mev , because of the large imaginary part around the @xmath71 resonance structure .",
    "next , we estimate the contribution of the two - nucleon absorption process ( non - mesonic decay width , @xmath74 ) . the width is calculated with the correlated three - body density @xmath75 as @xmath76 this is a generalization of the formula for @xmath77 absorption on proton pairs in a heavy nucleus , where the coupling constant is constrained by a global fit to the kaonic atom data  @xcite . for the application to the few - body system ,",
    "we modify the delta function type interaction to the finite range gaussian form .",
    "this procedure is necessary to account for short range correlations of the nucleons in the few - body system , and physically motivated by the underlying mechanism of the meson - exchange picture . using the correlation density obtained from the wave function of the @xmath1 ,",
    "the two nucleon absorption width is estimated to be 4 - 12 mev .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath1 system with a variational method , employing a realistic @xmath22 potential ( av18 potential ) and an effective @xmath2 potential based on chiral su(3 ) dynamics . with theoretical uncertainties in the model , the binding energy and decay width of",
    "the @xmath1 turns out to be @xmath78 as a consequence of the strong @xmath79 interaction in chiral scheme , the strength of the @xmath2 interaction is reduced and therefore we find a weakly bound state .",
    "the @xmath6 pair in the obtained wave function of the @xmath1 system exhibits a similar structure as the @xmath2 two - body quasibound state in vacuum .",
    "we have estimated corrections , such as dispersive correction , the @xmath8-wave @xmath2 potential , and the two - nucleon absorption process . taking these effects into account , the total binding energy increases slightly and the total decay width becomes as large as 60 - 120 mev .",
    "our result should be compared with another three - body faddeev calculation with chiral interaction  @xcite , where the @xmath1 state was found with 80 mev binding energy . while faddeev approach treats the coupled channels explicitly , our variational calculation works by eliminating the @xmath80 channel .",
    "although the two - body @xmath48 dynamics is fully incorporated in the effective @xmath2 interaction , the dynamics of @xmath81 three - body system may generate additional attraction ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the coupled - channel framework ,",
    "the obtained state is the mixture of the @xmath19 and @xmath80 components , as the @xmath7 resonance in @xmath2-@xmath48 system . in this sense ,",
    "our strategy is to focus on the @xmath19 component , and the present framework may not be sensitive to the @xmath80 component .",
    "based on a recent experimental analysis , a broad structure at about 100 mev below the @xmath19 threshold is reported  @xcite , the maximum of which coincides with the @xmath80 threshold . in the chiral framework , such a broad state in the deep subthreshold region would be interpreted in terms of @xmath80 dynamics , driven by the strong @xmath48 attraction .",
    "the present investigation is however not capable to deal with the @xmath80 component , since we have eliminated this channel .",
    "while the new report  @xcite is an interesting observation , more careful analysis is needed to answer the question about its detailed structure .",
