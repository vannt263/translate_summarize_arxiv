    "however the heavy partons in this jet are not as energetic as in a pure @xmath16 production and , consequently , the proposed factorization between long and short distance effects may not longer apply , allowing for an interference between both regimes . in this case",
    "we can not argue that these kind of cut diagrams would result in a final state with q  flavoured hadrons with unit probability , although we may impose kinematical constraints to reduce uncertainties in both the experimental reconstruction of data and theoretical cross section of these @xmath61 states .",
