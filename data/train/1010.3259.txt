    "blazars are very bright from radio frequencies to gamma - ray energies @xcite due to the alignment of their jets with respect to the line of sight of the observer @xcite .",
    "relativistic beaming in these outflows @xcite enhances the observed flux and shortens the variability timescales .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) typically shows a non - thermal two - component structure .",
    "the low - energy emission is generally believed to be produced through synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons . in contrast , the nature of the high - energy component is still being debated .",
    "a possible explanation is that the same electron population that is responsible for the low - energy component generates the high - energy component through compton scattering @xcite .",
    "alternative explanations are proton - initiated cascades @xcite or proton - synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic protons @xcite .",
    "the position of the synchrotron peak defines two classes of bl lac objects : high frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbl , peak at uv  x - ray frequencies ) and low frequency peaked bl lac objects ( lbl , peak in the ir  optical band ) .",
    "1es  1959 + 650 , at z = 0.046 @xcite , is one of the best - studied member of the former group .",
    "it was first detected at x - rays during the slew survey of _",

    "the blazar was also detected at @xmath0-rays by egret @xcite .",
    "very recently , the source was included in the _ fermi _ first catalog of active galactic nucleus ( agn;@xcite ) .",
    "1es  1959 + 650 was observed several times at tev energies @xcite . on 2002",
    "june 4 , followed by the detection of a strong tev @xmath0-ray flare of the source with the 10 m whipple erenkov telescope , target of opportunity observations in optical and x - rays were performed . despite an increased activity in the @xmath0rays ,",
    "no flux variation was detected in x - rays @xcite during simultaneous observations by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte)_. as a possible explanation , a hadronic synchrotron - mirror model has been suggested by @xcite , but this suffers from rather extreme energy requirements @xcite .",
    "hence , the origin of the orphan tev flare is at present not understood .",
    "it is therefore important to monitor the synchrotron and inverse - compton components simultaneously .    in this letter",

    "we show non simultaneous archive hegra iact data @xcite , when the source showed a major outburst ( in 2002 ) .",
    "such activity at tev energies was not reported during our multifrequency campaign in 2007 .",
    "therefore these data are not used to constrain our sed model .    given the lack of variability on short and long timescales , we used the average values in each energy band to construct the sed .",
    "the sed of 1es  1959 + 650 shows the typical two - component structure of an hbl ( figure [ fig : fig02 ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron peak can be constrained by the xrt spectrum ( @xmath7 @xmath2 2 , see table  [ tab : fit ] ) , whereas the hard x - ray ",
    "soft @xmath0-ray data constrain the onset of the high - energy component .",
    "indeed , the log - parabolic fit model for the synchrotron emission is not able to reproduce the jointly fitted xrt and ibis / isgri data ( see fit result in table  [ tab : fit ] ) .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that the ibis / isgri spectrum represents the onset of the high - energy component .",
    "the high - energy peak is very poorly constrained due to the lack of simultaneous @xmath0-ray data . during its first year of survey , the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) detects the source in quiescence state @xcite . therefore the power output measured by lat is not comparable to the power output in the same energy range inferred with our model that refers to an active state of the source .",
    "the lat measurement is a factor @xmath26 lower .",
    "fermi_-lat observations are taken @xmath21 year after our multifrequency campaign of 2007 .",
    "the data are modeled by a pure leptonic ssc model ( see figure  [ fig : fig02 ] black solid line ) , using the equilibrium version of the code of @xcite , as described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the emitting region is a spherical volume @xmath8 of radius @xmath9 in the comoving frame .",
    "it moves with respect to the observer with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath10 ( speed @xmath11c ) at an angle @xmath12 , resulting in relativistic beaming determined by the doppler factor .",
    "ultrarelativistic leptons are injected into the emission region with a power - law distribution ( in the comoving frame ) : @xmath13 \\ ; \\ ;   { \\rm for } \\;\\ ; \\gamma_1 \\le \\gamma \\le \\gamma_2 \\label{qe}\\ ] ] where the normalization is determined by the injection power @xmath14 .",
    "the code finds a self - consistent equilibrium between particle injection , radiative cooling due to synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) losses and particle escape on a timescale @xmath15 .",
    "the effect of @xmath16 absorption by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) is taken into account using the model of @xcite .",
    "the fit is constrained by the synchrotron component from the optical to x - rays as well as the onset of the ssc component at hard x - rays  soft @xmath0-rays .",
    "the hard synchrotron spectrum as well as the unusually high level of the low - frequency end of the ssc component ( see figure [ fig : fig02 ] ) requires the choice of a very hard injection spectrum with a slope of @xmath17 .",
    "the optical data point from the palomar observations were taken up to 10 days after the x - ray and uv pointings with xrt and uvot respectively .",
    "they can not be reconciled with our model sed .",
    "this is not surprising , as variability by a factor of @xmath18 on timescales of weeks is not uncommon in this object @xcite .",
    "the parameters used for the fit shown in figure [ fig : fig02 ] are listed in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the equilibrium particle distribution found by the code corresponds to a kinetic power in relativistic electrons of @xmath19 erg  s@xmath6 , while the magnetic field of @xmath20  g yields to a power in poynting flux of @xmath21 erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "hence , the magnetic field energy density is a factor @xmath22 below equipartition .",
    "the hard injection index of @xmath17 ( constrained by the mere synchrotron component ) is inconsistent with standard first - order fermi acceleration at relativistic shocks , which predicts an index of @xmath23  2.3 @xcite .",
    "this might indicate a substantial contribution to particle acceleration from second - order fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion was also reached when modeling the very hard x - ray and _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray spectrum of the hbl rgb  j0710 + 591 , recently detected at very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-rays by veritas .    as an alternative to the pure leptonic model",
    ", we have applied a semi - analytical lepto - hadronic model shown by the orange solid line in figure [ fig : fig02 ] .",
    "this model assumes , in addition to a leptonic component similar to the one used for the leptonic model described above , a power - law population of relativistic protons extending out to energies beyond the threshold for p@xmath0 pion production on the electron - synchrotron radiation field .",
    "the production rates of final decay products ( electrons , positrons , @xmath24 decay photons , and neutrinos ) are calculated using the analytical templates of @xcite .",
    "synchrotron emission of secondaries is calculated using a @xmath25 approximation .",
    "the @xmath24 decay photons as well as synchrotron emission from the first - generation pairs from charged pion decay are produced predominantly at @xmath26  tev energies , at which the emission region is highly opaque to @xmath16 absorption .",
    "therefore , the radiative power at those energies is redistributed to lower frequencies through electromagnetic cascades .",
    "we employ a semi - analytical treatment of the cascading process as described in @xcite .",
    "the inferred parameters are reported in tabel [ tab : parameters ] , and they are in good agreement with the leptonic model .",
    "we have performed a multiwavelength campaign on 1es  1959 + 650 in 2007 .",
    "this is the first and only detection by ibis / isgri of the source .",
    "the source was monitored nearly simultaneously from optical to hard x - ray energies . in the optical to uv band",
    "the most evident flux variations are of the order of 20% on inter - day timescales . at hard x - rays",
    "the source flux stayed constant .",
    "the compiled sed allowed us to derive the physical parameters of the source .",
    "the sed clearly shows the simultaneous detection of both the synchrotron and the rise of the high - energy ( inverse - compton ) emission components .",
    "this is the first time that the transition region between the synchrotron and inverse - compton components is detected for 1es  1959 + 650 , and has so far been measured only for a few other bl lac objects of intermediate type .",
    "the best example is on 231 @xcite which is an intermediate bl lac object ( ibl ) .",
    "these objects are characterized by seds peaking at frequencies intermediate to lbl and hbl .",
    "other examples , not as clear as the previous one , are pks 2155 - 304 @xcite , another ibl , and s5 0716 + 714 @xcite , an lbl .",
    "@xcite suggest that the source is in a continuous high active state and only seldom lowers its activity shifting the position of the peak of the synchrotron emission to lower frequencies .",
    "for hbl objects , the synchrotron peak is located usually at soft x - ray energies and exceptionally at hard x - ray energies , thus making the descending branch of the synchrotron component and the ascending branch of the inverse - compton component difficult or impossible to measure .",
    "this interesting hard x - ray regime ( 20  kev",
    " 1  mev ) is important since the two emission components are competing : higher fluxes translate into harder spectra indicating changes in the injected particle population . in turn",
    "this gives clues on the jet physics and its composition .",
    "monitoring the hard x - ray to @xmath0-ray domain allows to trace the evolution of the emission mechanism .",
    "this can be performed by instruments with higher sensitivity as could be grips @xcite , a future @xmath0-ray mission proposed to the european space agency .",
    "we reproduced the observed sed with a simple one - zone , leptonic ssc model and with a lepto - hadronic model . both models required a very hard electron injection spectrum with an index of @xmath17 and @xmath27 for the leptonic and lepto - hadronic models respectively .",
    "this requirement might indicate the importance of second - order fermi acceleration mechanisms in the energization of ultrarelativistic particles in the jet of 1es  1959 + 650 .",
