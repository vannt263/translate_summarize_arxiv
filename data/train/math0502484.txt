    "in particular , this answers the open problem mentioned in the last two lines of @xcite .",
    "the precise result is the following :    [ main ] fix a probability vector @xmath33 , and fix @xmath59 .",
    "there exists a measurable subset @xmath60 and a finitary translation - equivariant map @xmath8 , such that for any probability vector @xmath25 for which @xmath61 for all @xmath27 and @xmath62 , @xmath24 is a finitary homomorphism from @xmath39 to @xmath40 with exponential tails .",
    "here is a brief description of the motivation and method of the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "a homomorphism can be thought of as a translation - equivariant function that , given a sequence of independent samples with distribution @xmath32 , simulates a sequence of independent samples with distribution @xmath38 .",
    "thus , it is natural to try to construct such a function using existing constructions of functions that simulate one discrete distribution using another .",
    "such constructions have been described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our construction combines elements from several of these constructions .",
    "first , divide the source sequence @xmath63 into * blocks * separated by * markers*. a marker is defined as an appearance of a certain ( sufficiently rare ) pattern , say a 2 followed by @xmath64 1 s , where @xmath64 is a large enough integer .",
    "next , feed the contents of each block into a specially designed function which converts these approximately independent @xmath32-distributed samples into independent unbiased bits .",
    "next , at each block , start feeding these unbiased bits into another function designed to generate a number of independent samples of the distribution @xmath38 sufficient to fill the length of that block .",
    "this function may require more bits than that block contains , but on the average , because of entropy considerations it requires less .",
    "any unused bits are then used to satisfy blocks whose simulation did not end in the first round .",
    "continuing in this manner one obtains the required number of samples of @xmath38 , which are then used to generate the value @xmath65 .",
    "everything is done simultaneously for all blocks in a translation equivariant manner , with an added bonus being the source universality property .",
    "the following is an extension of theorem [ main ] to markov chains .",
    "[ markov ] let @xmath66 , @xmath67 be two aperiodic , irreducible markov transition matrices over the finite alphabets @xmath68 .",

    "we indicate in section 5 how our methods may be adapted to prove theorem [ markov ] .",
    "for markov chains , our construction is not source - universal , except in the weak sense that it will work , under the assumption of an entropy gap , simultaneously for all markov transition matrices with all entries positive  see section 5 .",
    "in this section , we construct two procedures for simulating one discrete distribution from another .",
    "the constructions are variants of those used by elias @xcite , han and hoshi @xcite , knuth and yao @xcite , and romik @xcite . in all of these constructions ,",

    "second , it is necessary to replace the function @xmath189 that produces independent unbiased bits from a pattern - free bernoulli block with a new function , @xmath585 designed to do the same for a pattern - free markov block conditioned to begin with a `` 1 '' ( which we assume without loss of generality to be the last symbol in the left marker ) and to end with a `` 2 '' ( the first symbol in the right marker ) .",
    "note that the construction of @xmath189 used only the symmetries of the distribution @xmath158 , namely the fact that the space @xmath152 can be partitioned into classes of equiprobable elements , since the probability of an element only depends on the count of the different @xmath141-symbols , and not on the order of their appearance .    for a markov source , the probability of an element in @xmath152 will depend on the count of adjacent _ pairs _ of symbols .",
    "thus , there will again be classes of equiprobable elements .",
    "the number of classes , which bounds the range of the complementary function @xmath586 ( and hence the amount of lost entropy  see the proof of lemma [ tvalue ] ) , is at most @xmath587 .",
    "all the proofs carry through identically to the bernoulli case .",
    "things get more complicated when the target process is markov . here , it is not enough for each block to independently generate the @xmath34-symbols required to fill its spaces , since one must make sure that there are the correct transition probabilities on the boundaries between blocks .",
    "we propose the following solution to this problem .",
    "first , we need a process version of theorem [ simu1 ] .",
    "that is , given a sequence of random variables @xmath588 , not necessarily independent , taking values in a finite alphabet @xmath34 , one may construct a sequence of simulations @xmath589 , such that the stopping times @xmath590 are increasing , and for each @xmath229 , @xmath591 is a simulation of the distribution of @xmath592 from independent unbiased bits .",
    "each simulation is efficient , in the sense of theorem [ simu1](ii ) .",
    "the proof is obvious , by successively refining the partition @xmath593 of @xmath594 used in the proof of theorem [ simu1 ] .",
    "since the markov matrix @xmath72 is irreducible and aperiodic , there exists an @xmath595 for which all the entries of @xmath596 are positive . for",
    "each block @xmath239 , the @xmath229-th simulator will start by generating , using the independent unbiased bits @xmath238 at her disposal ( and , if necessary , bits from the blocks to her right ) , @xmath597 separate markov trajectories of length @xmath598 , @xmath599 , such that for each @xmath600 , @xmath601 is a finite markov chain that starts with the symbol @xmath224 and has transition probabilities given by the matrix @xmath72 .",
    "we call these finite chains the * * preamble chains",
    ". one of them will later be chosen to fill the first @xmath598 places in the @xmath229-th block , but at the moment we do nt know which .",
    "next , we want the @xmath229-th simulator to compute symbols to fill the remainder of her block .",
    "this can be done if in the sequences @xmath602 , * * coupling was achieved , i.e. , if all the symbols @xmath603 are identical ; since in this case , no matter which of the preamble chains we later choose , we will need the same conditional distribution to compute the @xmath604-th symbol in the block , then the @xmath605-th , and so on .",
    "because of our choice of @xmath598 , we know that coupling is achieved with a positive probability . so a positive proportion of the simulators will be able to continue and compute symbols to fill their blocks , using the nested simulations described above .",
    "but each simulator that filled her block , also determined for the block to her right which of the preamble chains to use - the one that corresponds to the last symbol in the block that was filled . for each block for which the preamble was determined in this second round of computations",
    ", one may now proceed to simulate the remainder of the block .",
    "this then determines the preamble of more blocks , for which the block remainder is then computed . by iterating this process ,",
    "the choice of preamble chains is propagated to the right until a single output sequence is determined .",
    "the computation of the preamble chains uses a fixed amount of entropy per block .",
    "since the blocks may be made arbitrarily large in expectation by choosing a long enough marker , the loss in entropy can be made negligible .",
    "the computation of the remainder of each block uses nested simulations , which are efficient .",
    "therefore it can be shown that the total entropy loss is small , and the simulation will terminate a.s .",
    "the output sequence is clearly a stationary process , and by the construction its transition probabilities are exactly given by the transition matrix @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , it is the stationary markov shift @xmath76 .",
    "the construction is a finitary homomorphism , which can be shown to have exponential tails using large - deviations estimates similarly to the bernoulli case .",
    "do there exist source - universal finitary _",
    "isomorphisms _ ?",
    "more specifically , if the bernoulli sources @xmath606 all have equal entropy , does there exist a finitary map ( as defined in the introduction ) which is simultaneously a finitary isomorphism from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and from @xmath607 to @xmath40 ?",
    "* if the function is not required to be a finitary map , the answer to the above question is positive , for a trivial reason .",
    "the function can simply use the law of large numbers to discern whether the input is in the almost - sure set of @xmath39 or of @xmath607 , and apply one of two keane - smorodinsky @xcite finitary isomorphisms accordingly .",
