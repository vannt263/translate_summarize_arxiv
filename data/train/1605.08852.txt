    "consider the following problem : suppose @xmath0 is an unknown function , given observations of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a set of independent functions with the property of partition of unity(pou ) , i.e. , @xmath3 , we want to estimate the value @xmath4 with respect to a different set of independent functions @xmath5 . if we require @xmath6 to have a better regularity , then the classical pointwise interpolation problem is just a special case of such a formulation by setting @xmath7 and @xmath8 for two different point sets @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dirac delta function .    in this paper , we focus on the case that @xmath12 is the characteristic function for @xmath13 and @xmath13 is an element of a tessellation / mesh @xmath14 of @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 is the characteristic function on @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is an element of another tessellation @xmath19 of @xmath20 .",
    "such a generalised interpolation problem arises when it is required to transfer information from the old tessellation to a new one . for example , in the arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian(ale ) method @xcite , or a moving mesh method , when the old tessellation becomes poor or severely distorted , one has to rezoning the tessellation and to map physical data on an old tessellation to a new one .",
    "the process of transfer the physical variables based on the observations @xmath21 , @xmath22 , on an old mesh @xmath23 to @xmath24 , @xmath25 , on a new mesh @xmath26 , is referred to as _",
    "remapping_.    as one of the three main steps in the ale framework , remapping has kept researchers busy in the past decades .",
    "currently there are two main streams of remapping schemes : one is the _ cell - intersection - based donor cell(cib / dc)_. such an approach is conceptually simple ; the information @xmath27 is aggregated from intersections between old cells and the new cells :    @xmath28    once this information is aggregated exactly , then the conservative property of the generalised interpolation follows due to the property of partition of unity :    @xmath29    such an approach based on set or support intersection operation is also referred to as _ aggregated intersection based donor cell(aib / dc ) _ method .",
    "the remapping error depends only on the approximation / reconstruction of the density function on the old cells whenever the integral over the overlays between the old and new cells is computed exactly .",
    "precisely , piecewise constant reconstruct of the density function on the old cell grantees first order accuracy and convergence and piecewise linear construction grantees second order accuracy according to the standard approximation theory .",
    "dukowicz in @xcite considered applying the gauss divergence theory to calculate the overlap(s ) between an old cell and a new one .",
    "his procedure requires to transform a physical general quadrilateral meshes to the standard regular grid .",
    "ramshaw in @xcite improves dukowicz result , the improved method works on the physical mesh directly without any coordinate transform . a first order three dimensional remapping scheme based on intersecting arbitrary polyhedra was consider by grandy @xcite and azarenok @xcite .",
    "these approaches are first order methods .",
    "dukowicz pointed out that the first order cib / dc based remmapping scheme is equivalent to upwind difference of the advective term of a continuous equation @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "dukowicz and baumgardner articulated this equivalence .",
    "second order cib / dc methods were constructed by using piecewise linear reconstruction of the density function on the old cells @xcite .",
    "when the mass in a new cell are calculated by mass transfer from an old cell through the overlapped regions , the cib / dc approach is also referred to as the _ flux - intersection - based _ approach ( generalised flux in fact ) .",
    "this approach surfers from programming difficulties as we shall demonstrate , but it works for all kinds of tessellations . in particular , it is still used when _",
    "mixed cells_(cells contains several materials ) appear @xcite .",
    "the other method is the _ faced - based donor - cell(fb / dc ) method _ or the _ swept - region based methods_. in such an approach , the mass transfer between _ a home / departing cell _ and a _",
    "target / arriving cell _ is calculated by surface integral(line integral in @xmath30 ) according to the green formula or the divergence theory .",
    "the transfer is based on the _ fluxing area or swept region _ between the arriving / target cell and neighbouring cells of the home cell .",
    "dukowicz and baumgardner shows how the mass exchanges between a home cell and a target cell @xcite .",
    "in such an approach , there is flexibility to approximate the the transferred mass , the mass in the swept region is not necessarily calculated exactly , simplification and neat approximation to the flux bring efficient and high order methods , see @xcite@xcite for details . and",
    "it is easier to generalize into three dimensional space compared with the cib / dc approach .",
    "see @xcite for example .",
    "such an approach is also referred to the _ flux - based / face - based _ method .",
    "it is valid when the lagrangian and rezoned mesh have the same connectivity and are close to each other .",
    "the fb / dc approach is simpler for the cib / dc methods due to the _ degeneracy of the intersections_. increasing the robustness of a cib / dc methods requires a special procedure to handle such degeneracies .",
    "some authors believe the cib / dc approach is very complicated .",
    "this argument is basically true but is mathematical imprecise , because as we shall see similar degeneracy also arise for the fb / dc method . for both method ,",
    "neglecting such degeneracy will result flawed procedure .",
    "the ability to handle such degeneracy decides the robustness of a remapping procedure .    while the techniques vary between the two class methods , the essence of these mapping schemes is to compute or approximate the transfer of mass between a",
    "home cell or departing cell _ in the old tessellation and a _ target cell or arriving cell _ in the new tessellation . in the cib / dc approach , this mass transfer is equivalent to computing the integration / quadrature on the intersections .",
    "calculating the cell intersections and a proper quadrature rule ( in terms of volumetric or surface integral ) severs as the mathematical foundation of this approach .",
    "in the fb / dc method , calculating the _ fluxing / swept area _ between the old faces and a good reconstruction on the faces and vertices is critical . since the density function @xmath31 is usually approximated by piecewise functions on the old tessellation .",
    "lower regularity appears on the faces of the old tessellation .",
    "therefore , accurate computing the remapped mass or other physical variables requires summarize the underlying quantity piecewisely on the overlapped regions in the old tessellation to avoid singularity .",
    "that is why an exact remapping scheme requires to calculate the intersections or the swept / fluxing area between the old and new mesh",
    ". we shall mention that calculating or approximation the overlapped regions between the old and new tessellations and a reconstruction scheme ( for the density function or flux ) are two aspects of an remapping scheme .",
    "there are intensive discussion on reconstruction scheme , see @xcite and reference therein , while there are relative sparse discussion on how to calculate the overlapped regions except a couple of noticeable examples @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to articulate the mathematical formulation of these problems , present detailed classification of intersection types between a quadrilateral and another , and provide simple method to calculate the intersections between two quadrilateral mesh of the same connectivity based on the classification .",
    "the classification is simper and clearer than that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , table i ) .",
    "according the classification , one can quickly identify a degeneracy when it may arise .",
    "this helps to develop a robust software . when there is non degeneracy of the overlapped region , we demonstrate that the present approach only requires 34 programming cases(17 when considering symmetry ) , while the cib / dc approach used as in @xcite requires 98 programming cases(neither dukowicz nor ramshaw gave this quantitative result , the number is derived from fig .",
    "[ fig : cswap ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : branch ] in this paper and fig.1 in @xcite ) . when consider degeneracy , more benefit can be obtained .",
    "we shall demonstrates how the degeneracy of the intersection depends the so called _ singular intersection points _ , and how the computational amount depends on the singular intersection points .",
    "as far as we known this is the first result on how the computational complexity depends on an underlying problem .",
