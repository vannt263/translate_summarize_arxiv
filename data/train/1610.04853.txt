    "open star clusters ( oscs ) are excellent tools to understand the galactic evolutionary processes and dynamics of the stellar evolution .",
    "furthermore , oscs are dynamically associated groups of stars , which are bound to each other through the weak gravitation and located approximately at the same distance @xcite .",
    "the main sequence ( ms ) of * clusters * is used for determining their parameters / information / facts .",
    "each stellar sequence provides the evolutionary history of born stars from the same parent molecular cloud .",
    "recently , @xcite found separate sequences of the cluster and field .",
    "they have correlated the mass function slope of dolidze 14 with incompleteness of the data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimated the basic physical parameters of the cluster ngc 110 .",
    "they also separated the field stars from the cluster region by utilizing the combined effort of dynamical and statistical cleaning processes .",
    "furthermore , they found stellar enhancement for extracted stars from the ppmxl catalogue @xcite .",
    "although , the distance , age and reddening of studied cluster ( ngc 110 ) are estimated through 2mass @xcite data .",
    "the center coordinates ( ra , dec ) of studied cluster ngc 110 are estimated by @xcite , which comes as ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite estimated the center of ngc 110 as @xmath4 .",
    "the radius of the cluster ngc 110 is obtained to be @xmath5 by @xcite .",
    "the various parameters of ngc 110 are listed in the table[tab0 ] .",
    "a detailed membership analysis of each cluster becomes a robust investigative process to determine their properties @xcite .",
    "+    .the known physical parameters of the cluster ngc 110 under study .",
    "[ tab0 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the detection of fainter stars of the cluster region decreases with the increasing effective wavelength of the photometric bands . by the comparison of lfs of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 band , it is concluded that the fainter stars of the cluster region are showing continuously a disappearance towards the longer wavelength .",
    "furthermore , this result also weights our conclusion that the dynamical processes of the stars of the cluster are occurring in such a way that most of the radiant energy of the cluster may be radiated below the effective wavelength of the ir range .",
    "the sudden and sharp decrements of the stellar number of the last magnitude bin of the lf of the @xmath1 photometric band may provide complementary result for our hypothesis .",
    "it is well known fact that the proto - stars emit radiation in the ir range .",
    "the rdps of figure 1 indicates that the stellar enhancement occurred due to the detected stars in the optical bands instead of the detected stars in the ir bands .",
    "this stellar enhancement may depend on the values of msf , whereas msf depends on the incompleteness of the data as prescribed in subsection [ msf ] . in this old cluster ( @xmath8 ) , stellar enhancement found due to fainter stars and region",
    "may fulfilled by the stellar dust .",
    "the ir radiation is easily transmitted from dusty environment , whereas the visual radiation is * obscured * by dust particle or interstellar clouds .",
    "the dip in rdps of the ir range indicates that minimum ir - excesses stars are available in core compare to corona and field region .",
    "thus , large fraction of fainter stars is not detected within the core , which is contradictory * to the * cluster behaviour , whereas rdp of detected stars ( minimum in two bands ) supported its cluster behaviour . since , * most * oscs are too far away therefore too faint to be observable @xcite .",
    "similarly , a substantial portion of open clusters is hidden behind interstellar material in the galaxy plane @xcite .",
    "so , this system is considered to be either group of fainter stars or data fluctuation due to ppmxl photometry .",
    "+ the rdps of optical bands of cluster ( depicted in figure 1 ) provides the different values of radius , core radius and limiting radius , which are summarized in the table 2 .",
    "the absolute distance modulus and colour - excess , @xmath9 , of cluster are estimated as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the best fit theoretical isochrone on @xmath12 cmd of ngc 110 yielded a distance of @xmath13 for the cluster . on the behalf of figure 7 ,",
    "* we are concluding * that present lf study of the cluster does not support * to study the mass * function and the mass segregation . since , this stellar system is * containing * those stars which are emitting more energy in the visual bands instead of ir ,",
    "therefore , the ultraviolet photometric study of this cluster is needed .",
    "the mean - proper motion of ngc 110 in * its * ra and dec directions was estimated as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . according to table 4 ,",
    "the proper motions of cluster and field regions * are * similar in the various radial zones ; which indicates that this cluster is merging with surrounding field region .",
    "we have strongly emphasized that the deep @xmath16 photometry of this system is required due to the poor photometric quality of @xmath2 catalogue .",
