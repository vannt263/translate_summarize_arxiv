    "this problem has led to the development of a number of ways to extend the loop expansion in gauge theories at finite temperature , among which are approaches based on the schwinger ",

    "this model is chosen because it has some qualitative similarities to yang  mills theory .",
    "they showed that when a certain set of ladder graphs are included the pressure is finite in the infrared limit .",
    "given the fundamental importance of this conclusion , it is of some interest to examine to what degree the finite nature of the calculation is dependent on the approximations used .",
    "the purpose of this note is to study this question .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ af ]",
    "we set up a general framework for the calculation of the self  energy in the model , and show what approximations are used within this framework to obtain the results of almeida and frenkel @xcite .",
    "section [ other ] contains a discussion of four related variations of these approximations , which differ basically by including different approximations to the full propagator and vertex functions .",
    "we find that these different approximations lead to a quantitative difference with the results of almeida and frenkel @xcite , but the conclusion of the finite nature of the result in the infrared limit remains the same .",
    "section [ end ] contains some brief concluding remarks .",
    "the pressure in a field theory can be calculated by finding the self  energy function and using the fundamental relation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the free propagator and only one  particle  irreducible graphs",
    "are included in the self ",
    "energy function @xmath4 . to calculate this self ",
    "energy for @xmath5 theory in 6 dimensions we consider the schwinger ",
    "dyson equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an infrared cutoff , @xmath8 is the full inverse propagator , @xmath9 is the full 3point function , and we have taken the high temperature limit so that only the @xmath10 term in the matsubara frequency sum contributes .",
    "consider now the approximation @xmath11 under this assumption , eq .",
    "( [ sd ] ) becomes @xmath12 if we now make the further approximations @xmath13 and define @xmath14 eq .",
    "( [ frenkel ] ) becomes @xmath15 this equation was derived by almeida and frenkel @xcite , who show , analytically , that the solution for @xmath16 is finite in the infrared limit @xmath17 .",
    "this result demonstrates that , using the approximations discussed above , the pressure is finite in the infrared limit .",
    "in this section we explore approximations other than eqs .",
    "( [ fra ] ) ,  ( [ log ] ) in solving the schwinger dyson equation ( [ sd ] ) .",
    "we consider two distinct questions : what happens if we do nt make the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) for the logarithmic terms , and what happens if we use a non ",
    "trivial 3point interaction . as these approximations will require a numerical solution , in the following we choose @xmath18 .",
    "we first explore what happens if we do nt make the approximations of eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) to the logarithmic term of eq .",
    "( [ frenkel ] ) .",
    "in this case , eq .  ( [ frenkel ] ) can be written in the form @xmath19    - \\frac{x^3}{4}\\int_\\alpha^{\\infty }    \\frac{dy}{y^3 } \\log\\left(\\frac{x+y}{x - y}\\right)^2 f(y)\\ ] ] in the infrared limit @xmath20 . solving this equation",
    "numerically gives the same results as that found in @xcite for the analytic solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : frenkel ] ) .",
    "these results appear in fig .",
    "[ afig ] .        the integral equation ( [ eq : a ] ) , and the equations that will be considered below , are subtle to solve , especially in the limit of large @xmath21 ( small momentum ) , which is the region we are mainly interested in .",
    "the source of the difficulty is as follows . in the limit @xmath22 eq .  ( [ eq : a ] ) has the form @xmath23 this equation has a contribution from @xmath24 which is canceled by a term coming from the integral .",
    "this cancellation is difficult to see numerically , but it can be avoided by performing the substitution , @xmath25 with constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 to be fixed shortly . using this substitution , we find that @xmath28 satisfies an equation of the form @xmath29 we fix @xmath26 by requiring @xmath30 approach a constant as @xmath22 , and we fix @xmath27 by requiring the solution @xmath28 approach 0 as @xmath22 .      in this section and the next we use an eikonal approximation for the 3point function @xcite :",
    "@xmath31 using this expression effectively resums a series of higher loop vertex graphs which are important in the infrared region .",
    "first , we consider the integral equation obtained from eq .",
    "( [ sd ] ) with the vertex given by eq.([eikenol ] ) and bare propagators : @xmath32 using the notation of eq .",

    "a finite result in the infrared limit is obtained .",
    "the fluctuations that occur at small @xmath21 are not physical since small @xmath21 corresponds to the ultraviolet limit , and the eikonal approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eikenol ] ) is only valid in the infrared limit .",
    "the final approximation we consider is a variation of the previous one .",

    "( [ eq : d ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) , which was obtained using approximation c , is as follows .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) makes use of an analytic cancellation between certain sets of graphs corresponding to vertex corrections , which are contained in eq .",
    "( [ eikenol ] ) , and graphs that are contained in the expression for the full propagator @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "these analytic cancellations are performed , before the expansion of the full propagator is done .",
    "the results appear in fig .",
    "once again we obtain a self  energy that is finite in the infrared limit .",
    "we have considered various approximations to the schwinger  dyson equation that can be used to calculate the pressure in @xmath0 theory in 6 dimensions .",
    "the approximations used sum up different classes of diagrams believed to be important in the infrared limit . in all cases considered a finite result is obtained for the pressure in the infrared limit , although the quantitative behaviour differs according to which approximation is used , as is expected .",
    "the important conclusion to be drawn from these results is that the finiteness of the pressure in the infrared limit is not very sensitive to the particular approximation used , and thus seems to be a general feature of pressure calculations based on a schwinger ",
