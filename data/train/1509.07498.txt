    "observations have shown that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous at large scales . at the same time , the universe is highly anisotropic at smaller scales and builds up a hierarchical structure of matter from galaxies to super clusters .",
    "while these dense structures are forming , it is unavoidable to create underdense regions which are called voids . like the overdense regions , the voids are also highly affected by the evolution of the universe s energy density components and",
    "therefore could be a powerful cosmological probe@xcite .",
    "for example , their shapes and sizes are sensitive to the nature of the dark energy @xcite and their internal dynamics may represent the fifth force in the modified gravity theory@xcite .    unlike luminous overdense regions ,",
    "the voids can not be found directly , partly because they are generally faint ( because of the lack of galaxies ) or even completely dark .",
    "thus , they are identified through mapping of the overdense areas first and then by using void finders@xcite to pick up the voids . at large scales ,",
    "the voids shapes are statically isotropic and therefore stacking could make the voids look like standard spheres .",
    "this is the basic requirement to precede the alcock - paczynski test@xcite , and several such tests have been done @xcite either through the millenium run simulation @xcite or actual observations .",
    "since voids shapes have been affected by the evolution of the cosmological components , their orientation will also be affected by the evolution .",
    "thus , we could also use orientation of the voids to test a gravitational model in question .",
    "simulations have shown that the orientations of voids are highly correlated with their close neighbors ( within @xmath0)@xcite .",
    "this , however , has not been confirmed in any actual observation . in this article",
    "we are not trying to test this short distance alignment , instead we are focusing on the large scale orientation .",
    "at such scales alcock - paczynski effect and galaxies peculiar velocities are the main source of distortion .",
    "our study confirms that empirical stretching factor ( which is caused by peculiar velocities ) also plays an important role in the orientation of the voids and their density profiles . as a consequence , by studying the void density profile",
    ", we could study the cosmological energy density components . in the following section we first describe our dataset from the public cosmic void catalogue @xcite and",
    "then show the distribution of the orientation of the void .",
    "the alcock - paczynski effect strongly affects the statistics of the long axis and could be a good probe to test the cosmical parameters .",
    "the orientation test is similar to the one by sutter et al .",
    "@xcite , though the method is different",
    ". however , this is not enough to quantify the peculiar velocity effect .",
    "therefore , we fit the void density with an empirical universal density .",
    "this in turn could quantify the peculiar velocity effect .",
    "from the @xmath1 and likelihood analysis change with @xmath2 , we find that the density profile can serve as the cosmological probe , though the current void number might not be fully sufficient yet for very precise results and a prior function must be known to study the confidence level .",
    "recently , several void catalogues were completed and released@xcite . in this study , we use the voids in the public cosmic void catalogue@xcite , because this catalogue includes the most recently results .",
    "this catalogue puts the voids and void galaxies in the following coordinates    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is redshift .",
    "@xmath5 is the comoving distance from the center .",
    "ra is right ascension and dec is declination in the equatorial coordinate system .",
    "since the data set is within @xmath6 , the radial component can be ignored , and @xmath5 is written as    @xmath7    here , we assume the universe is flat .",
    "@xmath2 is the dark energy component and @xmath8 is the matter component . @xmath9 .",
    "the catalogue includes two sub - catalogues ( comoving and redshift ) according to the coordinate in which it is searched for the voids .",

    "the void alignment depends on three sources : initial conditions , void packing and tidal forces@xcite .",
    "these three sources should be local effects and should not contribute much at large scales . therefore the distribution of the orientation of the cosmological voids should be a random distribution . based on this , it was suggested that the void orientation with respect to the line of sight could be a measure of the redshift distortion@xcite .",
    "if void orientation is random , the angle , @xmath12 , between its orientation direction and line - of - sight satisfies the distribution    @xmath13    or @xmath14    to examine this assumption , we calculate the orientation of voids through ellipsoid approximation .",
    "we compute the location of the void s center through the volume weight as    @xmath15    here , @xmath16 is the position of the void s i - th galaxy s and @xmath17 is its voronoi cell s volume .",

    "it is known that alcock - paczynski effect could cause redshift distortion . at the same time it also distorts the orientation of a void . for our purpose , to study the alcock - paczynski effect on the orientation , we ca nt approximate the void shape with a sphere , because of the voids irregular shapes and their tracers peculiar velocities . to simplify the argument",
    ", we consider the void to be a one dimensional rod .",
    "the rods directions are the orientation of long axes .",
    "the real situation is more complicated , but our approximation can at least tell us what is going on when considering the alcock - paczyski effect on the void s orientation .",

    "the result is consistent with the @xmath1 test and it implies that the empirical density profile form we obtained is reasonable .",
    "however , this is not enough to apply the result to calculate the confidence level directly , since the prior functions must be known .",
    "unfortunately , in this case assuming a constant prior function is not suitable .",
    "it is unclear if this is caused by the limitation if the voids number or by the voids density profiles .",
