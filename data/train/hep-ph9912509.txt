    "<S> we analyse the @xmath0 asymmetry for @xmath1 in the two higgs doublet model with tree level flavor changing currents ( model iii ) and three higgs doublet model with @xmath2 symmetry in the higgs sector , including @xmath3 type long distance effects . </S>",
    "<S> further , we study the dependencies of the branching ratio @xmath4 and the ratio of @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd amplitude squares , @xmath5 , on the @xmath0 parameter @xmath6 . we found that , there is a weak @xmath0 asymmetry , at the order of @xmath7 . besides , the branching ratio @xmath4 , and also @xmath8 ratio , is not sensitive to the @xmath0 parameter for @xmath9 . </S>"
