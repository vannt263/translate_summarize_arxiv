    "the flows in these atmospheres are expected to approach or exceed the local sound speed ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "a lingering question in the astrophysical literature is whether these supersonic flows can develop into shocks and subsequently dissipate some of the kinetic energy of the flow as heat .",
    "specifically , the question reduces to whether continuous flow in a closed loop may become supersonic and if some portions of the supersonic flow steepen into shocks .    in the present letter , we provide the answers to these questions by re - visiting a problem that is mathematically and physically similar : the design of wind tunnels and the de laval nozzle . in  [ sect : delaval ] , we demonstrate the possibility of supersonic flow in a closed - loop flow and state a simple criterion for determining if these flows develop shocks . in  [ sect : hj ] , we apply our method to simulations of hot jovian atmospheres .",
    "the implications of our study are discussed in ",
    "[ sect : discussion ] .",
    "while much of this section is based on the monograph of @xcite , the re - derivation of these results elucidates the key concepts and assumptions made in stating our method , which we will later apply to hot jovian atmospheres .      in its most basic form , the de laval nozzle consists essentially of a tube that continuously narrows to a minimum in its cross section , known as the  throat \" , before widening again in a symmetric fashion .",
    "the conservation of mass dictates that the mass flux @xmath3 is constant , such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cross - sectional area of the nozzle , @xmath6 is the flow speed normal to the cross section and @xmath7 is the mass density of the fluid . invoking the conservation of momentum ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the pressure ) and the definition for the sound speed ( @xmath10 ) , we obtain @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the mach number of the flow . when the flow is strictly subsonic ( @xmath13 ) , it becomes virtually incompressible ( @xmath14 ) . substituting this expression into the equation for the conservation of mass yields",
    "@xmath15    when the flow is subsonic ( @xmath16 ) , narrowing the nozzle ( @xmath17 ) leads to an increase in the flow speed ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the flow is symmetric with respect to the throat .",
    "however , if the flow is supersonic ( @xmath19 ) , narrowing the nozzle leads to the somewhat counter - intuitive result that a _ decrease _ in the flow speed ( @xmath20 ) occurs .",
    "the flow is now _ asymmetric _ across the throat because of compressibility effects . in the design of continuous wind tunnels",
    "there is often a region of narrowed cross section , downstream of the de laval nozzle , known as a  diffuser \" , which decelerates the flow and discharges it back into the return circuit . when @xmath21 , we get @xmath22 only when @xmath23 .    , where @xmath5 is the cross - sectional area and @xmath24 is the cross - sectional area corresponding to the sound speed .",

    "there are generally two solution branches : subsonic and supersonic .",
    "if a given nozzle has a throat with a cross - sectional area larger than @xmath24 , then the solution remains in the subsonic branch and is symmetric about the throat .",
    "if the throat has a cross - sectional area @xmath24 , then the system develops an asymmetry , where the flow from the entry point to the throat is subsonic , while the flow from the throat to the exit point is supersonic .",
    "the pressure drops monotonically from a value of @xmath28 to @xmath43 .",

    "while our present study of the de laval nozzle can not be directly applied to exoplanetary atmospheres and thus does not yield any quantitative predictions , we do gain some heuristic insight :    * we expect supersonic flow to be able to develop in continuous flows inherent in exoplanetary atmospheres ( without orography ) , consistent with the results of published 3d simulations ( see  [ subject : previous ] for references ) ; * in the de laval nozzle , variations in the pressure , density and mach number are induced by changes in the cross - sectional area . in irradiated atmospheres , changes in the mach number are induced by changes in temperature ; * for close - in exoplanets that are expected to be tidally locked , the hemispheric ( dayside - only ) nature of the stellar irradiation _ naturally _ introduces re - compression into the continuous flow from dayside to nightside .",
    "irradiated , tidally - locked exoplanets create their own pressure  barrier \" for the atmospheric flow to crash into , thus creating shocks .",
    "we expect this pressure barrier to exist near the substellar point .",
    "the question of whether a shock develops in a continuous flow can be reduced to analyzing how the mach number of the flow changes along a given streamline . since mass , momentum and energy",
    "are conserved , the problem is mathematically identical to employing the established machinery of the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions .    consider a flow in 2d , cartesian coordinates .",
    "let the flow be described by the velocity components @xmath46 and @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 . across an interface , the mach number changes .",

    "the ratio of the downstream to the upstream mass density is @xmath54 a relationship between @xmath49 and @xmath52 may be obtained by taking the ratio of @xmath55 to @xmath56 and invoking the jump condition for @xmath57 , @xmath58 for @xmath59 , two corresponding values of @xmath49 exist .",
    "the first is @xmath60 , which describes a situation where the downstream flow is subsonic ( e.g. , for a strong shock ) .",
    "the second occurs when @xmath61 which describes a situation where the downstream flow is supersonic .",
    "supersonic flow is a necessary but insufficient condition for a shock to develop .",
    "a wave with a constant propagation speed possesses the property that every point on the wave is translated by the same distance after a given time interval . in the parameter space of distance versus time , a given point on the wave at different times is connected by a straight line known as a characteristic .",
    "it is apparent that these characteristics never intersect .",
    "in reality , the propagation speed also depends on the density of the fluid , implying that different points on the wave are translated by different distances over a given time interval . in this case",
    ", the characteristics may intersect  if they do , a shock forms and converts part of the kinetic energy into heat .    at the equator of an irradiated , tidally - locked exoplanet ,",
    "the flow is predominantly zonal ( east - west ) .",
    "for purely zonal flow , each characteristic is associated with its own value of the angle @xmath62 ( sometimes known as the  mach angle \" ) .",
    "when @xmath62 decreases , the characteristics diverge .",
    "when @xmath62 increases , they converge .",
    "convergence is not necessary an indication of intersection  there needs to be enough _ room _ for the characteristics to intersect . on a sphere ( with a radius @xmath63 ) where two points are separated by a small angular distance @xmath64 , the horizontal distance @xmath65 over which intersection occurs",
    "is given by @xmath66 where the subscript  2 \" refers to a point downstream of another point subscripted by  1 \" .",

    "we first apply the method described in the previous section to the 2d , linear , analytical , 1.5-layer , shallow water model of @xcite , which reproduces some of the flow features of hot jovian photospheres .",
    "there are several important limitations associated with the shallow water model .",
    "the governing equation for the shallow water height derives from the condition of incompressibility .",
    "there is no governing equation for temperature .",
    "both features imply that a sound speed can not formally be defined . however , a proxy for the sound speed is the gravity wave speed , which is defined in shallow water systems as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the surface gravity and @xmath72 is the equilibrium water height . when the flow velocity exceeds @xmath73 , the analogues of shocks known as hydraulic jumps develop .",
    "the flow velocity normalized by @xmath73 is then a proxy for the mach number .",
    "stellar irradiation and radiative transfer are not explicitly considered in the shallow water model .",
    "rather , the effects of radiation are mimicked using a dimensionless radiative drag time scale @xmath67 .",
    "a dimensionless time scale @xmath68 mimics the effect of hydrodynamic drag .",
    "figure [ fig : sp11 ] shows calculations corresponding to the 9 models presented in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "we have shown the characteristic angle @xmath74 only at the equator , since this simplifies our analysis .",
    "negative values of @xmath62 correspond to counter - rotating ( rather than super - rotating ) flow .",
    "first , we see that there are locations where the magnitude of @xmath62 increases and thus hydraulic jump formation may occur .",
    "second , the existence of these locations is robust to the strength of irradiation ( through @xmath67 ) and the presence of drag ( through @xmath68 ) .",

    "locations exist where @xmath80 implying that the intersection of characteristics , associated with points in the flow where @xmath62 is increasing , will occur .",
    "we reach the same conclusion when we examine atmospheric layers at higher altitudes ( lower pressures ) . at pressures of @xmath81 bar ,",

    "[ fig : model_w ] , we examine model w of @xcite , which has @xmath82 k. our conclusions drawn from examining model h carry over : shocks form mostly on the dayside hemisphere , where @xmath62 is an increasing function of longitude .",

    "the atmospheres of tidally - locked , irradiated exoplanets are akin to _ forced _ wind tunnels .",
    "previously published work on simulations of irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres have recorded supersonic flows when the temperature reaches @xmath0 k. most of these studies utilize  general circulation models \" ( gcms ) , which are traditionally designed to model the terrestrial climate system and do not include an explicit treatment of shocks @xcite .",
    "these simulations may describe supersonic flow , but do not correctly convert a fraction of the kinetic energy into heat .",
    "exceptions are the work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which include proper shock capturing .",
    "the simulations of @xcite are 2d and require confirmation by 3d simulations due to the global nature of flow features in the atmospheres of close - in , irradiated exoplanets . although their simulations are 3d in nature , @xcite and @xcite employed a non - global grid in an attempt to circumvent the  pole problem \" @xcite , where the convergence of meridians at the poles results in vanishing time steps for the simulations . @xcite employed a partial solution to the pole problem that violates causality .",
    "detailed comparisons between the work of @xcite and the insight gained from the present study require future 3d simulations that solve the pole problem and include shock heating in a self - consistent , energy - conserving manner .",
    "@xcite examined the effects of varying stellar irradiation on the atmospheric circulation . at locations where the mach number exceeds unity",
    ", they assumed a shock to form and dissipate a fraction @xmath86 of the kinetic energy into heat . in light of our present results",
