    "rapid progress in spin based information processing and storage devicing technologies has been metamorphosed into an emerging field called ` spintronics '  @xcite , revolutionizing nanotechnology with the plethora of concepts which are particularly aimed at the exquisite control and manipulation of spin degree of freedom in semiconductor structures i.e. , using the spin as a career of classical or quantum information . despite being a few decades old topic semiconductor spintronics has reignited interest to investigate the role of so interaction in generating pure spin current which is the central theme of this newborn branch of condensed matter physics . originating from the relativistic correction to the schrdinger equation ,",
    "so interaction provides an all electrical way to generate and manipulate spin current in a far precise way rather than the usual magnetic field based spin control .",
    "longitudinal flow of unpolarized charge current through a sample with so coupling can induce non - equilibrium spin accumulation at the lateral edges of the sample in transverse direction , and therefore , a pure spin current is established if connected through ideal leads in transverse direction .",
    "this is the basic phenomenon of spin hall effect .",
    "the main source of so coupling in mesoscopic systems comes from either magnetic impurities ( extrinsic type ) or from structural or bulk inversion asymmetry in the confining potential of the system ( intrinsic type ) yielding rashba or dresselhaus type so interaction  @xcite .",
    "few years back some theoretical proposals were made on the existence of intrinsic she in hole doped  @xcite or electron doped  @xcite semi - conducting systems where so interaction strength is strong enough to split the bloch energy bands for up and down spin electrons . in this case a pure spin current is predicted to flow along @xmath4 direction , in response to the longitudinal electric field along @xmath5 direction through the infinite homogeneous system , essentially capturing the essence of a semi - classical effect .",
    "et al . _ predicted an universal value of spin hall conductivity ( equal to @xmath0 ) for two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the clean limit being independent of the so coupling    strength and electron density .",
    "the intrinsic she is much different from the extrinsic effect proposed by hirsch  @xcite , where up and down spin electrons get deflected in opposite directions due to spin dependent scattering off impurities .",
    "however , the magnitude of spin hall current in the intrinsic case is expected to be several orders of magnitude larger than the extrinsic one .",
    "these theoretical anticipations have also been verified experimentally .",
    "she in @xmath6-dimensional ( @xmath6d ) hole  @xcite or electron  @xcite gases have attracted a tremendous attention in research community .",
    "furthermore , in some recent experiments  @xcite the existence of spin accumulation on the lateral edge of a two - terminal @xmath6d hole gas or a @xmath7d n - type semiconducting system has also been detected .",
    "later on various theoretical investigations have been done to illustrate she in mesoscopic 2deg and ring geometries focusing on different aspects of this intriguing phenomena . in 2004",
    "_ studied she by measuring dc voltage drop in response to a longitudinal dc current  @xcite . in 2005 , sheng _",
    "et al . _ further investigated she in a finite size square lattice  @xcite to explore the non - quantized nature of spin hall conductances which also depends on various physical parameters such as so coupling strength , electronic fermi energy , and disorder strength , etc .",
    "in the same year , nikolic and co - workers observed  @xcite quasi - periodic oscillations in spin hall conductances due to spin sensitive quantum interference effect in a finite width mesoscopic ring . in another work , again they studied she in 2deg in detail  @xcite both for ordered and disordered cases .",
    "after that , in 2007 , nicolik _ et al .",
    "_ made a comparative study between extrinsic and intrinsic she s in disordered mesoscopic multi - terminal systems , again considering a square lattice topology  @xcite .",
    "till date a wealth of literature has been formed studying she .",
    "but the focus of most of those works were on p- or n - doped semiconductors .",
    "even the numerical calculations for finite size systems were based on either square lattice  @xcite or ring  @xcite geometries .",
    "later , discovery of a new class of spin hall insulators  @xcite by murakami _",
    "_ establishes the fact that apart from the so interaction strength the lattice structure itself plays a very significant role in determining spin hall conductances through its band structure . in 2009 , liu _",
    "_ observed more exotic she in kagome  @xcite and honeycomb  @xcite lattices because of their fascinating topology .",
    "but their analysis were based on kubo formalism  @xcite , which requires an infinite homogeneous system in clean limit .",
    "hence a deeper insight into the experimental detection of such effect in this kind of geometry demands a quantitative prediction of spin hall conductances in finite size systems .",
    "this is the main motivation behind our work .",
    "this kind of geometry is interesting not only from the theoretical point of view , but it has also profound experimental significance  @xcite .",
    "this type of lattice can be easily fabricated by modern patterning technique  @xcite , or observed in reconstructed semiconductor surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a transverse magnetic field has a deeper impact on electronic properties in a kagome lattice which has also been reflected in our she study . in 1994 ,",
    "nori _ et al .",
    "_ have studied quantum interference effect due to electronic motion on kagome lattice in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "later , in 2002 , they have investigated both analytically and numerically the mean field superconducting - normal phase boundaries in several @xmath6d networks considering a transverse magnetic field .",
    "they have determined the transition temperature as a function of magnetic flux @xmath8 passing through the smallest triangular plaquettes using the lattice path integral technique  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we explore different aspects of she in a kagome lattice geometry with rashba type so interaction in clean limit using landauer - bttiker formalism . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no such finite size spin hall conductance calculation has been done for a kagome lattice geometry so far .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after presenting a brief introduction and motivation in section i , in section",
    "ii , we describe the model and theoretical formulation to obtain the shc and longitudinal conductance .",
    "the numerical results are illustrated in section iii .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our results .",
    "we start describing our model which corroborates with the experimental set - up for observing the she , where a four - probe mesoscopic bridge is used for detection of pure spin current .",
    "four ideal leads are attached to the central region ( see fig .  [ spinhall1 ] ) which is a finite size kagome lattice with rashba type so interaction .",
    "an unpolarized charge current is allowed to pass through the longitudinal leads ( lead-@xmath9 and lead-@xmath10 ) inducing spin hall current in the transverse direction ( lead-@xmath6 and lead-@xmath7 ) .",
    "a discrete lattice model is used to describe the finite size kagome lattice and also the side attached leads within the framework of tight - binding approximation assuming only nearest - neighbor coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian representing the entire system can be written as a sum of three terms , @xmath11 the first term represents the hamiltonian for the finite size kagome lattice and it reads as , @xmath12_z \\mbox{\\boldmath $ c$}_{j } \\label{eqn2}\\ ] ] where , + @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 + @xmath16 +   + here , @xmath17 is the on - site potential energy and for a perfectly ordered system it is set equal to @xmath18 for all the atomic sites . @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , of an electron with spin @xmath21 at the @xmath22-th site of the conductor .",
    "@xmath23 represents the isotropic hopping strength between nearest - neighbor sites in presence of magnetic field .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is incorporated in the hopping term @xmath23 through the peierl s phase factor and it can be written as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hopping strength in absence of magnetic field .",
    "@xmath28 is the elementary flux quantum .",
    "the specific choice of the vector potential @xmath29 in this case and the exact calculation of the peierl s phase factor are discussed in the subsequent sub - section .",
    "the third term corresponds to the rashba type so coupling in the system through spin dependent nearest - neighbor hopping term which introduces spin flipping in the system .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 estimates the strength of the rashba so interaction originated due to structural inversion asymmetry of the confining potential and different band offsets at the heterostructure quantum well interface . in this term",
    ", @xmath31 is the spin angular momentum of the electron and @xmath32 is the unit vector along the direction from @xmath22-th site to @xmath33-th site .",
    "the four metallic leads attached to the conductor are considered to be semi - infinite and ideal , i.e. , without any disorder and so interaction .",
    "the leads are described by a similar non - interacting single particle hamiltonian as written below .",
    "@xmath34 where , @xmath35 similarly , the conductor - to - lead coupling is described by the following hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath36 here , @xmath37 \\label{eqn6}\\ ] ] in the above expression , @xmath38 and @xmath39 stand for the site energy and nearest - neighbor hopping between the sites of the leads .",
    "the coupling between the leads and the conductor is defined by the hopping integral @xmath40 . in eq .",
    "[ eqn6 ] , @xmath22 and @xmath41 belong to the boundary sites of the kagome ribbon and leads , respectively .",
    "the summation over @xmath42 is due to incorporation of the four side - attached leads .",
    "now we proceed to evaluate the peierl s phase factor in the term @xmath23 .",
    "we choose the vector potential @xmath29 in the form , @xmath43 this specific choice is followed from a literature  @xcite , and the purpose of doing that is solely the simplification of the factor @xmath44 along a particular direction ( @xmath45 axis in this case ) .    with this particular choice of @xmath29",
    "we determine @xmath23 for three different types of hopping paths in the kagome lattice as follows .",
    "0.25 cm @xmath46 our choice of gauge ensures that the component of @xmath29 along @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ kagome1 ] ) axis is zero .",

    "0.25 cm @xmath50 if we consider the motion along @xmath5 axis , in general for the @xmath51-th line ( fig .  [ kagome1 ] )",
    "we can write the hopping integral as , @xmath52 where , @xmath8 is the flux through a smallest triangle of the lattice , and @xmath53 .",
    "0.25 cm @xmath54 finally , we consider the hopping along @xmath55-th site to @xmath22-th site and all its parallel directions ( see fig .",
    "[ kagome2 ] ) .",
    "it can be shown by straightforward algebra that for an upward pointing triangle ( @xmath56 ) the modified hopping strengths are given by , @xmath57 the value of @xmath51 belongs to the base line of the triangle .",
    "+ similarly , for a downward pointing triangle    ( @xmath58 ) the modified hopping integrals can be written as , @xmath59 here , @xmath60 , as for a downward pointing triangle the sites @xmath61 and @xmath62 does not belong to the same value of @xmath51 .    following the above prescription we incorporate the effect of magnetic field quite easily in our lattice geometry .",
    "but there are other ways through which we can introduce the effect of magnetic field in lattice models .",
    "for example , nori _ et al .",
    "_ have used a different approach of lattice path integral technique  @xcite to describe the effect of magnetic field in different lattice structures .",
    "particularly , this technique allows us to evaluate the physical quantities in terms of explicit functions for a continuously tunable flux .      according to spin hall phenomenology , in our model pure spin current",
    "is predicted to flow through the transverse leads , due to the flow of charge current through the longitudinal leads .",
    "hence , the linear response longitudinal ( 4-probe ) and spin hall conductances are defined as @xmath65 and @xmath66 where , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the charge current and spin current flowing through the lead-4 and lead-2 , respectively .",
    "@xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the potential at the @xmath41-th lead .    now , following landauer - bttiker multi - probe formalism the charge and spin currents flowing through the lead @xmath41 with potential @xmath72 , can be written in terms of spin resolved transmission probabilities as  @xcite , @xmath73 @xmath74 \\label{eqn14}\\ ] ] considering linear transport regime , at absolute zero temperature the linear conductance @xmath75 is obtained using landauer conductance formula  @xcite , @xmath76 using landauer conductance formula spin current through @xmath41-th lead can be re - written in terms of spin resolved conductances as , @xmath77 \\label{eqn16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation  [ eqn16 ] can be simplified in terms of two quantities defined as follows . @xmath78",
    "physically the term @xmath79 is the total spin current flowing from the @xmath41-th lead with voltage @xmath72 to all other @xmath51 leads , while the term @xmath80 defines the total spin current flowing into the @xmath41-th lead from the all other @xmath51 leads having potential @xmath81 .",

    "as the currents in the various leads depend only on voltage differences among them , we can set one of the voltages to zero without any loss of generality . here , we set @xmath84 .",

    "now , in absence of external magnetic flux only the rashba so interaction does not break the time reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "in general , for a time reversal invariant system @xmath88 , which is equivalent to write @xmath89 . therefore ,",
    "obeying trs the expression for the spin hall conductance can be written in terms of spin resolved transmission probabilities in a compact form as , @xmath90 \\label{eqn21}\\ ] ] one important point to be noted here is that unlike the charge current spin current is a vector quantity , which immediately gives rise to the three different components of spin hall conductances ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) and they are defined as follows .",
    "@xmath94 using eq .  [ eqn21 ] all the three different components of shc can be evaluated , only the choice of basis while constructing the matrices is important .",
    "for example , if we are working in @xmath95 diagonal representation ( i.e. , the @xmath96 axis chosen to be the spin quantization axis ) , then eq .  [ eqn21 ]",
    "gives the @xmath97-component of shc .",

    "k*-valley ' hamiltonian ) exhibits a dirac type spectrum with linear dependence of energy on momentum , and accordingly , the value of conventional spin hall conductivity gets the value @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore the anti - symmetry at the band center is completely due to the particle - hole symmetry of the employed tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the variation in sign and magnitude of spin hall conductivity in the range ( @xmath145 ) is associated with the change in fermi surface topology surrounding the high symmetry and * k * brillouin zone ( bz ) points .",

    "it is a consequence of the fact that the spin current is defined as the difference between spin resolved charge currents ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) , and the spin current carried by negatively charged electrons at @xmath150 can be interpreted as the propagation of positively charged holes with opposite spin in opposite direction .",

    "it exhibits quite a similar behavior to our previous investigation  @xcite of two - terminal longitudinal conductance .",
    "the addition of the two other semi - infinite transverse finite width leads allows some extra phase - breaking paths and thereby lifting the transmission zeros and hence broadening the conductance peaks .",
    "the conductance spectrum reveals itself the energy eigenstates of the finite size system .",
    "the presence of rashba coupling does not affect the energy spectrum in a significant way apart from shifting of the energy eigenvalues a little .",
    "the dependence of spin hall conductance of a finite size kagome lattice on the rashba coupling strength at the typical energy @xmath154 is illustrated in fig .",

    "although the physically accessible range of @xmath30 ( in unit of @xmath27 ) is @xmath158 to @xmath9 , but here we plot the spectrum for a wider range , a part of which may be beyond the experimental reach till date .",
    "for a sufficiently large so coupling , @xmath93 again drops to @xmath18 , because large so coupling in the conductor forms a large potential barrier for the incident electrons , yielding a very small probability to transmit through the conductor .",
    "figure  [ energyflux ] depicts the energy - flux characteristics of a finite size ( @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) kagome lattice both in the presence and absence of rashba type so coupling .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian and the energy - flux spectrum is often called the hofstader spectrum .",
    "form fig .",
    "[ energyflux](a ) it is clearly visible that a highly degenerate level exists at @xmath161 when @xmath8 is set equal to @xmath18 , and the application of a very small non - zero flux starts to break the degeneracy .",
    "the presence of even a very small magnetic flux affects the phase of the electronic wave function and thus tends to destroy the quantum interference and eventually breaks the flat band  @xcite .",

    "for any arbitrary flux , translational invariance is lost along all directions and the hopping integrals become different . as a result the sharp features like the sign reversal about the symmetry points of the fermi surface get reduced because of the elastic scattering , which is    visible in fig .",
    "[ hallmag](b ) . very interestingly , again at @xmath162,it can be shown from the above equations that the translational invariance is again restored along both the @xmath5 and @xmath45 directions which can be deducted from the above equations , and therefore , scattering effect gets completely suppressed and shc re - appears but with inverse manner due to the change in band structure .",
    "it can also be observed that for @xmath174 ( @xmath51 and @xmath41 being integers ) , translational invariance is retained ( increasing the unit cell dimension ) and hence system size has an important role as we are dealing with a finite size kagome lattice . in this case",

    "[ hallmag1 ] ) .",
    "the application of an external magnetic flux breaks the time reversal symmetry ( trs ) , but still she is still observed though reduced due to the elastic scattering .",
    "the reason is that in the presence of an external magnetic field along the @xmath96 direction , an ordinary hall voltage appears along the transverse edges of the sample and since the transverse leads are voltage probes no charge current will flow through them .",
    "therefore the tendency of accumulation of charges of both spins somehow tries to reduce the features of she , which is entirely an effect due to the spin accumulation along the transverse edges and the flow of spin current in that direction , if leads are connected .",

    "in conclusion , in the present paper we have studied different aspects of mesoscopic spin hall effect induced by rashba type so interaction in a kagome lattice geometry attached to four finite width probes both in the presence and absence of external magnetic flux .",
    "we have evaluated spin hall conductance ( shc ) and longitudinal conductance for a finite size system in the clean limit using four - terminal landauer - bttiker formalism and green s function technique . in the absence of magnetic flux , we have observed that due to the change in fermi surface topology shc changes its sign at certain values of fermi energy , along with the band center . unlike the infinite system ( where shc is a universal constant @xmath179 )",

    "it is also important to note that in our theoretical model we have included the effect of magnetic field through the phase factor in the hopping term and ignored the zeeman term in the hamiltonian since in this geometry , the zeeman coupling strength ( @xmath181mev ) is much smaller than the hopping integral ( @xmath182mev ) which has been discussed in the earlier work  @xcite ."
