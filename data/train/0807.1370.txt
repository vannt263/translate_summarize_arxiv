    "generically the interaction between a quantum system and its environment results in decoherence , and may lead the system to experience the so - called quantum - classical transition @xcite .",
    "for this reason the decoherence process is regarded as the main obstacle for the implementation of quantum information processing @xcite . generally speaking the properties of the environment",
    "may strongly affect its decohering capabilities @xcite .",
    "this implies that a quantum system can be regarded as a probe to extract useful information about the coupled environment , e.g. , the quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) .",
    "very recently a nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiment of this kind has been performed @xcite .",
    "there a single qubit was used as a probe to detect the ( precursors of the ) quantum critical point of the coupled environment .",
    "the relationship between the decoherence of a central spin and the qpts of the coupled environment can be established through the notion of loschmidt echo ( le ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known that le can be exploited to measure the stability of a quantum system to perturbations @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a central spin coupled with an ising spin chain in a transverse field was considered ; the authors found that the decay of le is enhanced by quantum criticality .",
    "the connection between le and quantum criticality has been further clarified in ref .",
    "there the authors showed that the le enhancement holds true just for short decay times ( gaussian regime ) .",
    "a genuine signature of criticality , on the other hand , can be recovered by studying the asymptotic ( large time ) behaviour of le as function of the environment coupling parameter @xcite .",
    "more recently , the averaged le over all states on hilbert space with a haar measure , called operator fidelity , was proposed to study quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "this proposal is a direct extension to the operator level of state - space quantum fidelity .",
    "this latter notion recently attracted a lot of attention as a new tool to analyze quantum criticality , both a zero - temperature and at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "whereas in @xcite the initial state of the spin chain was assumed to be the ground state , in this paper we aim at considering a more general situation : the initial state of the environment is a mixture of the eigenstate of its hamiltonian . the gibbs thermal state is special instance of this setup . with this assumption",
    "the study of decoherence naturally leads to a state - dependent generalizations of the operator fidelity suggested in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss the operator extensions of fidelity on general grounds . in order to do",
    "that one has simply to notice that finite - time quantum evolutions correspond to unitary operators that themselves belong to an hilbert space i.e. , the hilbert - schmidt one .",
    "it follows that some of the results obtained in the fidelity approach for quantum states lifts immediately to the operator level we are now interested in . we will show that the corresponding operator fidelity susceptibility ( ofs ) contains two different contributions .",
    "these two terms arise from variation upon parameter change of energy levels and eigenstates respectively and have very different temporal behaviour .",
    "we will then get a general expression for ofs for models with a factorization structure typical of quasi - free models .",
    "finally , we will exploit ofs for studying an environment described by an ising chain with a transverse field that can be driven to quantum criticality .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we give a general description of the models and the relations between decoherence of the central system and the operator fidelity of two time evolutions of the environment . in sec .",
    "[ sec : unitary ] , we give generalities about operator metric and fidelities and analyze the general ofs . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fact ] , we consider the models with a factorization structure , and give a general expression for the ofs , and then study the ising model with a transverse field , get the exact solution for the ofs .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] contains the conclusions and outlook .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , an important physical motivation for the operator fidelities we are going to analyze in this paper is provided by the decoherence process . to see this clearly ,",
    "let us consider a purely dephasing coupling of a system with its environment .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian has the form @xmath0 the entire hamiltonian is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 consists of system hamiltonian @xmath3 and bath hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 eigenstates @xmath6 , play here the role of preferred pointer states @xcite .    with the initial state @xmath7 , the reduced density matrix of the system at time @xmath8 can be written as @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 $ ] obviously , in the generic case @xmath12 evolves from initial pure states to mixed states .",
    "the decay of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath12 means a reduction from a pure state to a classical mixture of the preferred pointer states  quantum - classical transitions .",
    "the temporal behavior of the off - diagonal element is decided by two factors , one is @xmath13 , just relating to initial state , and the other @xmath14 $ ] is unrelated with the initial state of the system , reflecting the dephasing effect induced by environment .",
    "the latter can be considered as a fidelity for two operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 . which is defined by @xmath17 where the inner product @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this fidelity can be obtained from the density matrix of the central system and encodes information about the bath state .",
    "notice that one might choose @xmath19 in this case different @xmath16 simply correspond to different values of the coupling strength @xmath20 in front of the `` perturbation '' @xmath21 this is the scenario we mostly have in mind in this paper ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ising ] ) .",
    "let us now specialize to a 2-level system coupled with a bath . if interaction is weak enough , the two effective hamiltonians are slightly different .",
    "for an instance in sec .",

    "will become the loschmidt echo for @xmath26 ( for non degenerate ground state ) and it coincides with the operator fidelity defined in @xcite for @xmath27",
    "in this section we discuss operator fidelity from a rather general mathematical point view .",

    "this simple remark shows that operator fidelity ( [ op_fid ] ) quantifies the degree of statistical distinguishability between the two states @xmath57 when @xmath43 and @xmath58 denote unitary transformations the quantity ( [ op_fid ] ) has an interpretation as visibility strength in properly designed interferometric experiments @xcite .",
    "yet another kind of operational relevance of the operator fidelities [ op_fid ] in the context of decoherence will be discussed in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "now , following the differential - geometric spirit of @xcite , we are going to consider the operator fidelity ( [ op_fid ] ) between infinitesimally different unitaries .",
    "the leading term in the expansion of ( [ op_fid ] ) will define a quadratic form over the tangent space of the manifold @xmath59 for full rank @xmath45 that quadratic form is a _ metric_. the following proposition shows that and its proof it is just a direct calculation analogous to the one performed at the state - space level @xcite .",

    "<S> the extension of the notion of quantum fidelity from the state - space level to the operator one can be used to study environment - induced decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> state - dependent operator fidelity suceptibility ( ofs ) , the leading order term for slightly different operator parameters , is shown to have a nontrivial behavior when the environment is at critical points . </S>",
