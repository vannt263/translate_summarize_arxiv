    "worldline methods in quantum field theory have seen a revival in recent years as an efficient technique in perturbative calculations @xcite but also as a non - perturbative method to deal with strongly - interacting systems .",
    "we have extended the variational approach used by feynman @xcite for the polaron problem to simple super - renormalizable scalar field theories @xcite and to a renormalizable abelian gauge theory , viz .",
    "quantum electrodynamics @xcite . in this approach fields",
    "are eliminated and replaced by ( bosonic and fermionic ) worldlines parametrized by the proper time .",
    "recent progress includes more general trial actions @xcite , abraham - lorentz - like equations for the electron @xcite and treatment of the relativistic bound - state problem @xcite .",
    "in all these applications the `` quenched approximation '' was made , i.e. vacuum polarization graphs have been neglected .",
    "this allowed the functional integral over exchange fields ( mesons , photons ) to be performed . here",
    "we report on an attempt to include ( part of ) the vacuum polarization effects while keeping the huge reduction in the number of degrees of freedom which is characteristic for the worldline representation and essential for a successful variational approximation . in a simple scalar model where the heavy particles (  nucleons  ) with mass @xmath0 are described by an @xmath1-component field @xmath2 coupled to a `` meson '' field @xmath3 with mass @xmath4 via @xmath5",
    "this is achieved by expanding the functional determinant @xmath6 up to second order in the meson field . here",
    "@xmath7 is the _ free _ nucleon propagator .",
    "after integration over @xmath8 the linear terms give rise to tadpoles which do not contribute to the dynamics whereas the quadratic terms change the interaction part of the @xmath9-particle worldline action to @xmath10}{p^2 - m^2 - \\pi_r ( p^2 ) + i0 } \\ > .",
    "\\label{modified wl int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 is the renormalized one - loop vacuum - polarisation contribution to the meson propagator . it can be easily shown that @xmath12 grows logarithmically at large @xmath13 so that the nucleon mass renormalization remains unchanged while at small @xmath13 we obtain a quadratic behaviour .",
    "this implies that the vacuum polarization effects approximately amount to using an effective , reduced coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "hence , in this approach vacuum - polarization insertions into all meson lines are included ( see fig .",
    "1a ) .         to see its effects",
    "we have re - calculated the meson - nucleon form factor at @xmath15 which experiences an enhancement due to radiative effects ( as does the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in qed ) for various numbers of flavours @xmath1 . as shown in eq .",
    "( 38 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite one of the variational parameters in the one - particle sector directly determines the effective , physical coupling so that a numerical solution of the variational equations with the modified interaction ( [ modified wl int ] ) gives the results shown in fig .",
    "2 . as expected from the analytical approximation we observe a continous reduction with @xmath1 .     for different number of flavors",

    "the expansion of the determinant up to second order basically is a perturbative method and leaves out interactions of the pair - produced heavy particles with other nucleons , i.e. diagrams as shown in fig.1b . to include these interactions in a non - perturbative way one has to find a ( solvable ! ) trial action which contains meson fields and worldlines for the nucleons at the same time .",
    "this is provided by the linear polaron model of bogoliubov @xcite which is motivated by replacing the non - linear coupling between the @xmath3-field and each nucleon worldline @xmath16 by a linear one : @xmath17 in the new trial action @xmath18 and the unquenched meson propagator are taken as variational functions . by construction ,",
