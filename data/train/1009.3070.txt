    "many of the giant elliptical brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in the cores of massive clusters are surrounded by systems of filaments that produce a distinctive liner - like emission spectrum .",
    "these structures exist in ` cool - core ' clusters , which have centrally - peaked x - ray surface brightnesses .",
    "the densities and pressures are sufficiently high that the radiative - cooling timescales are less than a hubble time in the core . as a result , there should be large - scale condensation and inflow of cooling intra - cluster gas into the cluster center @xcite .",
    "however , recent observations show that much of the cooling of the cluster gas is being offset by heating associated with the central galaxy ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the current picture , the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) cooling",
    "is regulated by intermittent energy feedback from the central galaxies .",
    "potential heat sources include the mechanical energy of expanding radio lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , conduction from the cluster halo ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hot stars @xcite , and high - energy particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "cool - core clusters allow detailed studies of galaxy and agn feedback at relatively low redshift .",
    "they offer insight into analogous processes that occurred during galaxy growth in the high - redshift universe and into the physics needed to incorporate physical descriptions of feedback in galaxy formation models .",
    "the extensive , filamentary emission - line nebulae in cool - core cluster bcgs are likely to be products of the ongoing and inter - related processes of heating and cooling .",
    "however , many questions about the origin of the material in the filaments and the mechanisms that excite the emission spectrum remain largely unanswered .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed as sources of excitation in the filaments , including photoionization by radiation from the agn , cluster x - rays , or hot stars ( young or old ) ; collisional heating by high - energy particles , shocks or cloud - cloud collisions , and conduction of heat from the x - ray corona ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , none so far satisfactorily describes the characteristic spectra , energetics , and kinematics of the extended emission - line regions .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of bcgs reveal that material in a range of phases co - exists in the filaments .",
    "emission detected from various galaxies indicates the presence of cold co at 10 - 100k , mid - infrared - emitting h@xmath3 at 300 - 400k , molecular gas at 2000 - 3000k producing near - infrared h@xmath3 rovibrational lines , atomic gas at @xmath4k emitting atomic forbidden and hydrogen recombination lines , and a hot atomic component traced by x - ray emission at @xmath5k ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , these cooler gas phases are embedded in the hot , x - ray - emitting icm at @xmath6k .",
    "dust is also intermixed with the emission - line filaments in many systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are also systematic differences in the properties of the nebulae amongst clusters .",
    "surveys show that bcgs with more luminous line emission have : shorter cluster cooling times @xcite ; increased blue / uv excess emission @xcite ; greater ir luminosities @xcite ; larger masses of molecular gas associated with the filaments and galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and more extensive emission - line regions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is also a clear trend of decreasing ratios of hydrogen recombination to collisionally - excited forbidden line flux ( [ ] , [ ] ) with increasing total emission - line luminosity of the nebulae @xcite .",
    "strong ir and blue continuum excesses imply that significant star formation occurs in some bcgs .",
    "however , in many cases the emission spectrum does not resemble that from a purely star - forming region .",
    "these results have led some authors to conclude that several excitation mechanisms may participate , and contribute to varying degrees in different systems .",
    "@xcite suggested that sources of ` supplementary heating ' produce the liner - like properties of the spectra , though not necessarily through the same mechanism in all systems .",
    "similarly , @xcite propose that photoionization by hot young stars becomes increasingly dominant in high - luminosity systems over an underlying excitation source that produces the low - ionization ( liner - like ) spectrum and dominates the lower - luminosity nebulae .",
    "the nature of liner - producing component(s ) is uncertain , however .",
    "we present here a detailed study of the extended filaments surrounding the giant elliptical galaxy , the brightest cluster galaxy of the centaurus cluster ( abell 3526 ) .",
    "this is a relatively nearby system ( @xmath0 ) , in a cool - core cluster with peaked x - ray surface brightness in the center @xcite . from a pure cooling - flow model",
    "the inferred mass deposition rate is @xmath720  m@xmath8yr@xmath2 @xcite",
    ".    extended line emission around ngc  4696 was identified by @xcite , and the structures have been imaged in detail by @xcite .",
    "their narrow - band h@xmath9 images reveal a complex system of filaments that extends over 50(@xmath710kpc ) .",
    "the galaxy is a prototypical cool - core bcg in which the filaments can be spatially resolved and studied in some detail .",
    "the h@xmath9 luminosity of the galaxy emission places it at the low to intermediate end of the range of bcg line luminosity amonst the rosat brightest cluster sample compiled by @xcite .",
    "this sample spans four decades of h@xmath9 luminosity .",
    "the spectral properties are typical of lower - luminosity bcgs , exhibiting a very high ratio of [ ] to hydrogen recombination emission @xcite .",
    "since in this case the low - ionization ( liner - like ) properties dominate , we can investigate the nature of the liner excitation with less contamination from other sources of excitation .",
    "the host galaxy is a giant elliptical central cluster galaxy , but an extended cd stellar halo has not been detected @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness profile is peaked within the central few arcseconds and there is evidence from the hst i - band image of dual nuclei within the central arcsecond of the core ( @xmath70.2kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the measured central velocity dispersion ( 257  kms@xmath2 ) implies a central black hole mass on the order of @xmath10  m@xmath8 @xcite using the magorrian @xmath11 relation @xcite .",

    "the irregular lobes of radio emission of this source appear to have been highly distorted by the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "strong dust features are seen in the galaxy , including a conspicuous dust spiral @xcite that can be traced from the outer regions of the galaxy and in to the galaxy core @xcite .",
    "close correspondence between the optical emission and dust features is observed in a number of bcgs , and this is well - illustrated in ngc  4696 where dust lanes are associated with most of the extended optical filaments @xcite . the dust and line emission",
    "are concentrated to the south of the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the dust lane obscures the galaxy light , suggesting that it is positioned on the near side of the galaxy .",
    "that a large amount of dust exists in the filaments is a challenge to models in which the cool gas condenses from the hot icm , because dust is quickly , relative to the cooling timescale , destroyed by sputtering in the hot cluster halo environment @xcite .",
    "@xcite compare imaging of the extended emission of ngc  4696 in the radio , optical , and x - ray wavebands .",
    "the complex system of optical line - emitting filaments is closely traced by soft ( 0.3 - 1 kev ) x - ray emission .",
    "the striking resemblance between optical emission from warm gas at @xmath12k and x - rays from material at @xmath13k is also seen in other bcgs , e.g. m87 and ngc 1275 @xcite , and is another challenge for models of the excitation .",
    "the images of @xcite also illustrate that there is no clear correlation between the morphology of the radio emission and the optical filaments in this system . however , as observed in many cool - core clusters , the lobes of radio emission coincide with cavities in the high - energy x - ray emission from the icm @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the kinematics and excitation of the optical line emission detected in the filaments over the central 20 ( @xmath14kpc ) .",
    "our data show material that is spiralling inward to the galaxy nucleus and uniform excitation properties across the emission regions .",
    "the results support the proposal made by @xcite that the material in the emission - line filaments surrounding this galaxy originated in a neighboring dwarf galaxy that has undergone a recent merger with the bcg .",
    "we describe a scenario in which the line emission is excited by low - velocity shocks that are driven by the motion of the infalling material .",
    "we present shock models that reproduce the emission - line flux ratios observed in the gas and surmise that a minor - merger is energetically capable of exciting the observed emission .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath15kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , based on the five - year wmap results @xcite .",
    "ngc  4696 has a redshift of @xmath18 @xcite and the spatial scale is 0.21kpcarcsec@xmath2 .",
    "we assume a heliocentric distance to the galaxy of 44mpc .",
    "the observations of ngc  4696 were obtained with the wide - field spectrograph ( wifes ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the australian national university ( anu ) 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory .",
    "wifes is a double - beam , image - slicing , integral - field spectrograph that records optical spectra over a contiguous @xmath19  field - of - view .",
    "this spatial field is divided into twenty - five 1-wide ` slitlets ' , with 0.5sampling along the 38  length .",
    "the position angle of the slitlets on the sky was 305  during the observations of ngc  4696 .",
    "the wifes instrument is a dual - channel device with separate gratings and cameras for the blue and red channels .",
    "each camera is equipped with 4k@xmath204k pixel ccd detectors . in the low - resolution grating configuration that was used for these observations ( employing the r3000 and b3000 gratings and the rt560 dichroic ) , this provides a continuous wavelength coverage from 3290 to 9330  in the reduced data .",
    "the spectral sampling is 0.81 / pixel in the blue data cube and 1.31 / pixel in the red data cube .",
    "the average spectral resolution achieved was @xmath7100  kms@xmath2  fwhm .",
    "the observations of ngc  4696 were made on 14 - 17 april and 1 - 3 may 2009 .",
    "the nights were clear and the seeing ranged between approximately 1and 3 .",
    "multiple 30 minute exposures were obtained for each data set , for total on - source integration times of 14 hours with the blue camera and 18.5 hours with the red ( the blue detector was not available during part of the observing period ) . the pattern of science observations consisted of two pairs of galaxy frames separated by a 30 minute exposure of the sky .",
    "the scaled sky frame was subtracted from each of the four galaxy frames in this sequence .",
    "a dither pattern of 2offsets was applied to the position of each galaxy frame .",
    "a nearby reference star was used to autoguide the galaxy exposures .",
    "each set of four galaxy frames and one sky frame was preceded and followed by an observation of a spectrophotometric standard star ( ltt4364 , hd128279 , or eg131 ) and these were used to calibrate the absolute flux scale of the observations .",
    "dwarf stars with spectra that resemble a featureless blackbody ( including ltt4364 and eg131 ) were also measured during the night and used to remove atmospheric absorption features from the flux standard star and galaxy spectra .",
    "arc calibration lamp frames and quartz lamp flat - field frames were observed at the beginning of each night , and twilight sky flat - field frames were obtained once during each of the two observing periods .",
    "the data were reduced using the wifes iraf data reduction package @xcite , which is based on and utilizes the gemini iraf package .",
    "the procedure began by treating each frame as a 2d image .",
    "the detector bias signals were removed in the standard way , using the overscan regions of the raw frames . then the sky frame was scaled and subtracted from the bias - subtracted object frame .",
    "the spectrograph optically divides the field - of - view into slices along the long axis of the field .",
    "these ` slitlets ' are stacked end - to - end and dispersed across the detector , to form a series of 2d slit spectra from adjacent slices on the sky . in processing , the 2d spectrum from each slice was extracted from the bias- and sky - subtracted frame and placed in an individual fits image extension .",
    "standard methods for processing 2d spectra were then applied individually within each slice as described below .",
    "the flat - field frame is formed from exposures of a quartz - iodine lamp . within each slice ,",
    "the spectra were normalized , using a spline function fit to the spectral profiles .",
    "the shape of the lamp illumination in the spatial direction along the slices was corrected using twilight sky frames .",
    "an additional adjustment was made to maintain the relative signal levels between the slices .",
    "the final flat - field frame then retained only pixel - to - pixel variations in the spectral direction and the slit transmission profile in the spatial direction .",
    "these effects were subsequently removed from the science data by flat - fielding .",
    "each slice of the galaxy frames was corrected with the corresponding 2d slice from the flat - field frame .",
    "the individual 2d spectra were then transformed to a common spatial and spectral coordinate grid .",
    "near arc lamp frames were used to calibrate the spectral scales of the slices .",
    "the iraf identify task was used to match the emission features in the arc lamp spectra , and fitcoords was used to apply the spectral coordinate solution to the science data , slice by slice .",
    "the average rms error in the fit to the arc - line positions is 0.2for the red cube and 0.1for the blue cube .",
    "for the spatial alignment , an occulting wire is available at an intermediate focus within the instrument .",
    "this provides a convenient spatial registration when the aperture is illuminated by the flat - field lamp .",
    "an image of the wire is seen near the center of each slitlet and this establishes the origin of the spatial coordinates in each slice .",
    "we assume a standard spatial scale of 0.5per pixel along the slices .",
    "the data were resampled onto a common rectilinear grid by the transform task and the 2d slices were then stacked together to form a 3d data cube .",
    "the ends of the spectra were trimmed from the reduced data cubes to remove the regions of low sensitivity in the grating+dichroic transmission profile .",
    "approximately 1050 and 550 were removed from the short wavelength end of the red and blue cubes , respectively , and approximately 420 and 160 from the long wavelength end of the cubes .",
    "this still provided @xmath21 of overlap between the cubes .",
    "the trimmed regions do not extend to within 400 of the emission lines measured .",
    "telluric absorption features were corrected in the red galaxy spectra using an integrated spectrum from a reduced smooth - spectrum standard star data cube .",
    "we normalized the spectrum to remove the continuum and obtain a spectrum containing only atmospheric absorption features .",
    "this was compared to the absorption features seen in the galaxy spectra , scaled and shifted as required , and used to correct the galaxy data using the iraf telluric task . after removing the telluric features from a standard star data cube ,",
    "an integrated flux - standard spectrum was extracted and the standard iraf flux - calibration tasks used to calibrate the spectra in the galaxy data cubes .",
    "the spectra across the whole field are corrected for the shape of the spectral transmission profile as measured at the position of the standard star ( approximately the center of the field ) .",
    "the flux calibration was performed without correcting for atmospheric extinction in the individual data frames .",
    "the variation in continuum flux among the frames gives an indication of the uncertainties in the flux calibration : there is a 1@xmath22 variation of @xmath23% , attributable to the changing airmass ( the galaxy altitude was between 1 to 1.4 airmasses during the observations ) and fluctuations in sky transparency .",
    "each science frame was individually reduced by using the procedures described above .",
    "the dithered galaxy data cubes were then spatially registered using the continuum centroid of the galaxy nucleus .",
    "this was measured for both the red and blue cubes , using an image formed by summing several spectral planes in a line - free region near the center of the spectrum .",
    "the cubes were then offset as required and median - combined with the iraf task imcombine .",
    "cosmic rays and detector defects were removed in this process .",
    "measuring the flux of the extended line - emission regions surrounding ngc  4696 is complicated by the strong stellar continuum .",
    "this dominates the spectrum in most regions and must be removed to extract accurate emission - line fluxes .",
    "this can be done using the galaxy itself , rather than attempting to generate a theoretical stellar continuum template .    since the distribution of line emission around ngc  4696 is asymmetric",
    "( see section  [ sec : morph ] ) and the filaments do not extend beyond approximately 5 to 10 from the galaxy center to the north and east of the nucleus , we were able to extract a spectrum from a region of the inner galaxy that is free from line emission and use this to subtract the stellar component from the spectra at other locations .",
    "the representative galaxy spectrum is constructed from a 3-diameter aperture placed @xmath24  to the north - east of the continuum center , where no line emission is detected in either the red or blue data cubes , as close to the galaxy core as possible . for each of the strong spectral emission features of interest ,",
    "this spectrum was scaled to match the flux level of the continuum in neighboring spectral regions ( using the average level in two bands approximately 35  wide bracketing the line or complex of lines and centered within 50  of the feature ) , before it was subtracted at each spatial pixel .",
    "an estimate of the error introduced in this process is made in the following section .",
    "after subtracting the galaxy stellar continuum , we extracted the flux of the emission lines that are detected at better than the 3@xmath22 level .",
    "this corresponds to a line surface brightness @xmath25  ergs@xmath2@xmath26arcsec@xmath27 in the red data cube and @xmath28  ergs@xmath2@xmath26arcsec@xmath27 in the blue for a line width of 300  kms@xmath2 .",

    "radial velocities are given relative to the velocity of the galaxy with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "the velocities have been corrected for the motion of the earth with respect to the local standard of rest ; the magnitude of the correction required was less than 9.5  kms@xmath2for all observations .",
    "the instrumental resolution has been removed from the fitted line widths by subtracting in quadrature the average value of 97  kms@xmath2  fwhm that was measured from an arc lamp calibration image .",
    "the results derived from the data cube and the emission - line fits are discussed in the following sections .",
    "uncertainties in the relative line flux measurements were estimated using the noise properties of the spectra after continuum subtraction . for a given emission line ,",
    "the @xmath32 error in the flux density per pixel was taken to be the standard deviation in a line - free region adjacent to the feature .",
    "these were combined in quadrature to form the uncertainties in the integrated line flux .",
    "figure  [ fig : intspec ] shows the integrated spectrum from a 5-diameter circular aperture centered on the core of ngc  4696 , prior to subtracting the galaxy continuum . forbidden lines of , and , and the h@xmath9 recombination line are prominent , but the spectrum is dominated by a stellar continuum component that is typical of an early - type galaxy .",
    "the strength of the continuum increases toward longer wavelengths and exhibits absorption features characteristic of evolved stellar populations : e.g. ca k and h lines ( at 3934  and 3969 , respectively ) , g band ( ch@xmath33 ; 4300 ) , blended mg i b ( 5175 ) , na i d blended doublet ( 5893 ) , and the broad tio feature ( 7126 ) .",
    "in addition , the step in the average continuum intensity across the 4000 - break ( @xmath34 ) is typical of values in elliptical galaxies , including those of the low line - luminosity bcgs in the rosat ` brightest cluster sample ' of @xcite .",
    "the galaxy spectrum shows no evidence for a blue stellar component that would indicate that significant star formation is occurring .",

    "lanes of absorption also coincide with outer filaments to the south and west of the main filament .",
    "the association of the line emission and dust absorption features indicates that the observed system of gas and dust is inclined towards us , is on the near side of the galaxy , and has an intrinsically one - sided spiral distribution about the galaxy .",
    "the peak in surface brightness of the extended emission occurs approximately 3(0.6kpc ) to the north - west of the galaxy center .",
    "this peak occurs inside the curve of the dust lane .",
    "the spatial association of the main filament with the dust lane is very clear in the outer extent of the filaments .",
    "close to the nucleus , however , the main dust spiral departs from the ridge line of the line emission along the filament .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : dustlane ] , the filament of optical emission bends toward the nucleus from the north - west , whereas the dust spiral continues around to the north of the core and finally turns towards the nucleus from the north - east .",
    "if the ridge of emission tracks a shock front , as proposed below , this might indicate that the shock front is progressively propagating through the dust lane as the dusty gas spirals in towards the nucleus .",
    "the morphology of the emission from weaker lines such as [ ] and [ ] is consistent with that of the strong emission lines ( hence are not pictured in figure  [ fig : linemaps ] ) . to the degree that our spatial resolution reveals",
    ", it appears that all the optical forbidden and hydrogen recombination emission lines originate in the same gas .",
    "the integral - field data permit us to determine the total emission - line luminosity of the filaments , which is useful to constrain both the mass and energy budgets .",
    "the flux measurements from the emission - line fits are summed over all the pixels where the value is greater than the 3@xmath22 detection limit to obtain a total line flux .",
    "the total flux detected in h@xmath9 is @xmath76  ergs@xmath2@xmath26 prior to correcting for extinction .",
    "the reddening in the observations is estimated from measured h@xmath9/h@xmath30 line flux ratios as described in section  [ sec : linemaps ] .",
    "since h@xmath30 is relatively faint , we do not detect it over the same spatial extent as we measure the total h@xmath9 flux .",
    "this restricts our ability to map the spatial variation of the extinction . in spatial pixels where both lines are detected above the 5@xmath22 detection limit",
    ", the extinction correction is determined from the h@xmath9/h@xmath30 line ratio measured in that pixel .",
    "everywhere else , we assume an average extinction level of @xmath77mag . this value is determined from the integrated line fluxes over the region where both h@xmath9 and h@xmath30 are detected .",
    "the line luminosity is then derived by summing the individually extinction - corrected fluxes from each pixel .",
    "this results in an extinction - corrected , integrated h@xmath9 flux of @xmath78  ergs@xmath2@xmath26 . at a distance of 44mpc ,",
    "the h@xmath9 line luminosity is then @xmath79  ergs@xmath2 .",

    "this larger volume is unlikely to be spherical , so a more appropriate estimate might be obtained within a more constrained region of the filaments .",
    "we assume the emitting material from the 3-diameter aperture used in section  [ sec : linemaps ] and table  [ tab : fluxes ] , at the line peak , is distributed over a spherical volume of radius @xmath100 cm . from equation  [ eq : massh ] ,",

    ", this implies a total gas mass on the order of @xmath108  m@xmath8 .",
    "such estimates of dust mass can not fully take into account the total gas mass , if the dust clouds become optically thick and therefore cool .",
    "the mass in bcg line - emitting filaments is believed to be dominated by molecular material in such cloud cores . @xcite",
    "have measured co emission in a sample of luminous cool - core galaxies that is consistent with the presence of @xmath109  m@xmath8 of molecular gas at @xmath110k in these galaxies .",
    "using figure 10 of their paper , along with the inferred mass deposition rate for ngc  4696 of 20  m@xmath8yr@xmath2 from @xcite then implies a molecular gas mass of @xmath105  m@xmath8 in ngc  4696 , in close agreement with the value inferred by @xcite from the dust obscuration . in ngc  4696 , @xcite derive a mass of warm h@xmath3 of @xmath111  m@xmath8 , from emission within their spitzer spectrograph aperture and estimate that approximately 10 times more mass may exist at cooler temperatures .",
    "as previously , we adopt an average reddening of @xmath112 along the extent of the main filament . assuming a galactic gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath113@xmath26mag@xmath2 @xcite , a length of 32 , and width of 2over which the emission in the filament is measured",
    ", we can make a rough estimate of the mass of material obscuring the line - emission region of @xmath114  m@xmath8 .",
    "this estimate is a lower limit for total mass because the ionized gas can not be located entirely behind a dusty foreground screen , but is more likely mixed in with it . over the total area of the line - emitting filaments ,",
    "using the same average reddening , the resulting limit on the total mass is @xmath115  m@xmath8 .",

    "it is most likely that this mass is largely in a cool , dusty , and dense molecular phase .",
    "there have been a number of long - slit spectroscopic studies of the kinematics of the gas in ngc  4696 .",

    "in addition , @xcite detect sodium absorption features in continuum - subtracted long - slit spectra that have similar kinematics to the emission - line gas along both position angles observed .",
    "the measured line - of - sight velocities are between 0 and 450  kms@xmath2 .",
    "there is a cold , neutral component that is associated with the ionized filaments .",
    "they comment that this would not be expected in a cooling - flow model , but is consistent with a merger .",
    "our integral - field spectroscopy greatly improves our ability to map the velocity dispersions and kinematics of the line - emitting gas .",

    "ridges of higher dispersion ( 160 - 200  kms@xmath2 ) appear in the maps , but the dispersions in these regions are consistent with ` beam - smearing ' caused by our finite spatial resolution , which results in an increase in apparent velocity dispersion in regions of a steep spatial gradient in line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the measured velocity dispersions from the h@xmath9 and [ ] lines are effectively identical .",
    "the velocity dispersions in the main filament are significantly lower than the rotational / bulk velocities of the gas : without correcting for inclination , the ratio of rotation to turbulent velocity ranges from 1 to 2 in this structure .",
    "the central stellar velocity dispersion in the galaxy is also a factor of two larger than the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the line emission .",
    "the velocity dispersion is much larger than the thermal broadening ( @xmath77  kms@xmath2at 10@xmath119k for hydrogen ) and is therefore either generated by shocks or by the superposition of large - scale random turbulent motions .",
    "the main filament has broader lines and higher line - of - sight velocities than the outer filament arm to the south , in which the average velocity dispersion ranges from @xmath760  kms@xmath2to @xmath790  kms@xmath2and the line - of - sight velocity from @xmath7100  kms@xmath2to @xmath7150  kms@xmath2 .",

    "the velocity distribution of the line - emitting gas shows an ordered structure with a component of rotation in the nebula .",
    "the velocity maps derived from the line centroid positions for other ions are essentially identical to the [ ] and h@xmath9 velocity maps shown in figure  [ fig : linemaps ] , indicating that the hydrogen recombination and forbidden lines in the optical spectrum originate from the same gas .",
    "the emission from the ionized gas is largely redshifted to the south of the galaxy center and blue - shifted to the north .",
    "there is a smooth variation in the line - of - sight velocity along the principal filament that traces the dust spiral .",
    "the velocity increases inward along the filament as it bends around the galaxy to the south of the core , and then decreases to become blue - shifted as the filament curves to the north past the galaxy nucleus . as a result ,",
    "the kinematics of the gas in this filament resemble orbital motions : if the material is infalling , then the filament is inclined so that the outermost end is nearest to us and the material recedes along the filament to the south of the core , before turning around on the far side of the galaxy core onto an approaching trajectory to the north of the nucleus .    at the outer end of the main filament at a radius of 13 ( 2.7kpc ) ,",
    "the average line - of - sight velocity of the emitting gas is 180  kms@xmath2 .",
    "this velocity increases to 280  kms@xmath2 at a radius of 6.5(1.4kpc ) in the filament to the south - west .",
    "the maximum blueshifted velocity is 150  kms@xmath2 at a radius of 7(1.5kpc ) to the north of the core .",

    "the orbital timescale implied by material at a galactic radius of 1.5kpc travelling at velocity @xmath124  kms@xmath2 is @xmath125yr . taking the total gas mass ( from section  [ sec : linelum ] ) as @xmath126  m@xmath8",
    ", the kinetic energy of the gas would be @xmath127erg .",
    "if this energy is radiated away by shocks on the timescale of a single orbit , the luminosity produced would be @xmath128  ergs@xmath2 .",
    "the h@xmath9 line luminosity from our line measurements is @xmath79  ergs@xmath2 , and from the shock models presented below , this is about 0.7% of the total luminosity .",
    "thus , our estimated total shock luminosity is @xmath129  ergs@xmath2 , in good agreement with our kinematic estimate of this quantity .",
    "previous long - slit spectroscopy of ngc  4696 has shown that the extended filaments produce emission with a high ratio of [ ] to h@xmath9 flux @xcite .",
    "we confirm this result .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluxratios ] shows that the ratio of [ ] /h@xmath9 is roughly constant at @xmath130 with remarkably little variation in the value ( @xmath75% ) across the inner filaments of the galaxy .",
    "this average value of the [ ] /h@xmath9 flux ratio and the h@xmath9 luminosity of the system reported in section  [ sec : linelum ] are consistent with other bcg emission systems of similar luminosity @xcite .",
    "these results show that the characteristic line ratios such as the high [ ] flux relative to h@xmath9 and dominance of the other low - ionization species , are not simply nuclear phenomena confined to the galactic core , but persist over the extent of the detected emission in the filaments .",
    "in addition , the uniformity of the emission - line flux ratios across the inner filaments implies that whatever mechanism excites this spectrum is acting over the full extent ( 25or 5kpc ) of the detected filaments .",
    "this finding contrasts with results from other bcg filament systems .",
    "for example , @xcite placed a spectrograph slit along several of the filaments in ngc  1275 and found the [ ] /h@xmath9 ratio decreases along the filaments with distance from the galaxy .",
    "the authors suggest that this may be the result of either decreasing metallicity or changing excitation , such as greater specific star formation activity closer to the nucleus .",
    "unlike ngc  4696 , ngc  1275 is a very line - luminous system among bcgs and there is clear evidence of star - forming clouds associated with the extended filaments .",
    "@xcite compare optical ifu observations of the extended emission in a sample of cooling - flow and non - cooling - flow bcgs .",
    "they find diverse emission properties and morphologies among their sample , including a range of behavior in the variation of the [ ] /h@xmath9 line flux ratios .",
    "in general , they attribute lower [ ] /h@xmath9 ratios to regions where young stars contribute most of the ionising flux .",
    "they conclude that the ionization mechanisms that produce the optical line emission are not uniform amongst the sample and represent a complex interplay between an agn , cooling cluster gas , and star formation that may be triggered by agn outbursts and/or tidal interactions with other galaxies .    in ifu observations of a sample of other bcgs with a range of h@xmath9 luminosities ,",
    "@xcite find different degrees of [ ] /h@xmath9 variation in the observed systems .",
    "for example , in rxj 0821 + 0752 there is a distinct correlation between the low [ ] /h@xmath9 and h@xmath9 flux , whereas in the bcg of abell 2390 there is less variation , but in general higher [ ] /h@xmath9 ratios are associated with dust lanes and lower ratios with knots of blue emission .",
    "this may also reflect the trend amongst bcgs to display weaker forbidden emission in high - luminosity systems with abundant star formation ( as evidenced by blue knots ) .",
    "@xcite found little variation in the flux ratios over the measured extent of nebulae surrounding four high - luminosity systems . if , as suspected , such systems are dominated by more widespread regions of star formation , the emission - line ratios may be simply consistent with photoionization by hot stars . on this hypothesis",
    ", they suggested that in lower - luminosity systems the flux ratios might show more spatial variation with higher [ ] /h@xmath9 ratios away from the less - abundant star - forming clumps .",
    "ngc  4696 may represent the low - luminosity extreme of this model , as there are no detectable star - forming regions associated with the filaments . in this case , the underlying low - ionization excitation mechanism dominates everywhere .",
    "m87 , low line - luminosity bcg of the virgo cluster , may be a similar example , though in this case observations resolve the core of the galaxy and the emission - line ratios associated with the extended emission differ from those of the nucleus .",
    "the extended filaments produce a typically liner - type spectrum @xcite , found by @xcite to be consistent with shock models , whereas the higher - ionization emission from the core is consistent with excitation by photoionization @xcite .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath30 ratio is a powerful diagnostic of the excitation of the gas .",
    "this ratio is also measurable in the central regions of the filaments in our data , though the signal - to - noise ratio is much reduced as a result of the overall weaker line emission .",
    "we find little evidence of a variation in the value over the inner filament .",
    "however , there is evidence for a slight increase in the ratio at the galaxy core , where the value may be enhanced by radiation from the ( weak ) agn in this system .",
    "this effect can be seen in the line flux maps of figure  [ fig : linemaps ] , as the peak of the [ ] emission is closer to the galaxy core than the peak of the hydrogen lines .",
    "however , over most of the extent of the filaments , the line ratios , including [ ] /h@xmath30 , do not indicate a dominant contribution from agn photoionization .",
    "the main filament uniformly produces a low - ionization ( liner - like ) emission spectrum ( see section  [ sec : diagd ] .",
    "we do not detect @xmath725876 , which is sometimes seen in more h@xmath9-luminous bcg systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the intrinsic velocity dispersion in the ionized gas causes the [ ] @xmath131doublet to be unresolved in our spectra .",

    "the [ ] flux ratio is uniform over the brightest regions in the filaments , with a 1@xmath22 variation of 0.2 in the value .",
    "the most commonly - used optical diagnostic line - flux diagrams were developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these employ strong lines that are close in wavelength to decrease the effect of reddening on the ratios .",
    "such diagnostic diagrams are often used in classifying galaxies and identifying agn versus starburst - dominated systems by distinguishing different ionization mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bpt ] , we plot the flux ratios from table  [ tab : fluxes ] at the emission - line peak on the common diagnostic diagrams .",

    "the typical line ratios from table  [ tab : fluxes ] for ngc  4696 are plotted along with the integrated line ratios measured by @xcite for a sample of x - ray - selected bcgs .",

    "these demonstrate clearly the liner - like properties of the filament spectrum of ngc  4696 , typical of a low h@xmath9-luminosity system .",
    "thus any conclusions that apply to the mode of excitation of ngc  4696 may be applicable to other low - luminosity bcgs .",
    "there is extensive work in the literature that addresses the question of how the mass of brightest cluster galaxies is assembled , including the fraction of the mass that may be obtained through merger and accretion events .",
    "the bulk of the mass of brightest cluster ellipticals is believed to have been assembled in this way .",
    "bcgs are located in the densest galactic environments and the galaxy luminosities are weakly correlated with the cluster richness , x - ray luminosity , and velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , signs that they are products of their host cluster environment .",
    "there is also a high frequency of multiple nuclei amongst bcgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have already accumulated a variety of evidence to support the idea proposed by @xcite that the filaments of ngc  4696 represent the infalling remnants of a minor merger with a neighboring gas - rich cluster galaxy :    * the kinematics of the emission - line gas show that the main spiral - shaped filament in ncc  4696 is a coherent structure consisting of material with infalling , orbital motions . *",
    "the one - sided distribution of the emission - line streams is also readily explained by the accretion of another galaxy , infalling on a timescale comparable to the orbital timescale . * as @xcite point out , the presence of large quantities of dust , and molecular , neutral , and ionized gas in the filaments is also consistent with a merger origin . * as discussed in section  [ sec : linelum ] , there is evidence that the mass of material associated with the filaments is equivalent to that of a low - mass dwarf galaxy , of order a few times @xmath116  m@xmath8 .",
    "however , this mass is much less than the inferred mass of ncc  4696 , so the infall does not represent a major perturbation to the elliptical galaxy .",
    "it is therefore a minor merger .",
    "* imaging of the core of ngc  4696 shows evidence for at least two nuclear components in the galaxy @xcite . *",
    "the emission - line gas is characterized by a velocity dispersion of @xmath118  kms@xmath2 , characteristic of being shock - excited . * as discussed in section [ sec : kinematics ] , the total emission - line luminosity from shocks is consistent with the estimated rate of dissipation of orbital energy in the filaments .",
    "in such a merger event , the dissipation of the orbital energy occurs through the drag forces generated by the motion of the merging galaxy gas through the hot galactic halo of the bcg .",
    "shocks generated in the infalling gas would dissipate the orbital motion in this model , and therefore the signatures of shock excitation should be present .",
    "we investigate this possibility below .",
    "we have run a grid of radiative shock models using the photoionization and shock modelling code mappings iii , an updated version of the code described in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for these simulations is a model in which the filaments are comprised of clouds of cool gas that are remnants of a recently accreted , gas - rich , neighboring dwarf galaxy .",
    "these clouds are falling into the hot ism halo of ngc  4696 , which is compressed and heated by the ram pressure of the cloud s motion .",
    "the increased external pressure drives shocks into the cooler , dense cloud gas .",
    "the cooling time in the dense cloud material is short , so the cloud shocks are radiative and the observed optical line emission is produced in the cooling region behind the shocks .",
    "figure  [ fig : shockdiagram ] shows a simple schematic of this model and is further discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .    in the 1d plane - parallel shock models ,",
    "the pre - shock medium is taken to be the warm atomic component of the infalling gas , rather than the dense molecular medium that is visible in the dust absorption .",
    "the reason for this choice is as follows .",
    "the total surface brightness of a radiative shock of velocity @xmath134 propagating into a medium of pre - shock density @xmath96 scales as the mechanical energy flux through the shock @xmath135 . for a system of shocks propagating into a fractal medium with a wide range of temperatures , the driving ( ram ) pressure @xmath136  constant . thus @xmath137 and therefore @xmath138 .",
    "high density regions do not significantly contribute to the total shock luminosity , not only because of this density - dependent factor , but also because the fractional filling factor of the denser cloud gas is small , reducing the total area that can radiate .",
    "furthermore , in shocks propagating into molecular gas , the dominant luminosity is in collisionally - excited h@xmath139 infrared emission , not in atomic line emission",
    ". indeed infrared emission lines from h@xmath3 gas are also seen , and their luminosity is correlated with the optical line emission @xcite , suggesting that these are produced by a common shock mechanism .",
    "the ionization state of the material prior to processing by the shocks ( the pre - ionization ) and the shock velocity are treated as independent parameters in the models .",
    "the shock velocity is varied between 80 and 220  kms@xmath2 in intervals of 20  kms@xmath2 , and the pre - ionization from neutral ( i.e. the fraction of ionized hydrogen is @xmath140 ) to fully ionized ( @xmath141 ) , with the fraction of hydrogen that is ionized in the pre - shock material increasing in steps of 0.1 . a transverse magnetic field that is consistent with equipartition of thermal and magnetic field energy",
    "is assumed ( @xmath142 g for @xmath143@xmath91 ; @xmath144 ) .",
    "no external radiation field was added .",
    "the gas abundances in table  [ tab : abund ] are taken from those presented by @xcite , with typical dust depletion factors , since dust physics is not treated explicitly in these models .",
    "observations of the centaurus cluster show that the icm gas abundance in the vicinity of the galaxy and filaments is @xmath145 @xcite and this overall metallicity is used in the models .",

    "this ratio might be lower if there are faster ( non - radiative ) shocks in the infalling gas , as these could provide soft x - ray luminosity associated with the infalling gas , rather than the shocked ism .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that the gas - dynamic drag of the hot ism is an important factor in determining the accretion timescale of the infalling gas towards the nucleus .",
    "although liner emission in galaxies is frequently a nuclear phenomenon , there are a range of galactic environments that host extended , extra - nuclear , liner - like emission regions .",
    "other than cool - core cluster bcgs , these include galactic winds , agn jets , and interacting or merging galaxies .",
    "a link between liner - like emission and shock excitation was proposed in early studies of liner galaxies and has since been extensively discussed and debated in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "most interesting in the context of this paper , are recent findings that increasingly point to shock excitation of liner - like emission in the tidal regions of galaxy mergers and interactions . @xcite present spitzer observations of the luminous infrared emission associated with the double galaxy system 3c 326 .",
    "the northern galaxy of the pair produces strong h@xmath3 line emission and a liner - type optical spectrum .",
    "the authors investigate several heating mechanisms for the ir emission and conclude that the molecular hydrogen spectrum may be powered by accretion shocks that arise in inflows induced by tidal interactions between the two galaxies .",
    "@xcite investigate the ionization of the extended emission regions in a sample of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) using integral - field spectroscopy .",
    "they find that the emission in isolated systems is generally consistent with ionization by radiation from young stars .",
    "however , large fractions of the emission spectra from the extended regions in interacting pairs and more advanced mergers are consistent with ionization by shocks with velocities of @xmath216  kms@xmath2 . in their model ,",
    "the shocks are generated by tidally - induced , high - velocity flows that can be a result of the merging process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . while ngc  4696 is not such an ir - luminous system : @xmath219l@xmath218 @xcite , results like those discussed above support the suggestion that infall and merger activity provides a mechanism for generating galaxy - wide liner - like emission through intermediate - velocity shock excitation",
    "lastly , we note the observations presented by @xcite of the bcg system in the ophiuchus cluster , which make an interesting comparison with our results for ngc  4696 . in ophiuchus",
    ", the bcg does not produce detectable line emission , but is accompanied by a nearby extended object that emits strong low - ionization optical lines .",
    "this object is @xmath220kpc from the center of the bcg on the sky and is separated by 600  kms@xmath2 in radial velocity .",
    "the red emission line ratios fall in the agn or liner regions of the diagnostic diagrams , but the [ ] /h@xmath30 ratio is not available to distinguish between these classes . the authors conclude that it is most likely that the emission is produced within a large gas cloud falling towards the bcg through the galaxy halo .",
    "it is possible that the emission in this structure is excited by the ram pressure of its motion through the hot atmosphere of the bcg , as in the model we have discussed here .",
    "the ophiuchus system may be in the early stages of a process of minor merger like the one that has occurred in ngc  4696 .",
    "further study is needed to better understand the nature of the interaction .",
    "our ifu observation of the extended emission surrounding ngc 4696 provides a picture of material falling in along the bright curved filament that encircles the core of the galaxy , with an emission - line spectrum - and hence excitation mechanism - that exhibits uniform properties over the inner filaments .",
    "the kinematics indicate ` orbital ' trajectories , spiralling in toward the galaxy nucleus .",
    "in addition to other observational data that provide evidence for a recent merger event in the system , this prompts us to investigate a model in which the extended emission - line filaments form from the stripping of material during a minor merger event that also provides the source of energy that excites the line emission . in this model ,",
    "the infalling clouds in the filaments are remnants of a low - mass , gas - rich ( containing approximately @xmath116",
    "m@xmath8gas ) cluster dwarf galaxy captured in the potential of the bcg . the motion of the filaments through the hot icm produces bow waves that drive shocks into the clouds themselves .",
    "we present mappings models of the cooling behind these shocks and find that the optical emission - line spectrum is well - matched by @xmath7180  kms@xmath2 shocks propagating into ionized gas .",
    "the minor - merger scenario described here has the benefit of naturally accounting for the high densities and pressures in the filaments relative to the surrounding medium ( unlike direct cooling models that assume that the filaments are in pressure equilibrium with the environment ) .",
    "it also explains the kinematic properties of the filaments , and is energetically self - consistent .",
    "furthermore , the presence of large quantities of dust closely associated with the optical filaments is consistent with the model of an infalling satellite .",
    "excitation by low - velocity shocks is a mechanism that may be capable of explaining the underlying liner - like properties of the extended filament emission in central cluster galaxies .",
    "although such shocks may not be always driven by infall or mergers , there is an interesting parallel between the properties of the filaments in ngc  4696 and those of emission regions in lirgs , which have been attributed to tidally - induced accretion shocks .",
