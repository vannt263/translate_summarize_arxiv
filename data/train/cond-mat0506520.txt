    "a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an optical trap  @xcite exhibits a rich variety of spin - related phenomena , such as various magnetic phases  @xcite and spin domain formation  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear spin of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is @xmath4 , and combined with the spin @xmath5 of the outermost electron , the possible hyperfine spins of these atomic species are @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath6 bec was first realized at mit with @xmath8  @xcite , for which the antiferromagnetic behavior was observed  @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath2 in the @xmath6 hyperfine state was found to be ferromagnetic  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 @xmath3 condensate was also realized by the mit group  @xcite , whose ground state phase at zero magnetic field is predicted to be antiferromagnetic  @xcite .",
    "however , the ground state phase and the spin dynamics of the @xmath7 @xmath3 bec have not been studied because of its very short lifetime ( a few milliseconds ) , due to the fact that the energy of the @xmath9 state is higher than that of the @xmath6 state .",
    "the @xmath7 @xmath2 bec also lies energetically higher than its @xmath6 counterpart , but its lifetime is much larger ( @xmath10 ms ) due to a fortuitous coincidence of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths  @xcite .",
    "the coherent spin dynamics of the @xmath7 bec have been observed  @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath7 bec of @xmath2 is predicted to be very close to the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and cyclic phases  @xcite . according to calculations performed by klausen _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , the ground state phase of this bec at zero magnetic field is barely in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "recent experiments performed by the hamburg group  @xcite and by the gakushuin group  @xcite appear to support this prediction .",
    "however , due to the experimental uncertainties , the possibility that the ground state phase is cyclic has not been excluded . in the hamburg experiment  @xcite , the @xmath11 mixture was shown to be stable , which is the ground state of the antiferromagnetic phase . however",
    ", a magnetic field of 340 mg was applied to the system in this experiment .",
    "since the magnetic field lowers the energy of the @xmath11 states due to the quadratic zeeman effect , the observed stability of the @xmath11 mixture may be due to the presence of the magnetic field . that there is",
    "no spatial separation between the @xmath11 states is a necessary condition for a bec to be antiferromagnetic , but it is not sufficient . in the gakushuin experiment",
    "@xcite , the spin dynamics starting from the @xmath12 state were investigated for various values of the magnetic field .",
    "it was found that the population of the @xmath11 components after 70 ms evolution increased with a decrease of the magnetic field , which might imply that the @xmath7 bec is antiferromagnetic at zero magnetic field . however , the initial @xmath12 state is a highly excited state and the resultant state after 70 ms is far above the ground state .",
    "thus , the experimental observations do not exclude the possibility that the ground state phase at zero magnetic field is cyclic .",
    "in fact , the hamburg group observed that the spin configuration of the cyclic phase has a long lifetime  @xcite .",
    "there are two experimental difficulties that hinder the determination of the ground state phase .",
    "one is the short lifetime of @xmath13 100 ms of the upper hyperfine manifold of @xmath2 , which makes the equilibrium spin state hard to reach . in order to realize the ground state phase , we must equilibrate the system at least for a few seconds , as in the @xmath6 case  @xcite .",
    "the other difficulty is the small energy scale ( @xmath14 0.1 nk  @xcite ) of the spin - singlet - pair term whose sign determines the ground state phase . in order to determine the sign of the spin - singlet pair energy , the magnetic field",
    "must be reduced so that the quadratic zeeman energy is less than the spin - singlet pair energy . however , in such a low magnetic field the system may be affected by stray ac magnetic fields  @xcite .    to circumvent these difficulties ,",
    "we propose a method to determine the value of the spin - singlet pair energy by spin exchange dynamics .",
    "we show that by controlling the initial population and phase in each magnetic sublevel , we can measure the value of the singlet - pair energy from the initial spin dynamics .",
    "this method therefore has the advantage that equilibrating the system , which takes a long time , is not necessary .",
    "furthermore , the quadratic zeeman energy is allowed to exceed the singlet - pair energy and extreme suppression of stray magnetic fields is not required .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : bogo ] formulates the mean field and bogoliubov theories of a spin-2 bec in the presence of the quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "section  [ s : homo ] studies the spin dynamics in a homogeneous system and proposes a method to determine the spin - singlet pair energy from the spin exchange dynamics .",

    "from rotational symmetry , the low - energy interaction between two atoms with hyperfine spin @xmath15 can be classified in terms of the total spin @xmath16 , and each scattering channel can be described by the corresponding @xmath17-wave scattering length @xmath18  @xcite . in the case of @xmath7",

    "we note that the linear zeeman term only rotates the hyperfine spin about the @xmath47 axis , and hence the spin dynamics are essentially independent of the linear zeeman term .",

    "which is isolated from the environment , the total spin angular momentum in the direction of the magnetic field is conserved for a long time ( @xmath52 1 sec )  @xcite .",
