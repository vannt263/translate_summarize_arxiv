    "the hectospec is a powerful fiber - fed spectrograph at the mmt observatory in routine operation since april 2004 . during its first year of operation , hectospec obtained 60,000 spectra during 79 scheduled nights , with 48 nights of clear weather .",
    "hectochelle , hectospec s high dispersion partner spectrograph , was scheduled for an additional 31 nights . in total ,",
    "hectospec and hectochelle were scheduled for 1/3 of the available mmt nights . during hectospec s first year , it served 16 scientific programs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite outline the basic design of the hectospec fiber positioner , its bench spectrograph , and optical fiber probes . here",
    ", we emphasize : ( 1 ) the design refinements that occurred between 1998 and hectospec s delivery to the telescope in august 2003 and ( 2 ) hectospec s performance at the telescope .",
    "the mmt s f/5 optical system is comprised of a 6.5 m primary mirror , a 1.7 m secondary mirror , a series of large telescope baffles , a large refractive corrector , and a wave front sensor used periodically to correct the figure of the primary mirror and the telescope collimation .",
    "@xcite contains an overview of these components . @xcite and @xcite describe the f/5 secondary and its support . @xcite and",
    "@xcite discuss the f/5 wide field corrector in more detail .",
    "@xcite describe the shack - hartmann f/5 wave front sensor .",
    "the wide field corrector has two modes of operation . for wide field spectroscopy with optical fibers ,",
    "the corrector provides a 1@xmath3 diameter field of view on a curved but telecentric focal surface 0.6 meters in diameter .",
    "the sag of the spectroscopic focal surface is 8 mm . in the imaging mode",
    ", the corrector provides a field of view 0.58@xmath3 in diameter on a flat focal surface .",
    "the spectroscopic mode of the corrector includes counterrotating atmospheric dispersion compensation prisms that are removed for the imaging mode .",
    "the commissioning of hectospec required the prior installation of the 1.7 meter f/5 secondary mirror at the mmt , which took place in april 2003 .",
    "the wide field corrector and the f/5 wave front sensor were commissioned during may and june 2003 .",
    "the first commissioning run with hectospec took place in october 2003 , and during this run we obtained observations of nearby galaxy clusters .",
    "the second hectospec commissioning run was scheduled for april 2004 . in mid april",
    "2004 hectospec was placed into routine operation .",
    "hectochelle uses hectospec s robotic fiber positioner and optical fibers to feed a high dispersion bench spectrograph in place of hectospec s moderate dispersion spectrograph .",
    "single orders , or several overlapping orders , dispersed by hectochelle s echelle grating are selected with bandpass filters .",
    "@xcite describe hectochelle s design .",
    "hectospec s robotic fiber positioner is unique for its high fiber placement speed while retaining high positioning accuracy .",
    "the high speed robots meet their design goals reliably : 150 paired moves of the tandem robots in under 300 seconds , and with 25 @xmath1 m fiber positioning accuracy .",
    "the fiber robots attain this combination of high speed and accuracy due to a very stiff mechanical system that settles rapidly , powerful servo motors that rapidly accelerate the robots , and a sophisticated control system that incorporates many safety features while minimizing communication overhead between system components .",
    "hectospec s fiber geometry was first used by _ autofib _",
    "@xcite , an early robotic fiber - fed spectrograph for the anglo - australian telescope with a single cartesian robot positioning 64 optical fibers .",
    "hectospec s 300 fiber buttons are held onto the ( 400 series stainless ) steel focal surface with ndfeb magnets mounted in the bottom of the fiber button .",
    "the magnets provide  200 g of holding force normal to the focal surface and @xmath450 g of holding force in the plane of the focal surface .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a fiber button assembly from three angles . the 1.27 mm diameter stainless steel tube that protects the fiber after its exit from the fiber button",
    "is supported on its far end in brass pivot blocks .",
    "the fiber pivots are located 430 mm from the focal plane s center .",
    "the pivots are arranged in two vertical levels so that the fiber syringes are fed into two vertical levels of separator trays .",
    "using two levels provides more horizontal space in the separator trays and protects the syringes from excessive bending as the fiber button is moved tangentially on the focal surface .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the ( disassembled ) fiber pivots outside the edge of the focal surface .",
    "the fiber positioner can be separated into two parts to allow servicing of the robots and optical fibers .",
    "the upper unit ( figure [ fig3 ] ) contains the two six axis robots and most of the electronics .",
    "the lower unit ( figure [ fig4 ] ) contains the fiber probes , the fiber shelves ( to prevent tangling of the optical fibers ) , the three guider probes and their track , the intensified camera for the guider probes , and the fiber derotator assembly that allows the fibers to follow instrument rotation .",
    "the two units are separated by removing protective covers and then unbolting the upper end of the struts that connect the two assemblies .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] is a top view of the assembled upper and lower units .",
    "a pair of high - speed six - axis robots operating in tandem position hectospec s 300 optical fibers .",
    "each robot forms a three - axis cartesian ( xyz ) system that carries a fiber gripper assembly .",
    "the z - axis assembly ( figure [ fig6 ] ) contains nested gimbals to allow placement of the fiber buttons perpendicular to the curved focal surface , as well as the gripper mechanism .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the gripper assembly removed from the z axis assembly .",
    "the hectospec gripper design is based on the earlier hydra design @xcite .",
    "many mechanical details including parts lists are found in the hectospec hardware reference manual ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/mmti/hectospec.html ) .      the timing budget for completing a hectospec fiber repositioning consists of eight steps : ( 1 ) coordinated xy@xmath5 motion to the next button position , ( 2 ) z axis down , ( 3 ) gripper close , ( 4 ) z axis up , ( 5 ) coordinated xy@xmath5 motion to the new button position , ( 6 ) z axis down , ( 7 ) gripper open , and ( 8) z axis up .",
    "in total each fiber repositioning requires two coordinated xy@xmath5 motions , four z axis motions , and two gripper actuations .",
    "table [ tblmovet ] gives approximate times for these motions ; they total @xmath01.8 s.    a combination of factors set hectospec s internal positioning accuracy : ( 1 ) the accuracy of the servo loop closure , ( 2 ) the calibration of the axis encoders onto an orthogonal cartesian coordinate system ( includes axis home reference repeatability ) , ( 3 ) button movement as the gripper jaws are released , ( 4 ) the calibration of the fiber position within the button body , ( 5 ) flexure of the focal surface from zenith to the observing position , and ( 6 ) flexure in the guide probes over the course of an observation .",
    "hectospec s external positioning accuracy also includes contributions from astrometric errors for the targets and guide stars and instantaneous tracking errors . table [ poserr ] summarizes the measured and estimated magnitudes of the internal positioning error sources .",
    "we set a goal of 0.025 mm for the total internal positioning error ; table [ poserr ] shows that the error contributions sum to 0.015 mm in quadrature and 0.036 mm in a worst case straight sum .",
    "the actual total internal positioning error lies in between these estimates , or about 0.025 mm .",
    "the fiber positioning system has multiple levels of safety features built into the hardware and the instrument control software .",
    "our primary goal for these safety features is to prevent collisions between the robots , collisions of the robots with the focal surface or fibers on the focal surface , or high speed collisions of the robots into their mechanical limits of travel .",
    "additional safety features act to minimize the resulting damage if a collision occurs .",
    "a large number of lower level safety checks stop robot motion on the detection of an error condition that could result in damage to some part of the instrument .",
    "the pair of robots start each move segment simultaneously and they wait until both robots are finished before beginning the next move segment .",
    "( the eight move segments are listed in section 2.4 . )",
    "error conditions from either robot stop both robots . during the paired moves the closest approach of the robots is 150 mm for the entire fiber pick and place operation .",
    "limit switches that detect approaches of the robots closer than 150 mm or travel past the normal range of motion on all axes provide the next level of safety .",
    "energy absorbing bumpers on the x and y axes produce a controlled deceleration of the robots independent of the electronic and software systems once the limit switches are passed .",
    "the most difficult limit to detect is a downward movement of the z axis , because the appropriate limit position varies over the focal surface due to its curvature .",
    "we built z down limit switches into each of hectospec s three gripper jaws ; these switches are activated if the jaws strike the focal surface or a fiber button .",
    "the entire gripper mechanism is spring loaded ; the gripper mechanism retracts if the spring preload is exceeded .      a key safety feature built into most servo controllers , including the delta tau programmable multi axis controllers ( pmacs ) used for hectospec , is provided by the following error monitor .",
    "the following error is defined as the instantaneous difference between the commanded and actual positions read back from the encoder .",
    "the pmac servo controller can be programmed to begin a controlled deceleration when a preset following error is exceeded .",
    "each of hectospec s servo axes is protected by a following error limit .",
    "the following error protects against servo runaway if an encoder signal is lost and can provide safe shutdown if an obstruction is encountered .",
    "the following error provides no protection for moves shorter than the preset following error .",
    "an additional level of protection is provided for hectospec s powerful x and y axes : the signals from rotary encoders on the motor shaft and linear encoders on the axes are continously compared with custom code in the pmacs and the system is shut down if a small error is exceeded .",
    "other safety features include over - temperature sensing , a pmac cpu watchdog timer , amplifier fault detection , move time out protection , and a dropped button sensor , all of which terminate motion upon error detection .",
    "many levels of error checking are also built into hectospec s control software to prevent setting a fiber button down on top of another button , to prevent striking a fiber button or part of the positioner structure with the robots , or to move a fiber button beyond its safe travel limits .",
    "the major portion of hectospec s calibration was carried out with a custom grid of dots etched into an 0.61 m diameter astrosital disk by max levy corp .",
    "this calibration disk is the same diameter as hectospec s focal surface and is pinned and screwed into three support blocks in the guide probe tracks when in use .",
    "the grid is illuminated with high frequency fluorescent lamps carried on the robots , and the dot positions are recorded by the intensified cameras carried in the robot gripper assemblies . after averaging for 5 to 10 seconds , the noise in the dot position measurements is of order 2 @xmath1 m .",
    "the dot positions have an intrinsic positional accuracy better than 6 @xmath1 m .",
    "the positions of the dots recorded in the intensified robot cameras as the robots are commanded to move to the nominal dot position allows us to transform the xy encoder positions to an orthogonal cartesian system .",
    "the largest errors prior to calibration are @xmath040 @xmath1 m , a testament to the accuracy of hectospec s machining and to the quality of the axis rails .",
    "most of this error is due to : ( 1 ) small rotations of the robots as the gripper assembly moves along its rails and ( 2 ) the position of the encoders at the guide rails , 150 mm above the position of the fiber button in the gripper jaws ( and the position of the grid dots during calibration ) .",
    "the spacing of the guide blocks on the rails is also about 150 mm , so that deviations of the rail bed will map @xmath01:1 to deviations of the gripper jaws .",
    "this type of position sensing error is commonly termed abb@xmath6 error .",
    "the gimbal axes were calibrated using the robot intensified cameras and a fine pattern of dots etched into a smaller grid placed on the focal surface .",
    "the z axis scale is accurately determined by a rotary encoder and a precision ball screw driven through a 1:1 precision pulley system .",
    "a displacement measuring laser interferometer was used to verify that this scale is accurate to better than 1 @xmath1 m rms over the full range of travel .",
    "the ball screw accuracy is so high that we removed an unnecessary lvdt intended for z axis feedback .",
    "( a small slip of @xmath01 @xmath1 m upon each downward movement of the z - axis is removed by detecting a home sensor each time the z - axis is raised . ) the position of the focal surface relative to the robot axes was determined with a kaman noncontact displacement probe mounted to the gripper assembly .",
    "the robots were commanded to move across the focal surface in a grid pattern , and the position of the focal surface was determined at each point .      the main design challenge for hectospec s electronics was the distribution and routing of cables associated with the 15 motor axes and their associated encoders and limit switches .",
    "the weight and volume limits imposed by hectospec s cassegrain mounting location precluded mounting the majority of hectospec s electronics onboard .",
    "the relatively large power supplies , servo amplifiers , stepper motor drivers , cable distribution boxes , and signal and power conditioning components are located in remote racks .",
    "a total of 20 cables with @xmath0460 total conductors run between the fiber positioner and these racks , while 10 cables with @xmath0110 total conductors run between the bench spectrograph and the electronics racks . to maintain high reliablity in the signal path , heavy - duty mil - c circular connectors are used where cables must be disconnected to dismount the fiber positioner .",
    "the electronics rack contains seven main electronics boxes : ( 1 ) an interface box that accepts the mil - c cables from the fiber positioner and distributes the signals to internal rack cables , ( 2 ) an interface box that performs similar functions for the bench spectrograph cables , ( 3 ) a signal conditioning and interface box for the delta tau pmac servo controllers , ( 4 ) a pair of servo electronics boxes that contain the x , y , z,@xmath7,@xmath8 servo amplifiers as well as the gripper stepper motor driver , ( 5 ) a stepper motor drive bay for the guider probe and spectrograph stepper motors , ( 6 ) a power supply box , and ( 7 ) a power conditioning and distribution module .    on the fiber positioner",
    "there are four electronics boxes :",
    "( 1 ) the main interface box that accepts most of the mil - c cables and distributes signals and power to internal cables , ( 2 ) a smaller interface box that accepts the mil - c cables for the x , y , z servo motors , ( 3 ) an electronics box with a cpu and active circuits for on - board control functions , and ( 4 ) a small auxiliary box with an over - illumination sensor to protect the intensified cameras as well as power supplies for the fluorescent lamps used to illuminate the calibration grids .",
    "surge and over - voltage protection is provided in each of the main interface boxes at the fiber positioner , bench spectrograph , at the rack , as well as in the rack - mounted power conditioning box .",
    "further details can be found in the hectospec hardware reference manual ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/mmti/hectospec.html ) .",
    "the guider probes each move one section of a trifurcated coherent fiber bundle along an 86@xmath3 arc just outside the focal surface plate that supports the fiber probes at the mmt focus . @xcite",
    "describe the basic geometry of the guider probes .",
    "the guider probes are actuated along a curved rail by a stepper motor driving a pinion gear against a large - diameter fixed gear .",
    "the guider probe has a brake mechanism , released by a solenoid , to hold the probe in place after the guider probe is positioned with the telescope zenith pointing .",
    "the largest challenge with this mechanism was designing a brake mechanism that would grip firmly and that could be released with the limited force available from the solenoid .",
    "limited clearance from the structure precluded use of a large solenoid , and we reworked this mechanism twice to reduce the friction in the brake release mechanism . in future instruments pneumatic actuators might be a good replacement for solenoids because the pneumatic actuators offer a better power to weight ratio and do not dissipate as much heat .",
    "the hectospec fiber positioner is controlled by a motorola 142 vme single board computer running linux .",
    "this computer is mounted in the same vme rack that houses the two vme delta tau pmac servo controllers .",
    "the * hctserv * server program running on the motorola 142 accepts high and low level commands from clients and issues the appropriate motion control commands to the pmacs .",
    "normally , the fiber positioner is operated by sending a high level sequence command to move the fibers from one configuration to another .",
    "the sequence begins when the client program reads the current fiber configuration from the * hctserv * server which is stored in static memory .",
    "the client computes the sequence of fiber pick and place operations required to go from the current to the new configuration , and prepares a sequence table of paired pick and place moves for the two robots .",
    "the sequence table is sent to the * hctserv * server , which checks that the sequence table can execute without crossing fibers or colliding the robots .",
    "each paired move is successively loaded into the pmac and executed .",
    "a rack mounted intel - based pc running linux ,  snappy \" , contains three data translation dt3155 frame grabber boards that capture images from the two robot tv guiders and the three guider probes .",
    "snappy also communicates with the fiber positioner s internal electronic box through an rs-232 interface to control the gain of the intensified tv guider cameras , to control internal lamps , and to monitor motor temperatures . a guider server running on a remote computer acquires guide frames from snappy and calculates guide corrections for the telescope .",
    "@xcite describe the mechanical layout of hectospec ( see also @xcite ) and @xcite describe the optics mounts . here",
    "we describe the dewar assembly and rotary shutter not previously discussed in the literature .",
    "hectospec uses an internal focus catadioptric camera ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus there is a premium upon mimimizing the footprint of the ccd dewar support structure in the beam .",
    "the ccd dewar is an @xmath0100 mm diameter cylinder supported on a thin vertical foot and by a thin - section horizontal evacuated tube that surrounds the dewar s cold strap .",
    "the cold strap runs between the dewar and a liquid n@xmath9 cryostat mounted outside the optical beam running to and from the on - axis camera mirror .",
    "the dewar window also serves as a field flattener lens for the camera .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the dewar assembly .",
    "the dewar assembly is mounted on a focus stage .      at the spectrograph entrance  slit \" ,",
    "the optical fibers are arranged in two parallel columns spaced @xmath01.6 mm apart .",
    "the fibers in each column are spaced on 0.96 mm centers , but the two columns are offset by 0.48 mm , giving a final effective fiber to fiber spacing of 0.48 mm .",
    "the width of the structure holding the fibers , the  fiber shoe \" , has been minimized to reduce the obscuration of the beam returning past the fibers from the on - axis collimator mirror .",
    "a narrow rotary shutter assembly is mounted on the fiber shoe in front of the optical fibers .",
    "the rotating part of the shutter is an @xmath0150 mm long slotted cylinder .",
    "the shutter is toggled between open and closed with 90@xmath3 rotation actuated with a stepper motor .",
    "the rotary shutter assembly mounted on the fiber shoe is shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "hectospec uses two e2v model 42 - 90 4608@xmath102048 ccds with 13.5 @xmath1 m pixels , arranged in a 4608@xmath104096 array .",
    "the long axis of the ccds are parallel to dispersion .",
    "hectospec s ccds have superb cosmetic quality , and the entire two ccd array has only a single bad column . at a readout rate of 100,000 pixels s@xmath11 , the readout noise is 2.8 e@xmath12 rms . at the operating temperature of -120 @xmath3c ,",
    "the dark current is very low : 1 e@xmath12 in 900 s of integration .",
    "the electronics have a gain of 1 e@xmath12 adu@xmath11 , matching to a few percent between the four amplifiers . the count rate due to background radiation is 1 event s@xmath11 integrated over the region occupied by the fiber spectra on the two ccd array .",
    "hectospec shares its array controller electronics design with the other mmt f/5 optical and infrared instruments including hectochelle , megacam , and swirc .",
    "the design of these electronics was driven by the requirements of the 72 channel megacam version @xcite .",
    "hectospec s two ccds are read out through four amplifiers in 46 sec .",
    "@xcite and @xcite describe hectospec s optics ; here we describe the optical performance of the as - built spectrograph .",
    "hectospec s optics have a reduction of 3.45 , with an anamorphic demagnification ( in the spectral direction ) of 1.06 with the 270 groove mm@xmath11 grating . with perfect optics ,",
    "the image of the 250 @xmath1 m fiber should be an ellipse 5.4 by 5.1 pixels across .",
    "the rms image diameters produced by the real optics , when illuminated by a point source emitting into an f/5.3 cone , are 1.3 to 1.8 pixels .",
    "optical ray traces with zemax predict that the azimuthally averaged two dimensional fwhm of the fiber image should be 4.8 to 5.0 pixels , which agrees with the observed azimuthally averaged fwhm .",
    "the tails of the observed images are broader than the zemax prediction : the observed 95% encircled energy radius is 4.2 pixels compared with the predicted 3.5 pixels .",
    "we attribute this difference to small amounts of light emerging from the fibers at focal ratios faster than the modeled f/5.3 ; this light is imaged in the wings of the fiber image .",
    "we have a pupil mask at the grating to reject most of this focal ratio degraded light , but the mask is somewhat oversized to account for pupil rotation that depends on field angle .",
    "we discovered one general feature of the hires style of camera @xcite used in hectospec : a ghost pupil is formed between the focal surface and the field flattener element by light reflected from the ccd and then back again from the front surface of the field flattener .",
    "the intensity of this ghost pupil is reduced by a factor of @xmath010@xmath13 relative to the main image and the ghost pupil area is nearly as large as the detector area .",
    "we noticed the ghost pupil because we operated the spectrograph briefly with a damaged antireflection coating on the front surface of the field flattener .",
    "the reflectivity of the damaged antireflection coating was about an order of magnitude larger than normal , increasing the intensity of the ghost pupil by a corresponding factor .",
    "once we replaced the field flattener with a undamaged spare , the ghost pupil faded into obscurity , but it may be wise to keep an eye on this issue in designs of this family of optics .",
    "the initial optical coatings for the hectospec spectrograph were developed for the fast spectrograph @xcite at whipple observatory s 1.5 m tillinghast telescope .",
    "fast s high throughput sol - gel antireflection coatings and uv - enhanced overcoated silver reflection coatings gave many years of service and we expected the same performance in hectospec .",
    "hectospec s sol - gel antireflection coatings have been trouble free , but the first protected silver coatings on the hectospec mirrors were noticeably discolored by late 2002 , approximately three years after their coating .",
    "reflectivity measurements indicated low reflectivity between 5000 and 6000  .",
    "we decided to strip the original coatings and to recoat with the lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) durable silver reflective coating ( us patent 6,078,425 ) .",
    "the llnl coating has slightly lower peak reflectivity than the original ( fresh ) coating , but offers much better reflectivity below 4000  .",
    "hectospec s 259 mm collimated beam diameter requires large custom ruled gratings .",
    "hectospec currently has two gratings : a 270 groove mm@xmath11 grating blazed at 5000  and a 600 groove mm@xmath11 grating blazed at 6000  . in both cases",
    "we specified a 5000  blaze , but the blaze angle has proven to be the most difficult parameter to control in ruling these large gratings .",
    "the 6000  blaze for the 600 groove mm@xmath11 grating was the closest to specification achieved in four attempts .",
    "the 270 groove mm@xmath11 grating provides a dispersion of 1.2  pixel@xmath11 and a resolution of 6.2  fwhm .",
    "the 600 groove mm@xmath11 grating provides a dispersion of 0.5  pixel@xmath11 and a resolution of 2.6  fwhm .",
    "both gratings have a peak absolute efficiency of 72% .",
    "higher ruling density gratings might be best provided by assembling grating mosaics .",
    "the design of the optical fiber run between the fiber positioner and bench spectrograph turned out to be a much larger challenge than we had imagined during the hectospec s conceptual design phase .",
    "optical fibers offer a unique means of mapping a spectrograph slit efficiently onto a large number of objects distributed over a very large field of view .",
    "however , fibers must be used carefully if they are not to severely compromise the sensitivity of the spectrograph by degrading the focal ratio of the light incident on the fiber .",
    "degradation of the focal ratio in a fiber results in a loss of light in the spectrograph optics unless the spectrograph optics are significantly oversized .",
    "oversizing the optics is expensive in a spectrograph as large as hectospec s , and forming good images from the light scattered into faster focal ratios makes a difficult optical design problem harder .",
    "focal ratio degradation arises from mechanical stress of the fibers .",
    "focal ratio degradation will typically cause time variable throughput losses as the stress experienced by the fibers changes as the telescope pointing direction changes .",
    "these throughput variations are doubly troublesome because good sky subtraction relies on an accurate fiber to fiber throughput calibration .",
    "we were aware from the time that we began work on hectospec that the mounting details of the fibers in the fiber probes at the fiber positioner end and in the fiber slit at the spectrograph end of the fibers are important in controlling focal ratio degradation , but our test program demonstrated the importance of what happens in between .",
    "we engineered thermal breaks in the teflon tubing to address the thermal expansion mismatch between the fused silica fiber and the teflon tubes that protect the fibers .",
    "@xcite describe the basic design elements that we used to control focal ratio degradation in the fiber run .",
    "the other important design driver for the fiber run is that it must allow easy mounting and dismounting of the hectospec on the telescope .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the design of the fiber run and the position of the thermal breaks that allow for the differential thermal expansion of the fibers and their protective teflon tubes .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] is a closeup of one of the four thermal breaks in the fiber run .",
    "our specifications called for a total fiber throughput of 75% at 6000  into a focal ratio of f/5.3 , the final focal ratio of the spectroscopic wide field corrector and the design focal ratio of the hectospec bench spectrograph . at 6000  the internal absorption of hectospec s 26 m long fibers is 6% , the fresnel reflection loss at the uncoated bsm51y prisms at the fiber input end is 5.3% , and the fresnel loss at the bare fiber output end is 3.5% .",
    "the total throughput accounting for only these three fiber losses is 86% , requiring that 87% of the light entering the fibers at f/5.3 exit within an f/5.3 cone if the total throughput specification is to be met .",
    "as figure [ fig12 ] shows , we met our goal for total fiber throughput with an average throughput of 77% and a standard deviation of 2% .",
    "@xcite describe the basic algorithms used in hectospec observation planning to match fiber probes to targets . currently , each hectospec observer is responsible for planning the fiber configurations to be used at the telescope .",
    "the observer begins by assembling a catalog containing the desired targets as well as potential guide stars in the field .",
    "observers may priority rank targets in the catalog and assign a minimum and maximum number of fibers to each rank .",
    "the guide stars and the targets must have excellent relative astrometry because the guide stars establish the field alignment .",
    "the observer uses the * xfitfibs * program to create instrument configuration files from the input catalog . *",
    "xfitfibs * combines the observation planning software with a graphical user interface ( gui ) .",
    "the observer may use * xfitfibs * to plan multiple fiber configurations with multiple field centers and to rank these centers in priority .",
    "in addition to matching fibers to targets , * xfitfibs * selects guide stars , and assigns fibers for the measurement of the sky background .",
    "the user can drag field centers with a mouse or enter new field centers into a table and view the effects on a graphical display .",
    "the display indicates guide stars within range of the guide probes as well as those accessible by changing the instrument rotator angle .",
    "the * xfitfibs * software derives guide star magnitudes from either the 2mass or gsc2 catalogs , removes stars outside the specified magnitude range , and aditionally removes non - stellar objects using gsc2 classifications or by sextractor classification from dss images .",
    "stars with close companions or brighter neighbors in the field of the guide probes are also excluded .",
    "selection of bright guide stars ( r@xmath1416 ) minimizes setup time with the intensified robot and guide cameras and allows operation in the full moon .",
    "hectospec is operated in queue mode to use valuable telescope time efficiently and to distribute the time lost due to weather , telescope and instrument malfunctions evenly .",
    "the goal of the queue scheduling is to distribute the available productive observing time proportionally to the nights scheduled by the time allocation committees .",
    "the mmt is scheduled in trimesters , and the queue scheduling is for a single trimester at a time . the queue schedule must be continually updated through an observing run in response to the weather conditions and telescope / instrument performance .",
    "the observers provide the queue manager with completed fiber configurations , which include the sequence of observations , the fiber layout , and valid guide stars .",

    "the fiber positioner is operated by experienced robot operators on behalf of the queue .",
    "the robot operator also oversees the acquisition of calibration data in the late afternoon and early evening including henear wavelength calibrations , incandescent lamps for flatfielding , and typically twilight sky flatfield exposures . during the night",
    ", observers assigned telescope time operate the spectrograph and evaluate the data quality on behalf of the queue .",
    "observers thereby gain firsthand experience with hectospec s operation and capabilities , avoiding some of the communication difficulties that others have reported in the operation of observing queues isolated from the scientist who will ultimately use the data .",
    "* hobserve * ( figure [ fig13 ] ) is a tcl / tk script that provides a step by step procedural interface that guides the robot operator through the procedure of calculating the appropriate fiber configuration for the chosen observing time , calculating the sequence of fiber moves required to attain that configuration , issuing the move commands to the robots , and setting up the guiding on the field with the preselected guide stars . a separate graphical user interface ( gui ) ( * guidegui * ( figure [ fig14 ] ) displays the guide star images superposed on the guider target positions .",
    "the * hobserve * script coordinates the actions of several servers and calls other high level shell scripts to accomplish its functions .",
    "the * spice * tcl / tk program ( figure [ fig15 ] ) provides a gui interface to the spectrograph and camera controls and sequences the operations for various types of exposures .",
    "the gui consists of two fixed displays at the top of the window along with several tab selectable displays that appear at the bottom of the window .",
    "the upper fixed display indicates the status of the system power controls and of the software servers that control hardware components .",
    "the text message within the status buttons and the color of the status buttons change together to indicate the instrument state .",
    "toggling these buttons toggles the state of the power or software server .",
    "the lower fixed display provides housekeeping information as well as exposure status .",
    "the housekeeping items include the dewar temperature , the status of the calibration lamps , the tracking status of the adc prisms , and the position of the wave front sensor carriage .",
    "the exposure status information includes the current exposure count within the requested number of exposures , the current exposure type ( skyflat , object , bias , dark , etc . ) , and the current exposure state ( exposing , reading out , etc . ) .",
    "the observer can select one of four user - selectable tabbed displays : an initialization tool , a standard operations tool , a calibration lamp tool , and an observing log tool .",
    "the initialization tool controls the sequencing of powering up and homing the three spectrograph axes ( shutter , focus , and grating stage ) , as well as bringing up the required software servers .",
    "the standard operations tool is the main tabbed display window that the observer uses to acquire data and control the spectrograph . within this window",
    "the grating rotation , focus position , and shutter status are displayed and can be controlled .",
    "the current fiber configuration file name is displayed , but the fiber configuration is controlled from the * hobserve * interface .",
    "the observer selects the desired exposure type from a pull - down menu ( object , dark , bias , domeflat , henear , focus , etc . ) and specifies the desired exposure time and number of exposures . pressing  go \" initiates the exposure sequence . during the initialization of the exposure , the software checks for possible problems including a mismatch between the requested and encoded grating rotation and focus position , blocking by the wavefront sensor , illumination of calibration lamps at inappropriate times , lack of guiding signals , and adc prism tracking turned off .",
    "the focus procedure automatically moves the grating to the zero order position and takes a sequence of ccd charge - shifted exposures at different focus settings .",
    "the grating is returned to its nominal position at the end of the focus run .",
    "focus changes during a run appear to be negligible .",
    "the calibration lamp tool allows the observer to control the calibration lamps that illuminate a screen mounted on the mmt building shutters .",
    "the calibration lamps are mounted in four identical lamp boxes mounted in the mmt chamber .",
    "lamp status , lamp voltages , and lamps currents are displayed in a comprehensive color - coded table .",
    "the observing log tool provides a summary of each of the exposures in the selected night s directory and a text box for the observer to annotate each exposure . a postscript formatted observing log of all the exposures ( with observer comments ) for the current night is produced and archived .      at the beginning of the night or during an exposure on the previous field ,",
    "the robot operator loads in the next fiber configuration in the  on - deck \" window of * hobserve*. the expected start time and exposure duration of the observation are entered , and the fiber positions are retweaked for the airmass and instrument rotator position at the expected exposure midpoint . depending on the nominal position angle entered during observation planning , the rotator demand angles may exceed the @xmath1590@xmath3 soft limits .",
    "therefore , the position angle can be reset by the robot operator to minimize the rotator demand angles .",
    "if guide stars are available in two of the three guide star probes , the  on - deck \" configuration is ready to go .",
    "if two guide stars are not available at this position angle , the position angle can be manually adjusted to find minimum rotator demand angles consistent with obtaining two guide stars . in the worst case ,",
    "if two guide stars are not available at acceptable rotator angles , another configuration can be chosen without loss of observing time .",
    "we begin the reconfiguration process by slewing the telescope to the zenith .",
    "the robots are capable of operating at any combination of zenith angle and rotator angle , but we reconfigure the fibers with the telescope zenith pointing to minimize the power dissipation and load on the drive components . after the robots reposition the fibers , the guide probes are moved to correct guide star positions . the telescope is then slewed to a bright star near the field position , and the wave front sensor is deployed to correct the primary support forces and telescope collimation .",
    "while the wave front sensor probe is retracted , the telescope is slewed to the field position and the instrument rotator is set to track the desired position angle .",
    "the robot guide cameras are sent to the guide star positions and the telescope pointing and the rotator angle are adjusted with autoguiding software until the guide stars appear at the positions corresponding to a fiber held in the gripper jaws .",
    "a pellicle beam splitter in the robot optical train allows 50% of the light to pass through to the guide probes .",
    "the positions of the guide stars in the guide probes are captured and the guiding is then transferred to the guide probes .",
    "this procedure directly ties the guiding to the robot - defined coordinate system upon which the fibers are positioned .",
    "as soon as the robots are parked an observation can begin .",
    "we measured the throughput of hectospec with the spectrophotometric standard star bd+284211 , stepping the star across one of hectospec s fibers to determine the point of maximum throughput to eliminate light loss due to astrometric errors . with a direct spectrograph ,",
    "the entrance aperture is normally opened as wide as possible to separate the measurement of spectrograph throughput from aperture losses . with fibers ,",
    "the entrance aperture is fixed and we measure total throughput including aperture losses .",
    "figure [ fig16 ] shows the derived throughput measurement for bd+284211 in 1@xmath2 fwhm seeing .",
    "we have separately calculated the aperture losses for hectospec s 1.5@xmath2 diameter fibers as a function of seeing using images obtained with megacam ; in 1@xmath2 fwhm seeing we find that a 1.5@xmath2 diameter contains 59% of the light , giving an aperture correction of 1.7 .",
    "referring to figure [ fig16 ] and applying this correction , the system throughput peaks at @xmath017% between 5000 and 6000  .",
    "our prediction for the total system throughput peaked at 20% in the same wavelength region , in reasonable agreement with the measurement .",
    "the room that encloses the hectospec and hectochelle bench spectrographs is one level above the telescope chamber floor , and shares a common wall with the telescope chamber .",
    "the spectrograph room is not well insulated from the telescope chamber due to several doors and perforations . as a result ,",
    "the temperature in the spectrograph room fluctuates considerably more than we had planned .",
    "the nightly temperature swings lead to temperature gradients in the optical bench and optical mounts that lead to thermally - induced image motion with a maximum excursion of one pixel in both the spatial and spectral directions during the course of a night .",
    "larger shifts of a few pixels occur over the course of an observing run .",
    "as discussed in section 7.2 , the shifts during a night are easily corrected by tracing the positions of the fiber spectra and by tracking the positions of night sky emission lines . during august 2005",
    ", we will replace the coated black cloth currently enclosing the bench spectrographs to prevent light leaks with light - tight insulated panels .",
    "this replacement will remove a potential fire hazard from the light - tight but flammable cloth and improve the thermal insulation in the spectrograph room .",
    "our finite element models of hectospec predicted that the hectospec s focal plane assembly ( onto which the fibers are attached ) would shift by @xmath050 @xmath1 m relative to the robot s gripper assembly as the telescope pointing changes from zenith to an elevation angle of 30@xmath3 .",
    "this flexure is relevant because we use the robots to establish the correct position of the guide stars in the guider probes .",
    "we took advantage of a cloudy night to measure this flexure by placing the fibers on the focal surface at the zenith in the usual fashion , tipping the telescope in elevation , and measuring the position of the backlit fibers .",
    "the average deflections that we measured moving from an elevation angle of 90@xmath3 to an elevation angle of 30@xmath3 are 40 @xmath1 m in one robot and 42 @xmath1 m in the other",
    ". we also noticed that rotating the instrument rotator produces repeatable deflections of up to 25 @xmath1 m if the elevation angle is held constant .",
    "rotator - induced deflections were anticipated , and set stringent requirements on the accuracy of the rotator bearing .",
    "the elapsed time between completing an exposure on one field and beginning another is  1040 s. table [ overhead ] lists the items that contribute to the observing overhead .",
    "the observing overhead will drop slightly with increased automation of the wave front sensing procedure , but is unlikely to drop much below 900 s.      hectospec has proven to be reliable at the telescope despite its complexity .",
    "we have lost @xmath04 nights of observing time in hectospec s first year of operation due to instrument malfunctions . the most serious incident occurred in july 2004 .",
    "a backlash removal spring in the gripper mechanism failed , and the gripper misplaced a button . during the diagnosis and recovery process ,",
    "a series of low level robot commands were issued and the robots were inadvertantly parked with a fiber caught in the gripper jaws .",
    "this event resulted in the spectacular destruction of the captured optical fiber .",
    "the damaged fiber was replaced with a spare fiber from one of the five spare groups of fibers , and the antibacklash springs in both grippers were replaced with longer springs of the same spring constant .",
    "our analysis revealed that the original spring was repeatedly overstressed in normal operation .",
    "we have also revised our procedures to require visual inspection of the hectospec focal plane and fiber positions before executing low level robot commands .",
    "two of the other hectospec malfunctions involved the guide probes . during the first incident , the guider probe braking mechanism on one of the probes stuck open , causing the guide probes to fall out of position as the telescope",
    "was slewed away from the zenith .",
    "the problem was traced to excessive friction on the brake guide shafts which was removed by polishing the shafts on all three guider probes .",
    "the second incident was caused by the guider brake failing to release on one of the guider probes .",
    "this problem was traced to a loose connector , which was possibly not fully seated following the brake shaft rework .",
    "the @xmath05000 spectra produced nightly by the hectospec are reduced using a semi - automated pipeline ; typically this reduction is completed by the afternoon following the observations .",
    "the reduction yields a catalog of redshifts , errors , signal to noise estimates and crude spectral types in time to modify the next nights observing plans , if necessary . @xcite",
    "give an overview of the entire data flow , from forming the observing catalog to archiving and releasing the final reduced spectra .",
    "here we describe those steps taken to reduce the raw ccd frames into a set of wavelength calibrated spectra with redshifts .",
    "the system rests on the iraf spectral reduction packages @xcite and the iraf task * dofibers * @xcite .",
    "the process is controlled by a set of custom iraf cl scripts , similar to those which control the reduction of data from the fast spectrograph @xcite .",
    "accurate wavelength calibrations are crucial to the performance of fiber spectrographs on large aperture telescopes .",
    "small wavelength calibration errors cause artifacts in the subtraction of the near infra - red oh night sky lines which mask or mimic the appearance of h@xmath16 emission at @xmath17 . in a one hour exposure hectospec",
    "is routinely able to measure spectra for galaxies with central i band surface brightnesses 10% of the night sky brightness .",
    "our basic wavelength calibration procedure consists of fitting the centers of emission lines produced by our fe - cathode near hollow cathode lamp with a low order polynomial , once for each fiber , following the standard procedures in * dofibers*. typical scatter about these fits is 0.06  , consistent with the error in determining individual line centers . a single set of ( typically )",
    "five calibration exposures is taken in the late afternoon , with eight near lamps illuminating panels on the mmt s building shutters .    the next step in the procedure corrects for thermally induced spectral shifts .",
    "purely linear image shifts can be removed easily .",
    "figure [ weekshift ] shows the image motion in the dispersion direction for a typical week of observing in april 2005 .",
    "these shifts are obtained by cross correlating a 1000  wide image section centered near the @xmath188399 night sky line taken from the first on - sky ccd frame taken each night ; thus the drift shown in figure [ weekshift ] is reset to zero each night .",
    "typical nightly image motion is less than one pixel .",
    "the image motions in the direction perpendicular to the dispersion show similar patterns and extents ; the two components of motion are not strongly correlated .",
    "any non - linear shifts would appear to first order as stretches or rotations .",
    "figure [ weekstretch ] shows the differences in the shift as measured by cross correlation of image segments centered around @xmath188399  and around @xmath185577  for the same week in april 2005 shown in figure [ weekshift ] .",
    "notice that the y axis scale has been expanded by a factor of five .",
    "the results are consistent with zero distortion within the measurement error of 0.02 pixels .",
    "a similar analysis shows that image rotations are also consistent with zero .",
    "a systematic change in the image scale of one part in 100,000 over twelve hours would result in a change in the measured distance of 0.02 pixels between @xmath188399 and @xmath185577 .",
    "this is the level of the scatter in figure [ weekstretch ] , and represents a lower limit on the image stability .    while the shifts measured by direct image correlation could put all on - sky images onto the same system before the extraction of the 1-d spectra",
    ", this procedure would not solve the problem of putting the on - sky images onto the same system as the nearfe calibration spectra .",
    "we choose to make the correction after the ( curved ) 1-d spectra have been extracted , but before they are rebinned into wavelength space . compared with shifting before extracting this correction induces an error which is proportional to the sine of the difference in the angle of curvature of the spectra between the nearfe spectrum and the on - sky spectrum , at each fixed pixel position . for image shifts of @xmath0one pixel , even for the most highly curved spectra",
    ", this error is negligible compared with the other sources of error .",
    "we use the standard * apextract * techniques , determining the shift perpendicular to the dispersion direction by image correlation with the flat field image ( which must be taken at nearly the same time as the nearfe calibrations ) . after extracting the 300 spectra from the image",
    "we simply measure the centroid of the @xmath185577 night sky line , in pixel space , and calculate ( for each spectrum ) the shift , in pixels between that position and its expected position , as determined from the ( 300 ) near solutions .",
    "we assign the median shift to be the shift in the dispersion direction for the entire image , and modify the wavelength polynomials accordingly .",
    "finally , we rebin the spectra into equal wavelength pixels .",
    "figure [ 5577 ] shows the pixel shifts for each spectrum on the night of 10 april 2005 , which is broadly typical .",
    "each point represents one spectrum , and each set of 300 points represents one ccd frame .",
    "the spectra from each frame are plotted in order , the time between frames is not shown , but can be seen in figure [ weekshift ] ( the night in figure [ 5577 ] is the second night from the right ) .",
    "three things are apparent in figure [ 5577 ] .",
    "( 1 ) the shifts in the position of @xmath185577 are large when compared with other effects .",
    "( 2 ) the shifts change smoothly , but with occasional discontinuities resulting from * apextract s * choice of zeropoint .",
    "the discontinuities demonstrate clearly that the shifts must be corrected before spectra may be combined .",
    "( 3 ) finally , each set of 300 spectra , from a single frame , shows small , systematic differences in the shift as a function of position in the frame .",
    "the amplitude of this shift , from top to bottom , is similar to the scatter in the measurement of a single line center .",
    "the origin of this shift is unknown , but it is not due to systematic errors in the wavelength polynomial .",
    "we currently do not correct for this small effect .",
    "figure [ 8399 ] shows the final measured positions for the @xmath188399  night sky line after the spectra from figure [ 5577 ] have been wavelength calibrated and rebinned into 1- - wide equal wavelength bins .",
    "the scatter about the expected value is 0.092  , which includes the small systematic errors seen in figure [ 5577 ] .",
    "the offset of 0.075  is approximately constant throughout the night , and may be attributed to errors in the calibration polynomial as there is no apparent drift .",
    "the removal of the night sky spectrum from observations of faint objects made with fiber optic spectrographs has long been viewed as problematic ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently methods have been developed which fit local variations from the mean sky due to changes in fiber transmission , focus , etc . by means of eigenvector techniques @xcite , and b - splines @xcite .",
    "the stability of hectospec s bench spectrograph allows us to reach near poisson limited sky subtraction without having to resort to the use of eigenvectors or b - splines .",
    "typically 30 hectospec fibers ( 10% of the total ) are allocated to blank sky observations .",
    "we reduce the data for each of the two ccd chips separately because combining sky spectra from the two chips degrades performance .",
    "the point spread functions of the two ccds differ by @xmath00.2 pixels fwhm , apparently due to differences in the ccd charge diffusion .",
    "we check for objects contaminating the sky spectra in two ways .",
    "( 1 ) we divide each sky spectrum by the mean of all the sky spectra .",
    "when the rms pixel value exceeds a threshold the sky spectrum is considered contaminated , and is rejected .",
    "( 2 ) we subtract the ( revised ) mean sky spectrum from each remaining sky spectrum , then correlate the residuals against our absorption and emission line galaxy templates ; spectra which yield significant redshifts ( significance is determined by the @xcite @xmath19 statistic ) are contaminated by galaxian or stellar light , and are rejected . for a typical sample , taken in march and april 2005 , 181 of 972 sky spectra ( @xmath019% )",
    "were found to be contaminated by this test .",
    "we subtract the sky from each object spectrum by averaging the six closest ( clean ) sky spectra .",
    "we rescale this average so that the flux in the oh 8399  line matches the flux in the object spectrum , and then simply subtract the rescaled sky spectrum from the object spectrum . for galaxies with r@xmath020",
    "this procedure works very well .",
    "we test the limits of the technique by applying it to the measurement of substantially fainter spectra .",
    "we chose 222 objects from a deep galaxy survey @xcite that were evenly distributed in @xmath20 color between @xmath21 .",
    "one third were evenly divided in bright magnitude @xmath22 and two thirds were evenly divided in faint magnitude @xmath23 ; figure [ magcolor ] shows the distribution of objects .",
    "these objects were observed in two different hectospec configurations before and after transit .",
    "the first observation had 160 minutes exposure and the second 120 minutes exposure .",
    "the two data sets were reduced separately , then summed to provide the final spectra .",
    "we obtained reliable redshifts for 137 of these objects ; the remainder had insufficient signal to noise to obtain redshifts .",
    "the solid dots in figure [ magcolor ] show the galaxies with redshifts ; they tend to be brighter and bluer .",
    "figure [ successrat ] shows the success rate as a function of the 1.5@xmath24 diameter aperture magnitude , which corresponds to the light down the fiber .",
    "the success rate falls rapidly for objects fainter then r@xmath25=23.0 ; essentially all of the lower central surface brightness objects with reliable redshifts are emission line objects .",
    "figure [ deepsky ] shows a 280 minute exposure spectrum of a galaxy at z=0.71 having with r=22.0 and r@xmath25=22.97 prior to sky subtraction .",
    "figure [ deepobj ] shows the spectrum after sky subtraction and after application of an 8   smoothing window .",
    "the caii k line for this galaxy is detected in absorption at @xmath01.5 @xmath26 significance .",
    "there are about 450 independant 10 pixel wide regions in this spectrum , we would expect about 30 of these to have positive fluctuations greater than the size of the k line , and 30 to have negative fluctuations .",
    "this behavior is approximately what we see in this spectrum , taking into account that the intensity of the sky radiation ( and thus the size of the statistical fluctuations ) is in some places substantially higher than at the location of the k line .",
    "the coincidence of several features allows a reliable redshift to be determined in this case , but the existence of many similar sized noise spikes suggests that the spectrum of this r@xmath022 galaxy is near the limit .",
    "were this object at z=1.0 the light entering the fiber would be reduced by half and the spectral lines would be redshifted into the oh night sky line forest . with perfect sky subtraction",
    "the k line would be about a 0.3 @xmath26 effect ; redshift determinations are impossible at these levels . while in theory substantially longer exposures could be made to measure higher redshift objects , in practice it makes more sense to use higher resolution to isolate the night sky features @xcite .",
    "a 600 line grating blazed in the red for the hectospec will see first light during the second half of 2005 .",
    "hectospec is frequently used to observe objects with @xmath27 with exposures of 30 to 120 minutes .",
    "often observations are made with partial moon .",
    "figures [ typabs ] and [ typem ] show representative 60 minute exposures , taken with the moon up , six days past the new moon .",
    "redshifts are determined using the methods described by @xcite , hereafter km98 .",
    "new templates , using objects with z@xmath00.3 were created for the correlation analysis , as described in km98 .",
    "figure [ isovsr ] shows the relation between isophotal r magnitude and the @xcite @xmath19 statistic , a measure of redshift quality , for 1455 absorption line galaxies observed with one hour exposures ( some with moon ) in march and april 2005 as part of the gravitational lensing survey @xcite .",
    "all these spectra yielded reliable redshifts .",
    "there is little correlation between the magnitude and the quality of the redshift .",
    "figure [ apervsr ] shows the same 1455 absorption line galaxies , but with the 1.5@xmath28 aperture magnitude , which represents the light down the fiber , vs. the @xmath19 statistic .",
    "as expected there is now a strong correlation .",
    "hopkins r band dark sky brightness is typically 20.0 in a 1.5@xmath28 aperture .",
    "the hectospec routinely obtains absorption line redshifts for objects at 20%  of the sky in one hour exposures .",
    "following km98 we use 332 objects with duplicate spectra to estimate the error in a redshift measurement as a function of the @xmath19 statistic .",
    "we find that the median velocity error for absorption line redshifts can described by @xmath29 km s@xmath11 while the emission line redshift errors can be described by @xmath30 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the mean errors are about twice these , and are well represented by the normal * xcsao * error estimator ( km98 ) .",
    "hectospec is a powerful , wide - field spectrograph that makes excellent use of the converted mmt s 1@xmath3 diameter and 6.5 meter aperture .",
    "it reaches to r=21.5 with ease , and the sky subtraction with standard data reduction allows quality spectroscopy to r=22 with sufficient exposure .",
    "fiber spectrographs have an unjustified reputation in some quarters for compromised throughput that is probably due to design shortcomings in the fiber run between the focal plane and the spectrograph and in the design of bench spectrographs .",
    "hectospec s peak system throughput of 10% including aperture losses , and 17% correcting for aperture losses , is quite competitive with slit spectrographs when its huge multiplex advantage is taken into account .",
    "a high - throughput long - slit spectrograph like the fast spectrograph on the whipple observatory s 1.5 m tillinghast reflector @xcite has a peak system throughput ( correcting for aperture losses by using a wide slit ) that reaches 30% with fresh mirror and corrector coatings , but is more typically @xmath025% in average conditions .",
    "hectospec is a popular instrument at the mmt .",
    "users respond favorably to the flexibility and efficiency of the queue observing mode .",
    "we designed hectospec to rapidly survey normal intermediate redshift galaxies and high redshift active galaxies identified through by space x - ray and infrared observatories , and these are active areas of research with hectospec .",
    "a wide variety of other programs are underway , including several stellar programs .",
    "because hectospec can offer effective sky subtraction to r@xmath022 , essentially limited by poisson noise , it is a surprisingly versatile general - purpose spectrograph .",
    "we are in the process of building a complementary optical imaging spectrograph for the mmt ( binospec , @xcite ) .",
    "a wide - field imaging spectrograph will allow us to efficiently survey galaxy dynamics at intermediate redshifts and will offer very high throughput ( potentially twice hectospec s ) and even more precise sky subtraction for very faint objects .",
    "however , binospec s advantages come at a price : its field of view is only 8% of hectospec s , and with likely slitlet lengths of 10@xmath2 to 12@xmath2 , binospec will offer @xmath050% of hectospec s multiplex advantage .",
