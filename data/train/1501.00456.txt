    "from the current experimental evidence of neutrino oscillations  @xcite , we know that neutrinos are massive particles , and each neutrino flavor eigenstate @xmath5 is a coherent superposition of mass eingenstates @xmath6 , connected by the pmns mixing matrix @xmath7 , through the relation @xmath8 .",
    "however , oscillation experiments are sensitive only to the mass squared differences ( @xmath9 ) and not on the absolute value of each mass eigenstate which is one of the most challenging measurement in particle physics",
    ". furthermore , one must be careful about the interpretation of experiments on neutrino masses since different techniques result in different observables .",
    "for instance , neutrino - less double beta decay experiments search for majorana neutrinos with mass @xmath10 and single-@xmath11 decay experiments observe features driven by massive neutrinos with @xmath12 not dependent on majorana phases . since @xmath13 measurements which are not exclusively sensitive to majorana neutrinos can be safely taken as conservative ones  @xcite .",
    "if we can measure the mass of any neutrino flavor @xmath14 the masses of @xmath15 can be obtained from the boundaries of the mixing matrix and other @xmath16 obtained from different oscillation experiments .    the strongest experimental limit in the neutrino mass , as quoted in the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , was obtained by the troitsk experiment on tritium single-@xmath11 decay : @xmath17  2.05  ev at 95% confidence level ( c.l )  @xcite .",
    "this kind of experiment measures the modification of the @xmath11 spectrum near its endpoint caused by the neutrino mass .",
    "the katrin experiment  @xcite will improve the technique and plan to set a stronger limit by enhancing the sensitivity at least in one order of magnitude .",
    "neutrinos emitted from stellar collapse , for example type ii supernovae , can give a valuable contribution to the determination of the mass of neutrinos , as idealized by zatsepin  @xcite .",
    "using neutrino data  @xcite from the sn1987a , which exploded in the large magellanic cloud ( @xmath1850  kpc ) , and the likelihood of detection analysis proposed in  @xcite , an upper bound of 5.8  ev at 95% c.l  @xcite was obtained . with a different likelihood approach and astrophysical parametrization of the neutrino emission , lamb & loredo  @xcite",

    "we are going to consider electronic neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) emitted from the neutronization burst of a galactic supernova at a distance of 10  kpc and 15  m@xmath1 and detected by a liquid argon time projection chamber ( lartpc ) .",

    "[ sn ] presents the main assumptions about electronic neutrino production and its propagation ; sec .",
    "[ detec ] presents the basic features about the neutrino detection in the lartpc ; sec .",

    "as the shock evolves against the infalling dense matter of the outer core of the star , some of its energy is lost by the photodissociation of nuclei into protons and neutrons . at this moment , there is an abundant production of electronic neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) via @xmath19 .",
    "these electronic neutrinos accumulate in a very dense and opaque environment behind the shock wave .",
    "when the shock reaches the zone with densities around @xmath20 g @xmath21 in a few miliseconds after the bounce the @xmath0 s are released .",
    "this process is called neutronization burst .",
    "it has a peak luminosity of @xmath22  erg s@xmath23 and lasts @xmath24  miliseconds .",
    "for a recent review of the current knowledge and status of the explosion mechanism , see  @xcite .    at a distance @xmath25 of the progenitor star , for each flavor @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "the unoscillated sprectral number fluxes ( @xmath28 ) are : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the luminosity for the respective flavor @xmath14 , @xmath31 is the @xmath14 mean energy and @xmath32 is the quasi - thermal spectrum written as follows  @xcite : @xmath33 the @xmath34 is a parameter defined by @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the normalization constant factor : @xmath37 .",

    "( [ delay1 ] ) is represented by @xmath58 and can be written as : @xmath59",
    "the neutrino flux of the neutronization burst is mainly populated by electronic neutrinos .",
    "therefore , only experimental technniques with high sensitivity to @xmath0 can have a possibility to investigate this particular phase of supernova explosion .",
    "the liquid argon time projection chamber ( lartpc ) , such as the icarus - like detectors  @xcite , have all the features required to identify the neutronization burst .",
    "the `` long baseline neutrino experiment '' ( lbne )  @xcite foresees a 34  kton ( fidutial volume ) lartpc as its far detector .",
    "the experiment is dedicated for determination of cp violation phase and neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "though , its dimensions and underground site are suitable for exploring rare events , such as neutrinos from supernovae and proton decay .",
    "this experimental design is taken into account for our calculations .",
    "the most favourable electronic neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) detection channel in lartpcs is the charged current ( cc ) interaction : @xmath60 .",
    "there are other detection channels , but all of them with smaller cross section .",
    "these detection channels can be tagged by spectral analysis of the photon emission from de - excitation of @xmath61 , @xmath62 or @xmath63 , which exhibit specific spectral lines .",
    "the @xmath64 cross sections can be found in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "the number of expected events in the detector can be evaluated in the following way : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath67 cc cross section , @xmath68 is the number of targets in the 34  kton argon detector and @xmath69 is the oscillated neutrino flux , which is evaluated by eqs .",
    "( [ eq4]-[eq8 ] ) .",
    "we performed a monte carlo simulation ( mc ) with very optimistic assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , all of our assumptions have solid grounds and can be taken as a `` realistic case '' .",
    "the number of expected events depends on the considerations we make about the neutrino production and their propagation till the detector .",
    "we considered a comprehensive knowledge of the astrophysical process related to the sn explosion , which means that the astrophysical parameters related to neutrino production , ie the neutrino fluxes , are well known .",
    "however , to introduce uncertainties related to the explosion mechanism , we considered a 5% error in the overall normalization of the evaluated counting rates . concerning the sn distance , we assumed a galactic sn of 10  kpc .",
    "the detector configuration , as pointed out before , is 34  kton lartpc with 80% of efficiency for @xmath0 charged current ( cc ) detection . for now , background effects have been disconsidered since the detector is assumed to be placed underground . in this situation",
    "we expect a suppression of seven orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 energy threshold for detection was set to 5  mev . for the energy resolution we used a parametrization given by : @xmath70  @xcite . for the time resolution",
    ", we adopted a @xmath7120  @xmath72 flat distribution .",
    "also , we stress the fact that we performed our mc ignoring aditional complications given by the lack of knowledge if the first detected event is syncronized or not with the beginning of the burst . in the mc we included the two possible scenarions for mass hierarchy , as mentioned in sec .",

    ".upper bounds on @xmath57(ev ) considering a supernova at 10  kpc and a liquid argon detector with 34  kton .",
    "we show the results for normal hierarchy ( nh ) and the numbers inside the parentheses are the mass evaluation for inverted hierarchy ( ih ) .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "from table  [ tabresumonh ] we notice that , despite we change the configuration of the detector , statistical fluctuation of the monte carlo simulation plays a fundamental role in the mass bound determination , since we have few events in the neutronization burst and this process lasts only @xmath93  25  ms .",
    "a very good example of this kind of behaviour is the one shown in the ih curve of fig .",
    "[ mc ] ( red dashed ) . in the interval of 35 - 40",
    "ms , there is a peak that was not theoreticaly predicted .",
    "so , this generates a worse @xmath74 and an interval in the neutrino mass bound ( 0.18 - 1.70  ev ) with a @xmath92 at 1.00  ev .",
    "another example of the impact of this statistical fluctuation is that , for the nh case , we have obtained a more stringent bound in the `` realistic '' case compared to the `` perfect '' case .",
    "our bound , at 95% c.l , for the nh is very similar to the one obtained by the troitsk experiment of tritium @xmath11 decay .",
    "so , if we really have nh and comparing with terrestrial experiments , which are independent of mass hierarchy , like katrin ( @xmath94  ev ) , it will be very difficult that lbne will put a more stringent limit on neutrino mass . from the planck cosmic microwave background measurements and",
    "galaxy clustering information from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , part of the sloan digital sky survey - iii , and assuming a @xmath95cdm cosmological model , ref .",
    "@xcite obtained , at 95% c.l , @xmath96  ev . ref .",
    "@xcite obtained that @xmath97  ev , when one takes into account observations of the large - scale matter power spectrum from the wigglez dark energy survey , planck sattelite and baryon acoustic oscillation . if we consider that mass eigenstates are degenerated , @xmath98  ev  @xcite and @xmath99  ev  @xcite .    for the nh and ih case , our bounds , respectively , at 95% c.l , are @xmath2  ev and @xmath3  ev .",
    "these bounds are almost similar with other prospects of neutrino mass bounds obtained for sn neutrinos . just for comparison ,",
    "authors in  @xcite considering only normal hierarchy , using a 20  kton liquid scintillator at jiangmen underground neutrino observatory ( juno ) and a galatic supernova @xmath100 signal obtained a limit on the absolute neutrino mass scale : @xmath101  ev at 95% c.l .",
    "this limit is also similar with the ones obtained in the other cases discussed in this work - see table  [ tabresumonh ] .",
    "so , our conclusion here is that , for a sn at 10  kpc of distance and 15  m@xmath1 , lbne 34  kton argon detector can probe neutrino masses of order of 1  ev , at 95%  c.l .",
    "we stress the fact that knowing neutrino mass hierarchy is fundamental to put limits on neutrino masses from sn and lbne has as one of its objectives determine this property .",
    "even though our supernova neutrino bound seems not to be competitive with the prospective katrin bound , the neutrino mass bound from sn has a lot merit and importance , and , of course , it should be a source of strong investigation . with improvements in the detector efficiency ,",
    "the number of events per bin would increase and a more competitive bound could be obtained .",
    "we remember that efficiency includes several effects , such as , loss of events due to light attenuation , fluctuations of the number of photoelectrons , the geometry of the detector etc . these are still unknown sources of errors , and their knowledge is crutial for a more detailed work than presented here .",
    "we are aware that our assumptions are very crude , however , as stated by the lbne collaboration in  @xcite , work in understanding the physics and choices of detector is still underway .",
    "it is necessary to determine , for example , the low energy response of the detector , its geometry , its real threshold , the reconstruction of the events , event vertex resolution , the energy resolution , absolute event @xmath102 time precision and other details .",
    "that is why we are being very conservative , but at the same time , very optimistic in this work .",
    "however , we should stress that considering this time binned analysis , we have demonstrated that statistical fluctuation may play a major role in the determination of the neutrino mass bound .",
    "we point out that a more dedicated mc simulation , with real and proper detector information , with an effective study of a possible event - by - event likelihood of detection for this flux of @xmath0 of neutronization burst and , finally , the importance of the time of the first event detected should be studied deeply in the foreseeable future .",
