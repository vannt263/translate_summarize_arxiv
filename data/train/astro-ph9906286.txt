    "determining mass components of clusters of galaxies is an important task in observational cosmology , since clusters form through the collapse of a large volume of primordial matter , and as such may provide a representative sample of the universe as a whole ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , the total mass of a cluster can be determined from the intracluster gas temperature and density distributions ( @xcite , @xcite ) . until recently ,",
    "most hydrostatic x - ray mass estimates have been made assuming that the gas is isothermal at the average broad beam temperature .",
    "asca observations provide spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopic measurements of hot clusters , and yield the 2d temperature structure of clusters . indeed , a large number of asca clusters shows that the temperature declines with increasing radius from the center ( @xcite ) , in qualitative accordance with hydrodynamic cluster simulations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the real hydrostatic mass at large cluster radii is smaller than that derived assuming isothermality .",
    "consequently , the gas mass fraction is larger and the `` baryon catastrophe '' even more pronounced , compared to isothermal estimates ( e.g. white & fabian 1995 ) . in this paper",
    ", we estimate the total mass for the a401 cluster , using the actual temperature profile .",
    "our method is essentially the one used for a2163 ( @xcite ) and a2256 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and model the dark matter component using several different functional forms .",
    "we use the rosat data to fix the gas density profile and fit hydrostatic temperature models , as a function of dark matter density parameters , to the asca data .",
    "a401 ( z = 0.0748 ) is suitable for measuring the dark and total mass distributions , since it is fairly bright and hot ( @xmath10 8 kev ) allowing accurate temperature determinations with asca .",
    "also , the asca field of view covers the cluster to @xmath2 ( the radius where the mean interior density equals 500 times the critical density , approximately the radius inside which hydrostatic equilibrium holds ) .",
    "a401 also has been observed with the rosat pspc , which gives an accurate estimate of the gas content of a401 and shows no obvious substructure and no significant deviations from azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the asca 2d temperature map ( @xcite ) shows no strong asymmetric variation .",
    "thus the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is likely to be valid .",
    "a401 is peculiar in the sense that it shows no significant evidence of a cooling flow ( see peres et al .",
    "1998 , who find only an upper limit for the mass deposition rate ) , even though it has a prominent cd galaxy at its center and no evidence of recent merger activity either in the temperature map or in the x - ray image .",
    "however , the rosat hri image shows a linear structure in the neighboring cluster a399 , pointing towards a401 , as possible evidence of some past interaction ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of a significant cooling flow simplifies our analysis since we need not consider multicomponent temperature models in the center .",
    "we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 and report 90% confidence intervals throughout the paper .",
    "the rosat data consist of two pspc pointings of a401 , rp800235n00 and rp800182n00 , the former taken on july 29 , 1992 and the latter on january 22 , 1992 .",
    "the total exposure times are 7457 s and 6735 s respectively .",
    "reductions were carried out using snowden s soft x - ray background programs ( @xcite ) , which reduced the total exposure to 11.7 ks .",
    "the spatial analysis was restricted to the band of 0.44 - 2.04 kev ( snowden s bands r4-r7 ) to improve sensitivity over the x - ray background ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the non - cosmic x - ray background was subtracted using snowden s code .",
    "all detector and telescope effects , including vignetting , the mirror support structure shadows and varying detector quantum efficiency , together with the aspect and livetime information are incorporated in exposure maps for each band .",
    "all analysis was done in each of the four bands , for both pointings , the resulting images were divided by the corresponding exposure maps and combined . the surface brightness contour map ( smoothed by a gaussian with @xmath13 = 1@xmath14 )",
    "is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the data show no obvious substructure and no strong deviations from azimuthal symmetry , implying that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is likely to be valid .      with our spatial analysis",
    ", we wish to address two questions .",
    "first , how far from the cluster center can we significantly detect the cluster emission , and second , how is the cluster gas distributed .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the surface brightness ( cluster + background ) reaches a constant level at a distance of about 30@xmath14 from the center (= 3.4 @xmath15 ) so we measure the cosmic x - ray background , plus any residual detector background , from the same image at radii between 30@xmath14 and 52@xmath14 . to exclude any contribution from the nearby cluster a399 we excluded an azimuthal sector centered at a401 , directed at a399 ( 154@xmath16 clockwise from the north ) , from our analysis . to determine the region to be excluded , we increased the angular extent of the excluded sector until the background level reached a minimum value , with a sector width of 160@xmath16 .",
    "thus , the contribution of a399 to the 30@xmath14 - 52@xmath14 annulus ( and inner annuli as well ) becomes negligible outside this sector .",
    "we use the minimum value estimated above , 1.8 @xmath17 counts s@xmath18 arcmin@xmath19 , as the total background value .",
    "we excluded point sources and background fluctuations from our analysis . around a radius of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 - @xmath22 ) it is not clear whether the small fluctuations are associated with cluster emission or not .",
    "the detector support rib near 20@xmath14 may be causing some residual effects .",
    "this led us to two schemes , where we masked out , in addition to unambiguous point sources at other radii , i ) all point - like sources between @xmath21 - @xmath22 ( a conservative scheme ) and ii ) none of those sources ( a non - conservative scheme ) , the truth being somewhere between .",
    "we generated a radial surface brightness profile in concentric annuli ranging from @xmath23 at the center to @xmath24 at a radial distance of @xmath25 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios as a function of radius include 5% of the background value as a systematic error added in quadrature . in the conservative scheme , we can detect the cluster gas emission with 2.6 @xmath13 significance at @xmath26 , and in the non - conservative scheme with 3.8 @xmath13 significance at the same radius , so we conclude that we detect the cluster gas at @xmath27 up to @xmath28 ( 2.9   h@xmath29 mpc ) . in our further analysis",
    "we consider only the profile of the conservative scheme .",
    "we fitted the observed profile with the @xmath30- model plus background    @xmath31    ( @xcite ) , where @xmath32 is the projected radius and background bgd is fixed to the value found above .",
    "we used xspec to convolve the surface brightness model through a spatial response matrix ( constructed from the rosat psf at 1 kev , for a spherically symmetric on - axis source ) and to compare the convolved profile with the data .",
    "the brightness in the two innermost bins ( @xmath33 ) rises 2.1 @xmath13 and 1.2 @xmath13 , or 47% and 12% , above the best fit @xmath30 - model , respectively .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with peres et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who found that the a401 data , consistent with no cooling flow , did allow a mass accretion rate up to 120 @xmath34/yr in the center of a401 within a cooling radius of @xmath35 arcmin . even though the central excess in our data is statistically not very significant , we excluded our two innermost bins from the @xmath30 fit to prevent any bias towards small values of the core radius .",
    "we find an acceptable fit in the radial range 0.5@xmath14 - 52@xmath14 ( see figure [ surfbright_plot ] and table [ tab1 ] ) , with best fit parameters and 90 % confidence errors of @xmath36 arcmin (= @xmath37 kpc ) , @xmath38 , i@xmath39 counts s@xmath18 arcmin@xmath19 ) at @xmath40 , with @xmath41 = 49.7 for 55 degrees of freedom .",
    "the confidence contours for @xmath42 and @xmath30 are shown in figure [ confcont_plot ] .",
    "our values of @xmath42 and @xmath30 are consistent with the results of another study of the rosat data of a401 ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "if we assume that the intracluster gas is isothermal and spherically symmetric , the best - fit parameters @xmath42 and @xmath30 will determine the shape of the gas density profile by the equation : @xmath43 a401 is hot and even the temperature variations such as those detected by asca do not significantly affect the brightness in the rosat band .",
    "we obtained the normalization ( as in @xcite ) @xmath44m@xmath45 mpc@xmath46 , or 1.1 @xmath47 g cm@xmath46 , by equating the emission measure calculated from the above equation , with an observed value of 16.7 @xmath49 cm@xmath46 inside a cylinder with @xmath50 @xmath0 mpc radius , centered at the cluster brightness peak .",
    "the gas mass in this best fit model inside the sphere of @xmath2 ( = @xmath51 = 1.7 @xmath0 mpc , calculated in section [ coreres ] ) is @xmath52 white & fabian ( 1995 ) give a gas mass value of @xmath53 m@xmath45 inside 1.3 @xmath0 mpc whereas our corresponding value at the same radius is @xmath54 , consistent with theirs .",
    "the error interval in ( [ gasmass ] ) corresponds to the 90% confidence region in @xmath42 - @xmath30 - space in our global fit ( see figure [ confcont_plot ] ) .",
    "the gas mass error within @xmath2 is negligible with respect to the other errors in the quantities we are interested in this work .",
    "therefore we ignore the above error in our further analysis .",
    "the gas temperature distribution is obtained from the asca spectral data of a401 , excluding a sector towards a399 , as described in detail in markevitch et al .",
    "the data are divided into four concentric radial bins , 0@xmath14 - 2@xmath14 - 5@xmath14 - 9@xmath14 - 16@xmath14 ( 0 - 0.23 - 0.57 - 1.0 - 1.8 h@xmath29 mpc ) .",
    "the temperature errors were determined by generating monte - carlo data sets which properly account for the statistical and systematic uncertainties ( including psf effects ) .",
    "figure [ temperatures_plot ] shows the best fit projected temperatures and 1@xmath13 errors in each of the four radial bins .",
    "we note a slight ( by a factor of 1.2 or 1 @xmath13 ) increase of the temperature in the center , compared to a quite constant value in bins 2@xmath14 - 5@xmath14 - 9@xmath14 .",
    "the temperature in the 9@xmath14 - 16@xmath14 bin falls by a factor of 1.8 or 2.7 @xmath13 below the value in the 5@xmath14 - 9@xmath14 annulus .",
    "similar radial temperature declines have been observed in a large sample of asca clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the single temperature fit gives a mean temperature of kt = @xmath55 kev ( @xcite ) , which is consistent with the einstein mpc value kt = @xmath56 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature profile values are consistent with the single temperature only by a probability of smaller than @xmath57 , therefore a401 is significantly non - isothermal .",
    "we note that even though at the cluster center we saw a slight brightness excess ( @xmath58 % ) compared to the @xmath30-model , the sky area covered by the central bins ( @xmath59 ) is only 6% of the area covered by the innermost asca temperature bin of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore the contribution of the brightness excess to the total emission from the central temperature bin is negligible , and we ignore the effect of a possibly different temperature for this excess emission .",
    "the derivation of cluster temperature profiles from the asca data is not straightforward due to the wide and energy - dependent psf .",
    "takahashi et al . ( 1995 ) showed that if the psf effect is neglected , an intrinsically isothermal cluster will appear significantly hotter with asca at large radius ( a 7 kev cluster would appear to have a temperature of @xmath10 20 kev at a 20@xmath14 radius ) . for a401 , fujita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) analyzed the same asca dataset and derived an approximately constant temperature profile . from the description in their paper",
    ", it appears that they did not properly include psf scattering effects .",
    "this would have an effect of diminishing the radial temperature decline , consistent with the difference of the two results . rosat pspc data on a401 in the 0.22 kev band",
    "were also analyzed by irwin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who derive a temperature increase with radius .",
    "taking into account the pspc calibration uncertainty which is very significant for determining temperatures of hot clusters with pspc ( see , e.g. , markevitch & vikhlinin 1997a ) , their results would probably be consistent with ours . among other clusters in the markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sample , asca data for a4059 and mkw3s were recently independently analyzed by kikuchi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using an independent method .",
    "although these authors do not find radial temperature gradients as strong as in markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , they also do not detect the strong cooling flows that are known to exist in those clusters ( e.g. , peres et al .",
    "1998 ) , which indicates possible problems with their results . for another cluster from that sample , hydra - a , the markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) declining temperature profile is in good agreement with an analysis by ikebe et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using a different technique .",
    "a strong radial temperature decline was also recently derived for a2218 by cannon , ponman , & hobbs ( 1999 ) using yet another method .",
    "still another technique developed by churazov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) yields a temperature structure in coma and a1367 consistent with the markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) method ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the a401 temperature profile that we use in this work , is similar to profiles of a large sample of asca clusters ( @xcite ) , when compared in the physically meaningful units of the radius of a given overdensity .",
    "therefore it appears unlikely that the observed temperature decline is caused by any unknown detector - dependent systematic effect .",
    "in addition to our four asca temperature points , we have some crude temperature information from the rosat data . since we have a significant ( @xmath10 3 @xmath13 ) detection of the cluster gas in the 22@xmath14 - 25@xmath14 (= 2.5 - 2.9 @xmath0 mpc ) annulus we know that the gas temperature there must exceed zero .",
    "therefore we introduce a rosat temperature point kt @xmath61 0 kev at 22@xmath14 - 25@xmath14 .",
    "we will now use the asca and rosat temperature data to estimate the total mass of a401 . for this",
    ", we assume that a401 is spherically symmetric and that its gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( as indicated in section [ redu ] ) . from this condition",
    "the total mass within a sphere of radius @xmath62 can be written as ( e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath63    using @xmath64 .",
    "we consider the total mass consisting of stellar mass in galaxies , intracluster gas , and dark matter .",
    "we estimate the amount of stellar mass in galaxies using dressler s ( 1978 ) king profile fit to the galaxy distribution in a401 with a core radius of 0.4 @xmath0 mpc and a v band luminosity of @xmath65 @xmath66 l@xmath45 inside 1 core radius .",
    "even though the fit extends only to a 12@xmath14 radius , we extrapolate this distribution to 15.1@xmath14 (= @xmath2 ) using the above king profile , and obtain a v band luminosity of @xmath67 @xmath66 l@xmath45 .",
    "we convert this value to galaxy mass , using a mass - to - light ratio of 3.2 m@xmath45/l@xmath45 @xmath68 ( taken from @xcite ) , assuming a coma - like luminosity function for galaxies in a401 , and an m / l relation from van der marel ( 1991 ) .",
    "we find a stellar mass in galaxies of 3.3 @xmath69 @xmath0 m@xmath45 , or 16 @xmath70 % of our gas mass value , or 4 % of our total mass value within @xmath2 .",
    "since this is much less than the uncertainty of our total mass estimates , we will not model this component separately , but rather include it in the dark matter model .",
    "this does not introduce any ambiguity in the interpretation of dark matter parameters ( except for the normalization ) , since our best fit dark matter profile scales like the king profile at large radii ( see below ) and the core radius of this model is similar to the best fit king profile of the galaxy distribution in a401 ( dressler 1978 ) .",
    "quantitatively , the total mass is given as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the density profiles of the dark matter plus stars and gas , respectively .    in principle",
    ", the mass can be calculated directly from equation [ hydreq ] , if the gas temperature profile is known in detail . however , our temperature profile is not of sufficient quality to allow this procedure .",
    "we therefore use an indirect method which assumes various models for the total mass radial distribution , calculates the corresponding temperature profiles , and compares them to the data , looking for acceptable models .",
    "following markevitch & vikhlinin ( 1997b ) , we model the dark matter density distribution @xmath74 using two different functional forms , which together approximate a wide range of physically motivated spherically symmetric distributions .",
    "a constant core model has a dark matter density given by @xmath75 and the central cusp profile is described as : @xmath76 in the equations above , @xmath77 is the scale length of the dark matter distribution . in the cusp model",
    ". [ cuspmodel ] ) , the first term describes the cusp behaviour near the center . in both models , the density at large radii scales as @xmath78 . with @xmath79 = 1 and @xmath80 = 3 , the cusp model corresponds to the `` universal density profile '' which navarro et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 , nfw hereafter ) show to be a good description of cluster cdm halos in simulations of hierarchical clustering . since the quality of the data is not adequate for deriving the values of all the parameters independently ,",
    "we fix @xmath79 = 1 in the cusp models , as suggested by the nfw simulations , but vary the other parameters .    as in markevitch & vikhlinin ( 1997b )",
    ", we solve the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( eq . [ hydreq ] ) for the gas temperature as a function of radius and gas and dark matter density parameters ( using the @xmath30 model for the gas density profile ) :",

    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 are the gas temperature and density at @xmath90 .    for the gas density distribution",
    ", we use the @xmath30 model parameters derived from the rosat surface brightness analysis ( section [ spat ] ) .",
    "the remaining parameters to be fitted to the temperature data are @xmath80 , @xmath77 , @xmath86 and @xmath88 .",
    "while computing the temperature profiles , we use analytic solutions for the integrals in equation ( [ a4 ] ) in the cluster center to avoid the numeric effects of the singularity in the integral in equation ( [ a5 ] ) . beyond 0.2 @xmath42",
    "we switch to numerical integration , preserving continuity .",
    "step sizes for the numerical integrations are chosen to achieve a 1% accuracy in the computed temperatures .",
    "for each set of dark matter profile parameters and @xmath88 we computed the 3d temperature profile , and projected it to the observed 2d asca annuli , weighting the line of sight temperatures with the emission measure of each volume element intersected by the asca annuli .",
    "the projected model temperatures were then compared with the measured asca temperature values .",
    "the parameter values were changed iteratively to minimize @xmath91 .    to incorporate the rosat temperature point ( section [ rosattemp ] ) in the fitting procedure",
    ", we do the following : if the model temperature at 22@xmath14 - 25@xmath14 becomes negative , an exponential increment is added to @xmath41 ( the more negative the value , the higher the increment ) , but as soon as the trial value in the fit becomes positive , the contribution of that data point to @xmath41 vanishes .",
    "this arrangement will `` steer '' the fitting procedure smoothly towards positive temperature values in the 22@xmath14 - 25@xmath14 bin , without bias towards any arbitrary temperature value .",
    "the model temperature profile is very sensitive to small changes in the parameter values . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature errors and the widths of the radial bins are quite large , due to poor statistics .",
    "therefore , a large range of parameter values gives a good description of the data .",
    "these two features led to difficulties using standard minimization routines , which often find local @xmath41-minima .",
    "we dealt with this problem by applying the simulated annealing method ( @xcite ) .",
    "before presenting the results of our mass fits , we briefly address the question of convective stability , since some of our model temperature profiles , formally allowed by the data , have strong gradients at large radii and at the very center ( especially the cusp models ) .",
    "these strong temperature gradients may not be consistent with the requirement of convective stability .",
    "if the gas at radius @xmath62 is to be stable against convection , the effective polytropic index at that radius , defined as @xmath92 must be less than @xmath93 . during a dynamical time , all convective instabilities should have been erased , and clusters in general should be convectively stable , therefore strong temperature gradients can not exist .",
    "however , at large radii , hydrostatic equilibrium may not have time to establish . simulations ( @xcite ) suggest that @xmath2 ( the radius where the mean interior density is 500 times the critical density ) provides a conservative upper limit for the radius inside which the gas should be hydrostatic",
    ". however , in many simulated clusters , hydrostatic balance holds at evenlarger radii . for a401 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , the radius where the mean interior density is 150 times the critical density",
    "hence , at the radial range of our asca data ( @xmath96 ) the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption is likely to be valid , and we are justified to require that the model temperature profiles be convectively stable . at the maximum radius of rosat detection ( 25@xmath14 )",
    "the case is less certain . in the evrard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) simulations , some clusters exhibit significant gas bulk motion at these radii . depending on the cosmological scenario , at @xmath97 the kinetic pressure may be comparable to the thermal pressure , and the systems may be far from hydrostatic equilibrium . since a401 is an apparently relaxed cluster ,",
    "strong deviations from equilibrium are unlikely even at that radius . in order to be conservative",
    ", we will not apply the above convective stability constraint , @xmath98 , at radii beyond @xmath2 .",
    "also , we do not apply it to our solutions at @xmath59 because at that radial range the cluster brightness does not agree with the @xmath30 model .",
    "while using the rosat temperature information at @xmath28 in our fits , we are extrapolating the hydrostatic temperature profile to a possibly non - hydrostatic region of the cluster ( out to @xmath97 ) , but this should not introduce a significant error .",
    "cluster formation simulations show that temperature profiles of clusters decline with the radius without any dramatic change in the temperature profiles between @xmath2 and @xmath97 , so that our extrapolation is justified , even though the kinetic pressure may become comparable to the thermal pressure at @xmath97 . furthermore , if the gravity of the total mass inside r@xmath99 balances the thermal plus kinetic pressure at that radius , for a given mass distribution the temperature implied by the hydrostatic model is _ higher _ than the observed one .",
    "hence , in our fitting the requirement that the hydrostatic model temperature exceed zero at r@xmath99 , is conservative . a possible complication , a t@xmath100 - t@xmath101 nonequality at large radii ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) would have the same effect .",
    "we now discuss results of fits using the dark mass profile of the core model ( eq . [ coremodel ] ) . to avoid local minima",
    ", we adopted a scheme to fix @xmath80 at several values over an interesting range and to fit the other parameters .",
    "this was necessary , since the effect of this parameter is most significant at large radii where we do not have asca temperature data .",
    "the best fit core model is acceptable , with @xmath41 = 1.29 for 4 parameters and 5 data points ( see figures [ temperatures_plot ] and [ masses_plot ] and table [ tab1 ] ) .",

    "the central dark matter density is 14 times that of the gas .",
    "the core radii of gas and dark matter models are quite similar , and the dark matter density at large radii falls faster , scaling as r@xmath107 , whereas the gas density falls as r@xmath108 . to check whether the solution agrees with the requirement of convective stability , we computed the effective polytropic index as a function of radius , using equation [ gamma ] and used the gas distribution from the best fit @xmath30 model .",
    "this best - fit model is convectively stable in the @xmath109 range .",
    "the overdensity in this best - fit model drops below 500 at radius @xmath110    to propagate the errors of the temperature profile data to our mass values , we fit a large number of monte - carlo temperature profiles with added random errors ( see section [ ascadata ] ) using the same approach as for the best - fit temperature profile .",
    "we noticed that most models had a tendency for the temperature to fall to zero at radii below @xmath28 ( because of the strong decline of the temperature between the two outermost asca bins ) , therefore our rosat temperature information at large radius provides a powerful constraint .",
    "we rejected unphysical models which gave infinite temperatures at large radii .",
    "each monte - carlo model was checked against the convective stability constraint , and rejected if @xmath111 in the @xmath112 range .",
    "the excluded models are those with the sharpest temperature peaks in the center , or those with the smallest core radii , which are also the models with smallest @xmath80 due to the parameter correlations .",
    "the mass in the models with the smallest @xmath80 values increases fastest with radius , therefore large masses are constrained more strongly . from the distribution of the accepted monte - carlo models , we determine the 1 @xmath13 scatter of the mass values as a function of the radius .",
    "we convert these values to 90% confidence values , assuming a gaussian probability distribution .",
    "although in general we can not constrain the dark matter model parameters independently , some of these parameters are correlated and the corresponding mass values vary within a relatively narrow range and can be reasonably constrained .    since the total mass is proportional to the local logarithmic derivative of the gas density distribution ( @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) , we quantified the effects of the uncertainty of the local @xmath30 value and its possible deviations from the global value ( see section [ spat ] ) that we used in our mass computation .",

    "therefore , the mass values and errors obtained earlier with the core model will be our final values ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .    even though the cusp model gives an acceptable fit to the temperature data , because of the centrally peaked form of this model it always violates the convective stability constraint at the center , even at radii @xmath121 where the gas profile is well defined by the @xmath30 model . models with",

    "such a pressure must satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium condition without inducing turbulence , which would require , for example , an equation of state @xmath125 with @xmath126 ( e.g. , landau & lifshitz 1959 ) .",
    "note that a401 is rather unusual in that it has a cd galaxy but no significantly detected cooling flow and gas density peak usually found in cd clusters .",

    "this slope is also the same as found by nwf in their simulations , although the simulated clusters also exhibit a central density cusp . for a401 ,",
    "such a cusp violates the convective stability condition in the cluster center , because the gas density is well described by a standard @xmath30 model .",

    "regardless of the presence or absence of a central cusp , the total mass within @xmath2 ( 1.7 @xmath0 mpc ) is @xmath168 at the 90 % confidence .",
    "the mass within the x - ray core ( 290 @xmath0 kpc ) is a factor of 1.3 higher than the value from an isothermal analysis while at @xmath2 the value is 0.9 the isothermal value , which is qualitatively similar to the a2256 result ( markevitch & vikhlinin 1997 ) .",
    "our m@xmath169 value is 1.7 times smaller than that predicted by the scaling law of evrard et al .",
    "this discrepancy arises because the simulations do not correctly predict the observed gas density and temperature profiles .",

    "hence the gas mass fraction increases with radius , with @xmath170 ( 90 % errors ) at @xmath2 .",
