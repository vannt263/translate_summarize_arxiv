    "non - superconducting prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 compound attracted considerable attention in the last two decades because of its intriguing magnetic and electronic properties within the reba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath2 family of compounds ( re = rare earth atom).@xcite in spite of the great efforts from both experimental and theoretical sides , numerous problems remain unresolved such as the suppression of superconductivity and the nature of the long - range ordered state of pr sublattice with a unique , about an order of magnitude larger than for other rare earth atoms , ordering temperature .",
    "although , there exists a discussion whether the ground state of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is really a non - superconducting , insulating material with a magnetically ordered cu and pr sublattices , herein we consider this modification of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 as `` canonical '' and treat it solely herein .",
    "we note that superconductivity in prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 was reported@xcite and a non - magnetic pr ground state was found by @xmath8pr nmr.@xcite it was suggested that these observations may result from a non - stoichiometric compound , i.e. when pr occupies only about a half of the rare - earth sites , and the other half is occupied by the non - magnetic ba.@xcite    the theoretical model of fehrenbacher and rice , i.e. the hybridization of pr @xmath9 and the nearest neighbor o @xmath10 orbitals is the most accepted model to account for the absence of superconductivity in prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it is suggested that the localization of holes in the hybridized @xmath9-@xmath10 orbitals renders the material non - superconducting.@xcite although the non - superconducting nature of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath11 compound is a challenging and interesting problem , we concentrate herein exclusively on the low - temperature pr ordering .",
    "prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is an insulator for every @xmath12 and the cu spins in the cuo@xmath0 planes order antiferromagnetically at temperatures of @xmath13k and @xmath14k for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively.@xcite as the temperature is further decreased , the pr sublattice also undergoes a phase transition@xcite in the temperature range @xmath17k depending on @xmath12 , which appears as an anomaly in the temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities.@xcite mssbauer spectroscopy,@xcite neutron diffraction,@xcite and nmr@xcite showed that the pr magnetic moments order antiferromagnetically below @xmath18 . however , there is no consensus among these experiments with respect to the magnitude of the ordered pr moment , its direction , and the nature of this transition .",
    "neutron diffraction studies found @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) ordered moment with direction tilted out from the @xmath4-plane.@xcite the rotation of cu moments within the cuo@xmath0 plane was found to accompany the pr ordering,@xcite which was suggested to result from the strong coupling between the pr and cu subsystems . however , the magnitude of the coupling , its character , and its influence on the magnitude of the ordered pr magnetic moment , and for the ordering temperature is yet unexplained .",
    "we give herein a comprehensive description of the pr ordering in prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath23 on the basis of a model of localized @xmath24 electrons of the pr ion .",
    "we construct the general form of the cu - pr interaction allowed by the symmetry and identify the pr order parameter from the rotation of cu spins below @xmath5 observed by neutron diffraction.@xcite although pseudo - dipole cu - pr interaction has been already proposed,@xcite we derive the cu - pr interaction in general including all pr multipole moments and arbitrary wave vectors .",
    "we describe a crystalline electric field ( cef ) model which takes a ground state quasi - triplet composed by a doublet and a singlet states and also includes coupling between the pr and cu subsystems .",
    "this low - energy scheme is consistent with the neutron diffraction results@xcite and also with the high - temperature susceptibility data.@xcite we also discuss the enhancement of the pr ordering temperature due to the cu - pr coupling and the magnitude of pr magnetic moment in the ordered state .",
    "in prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath23 , the cu spins are antiferromagnetically ordered along the @xmath25 $ ] direction in the cuo@xmath0 planes with the ordering vector @xmath26 $ ] below the temperature @xmath27k ( phase afi).@xcite as the temperature is further decreased , the pr sublattice also undergoes an ordering at temperature @xmath28k .",
    "this ordering is accompanied by the rotation of cu spins within the cuo@xmath0 planes in such a way that the new spin structure is non - collinear along the @xmath29-direction ( phase afiii).@xcite the cu spin rotation is characterized by the ordering vector @xmath30 $ ] . the cu spin structure in the cuo@xmath0 planes is shown in fig .",
    "[ cu - pr - fig ] in the temperature range @xmath31 .",
    "planes and pr dipole moments in the @xmath4-plane in the temperature range @xmath32 .",
    "the central pr ion in the @xmath4-plane is located at position @xmath33 , and the numbers label the cu sites , i.e. cu[1 - 8 ] used in the text . ]",
    "first , we construct the invariant form of the interaction between the multipole moments of a pr ion at position @xmath33 and the surrounding eight cu spins , cu[1 - 8 ] , shown in fig .",
    "[ cu - pr - fig ] .",
    "although the local symmetry at pr site is tetragonal , a cu - pr pair has lower symmetry .",
    "for example , the cu[1]-pr pair has reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath34 $ ] mirror plane .",
    "the transformation of total angular momentum @xmath35 of pr ion under this operation is : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the same transformation is applied for the cu spin @xmath39 .",
    "thus , spin operators @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) are odd , while @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is even under this reflection .",
    "not only the bilinear products of the pr dipole moments and cu spins appear in the interaction but also the bilinear products of rank-3 octupole and rank-5 triakontadipole@xcite operators of pr ion and cu spins since they are allowed by the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the octupole operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 are even , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 are odd operators under the present transformation . in the case of tetragonal symmetry , there is one more independent magnetic operator , namely the rank-5 triakontadipole operator @xmath50 which is even under the present reflexion .",
    "thus , the invariant form of the interaction for the cu[1]-pr pair is constructed as @xmath51 & = & ( s_{x}+s_{y})\\left [ c_{11}(j_{x}+j_{y } ) + c_{12 } t^{\\beta}_{z } + c_{13}a_{1u }     \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + &    ( s_{x}-s_{y})\\left [ c_{21}(j_{x}-j_{y } ) + c_{22 } j_{z } + c_{23 } t_{xyz }      \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & s_{z}\\left [ c_{31}(j_{x}-j_{y } ) + c_{32 } j_{z } + c_{33 } t_{xyz }      \\right ] ,   \\label{int1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are constants which are not determined by the symmetry itself .",
    "the pair cu[2]-pr is connected to the pair cu[1]-pr by a @xmath53 rotation around the @xmath29-axis . under this operation",
    "the transformation of the angular momentum components is given by @xmath54 , @xmath37 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the same transformation holds also for the cu spin components .",

    "now we discuss the multipole order of pr sublattice based on expression ( [ int ] ) . in phase afi ,",
    "the cu spin component @xmath65 with @xmath66 is non - zero . in this phase",
    "there is no coupling between the cu spins and pr magnetic moments because the wave vector @xmath67 leads to @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which gives that none of the terms survives in expression ( [ int ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a coupling of cu spins and pr moments is present in phase afiii .",
    "the non - collinear cu spin structure in phase afiii can be described by the appearance of the extra spin component @xmath70 in addition to the component @xmath71 .",
    "the wave vector @xmath72 gives @xmath73 , @xmath74=1 , and @xmath75 , @xmath76 in expression ( [ int ] ) .",
    "together with the condition @xmath77 , we find that the only surviving term in the form of cu - pr interaction is the coupling @xmath78 .",
    "we note that the coupling @xmath79 is also allowed by symmetry since the @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath80 $ ] domains in phase afi are equivalent , which gives that the domains @xmath81 and @xmath82 are also equivalent .",
    "thus , we conclude that the neutron diffraction result for the cu spin rotation below @xmath5 is compatible with pr dipole moments lying along the crystalline @xmath25 $ ] or @xmath80 $ ] direction , and no deviation from this direction is allowed by symmetry in contrast to the structure proposed in ref .  .",
    "since the @xmath83 cu spin components alternate along the @xmath84 and @xmath85 directions , the pr dipole moments also form an afm structure in the @xmath4-planes with the ordering vector @xmath72 .",
    "the magnetic structure for the cu spins and pr dipole moments below @xmath5 has the structure shown in fig .  [ cu - pr - fig ] .",

    "we studied the nature of the pr ordered phase in prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath23 in a quasi - triplet cef model of 4@xmath86 electrons , where we also included the symmetry allowed coupling between the pr and cu ions .",
    "the reason to include cu - pr coupling is the cu spin rotation observed at the pr ordering temperature in neutron diffraction,@xcite which has not been observed for other rare earth reba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath23 compounds . in the 4@xmath171 rare - earth series ,",
    "the localized electrons of pr ion tend to hybridize rather strongly with conduction electrons as in e.g. prfe@xmath172p@xmath173",
    ". this can be the reason why the cu - re coupling is much stronger in reba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath23 for re = pr compared to the other rare - earth ions , re .",
    "we showed by a general symmetry analysis that there is no coupling between the cu and pr subsystems in phase afi , but a coupling emerges in phase afiii .",
    "we prove that only the afm ordering of @xmath174 dipole moments of pr ions is consistent with the cu spin rotation observed at @xmath100 by neutron diffraction.@xcite the interpretation of the neutron diffraction data in ref .",
    "includes a tilting of the ordered pr magnetic moments out of the @xmath4-plane .",
    "however , the presence of non - zero @xmath42 dipole component does not follow from the general symmetry analysis as it was shown in section  [ cu - pr - interaction ] .    upon identifying of the pr order parameter , we studied the pr ordering temperature in the cu - pr coupled quasi - triplet cef model by changing the interaction and cef parameters .",
    "we found that the cu - pr coupling enhances the pr ordering temperature , @xmath5 , compared to the uncoupled ordering temperature , @xmath124 .    by fixing the pr - pr and pr - cu interaction parameters to the values obtained by neutron diffraction,@xcite and the cef parameter to that obtained by high - temperature susceptibility measurements,@xcite we found that the pr ordering temperature is considerably enhanced due to the cu - pr coupling in the parameter range @xmath175k .",
    "namely , the enhancement of the ordering temperature is as large as @xmath176 in this interval .",
    "this observation explains the uniquely large ordering temperature for re = pr in the series reba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we predicted the magnetic field angle dependence of the local magnetic field acting at a pr site in the afm ordered phase of the pr ions . this can be directly compared to measured nmr or esr spectra which detect the local magnetic field by a local magnetic probe .",
    "our model contains the minimal number of parameters which is required to account quantitatively for the experimental data .",
    "given that the parameter values are assumed from independent measurements and no fit is performed , the agreement is reasonable .",
    "first , the realistic estimate @xmath175k gives a @xmath5 of @xmath177k which is to be compared to the experimental @xmath5 of @xmath178k .",
    "we note that this estimated range gives the pr transition temperature @xmath124 for the uncoupled system as @xmath179k , which is close to the typical values of the ordering temperatures for other rare - earth ions such as yb ( @xmath180k ) , nd ( @xmath181k ) or dy ( @xmath182k ) .",
    "this fact may also indicate that the uniquely large ordering temperature for pr arises from the cu - pr coupling .",
    "second , the interval @xmath175k is not very far from the estimate @xmath183k based on the analysis of the high - temperature susceptibility data.@xcite furthermore , the estimated interval for @xmath94 and also the splitting pattern of the quasi - triplet subspace is consistent with the results of neutron scattering,@xcite which found that the splitting of the ground state quasi - triplet does not exceed @xmath184mev above @xmath5 , and two inelastic lines are observed at energies @xmath185mev and @xmath186mev at @xmath187k in the ordered phase .",
    "finally , for the interval @xmath175k our cef model gives the ordered pr magnetic moment at low temperatures as @xmath188 , which is to be compared to the observed value @xmath189.@xcite the quantitative discrepancies between the results of our model and the experimental data arise because of the simplicity of our model and minimal number of parameters .    in summary",
    ", the model we propose herein describes the main features of prba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath23 system , and demonstrates the importance of the cu - pr coupling which may be the key point to understand the anomalous behavior of this compound such as the enhancement of the pr ordering temperature .",
    "further studies which include also the itinerant character of @xmath24 electrons are necessary to give an extensive description of this rather complicated system .",
