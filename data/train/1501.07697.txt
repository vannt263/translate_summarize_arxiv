    "bose einstein condensation has been experimentally achieved with particles in a trap - generally a simple harmonic oscillator potential . the condensate is well described in terms of the gross pitaevskii equation ( gpe)@xcite both for the energy ( chemical potential ) of the stationary state and as well as dynamics . to find the lowest energy of the system , one can use a variational estimate with a gaussian trial function for a thomas fermi approximation which ignores the kinetic energy of the particles .",
    "the thomas fermi approximation works well for a large number of particles but generally is an underestimate as compared to the variational calculation . hence finding the correction to the thomas fermi limit is of interest .",
    "the first attempt at doing this is the work of schuch and vin @xcite who combined a wkb type of analysis with the thomas fermi idea to obtain a very effective modified thomas fermi energy .",
    "it has not been noticed yet that analogous to the thomas fermi limit is the infinite dimension ( large @xmath1 ) limit for finding the ground state energy of a quantum mechanical problem @xcite .",
    "as @xmath2 , the kinetic energy becomes negligible and one finds the ground state energy from a minimization of an effective potential .",
    "corrections are obtained in a systematic fashion by first considering simple harmonic motion about the minimum and then including anharmonicity .",
    "our point in this article is that the first correction to the thomas fermi energy can be found in a manner analogous to the correction to the @xmath2 limit and also the large @xmath1 approach can be combined with the thomas fermi limit to yield accurate answers more easily .    in sec",
    "ii , we will recall the large @xmath1 quantum mechanical problem .",
    "we will first consider the harmonic oscillator potential where the exact answer is obtained at the leading order itself and all subsequent corrections are zero .",
    "more pertinent is the an - harmonic oscillator which we treat next and show that a two term answer is a significant improvement on the leading terms . in section iii , we use the philosophy of approach to find the correction to the thomas fermi limit in a one dimensional problem . in sec iv , we combine the large @xmath1 approach with the thomas fermi limit to obtain the large @xmath1 approach with the thomas fermi limit to obtain a very reasonable estimate of the stationary state energy .",
    "in this section , we recall the @xmath3 expansion for the harmonic oscillator and the an - harmonic oscillator .",
    "we will get the ground state energy to two term accurately in each case and compare with the known exact ( analytic or numerical ) answer at @xmath4 , which is the worst situation for the technique.even in this very unfavorable situation , the comparison between approximation and reality is good , giving us confidence in this procedure .",
    "the laplacian operator for the zero angular momentum state in a n - dimensional space has the form @xmath5 consequently , the schr@xmath6dinger equation for the ground state of the simple harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath7 reads @xmath8 where , @xmath9 is the mass of the particle and @xmath10 is the ground state energy .",

    "the first correction to the leading order is obtained by expanding @xmath25 about @xmath26 and writing @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the @xmath2 form and for finite @xmath1 , @xmath29 is the variation around the infinite @xmath1 limit . to the leading order",
