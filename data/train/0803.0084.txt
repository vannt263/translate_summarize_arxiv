    "the presence of a powerful radio source is known to have profound implications for the properties of both the host galaxy and the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) . while the host galaxies are usually massive ellipticals with predominantly old stellar populations formed at @xmath1 ( e.g. inskip et al 2002a ) , increasing evidence is accumulating for more recent star formation in many sources ( e.g. wills et al 2007 , holt et al 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "extended emission line regions ( eelrs ) are frequently observed around radio galaxies ( mccarthy et al 1987 ) , and their observed properties ( size , luminosity , kinematics and ionisation state ) are known to depend strongly on those of the radio source ( e.g. best et al 2000 , inskip et al 2002b , c , moy & rocca - volmerange 2002 , humphrey et al 2006 ) .",
    "however , the origin of the emitting material is less well understood .",
    "overall , disentangling cause from effect within these complex systems is far from straightforward ; which properties are genuine symptoms of the radio source activity , and which can be tied to the underlying agn triggering mechanism ?",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) provides a powerful tool for addressing questions such as these .",
    "the additional spatial data provided by ifs observations is a major advantage , as it allows the eelr properties ( physical conditions , gas dynamics , ionisation state ) to be efficiently studied and quantified as a function of position relative to the radio source , rather than just along the radio axis , as is commonly the case for most long - slit spectroscopic studies . in this paper",
    ", we consider the case of the @xmath2 radio galaxy pks2250 - 41 , previous observations of which have shown it to be surrounded by one of the most impressive eelrs identified at intermediate redshifts ( tadhunter et al 1994 ; clark et al 1997 ; villar - martn et al 1999 ) .",
    "we present the results of a multi - wavelength study of this source , combining optical ifs spectroscopy , optical long - slit spectroscopy , near - ir imaging and optical continuum and emission line imaging .",
    "the details of the source , our observations and data reduction are described in section 2 , and the results presented in section 3 , including an analysis of potential companion objects at a similar redshift . in section 4 , we discuss the implications of our results , and we present our conclusions in section 5 . throughout this paper , we assume cosmological parameters of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which result in an angular scale of @xmath6kpc / arcsec at @xmath2 .",
    "pks2250 - 41 is an frii radio source hosted by an elliptical galaxy lying at a redshift of @xmath7 , and a member of the large sample of southern 2jy sources selected for study by morganti , killeen and tadhunter ( 1993 ) and tadhunter et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "[ fig : radio ] displays the most recent optical and infrared imaging of this source , overlaid with vla radio contours .",
    "the eelr surrounding pks2250 - 41 is particularly striking , and has been well - studied in the past .",
    "imaging , spectroscopic and polarimetric observations of this source were obtained in 1993 , and the results presented in a number of papers ( tadhunter et al 1994 , shaw et al 1995 and clark et al 1997 ) .",
    "the major feature of this source is the bright emission line arc lying approximately 5.5 arcsec west of the host galaxy , circumscribing the radio lobe , with lower surface brightness line emission lying to the east of the host galaxy .",
    "the varied gas kinematics and ionization states observed in the western arc provide some of the best evidence in any active galaxy for the presence of shocked gas with a photoionized precursor region , plausibly caused by jet - cloud interactions .",
    "emission line density and temperature diagnostics imply high pressures in the western radio lobe , suggesting pressure equilibrium within this region .",
    "after subtraction of the nebular continuum emission from this region , dickson et al ( 1995 ) found that the remaining continuum is relatively blue in colour , while shaw et al ( 1995 ) showed that it is also unpolarised .",
    "clark et al ( 1997 ) hypothesise that the western arc originates from a direct collision between the radio jet and a companion object .",
    "they also suggest that the galaxy lying at a distance of approximately 10.5 arcsec/50 kpc to the northeast of pks2250 - 41 lies at a similar redshift to the radio source and that the two galaxies may be undergoing some level of interaction .",
    "it should be noted that their data were of lower signal - to - noise , and were not definitive with regard to the redshift of the companion .    on the basis of the clear evidence for jet - cloud interactions displayed by this source , villar - martn et al ( 1999 ; hereafter vm99 ) carried out a",
    "further , higher resolution spectroscopic study utilising four different slit positions , three aligned on , above and below the host galaxy centroid and parallel to the radio axis , and one perpendicular to the radio source axis , aligned with the western emission - line arc .",
    "two different kinematic components were identified within the gas , and the other emission line properties ( temperature , ionization state , ionization mechanism ) clarified , adding strong support to the picture of cooling gas behind a shock front driven by the radio jets , as well as a photoionized precursor region ."
