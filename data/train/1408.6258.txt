    "network reciprocity  @xcite is a general mechanism responsible for the development of spatial correlations within a viscous population , opening the possibility of persistent cooperation .",
    "several specific models have been proposed showing how these correlations are related to stable groups of cooperating individuals , whose bulk benefits of self - defense and mutual support outcompete the surface exploitation by defectors  @xcite .",
    "although actual experiments have been performed  @xcite , most of our knowledge comes from these simple models . in particular , a prevailing characteristic in real systems and an important ingredient for cooperation is the heterogeneous contact in systems whose interactions are given by complex  @xcite or diluted networks  @xcite .",
    "when we consider the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) dynamics  @xcite on a diluted lattice that , albeit heterogeneous , has only short range interactions , intermediate densities present an enhancement of cooperation  @xcite and , in the presence of a small amount of noise , the optimal dilution is closely related to the ( random site ) percolation threshold for that lattice  @xcite .",
    "whatever the level of heterogeneity , the contact network topology may evolve in time .",
    "although several rewiring mechanisms can be devised ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , this may also be accomplished when the high viscosity restriction is relaxed and the agents become mobile . mobility patterns on different scales of human activity , and their far fetched consequences , have been studied in recent decades .",
    "for example , airplane displacement and its connection with disease spread  @xcite , on a global level , can be contrasted with the more local dynamics of pedestrians , crowds or traffic  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is how the observed patterns can affect the outcome of the competition between agents and , in turn , be influenced by it as well . within the evolutionary game theory framework ,",
    "after several sparse , early attempts to include mobility  @xcite , it was only recently that the interest in the combined effects of mobility and cooperation in the pd game had a significant increase .",
    "some level of information processing capability is required , for example , when the movement is strategy dependent  @xcite or driven by payoff  @xcite , success  @xcite or the neighborhood composition  @xcite .",
    "however , the simplest scenario is when mobility is diffusive  @xcite . indeed , as hypothesized in ref .",
    "@xcite , random mobility may have evolved prior to contingent mobility , allowing bacteria to move away from each other while exploring new resources .",
    "our previous results on a lattice  @xcite show that even in the framework of random , noncontingent mobility of unconditional agents , diffusion is favorable to cooperation , under rather broad conditions , if velocities are not too high .",
    "analogous conclusions , attesting the robustness of the results , were also found in off - lattice models  @xcite .    when diffusion occurs on a lattice and the one agent per site constraint holds , this area exclusion couples the diffusivity of the agents with the free area .",
    "this dependence on density , on the other hand , is not immediately present in off - lattice systems with point - like particles  @xcite .",
    "moreover , while on a lattice the number of simultaneous interactions is limited by its coordination number , there is no such restriction on the number of point - like particles within the range of interaction in off - lattice systems ( unless it is explicitly included as in ref .",
    "a relevant question concerns the universal effects of such geometrical hindrance on the emergence and persistence of cooperation .",
    "for example , letting the average body size be a coevolving trait , there may be some evolutive pressure for not too small cooperators because , assuming random diffusion , a group of small individuals will more easily evaporate from the cluster surface",
    ". they should not be too large either and , consequently , not be able to evade defectors and avoid exploitation .",
    "analogously , for defectors , they should neither be too small in order to stay closer to their prey for longer periods , nor too large so new , more promising regions will not be explored .",
    "therefore , one intuitively expects that intermediate , optimal sizes may be beneficial to cooperation and thus be selected for .",
    "another possible interpretation for an exclusion zone around each agent is its protected region , and the resources within .",
    "whatever the interpretation , it is important to better understand the relevance of area exclusion in these games . as a first approximation",
    ", we consider an effective radius of exclusion , modeled as a hard disk . here",
    "we study , by explicitly taking into account the excluded area of the agents , the interplay between geometry , density and mobility on the capability of a simple model to sustain cooperation and the question of whether the transitions in this class of model have a geometric interpretation .",
    "although the connection between the threshold of geometric percolation , that is independent of the game dynamics , and cooperation has already been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , we also explore the geometry of clusters of cooperators and defectors , and the connection between their critical properties and the transition between regions with and without cooperation , thus providing a geometric interpretation of these transitions .",
    "we study an off - lattice model  @xcite in which the @xmath3 agents living in a square of side @xmath4 ( with periodic boundary conditions ) are characterized by an unconditional strategy ( cooperate , c , or defect , d ) and two independent geometric parameters : an interaction radius @xmath1 and a hard disk radius @xmath0 to account for excluded area .",
    "the radius @xmath1 determines the neighborhood of each agent and , as a consequence , its instantaneous contact network .",

    "when @xmath21 there is no mobility and we consider here that @xmath22 is small enough so that jumps over other agents do not occur . under mutual cooperation ( defection ) , both receive payoff @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) as a reward ( punishment ) ; if one cooperates and the other defects , then the latter receives @xmath25 ( temptation ) and the former , @xmath26 . to characterize the pd",
