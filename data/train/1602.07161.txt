    "in 1969 the falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) @xcite was introduced for describing smb@xmath0 and its semiconductor - to - metal transition .",
    "falicov and kimball considered fully immobile , sm-@xmath1 electrons , interacting with mobile conduction electrons .",
    "nowadays we know that the fkm does not describe the kondo physics that is so important for metallic @xmath1-electron systems since it requires at least a minimal @xmath1-electron mobility or spin - flip . since plischke @xcite also showed that the paramagnetic metal - insulator transition in the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) is a smooth crossover rather than a phase transition , interest in the fkm faded in the 1970s .",
    "interest resurfaced in the 1980s when it was realized @xcite that the fkm is a simplified version of the hubbard model @xcite and arguably the simplest model for electronic correlations .",
    "this often allows for analytical solutions .",
    "an important analytical result was achieved in 1986 when brandt and schmidt @xcite and , independently , kennedy and lieb @xcite proved that there is a phase transition towards a checkerboard charge density wave ( cdw ) of the mobile and , antithetically , immobile electrons for dimension @xmath2 .",
    "freericks and coworkers showed rigorously that alongside the cdw there is phase separation in the limit of small @xcite and large interaction strength @xcite .",
    "the dawn of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite saw a further rapid development for the fkm . among others , brandt and mielsch @xcite solved the paramagnetic fkm exactly within dmft or for dimension @xmath3 ; van dongen and vollhardt @xcite studied cdw order ; freericks and miller @xcite determined dynamical and transport properties ; and jani proved the equivalence to the cpa solution of the fkm.@xcite for a concise review of the dmft results we refer the reader to ref .   by freericks and zlati .",
    "the fkm remains an interesting physical model for mixed valence systems and binary alloys , and an ideal testbed for analytical results and new approaches .",
    "regarding the latter , we have seen considerable efforts to include non - local correlations beyond dmft .",
    "these started with the @xmath4 approach @xcite and cluster extensions of dmft @xcite and have been applied to the fkm by schiller@xcite and hettler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "more recently , diagrammatic extensions of dmft became the focus of this methodological development .",
    "these extensions start with a local two - particle vertex @xcite and from this construct the local dmft correlations as well as non - local correlations beyond .",
    "different flavours of these diagrammatic approaches are the dynamical vertex approximation ( d@xmath5a ) @xcite , cf . ref .   , the dual fermion ( df ) approach @xcite and non - local expansion @xcite , the one - particle irreducible approach ( 1pi ) , @xcite the merger of dmft with the functional renormalization group ( dmf@xmath6rg ) @xcite , the triply - irreducible local expansion @xcite and dmft+fluctuation exchange ( flex ) @xcite .",
    "diagrammatic extensions of the cpa on the basis of the parquet approach have been introduced in ref .  .",
    "among others , these approaches allowed to calculate the critical exponents in the hubbard model @xcite and fkm @xcite . in agreement with the expectation from universality , these exponents are of heisenberg- and ising - type , respectively .    in the present paper",
    ", we derive an analytical expression for the full vertex of the mobile electrons , including its matsubara frequency @xmath7 component , for the irreducible vertices in the particle - hole and particle - particle channel as well as for the fully irreducible vertex , employing the parquet equation . the vertices irreducible in given channels",
    "have been known before , see e.g.  ref .  .",
    "these local vertices of the dmft solution are the starting point of the aforementioned diagrammatic extensions of dmft , and hence an analytical expression is most valuable . here , we employ the ladder series in the particle - hole channel to derive analytical expressions for the df and 1pi self - energy .",
    "we present explicit results for the paramagnetic self - energy and spectral function when approaching the cdw transition of the two dimensional falicov - kimball model and discuss the differences between df and 1pi .",
    "our results for the spectral evolution complement the pioneering work by antipov _",
    "@xcite which focused instead on the df critical exponents for the cdw phase transition .",
    "let us also mention the seminal work by jani and pokorn@xcite and pokorn and jani@xcite studying vertex corrections to the conductivity .",
    "+ in section [ sec : localvertexad ] we present the expressions for the local , dmft vertices : the full vertex , the irreducible vertices in the particle - hole and particle - particle channel and the fully irreducible one .",
    "this is supplemented in section [ numresdmft ] by numerical results for these vertices at two different interaction strengths . from these local dmft vertices",
    "we calculate in section [ andercorter ] the df and 1pi self - energy which includes non - local correlations beyond dmft .",
    "section [ numres2d ] shows numerical results obtained this way for the two - dimensional falicov - kimball model .",
    "finally , section [ conclusio ] summarizes our main findings .",

    "interestingly , in the 1pi results we find a four - peak structure . while it is difficult to exclude irrevocably that this feature is not an artifact of the analytic continuation , we find that the four - peak structure is rather stable and present also for different parameter sets close to the cdw transition of dmft",
