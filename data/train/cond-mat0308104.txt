    "the creation of superconducting @xcite and superfluid @xcite weak links has led to the experimental observation of josephson effects @xcite , arising as a result of macroscopic quantum phase coherence .",
    "josephson weak links are typically created by connecting two initially independent systems ( superconductors / superfluids ) via a barrier with dimensions of the order of the system healing length . such junctions lead to a variety of interesting phenomena @xcite , such as dc- and ac - josephson effects , shapiro resonances , macrosopic quantum self - trapping and @xmath0-phase oscillations .",
    "observations in superconductors preceded those in superfluids , due to the much larger healing lengths , thus enabling easier fabrication of weak links .",
    "evidence for josephson - like effects has been observed in @xmath1he weak links @xcite , and unequivocally demonstrated for weakly - coupled @xmath2he systems @xcite .",
    "the recent achievement of dilute trapped atomic bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite gives rise to a new system for studying josephson effects .",
    "in particular , such systems enable the investigation of dynamical regimes not easily accessible with other superconducting or superfluid systems .",
    "the simplest atomic josephson junction can be realized by a condensate confined in a double - well potential . to allow control of the tunnelling rate , such",
    "a system can be constructed by raising a barrier within a harmonic trap containing an atomic condensate ; this can be achieved by the application of a far - off - resonant blue - detuned laser beam , which induces a repulsive gaussian barrier @xcite .",
    "atomic interferometry based on such a set - up was recently reported @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a condensate can be created directly in a magnetic double - well structure @xcite .",
    "remarkable experimental progress has led to the creation of atomic bec josephson junction arrays , in which the harmonically trapped atoms are additionally confined by an optical lattice potential , generated by far - detuned laser beams .",
    "phase coherence in different wells was observed by interference experiments of condensates released from the lattice @xcite .",
    "in addition , josephson effects @xcite and the control of tunnelling rate has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "although experiments ( and theoretical analysis ) of such systems are well underway , deeper insight into the diverse range of josephson phenomena can be obtained by looking at the simplest single junction , double - well system .",
    "this system has already received considerable theoretical attention , with treatments based on a two - state approximation @xcite , zero temperature mean field theory @xcite , quantum phase models @xcite and instanton methods @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on a double - well atomic bec , and investigates the conditions under which the josephson current can be engineered to flow in a direction opposite to that minimizing the potential energy .",
    "this phenomenon bears close analogies to superconducting @xmath0-junctions @xcite , in which a macroscopic phase difference @xmath3 is maintained across the superconducting weak link .",
    "such behaviour has been observed in a variety of systems , as a consequence of different microscopic mechanisms .",
    "for example , @xmath0-junctions in ceramic superconductors have their origin in the symmetry of the order parameter @xcite , with their experimental detection being central to the understanding of high-@xmath4 superconductivity .",
    "@xmath0-junctions can also be created in ferromagnetic weak links @xcite , or by magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "recent interest has focused on the creation of controllable @xmath0-junctions in superconducting / normal - metal / superconducting links , in which the current direction can be reversed by the application of suitably large voltage across the link @xcite .",
    "the reversal originates from the fact that the addition of an extra phase factor @xmath0 is equivalent to reversing the sign of the current @xmath5 , since the superflow current obeys @xmath6 . a controllable @xmath0-squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) has been demonstated @xcite , and it is clear that the manipulation of multiple such @xmath0-junctions will be important in the domain of quantum electronics .",
    "for example , an array of alternating @xmath7 junctions allows the spontaneous generation of half - integer flux quanta .",
    "such a circuit of multiple successive @xmath8-@xmath0 junctions has been recently created between thin films of high-@xmath4 and low-@xmath4 superconductors @xcite , generating a one - dimensional array of josephson contacts with alternating signs of current .",
    "the superfluid analogue of a supeconducting @xmath0-junction is a metastasble @xmath0-state .",
    "this was recently observed in @xmath2he weak links @xcite upon exciting the system by an oscillating driving force .",
    "atomic bec junctions behave similarly to those of @xmath2he . for example , in the usual manner of considering mechanical analogs of josephson junctions , superconducting josephson junctions can be mapped onto a rigid pendulum , whereas atomic tunnel junctions ( @xmath2he , bec ) map onto a non - rigid pendulum @xcite , thus exhibiting richer oscillation modes .",
    "this model has been used to discuss so - called @xmath0 oscillations @xcite and their stability in atomic bec s @xcite , while such states have also been shown to arise within the framework of an exact quantum phase model @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the circumstances under which one can reverse the direction of the atomic current across a suitably - prepared condensate - condensate weak link , by the application of a linear potential gradient .",
    "we find that a bec confined in a double well configuration can , for small values of the potential gradient , move towards the higher potential well , a phenomenon henceforth referred to as josephson counterflow .",
    "although such josephson counterflow bears close analogies to the behaviour observed in superconducting weak links , we should point out that the counterflow discussed in this paper is ` global ' ( i.e. flow of entire quantum gas in opposite direction ) , as opposed to ` local ' counterflow ( i.e. across a single junction ) in a superconducting 0-@xmath0 junction .",
    "this paper discusses in detail the phenomenon of josephson counterflow for the lowest state exhibiting such behaviour , namely the anti - symmetric first excited @xmath0-state , which is most amenable to experimental observation .",
    "atomic counterflow dynamics are investigated in terms of experimentally relevant parameters , such as interaction strength , harmonic trap aspect ratio and gaussian barrier geometry .",
    "our analysis is based on numerical simulations of the gross - pitaevskii equation in three dimensions and leads to the conclusion that there exists a realistic window of parameters in which atomic josephson counterflow can be experimentally observed .",
    "this effect is found to be only weakly dependent on the strength of the interactions and can , in prinicple , be observed for both attractive and repulsive condensates .",
    "one should note the distinction between the @xmath0-state considered in this paper which is a time - independent solution , as opposed to the @xmath0 oscillations which arise as a result of a superposition of ground and first excited states . in an experimental realization",
    ", it may be difficult to create a pure @xmath0-state , and the system may experience a combination of counterflow and @xmath0-oscillations . in this paper",
    "we show that , by careful initial state preparation , one can decouple the timescales for these two effects , and even induce counterflow in a direction opposite to that of @xmath0-oscillations , thus demonstrating the different origin of these two phenomena .",
    "note that josephson counterflow has already been predicted in condensates trapped in optical lattices , as a result of the renormalization of the mass in the lattice , based on bloch wave analysis @xcite .",

    "optimum choice of parameters is an interplay between good experimental resolution for detecting few hundred to few thousand atoms , and the maximum observation time for which this effect is not affected by other dephasing processes .",
    "it is important to stress that appearance of this effect is not dependent on sign , and only weakly - dependent on strength of the scattering length , applying equally well to both attractive and repulsive bose - einstein condensates .",
    "an alternative suitable candidate for observing counterflow might also be found in the recently realized atom chips @xcite , which offer excellent control and experimental resolution .",
    "investigation in these low dimensional systems should enable observation of jospehson counterflow , since we have found this effect to be only weakly dependent on aspect ratio of the harmonic trap .",
    "we believe that the experimental observation of this phenomenon will further strengthen the analogies between atomic bec s and other states exhibiting macroscopic phase coherence and controllable josephson effects .",
