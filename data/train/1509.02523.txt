    "when the first galaxies emerged @xmath4 million years after the big bang , their starlight reionized and heated the intergalactic hydrogen that had existed since cosmological recombination .",
    "much is currently unknown about this process , including what spatial structure it had , when it started and completed , and even which sources drove it .",
    "the ly@xmath0 forest provides one of the only robust constraints on this process , showing that it was at least largely complete by @xmath5 , when the universe was one billion years old @xcite .",
    "this letter argues that there exists another , potentially groundbreaking signature of reionization in the ly@xmath0 forest data .    the amount of absorption in the ly@xmath0 forest can be quantified by the effective optical depth , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 $ ] is the transmitted fraction of a quasar s flux",
    ", @xmath8 indicates an average over a segment of the forest of length @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the optical depth in ly@xmath0 at location @xmath11 along a sightline .",
    "the optical depth , @xmath10 , scales approximately as the h  i  number density , which after reionization scales as @xmath12 . here",
    ", @xmath13 is temperature , @xmath14 is the gas density in units of the cosmic mean , and @xmath15 is the h  i  photoionization rate , which scales with the amplitude of the local ionizing radiation background .",
    "observations of high-@xmath16 quasars show a steep increase in the dispersion of @xmath17 among coeval forest segments around @xmath18 @xcite . in the limit of a uniform ionizing background ,",
    "the well - understood fluctuations in @xmath19 fall well short of producing the observed dispersion at @xmath20 , as shown recently by @xcite ( hereafter b2015 ) .",
    "previous studies have attempted to explain this excess with spatial fluctuations in the ionizing background .",
    "the properties of spatial fluctuations in the background depend on the number density of sources and the mean free path of photons , @xmath21 . while @xmath21 is well constrained at @xmath22 , being too large to yield significant background fluctuations for standard source models @xcite , b2015 showed that the excess @xmath17 dispersion at @xmath23 could be matched in a model where @xmath21 decreases by a factor of @xmath24 between @xmath25 and @xmath23  a time scale of just @xmath26 million years .",
    "however , such rapid evolution in @xmath21 is inconsistent with extrapolations based on measurements at lower redshifts @xcite , and would imply that the emissivity of ionizing sources , in turn , increases by an unnatural factor of @xmath24 over the same cosmologically short time interval .",
    "because of these issues , b2015 speculated that the excess dispersion was evidence for large spatial variations in the mean free path .",
    "alternatively , fluctuations in the ionizing background could have been enhanced if the sources of ionizing photons were rarer than the observed population of galaxies",
    ". however , current models require half of the background to arise from bright sources with an extremely low space density of @xmath27@xcite . this scenario is a possibility of current debate ( e.g. * ? ? ? * but see daloisio et al . in prep . ) .    in this letter",
    ", we explore a source of dispersion in @xmath17 that has so far been neglected and that , unlike ionizing background fluctuations , has straightforward implications for the reionization process itself .",
    "in addition to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the ly@xmath0 opacity depends on @xmath28 , mainly because the amount of neutral hydrogen after reionization is proportional to the recombination rate , which scales as @xmath29 .",
    "previous attempts to model ly@xmath0 opacity fluctuations had not included the residual temperature fluctuations that must have been present if reionization were patchy and temporally extended . as ionization fronts propagated supersonically through the igm , the gas behind them was heated to tens of thousands of degrees kelvin by photoionizations of h  i  and he  i. after reionization , the gas cooled mainly through adiabatic expansion and through inverse compton scattering with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons @xcite . since different regions in the igm were reionized at different times , these heating and cooling processes imprinted an inhomogeneous distribution of intergalactic temperatures that persisted after reionization @xcite .",
    "we will show that these residual temperature variations likely account for much of the observed dispersion in @xmath17 at @xmath30 , and may even account for all of it  a scenario that would yield new information on the timing , duration , and patchiness of reionization .",
    "the remainder of this letter is organized as follows . in  [ sec : methods ] and  [ sec : toymodel ] , we describe our simulations and methodology . in  [ sec : results ] , we present our main results . in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we offer concluding remarks .",
    "we use comoving units for distances and physical units for number densities .",
    "to model the impact of relic temperature fluctuations from reionization on the distribution of @xmath17 , we ran a suite of 20 cosmological hydrodynamics simulations using a modified version of the code of @xcite .",
    "the simulations were initialized at @xmath31 from a common cosmological initial density field .",
    "we used a matter power spectrum generated by camb @xcite assuming a flat @xmath32cdm model with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , consistent with recent measurements @xcite .",
    "our production runs use a cubical box with side length @xmath39 , with @xmath40 dark matter particles and @xmath41 gas cells .    in each simulation",
    ", reionization was modeled in a simplistic manner by instantaneously ionizing and heating the gas to a temperature @xmath42 at a redshift of @xmath43 .",
    "subsequently , ionization was maintained with a homogeneous background with spectral index @xmath44 , consistent with recent post - reionization background models @xcite . utilizing the periodic boundary conditions of our simulations",
    ", we trace skewers of length @xmath45 ( following the convention of the b2015 @xmath17 measurements ) at random angles through all of the hydro simulation snapshots .",
    "each skewer is divided into @xmath46 equally spaced velocity bins of size @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 is the cosmological scale factor ) , and ly@xmath0 optical depths are computed using the method of @xcite .",
    "although reionization occurs instantaneously at @xmath43 within each simulation box , we piece together skewer segments from simulations with different @xmath43 to model the effect of an inhomogeneous reionization process , as we describe further in the next section .",
    "the post - reionization temperatures in the simulations are relatively insensitive to the spectrum of the ionizing background , but they are sensitive to the amount of heating that is assumed to occur at the time a gas parcel is reionized .",
    "previous calculations @xcite have bracketed the range of possible reionization temperatures to @xmath49 k. ( we note that previous large - scale reionization simulations do not accurately capture @xmath42 , as they do not resolve the @xmath50 physical kpc ionization fronts . ) thus , we have run two sets of ten simulations ",
    "one set with @xmath51 k and the other with @xmath52 k  where each set contains instantaneous reionization redshifts of @xmath53 .",
    "this redshift range spans the likely duration of reionization .",
    "simulations with @xmath54 are driven to a common temperature by @xmath55 , so they are well approximated by the @xmath56 simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : physics ] shows the post - reionization thermal and associated hydrodynamic relaxation of intergalactic gas ( and its effect on the ly@xmath0 forest opacity ) in our simulations .",
    "the top - left panel shows the volume - weighted average gas temperature in the ten @xmath52 k simulations .",
    "the bottom - left panel shows this same average , but limited to gas cells with densities of @xmath57 , the deepest voids that dominate transmission in the highly - saturated @xmath58 forest . even at @xmath59 ,",
    "the @xmath60 gas temperatures differ by up to a factor of five between the simulations that were reionized at different times .",
    "the right panels show the h  i  number densities ( top ) and the transmission ( bottom ) at @xmath61 for the same skewer through our @xmath56 ( blue / solid ) and @xmath62 ( red / dashed ) simulations .",
    "the transmission is nearly zero in the @xmath56 case , owing to colder temperature and hence enhanced h  i  densities , whereas there is significant transmission in the @xmath62 case .",
    "reionization is a process that is inhomogeneous and temporally extended , unlike in our individual hydro simulations .",
    "modeling the thermal imprint of patchy reionization on the ly@xmath0 forest thus requires an additional ingredient : a model for the redshifts at which points along our skewers are reionized . in this section",
    ", we present a simplified toy model to illustrate how we piece together skewer segments from our hydro simulations , and to provide insight into how the timing , duration and morphology of reionization affect the amplitude of ly@xmath0 opacity fluctuations .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "let us assume that the ly@xmath0 forest is made up of segments of equal length , @xmath63 , where each segment is reionized at a single redshift .",
    "let us further assume that the reionization redshift of each segment is drawn from a uniform probability distribution over the interval @xmath64 $ ] , resulting in a global reionization history in which the mean ionized fraction , @xmath65 , is linear in redshift ( since @xmath65 is the cumulative probability distribution of the reionization redshift ) .    assuming that the reionization redshift field is in the hubble flow , each segment of length @xmath63 spans @xmath66 velocity bins of our hydro simulation skewers .",
    "for the first segment , with reionization redshift @xmath67 , we take the initial @xmath68 spectrum velocity bins of a randomly drawn skewer that has @xmath43 closest to @xmath67 . for the next segment , with reionization redshift @xmath69",
    ", we take the next @xmath68 velocity bins _ from the same skewer _ through the simulation that has @xmath43 closest to @xmath69 ( note that all simulations were started from the same initial density field ) .",
    "we repeat this procedure until an entire @xmath70 sightline is filled .    in",
    "what follows , we compare these toy models against the b2015 measurements of the cumulative probability distribution function of @xmath17 , @xmath71 .",
    "the measurements considered here span @xmath72 in bins of width @xmath73 .",
    "we construct @xmath71 from 4000 randomly drawn sightlines at the central redshift of each bin . for each redshift , we rescale the nominal post - reionization photoionization rate of our simulations ( @xmath74 ) by a constant factor , such that our model @xmath71 is equal to the observed distribution at either @xmath75 or @xmath76 , depending on which value provides the better visual fit .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical convergence tests using simulations of varying resolution and box size .",
    "we found excellent convergence of @xmath71 for our production runs in both box size and resolution ( especially for our patchy reionization models ) .     in our toy model ( colored curves )",
    "compared to the b2015 measurements ( black histograms ) and to an instantaneous reionization model with @xmath77 ( black / dotted curves ) .",
    "* top row : * varying the coherence length , @xmath78 , assuming a uniform @xmath43 probability between @xmath79 . *",
    "bottom row : * varying the redshift interval over which the @xmath43 values are drawn , assuming @xmath80 . , width=340 ]    figure [ fig : toymodel_cdfs ] shows the @xmath71 of these toy models for a range of @xmath81 , compared against the b2015 measurements in the two highest redshift bins ( black histograms ) .",
    "the curves with shorter reionization durations , or with smaller @xmath63 , fall closer to the black / dotted curves , which assume that reionization occurs instantaneously ( at @xmath77 , although it does not depend on this choice ) .",
    "figure [ fig : toymodel_cdfs ] affords three insights : ( 1 ) the larger the coherence length , @xmath63 , over which gas shares a similar reionization redshift , the larger the spread in @xmath17 ; ( 2 ) the width of the observed @xmath71 can be fully accounted for only if reionization ended at @xmath82 and was well underway by @xmath2 ; ( 3 ) the maximal width is achieved by a late - ending ( @xmath83 ) and extended reionization model in which large contiguous segments ( @xmath84 ) of the ly@xmath0 forest were reionized at @xmath85 . in the next section ,",
    "we apply these insights to construct more realistic models of reionization that reproduce the observed width of @xmath71 .",
    "we generate physically - motivated reionization redshift fields using simulations based on the excursion - set model of reionization ( esmr ) @xcite , which has been shown to reproduce the ionization structure found in full radiative transfer simulations @xcite . in particular , our esmr uses a realization of the linear cosmological density field and a top hat in fourier space filter to generate a realization of reionization in a cubical box with side @xmath86 , sampled with @xmath87 cells . for details of the algorithm ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we use the simplest formulation of the esmr , with two free parameters : ( 1 ) the minimum mass of halos that host galactic sources of ionizing photons , @xmath88 ; ( 2 ) the ionizing efficiency of the sources , @xmath89 .",
    "we tune @xmath89 to obtain a reionization history that is approximately linear in redshift , similar to those in our toy model .",
    "the esmr calculation yields a cube of reionization redshifts .",
    "we construct mock absorption spectra by first tracing @xmath70 skewers through this cube .",
    "we then piece together spectrum segments from our suite of hydro simulations , much like in our toy model , except here we match @xmath43 to the reionization redshifts along the esmr skewers .",
    "this process does not account for how @xmath43 correlates with density , an effect that will underestimate ( making our models conservative ) the width of @xmath71 , which we address shortly .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : zreionfield ] shows a 2d slice through our fiducial reionization redshift field in which reionization spans @xmath90 . in the right panels ,",
    "the blue / solid curves show the fraction of transmitted flux along four different sightlines through this field , selected to span a range of @xmath17 .",
    "the red / dashed curves show the corresponding reionization redshifts along the sightlines . on average , regions that reionize at later times",
    "yield more transmission , while regions that reionize at @xmath85 result in dark gaps in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the variation among these mock spectra is similar to the well - known variation seen in observations of the @xmath3 ly@xmath0 forest @xcite . in our interpretation , this variation reflects differences in the reionization redshifts  and hence temperatures fluctuations . ]  between segments of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the leftmost four panels of figure [ fig : eps_cdfs ] show @xmath71 in three esmr models that take @xmath91 and @xmath92 , with reionization histories shown in the inset of the @xmath93 panel .",
    "the cmb electron scattering optical depths in these models are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , within uncertainties of the latest _ planck _ measurement of @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "these models are compared against the b2015 measurements ( black histograms ) and against the homogeneous reionization reference model with @xmath77 ( dotted curves ) .",
    "the blue / long - dashed and green / short - dashed curves correspond to scenarios in which reionization spans @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "while these two models produce significantly more width in @xmath71 than the homogeneous reionization model , they fall short of producing the full range of @xmath17 required to match the observations .",
    "however , the fiducial @xmath90 reionization model ( red / solid curves ) generally provides a good match to the measurements .",
    "a significant success of the fiducial model is that the observed redshift evolution of the @xmath71 width is reproduced without any additional tuning of parameters .",
    "( we have checked that this success also holds over @xmath99 , lower redshifts than those shown where the effect is reduced . ) indeed , there are not any parameters that can be tuned in our model to change the post - reionization evolution of the width .",
    "the pink shaded regions indicate the 90% confidence levels of our fiducial model , estimated from bootstrap realizations , showing consistency with all the data aside from a single high - opacity point at @xmath100 and at @xmath23 .    the discrepancy at the highest opacities may arise because our method of constructing mock absorption spectra does not capture correlations between temperature and density that should be present , since denser regions are more likely reionized earlier .",
    "such correlations would act to increase the width of @xmath71 , as the denser regions around galaxies are ionized earlier in our models .",
    "one might naively think these correlations are small , because correlations between the density on the much larger scales of the h  ii  bubbles and the smaller scales of voids in the forest should be weak , but calculations show that they may not be negligible @xcite      the right panels of figure [ fig : eps_cdfs ] show the effect of varying @xmath42 and @xmath88 . for @xmath101 ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath17 is somewhat narrower than the case with @xmath91 .",
    "hotter temperatures are likely achieved towards the end of reionization , when h  ii  bubbles are larger and propagate at quicker speeds .",
    "a model with @xmath102 near the end of reionization , and smaller temperatures earlier on , would likely produce more width than a model with @xmath102 at all times .",
    "however , any conclusions about @xmath42 prior to modeling the density / reionization - redshift correlations are premature .",
    "the blue / long - dashed and green / short - dashed curves in the right panels show the effect of varying @xmath88 . for the former atomic cooling halos ( achs ) curve , @xmath103 is set to the minimum mass required to achieve a halo virial temperature of @xmath104 .",
    "for both curves , we tune @xmath89 to match the reionization history of our fiducial model ( red curve in the inset ) .",
    "we find that the effects of varying @xmath103 are minor .",
    "we have shown that residual temperature inhomogeneities from a patchy and extended reionization process likely account for much of the opacity fluctuations in the @xmath58 ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "inhomogeneities in the ionizing background may also contribute at a significant level , though current models in this vein have required very small mean free paths or extremely rare sources .",
    "we showed that residual temperature fluctuations alone could account for the entire spread of observed @xmath17 .",
    "a significant success of this interpretation is that it is able to reproduce the rapid growth of @xmath17 fluctuations with redshift , despite having very little freedom in its post - reionization evolution . in this scenario ,",
    "the observations favor a late but extended reionization process that is roughly half complete by @xmath2 and that ends at @xmath3 .",
    "unlike ionizing background fluctuations , which do not necessarily signal the end of reionization , temperature fluctuations directly probe the timing , duration , and patchiness of this process .",
    "if most of the opacity variations owe to temperature , it would mean that , on average , the darkest @xmath105 segments of the @xmath106 ly@xmath0 forest were reionized earliest , and the brightest segments last  a potentially powerful probe of cosmological reionization . + the authors acknowledge support from nsf grant ast1312724 . h.t .",
