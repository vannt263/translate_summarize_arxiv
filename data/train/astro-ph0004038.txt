    "the rex survey is an effort aimed at the selection of a sizable , statistically complete sample of radio - emitting x - ray sources ( rexs ) .",
    "a detailed description of this survey has been presented in caccianiga et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in summary ,",
    "the rex survey is the result of a positional cross - correlation between the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) at 1.4 ghz and an x - ray catalog of about 17,000 serendipitous sources detected in 1202 pointed rosat pspc fields .",
    "the flux density limit in the radio band ( at 1.4 ghz ) is 5 mjy while in the x - ray band the flux limits range from @xmath03.5@xmath110@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 to @xmath02@xmath110@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 ( 0.52.0 kev ) .",
    "the area covered at the highest flux limit is about 2200 deg@xmath6 .",
    "the cross - correlation has produced a catalog of @xmath01600 rex sources .",
    "the spectroscopic observation of the rexs is in progress and , to date , the percentage of identifications is about 30% . among these sources ,",
    "232 emission line ( el ) objects ( mostly agns ) , 72 bl lacs and 176 optically `` non - active '' galaxies have been found . about 30% of these objects",
    "are newly discovered .",
    "a previous paper ( wolter et al . 1998 ) reported a small fraction of these new identifications ; in this paper we present the spectra of 71 el objects not included in wolter et al .",
    "in addition , we present other 19 el objects that were included in a preliminary version of the rex survey but not in the final catalog .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the optical observations , in section 3 we explain the criteria used for the classification of the el sources , in section 4 we discuss the general radio and x - ray properties of the el agns discovered so far in the rex survey .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 5 . throughout this paper",
    "we use h@xmath7=50  km @xmath8 mpc@xmath3 and q@xmath7=0 .",
    "several spectroscopic observations of rex sources have been carried out during the period 1995/1998 using the 88 \" telescope of the university of hawaii ( uh ) in mauna kea ( 5 observing runs ) , the 2.2 m and 3.6 m telescopes of eso in la silla ( 1 run ) and the unam 2.1 m telescope in s. pedro martir ( 3 runs ) .",

    "the spectra have been wavelength calibrated using an he - ar ( unam , eso ) or a hg - cd - zn ( uh ) reference spectrum .",

    "on average , the seeing during the observing runs ranged from 0.9  ( august 1996 , december 1996 , february 1998 ) to 1.5 .",
    "we have consequently used , except for few cases , a slit of 1.5 - 1.6  to maximize the signal .    in tables",

    "the objects without the prefix  rex \" in the name do not belong to the final rex catalog .",
    "the x - ray flux has been derived from the count - rate using the value of galactic n@xmath14 at the source position ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and assuming @xmath15=1 , which is the mean value expected for our sources .",
    "for some of the sources that are not in the final rex catalog , the x - ray flux has been computed from the count - rate found in the 1rxp catalog ( rosat news n.32 , 1994 ) , converted from the 0.1 - 2.4 kev to 0.5 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "these x - ray fluxes are indicated with an asterisk in tables  [ journal_mk ] ,  [ journal_eso ] and  [ journal_sp ] .",
    "the uncertainty on the x - ray fluxes is about 20% .",
    "the typical rms of the radio ( nvss ) maps is 0.45 mjy / beam .",
    "we note that in the case of objects in cluster or in group of galaxies the x - ray flux is the sum of the active nucleus plus the extended thermal component .",
    "given the available statistics and the spatial resolution of the pspc , particularly poor in the external part of the field , in most cases we are not able to distinguish the two components .",
    "we have evidence , from the optical images , that 4 objects belong to a cluster / group of galaxies : we believe that in these cases the x - ray luminosity is mainly due to the diffuse intracluster gas ( see sect .  3 ) .",
    "in this paper we present newly identified emission line objects .",
    "we define emission line objects those sources for which at least one strong ( ew@xmath165    in the source rest frame ) emission line is present in the spectrum .",
    "this criterium excludes bl lac objects and radiogalaxies without emission lines in their spectrum .",
    "there is evidence ( vermeulen et al . 1995 ; corbett et al .",
    "1996 ; march et al . 1996 ) that some `` true '' bl lacs might show emission lines with an equivalent width slightly larger than the  canonical \" limit of 5   , proposed by stocke et al .",
    "however , the majority of the objects presented here show very strong emission lines well above the limit of 5 .",
    "we further classify objects as broad emission line ( bel ) agns if at least one line has a fwhm@xmath171000 km / s ( in the source rest frame ) , or narrow emission line ( nel ) object if all the observed lines have fwhm@xmath18 1000 km / s .",
    "this classification reflects the common division between `` type 1 '' ( i.e. broad line ) and `` type 2 '' ( narrow line ) agns often discussed in literature .",
    "the majority of the el objects presented here is `` type 1 '' agns . in one case ( 1rexj213248@xmath190219.8 ) , the fwhm of h@xmath20 and h@xmath21 is @xmath01300 - 1400 km / s , thus slightly higher than the limit used to classify the object as nel agn .",
    "this value of fwhm and the ratio between [ oiii ] and h@xmath20 ( = 1.4 ) suggests a classification as narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxy ( nls1 , [ oiii]/h@xmath223 and fwhm@xmath182000 km / s , e.g. osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",
    "in the few cases of narrow line objects , we have applied , when possible , the diagnostic criteria described in veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) to separate a starburst galaxy from an agn or liner .",
    "however it is worth noting that , as discussed in veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) , the separation between starburst galaxies and agns is not very sharp and a mixture of both phenomena could be present in the same object ( hill et al .",
    "1999 ; goncalves et al . 1998 ) . given the quality of our spectra , we did nt attempt to estimate a correction for reddening .",
    "however , for the classification of these objects we have used , as long as possible , the ratios between couples of emission lines like [ oiii]@xmath235007/h@xmath20 , [ nii]@xmath236583/h@xmath21 , [ sii]@xmath236716+@xmath236731/h@xmath21 that are not very reddening sensitive .    we briefly discuss here the 4 nel objects for which we can apply the veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) diagnostic criteria .    * 1rexj005924 + 2703.5 * : the values of the ratios between [ sii]@xmath236716+@xmath236731 and h@xmath21 ( log([sii]/h@xmath21 ) = 0.29 ) and between [ oiii]@xmath235007 and h@xmath20 ( log([oiii]/h@xmath20 ) = 0.02 )",
    "put this object in the zone intermediate between agns and hii regions .",
    "* 1rexj022840 - 0935.2 * : the intensity ratio between [ oiii]@xmath235007 and h@xmath20 ( log([oiii]/h@xmath20 ) = 0.26 ) and between [ nii]@xmath236583 and h@xmath21 ( log([nii]/h@xmath21 ) = 0.9 ) suggests a classification as h  ii region or starburst galaxy rather than agn for this object .    *",
    "1rexj121815 + 0744.4 * : the h@xmath21 is blended with [ nii]@xmath236548 and it is difficult to measure its width .",
    "the fwhm is about 800 - 1000 km / s . the strong intensity of the [ oiii]@xmath235007 line if compared with the h@xmath20 ( log([oiii]/h@xmath20 ) = 0.88 ) and the ratio between [ sii]@xmath236716+@xmath236731 and h@xmath21 ( log([sii]/h@xmath21 ) = 0.37 ) strongly suggest the presence of an agn .",
    "* 1rexj230311 - 0859.3 * : the h@xmath21 is blended with [ nii]@xmath236583 .",
    "the fwhm of the h@xmath21 is about 1000  km / s although a proper de - blending is necessary for a more accurate measurement .",
    "the measured value of log([n ii]@xmath236583/h@xmath21)@xmath00.15 and the lack of [ sii]@xmath236716+@xmath236731 lines lead to a tentative classification of this source as narrow emission line galaxy ( nelg ) .",
    "this object belongs to a galaxy pair .    for the remaining 4 nel objects ( 1rexj041734 - 1154.5 , 1rexj220451 - 1815.5",
    ", 1rexj235139 - 2605.0 , j014716 - 0008.2 ) we can not apply the diagnostic criteria described above .",
    "these objects typically show [ oii]@xmath233727 and [ oiii]@xmath235007 lines .",
    "all these 4 nel objects show an x - ray luminosity exceptionally high for this class of source ( l@xmath2410@xmath25 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "one of these sources , 1rexj235139 - 2605.0 , is the cd galaxy of the cluster a 2667 which is very luminous in the x - ray band ( 2.1@xmath110@xmath26 erg s@xmath3 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band , rizza et al .",
    "in other two cases ( 1rexj041734 - 1154.5 , 1rexj220451 - 1815.5 ) the ccd image taken at the uh 88  telescope reveals the presence of an overdensity of galaxies around ( @xmath18 1@xmath27 ) the radio source thus suggesting that these objects belong to a cluster / group of galaxies .",
    "finally , j014716 - 0008.2 is probably in a cluster since at least two companions at the same redshift of the radio source , have been found . in conclusion , all the nel objects presented in this paper with an x - ray luminosity greater than 10@xmath25 erg s@xmath3 probably belong to a cluster / group of galaxies . in these cases ,",
    "the very high x - ray luminosity is probably originated from the intracluster gas and not from the galaxy itself .",
    "further x - ray observations with higher spatial resolution are required in order to measure the true luminosity of the object . on the contrary ,",
    "all the isolated nel objects have a low luminosity in the radio and in the x - ray band ( l@xmath282@xmath110@xmath29 erg s@xmath3 , l@xmath3010@xmath31 erg s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 ) .",
    "the classification of the el objects in broad line ( b ) and narrow line ( n ) objects is reported in table  [ results ] ( column 2 ) together with the measured redshift and the relative confidence ( column 3 and 4 ) , x - ray and radio luminosities ( columns 5 and 6 ) , the observed features in emission ( column 7 ) and in absorption ( column 8) .",
    "the luminosities have been computed and k - corrected under the assumption of power - law spectra ( f@xmath32 ) . in the radio band we have used the spectral index ( @xmath33 ) as computed between 1.4  ghz ( nvss ) and 5  ghz if the source is included in the gb6 ( gregory & condon , 1991 ) or in the pmn ( griffith & wright , 1993 ) catalog . for three sources ( 1rexj061757 + 7816.1 , 1rexj082656 + 6542.5 , 1rexj085211 + 7627.3 ) not present in the gb6 and pmn catalogs ,",
    "we have used the flux at 365  mhz derived from the wenss survey ( rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) to estimate the radio spectral index .",
    "finally , if no fluxes at frequencies different from 1.4  ghz are available , we have used the lower limit on @xmath21 computed taking into account the proper flux density limit at 5  ghz for the gb6 ( @xmath0 18  mjy ) and pmn catalogs ( from 40 to 72  mjy depending on the declination ) .",
    "these monochromatic luminosities ( indicated by an asterisk in table  [ results ] ) should be considered as lower limits .",
    "the actual value of the luminosity is close to these values for low - redshift objects ( z@xmath180.5 ) while it can change up to a factor of 10 for those sources at z@xmath171 .    in the x - ray band ,",
    "the assumption of @xmath15=1 is adequate to convert the count - rate into an x - ray flux ( error less than 20% ) but it is not good enough for the k - correction , in particular for high redshift objects .",
    "thus , we have used the relationships found in brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that give the @xmath15 as a function of the redshift for a sample of x - ray selected radio - loud agns found in the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "in particular , we have used the appropriate relationship for steep spectrum ( ss , @xmath340.5 ) and flat spectrum ( fs , @xmath350.5 ) radio sources given in brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) on the basis of the radio slope between 1.4  ghz and 5  ghz .",
    "if a radio slope is not available , we have used the relationship between @xmath15 and z proper for the ss , if the lower limit on @xmath33 ( based on the gb6 or pmn flux limits ) is larger than 0.5 ; otherwise , we have used the formula for the fs .",
    "the used values of @xmath15 range from 0.8 to 1.15 .",
    "a separate table ( table  [ not_rex ] ) contains the el objects that are not included in the final version of the rex catalog .",
    "these sources have been excluded because they do not satisfy anymore the final selection criteria of the rex survey described in caccianiga et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we note that the spectra presented here have been collected with the primary aim of identifying the sources and measuring the redshifts .",
    "the nominal error on the redshift is @xmath00.001 ( at 5000 ) but in many cases , given the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum , the error is larger ( about 0.005 - 0.01 ) . when only one strong emission line is present in the spectrum , we have assumed , as usual , that this feature is the mgii@xmath232798 .",
    "we have flagged as _ tentative _ the values of redshift computed in these cases ( a letter `` t '' after the value of redshift in table  [ results ] and [ not_rex ] ) .",
    "we have also flagged as _ tentative _ the redshift of 1rexj220451@xmath191815.5 for which we have assumed that the two observed features are [ oii]@xmath233737 and [ oiii]@xmath235007 respectively .",
    "all the sources presented here were unidentified when we observed them . during the preparation of this paper , 12 sources",
    "have been observed and identified independently by other authors , in particular during the identification of other surveys that combine x - ray and radio data ( i.e. the dxrbs survey , perlman et al .",
    "1998 and the rgb survey , laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "moreover , in two additional cases we have intentionally re - observed the object because the redshift was based on poor quality data ( i.e. low dispersion prism observations , 1rexj0052293743.8 ) or we wanted to assess the presence of the @xmath36 in emission ( 1rexj2303110859.3 ) . except for 1rexj0052293743.8 , for which we have found a redshift significantly different from the one published ( 1.60 instead of 2.25 ) , in all the other cases we confirm the published values of redshift , with discrepancies below 3% and only in one case of 6% .",
    "a footnote in the source name in table  [ results ] and [ not_rex ] indicates that an optical identification and a redshift for that object have been already published in literature .    in fig .",
    "[ sp_rex ] and  [ sp_nrex ] we present the spectra of all the el objects included ( fig .",
    "[ sp_rex ] ) and not included ( fig .  [ sp_nrex ] ) in the rex catalog . the y axis ( the flux )",
    "has arbitrary units .",
    "although the objects presented here do not represent a complete sample , since the optical identification of the rex survey is still in progress , it is interesting to investigate what kind of agns is selected by combining an x - ray and a radio survey . in order to increase the statistics , we have used for this analysis all the emission line agns discovered in the rex survey so far . in particular , from the 232 el objects available , we have selected the 226 with a firm determination of redshift .",
    "the majority of the objects identified from literature is composed by qsos , i.e. type 1 objects .",
    "for the low - redshift objects the situation is less clear in particular if we want to apply uniformly the same criteria used for the sources observed by us .",
    "for this reason , in the following analysis we will not distinguish between narrow and broad emission line objects .",
    "for all these sources we have computed the ratio ( _ r _ ) of the integrated to the peak nvss flux densities , resulting from the gaussian fit to the image ( see condon et al .",
    "1998 for details ) ; _ r _ is a good indicator of the compactness of the source at the survey resolution . the majority ( 74% ) of the sources",
    "below 1.1 , i.e. they are unresolved in the nvss maps .",
    "we note , however , that the nvss survey has been carried out with the vla in the less resolved configuration ( dnc ) and , thus , the corresponding beam is quite large ( fwhm=45 ) .",
    "this beam , at redshift of 0.9 ( which is the mean z value of the 226 sources ) corresponds to a linear size of about 470  kpc .",
    "thus , even a typical lobe - dominated source at this redshift could be unresolved in the nvss .    in fig .",
    "[ alpha ] we have reported the histogram of the spectral indices of the 151 sources detected at 5  ghz in the gb6 or pmn catalog .",
    "ninety - four objects ( 62% ) are fs radio sources ( @xmath370.5 ) and 57 ( 38% ) are ss radio sources .",
    "since compact , flat spectrum radio sources have a higher probability of being detected at 5  ghz ( in the gb6 or pmn catalogs ) we expect that our distribution is biased against steep spectrum sources .",
    "for this reason we have considered the 59 sources with a flux density at 1.4  ghz greater than 200  mjy and falling in the area of sky covered by the gb6 catalog ( which is deeper than pmn ) : all these sources should be detectable at 5  ghz even if their radio spectrum is very steep ( @xmath38 2 ) .",
    "these sources , represented by the shaded area in fig .  [ alpha ] , are equally distributed between fs ( 51% ) and ss ( 49% ) radio sources .",
    "their average radio slope is 0.41 .",
    "the redshift distribution of the 226 agn is presented in fig .",
    "[ z ] . the majority ( 96% ) of the sources",
    "have a redshift below 2 .",
    "the mean value of z ( = 0.9 ) is the same found for the rl agn in the emss ( della ceca et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ lum ] we present the monochromatic radio luminosities at 1.4  ghz versus the x - ray luminosities in the 0.5 - 2.0  kev band .",
    "we have considered here only the 151 agns for which we have computed the radio spectral index in order to reduce the uncertainties on the determination of the k - corrected radio luminosity which could be large for high redshift objects .",
    "[ lum ] shows a rather strong correlation between the radio and the x - ray luminosities .",
    "a least squares fit to the data gives l@xmath39l@xmath40 ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ lum ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent ( within 2@xmath41 ) with a linear ( l@xmath39 l@xmath42 ) correlation between the two luminosities .",
    "the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient gives a highly significant probability ( @xmath1799.9% ) that the two luminosities are correlated .",
    "however , a spurious correlation between luminosities is often observed in flux - limited surveys , due to the artificial correlation between luminosities and redshift . since we do not see any evidence of a similar correlation between the radio and x - ray fluxes , it is possible that what we observe in fig",
    ".  [ lum ] is simply the result of a selection effect . in order to exclude the effect of redshift in the analysis of the correlation bewteen the luminosities",
    ", we have used the partial correlation analysis described in kendall & stuart ( 1979 ) . according to this method ,",
    "we have computed the correlation coefficient ( r@xmath43 ) between l@xmath42 and l@xmath44 excluding the dependence to the redshift in the following way :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the spearman rank - order correlation coefficients between l@xmath42/l@xmath44 , l@xmath42/z and l@xmath44/z respectively .",
    "the analysis gives r@xmath43=0.09 corresponding to a probability for the `` null hypothesis '' ( the two luminosities are unrelated ) of @xmath025% .",
    "thus , once excluded the dependence to the redshift , our data do not show any strong evidence of a significant correlation between the two luminosities .",
    "the distribution of x - ray luminosities is similar to that found for the rl agns in the emss ( della ceca et al .",
    "1994 ) and it is peaked at l@xmath42=5@xmath1 10@xmath49 erg s@xmath3 .    in fig .",
    "[ arox ] we report the radio - optical ( @xmath50 ) versus the x - ray - optical ( @xmath51 ) spectral indices of the 151 agns presented in fig .  [ lum ] .",
    "these indices are defined in the usual way ( e.g. stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) :    @xmath52    @xmath53    where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the k - corrected monochromatic flux densities at 5  ghz , 2500    and 2  kev respectively .",
    "the optical flux densities have been derived from the apm ( automatic plate measuring ) o ( blue ) magnitude assuming @xmath57=1 , while the monochromatic fluxes at 2  kev have been computed from the x - ray fluxes assuming @xmath15=1 . in the radio band",
    "we have used the flux density at 5  ghz from gb6 or pmn .",
    "about 88% of the sources have an @xmath580.35 , which is the typical limit used to define an object as `` radio - loud '' ( rl , e.g. della ceca et al .",
    "we have reported the spectra and the main properties of 90 el objects , 80 of which are newly discovered .",
    "seventy - one objects belong to a well defined sample of radio - emitting x - ray sources , the rex catalog ( caccianiga et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the majority of the objects presented here show broad ( fwhm@xmath171000 km / s ) emission lines in the optical spectrum while only 9% are type 2 sources , i.e. narrow emission line objects .",
    "except for three sources , all the objects presented in this paper are agns ( qsos , seyfert galaxies , emission line radiogalaxies ) .",
    "the sample contains two high redshift ( z=3.47 and 3.49 ) radio - loud agns .",
    "we have then studied the general properties of the 226 agns discovered so far in the rex sample , including sources identified from literature .",
    "we have analyzed their radio properties ( compactness and slope ) as deduced from the nvss data .",
    "on average , we select a similar number of ss and fs radio sources despite the fact that the selection has been done by using a relatively low frequency ( 1.4  ghz ) radio catalog . at this frequency , we would have expected a dominance of ss agns .",
    "the large number of fs agns found in this sample is probably due to the presence of the x - ray constraint that favors the selection of compact fs sources . on the other side ,",
    "the presence of a radio limit favors the selection of rl agns .",
    "in fact , the majority of these sources ( @xmath088% ) is radio loud while only a small percentage ( @xmath010% , della ceca et al .",
