    "the existence of some form of dark matter ( dm ) is well - established from its gravitational interactions .",
    "the coincidence that the standard model ( sm ) weak interactions roughly coincide with the coupling strength required for the thermal freeze - out of a weak scale particle to account for the observed relic abundance has driven a multipronged search for non - gravitational signals of dm , in direct detection experiments , in cosmic ray signals , and at colliders . over the last few years",
    "an excess of gamma rays over astrophysical predictions has been observed in the fermi - lat data in the direction of the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite .",
    "the extended and spherically symmetric spatial distribution , the overall rate , and the shape of the spectrum associated with the excess are strikingly consistent with an origin in annihilating dm . of course , astrophysical sources of the excess are still a possibility .",
    "millisecond pulsars have been proposed as a source for the excess @xcite ; however , such a population would have to be novel in both its spatial and luminosity distributions @xcite .",
    "in particular , the fact that the excess appears to extend well beyond the gc , out to at least around 10@xmath0 , is a challenge for the millisecond pulsar interpretation .",
    "it has also been suggested that the excess could be due to cosmic ray interactions with gas and dust @xcite , but similarly it has been argued that these explanations provide a poor fit to the data @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing features of the gc gamma ray excess is that if it is indeed due to dm , then it would establish the existence not only of dm but also of some new mediator particle responsible for its interaction with the sm .",
    "the spectrum of the excess has been fit well by dm annihilations @xmath1 , in which case the dm mass is @xmath2 30 gev ; annihilations @xmath3 provide a less good fit to the data and would point to lighter masses .",
    "intriguingly , with these hypotheses for the annihilation , the cross - section needed to achieve the rate seen in the excess is strikingly close to the thermal value : @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , this mass range for dm , @xmath5 gev , has been very well studied by direct detection experiments .",
    "the two sm particles capable of mediating @xmath6 are the higgs and the @xmath7 boson . with the coupling to dm set by the deduced cross - section @xmath8 , both the higgs and",
    "the @xmath7 would give rise to direct detection signals vastly in excess of observations .",
    "in addition , the failure to observe @xmath9 at the lhc independently eliminates the 125 gev higgs as a mediator for the dm annihilations .",
    "thus some beyond - the - sm field is required to mediate dm annihilations to the sm , whether heavy @xcite or light @xcite .",
    "other implications and aspects of model building have been considered in e.g.  @xcite .    in the present work we highlight the possibility that the mediator may easily be lighter than the dm , in which case dm",
    "will typically annihilate to pairs of on - shell mediators rather than directly to sm particles . in this case ,",
    "constraints from lhc and direct detection experiments can be almost entirely obviated @xcite .",
    "thermal freeze - out determines the coupling of dm to the mediators , but the coupling of the mediators @xmath10 to the sm is a free parameter .",
    "whilst the coupling of @xmath10 to the sm is constrained by collider and direct detection searches on one hand , and by the requirement that they decay before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) on the other , a wide range of values are still permitted by all available data .",

    "second , we consider the case where the mediator is a scalar , which couples to the sm via the higgs portal , and has branching fractions given at tree - level by the sm yukawa couplings .",
    "in our numerical work we use branching fractions computed by ` hdecay ` @xcite , including higher - order corrections and the loop - induced mode @xmath66 .",
    "finally , we consider the case where the mediator is a ( pseudo-)scalar coupling to the sm through the higher dimensional operators @xmath67 or @xmath68 , resulting in @xmath69 .",

    "if its origin from dm is confirmed , the gc gamma - ray excess will not only present the long - awaited detection of dm , but also provide evidence of a dark sector governing its interactions .",
    "the dm mass and thermal cross - section indicated by the excess is highly suggestive of a particle of mass @xmath197 tens of gev , freezing out via thermal annihilations mediated by a bsm particle , with a substantial component of the annihilation proceeding through the @xmath93-wave . for dm with this mass and this magnitude of coupling , the big challenge for models of dm",
    "is to reconcile the signal from the gc with the lack of any signal at direct detection experiments , especially lux .",
    "the deduced need for a bsm mediator naturally presents an elegant solution to this puzzle . when @xmath198 , the mediator itself is available as a final state for dm annihilations .",
    "a small coupling of the mediator to the sm subsequently allows the mediator to decay to sm particles with a cosmologically short lifetime .",
    "thus in this scenario the coupling of the dark sector to sm particles in general and to nucleons in particular is no longer tied to the thermal relic density of dm .",
    "this cascade annihilation scenario opens up the scope of possible masses and quantum numbers for both dm and the mediator .",
    "the photon spectra arising from cascade annihilations will be determined by the masses of the dm and mediator , together with the details of how the mediator decays .",
    "we have studied three well - motivated minimal scenarios for mediator decay : vector mediators decaying to the sm via hypercharge mixing ; scalar mediators decaying to the sm through higgs mixing ; and ( pseudo)-scalar mediators decaying to the sm via loops of heavy fermions . for all scenarios",
    "we establish the combinations of masses that lead to the best description of the gamma - ray spectrum , as determined in @xcite .",
    "we construct simple reference models for all of these scenarios and demonstrate that they are capable of explaining the gc excess whilst naturally eluding direct detection as well as collider limits .",
    "our best - fit scenarios are compared to the observations in fig .",
    "there is a large and natural range of parameter space in all of these models capable of explaining the excess .",
    "this ease in evading current experiments has the unfortunate consequence that signals of these models at direct detection and at colliders are naturally small , and may be difficult to observe at the lhc .",
    "exotic decays of quarkonia and of the sm higgs boson offer the best prospects for terrestrial experiments .",
    "astrophysical signals offer a window onto the complementary regime where the mediator has small couplings to the sm , via perturbations of bbn or the cmb via late - decaying particles .",
    "we have focused our attention on minimal models , with one dm particle and one mediator species active in the process of thermal freeze - out .",
    "less minimal choices of mediator - sm couplings may also be constructed .",
    "for instance , hidden vectors may be constructed that couple to the sm through leptophobic @xcite or leptophilic @xcite portals . in such cases the dm thermal freeze - out",
    "will generically proceed as computed in sect .",
    "[ s4 ] , but the constraints on the mediator couplings to the sm , as well as limits on the additional matter species that appear in such models , will impose different restrictions on the allowed parameter space .",
    "further , a much broader range of possible dm quantum numbers and interactions opens up if the mediator sector is allowed to be non - minimal , enabling such possibilities as mixed annihilations @xmath199 @xcite , longer cascades @xcite , or showering in a hidden sector .",
    "there are many opportunities for extending dm model building in these directions .",
    "we are grateful to dan hooper , robert lasenby , tim linden , torbjrn sjstrand , and tracy slatyer for useful discussions .",
    "note : preprints @xcite , which appeared in the process of finalising this work , consider complementary aspects of dm cascade annihilations .",
