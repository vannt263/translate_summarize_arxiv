    "at large densities , neutrino - neutrino refraction causes nonlinear flavor oscillation phenomena with sometimes perplexing results  @xcite . in the region between the neutrino sphere and a radius of about 400  km in core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) ,",
    "the neutrino flavor content evolves dramatically  @xcite .",
    "the global features of this self - induced transformation are equivalent to the motion of a gyroscopic pendulum in flavor space  @xcite .",
    "however , this picture does not explain the `` spectral splits '' that have been numerically observed in the transformed fluxes  @xcite . in a typical case ,",
    "the primary @xmath2 flux below a split energy @xmath1 emerges from the dense - neutrino region in its original flavor , whereas above @xmath3 , it is completely transformed to @xmath4 ( some mixture of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , the step at @xmath1 being very sharp .",
    "( to be specific we explore the @xmath2@xmath4 system with the atmospheric @xmath7 and the small 13-mixing angle . )    it has been suggested that an adiabatic transition from high to low neutrino density is the primary cause for the split  @xcite .",
    "dense neutrinos perform synchronized oscillations : all modes oscillate with a common frequency @xmath8 , even though their individual frequencies vary as @xmath9 .",
    "flavor oscillations can be visualized as the precession of polarization vectors @xmath10 in a `` flavor @xmath11 field . ''",

    "we extend this interpretation of the split phenomenon in several ways .",
    "we ( i )  show that flavor - lepton number conservation determines @xmath1 , ( ii )  solve the equations of motion explicitly in the adiabatic limit , and ( iii )  provide an analytic result for a generic case .",
    "we represent the flavor content of an isotropic @xmath13@xmath15 gas by flavor polarization vectors @xmath10 and @xmath16 , where overbarred quantities correspond to @xmath15 . we define their global counterparts as @xmath17 and @xmath18 and introduce @xmath19 , representing the net lepton number .",

    "the in - medium mixing angle above a sn core is small and therefore the mass and interaction basis almost coincide .",
    "collective effects then only induce pair transformations of the form @xmath43 , whereas the excess @xmath2 flux from deleptonization is conserved .",
    "we rewrite the eoms in terms of an `` effective hamiltonian '' for the individual modes as @xmath44 in the adiabatic limit each @xmath45 moves slowly compared to the precession of @xmath12 so that the latter follows the former .",
    "we assume that initially all @xmath12 represent the same flavor and thus are aligned . if initially @xmath46 is large , every @xmath12 is practically aligned with @xmath45 . therefore , in the adiabatic limit it stays aligned with @xmath47 for the entire evolution : @xmath48 which solves the eoms . here",

    "the nutations disappear and the co - rotating frame removes the full global evolution of the system .",
    "we have studied the phenomenon of spectral splits that is caused by neutrino - neutrino refraction in the sn dense - neutrino region . we have carried previous explanations of this novel effect  @xcite to the point of explicit solutions in the adiabatic limit .",
    "a spectral split occurs when a neutrino ensemble is prepared such that the common direction of the flavor polarization vectors deviates from the mass direction .",
    "an adiabatic density decrease turns all modes below a split energy @xmath158 into the mass direction , and the others in the opposite direction .",
    "remarkably , during this phase all modes remain in a single rotating plane , even after losing full synchronization .",
    "@xmath1 is determined by lepton number conservation in the mass basis .",
    "the spectral split is a generic feature of the adiabatic evolution when the density changes from large to small values .",
    "it can appear even in the absense of neutrino - neutrino interactions .",
    "indeed , in the usual msw case the evolution to zero density transforms @xmath2 to @xmath159 and @xmath160 to @xmath161 for all energies .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath162 .",
    "the neutrino - neutrino interactions shift @xmath74 to non - zero values .",
    "a spectral split is caused in the sn neutrino ( but not antineutrino ) flux by neutrino - neutrino interactions alone , especially during the accretion phase when ordinary msw resonances occur far outside the dense - neutrino region .",
    "later the matter profile may become so shallow that the h - resonance moves into this region  @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous action of collective effects and an ordinary msw resonance may then cause spectral splits for both neutrinos and antineutrinos , leading to a rich phenomenology , perhaps modifying r - process nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "of course , the fluxes will be further processed by ordinary conversion in the sn envelope  @xcite , thus modifying observable signatures .",
    "still , observing spectral splits would provide a smoking gun signature both for the relevant neutrino properties and , if it occurs among antineutrinos at late times , for the occurrence of a shallow density profile above the neutrino sphere .    the neutrino flux emitted by a sn is anisotropic so that neutrinos on different trajectories experience different neutrino - neutrino interaction histories  @xcite that would be expected to cause kinematical flavor decoherence of different angular modes  @xcite .",
    "a numerical exploration reveals , however , that in a typical sn scenario the deleptonization flux suppresses decoherence and the evolution is almost identical to that of an isotropic ensemble  @xcite .",
    "our treatment of the spectral evolution is apparently applicable in a realistic sn context .",
    "collective neutrino oscillation phenomena in a sn may well be important for the explosion mechanism , r - process nucleosynthesis and may provide detectable signatures in a high - statistics signal from the next galactic sn .",
    "building on previous ideas , our formalism gives a simple , elegant and quantitative explanation of seemingly impenetrable numerical results .",
