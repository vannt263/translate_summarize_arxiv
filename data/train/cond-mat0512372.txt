    "nonequilibrium condensation phase transitions from fluid phase into condensed phase have been observed in a variety of phenomena ranging from traffic flow to polymer gels @xcite . in the steady state ,",
    "a finite fraction of total particles condenses on a single site in condensed phase when the total particle density @xmath2 is increased beyond a certain critical value @xmath10 . in fluid phase below @xmath10",
    ", the particle number of each site fluctuates around @xmath2 without the condensation .",
    "various kinds of nonequilibrium mass transport models exhibit the condensation transitions or only condensation . the simplest and well - known model is zero - range process(zrp ) in one - dimension @xcite . in zrp ,",
    "many identical particles occupy sites on a lattice .",
    "each site may contain an integer number of particles and one of these particles can hop to one of the nearest neighboring sites with a rate that depends on the number of particles at the site of departure .",
    "the chipping ( single - particle dissociation ) and aggregation processes of zrp describe various condensations such as jamming of traffic @xcite , bunching of buses @xcite , coalescence of shaken steel balls @xcite and condensation of edges in networks @xcite .",
    "recent studies of zrp on scale - free @xcite and directed networks @xcite reveal the conditions under which condensation takes place .",
    "another important class of condensation transitions emerges when the diffusion of the whole particles of a single site is involved in addition to the chipping and aggregation .",
    "these processes arise in a variety of phenomena such as polymer gels @xcite , the formation of colloidal suspensions @xcite , river networks @xcite and clouds @xcite .",
    "recently studied conserved - mass aggregation(ca ) model is the simplest one incorporating diffusion , chipping and aggregation upon contact @xcite . in one dimensional ca model , the mass @xmath11 of site @xmath12 moves either to site @xmath13 or to site @xmath14 with unit rate , and then @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "with rate @xmath1 , unit mass chips off from site @xmath12 and moves to one of the nearest neighboring sites ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "as total masses are conserved , the conserved density @xmath2 and @xmath1 determine the phase of ca model .",
    "the condensation transition arises via the competition between diffusion and chipping processes .",
    "the diffusion of masses tends to produce massive aggregates and consequently creates more vacant sites .",
    "the chipping of unit mass tends to prevent the formation of aggregates , so that it leads to a replenishment of the lower end of mass distribution .    the single site mass distribution @xmath19 , i.e.",
    ", the probability that a site has mass @xmath20 in the steady state , was shown to undergo phase transitions on regular lattices @xcite . for a fixed @xmath1 , as @xmath2 is varied across the critical value @xmath21 , the behavior of @xmath19 for large @xmath20 was found to be @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath10 is given as @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath24 are shown to be independent of spatial dimension @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the tail of the mass distribution changes from exponential to an algebraic decay as @xmath2 approaches @xmath10 from below .",
    "as one further increases @xmath2 beyond @xmath10 , this asymptotic algebraic part of the critical distribution remains unchanged but in addition an infinite aggregate forms .",
    "this means that all the additional mass @xmath26 condenses onto a single site and does not disturb the background critical distribution .",
    "the @xmath27 case corresponds to zrp with constant chipping rate , and then there is no condensation transitions on regular lattices .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath24 is same everywhere on the critical line @xmath5 .",
    "recent studies showed that @xmath24 depends on the symmetry of movement and constraints of diffusion rate @xcite . in what following , we only consider the symmetric ca ( sca ) model where diffusion and chipping directions are unbiased @xcite .",
    "as mean field theory correctly predicts the phase diagram and @xmath24 of sca model in one dimension @xcite , the nature of the condensation transitions should remain unchanged in any higher dimensions .",
    "however recent studies of various dynamics on network structures showed that the structure of networks leads to more rich and intriguing behavior different from that predicted by the standard mean - field theory on regular lattices @xcite .",
    "for example , zrp on sfns was shown to exhibit condensation even at constant hopping rate which is the case of an infinite chipping rate of sca model @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the effect of network structures on the condensation transitions of sca model using random networks ( rns ) and scale - free networks ( sfns ) . as we shall see , on rns and sfns with the degree exponent @xmath7 , sca model undergoes the same type of condensation transitions as those in regular lattice across a critical line @xmath5 in @xmath2-@xmath1 plane with the exponent @xmath28 .",
    "however on sfns with @xmath29 where one or several nodes , so - called hub nodes , have a finite fraction of links , the fluid phase completely disappears and the condensation with exponentially decaying background mass distribution takes place for any non - zero density .",
    "the out - line of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce sca model on complex networks . the condensation transitions on rns and sfns are discussed in sec .",
    "iii and iv .",
    "to understand the condensation on sfns with @xmath6 , we discuss lamb - lion problems on sfns in sec .",
    "v. in sec .",
    "vi and vii , we discuss sca model at @xmath30 and the effect of diffusion of masses on average mass distribution on degrees respectively .",
    "finally we summarize our results in sec .",
    "we consider a network with @xmath31 nodes and @xmath32 links .",
    "the degree @xmath33 of a node @xmath12 is defined as the number of its links connected to other nodes .",
    "the average degree of a node @xmath34 is given as @xmath35 .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath36 is a poisson distribution for rns and a power - law distribution of @xmath37 for sfns .",
    "each node may have an integer number of particles , and the mass of a node is defined as the number of particles at the node .",
    "initially @xmath38 particles randomly distribute on @xmath31 nodes with given conserved density @xmath39 . next a node @xmath12 is chosen at random and one of the following events is occurred :    \\(i ) diffusion : with unit rate , the mass @xmath11 moves to the randomly selected nearest neighboring node @xmath40 .",
    "if the node @xmath40 has already mass @xmath41 , then the aggregation takes place ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "\\(ii ) chipping : with rate @xmath1 , unit mass ( a single particle ) at node @xmath12 chips off and moves to the randomly selected nearest neighboring node @xmath40 ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , diffusion and chipping processes compete each other so a condensation transition physically depends on two external parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 . at @xmath46 , however , only diffusion and aggregation take place so masses always condense onto a single site ( complete condensation ) .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath30 case corresponds to zrp with constant chipping rate .",
    "it was shown that zrp on scale - free networks exhibits complete condensation when mass - dependent chipping rate @xmath47 is given as @xmath48 , but @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is some threshold value @xcite .",
    "hence the sca model of @xmath8 is just the @xmath51 case of zrp so the complete condensation always aries at @xmath30 . as we shall see in the following section",
    ", the complete condensation also takes place on random networks at @xmath52 .    for the construction of sfn",
    ", we use a static model @xcite instead of preferential attachment algorithm @xcite .",
    "in static model , it is desired to use large @xmath34 to construct fully connected networks . in simulations , we use @xmath53 .",
    "we consider sca model on rns and sfns with @xmath3 having nodes @xmath54 and links @xmath55 for @xmath4 .",
    "we define the single node mass distribution @xmath56 at time @xmath57 , i.e. , the probability that a node has mass @xmath20 at @xmath57 as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of nodes with mass @xmath20 at time @xmath57 and @xmath60 is the mass of node @xmath12 at @xmath57 . from the normalization condition of @xmath56 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath61 , all @xmath56 should reach the stationary state at the same time .",
    "for instance , @xmath62 is given as @xmath63 .",
    "hence , if @xmath64 saturates to its steady state value @xmath65 after some time @xmath66 , then @xmath56 for any mass @xmath20 also should reach its steady state value @xmath19 after the time @xmath66 .",
    "so the characteristic time @xmath67 at which @xmath56 saturates is expected to be independent of mass @xmath20 , and @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the maximal mass . in fig . 1 , we plot @xmath56 of @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 on various networks .",

    "the critical density @xmath10 is @xmath75 for rn and @xmath76 for sfn with @xmath77 respectively . in fluid phase ( @xmath78 )",
    ", @xmath19 exponentially decays for large mass in both rn and sfn with @xmath74 . at @xmath79 ,",
    "@xmath19 algebraically decays on both rn and sfn with @xmath77 as @xmath80 with @xmath81 for rn and @xmath82 for sfn with @xmath77 without condensations .",
    "the values of @xmath24 of both networks also agree well with @xmath83 of regular lattices @xcite . in condensed phase ( @xmath84 ,",
    "the access mass of @xmath85 condenses on a single node in the both networks without changing the background critical distribution . to map out phase diagrams for rn and sfn with @xmath77",
    ", we measure @xmath10 and @xmath24 for @xmath86 and @xmath71 , and find that @xmath24 is the same within error on the critical line .",
    "3 shows the phase diagrams of rn and sfn with @xmath77 .",
    "the solid line denotes the critical line , @xmath87 of regular lattices @xcite . on regular lattices ,",
    "the @xmath5 is independent of dimensionality .",
    "however on networks , @xmath21 depends on the underlying network structures .",
    "we also confirm that sfn with @xmath88 undergoes the same type of condensation transitions .",
    "therefore we conclude that sca model on rns and sfns with @xmath3 undergoes the same type of condensation transitions from fluid phase into condensed phase for @xmath89 as those on one - dimensional regular lattice .",
    "however the critical line depends on the underlying network structures .",
    "for @xmath4 , we perform simulations on sfns with @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath54 nodes and @xmath55 links . we plot @xmath56 of @xmath93 in fig . 1 ( c ) for example , and average @xmath56 after @xmath67 for the steady state @xmath19 . as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "@xmath67 is same for all masses .",
    "the mass distribution @xmath19 for @xmath6 show quite different behavior from that for @xmath94 .",
    "4 shows @xmath19 on sfns with @xmath95 and @xmath92 for @xmath96 and @xmath97 with @xmath98 . as in the condensed phase of rns and sfns with @xmath3 , there is a condensation of mass @xmath99 .",
    "however @xmath19 exponentially decays for large mass rather than power - law .",
    "we also measure @xmath19 for various @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and confirm the same behavior of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore we conclude that for @xmath4 , sca on sfns with @xmath6 exhibits an infinite aggregation with an exponential background mass distribution .",
    "we call this phase incomplete condensed phase to reflect exponential mass distributions ( fig .",
    "4 ( c ) ) . intriguingly the two features of the fluid and the condensed phase on regular lattice coexist on sfns with @xmath6 . such a behavior was found in the lattice gas model proposed to describe the distribution of droplets in the fragmentation process following a nuclear collision @xcite .",
    "the nonexistence of the fluid phase for @xmath6 mainly comes from the hub structure of sfns with @xmath6 where one or several nodes have a finite fraction of total links @xcite . due to the hub structure ,",
    "all masses move to a hub node by both diffusion and chipping processes unlike sfns with @xmath7 where the chipping tends to split masses and prevents aggregations .",
    "hence there are no processes to prevent the formation of infinite aggregation for @xmath6 .",
    "the difference from zrp is that the diffusion process moves an infinite aggregation of mass @xmath100 at a hub node to the others .",
    "then the chipping distributes small masses of @xmath100 onto neighboring nodes . in this way",
    ", nodes with small degree can have mass so the resultant @xmath19 is exponential .",
    "it is hard to show the existence of infinite aggregation for the limit of @xmath101 numerically with finite size networks .",
    "instead we investigate annihilating random walks of two particles on sfns ( lamb - lion problem ) for the condition of the existence of the fluid phase on sfns . for @xmath101 limit",
    ", we assume an infinite aggregation and neglect the presence of other masses .",
    "then unit mass chips off from the aggregation , and diffuses around on the networks . for",
    "the existence of an infinite condensate in the steady state , the two masses should aggregate again in finite time interval . if not , unit mass continuously chips off from the infinite aggregation , which will finally disappear . hence if the unit mass ( lamb ) survives indefinitely without meeting the infinite aggregation ( lion ) , then the fluid phase exists at zero density limit .",
    "otherwise , the condensed phase exists for any @xmath102 . in next section",
    ", we investigate a lamb - lion problem on rns and sfns .",
    "we consider one lamb and one lion problem on networks .",
    "if a lamb meets a lion on the same node , then it dies .",
    "hence the interesting quantity is the survival probability @xmath103 of a lamb at time @xmath57 . on @xmath25 dimensional regular lattice ,",
    "@xmath103 depends on @xmath25 as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath104 on networks , the steady state distribution of a random walker is proportional to the degree @xmath33 of node @xmath12 @xcite as @xmath105 hence the probability of finding two walkers at the same node should depend on the second moment @xmath106 .",
    "while @xmath106 is finite for rns and sfns with @xmath7 , it diverges for sfns with @xmath6 .",
    "so rns and sfns with @xmath7 correspond to infinite dimensional homogeneous regular lattice in macroscopic scale , while sfns with @xmath6 are generically inhomogeneous .",
    "therefore @xmath103 is expected to be constant in the thermodynamic limit on rns and sfns with @xmath7 .",
    "it means the existence of the fluid phase for the limit of @xmath107 for any @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "on the other hand , for the incomplete condensed phase of @xmath6 , @xmath103 should decay to zero for @xmath6 .",
    "we measure @xmath103 of a lamb on rns and sfns with various @xmath108 for several values of @xmath31 from @xmath109 to @xmath110 and up to @xmath110 time steps .",
    "initially a lamb and a lion are placed on randomly selected two nodes . in fig . 5",
    ", we plot @xmath103 for @xmath111 ( a ) and @xmath112 ( b ) for various system size @xmath31 .",
    "interestingly @xmath103 decays exponentially in both sfns for any @xmath31 .",
    "for example , @xmath103 of @xmath77 and @xmath113 exponentially decays with very large characteristic time @xmath24 order of @xmath110 over the whole time interval .",
    "we also confirm the same exponential decay of @xmath103 on rns for any @xmath31 .",
    "unlike on regular lattices where the exponential decay of @xmath103 comes from finite size effect of lattices , @xmath103 on networks shows such a exponential decay at very early time .",
    "the exponential decay of @xmath103 mainly comes from the small world nature of networks @xcite , i.e. , the average path length between a pair of nodes increases logarithmically with @xmath31 . as @xmath103 shows the exponential decay for any @xmath108 , we are interested in the average life time @xmath114 of a lamb rather than @xmath103 itself .",
    "we measure the life time @xmath114 of a lamb on rns and sfns with several @xmath108 values for @xmath31 up to @xmath110 and plot @xmath114 against @xmath31 in fig . 5 ( c ) and ( d ) . in fig . 5 ( c ) , @xmath114 linearly increases with @xmath31 for both rn and sfn with @xmath77 . assuming @xmath115 , we estimate @xmath116 for rn and sfn with @xmath77 by measuring slopes .",
    "however for @xmath117 of fig .",
    "5 ( d ) , @xmath114 exhibits quit different behavior .",
    "@xmath114 of @xmath118 and @xmath112 tend to saturate to some asymptotic value with decreasing successive slopes .",
    "however the characteristic size @xmath119 at which @xmath114 begins to saturate increases as @xmath108 approaches @xmath120 .",
    "for example , @xmath114 of @xmath121 seems to algebraically increase up to @xmath113 .",
    "it means that @xmath122 of @xmath121 is already larger than @xmath110 . to see the saturation at @xmath121 , big size @xmath31 much larger than @xmath110",
    "is needed but it is practically very difficult .",
    "it is hard to believe that @xmath114 diverges in power - law fashion as @xmath108 approaches @xmath92 because @xmath114 of small @xmath108 is already begin to saturate at moderate @xmath31 order of @xmath123 .",
    "hence @xmath114 of @xmath124 is expected to saturate to its asymptotic value even though we can not see the saturation via simulations as @xmath108 approaches @xmath92 from below . at @xmath125",
    ", @xmath114 also increases algebraically with @xmath31 . by measuring successive slopes",
    ", we estimate @xmath126 for @xmath125 . however ,",
    "as the exponent @xmath127 continuously varies as @xmath108 increases to @xmath92 , the value of @xmath127 at @xmath125 may have no special meaning .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) for @xmath125 , the condensation already occurs at sufficiently low density @xmath96 even for small size @xmath54 so @xmath114 of @xmath125 is believed to saturate in thermodynamic limit as for @xmath121",
    ". therefore we are convinced that the life time of a lamb is finite in thermodynamic limit of @xmath128 for @xmath6 . from the behavior of the life time",
    "@xmath114 , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath103 is investigated in the following .    as shown in fig . 5 ( a )",
    ", @xmath103 decays exponentially as @xmath129 . from the definition of @xmath130",
    ", we have @xmath131 .",
    "hence @xmath24 diverges linearly on sfns with @xmath7 and rns , while it saturates for @xmath6 .",
    "the scaling behavior of @xmath24 means that @xmath103 on rns and sfns with @xmath94 is nonzero constant in thermodynamic limit of @xmath132 , and exponentially decays to zero on sfns with @xmath6 .",
    "hence we have @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the asymptotic value of @xmath24 , and depends on @xmath108 .",
    "as @xmath103 decays exponentially to zero for @xmath6 , two particles initially located on the same node should meet or aggregate within finite time interval .",
    "hence the finite life time on sfns with @xmath6 supports the numerically expected condensed phase for any @xmath102 on sfns with @xmath90 as mentioned in the previous section . on the other hand ,",
    "the finite @xmath135 on rns and sfns with @xmath136 implies the existence of the fluid phase at @xmath137 limit , which is also consistent with the phase diagrams of fig .",

    ", @xmath100 decreases as @xmath2 goes to zero as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "so it is hard to observe the condensation at low density for small @xmath31 .",

    "together with the recent study on sfns @xcite , the complete condensation always occurs on both rns and sfns in zero range process with constant hopping rate .",
    "the discontinuity of @xmath141 clearly comes from the nature of chipping process of unit mass .",

    "however unlike on regular lattices , the critical line on the networks depends on the network structures . on the other hand , on scale - free networks of @xmath172 where one or several nodes have a finite fraction of degrees , an infinite aggregation with exponentially decaying background mass distribution always takes place for any nonzero density , so",
    "no phase transitions occur for @xmath4 .",
    "the condensation and exponential mass distribution of small masses come from the generic inhomogeneity of network structure of sfns with @xmath6 .",
    "however we are not able to numerically show the existence of the condensation phase at zero density limit for @xmath6 due to the small world nature of networks @xcite .",
    "instead we numerically study the survival probability of a particle in pair annihilating random walks , so - called one lamb and one lion problem on networks .",
    "for the formation of an infinite aggregation of masses at zero density limit , unit mass chipped off from the infinite aggregation should aggregate again with the aggregation within finite time interval .",
    "we numerically show that in thermodynamic limit , the survival probability @xmath103 of a lamb ( unit mass ) is finite on random networks and scale - free networks ( sfns ) with @xmath7 , but exponentially decays to zero with finite life time on sfns with @xmath6 . based on the finite life time of a lamb on sfns with @xmath6 , we indirectly confirm the incomplete condensed phase for any @xmath139 on sfns with @xmath6 .    at @xmath8",
    ", sca model corresponds to zero - range process ( zrp ) with constant chipping rate @xcite .",
    "zrp with constant chipping rate on sfns was shown to exhibit complete condensation @xcite .",
    "we also numerically show that the complete condensation takes place for any @xmath102 on random networks by measuring average mass of a node with degree @xmath140 .",
    "hence the complete condensation always takes place for any nonzero density in zrp with constant chipping rate on random and scale - free networks .",
    "finally we investigate the behavior of the average mass of a node with degree @xmath140 , @xmath141 in the fluid and the condensed phase .",
    "in zrp with constant chipping rate , @xmath141 linearly increases with degree @xmath140 , and jumps to the total mass of the system at hub degree @xmath144 @xcite . hence in sca model , @xmath141 is expected to show such a jump in the condensed phase for @xmath173 .",
    "however @xmath141 linearly increases up to @xmath144 without jumps in both the fluid and the condensed phase .",
    "we numerically confirm the linearity of @xmath141 , and also analytically show @xmath157 with the assumption that the diffusion is the only relevant factor in the steady state",
    ". therefore the steady state distribution of @xmath141 is determined by diffusion of masses rather than chipping of unit mass unlike in zrp .",
