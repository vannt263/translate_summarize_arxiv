    "the atomically thick layer of carbon atoms with a honeycomb lattice structure - known as graphene - still keeps attracting considerable deal of attention due to its potential use in electronics .",
    "graphene presents several exotic physical properties , such as the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) @xcite , associated with a nontrivial topological time - reversal invariant state that has a bulk energy gap ; and a pair of gapless spin filtered edge states at the sample boundaries .",
    "recently , another striking topological phenomenon has attracted a notable interest , i.e. the quantum _ anomalous _ hall effect ( qahe ) @xcite .",
    "this topological phenomenon appears if one of the spin channels in the qsh state is suppressed by the own sample magnetization , with the emergence of an electronic topological phase transition , characterized by quantized hall conductance in an insulating state .",
    "this interesting phenomena predicted to be host in graphene @xcite , has been experimentally observed in topologically magnetic thin films @xcite , with a great promise in spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "a mechanism highly desirable in the development of spin - based devices is the effective control of the spin current flow @xcite . to obtain polarized electronic current ,",
    "one of the essential strategies is the creation of an effective potential barrier for a given spin specie , while the other can flow with no resistance .",
    "also , the energy gap control , is an important issue related to the _ on - off _ electrical tuning @xcite .",
    "one of the key elements to implement graphene based nanostructure in spintronic devices , relies upon the role of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) . in graphene , there are two different soc contributions : ( i ) the _ extrinsic _ rashba soc , originated from the inversion symmetry breaking due to the substrate , which can also be manipulated by applied electric field @xcite and ( ii ) the _ intrinsic _ soc ( iso ) arising from the carbon atomic soc - which is known to give rise to the existence of spin - polarized edge states in the qsh phase @xcite .",
    "mechanical deformations have a significant effect on the electronic , quantum transport and optical properties of a material and is used in the silicon electronics industry to boost device performance . for graphene and graphene nanoribbons ( gnr ) both experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite have confirmed that the band structure can be dramatically altered by strain deformation .",
    "for instance , due to the breaking of sublattice symmetry , an uniaxial strain may induce a change of topology of the fermi line , a merging of two inequivalent dirac points and a tunable band gap at @xmath0 point @xcite .",
    "thus , it may be used to trigger a quantum phase transition from a semi - metal to a semiconductor .    a combination of basic elements of uniaxial strain , soc , exchange field , and staggered potential leads to a very exotic physics @xcite . for instance ,",
    "intrinsic soc is favorable for opening a bulk energy gap around dirac points @xcite , while rashba soc depresses the gap @xcite .",
    "then intrinsic and rashba socs make an opposite contribution to the topological phase of qshe .",
    "besides , rashba soc breaks down inversion symmetry and exchange term breaks down time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) . thus changing rso and exchange interaction may lead to a qsh to qah phase transition @xcite , which can be further manipulated by the application of uniaxial uniform strains @xcite . although , the quantum conductance of gnrs under uniaxial strain has been previously reported @xcite , the spin related terms and staggered potential were not taken into account .    in this paper , we aim to analyse the electronic transport control and the ldos in gnr with different terminations in the qahe phase by means of uniform strain deformations and smoothness of staggered potential . the electronic transport can be performed by using a two - terminal device akin to a field electron transistor ( fet ) .",
    "qahe phase can be determined experimentally , by on - site spin - resolved density of states , that can be accessed by spatially scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) or by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) @xcite .",
    "we consider gnr with homogeneous socs , exchange field interaction and staggered potential .",
    "the uniaxial strain is included through the introduction of strain - dependent hopping parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system in the real space reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the nearest - neighbor @xmath3-band tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the fermionic operators @xmath4/@xmath5 creates / anihilates an electron at site _",

    "the unstrained @xmath9ev @xcite and the deformed lattice distances @xmath10 are related to the relaxed ones @xmath11 by @xmath12 , where the uniaxial strain tensor is given in ref .",

    "the central conductor is the only region under the influence of soc effects , exchange field and staggered potential ; it is also connected to semi - infinite leads by nearest - neighbor hopping . to avoid surface mismatch @xcite ,",
    "we have considered that the leads are also strained .",
    "therefore , a perfect atomic matching at the interface leads / central conductor is achieved .",
    "the green s function of the device ( omitting the spin indices ) is then calculated by @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the advanced / retarded green s function , @xmath41 is the energy ( @xmath42 ) of the injected electron ( the fermi energy at a given doping ) .",
    "@xmath43 stands for the hamiltonian in the central region and @xmath44 are the self - energies that describe the influence of the left / right leads , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the green s function for the @xmath47 semi - infinite lead , obtained through an iterative procedure of the tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite , and @xmath48 couples each lead to the central region .",

    "in what follows , we focus on a zgnr ( @xmath53 ) with a specific width of 5.4 nm and length of 10.93 nm ( while in absence of strain ) .",
    "similarly , we have chosen a metallic agnr , i.e @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being a positive integer , with approximately same width and length .",
    "it is important to mention that wider the ribbon , more conducting channels can be available for higher doping , therefore the problem becomes more complex for both zgnr and agnr .",
    "although , close to the fermi level there will be the same amount of conducting channels for the pristine metallic nanoribbons .",
    "we have also checked the length dependence , and it is indeed _ relevant _ to the device prototype , as the scattering region , i.e. the region of the device has the effects of soc , exchange field and staggered potential enhanced , as the injected electron can _ feel _ such fields in a longer length scale . although we choose a specific length , the results presented here show a general behavior of such devices .

    "( b)-(c ) and ( e)-(f ) correspond to the density of states and the total conductance associated with panel ( a ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "the inset in ( e ) shows clearly the vanishing of the density of states close to the fermi level for the strained agnr device . ]    to illustrate the band structure of pristine gnr under uniaxial strains , we assume that except for the first term all other terms in eq .",

    "in contrast , ( c ) and ( f ) illustrate the conductance profiles .",
    "one can notice the edge states of zgnr ( thick solid line ) at the fermi level for 26-zgnr , is robust against uniaxial strains , as demonstrated in panel ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the ribbon is metallic due to the strain - robust zero - energy flat band , and the conductance turns out to be an integer multiple of the quantum conductance @xmath60 , as the channels are completely transparent . for high energy doping",
    ", there is only a slightly change in the plateaus , and as the zgnr has two distinct valleys , the conductance increases always by 4@xmath60 .    in strong contrast , the band structures of the agnr families ( semiconducting or metallic ) are highly sensitive to the tensile uniaxial strain . as strain increases ,",
    "the electrical conductivity may change from an insulator to a conductor or vice - versa .",
    "but , the prominent effect is observed near the fermi level , as strain can induce a band gap in an otherwise metallic agnrs , or change an existent band gap in semiconducting ribbons in a non - monotonic way @xcite .",
    "this band gap can be explained by the strain - induced shifting of the dirac point , similar to previous works on deformed carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "for instance , strains drastically change the electronic behavior of metallic 47-agrn , shown in ( d ) , responsible for an electronic topological transition ( ett ) from metallic to semiconductor .",
    "it manifest itself for the appearance of a vanishing density of states close to the charge neutrality point ( highlighted in the inset of panel ( e ) ) .",
    "in addition , the transport gap ( @xmath61 ) shows a strain direction dependence , which has been intensively explored by other authors @xcite , which demonstrated that is robust even across strained junctions or intrinsic defects @xcite .",

    "panels ( d ) and ( h ) show the total conductance .",
    "the parameters used in all panels are @xmath14=0.1@xmath62 , @xmath22=0 and @xmath25=@xmath63 . ]    to study the conductance characteristics in presence of both rashba soc and exchange field , we set the parameters @xmath14=0.1@xmath62 , @xmath25=0.2@xmath62 , and @xmath22=0@xmath62 .",
    "notice that with these parameters , the system is in the qahe phase @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if the iso parameter is different from zero , there is an upper - limited value of @xmath22 @xcite , beyond which a new phase characterized by a vanishing chern number @xmath64=0 can take place ; this phase is the so - called trs - broken qsh phase @xcite .",
    "the spin - resolved conductance @xmath65 is shown in fig .",
    "[ grafico3 ] : for ( a ) unstrained , ( b ) strained along @xmath58 , ( c ) strained along @xmath59 and ( d ) the total conductance @xmath66 of a zgnr .",
    "notice that there is a suppression for both the spin conserving and the spin - flip conductance components for either unstrained or strained zgnr in the energy range considered .",
    "however , these backscattering ( transmission dips ) at certain precise energies at the first plateau are different depending on the strain configuration , and a close inspection shows that conducting channels for non - spin flip and spin - flip conductances oscillate .",
    "depending on the fermi energy and set parameters , certain conductance components can even be completely suppressed .",
    "this suppression is attributed to the appearance of quasi - localized states in the device , which may produce sharp scattering resonances , also known as resonant backscattering which is a general behavior of quasi-1d quantum systems @xcite . for higher energies , however , the large number of conducting channels leads to a non - vanishing transmission , as the channels get mixed along the device , and results in the appearance of an interchannel backscattering dominated by interference effects . therefore , in the qsh phase protected by the trs , nonmagnetic impurities do not cause backscattering on each boundary , and the spin transport in the edge states is dissipationless at zero temperature . in the qah phase , however , there is a weak scattering between forward and backward movers , leading to a low - dissipation spin transport . at low energy",
    ", this interesting strain - controllable behavior of conducting channel suppression might be efficiently used to filter electrical current of desired spins , in spin filtering devices . in fig .",
    "[ grafico3 ] ( d ) , we show the total conductance , which is nearly robust against strains , specially close to the charge neutrality point , where the deviations due to strain are quite small .",
    "in contrast , the conductance of agnr shows a drastic modification , with the development of a transport gap , which is insensitive to the electron spin that is injected - collected in the device .",
    "however , this induced transport gap is dependent upon the direction of the applied strain , with a larger conduction suppression along @xmath58 ( red dashed line ) with @xmath61= 0.04 @xmath62 , and @xmath61= 0.086 @xmath62 while along @xmath59 , that can be observed in panel ( h ) . also , the total conductance exhibits different plateaus : around @xmath67 and approximately @xmath60 in agnr without and with strain , respectively , which is one less quantum of conductance available for the electron to be transmitted along the device .",
    "another remarkable phenomenon is the oscillatory dependence of the spin components of @xmath65 on the value of @xmath68 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ grafico4 ] ( a)-(d ) , where the curves correspond to different topological gnrs and strain setups for @xmath69 .",

    ", we set @xmath25=0 in the calculation .",
    "then , the system is time - reversal invariant and the conductance components @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this oscillatory behavior is reminiscent of the spin field effect transistor ( fet ) and has a similar source @xcite , as the spin _ precesses _ as it propagates in the presence of the rashba field , acquiring a net phase that is proportional to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the length of the device . further inspecting the strain - induced band gap in 47-agnr in presence of soc and exchange field interactions ,",
    "one notices that in fig .",
    "[ grafico4 ] ( e ) a similar band gap oscillation characteristic as reported in a earlier work @xcite .",
    "in the regime of small strain , the band gap shows approximately linear response , with increasing values of strain , however , it starts to oscillate .",
    "further investigation shows that the amplitude and period of the gap - oscillation are tuned by direction of the strain , as shown in fig .",

    "[ grafico4 ] ( f ) .",
    "notice that the transport gap is indeed strongly tuned by strain - direction .",

    ", we can notice that the ldos is robust against strain with a slight modification on the amplitudes of the ldos",
    ". however , when a staggered sublattice potential is considered by setting @xmath81=6@xmath62 , smoothness parameter @xmath32 dependent behavior emerges .",
    "for instance , by setting @xmath32=0.1 implies in the suppression of the ldos in one of the edges for a given spin .",
    "also , there is a clear asymmetry , that can be explained by the a / b sublattice asymmetry - in one side , the edge terminates in a - site , while in the other in b - site .",
    "this characteristic makes the staggered potential being an effective barrier - indeed for both spin species when @xmath32=4.0 is set - as the staggered potential can be considered as a non - magnetic impurity . also , the ldos amplitudes has some important changes while applying strain with @xmath82 along longitudinal ( @xmath58 ) and transversal direction ( @xmath59 ) , which can be understood by compression / elongation of the ribbon width that is directly associated to the length smoothness of the staggered potential .",
    "= 6@xmath62 . here , @xmath14=0.1@xmath62 , @xmath22=0.05@xmath62 and @xmath25=@xmath63 have been used .",
    "the curves are for different configurations of applied strain in the system . ]    for the case of an agnr , away from strain induced transport gap @xmath61 ( in fact it does not change the strain induced transport gap ) , we can also observe changes in the ldos amplitude for different strain configurations .",
    "however , some important aspects can be observed by adding a staggered potential : ( i ) - for @xmath83 , that would correspond to a less smooth potential ( the potential effectively zero in the central region of the ribbon ) , there is an emerging localization in the agnr akin to the edge states usually observed in zgnr @xcite , and perfectly symmetric on both edges as it does have same sublattice termination .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath84 , that would correspond to smother staggered potential , the edge localized ldos is fully suppressed for both spin species , and the contributing conducting channels are now at the central region .",
    "so the transition from an abrupt to a smoother staggered potential might be traced down to a topological phase transition with the quenching of an emerging edge state , therefore the chern number is expected to vanish in this condition @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the spin - resolved electronic transport and ldos of gnr devices under the influence of soc , exchange field , smooth staggered potential and uniform uniaxial strains .",
    "our results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a total electron transmission suppression of specific spin specie , which can be further tailored by uniaxial tensile strain on specific directions . furthermore , by including a graded staggered potential , the following interesting behaviors have been observed in the ldos maps : ( i ) selective edge conducting channel suppression for zgnr for a sharper staggered potential and ( ii ) emerging of an edge state for agnr for sharper staggered potential , which is associated to a topological phase transition @xcite .",
    "these results suggest a possible implementation of a field - effect topological quantum transistor based on strained gnr , thus paving the way for the development of novel topological quantum devices .",
