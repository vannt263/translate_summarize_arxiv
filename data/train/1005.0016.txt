    "many authors have tried to empirically justify the mathematically well - established orthoisomorphism between the so - called hilbert lattice and the lattice of subspaces of a hilbert space , which has been worked out by many authors over the last 75 years.@xcite however , a missing link between empirical quantum measurements and its lattice structure was a proper description of a correspondence between the standard quantum measurements , which use hilbert vectors and states , on the one hand , and hilbert lattices ( algebras of the closed subspaces of hilbert space ) , which make use of subspaces that contain these vectors and/or are spanned by them , on the other .",

    "the proof is similar for larger @xmath0 .",
    "the general form for larger @xmath0 can be inferred by looking at the proof , although we have not defined a `` compact '' notation for it as we have for eq .",

    "( [ eq : noa ] ) for @xmath113 .    because of the large size of the @xmath0oa equations for larger @xmath0 , in order to ensure that our input to latticeg was free from typos we used an auxiliary utility program , oagen , to generate @xmath0oa equations in the form of either eq .",
    "( [ eq : noa ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq:3oaa ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of the 7oa equation on the peres greechie diagram involves 7 nested loops , each with 116 iterations ( since its hasse diagram has 116 nodes ) .",
    "for the shorter equation of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3oaa ] ) , each evaluation at the innermost loop involves an assignment to 489 variable occurrences and 487 join , meet , and @xmath122 operations ( the last having a precomputed table in memory from its join , meet , and orthocomplementation expansion ) .",
    "thus @xmath123 ( 138 quadrillion ) operation evaluations ( @xmath124 includes the final @xmath29 comparison and a single orthocomplementation ) are required for a full scan .    such a direct , full evaluation is a challenge on today s hardware , even with a cluster of processors , unless one is very lucky to encounter a failure early on in the scan ( and we were ) .",
    "in addition , we made several enhancements to latticeg to help make this project more feasible :    * the main algorithm was improved .",
    "the original algorithm assigned each possible combination of lattice nodes to the equation variables , then evaluated the resulting equation according to the structure of the lattice ( i.e. the suprema , infima , and orthocomplements in the hasse diagram derived from the input greechie diagram ) .",
    "the main scan consists of nested loops that processes all nodal assignments to the first variable in the outermost loop , then all assignments to the second variable in the next inner loop , and so on . since it has 7 variables , testing the 7oa equation involves 7 nested loops .",
    "+ the new algorithm takes into account , at each loop level , the variables in outer loops ( which have known assignments ) and evaluates as much of the equation as it can with those known variables .",
    "the equation is then shrunk with these partial evaluations , for further processing at that and deeper loop levels . eventually , the equation is shrunk to a length of one , which means that it is completely evaluated . while a length of one will always be obtained at the innermost loop level",
    ", it may also occur at an outer level ( such as when an expression containing not - yet - assigned variables is conjoined with a partial evaluation that resulted in lattice 0 ) .",
    "in such cases , processing of further inner loops becomes unnecessary .",
    "so , the new algorithm benefits from ( 1 ) shorter equations to evaluate at deeper loop levels and ( 2 ) possible skipping of the deepest loops .",
    "overall , this results in a speedup of about a factor of 10 for the 7oa equation evaluation . + because of the complexity of the new partial evaluation algorithm , it was put into a new version of latticeg called lattice2 g . this allows us to check that the old and new algorithms produce the same result , helping to make sure there is nt a program bug in the new algorithm . having two programs also allows us to directly measure the speedup afforded by the new algorithm .",
    "* for testing a huge lattice , a feature was added to break up the testing into several independent parts . this way the different parts",
    "can be run on different processors in our cluster",
    ". the test can be partitioned into any number of outermost and first inner loop iterations .",
    "for example , the peres greechie diagram has a hasse representation with 116 nodes .",
    "we can specify that the cluster test the 98th iteration ( out of 116 ) of the outmost loop and the 101st through 110th iteration ( out of 116 ) of the next inner loop . *",
    "a feature was added to analyze an equation failure to determine what nodes , atoms , and blocks were not involved in the failure . in particular",
    ", a block is said not to affect the failure whenever all operations that `` visit '' ( non-0 and non-1 ) nodes in the block do not involve any other ( non-0 and non-1 ) nodes in that block .",
    "this is described in more detail in sec .  [",
    "sec : main ] , where we show how this feature was used to determine which blocks could be removed from peres greechie lattice to obtain a smaller lattice that satisfies 6oa but violates 7oa",
    "after 75 years of research carried out in the field of the algebraic structure underlying quantum hilbert space  the hilbert lattice",
    " only one class of equations ( beyond the orthomodular lattice laws ) that hold in it was found : the class of orthoarguesian equations .",
    "individual orthoarguesian equations were found in the eighties and nineties .",
    "all other equations known to hold in a hilbert lattice require a state introduced to it .",
    "then in 2000 we found @xcite a class ( @xmath0oa ) of lattices determined by _",
    "generalized orthoarguesian equations _ ( @xmath0oa ) and proved that the following inclusion holds : @xmath1 .",
    "we also proved that all previously found oas are equivalent to either 3oa or 4oa , we proved that 4oa is strictly stronger than 3oa , and we found lattices in which 4oa passed but 5oa failed and lattices in which 5oa passed and 6oa failed .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we found a series of lattices  shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : peres ] and [ fig:7oa01 ] and obtained as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : main]in which 6oa passes and 7oa fails .",
    "this is important because it very strongly indicates that the above inclusion is strict : @xmath2 .",
    "we obtained these lattices by analyzing kochen - specker sets .",
    "the kochen - specker sets correspond to strictly quantum systems .",
    "they can not be given a classical interpretation at all , and therefore their lattice representation should be a proper lattice representation .",
    "we wanted to find out how they can be constructed , what they look like , and what their hasse diagrams look like . in the literature",
    ", we only found that 3-dim ks systems in particular and spin-1 systems in general were described by greechie diagrams ( as we stressed in the introduction ) .    to our surprise , all but peres greechie lattices violated 3oa , and to our joy peres greechie lattice passed 3oa through 6oa but violated 7oa .",
    "we say surprise , because every lattice of a quantum system must be represented by a sublattice of a hilbert lattice , and the violations of oas meant that the representation by greechie lattices is incorrect .",
    "it is incorrect because the greechie lattices are not sublattices of the lattice of closed subspaces of a hilbert space , a fact that escaped the authors mentioned in the introduction .",
    "therefore in sec .",
    "[ sec : represent ] , we explain what a proper lattice of any quantum system should look like and how we can use mmpls when we need a lattice for a particular system which passes particular equations .",
    "we should mention out that the numbers of elements ( atoms and blocks ) of the smallest known lattices that satisfy @xmath0oa but violate @xmath125oa do not grow exponentially .",
    "for @xmath126 we have 13 , 17 , 22 , 28 , 33 and 7 , 10 , 13 , 18 , 21 atoms and blocks , respectively.@xcite an important open question is whether there is a pattern that can be identified in this or a similar series of lattices .",
    "if so , that might lead to a proof that @xmath125oa is strictly stronger than @xmath0oa for all @xmath0 .    since the class of hilbert lattices ( hl ) is a subclass of @xmath0oa for all @xmath0 ( as th .",
    "[ th : hs - ssnoa ] shows ) , an open question is what additional conditions must be added to @xmath0oa to specify hl , for both the finite and infinite dimensional cases ? are there other classes of equations that hold in every hl when we do not introduce states on it ? ( the other known equations such as godowski s and mayet s @xcite assume states . ) how far can we define hl only by means of sets of equations added to an ol ?        supported by the us national science foundation through a grant for the institute for theoretical atomic , molecular , and optical physics ( itamp ) at harvard university and smithsonian astrophysical observatory and the ministry of science , education , and sport of croatia through the project no .",
