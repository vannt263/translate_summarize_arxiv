    "<S> the leading - order amplitude in the low - energy expansion of @xmath6 @xcite is known to receive large higher - order corrections , both at @xmath7 @xcite and beyond @xcite .    the radiative decay @xmath8 is in principle an interesting channel . </S>",
    "<S> at lowest order @xmath9 , the amplitude is pure bremsstrahlung . at next - to - leading order </S>",
    "<S> an additional contribution appears ( direct emission ) that is non - vanishing even in the isospin limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the direct emission amplitude carries in principle new information that is not accessible in @xmath4 decays . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of a direct emission amplitude is not unique except that it starts at @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the photon momentum . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the so - called quadratic slope parameters of the non - radiative amplitude arising at @xmath7 also generate a radiative amplitude of @xmath10 that one may combine with the bremsstrahlung amplitude because it is also completely fixed by the non - radiative process . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently shown @xcite that one can define a generalized bremsstrahlung ( gb ) amplitude for a generic radiative four - meson process that includes the effects of all local terms of @xmath2 contributing to the non - radiative transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the main advantages of the gb amplitude are :    * since all local contributions to the non - radiative amplitude of @xmath7 are included , the uncertainties in the corresponding low - energy constants do not propagate to the direct emission amplitude ( defined here as the difference between the total and the gb amplitudes ) . * </S>",

    "<S> a so - called generalized bremsstrahlung amplitude can be introduced @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> as already announced , we use for the slope parameters the experimental values @xcite @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the theoretical prediction @xcite @xmath38 . </S>",

    "<S> + +    it is remarkable that the isospin conserving part of direct emission ( both kaon loops and vector meson exchange ) is smaller than the isospin violating component due to pion loops . in order to understand this suppression , we write the decay amplitude in the form </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 since only two of the @xmath74 are linearly independent this decomposition is of course not unique but it will be useful in the limit @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first observation is that the amplitude @xmath76 vanishes when the three pion momenta are equal . in the @xmath70 rest frame </S>",
    "<S> , this configuration corresponds to maximal photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , gauge invariance alone implies that the complete amplitude and in particular the direct emission part is small in a region where direct emission has any chance at all against ( generalized ) bremsstrahlung .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the isospin limit @xmath75 where only ( part of ) the direct emission amplitude survives . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> isospin violation can only come from the electromagnetic field which is the sum of @xmath77 and @xmath78 spurions . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath79 for @xmath80 only the @xmath81 , @xmath77 part of the photon contributes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the three pions must be in an isosinglet combination and any two pions are in an @xmath82 state . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the amplitude ( [ egeneral ] ) can be written in terms of a single invariant function @xmath83 with @xmath84 both the @xmath85exchange amplitude ( [ vmdg ] ) and the kaon - loop amplitude satisfy these conditions .    expressing , e.g. , @xmath86 in terms of @xmath87 , the amplitude ( [ egeneral ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be written as @xmath88 g^\\mu_{+- } { \\nonumber \\\\ } & & + \\left[a_{+-}(p_0,p_+,p_-,k ) -\\displaystyle\\frac{t_-}{t_+}a_{+-}(p_0,p_-,p_+,k)\\right ] g^\\mu_{0 + }   \\label{eud}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the amplitude is doubly suppressed for large photon energies : both the @xmath74 and the two invariant amplitudes in ( [ eud ] ) vanish in the symmetric configuration with @xmath89 . in general , this is not the case for the explicitly isospin violating contributions proportional to @xmath90 as can be seen from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ brems ] ) , ( [ gbrems ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of kaon - loop and vector meson exchange amplitudes is therefore a general feature of the amplitude in the limit @xmath75 , independently of the chiral order . </S>",
    "<S> the direct emission amplitude is strongly dominated by the pion loops . </S>",
    "<S> since this residual pion - loop contribution is itself small compared to the dominant gb amplitude , the theoretical uncertainty of the total direct emission amplitude is also small and certainly negligible in comparison with the present experimental errors entering the gb amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-5 ] ] 6 . </S>",
    "<S> + +    our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the concept of generalized bremsstrahlung is very efficient in avoiding the propagation of uncertainties in the non - radiative decays to the direct emission amplitudes . in the case at hand , we have shown that the numerically important final state interactions in @xmath91 @xcite are easily incorporated in the gb amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a very precise prediction of the radiative decay rate normalized to the non - radiative transition : @xmath92 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath93 loops dominate the direct emission amplitude even though they are isospin suppressed . nevertheless , the one - loop amplitude is negligible compared to gb for most of the photon energy range . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> isospin conserving contributions to direct emission such as kaon loops or vector meson exchange are suppressed , especially for large photon energies . </S>",
    "<S> since this is a general feature to all orders in the chiral expansion we expect it to be very difficult if not impossible to observe any direct emission effect in @xmath94 even with the anticipated yield of @xmath95 per year @xcite . </S>"
