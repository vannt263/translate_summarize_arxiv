    "in the dirac model of graphene , electrons propagating in the two - dimensional structure of the material are described by massless dirac fermions , with the speed of light replaced by the fermi velocity @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of the material correspond to those of a two - dimensional gas of massless relativistic particles @xcite , and its unique transport and optoelectronic properties can be understood as manifestations of specific quantum electrodynamic effects @xcite .",
    "the fine structure constant in the dirac model of graphene is much larger than in qed , however , and relativistic effects are greatly enhanced in the condensed matter context , allowing for exotic predictions of qed to be tested in table - top experiments .",
    "outstanding examples are the observation of klein tunneling in graphene heterojunctions @xcite and of an anomalous integer quantum hall effect due to the linear dispersion relation of the massless dirac particles @xcite .",
    "a long standing prediction of quantum electrodynamics is the instability of its vacuum in the presence of a strong electric field @xcite .",
    "if the field strength is larger than a certain critical value , electron - positron pairs can be created from the vacuum by the applied field in a vacuum decay process known as the schwinger effect @xcite .",
    "this nonperturbative effect can not be observed in high energy experiments as the required critical electric field is inaccessible in the laboratory .",
    "the analogous effect in graphene is the nonperturbative creation of electron - hole pairs by an external electric field in a sample with fermi energy at the dirac point . for a supercritical coulomb field ,",
    "pair creation is signaled by the existence of `` atomic collapse '' states @xcite , which have been recently observed around impurities in graphene @xcite . in a uniform electric field ,",
    "the created pairs are accelerated by the field and contribute to the dc conductivity @xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative creation of electron - hole pairs in a strong uniform electric field @xmath1 gives rise to a superlinear current - voltage @xmath2@xmath3 characteristic with @xmath4 @xcite , which corresponds to a direct manifestation of the schwinger pair creation rate in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "superlinear @xmath2@xmath3 characteristics were observed in low - mobility graphene samples near the dirac point , with a transition to a linear regime in high - mobility samples , and this behavior was consistently interpreted in terms of an interplay between pair creation and defect scattering @xcite , but a more realistic model is required for a detailed quantitative analysis .",
    "a clear observation of the schwinger mechanism in a uniform electric field is thus still missing .    in this work , we study electron - photon interactions in graphene in the presence of a strong uniform electric field using the dirac model .",
    "our purpose is to provide a complete description of radiative processes in graphene in the regime where pair creation is relevant .",
    "the angular and frequency distribution of photon emission is a much more sensitive probe of the distribution of electrons and holes than the dc current , and may provide an alternative means of observing the schwinger effect in graphene , as suggested in @xcite . moreover , electron - hole annihilation is a source of dissipation present even in pristine graphene , and may not be negligible in clean samples at low temperature , as indicated by the results of @xcite . a detailed description of this process is thus required for the investigation of the dc conductivity in large clean graphene samples .",
    "photon emission by free electron - hole recombination in graphene was studied for a constant number of electrons and holes in @xcite , and for a time - dependent number of pairs due to pair creation in a constant electric field in @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the photon emission rate was calculated by a straightforward application of fermi s golden rule . in a strong electric field",
    "the energy of the electrons is not conserved , however , and fermi s rule can not be applied .",
    "an alternative method is thus required . here",
    "we apply standard techniques of qed with unstable vacuum @xcite to address this problem .",
    "the study of radiative processes in an electromagnetic background has an extensive bibliography ( see @xcite for references ) , and we adapt some of these results to the context of graphene physics .",
    "the studies of quantum processes in a constant electric field developed by nikishov around the 1970s are of particular relevance for our purposes @xcite . in our approach ,",
    "the electric background is treated nonperturbatively , and the interaction with the quantized electromagnetic field is considered to first order in perturbation theory .",
    "exact solutions of the dirac equation in a uniform electric field are used as unperturbed states , and the amplitudes of feynman graphs describing single photon emission are computed at tree level .",
    "these amplitudes , together with bogoliubov coefficients which describe pair creation , are the elementary blocks in the description of arbitrary first - order radiative process from many - electron states in graphene .",

    "is presented , and applied to the derivation of the photon emission rate at the dirac point .",
    "footprints of the schwinger effect in the photon emission rate are discussed at the end of this section . an appendix is included containing a review of the techniques employed in the integration of the required first - order amplitudes .",
    "in the dirac model of graphene , low - energy electronic excitations are described by dirac fields @xmath5 in two spatial dimensions . the interaction with the quantized electromagnetic field ,",
