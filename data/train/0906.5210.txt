    "we consider a chaotic metallic grain with a large dimensionless thouless conductance .",

    "the second term is the pairing interaction with coupling constant @xmath7 and the pair creation operator @xmath8 .",
    "the third term is an exchange interaction where @xmath9 is the total spin operator ( @xmath10 are pauli matrices ) and @xmath11 is the exchange coupling constant . estimated values of @xmath11 for a variety of materials were tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ origh ] ) we have omitted the charging energy term @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the capacitance of the grain and @xmath14 is the number of electrons ) since it is constant for a grain with a fixed number of electrons .",
    "the universal hamiltonian ( [ origh ] ) conserves the total spin of the grain , i.e. , @xmath15=0 $ ] .",
    "consequently , each eigenstate has a well - defined total spin @xmath16 and spin projection @xmath17 .",
    "the pairing interaction scatters pairs of spin up / down electrons from doubly occupied to empty orbitals .",
    "therefore the pairing interaction does not affect the singly occupied levels .",
    "this is known as the blocking effect and the singly occupied levels are also referred to as ` blocked levels ' . on the other hand ,",
    "these singly occupied levels are the only levels that contribute to the exchange interaction .",
    "thus , each eigenstate of ( [ origh ] ) factorizes into two parts .",
    "the first part @xmath18 is a zero spin eigenstate of the reduced bcs hamiltonian @xmath19 , and is described as a superposition of slater determinants that are constructed from the subset @xmath20 of empty and doubly occupied levels .",
    "the second part of the eigenstate , @xmath21 , is obtained by coupling the set of singly occupied levels @xmath22 , each carrying spin @xmath23 , to total spin @xmath16 and spin projection @xmath17  @xcite .",

    "for a picketfence spectrum , the renormalized coupling constant is given by @xmath36 the exchange interaction only affects the singly occupied levels , and we expect the renormalization ( [ renorm ] ) to hold as long as the number of singly occupied levels is small compared with @xmath37 . in practice ,",
    "we study the relevant observable as a function of truncated bandwidth @xmath37 and make sure that its value has converged for the largest bandwidth @xmath37 we can calculate .",
    "in this section we study the ground - state spin of the grain as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath33 .",
    "we find the lowest energy @xmath39 for a given spin @xmath16 and then minimize @xmath39 with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "the ground - state spin of the grain is determined by the competition between various terms in the hamiltonian ( [ origh ] ) . the one - body part and pairing interaction favor minimal spin , while exchange interaction favors a maximally polarized state .",
    "@xmath33 plane for an even ( left panel ) and odd ( right panel ) number of electrons .",
    "numbers denote the spin values in the corresponding sectors .",
    "we observe an intermediate regime ( sc - fm ) in which the ground state is partly polarized and partly paired . taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=336 ]    the ground - state phase diagram in the @xmath33@xmath38 plane of a grain with a picketfence single - particle spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "we find three different phases : a superconducting phase ( sc ) where the number of pairs is maximal and @xmath16 is minimal , a ferromagnetic phase ( fm ) where the system is fully polarized @xmath40 , and an intermediate regime ( sc - fm ) where exchange and pairing correlations coexist .",
    "the ground - state wave function with spin @xmath16 in the coexistence regime is described by @xmath41 singly occupied levels closest to the fermi energy while the remaining electrons are paired .",
    "the coexistence regime is bounded by two critical values @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the exchange interaction that are function of @xmath33 .",
    "the lower value @xmath42 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath33 ( stronger exchange is required to polarize a grain with stronger pairing correlations ) , while the higher value @xmath43 depends only weakly on @xmath33 .",

    "all steps have a height of @xmath52 .",
    "however , for @xmath53 , the first step has a height of @xmath54 , describing a spin jump from @xmath27 to @xmath50 .",
    "this first step starts at @xmath55 and ends at @xmath56 .",
    "the height of the first - step spin jump increases at larger values of @xmath33 .",
    "all subsequent steps are of height one .",
    "spin jumps also occur when superconductivity in metallic grains breaks down in the presence of a sufficiently large external zeeman field  @xcite .",
    "this `` softened '' first - order phase transition from a superconductor to a paramagnet was explained qualitatively using a finite - spin bcs approximation .    in the presence of exchange correlations , spin jumps are predicted to occur at @xmath57 .",
    "such exchange coupling values are significantly larger than the exchange coupling values of most metals ( see fig .  9 in ref .",
    "moreover , the exchange strength is an intrinsic material property and is difficult to tune experimentally . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the coexistence regime can be tuned to experimentally accessible values of the exchange interaction by applying an external zeeman field .",
    "the determination of the ground - state spin of a grain is a difficult measurement .",
    "it is then desirable to identify signatures of coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in a quantity that is directly measurable , e.g. , the conductance .",
    "furthermore , the universal hamiltonian ( [ origh ] ) is only valid for chaotic ( or disordered ) grains , in which mesoscopic fluctuations are generic .",
    "therefore , in order to make quantitative predictions for the experiment it is necessary to include the effect of mesocopic fluctuations . in this section",
    "we discuss the mesoscopic fluctuations of the tunneling conductance for an almost - isolated metallic grain in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "we find signatures of the coexistence of pairing and exchange correlations in the conductance statistics .",
    "since the tunneling conductance can be measured in a single - electron transistor that uses the metallic grain as an island , our results are directly relevant for the experiment .",
    "we consider grains that are weakly coupled to external leads . in the regime of sequential tunneling @xmath58 (",
    "@xmath59 is a typical tunneling width ) . assuming the charging energy to be much larger than temperature ( @xmath60 )",
    ", the conductance displays a series of sharp peaks as a function of gate voltage .",
    "the @xmath61-th conductance peak describes a tunneling event in which the number of electrons in the dot changes from @xmath61 to @xmath62 . and is determined by the many - body energies and transition rates between eigenstates of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 electrons .",
    "the conductance peak height and peak position are determined by solving a system of rate equations  @xcite .    here",
    "we present results for the conductance peak spacing and peak height statistics for an experimentally accessible temperature of @xmath63  @xcite . in the absence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian is described by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices . for each random matrix realization of the one - body hamiltonian",
    ", we use the lanczos method to find the five lowest eigenstates of the many - body hamiltonian ( [ origh ] ) .",
    "the calculations are carried out for a truncated bandwidth @xmath64 and electron numbers @xmath65 and @xmath66 . using the many - body energies and wave functions , we calculate the tunneling matrix elements for the corresponding three tunneling events .",
    "we then solve the system of rate equations and determine the conductance as a function of gate voltage . the peak position and height",
    "are determined numerically . to ensure good statistics ,",
    "the above procedure is repeated for @xmath67 realizations of the one - body hamiltonian .      the peak spacing distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ pspa ] , where the spacing is measured relative the constant charging energy . for @xmath68 and at low temperatures , this distribution is bimodal because of the spin degeneracy of the single - particle levels  @xcite .",
    "the exchange interaction induces mesoscopic spin fluctuations and suppresses this bimodality ( see top left panel of fig .",
    "[ pspa ] ) .",
    "this is known from the case of semiconductor quantum dots .     for several values of @xmath33 .",
    "results are shown for both @xmath32 ( dashed , grey - filled histograms ) and @xmath69 ( solid histograms ) .",
    "for @xmath44 we also compare with the analytic result  @xcite at @xmath70 and @xmath32 ( solid line ) .",
    "the bimodality of the distribution at @xmath68 is suppressed at finite exchange ( @xmath71 ) but is restored for @xmath72 . taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=288 ]    pairing correlations can restore bimodality . for a moderate exchange value of @xmath73 , bimodality is restored for a relatively weak pairing strength of @xmath74 . for @xmath71 , this bimodality",
    "is suppressed but reappears at @xmath72 ( see bottom left panel of fig .  [ pspa ] ) .",
    "the left part of the peak spacing distribution describes even - odd - even ( e - o - e ) tunneling events ( the parity refers to the number of electrons ) , and its right part describes odd - even - odd ( o - e - o ) transitions .",
    "the bimodality of the peak spacing distribution in the presence of strong pairing correlations can be understood qualitatively in the @xmath75 fixed - spin bcs approximation  @xcite . for an e - o - e transition",
    ", the first conductance peak corresponds to the blocking of an additional single - particle level , while the second conductance peak corresponds to the removal of this blocked level by creating an additional cooper pair .",
    "this leads to the estimate @xmath76 . in a o - e - o tunneling sequence ,",
    "these two events are reversed and we find @xmath77 .",
    "the contribution of the exchange interaction in these estimates is straightforward because , in the limit of strong pairing , the ground - state spin is always @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) for an even ( odd ) number electrons .",
    "the difference of these two peak spacing values is @xmath78 and bimodality becomes more pronounced when @xmath33 increases .",
    "since the exchange interaction strength for most metals is smaller or comparable to @xmath79 , exchange correlations are insufficient to suppress the bimodality in the presence of strong pairing correlations .     for several values of @xmath33 .",
    "we show results for @xmath32 ( dashed , grey - filled histograms ) and @xmath69 ( solid histograms ) .",
    "the solid line is the analytic distribution at @xmath80 and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "since the conductance peak height @xmath81 fluctuates over several order of magnitude , we show the distributions as a function of @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the average conductance peak height .",
    "taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=288 ]      the peak height distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ pheight ] . for @xmath68 ,",
    "this distribution is known analytically at @xmath70  @xcite , and , in the absence of an external magnetic field ( goe statistics ) , diverges at small values of the conductance .",
    "finite temperature and exchange interaction have a similar effect on the peak height distribution ; they both reduce the occurrence of small conductance values .",
    "while thermal fluctuations open an energy window in which states become available for tunneling and thus can contribute to the conductance , the exchange interaction increases the many - body density of states around the fermi energy and makes otherwise high - lying non - zero spin states available for tunneling .",
    "this effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ pheight ] .",
    "for @xmath44 we clearly observe that a finite exchange interaction suppresses the peak height distribution at small conductance values .",
    "the same behavior was observed for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) ensemble in semiconductor quantum dots , where the pairing interaction can be ignored and a closed solution for the conductance is available  @xcite .",
    "there , the suppression of probability at small conductance values by the inclusion of exchange interaction leads to better agreement with the experimental results .",
    "another signature of exchange correlations is the suppression of peak height fluctuations as described by @xmath84 ( the ratio between is the standard deviation and average value of the peak height )  @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that at very low temperatures , e.g. , @xmath85 , the small conductance values are no longer suppressed by an exchange interaction . for such very low temperatures ,",
    "the increase in the density of states near the fermi energy by the exchange interaction does not affect the conductance since only the ground state contributes significantly to transport .",
    "the pairing interaction leads to an excitation gap that pushes states with large spin to higher energies .",
    "thus , already for @xmath86 we observe less suppression of the small conductance values by an exchange of @xmath87 .",
    "when the pairing interaction is strong enough to suppress all spin polarization of low - lying states ( e.g. , @xmath88 for @xmath89 ) , the peak height distribution becomes essentially independent of the exchange interaction and diverges again for small conductance values .    for @xmath72 and @xmath90",
    ", we observe a signature of pairing correlations in the peak spacing distribution ( bimodality ) and a signature of exchange correlations in the peak height distribution ( suppression of the probability of small conductance values ) .",
    "we can interpret these results to describe the mesoscopic coexistence of pairing and exchange correlations .",
    "a candidate for this mesoscopic coexistence is vanadium , which has @xmath91  @xcite and is superconducting in the bulk .",
    "another candidate is platinum , which has @xmath92 and is superconducting in granular form .",
    "we reviewed the competition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in ultra - small metallic grain .",
    "in particular , we presented the ground - state phase diagram in the @xmath93 plane , and discussed a coexistence regime of superconductivity and ferromagnetism .",
    "this regime is characterized by spin jumps that are greater than unity .",
    "we also discussed the transport properties of the grain in its coulomb blockade regime of weak coupling to leads and described the statistics of the conductance peaks in the presence of both pairing and exchange correlations .",
    "of particular interest is a regime in which pairing and ferromagnetic correlations coexist .",
    "such a regime is defined by the simultaneous occurrence of bimodality in the peak spacing distribution ( caused by pairing correlations ) and the suppression of the peak height distribution at small conductance values ( caused by ferromagnetic correlations ) .",
    "the exchange interaction strength is a material constant and might be difficult to tune experimentally .",
    "alternatively , the coexistence regime can be controlled by an external zeeman field while measurements are carried out at a fixed exchange interaction strength .",
