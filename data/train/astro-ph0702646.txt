    "dwarf galaxies are the most common class of galaxy in the universe , which gives them significance far beyond their mass .",
    "they are simpler in structure and perhaps more easily understood than giant galaxies , and so their study can shed light on the processes governing galaxy evolution .",
    "dwarf galaxies are also important to cosmology , because they are similar in mass to predictions for the proto - galactic fragments that collapse hierarchically to form giant galaxies .",
    "one of the most interesting testable predictions to come from numerical simulations of galaxy formation in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology is that after the universe is reionized at redshifts @xmath5 @xmath26 , galaxies of total mass @xmath610@xmath7 m@xmath8 are prevented from further accretion of gas by photoionization feedback from the cosmic ultraviolet background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this _ may _ strongly impact a dwarf s evolution , but observational evidence is inconclusive .",

    "because the relative importance of mergers and interactions as compared to intrinsic properties is not well - known , it is important to study dwarfs in as many environments as possible .",
    "therefore we have begun a hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) program to measure the complete star - formation histories ( sfh ) of six isolated local group dwarf galaxies in order to search for the imprints of cosmological processes on their evolution : the lcid ( local cosmology from isolated dwarfs ) project ( gallart et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . by measuring several small , isolated galaxies , we will test for correlations and patterns in their sfh that may provide clues as to the magnitude of the effects of reionization , supernova blowout , and other feedback processes .    here",
    "we present our first results , a new measurement of the sfh of the galaxy leo  a ( ddo  69 ) .",
    "leo  a was discovered by @xcite in the course of a search for the lowest luminosity galaxies .",
    "it is indeed one of the least luminous gas - rich galaxies known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the vital statistics of leo  a are given in table  [ tab - prop ] .",
    "leo  a is a small , blue galaxy conspicuous for its population of young , massive stars , with estimated ages from @xmath410@xmath1510@xmath7 yr @xcite .",
    "the star - formation rate ( sfr ) has apparently declined since that time , although a few small h  ii regions are present .",
    "the first hst observations of leo  a @xcite revealed a very high fraction of stars aged @xmath412  gyr at very low metallicity , suggesting that only @xmath2210% of the stellar mass was contained in older stars .",
    "@xcite obtained slightly deeper data in an offset field and measured a lower overall sfr and much higher fraaction of ancient stars : they found evidence for a median age of @xmath44  gyr , with the bulk of the old stars older than @xmath410  gyr .",
    "neither of these studies reached the necessary depth to convincingly measure the fraction and age distribution of the oldest stars .",
    "@xcite supplied the first proof of the existence of truly ancient stars in leo  a with the discovery of rr  lyrae type variables .",
    "our goal here is to provide a definitive measurement of how leo  a s sfr has varied with time over its entire lifetime .",
    "further details , including spatial patterns within leo  a , comparison to numerical models , and thorough comparison to other galaxies in our sample , will be deferred to future papers , in preparation .",
    "leo  a was observed with acs over 16 orbits during the time period 26 december 2005 to 8 january 2006 .",
    "each hst orbit was devoted to a single exposure of at least 2400 seconds duration , split to facilitate cosmic ray removal .",
    "we chose the filter pair f475w ( sloan @xmath23 ) and f814w ( broad i ) as having the best combination of throughput and temperature sensitivity for f ",
    "g type dwarfs .",
    "our paramount concern in designing the observations was to achieve the maximum possible depth of photometry , so that our conclusions would be as free as possible from difficult - to - characterize systematics .",
    "we used small dithers between exposures to allow us to correct for hot pixels in the detector , and observed when the sun - target angle was over 100@xmath24 .",
    "the total exposure time in ( f475w , f814w ) was ( 19,200 , 19,520 ) seconds .",
    "the leo  a field is shown in figure [ fig - map ] , where the left panel shows a mosaic of images from the sloan digital sky survey ( fourth data release ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , centered on the galaxy .",
    "the footprint of our acs observation is marked by the red square , while the cyan ellipse shows the approximate location of the holmberg radius .",
    "it is important to remember that a low surface density sheet of red giant stars extends out to @xmath47@xmath25 @xcite , and in the outer reaches of the galaxy the ratio of young to old stars must be significantly lower than what we find here for the center of leo  a.    the pipeline - processed data were combined using multidrizzle to eliminate cosmic rays , and photometered using dolphot , a version of hstphot @xcite incorporating the best available acs calibrations .",
    "extended objects and residual hot pixels were rejected based on their brightness profiles , leaving 112,000 well - measured stars in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "artificial star tests show that the typical photometric error reaches @xmath130.1 mag for ( m@xmath0 , m@xmath1 ) = ( 28.7 , 27.9 ) ; the 50% completeness limit is at ( m@xmath0 , m@xmath1 ) = ( 29.0 , 27.9 ) .",
    "the cmd is shown in figure  [ fig - cmd ] . where the density of stars is high enough to confound the easy estimation of the relative number of stars in the various sequences , we have plotted contours corresponding to stellar density rather than individual stars .",
    "the contours cover the range from 8512 stars / decimag@xmath26 , evenly spaced by factors of 2 .",
    "this allows both the overall density distribution as well as the fine structure of the principal sequences to be shown in a single figure .    the main features which bear on the measurement of the star - formation history , especially at the previously ill - constrained earliest times , are the relatively bright locations of the peak density of subgiants and the main - sequence turnoff ; the underdeveloped horizontal branch and strong , vertically extended red clump ; and the paucity of upper red giant branch stars .",
    "the implication of the bright subgiant branch is immediately evident by comparison to the location of the old , metal - poor isochrone in fig .",
    "[ fig - cmd ] : 14  gyr old stars would produce a far fainter subgiant branch than observed .",
    "the peak density of subgiants occurs at m@xmath1 @xmath4 @xmath31.9 , more than half a magnitude brighter than comparable measurements in globular clusters of similar metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but similar to intermediate - age clusters in the small magellanic cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and well - matched to isochrones with ages @xmath225  gyr .",
    "this is striking because a constant sfr produces a steep and monotonic increase in subgiant density with age ( e.g. , fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "because our photometry reaches the oldest main - sequence turnoff , we can unambiguously quantify the galaxy s youth for the first time .",
    "the quantitative star - formation history of a stellar population can be derived from a cmd by comparison of the distribution of stars predicted by an ensemble of theoretical models , corrected for the effects of distance , interstellar reddening , and the completeness and precision limits imposed by the observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the model predictions are derived from theoretical isochrones plus a prescription for the intital mass function and the influence of unresolved binary stars .",
    "the adopted isochrone sets have been created in the acs / wfc filter system ( l. girardi , private communication ) , so no transformation of our photometry was required .",
    "the variation of sfr with time and the evolution of stellar metallicity are taken from the combination of parameters that results in the best reproduction of the cmd .",
    "the `` best - fit '' synthetic cmd is quantified by a @xmath27-like statistic derived from the definition of the maximum likelihood for the case of poisson - distributed data @xcite .",
    "we adopt a simulated annealing approach to the minimization problem @xcite , in order to find the best cmd without searching all of parameter space , while avoiding false local minima .",
    "an example of the type of local minima encountered in this problem is the range of solutions produced by age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "our implementation of the procedure ( by a.a.c . ) is described in @xcite .",
    "our recent tests using various independent algorithms have proven that for data of high quality , the details of the fitting procedure do not strongly affect the derived sfh ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and aparicio & hidalgo , in preparation ) .",
    "the critical parameters ( m@xmath11m)@xmath12 and e(b@xmath11v ) were taken from the sources in table  [ tab - prop ] .",
    "the solutions shown here were obtained using isochrones from @xcite and the imf from @xcite .",
    "extinction in the acs / wfc filter system was obtained by interpolation within the tables of @xcite : a@xmath1 = 0.039 , a@xmath0 = 0.078 .",
    "we solved for the sfh in 9 age bins ; the age bins are logarithmically spaced to reflect the physical reality that the separation between isochrones of different ages is a strongly decreasing function of age . within each age bin ,",
    "a range of metallicities was allowed , from the lowest available metallicity to a value slightly higher than that corresponding to the @xcite metallicity : 0.0001 @xmath28 z @xmath28 0.0015 .",
    "the only constraint on age - metallicity relation was to exclude the lowest metallicity isochrones from the youngest age bins , as they are seen by inspection to be mismatched to the data .",
    "to restrict ourselves to inferences drawn from the best - modelled phases of stellar evolution , we use only the main - sequence and subgiant branch in our likelihood calculation .",
    "this does not significantly change the derived sfh because we include @xmath2990% of all stars , most of the excluded stars have very little age - sensitivity , and their colors are strongly model - dependent .",
    "our derived history of star formation in leo  a is shown in figure  [ fig - sfh ] .",
    "the best - fit sfh is shown for two different age binnings solid squares and open squares , respectively .",
    "each point carries its 1@xmath30 errorbar in sfr and an age errorbar marking the width of the age bin .",
    "the heavy curve is a cubic spline fit to the results ; it represents our best estimate of the form of the sfh in the central part of leo  a. because the total number of stars is fixed by the data , increasing the sfr in one age bin demands a decrease in the adjacent bin(s ) .",
    "consequently , the errorbars in fig .",
    "[ fig - sfh ] imply that a slightly older , broader sfr peak is allowed by the data .",
    "the derived rates apply to the acs / wfc field of view , which covers 0.6  kpc@xmath31 at a distance of 795  kpc ; this is @xmath447% of the area within the holmberg radius , and @xmath429% of the area of leo  a s intermediate - age disk @xcite .",
    "the redshift scale at top applies to a flat @xmath32cdm universe with parameters taken from the wmap year-3 dataset @xcite .",
    "the stellar evolution and cosmological clocks disagree at early times because of missing physics in the stellar models .",
    "the most important of these is gravitational diffusion settling of light elements , which reduces the ages of low - mass stars by 1020% @xcite .",
    "both solutions were obtained with fixed values of distance modulus , reddening , and binary star properties .",
    "we tested the sensitivity of the derived solution to reasonable variations in these parameters , and found that for all reasonable parameter choices , the derived sfh has the same general form , because of the exceptional photometric depth and completeness ( cole et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "leo  a is best described as a late - blooming galaxy , in which the great majority of stars are formed after a delay of several gyr .",
    "the apparent early peak of star formation above a subsequent minimum is not a high - confidence feature , as the errorbars indicate .    the derived metallicity evolution is not plotted in figure  [ fig - sfh ] because there is almost no trend with age .",
    "a constant heavy element mass fraction z = 0.0008@xmath33 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 @xmath111.4 @xmath130.2 ; ranges represent the rms scatter at a given age ) is an adequate representation of the results , although there is some hint of a trend of increasing metallicity with time , from z = 0.0006 to z = 0.001 .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , leo  a is a predominantly young galaxy .",
    "however , the depth of our photometry allows us to much more precisely describe its stellar age distribution : within the acs / wfc field of view , 90% of the star formation has occurred more recently than 8  gyr ago . the current star formation rate of @xmath410@xmath21 m@xmath8 yr@xmath34 is in good agreement with the rates estimated from h@xmath35 emission .",
    "the large number of stars above the 5  gyr isochrone shows that the sfr increased dramatically around this time and continued at high level for @xmath43  gyr before declining .",
    "however , _ some _ truly ancient stars are required to reproduce the observed cmd and provide the observed rr  lyraes .",
    "the 14  gyr isochrone in fig .",
    "[ fig - cmd ] traces the lower envelope of subgiant stars , confirming that not _ all _ of the star formation was delayed .    integrating over the radial profile from @xcite , we find that leo  a only astrated @xmath2212@xmath2010@xmath36 m@xmath8 at ages corresponding to redshifts @xmath37 .",
    "if all of its present - day baryon inventory was present at high redshift , then leo  a would have been 95% gas and only 5% stars prior to @xmath382 .",
    "although extreme , the m()/l@xmath39 ratio of the young leo  a would have been comparable to those of the most gas - rich dwarf irregular systems seen today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . evidently some small galaxies can retain or build large gas reservoirs without much depletion by star formation .",
    "this makes leo  a - like objects intriguing candidates for proto - galactic fragments that merge into giant galaxies , prompting bursts of star formation without leaving much stellar residue in their halos .",
    "because of uncertainties in assigning _ absolute _ ages to old stellar populations , and because our time resolution decreases with age , we can not rule out that all of the ancient star formation in leo  a took place prior to reionization .",
    "that would require compressing all of the ancient star formation in fig .",
    "[ fig - sfh ] , plus the formation of the unobserved pop  iii stars that enriched the galaxy to its `` initial '' metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath4 @xmath111.5 , into an @xmath220.5  gyr window .",
    "leo  a is not the only `` late bloomer '' in the local group , but it appears to be an extreme case .",
    "an example of a qualitatively similar sfh can be found in the leo  i @xcite dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy .",
    "the two galaxies are of comparable mass , but the latter is a gas - free , bound satellite of the milky way , with plausible triggers for late star formation in tidal interactions or accretion events .",
    "a trigger in the case of leo  a is harder to identify .",
    "the idea that a dwarf galaxy s sfr is tied only to the gas infall rate would require an unusual merger history for this tiny , isolated system .",
    "leo  a would have gained virtually all of its gas in the past few gyr : not enough time for it to have gotten to its present remote location from the vicinity of m31 or the milky way where encounters might be expected to be more likely .",
    "given its probable long history of isolation , it may be that much of the gas in leo  a was present from early on , and therefore the suppression of early star formation is not attributable to the loss or exhaustion of its initial reservoir .",
    "it seems more plausible that only a small fraction of the was able to participate in star formation , with the rest kept warm in a halo ; the uv background or supernova feedback are candidate heat sources .",
    "sequestering most of the gas in a halo also speeds the chemical evolution clock , which is interesting given the prompt enrichment and subsequent flat age - metallicity relation in the galaxy .",
    "the warm halo would have been diffuse and metal - poor , resulting in a long cooling timescale and a possible delay before it could participate in star formation perhaps triggered by a rare infall or interaction event in this isolated dwarf .",
