    "the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters is currently believed to go through two major phases : in the first , usually referred to as violent relaxation ( lynden - bell 1967 ) , the evolution is controlled by a collective potential and results in a maxwell velocity distribution of galaxies ; in the second , the dynamics is dominated by two - body processes , and binary ( both elastic and inelastic ) collisions drive the evolution .",
    "in fact , in this latter phase , for ordinary galaxy sizes and separations the collision time scale is much less than the hubble time .",
    "although a complete theoretical description of the two - body phase of dynamical evolution of clusters is still lacking , observations , n - body simulations and computation based on statistical methods ( monte carlo and fokker - plank simulations ) have concurred in enlightening many dynamical properties of clusters in this stage .",
    "such properties are characterized by a large cluster - to - cluster variance , and include the following : the presence of a _ velocity bias _",

    "in previous papers ( fusco - femiano @xmath4 menci 1995 , hereafter paper i ; menci & fusco - femiano 1996 , hereafter paper ii ) we showed that the loss of kinetic energy in inelastic galaxy collisions ( binary aggregations ) in clusters with @xmath5 km / s can significantly change the velocity distribution of galaxies .",
    "the model not only simultaneously accounts for the velocity bias and for centrally decreasing velocity dispersion profiles , but also predicts a correlation of such effects with the shape ( the core radius ) and the depth ( the dark matter velocity dispersion ) of the cluster potential wells in good agreement with observations . in addition , the aggregation model can succesfully connect the above dynamical effects to other observed properties of galaxy clusters ( paper i ) , such as the @xmath0-parameter ( expressing the ratio of the galaxy orbital specific energy to the specific energy of the x - ray emitting plasma ) and the butcher - oemler effect ( see cavaliere & menci 1993 ) .",
    "thus , aggregations seem to constitute a leading mechanism in the post - virialization phase of clusters with velocity dispersion @xmath6 km / s , while in larger clusters , they are highly suppressed due to the large galaxy relative velocities ( see numerical results by richstone & malmuth 1993 ) . to further assess the role of galaxy merging in the two - body dynamical phase , we address here the problem of luminosity segregation ( hereafter ls ) .",
    "this is expected to be generated when aggregations are effective , since merging builds up larger galaxies mainly in the central regions , where the larger density favours binary aggregation .",
    "thus , we extend our treatement of galaxy inelastic collisions , based on the solution of a collisional boltzmann - liuoville equation , to include position - dependent mass spectra of interacting galaxies . the prediction of our model will be compared with observational results , focussing on the correlation of the segregation effects with the properties of the clusters such as the richness , the density distribution and the velocity dispersion .",

    "since our aim is to probe the effectiveness of interaction in producing mass segregation , we indroduce some approximations ( a discussion on them is given in the final section ) .",
    "first , we assume the velocity distribution to be independent on the mass and on the spatial distribution of galaxies , so that the distribution in eq .",

    "such approximation does not actually hold ( see paper i ) but , as we discuss in the final section , for our purpose in the present paper it is a _ conservative _ assumption .",

    "the efficiency @xmath35 is determined from n - body results ( see richstone & malmuth 1993 ) and is zero when @xmath36 , so that aggregations are highly suppressed in very rich clusters .",

    "the adopted value of @xmath44 correspond to a circular velocity of @xmath78 km / s ; such value is consistent with that derived from the faber - jackson relation for an @xmath39 galaxy , and with the measurements by tonry & davis ( 1981 ) ; dressler ( 1984 ) ; dressler ( 1987 ) . the adopted value of @xmath43 ( which refers to the dark halo of an @xmath39 galaxy ) is a conservative one , when compared with observational results from absorption lines , measured by steidel ( 1995 ) ; lanzetta et al .",

    "when aggregations are effective , the final mass distribution will be changed from the initial one only in the central core where the galaxy density is larger and binary aggregations are favoured .",

    "the evolution of the mass distribution at different radii in a typical cluster ( with @xmath84 , @xmath85 km / s and @xmath86 kpc ) is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the distribution flattens in the central region due to the disappearence of small galaxies which aggregate to form larger ones . since aggregations between galaxies",
    "cause a loss of orbital kinetic energy , we expect such effect to be correlated with galaxy velocity dispersions smaller in the central regions , i.e. , with velocity profiles falling toward the center ( as we discussed in paper ii ) ; this is actually the case , as is shown in figure 2 .",
    "a further effect is that brighter galaxies ( which form from mainly in the central , denser regions ) will have smaller relative separations .",
    "this latter effect is that observed in several clusters , as we discuss in the next session .",
    "the strenght of the above effects depends on the cluster properties , which , in our model , enter only through @xmath52 , @xmath3 and @xmath50 as is shown by eqs .",
    "e.g. , for given @xmath52 and @xmath3 , in clusters with large @xmath50 merging will be less effective ( see the merging rate in eq .",

    ", the distributions @xmath112 will be peaked at smaller separations for brighter magnitude ranges @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "such shift of the peak with @xmath89 $ ] can be expressed by the ratio @xmath113 of the average distances of the brightest class to that of the faintest class .",
    "the distributions @xmath112 for the different clusters are shown in fig .",
    "the ratio @xmath114 is shown in table 2 for our predictions and for the corresponding observations .",
    "the agreement with observations is remarkable .",
    "the different degrees of segregation ( expressed by values @xmath115 ) observed in the sample is well accounted for by our merging model , and is directly related to the cluster characteristics as follows : for a given total number of galaxies @xmath52 , clusters with small core radii have denser central regions , so that aggregations are more effective and segregation is enhanced .",
    "the lack of ls in a2111 is explained in terms of large core radius coupled with a limited total number of galaxies . as a confirm to such an interpretation",
    ", we observe that the more pronounced segregation takes place in a2670 which is characterized by the smallest core radius in the sample .",
    "however , ls can occur also in clusters with large @xmath50 if the total number of galaxies @xmath52 is large enough or if @xmath3 is very low .",
    "in fact , the cluster 0004.8 - 3450 shows a significant ls due to @xmath116 , while the segregation in the fornax cluster is mostly due to its very low velocity dispersion @xmath3=320 km / s .",
    "note the peculiarity of cluster a2218 .",
    "the model is in very good agreement for what concerns the observed ls of the two brightest magnitude classes with respect to the third one .",
    "however , the real data show that the two brightest classes are characterized by an anti - segregation between them , which is not accounted for by our model .",
    "we attribute such mismatch to substructures / anisotropies which our model ( based on the schematic assumption of isotropy ) can not reproduce . in fact , recent analysis ( squires et al .",
    "1996 ) of a2218 indicates the presence of collision of subclumps , with associated elongated structures in the plasma disposition .    as observed above ,",
    "our model predicts the aggregating galaxies to loose part of their kinetic energy .",
    "the brightest galaxies in a cluster showing segregation are then expected to have velocity dispersion profiles decreasing toward the center , where the larger density favours aggregations .",
    "the computed result for the galaxies belonging to the magnitude classes 1 and 2 in a2670 ( see figure 4 ) confirm such expectation and are consistent with the available data for such cluster ( sharples , ellis , & gray 1988 ; see also yepes & dominguez - tenreiro 1992 ) .",
    "the same calculation for a2111 ( see figure 4 ) shows no positive gradient in the profiles , which is the counterpart of the lack of luminosity segregation .",
    "actually , both effects are tightly connected in our model .      here",
    "we discuss the effects of variations of the input parameters with respect to the reference values in table 1 .",
    "the segregation parameter @xmath114 decreases ( indicating larger segregation ) for increasing @xmath106 , and for decreasing @xmath3 and @xmath50 ( i.e. , for increasing merging efficiency ) .",
    "however the variations with @xmath106 and @xmath3 are very mild .",
    "this makes our results _ robust _ with respect to the errors associated to those parameters : a 20 @xmath117 error in @xmath106 or in @xmath3 results in @xmath118 .",
    "the errors in @xmath50 are more important : @xmath119 yields @xmath120 .",
    "the results for ls do depend on the @xmath105 ratio which for the sake of simplicity , we assumed to be constant .",
    "however , the main results presented here holds also for @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 5 , where we show the distance distribution functions ( for the parameters of cluster a2670 ) derived from the _ same _ dynamics ( i.e. , with the same mass segregation ) but with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we have shown that a detailed model for the dynamics of galaxies aggregating in the potential wells of clusters predicts luminosity segregation ( ls ) effects of the kind observed in real clusters .",
    "the correlation of the strenght of the effect with the properties of the clusters predicted in our model is in agreement ( see figure 3 and table 2 ) with that observed for the limited sample of clusters for which ls has been subject to accurate quantitative measurements . in particular",
    ", we predict the effectiveness of aggregations , and hence the degree of ls , to be directly correlated with the number of galaxies in the cluster and inversely correlated with the core radius and with the velocity dispersion ( see eq .",
    "the results do not depend on the detail of the initial mass distribution of galaxies in clusters , which we assume to have a press & shechter form with spectral parameter @xmath125 ; such independency is due to the properties of the asymptotic solution of the smoluchowski equation ( describing the evolution of the position - dependent galaxy mass function in our model ) and can be traced back to the non - linear nature of such equation .",
    "our results are robust with respect to uncertainties in the input quantities and to the adopted @xmath126 , as shown in sect .",
    "3.3 . as for our assumption of fixed galaxy velocity distribution",
    ", this does not hold when aggregations are effective ( see paper i and ii ) .",
    "however , the merging - induced shift of @xmath127 of the velocity dispersion toward smaller values _ increases _ the efficiency of aggregations , so that our assumption is actually conservative .",
    "we have re - run our computation for shifted velocity distributions and found results almost indistinguishable from those presented here .",
    "finally , we stress that no attempt of parameter optimization has been performed .",
    "an even better agreement could be found if the cluster parameters were suitable tuned .    as for the big picture of the evolution of cluster in the two - body dynamical phase ,",
    "our model focus on the effects of inelastic collisions not considered in previous works on this subject . in particular ,",
    "the fokker - plank approach by yepes & dominguez - tenreiro ( 1992 ) considers only elastic collisions by means of a `` mean field '' approximation with the input parameters chosen from a grid of models to show that , within the set of models , it is possible to match the observed segregation effects .    here",
    "we solve the collisional boltzmann equation including inelastic collisions , using , for the input model parameters , the _ measured _ values .",
    "though the latter are subject to errors , we showed ( in sect .",
    "3.3 ) that the model is robust to uncertainties @xmath128 in the parameters .",
    "our results show that inelatic collisions produce appreciable dynamical effects for clusters with one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath6 km / s .",
    "such effects show up in different but connected observables : the velocity bias ( due to the _ average _ loss of kinetic energy in inelastic collisions ) @xmath129 can be observed in x - rays in the form of @xmath0-parameter ( see cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) @xmath130 ; centrally rising velocity dispersion profiles ( due to the _ differential _ loss of kinetic energy at different radii ) are now being measured with great accuracy in the optical ( girardi et al .",

    "( 1996 ) of a sample of 37 clusters , when clusters with prominent substructures are excluded ; however , the detection of such correlation from the data ( see also den hartog , & katgert , 1996 ) is made difficult by the presence of anisotropies and/or substructures , which can hurt or destroy the effect of the inelastic collision in the two - body relaxation phase .",
    "as for the ls , the mild ( inverse ) dependence on @xmath3 of the ls effect from merging makes difficult to observe such correlation .",
    "however , in our model , the strong inverse correlation of ls with @xmath50 predicted by our model is confirmed the data analysis by yepes , dominguez - tenreiro & del pozo - sanz ( 1991 ) on the very limited sample of clusters .",
    "ls data for a larger sample of cluster with measured @xmath50 would definitely clarify the issue .    finally , we note that the correlations between different but connected observables predicted by the aggregation model makes it testable already at the present stage of observational capabilities .",
