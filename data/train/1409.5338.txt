    "schrdinger wrote that `` in einstein s theory of gravitation matter and its dynamical interaction are based on the notion of an intrinsic geometric structure of the space - time continuum''@xcite . in this article",
    "we conjecture the reverse statement , i.e. that the intrinsic geometric structure of spacetime is based on the very notion of matter and its dynamical interaction . the idea that spacetime is not fundamental but emergent has been proposed in the past by several authors  @xcite .",
    "however we start from pure logical reasoning based on the distinction of variables and constants , i.e. from the ( onto-)logic of time .    our motivation results from typical claims in standard textbooks like ( for instance ) the following concerning the schrdinger equation  @xcite : `` it is quite clear that no deductive reasoning can lead us to that equation .",
    "like all equations in mathematical physics , it must be postulated and its only justification lies in the success of the comparison of its predictions with the experimental results '' . apparently this statement suggests that internal coherence in physics as a whole is impossible and not worth to be considered .",
    "another example was found in an older ( outdated )",
    "german edition of goldstein s _ classical mechanics _",
    ", where he remarks that `` there is no intrinsic connection between quantum mechanics and relativity '' and further `` one can discuss the consequences of the one theory without referring to the other ''  .",
    "again , the unity of physics and the unity of nature went casually overboard . both cites contain ( independent of their truth ) philosophical rather than physical statements .",
    "they make ontological claims but do nt explicitely mark them  .",
    "such statements suggest that nature is essentially not intelligible ( i.e. laws have to be postulated ) and that physics is unable to yield fundamental understanding .",
    "if this was correct , then the postulates of one area of physics are not intrinsically connected to other areas of physics .",
    "however there are counterexamples to this attitude .",
    "the most famous is certainly newton s law of gravitation .",
    "it s kernel is _ unification _ : he invented a common description of falling apples and planetary motion and thus revealed the unity of nature underlying the apparent variety of phenomena .",
    "we take this as our guiding idea : to reveal a formalism that connects classical and quantum mechanics as well as relativity and electrodynamics . and ideally we find a basic but logically consistent explanation for this formalism with a minimal number of postulates .",
    "thus - at startup - we reject all merely postulated concepts such as mass , point particles , wave functions and even spacetime .",
    "we intend to derive and explain the concepts instead of just postulating them . but",
    "what then is left as starting point to do physics with ?",
    "it is the very idea of physics itself : it is essential to physics to observe and measure quantities as functions of time .",
    "a physical theory is a mathematical description of observations called physical law .",
    "this concept is meaning- and useful because of repeatability .",
    "originating in astronomy physics intends to recognize the pattern of repetitions , i.e. that under similar ( or the same ) conditions we observe similar ( or the same ) facts .",
    "a physical law is ( in combination with the starting conditions ) the mathematical form of a prediction - based on the analysis of experiments . though this is a strongly simplified description of physics , it adresses fundamental ontological commitments : the possibility of measurements , the existence of quantities in time , repeatability , the possibility of experimental preparation with all its implications and last but not least pattern recognition .",
    "therefore physics is irresolvably committed to time , to ( measurements of ) quantities and to the experience that there are quantifyable aspects of reality that can be described by physical laws in mathematical form .",
    "this is not a postulate , it is a _ conditio sine qua non_. even if we leave all other philosophical questions away - physics as an experimental science is founded on these ontological commitments .",
    "the idea of this essay is to investigate how far this concept reaches , i.e. what physics can be derived from these first principles . and it may surprise how far this ansatz reaches : it allows to draw conclusions about the dimensionality of spacetime , lorentz transformations , the lorentz force , maxwell s equations , central statements of quantum mechanics ( i.e. that mass is a frequency ) and the dirac equation .",
    "most equations that we use should be well - known and the math used is simple .",
    "however we havent found the story that we are going to tell elsewhere in this form .",
    "the unity of nature is our first and main premise : to be part of the world implies ( direct or indirect ) possibility in principle of interaction with all other things that are part of the world and therefore we ( have to ) presume the existence of a common denominator , a fundamental level .",
    "physical models are based on a quantitative description of reality .",
    "hence whatever a physical theory considers to be fundamental must be representable by quantities .",
    "secondly the physical description of fundamental entities has to reflect that these entities exists in time . since variation is the only method to express existence in time , any variable that represents a fundamental entity has to vary at all times .",
    "however quantities and their developement in time are not sufficient to make up a physical theory .",
    "we also need an interpretation that maps quantities of the model to measurable quantities in the world .",
    "this is what makes up physical meaning : physics as an experimental science can only assign meaning to measurable entities .",
    "the possibility of a measurement presupposes the existence of two quantities of the same dimension , one that varies ( called the observable ) and second that stays constant - the ruler or the `` reference '' .",
    "if we measure a length , there must be some fixed length ( historically it was the prototype meter ) that we use as reference .",
    "this means that for a measurement we have to find both , varying and constant quantities ( of the same type or unit ) on this fundamental level .",
    "that is , if all fundamental entities vary , then there is no constant quantity that might serve as a measurement ruler . hence on the fundamental level quantities can not be measured .",
    "however if quantities can not be measured , they can not be physically interpreted . of cause",
    "there might be functions of the fundamental variables that are constant in time : such constants all usually called constants of motion ( coms ) .",
    "but these functions do not include linear terms - otherwise it is easy to show that the functions can not be constants . hence the dimension ( unit ) of these functions is different from the dimension ( unit ) of the fundamental variables and they do not serve as rulers .    according to quantum mechanics ( qm )",
    "the fundamental level is identical to ( the components of ) the wavefunction .",
    "this fits surprisingly well to what we just said about fundamental variables and it yields a simple but fundamental explaination why the components of wave functions vary at all times .",
    "it also explains why the quantummechanical wave function implies an interpretational problem and why qm has to postulate that measurement devices must be `` classical '' or `` macroscopic '' .",
    "there is no doubt that we can measure distances and angles .",
    "hence space ( or spacetime ) is not fundamental , but has to be constructed .",
    "this is not only a consequence of our presumptions but it is also desireable : only if it is possible to _ derive _ the properties of spacetime , we can explain its properties from first principles .",
    "if we instead consider spacetime to be fundamental we are obliged to postulate its properties . as we are going to argue it is possible to construct spacetime from the isomorphism of a lie algebra with ( reps of ) real clifford algebras @xmath0 .",
    "hence the perception of spacetime is a result of pattern recognition in analogy to the perception of sound as language and music .",
    "we should always be aware that physically there just sound , i.e. a density fluctuation with time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_setup ] we describe our understanding of fundamental entities in physics . in sec .",
    "[ sec_constants ] we derive hamilton s equations of motion ( eqom ) and the basic properties of the symplectic unit matrix . in sec .",
    "[ sec_sigma ] constants of motion are introduced with the help of lax pairs .",
    "we review important algebraic relations that indicate the construction principles of spacetime : the possible congruence of the algebraic structure of ( skew- ) hamiltonian matrices with the basic elements ( i.e. generators ) of clifford algebras .",
    "we describe the basic measurable entities in a world based on time : ( second ) moments of fundamental variables .",
    "since second moments can be represented by expectation values of matrix operators , the relations between these matrices are the relations between the observables ( i.e. the laws of physics ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_geom ] we derive the conditions for the emergence of a geometric space from symplectic dynamics .",
    "observables are expectation values of matrix operators and hence spacetime geometry should be representable by a system of basic matrices with certain properties . such matrix systems indeed exist and are known as ( representations of ) clifford algebras .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_structure ] we describe symplectic transformations as structure preserving transformations .",
    "these transformations are isomorph to lorentz transformations and are the basis for the apparent geometry of spacetime .",
    "we explore the meaning of structure defining transformations .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_clifford ] we give a short overview over the basic properties of clifford algebras in general and especially of @xmath1 .",
    "we derive conditions that limit the possible dimensionality of an emergent spacetime .",
    "further analysis of the properties of these clifford algebras allows to restrict spacetime to 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "hence the appropriate algebra is the algebra of the real dirac matrices .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_relativity ] we describe lorentz transformations - boosts and rotations - as structure preserving ( symplectic ) transformations .",
    "we present an interpretation of the dirac matrix system called the `` electromechanical equivalence '' ( emeq ) .",
    "guided by the emeq we derive the lorentz force and maxwell s equations ( mweqs ) .",
    "we give arguments why momentum and energy should be related to spatial- and time - derivatives and finally we scetch the path towards the dirac equation .",
    "[ sec_outlook ] finalizes the discussion and a summary in given in sec .",
    "[ sec_summary ] .",
    "in a fundamental theory the variables are supposed to represent entities of physical reality and hence they are entities that are characterized by their existence in time .",
    "the only way to physically describe existence in time is by variation : the brickstones of the physical aspects of reality are quantities that continuously vary  ) are `` objects '' of the physical world , but objects of a physical ( mathematical ) theory . ] .",
    "since quantum theory postulates that the wavefunction is fundamental , it is obvious that the components of the wavefunction are identical to what we call fundamental variable .",
    "a meaningful answer to the question _ what _ varies requires some constant entity to compare , i.e. a reference for a measurement . if we say that an entity represented by a variable in our equation is a length then we need to have , in principle , a unit ( for instance the meter ) to refer to .",
    "not only that this reference has to be of the same type ( i.e. dimension ) , but it also has to be macroscopic as `` meaning '' can only be derived from everyday ( macroscopic ) experience .",
    "the copenhagen interpretation avoids the reference problem by assigning an only probabilistic meaning to the wavefunction , i.e. by postulating that a ) there is no direct physical meaning and b ) the wavefunction gives a complete description of reality , i.e. is fundamental .",
    "most discussions of the copenhagen interpretation are focused on the question , if the probability interpretation is correct and if the probability is `` classical '' or `` quantum '' in nature .",
    "we do not adress this question .",
    "our claim is , that _ if _ the wavefunction is truely fundamental , then a meaningful _ physical _ interpretation of the wavefunction is impossible  .",
    "physical meaning depends on a constant quantity that could serve as a reference . and",
    "the lack of reference is a logical consequence of fundamentality .",
    "there is no meaningful answer to the question _ what _ varies , but only _ how _ the fundamental variables vary .",
    "this is a logical limit in physics : a measurement requires a reference , i.e. something constant of the same physical dimension .",
    "we measure length in `` meter '' and a measurement of length is a comparison of an unknown and varying quantity with a constant quantity ( `` the meter '' ) .",
    "but since existence is essentially being in time , constant quantities that could serve as a reference have to be constructed from a process committed to time , i.e. by variation . hence the only possible _ physically real _ constants are constants of motion : the prototype meter is an object composed of atoms and molecules which consist of `` elementary particles '' .",
    "the motion of these components is stable and the length of the reference object `` meter '' is a constant of motion of these particles .",
    "but at the level of these particles - or at the level of their constituents - at some level we find pure variation .",
    "acuminated we conclude that if it is possible to directly measure ( the value of ) a variable , it can not be fundamental .    thus if physical entities that are considered to be fundamental , they can not be directly measured , since this would require constants of motion from `` more '' fundamental entities .",
    "but then the more fundamental variable could not be measured etcpp .",
    "it is impossible to assign physical meaning to truely fundamental dynamical variables . in this respect",
    "fundamental variables are not identical to degrees of freedom ( dofs ) in classical mechanics as dofs are usually assumed to be measurable at least in principle . but in most other aspects fundamental variables are similar to ( dofs ) in classical mechanics and this includes the possibility of a classical description of the dynamics of these variables",
    ".    all fundamental variables are of the same type .",
    "as long as we have no forceful argument to introduce different types of variables , ockham s razor requires them to be all ontologically identical .",
    "we might compare this to the bits or bytes in a computer ram : they are all equal .",
    "they only differ by their address , i.e. by their position in address space .",
    "hence all fundamental variables are either all real or all imaginary .",
    "the latter might be preferable to reflect their unmeasurability , however as long as there is no need to introduce the concept of complex numbers , ockham s razor demands to stay with reals  @xcite .",
    "one might think of fundamental variables as pure pieces of information but we prefer the term `` variables '' as this name best expresses the fundamental commitment of existence to variation . and",
    "in this respect variables are intrinsically different from `` bits '' : fundamental variables do not stop varying .",
    "it follows from this logical conception that fundamental `` objects '' ( like electrons ) have to be understood by their structure .",
    "the only structure at hand is the structure of the variations of the variables - the structure of the dynamics .",
    "fundamental objects ( elementary particles ) are not directly represented by the variables , but by the dynamical structure of these variables ( the elements of a spinor ) .",
    "if objects do not change their structure ( i.e. their `` identity '' ) in some interaction , then the involved physical processes apparently must be structure preserving : if a system like an elementary particle is defined and understood by its structure , then its continuous existence requires - besides a continuous variation of its constituents ( the variables ) - that the dynamical structure must be preserved .",
    "we suggest the following axioms for an ontologically proper basis of physics are :    1 .",
    "existence happens in time .",
    "the `` time '' that we have in mind does not have to be identical to the time that an observer would measure using a clock , but we assume that there is a monotonic functional relationship .",
    "time is manifest by variation .",
    "any fundamental physical entity varies and is therefore a `` variable '' .",
    "measurements require constant references ( rulers ) , i.e. a physical world requires constants .    from these axioms",
    "it follows that    1 .",
    "there are no other ( physical ) constants than constants of motion ( coms ) .",
    "2 .   fundamental variables can not be directly measured .    the value of a single variable varies .",
    "hence a single variable can not generate constants of motion .",

    "the matrix @xmath12 has the even dimension @xmath13 : in any time - like physical world the dynamical variables come in pairs  .",

    "however the hamiltonian formalism itsself does not require that variables are fundamental and therefore this formalism can be applied to any system with dynamical constants .",
