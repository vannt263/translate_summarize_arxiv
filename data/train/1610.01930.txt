    "the present work was motivated by the goal of proving an analog of the higher order directional derivative chain rule of huang , marcantognini , and young for the abelian functor calculus of johnson and mccarthy . achieving this goal required first dealing with the question of how to define a higher order directional derivative in this context . to get a sense of the choices involved , consider the functor @xmath27 .",

    "although our original motivation for this project was to prove higher order chain rules , we found that a significant part of the challenge in doing so involved placing these chain rules and the abelian functor calculus itself in an appropriate categorical context .",

    "the use of terms such as  calculus \" and  derivatives \" has been justified by pointing out strong formal resemblances to the classical constructions from analysis and undergraduate calculus .",
    "although these analogies are compelling , one wonders if there is a deeper justification .",
    "in the course of investigating the higher order chain rule for directional derivatives , we discovered that the properties of the directional derivative for abelian functor calculus correspond exactly to the axioms defining the cartesian differential categories of blute , cockett , and seely @xcite . this concept captures the notion of differentiation in a wide variety of contexts ( the category of real vector spaces and smooth maps equipped with the usual differential operator is a standard example of a cartesian differential category ) and provides an explanation for some of the formal resemblances .",
    "we prove    the homotopy category @xmath69 is a cartesian differential category .    in this statement , @xmath70 is the homotopy category of @xmath68 obtained by inverting pointwise chain homotopy equivalences .",
    "the directional derivative @xmath71 gives this category its cartesian differential category structure .",
    "fitting calculus into this context led to additional insight stemming from the fact that a cartesian differential category is also an example of a tangent category , as defined by cockett and cruttwell @xcite .",
    "tangent categories are characterized by the existence of an endofunctor @xmath72 satisfying essential properties of tangent bundles for manifolds .",
    "our first proof of the chain rule of theorem [ t : higherchainrule ] did not make use of the tangent category structure on @xmath70 , but the proof presented here , which does use the endofunctor @xmath72 , provides a conceptual simplification . as the first - order chain rule can be seen to encode the functoriality of the derivative , the @xmath0th order chain rule can be extracted from the functoriality of the iterated endofunctor @xmath73 , which is an easily derived consequence of our corollary [ cor : cdc ] .    proving that @xmath70 is a cartesian differential category required reworking many of the constructions and results for abelian functor calculus established in @xcite . driving these challenges",
    "was the fact that chain rules in the abelian context do not come in the form of isomorphisms .",
    "for example , applying the definition of @xmath71 ( see definition [ defn : dir - derivative ] or [ defn : dir - derivative - jm ] ) to @xmath1 produces a chain complex that is not isomorphic to @xmath74 in general . instead",
    ", when @xmath3 is reduced ( @xmath75 ) , @xcite prove that there is a quasi - isomorphism between @xmath76 and @xmath74 .",
    "the axioms of a cartesian differential category require that @xmath77 and @xmath74 be isomorphic .",
    "this suggests that we attempt to realize @xmath68 as a cartesian differential category by inverting quasi - isomorphisms .",
    "but because the functors we consider between abelian categories are far from being exact , when we invert quasi - isomorphisms in @xmath68 , the composition of morphisms is no longer well - defined .",
    "however , the somewhat delicately defined composition in our kleisli category preserves chain homotopy equivalences , so we define @xmath70 to be the category that inverts these instead . because of this we needed to upgrade many definitions and results of @xcite from quasi - isomorphisms to chain homotopy equivalences .    revising results of @xcite to work up to chain homotopy equivalence rather than quasi - isomorphism was a relatively straightforward process , with the notable exception of the chain rule itself . that required proving the following proposition , which refines lemma 5.7 of @xcite .",
    "for any composable pair of functors @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath3 reduced , there is a chain homotopy equivalence @xmath80    to prove this , we prove a technical general result that might be of independent interest ( or might already be in the literature ) :    let @xmath81 be a first - quadrant bicomplex so that every row except the zeroth row @xmath82 is contractible",
    ". then the natural inclusion @xmath83 is a chain homotopy equivalence .",
    "we include a proof of this lemma in appendix a. the proof defines an explicit chain homotopy on the total complex that does not come from a chain homotopy of bicomplexes , as defined in @xcite .",

    "we define and review properties of the cross effect functors .",
    "these are the building blocks for the taylor towers of abelian functor calculus , including the linearization and directional derivative functors .",
    "section 3 is used to define the kleisli and homotopy categories in which the constructions and main results of the paper take place . in section 4 ,",
    "we show how the taylor towers of abelian functor calculus are built and establish their fundamental properties .",
    "this treatment differs from that of @xcite in two important ways . as discussed in section [ s : context ] , we need the fundamental properties of the tower to hold up to chain homotopy equivalence instead of quasi - isomorphism . in addition , we have streamlined the means by which terms in the abelian functor calculus tower are defined .",
    "we do so by identifying a comonad @xmath85 on the category of all functors between a fixed pair of abelian categories , and defining @xmath20 directly as a resolution of @xmath2 by this comonad . in @xcite ,",
    "this approach was only used for the category of reduced functors . an extra step involving a mapping cone",
    "was used to extend this construction to all functors .    in section 5 ,",
    "we start working out the main ingredients for our chain rules  we define the linearization functor @xmath86 and derive its essential properties .",
    "we use these to define the directional derivative for abelian functor calculus in section 6 , and prove that it gives @xmath70 the structure of a cartesian differential category . in section 7 , we define the iterated partial directional derivatives and the higher order directional derivatives and prove that they are related by the fa di bruno formula of theorem [ thm : restatedgoal ] .",
    "we prove the analog of the higher order chain rule of @xcite in section 8 , using the tangent category structure of @xmath70 .",
    "finally , in section 9 , we discuss how the directional derivatives are related to a notion of ordinary derivatives for abelian functor calculus and use the main result of section 7 to prove the fa di bruno - style formula for these derivatives in corollary [ cor : faachainrule ] .",
    "this paper introduces a number of constructions on functors ( e.g. , the higher order directional derivatives ) and investigates their behavior with respect to composition , product constructions , and so forth .",
