    "current cosmological observations , especially measurements of the spectrum of temperature anisotropies and polarisation of the cosmic microwave background , provide strong evidence for the existence of primordial density perturbations on large scales , far larger than the hubble scale at the time of last - scattering .",
    "observations are consistent with an almost scale - invariant , gaussian distribution of adiabatic primordial perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the standard explanation for the origin of the primordial perturbations is that the universe underwent an accelerated , inflationary , expansion in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "zero - point vacuum fluctuations in a massless scalar field naturally give rise to a scale - invariant distribution of effectively classical field fluctuations on super - hubble scales during an exponential ( de sitter ) expansion .",
    "if inflation is driven by a light , slowly - rolling , inflaton field then these field fluctuations can be directly related to a comoving curvature perturbation , @xmath1 , which remains constant for adiabatic perturbations on super - hubble scales until a given wavelength re - enters the horizon in the subsequent radiation- or matter - dominated eras .",
    "it is important to consider whether or not inflation is the _ only _ consistent model for the origin of large - scale structure in our universe .",
    "an alternative proposal is that the hot big bang and the primordial perturbations originate not from an accelerated expansion , but from a preceding collapse . in classical general relativity",
    "a collapsing universe may be doomed to a singularity , but in a finite quantum theory of gravity , such as string theory , the spectrum of states going into the `` singularity '' would be expected to determine some out - going state .",
    "in particular the collapse phase could set the initial conditions for a subsequent post - big bang phase .",
    "gasperini and veneziano originally proposed @xcite a pre big bang scenario based on the superstring low energy effective action @xcite .",
    "more recently khoury et al proposed the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite motivated by colliding brane solutions in heterotic m - theory ( see also @xcite for later developments of this scenario ) .",
    "both models invoke a collapsing universe in the 4d einstein frame where the energy density is dominated by minimally coupled scalar fields .    in a collapsing universe",
    "zero - point vacuum fluctuations with a given wavelength are squeezed outside the rapidly shrinking hubble scale , also naturally giving rise to a spectrum of field fluctuations on super - hubble scales .",
    "however in either pre big bang or ekpyrotic scenarios , vacuum fluctuations give rise to a steeply blue - tilted spectrum of comoving curvature perturbations during the collapse @xcite .",
    "if the tilt of the comoving curvature spectrum remains unchanged during the transition from pre to post big bang phase then this can not seed the observed large scale structure in our universe .",
    "one would then have to consider alternative sources for structure after a collapse phase , such as the curvaton mechanism @xcite , or consider a different collapse model .",
    "collapse driven by matter or a scalar field with pressureless equation of state can produce a scale - invariant spectrum of comoving curvature perturbations  @xcite .",
    "although very general physical arguments have been advanced that the comoving curvature perturbation , @xmath1 , should be conserved on super - horizon scales for adiabatic density perturbations @xcite there are several possible ambiguities that may arise in the transition from collapse to bounce , not present in conventional models of an inflationary expansion . at any bounce",
    "the comoving hubble scale diverges and all scales are inside the hubble scale , at least for an instant  @xcite . and the bardeen metric potential , @xmath2 , does not have the same spectral dependence as the comoving curvature perturbation during the collapse @xcite , even though the two tilts must coincide for adiabatic perturbations in the subsequent expanding universe . as a result it is impossible for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 to obey non - singular evolution equations through the bounce @xcite .",
    "in fact the bardeen potential on super - hubble scales grows rapidly in a collapsing phase .",
    "this was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite who realised that the divergence of perturbations in the bardeen s longitudinal ( or conformal newtonian ) gauge could be eliminated by a gauge - transformation to the spatially flat ( or off - diagonal ) gauge .",
    "however we will see that at the moment of bounce the spatially flat gauge itself becomes ill - defined .",
    "the comoving curvature perturbation may remain small during collapse but it too becomes ill - defined in the vicinity of the bounce in our model .",
    "the breakdown of perturbation theory in any given gauge does not necessarily signal the breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "it is well known that the comoving curvature perturbation becomes singular at stationary values of the field even in single - field inflation models , but there are other gauge choices where perturbations remain small  @xcite .",
    "several authors have studied the evolution of perturbations through a bounce using some analytic form for the background scale factor @xcite and/or the evolution equations for perturbations @xcite . but this has lead to apparently contradictory results depending on which functions are assumed to have a smooth regular form @xcite .    in order to investigate some of these issues associated with the evolution of cosmological perturbations through the bounce we will consider a simple scalar field model for a non - singular bounce .",
    "we are following the general approach envisaged in the pre big bang scenario @xcite where higher - order corrections to the effective action will become significant at high curvatures or strong coupling and can yield non - singular bounce solutions @xcite . in the ekpyrotic or cyclic models",
    "the transition is supposed to occur at a real singularity in the effective-4d theory .",
    "not only background quantities but also perturbations diverge here .",
    "so our 4d analysis will not address arguments about the regularisation schemes at the singularity proposed so far @xcite .",
    "there have already been a few numerical studies of the evolution of perturbations through non - singular bounce solutions including higher - order corrections to the string effective action @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that that the null energy condition must be violated for a bounce to occur in general relativity in a spatially flat 4d frw cosmology @xcite .",
    "( this is quite different from non - singular classical bounces which have been studied in closed frw models @xcite which do not violate the null energy condition , but require fine - tuned initial conditions to obtain a sufficiently long collapse phase @xcite . )",
    "one problem with results based on higher - order corrections near the bounce is that the evolution close to the bounce becomes dominated by the `` corrections '' and one can not be sure that even higher - order corrections would not also become important @xcite .",
    "another complication is that increasingly higher - order corrections are equivalent to introducing additional fields with non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite so that the true dynamical degrees of freedom become obscured .    in order to make the physical degrees of freedom manifest we will work with scalar fields obeying canonical wave equations in four - dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "the price we must pay for such simplicity , while still obtaining a non - singular bounce , is that one of the scalar fields will be a massless `` ghost '' field with negative kinetic energy , in order to violate the null energy condition near the bounce .",
    "such a ghost field would lead to the presence of serious instabilities in any low energy theory @xcite .",
    "however it does not play any significant role in our model at early or late times .",
    "instead it leads to precisely the sort of instability at high energies that we require to achieve a bounce in the high - energy regime , destabilising the pre big bang collapse phase and triggering the transition to an expanding cosmology .",
    "our scalar field model is intended only as a simple model of a non - singular bounce and not as a realistic model of the low energy universe .",
    "the early- and late - time ( low energy ) evolution in our model is dominated by a conventional minimally - coupled scalar field with exponential potential . by choosing the dimensionless slope of the potential we are able to investigate different power - law solutions for the pre big bang collapse leading to different power spectra for the field and metric perturbations @xcite .",
    "a very similar bounce model was studied by peter and pinto - neto @xcite , but we find very different results .    in the original pre",
    "big bang scenario higher - order corrections to the effective action will become significant at high curvatures or strong coupling and can yield non - singular bounce solutions @xcite , at least for some initial conditions and some higher - order corrections . in particular it can be shown that the null energy condition must be violated for a bounce to occur in a 4d frw cosmology @xcite .",
    "we first study the background evolution of our model using a phase - plane analysis in section [ background ] . with a particular choice of dimensionless phase variables the early or late time solutions correspond to critical points in the phase plane .",
    "however an alternative choice of variables is better suited to study evolution through the bounce .",
    "we identify a class of non - singular models which start in a power - law collapse in the asymptotic past , pass smoothly through a bounce and approach a power - law expansion .",
    "we then define linear perturbations about this background model in section [ perturb ] .",
    "we present the evolution and constraint equations for the perturbations in arbitrary gauge and then identify particular gauge choices that are well - suited to study the perturbations at early and late times , or through the bounce , analogously to the different choice of background variables used to study the background phase - plane in different regimes .",
    "the choice of gauge to take the perturbations through the bounce is vital as it must be ensured that the gauge itself is well defined throughout the bounce , and we identify problems with gauges commonly used in inflationary models .    in section [ evolve ]",
    "we evolve first - order evolution equations for the metric and field perturbations and use the constraint equations as a consistency check of our calculation .",
    "we assume perturbations begin in the quantum vacuum state on small scales and use this to calculate the spectrum of perturbations generated on super - hubble scales during collapse .",
    "we evolve this numerically through the bounce in order to calculate the resulting spectrum of curvature perturbations .",
    "we present our results in section [ results ] in terms of the gauge - invariant variables @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we find that it is possible to produce a scale - invariant spectrum of adiabatic perturbations on super - hubble scales from a collapse phase in our simple model .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "we consider a spatially flat frw cosmology containing two minimally scalar fields ; one with positive kinetic energy and self - interaction potential and one with negative kinetic energy and zero potential energy .",
    "the lagrangian of the system is = - ^ , _ , - v ( ) + ^ , _ , . with our choice of signature",
    "the field @xmath4 has a positive definite energy density and @xmath5 is a `` ghost '' field with negative energy density .",

    "the total four - velocity of the two - field system is momentarily ill - defined .",

    "according to the definition of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ defphi ] ) this yields a large curvature perturbation in the longitudinal gauge .",
    "our numerical evolution for @xmath11 and @xmath28 during the power - law collapse phase confirms this , yielding @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively .",
    "thus the curvature perturbation in the longitudinal gauge becomes large in a collapse phase meaning that this gauge too may not be reliable gauge for performing a perturbative calculation through a cosmological bounce .",
    "once again though we emphasise that our calculations of the bardeen potential are reliable as we reconstruct the bardeen potential from perturbative calculations in the uniform-@xmath5 gauge which remain small through the bounce .",
    "after the bounce the dominant modes contributing to the bardeen potential , @xmath108 and @xmath110 , remain dominated by the shear , @xmath136 , which now decays in the expanding phase . eventually the bardeen potential settles down to a constant value on super - hubble scales , before finally oscillating after re - entering the hubble scale . for @xmath28 the sub - dominant modes , @xmath107 and @xmath109 , have much smaller shear ( indeed @xmath2 stays small for these modes right up until the bounce ) and these modes rapidly settle down to a constant value soon after the bounce , but this final amplitude is smaller than that due to the dominant @xmath108 and @xmath110 modes .    in summary we find that the amplitudes of the bardeen potential during collapse are not a good predictor of the amplitude of the eventual adiabatic curvature perturbation on large scales after the bounce , even though it becomes much larger than the comoving curvature perturbation during the collapse .",

    "we assume that these perturbations begin in the flat - spacetime vacuum state at early times and use this to predict the amplitude of large scale ( super - hubble ) adiabatic density perturbations after the bounce .",
    "although both the bardeen potential @xmath2 and comoving curvature perturbation @xmath3 evolve smoothly at the instantaneous bounce , they both have potential problems .",
    "the bardeen potential grows rapidly during the collapse phase and is much greater than unity for the modes of interest , calling into question the validity of linear perturbation theory in the longitudinal gauge  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the comoving gauge becomes singular whenever the total kinetic energy of the scalar fields vanishes  @xcite , which occurs shortly before and after the bounce in our model .",
    "we can however find a gauge in which the metric perturbations remain small and linear perturbation theory should be valid . in our model",
    "the massless ghost field is monotonic and provides a suitable time variable , defining a well - defined choice of gauge ( the uniform @xmath5-field gauge ) for perturbations .",
    "we note that we solve the regularized unconstrained evolution equations for the perturbations , using the constraint equations as a check of our numerical integration .",
    "this avoids potential problems that could arise from using the constraint equations to eliminate variables whose coefficients vanish at the bounce  @xcite .",
    "we can then reconstruct the usual gauge - invariant variables from calculations in this gauge .",
    "we find that the comoving curvature perturbation calculated during the collapse phase is a good estimator of the resulting adiabatic density perturbation on super - hubble scales in the expanding phase .",
    "note that the value at the end of the collapse phase is not in general the same as the that at hubble - crossing during collapse ( unlike the usual case in an inflationary expansion ) .",
    "this is because the dominant mode during collapse is a non - adiabatic field perturbation .",
    "however the comoving curvature perturbation remains constant on super - hubble scales after the bounce .",
    "by contrast the bardeen potential calculated in the collapse phase is not a good indicator of the subsequent large scale adiabatic perturbation in the expanding phase .",
    "it is dominated by the shear in the uniform @xmath5-field gauge , which grows rapidly in the collapse phase and then decays away after the bounce , until the bardeen potential settles down to a constant value on super - hubble scales , related to the comoving curvature perturbation by the usual expression @xmath158 .",
    "this basic point has been made by many authors @xcite and here we demonstrate it explicitly for our simple bounce model .",
    "in particular we find that the spectral tilt of the final adiabatic curvature perturbation on super - hubble scales in the expanding phase is given by the spectral tilt of the initial comoving curvature perturbations ( or equivalently the scalar field fluctuations in the spatially flat gauge ) .",
    "we therefore have given an explicit model for a power - law collapse with @xmath28 which yields a scale - invariant of adiabatic perturbations on super - hubble scales in the expanding phase .",
    "the amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation on the smallest scale ( that is the minimum value of the hubble scale during collapse ) is set by the energy scale relative to the planck scale ( where vacuum fluctuations in the metric become of order unity ) _ r ( k = ah_max ) ~ ( ) ^2 .",
    "this is very similar to the amplitude of gravitational waves ( tensor perturbations ) produced during collapse .",
    "the tensor - scalar ratio is an important constraint on conventional inflation models and turns out to be a severe constraint on our collapse model when @xmath28 .",
    "pre big bang or collapse models have been criticised for the degree of fine - tuning required to set up the initial conditions at the start of any collapse phase  @xcite . the dimensionless parameter @xmath44 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ defc ] ) , is a first integral of the equations of motion which selects the trajectory in the homogeneous phase - space .",
    "although any value for @xmath159 yields a non - singular bounce for models with @xmath28 , only trajectories with @xmath146 give an acceptably small tensor - scalar ratio .",
    "this provides a quantitative measure of the degree of fine - tuning of initial conditions required to get an acceptable primordial density perturbation within the class of models considered in this paper .",
