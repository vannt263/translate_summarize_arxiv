    "the standard weak friction theory for tidal interaction in binary stars , first introduced by darwin ( 1879 ) , and developed in detail by many authors ( e.g. , alexander 1973 ; kopal 1978 ; hut 1981 ) , is based on the assumption of static tide in hydrostatic equilibrium . in the presence of finite dissipation",
    ", a tidal lag develops between the tidal bulge and the external tidal potential , and the resulting tidal torque drives the spin and orbital evolution .",
    "this theory has been applied successfully to planet - satellite systems ( e.g. , goldreich & peale 1968 ) , and can also be used to describe binaries of low - mass ( late - type ) stars if appropriate turbulent viscosity due to convective eddies is used ( zahn 1977 ; goodman & oh 1997 ) .",
    "the static tide approximation , however , is not appropriate for many other binary processes , especially those involving massive ( early - type ) stars with radiative envelopes , where dynamical excitation and radiative damping of low - frequency g - modes dominate the tidal interaction ( zahn 1977 ; goldreich & nicholson 1989 ) . in these early works , the effect of rotation on the dynamical tide",
    "is neglected or introduced phenomenogically ( but see nicholson 1979 and rocca 1989 , where some aspects of rotational effects are explored ) , and only circular ( or near circular ) binary orbits are considered .    in this paper",
    "we study dynamical tides in rotating , eccentric binary stars .",
    "our work is motivated by the recent observations of the psr j0045 - 7319/b - star binary ( kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ) , which contains a radio pulsar and a massive rapidly - rotating b - star in an eccentric @xmath3 days orbit , with periastron separation of only @xmath4 stellar radii .",
    "this system therefore constitutes an excellent laboratory for studying dynamical tidal interaction . in a preliminary analysis ( lai 1996 ) of the rapid orbital decay of the binary",
    "as revealed by timing observation ( kaspi et al .  1996 ) , it was realized that rotation can have rather significant effect on the strength of dynamical tides . in particular ,",
    "when the b - star has a retrograde rotation ( with magnitude of one half of the maximum value , for example ) with respect to the orbital motion , the dynamical tidal energy is increased over the nonrotating value by two orders of magnitude . roughly speaking ,",
    "this comes about because retrograde rotation shifts the tidal resonance ( where the mode frequency equals the external driving frequency ) from high - order g - modes to lower - order ones , which couple much more strongly to the tidal potential .",
    "it is this enhancement of dynamical tide by retrograde rotation that allows the binary orbit to decay on a short time scale of @xmath5 myr , although it has been suggested ( correctly in our opinion ) by kumar and quataert ( 1997 ; hereafter kq ) that differential rotation is also required in order to keep the mode damping time relatively short ( see  6 for more discussion ) . in this paper",
    "we present a full analysis of dynamical tides in rotating stars , with applications to the orbital evolution of the psr j0045 - 7319/b - star binary .",
    "we shall focus on the dynamical aspects of the problem , i.e. , those aspects that are independent of dissipation mechanisms .",
    "we particularly emphasize the difficulty with the usual mode decomposition because of the asymmetry between modes with opposite signs of pattern speed .",
    "such difficulty has led to quantitatively misleading results concerning the tidal energy in stars with rapid prograde rotation ( kq ; see  6.3 for discussion ) .",
    "another prominent example in which dynamical tides play an important role is binary formation from tidal capture .",
    "this process was originally suggested by fabian , pringle & rees ( 1975 ) to explain the origin of low - mass x - ray binaries in globular clusters : during a close passage of two stars in an unbound orbit , the excess orbital energy is transferred through dynamical tidal excitation to the internal stellar oscillations , resulting in a bound system .",
    "although it has been recognized in recent years that primordial binaries play an important role in the dynamics of globular clusters , and may also be involved ( via exchange interaction with another star ) to produce low - mass x - ray binaries and other stellar exotica ( e.g. , hut et al .",
    "1992 ; davies 1996 ) , tidal capture can still be an efficient means to produce tight binaries , thereby providing an energy source to reverse core collapse .",
    "many theoretical issues related to tidal capture process have been studied , including linear and nonlinear energy transfer ( press and teukolsky 1977 , hereafter pt ; lee & ostriker 1986 ; khokhlov , novikov & pethick 1993 ) , evolution of the binary subsequent to capture ( kochanek 1992 ; novikov , pethick & polnarev 1992 ; mardling 1995 ) and dissipation of tidally excited modes ( kumar & goodman 1996 ) .",
    "however , the possible role of stellar rotation on the tidal energy and angular momentum transfer has not been considered .",
    "indeed , we find in this paper that rotation changes the cross - section for tidal capture , and can significantly increase the probability of forming binaries through tidal interaction .    our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the basic equations describing the tidal excitations of normal modes in a rotating star and the orbital response to the excited oscillations .",
    "we then derive in  3 general expressions for energy transfer and angular momentum transfer in a periastron passage when there is no initial oscillation .",
    "for an eccentric system , this energy transfer is directly proportional to the steady - state mode energy in the presence of dissipation , and provide a measure of the strength of the dynamical tide ( see  6.1 ) . in ",
    "4 we examine the properties of rotating modes that are relevant for tidal excitation ; these are used in specific calculations presented in   5 - 6 .",
    "we apply our general formalism to the tidal capture problem in  5 and the orbital evolution of psr j0045 - 7319/b - star binary in  6 . a brief discussion of related problems is given in  7 .",
    "consider a rotating star with mass @xmath6 , radius @xmath7 and spin @xmath8 , interacting with a companion @xmath9 .",
    "we treat @xmath9 as a point mass , although generalization to the case where both stars have finite structure is straightforward . for simplicity here we assume the spin axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane ( but @xmath10 can have both positive and negative signs , corresponding to prograde and retrograde rotations with respect to the orbit ) .",
    "generalized equations for arbitrary spin - orbit inclination angles are summarized in appendix a.    in the linear regime , the perturbation of the tidal potential on @xmath6 is specified by the lagrangian displacement @xmath11 of a fluid element from its unperturbed position . in the inertial frame ,",

    "we clearly see that for @xmath192 ( retrograde rotation ) , the energy and angular momentum transfers can be significantly increased over the nonrotating values .",
    "this comes about for the following reasons : during a perastron passage , the most strongly excited modes are those ( i ) propagating in the same direction as the orbital motion of the companion ( corresponding to the @xmath190 modes in our notation ) , ( ii ) having frequencies in the inertial frame comparable to the `` driving frequency '' , which is equal to twice of orbital frequency at periastron , i.e. , @xmath218 ( the `` resonant condition '' ) , and ( iii ) having relatively large @xmath219 . since higher - order ( lower frequency ) g - modes have smaller couping coefficients than the low - order ones , the trade - off between ( ii ) and ( iii ) implies that the modes that absorb most tidal energy are those with frequencies higher than the resonant mode .",
    "for example ,",
    "when @xmath220 and @xmath166 , the resonant mode is @xmath221 , with frequency @xmath222 , while the dominant modes in energy transfer are g@xmath223-g@xmath224 ( which have @xmath225 ) .",
    "a retrograde rotation `` drags '' such @xmath190 waves backward , so that the mode frequencies in the inertial frame are lowered . as a result ,",

    "the energy transfer is greatly increased .",
    "for example , at @xmath227 and @xmath220 , the dominant modes are g@xmath228-g@xmath229 , the net energy transfer ( in the inertial frame ) @xmath0 is about @xmath230 times larger than the nonrotating value .",
    "while relatively small prograde rotation ( @xmath231 ) decreases the energy transfer , we see from fig .  4 that for sufficiently large @xmath10 ( or more precisely for sufficiently large ratio of @xmath232 ) , @xmath1 or even @xmath0 can become negative , i.e.",
    ", angular momentum and energy are transferred from the star to the orbit ( see also fig .  8 in  6 ) .",
    "this behavior can be understood as follows : the angular momentum of a mode is related to its energy in the rotating frame by @xmath233 , thus the prograde mode ( @xmath190 ) carries positive angular momentum , while the retrograde mode carries negative angular momentum ( note that @xmath234 is always positive ) . for a fixed @xmath215 , prograde rotation increases the frequencies of the prograde modes , shifts the resonance to higher radial orders ( which have smaller @xmath219 ) , therefore decreases the positive angular momentum transfer to the star . on the other hand ,",
    "the retrograde modes are `` dragged '' forward by the rotation , and their @xmath235 s become smaller and may even become negative ( i.e. , they are prograde in the inertial frame ) . therefore their contributions to the energy transfer become increasingly more important and the negative angular momentum transfer to the star increases as @xmath10 increases .",
    "when the negative angular momentum transferred to the @xmath236 modes becomes larger than the positive angular momentum transferred to the @xmath190 modes , the net @xmath1 changes sign , and at the same time , @xmath115 begins to increase with increasing @xmath10 ( for a given @xmath215 ) . at even larger @xmath10 ,",
