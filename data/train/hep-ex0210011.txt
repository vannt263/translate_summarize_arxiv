    "the btev  @xcite experiment is being readied to study beauty and charm physics at the fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "the goals are to make an exhaustive search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and make precise measurements of the sm parameters . the important measurements to make involve cp violation , mixing , and rare decays of hadrons containing b or c quarks .",
    "since detection of photons , mostly from @xmath0 or @xmath1 decays is essential to accomplish our physics objectives , we have decided to use an electromagneticcalorimeter ( emcal ) made of lead tungstate pbwo@xmath2 ( pwo ) crystals .",
    "these crystals produce light proportional to the incident electromagnetic energy ; this light will be sensed by photomultiplier tubes .",
    "this system is ideal for a heavy quark experiment at a hadron collider because of excellent energy and position resolution , a compact shower size that minimizes overlapping showers ( due to the small moliere radius ) , fast signals that minimize shower overlaps in time and expected excellent radiation hardness .",
    "pioneering work on pwo crystals performance was done at protvino  @xcite .",
    "these results showed the promise of such crystals .",
    "however , the technology of mass producing such crystals with high purity was not yet known .",
    "the cms group worked with companies both in russia and china to perfect these techniques  @xcite .    in high luminosity collider experiments ,",
    "pwo crystals will be irradiated by high energy particles and accumulate significant absorbed doses , up to a few mrad .",
    "the radiation hardness of pwo crystals has been studied by the cms group using radioactive sources and electron beams  @xcite .",
    "the general conclusion is that lead tungstate crystals were radiation hard , and that the damage in crystals depends only on the dose rate  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , important to measure radiation damages of pwo crystals in high energy particle environments which are more similar to that which these crystals will be exposed to .",
    "it is important to emphasize @xcite that in a hadron collider experiment radiation effects from hadronic interactions and neutrons could be much more serious than seen with photons or electrons of the same doses .",
    "compared to photons or electrons , high - energy hadrons will be able to induce inelastic nuclear reactions which will locally destroy the crystal lattice .",
    "in particular , they can create nuclear fragments with very high energy transfer and lead to extended clusters of crystal lattice distortion .",
    "a simple calculation suggests that such interaction may produce significant number of additional crystal defects over the life of btev .",
    "therefore it is crucial to study the radiation hardness of pwo - crystals using a hadron environment which is similar to the btev emcal expectations .",
    "such radiation studies with lead tungstate crystals have been carried out for the first time .",
    "the results of this study are presented in this paper .",
    "the general goal of our test beam studies was to evaluate the performance of lead tungstate crystals produced by two manufacturers in russia , bogoroditsk and northern crystal in apatity , and one in china , shanghai institute of ceramics .",
    "more specific goals were to understand how to set specifications for purchasing crystals , confirm energy and position resolution predictions , measure the radiation rate dependence of light output , and measure the correlation between light output and the led calibration system at varying radiation loads .",
    "the 2b beam channel at the protvino accelerator u70 has been specifically developed to provide these measurements  @xcite .",
    "results on energy and position resolutions of the pwo crystals which were obtained in these runs have been published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "a general picture of radiation damage of pwo crystals as well as the results of simulations on dose rate profiles in the pwo crystals with the use of the mars program  @xcite are described in sec .",
    "these calculations are made for the btev experiment and for the two types of radiation studies of pwo crystals which have been carried out in protvino for btev . in these studies we irradiated crystals with ( a ) moderate dose rates ( 1 - 60 rad / h ) of high - intensity high - energy electron and pion beams in the secondary particle channel 2b and ( b ) super - intensive dose rates of mixed beam at a dedicated facility that was several meters away from the main ring of the u70 .",
    "the test beam facility for approach ( a ) , including phototube monitoring as well as the results of the moderate dose rates irradiation are discussed in sec .",
    "three accelerator runs , each up to a month long were devoted to these studies .",
    "the results from approach ( b ) are given in sec .",
    "the conclusions of the entire radiation studies are presented in sec . v.",
    "radiation hardness studies of detectors and electronics are an important concern in emcal design  @xcite all crystal scintillators suffer from radiation damage .",
    "the most common radiation damage is due to color center formation , which results from trapping of electrons in crystal defects such as vacancies , displacements and impurities  @xcite .",
    "these electrons are often in metastable states and can be excited by visible photons to higher energies .",
    "color centers reduce light transparency of crystals , resulting in reduced light output .",
    "additional damage may be caused by hadrons when they create crystal defects by displacing nuclei or changing nuclei to different nuclei .",
    "this kind of damage can not only reduce light transparency , but , in principle , also reduce primary scintillation light itself .",
    "it would be more difficult to monitor the latter effect .",
    "since the trapped electrons are in metastable states of varying lifetimes and `` potential barriers '' , some of them may disappear very quickly , whereas others may be almost permanent .    when a pwo crystal no longer receives radiation , its color centers ( semi - stable excited states ) disappear , and it recovers from transmission degradation by natural room - temperature annealing .",
    "in fact , this annealing goes on even during radiation exposure . in general the rate of radiation damage decreases with the amount of damage .",
    "therefore , when crystals are exposed to a constant radiation level , they lose light only up to the point when the rates of radiation damage and natural recovery balance",
    ". raised temperatures accelerate the recovery process and so may ultra violet irradiation . because the damage may recover at room temperature , it leads to a dose rate dependence of the light output .",
    "+ the cms experimental data , mainly from photon and electron irradiation , indicate that the light transmission of crystals deteriorates due to formation of color centers by radiation , while the scintillation mechanism itself seems unaffected .",
    "besides dependence on the dose rate , the radiation damage of pwo crystals could also be sensitive to the type of radiation .",
    "in particular , the properties of crystals could be significantly degraded in hadron beams by displacement damage effects , i.e. distortions of the crystal structure . in these studies",
    "it is very useful to know the hadron fluence , the hadron spectra and the absorbed dose rate .",
    "+ the btev emcal extends radially outward from the beam line .",
    "the crystals near the beam pipe receive the maximum dose . in order to ascertain the level of radiation in the crystals we performed calculations using the mars code .",
    "results are given in table  [ tab : summary ] .",
    "+    .fraction of btev crystals with given absorbed doses and dose rates estimated at the maximum of the dose profiles inside the crystals ( 100 rad = 1 gy ) [ cols=\"^ , < , < \" , ]     the results of the irradiation of the two crystals in the first exposure are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bogoroditsk ] .",
    "the procedure was to irradiate the crystals and then measure their light output immediately thereafter using the 27 gev electron beam . in some cases",
    ", we measured the light output again after letting the crystals sit without any radiation .",
    "the bogoroditsk crystal ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bogoroditsk](a ) ) lost @xmath3 of the initial signal after first 3.4  krad dose .",
    "after the second irradiation , the absorbed dose increased up to 43  krad and the signal loss was increased up to @xmath4 . after 47 hours of recovery time , the signal rose up to @xmath5 .",
    "after the third irradiation , the bogoroditsk crystal accumulated 313  krad and the signal was at the level of 49@xmath6 .",
    "32 hours of recovery time returned it to a level of 57@xmath6 .",
    "after the fourth dose the total radiation was 2300  krad and the signal level was at 37@xmath6 .",
    "after 15 hours recovery time , the signal recovered slightly to 39@xmath6 .",
    "+ the shanghai crystal ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bogoroditsk](b ) ) lost @xmath7 of the signal after first 1.8  krad dose .",
    "after the second irradiation , the integrated dose increased up to 23  krad and the signal loss increased up to @xmath3 relative to the signal before the irradiation . after 47 hours of recovery time , the signal rised up to @xmath8 .",
    "after the third irradiation , the shanghai crystal accumulated 163  krad and the signal was at the level of 66@xmath6 .",
    "one should mention that the signal was pretty stable between the second and the third irradiations including recovery time and was at the level 66 - 69@xmath6 for the absorbed doses of 23 - 163  krad .",
    "after getting 2800  krad , the signal dropped down to 33@xmath6 .",
    "+    one of the most important conclusions of this work is that even after an integrated dose about 2.5  mrad obtained with a super - intensive dose rate 100  krad / h both crystals remained usable , although they lost 2/3 of their light . in btev",
    "we expect that only @xmath9 of the crystals will receive this much dose in a year .",
    "as was expected , the constants of proportionality in the mip - electron correlations for both the crystals are about 1 .",
    "the led - electron correlations for both the crystals are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_led_rus ] .",
    "the constants of proportionality for the two crystals are 0.5 and 0.66 .",
    "the degradation of single crystal energy resolution for 27 gev electrons was only @xmath10 for bogoroditsk crystal and @xmath11 for the shanghai crystal .",
    "+ the four crystals irradiated in the second exposure with a dose rate of 0.5 - 1 krad / h , and a total dose of 350 - 700 rad , lost up to 10@xmath6 of their light output for shanghai crystals and up to 25@xmath6 for bogoroditsk crystals . after each of the next three runs no signal loss was seen , within the 3@xmath6 accuracy ( the systematic error due to a pmt gain change effect ) .",
    "radiation hardness of lead tungstate crystals is an important issue for the btev experiment at fermilab .",
    "simulation of absorbed dose profiles in the crystals with the use of the mars program has shown that the dose rates for the crystals range from 0.1 up to 700 rad / h .",
    "about 95@xmath6 of the crystals in the btev electromagnetic calorimeter will get the absorbed doses from 0.1 to 30 rad / h assuming that the tevatron luminosity is @xmath12 .",
    "almost 5@xmath6 of the crystals will get from 30 rad / h up to 200 rad / h , and only 0.5@xmath6 more than 200 rad / h . + a study of radiation damage in lead tungstate crystals has been carried out in protvino in 2001 - 2002 for btev .",
    "the crystals were manufactured in bogoroditsk ( russia ) and shanghai ( china ) at the very end of 2000 , and in apatity ( russia ) in early 2002 .",
    "there were two approaches in the study .",
    "first , crystals were irradiated by high - intensity high - energy electron and hadron beams at radiation doses ranging from 0.1 to 60 rad / h .",
    "secondly , crystals were irradiated by charged hadrons , @xmath13-quanta and neutrons from the internal target of the u70 in a wide energy spectrum from 10 ev up to 70 gev at dose rates between 0.5 and 100 krad / h .",
    "+ the dependence of light output loss on a dose rate has been measured .",
    "the light loss exhibited saturation when the dose rate was kept constant . at larger dose rates ,",
    "the light output loss still saturates but at lower light output levels .",
    "each crystal had a different percentage of light loss when it saturated .",
    "more quantitatively : no light output loss was observed for dose rates less than 1 rad / h . for dose rates of 10 - 25 rad",
    "/ h with 27-gev electron irradiation , eight crystals lost on the average 8@xmath6 . for 40 gev pions",
    "this average was 12@xmath6 at comparable irradiation dose rates .",
    "the difference between the damage due to electron and pion irradiation can be attributed entirely to their difference in the radiation profile along the length of the crystal .",
    "much of electron energy is deposited near the shower maximum , from 4 to 10 cm from the front of the crystal . for pion beams , the radiation dose profile reaches its maximum around 5 - 7 cm and",
    "stretches all the way to the rear - end of the crystal .",
    "however , a possible effect due to the difference between the physical processes by which electrons and pions interact with crystals can not be ruled out .",
    "+ for dose rates of 30 - 60 rad / h using 40-gev pion irradiation , five crystals lost on the average 20@xmath6 . for a dose rate of 500",
    "rad / h using irradiation by charged hadrons , @xmath13-quanta and neutrons with the average energy of 10 gev , two crystals lost 10@xmath6 , and two other crystals lost 25@xmath6 when they were exposed to 1 krad / h of radiation .",
    "two crystals got extremely high dose rate of 100 krad / h and accumulated about 2.5 mrad absorbed dose ( maximum annual dose of any btev crystals ! ) also with the same mixed particle spectra irradiation .",
    "they remained useable .",
    "their light output loss was a factor of 3 .",
    "this is far from the btev environment , where 700 rad / h will be the highest @xmath9 crystals .",
    "+ there is a correlation between a change in the led signal and a change in the beam ( electron or mip ) signal under irradiation .",
    "the constant of proportionality is different for different crystals and varies from 0.3 to 0.6 for electron irradiation and from 0.5 to 0.9 for pion irradiation .",
    "the non - uniformity ( maximum 0.5@xmath6 per cm at one third of the crystal length ) of the light yield does not change significantly when the dose rate is up to 60 rad / h .",
    "after 2.5 mrad absorbed dose with a dose rate of 100 krad / h the uniformity became 1.5 times poorer , at least for one of our crystals .",
    "when irradiation decreases or stops , crystals recover .",
    "the average recovery time for six crystals which lost from 7 to 20@xmath6 of the led signal , is ( 200@xmath1440 ) hours , and the damage recovery after 400 hours was ( 87@xmath145)@xmath6 .",
    "+ to summarize , lead tungstate crystals lose light from irradiation by high - intensity high - energy beams .",
    "this loss level depends on dose rate .",
    "if dose rate does not change , the light loss saturates . if the dose rate is reduced , the light output recovers .",
    "crystals have to be calibrated continuously during the btev experiment .",
    "we did not see a significant difference in radiation hardness of the crystals from the three manufacturers .",
