    "the detection of x - rays from a supernova is a rare event . while several mechanisms might produce x - ray emission - a thermal flash associated with breakout of the shock from the stellar surface , compton scattered @xmath12-rays from metals synthesized in the explosion , shocked - heated circumstellar matter - only the latter has been detected more than once .",
    "down - scattered @xmath12-rays have been detected only from sn  1987a between 6 and 12 months after the explosion .",
    "strong x - ray emission from shock - heated circumstellar matter occurs only when a relatively large amount of material is located in close proximity to the progenitor .",
    "as this material is generally the product of the pre - supernova stellar mass loss , measuring the x - ray light curve reveals the mass loss history .",
    "as the blast wave propagates outward considerably faster than the wind , the supernova light curve over the course of a few years reveals the mass loss history of the progenitor s final several thousand years .",
    "the total list of supernovae detected in x - rays consists of @xmath024 objects , and is slowly growing as a result of _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and now _ swift _ observations .",
    "long term light curves exist for about half a dozen of these @xcite .",
    "these light curves show a range of behavior , from nearly flat ( e.g. , sn  1979c and sn  1978k since its 1991 discovery ) , to declining at various rates , to more complex behavior ( e.g. , sn  1993j - @xcite ) .",
    "these light curves are decidedly incomplete , however , as data sets consisting of more than four observations exist for only four sne ( sn  1978k , sn  1993j , sn  1998s , sn  1999em ) and only six supernovae have been followed beyond a few years . in this paper",
    "we add sn  1988z to this select group .",
    "sn  1988z is one of a small number of extremely luminous , x - ray emitting supernovae @xcite and is the most distant confirmed x - ray emitter .",
    "sn  1988z was discovered on 1988 dec 12 by two independent observers , c. pollas @xcite and g. candeo @xcite , near the galaxy mcg + 03 - 28 - 022 (= zw 095 - 049 ) .",
    "it was classified as a type ii by @xcite from an optical spectrum .",
    "@xcite confirmed the classification , noting the spectral peculiarities of very blue color and lack of p cyg profiles .",
    "@xcite included it as a member of a new subclass , the type iin supernovae .",

    "@xcite amassed the observations of sn  1988z available as of late 1998 and constructed the first spectral energy distribution for any type iin supernova .",
    "sn  1988z s importance arises from its extreme distance , @xmath093 mpc ( assuming h@xmath13=72 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) .. at a discovery luminosity of @xmath08@xmath110@xmath2 ergs  s@xmath3 , it is also the most luminous .",
    "( this luminosity was revised down to ( 3@xmath141.6)@xmath110@xmath2  ergs  s@xmath3 by @xcite ) .",
    "more importantly , sn  1988z has been proposed by @xcite as the prototype `` compact supernova , '' an event in a high density medium emitting sufficient luminosity to power the broad - line regions of some active galactic nuclei ( e. g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while this idea has fallen out of favor , the existence of sn  1988z suggests that extremely luminous supernovae occur via the proposed mechanism , and are interesting objects of study in their own right .",
    "a second interpretation suggests that the high luminosity arises from shocks driven into dense clumps formed by an unstable stellar wind ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "either mechanism requires a substantial circumstellar envelope .    in this paper",

    "we also extracted counts in several bands ; for example , to match the bandpass of the _ rosat _ hri @xcite , we used the 0.2 - 2 kev band .",
    "there is a larger uncertainty ( and fewer net counts ) in the 0.2 - 2 kev band than in the 0.3 - 2 kev band because of the higher background below 0.3 kev @xcite .",

    "the effects due to event pileup are negligible @xcite .",
    "quantiles have been demonstrated to be more robust than hardness ratios for estimating spectral properties of sources with very limited numbers of counts because they do not generate upper limits @xcite .",
    "for the acis observation , we extracted the photon energy values for the events in the source and background apertures and generated the 25% and 75% quantile values .",
    "figure  [ quantpic ] shows the result of quantile analysis for a coronal ionization equilibrium plasma ( mekal ) grid .",
    "the mekal grid has the depicted shape because of the changing presence of line emission as the temperature ( primarily ) is varied . the quantile analysis yields a preferred temperature of @xmath02 - 3  kev , but the 90% uncertainty covers a very broad range , leaving the temperature high , but essentially undefined .",
    "the preferred column density is 5@xmath110@xmath18 @xmath19 , with a range between 1@xmath110@xmath20 @xmath19 and 2@xmath110@xmath21 @xmath19 .",
    "the broad allowed temperature range can be understood from the relative instability of quantiles using the mekal model caused by the emergence and decline of various lines as the temperature varies .",
    "if we externally constrain the value of the column density by using the galactic value of 1.4@xmath110@xmath22 @xmath19 , then the temperature is constrained to be hotter than @xmath05  kev .",
    "converting the measured count rates into physical units requires estimates of distance and column density plus an assumption about the emission mechanism .",
    "we use different values for all three from those used in previous papers ( @xcite , @xcite ) , as justified below .",
    "we estimated the column density toward sn  1988z using the dust maps of @xcite and the e@xmath23-n@xmath24 relation of @xcite . together",
    "these yield a value of 1.4@xmath110@xmath22 @xmath19 , lower than the 2.5@xmath110@xmath22 @xmath19 from the lower angular resolution maps of @xcite used by @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that the x - ray column density in the immediate vicinity of the supernova could be much higher if the pre - ionized material enshrouding the supenova is only partially ionized , as the partially ionized material will absorb a substantial fraction of the soft x - ray flux .",
    "they estimate that the column density could easily be as high as 10@xmath21 @xmath19 .",
    "the absence of absorption in the radio data suggest this is not the case @xcite . nevertheless it should be noted that the soft x - ray luminosity would be substantially underestimated if we adopt the galactic column density while the supernova instead has a high intrinsic column .    a supernova shock encountering dense circumstellar material or ejecta generally produces a line - rich x - ray spectrum from atomic transitions within nearly stripped ions . given the inferred density of the shocked medium around sn  1988z",
    ", it is expected to rapidly attain collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we therefore use the mekal model for estimating flux and luminosity @xcite .",
    "this is also different from previous publications , which used thermal bremsstrahlung @xcite(table  [ assump_sum ] ) .",
    "if sn  1988z emits copious hard x - rays , then it is possible that the entire surrounding medium has become fully ionized , in which case bremsstrahlung emission would dominate . given the absence of spectral information , either spectral model can be used equally well to infer relative fluxes among the available x - ray observations .",
    "the quantile analysis indicates that if we externally constrain the value of the column density by using the galactic value of 1.4@xmath110@xmath22 @xmath19 , then the temperature is constrained to be hotter than @xmath05  kev . to maintain consistency with the quantile results we assume for our flux estimates a 5  kev plasma with galactic column density .",
    "flux analysis of the x - ray emission from other remnants with higher flux has generally used a temperature of 0.8 kev , inferred from spectral fitting @xcite .",
    "this has been intepreted as the temperature of the reverse shock .",
    "it should be noted that the emissivity of a plasma in the 0.2 - 2.0 kev band varies slowly over the temperature range from 0.5 to 10 kev .",
    "the emissivity for a 0.8 kev plasma is approximately 25 percent higher than a 5 kev plasma .",
    "the acknowledged inconsistency with other analyses resulting from the use here of the higher temperature is however comparable with or smaller than other uncertainties , such as possible temperature evolution between the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ observations .    the recession velocity of mcg  + 03 - 28 - 022 is 6670 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "adopting the value for h@xmath15 of 72 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 consistent with with _",
    "wmap _ and _ hubble _ space telescope measurements @xcite yields a distance to sn  1988z of 93 mpc .",
    "previous papers ( @xcite , @xcite , table  [ assump_sum ] ) assumed a smaller hubble constant value ( h@xmath15 = 50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) and thus inferred a larger distance ( and thus a higher luminosity ) .",
    "table  [ fluxes ] lists the inferred 0.2 - 2.0 and 0.5 - 2.0 kev fluxes and luminosities for the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the inferred flux for the _ rosat _ observations is essentially unchanged , as the reduction due to use of the lower galactic n@xmath25 is offset by the increase due to the higher kt .",
    "the luminosities for the _ rosat _ observations are reduced from those in @xcite by about a factor of two as a consequence of the revised distance . from the original estimate of 2@xmath140.7@xmath110@xmath26  ergs  s@xmath3 @xcite , and",
    "the adjusted value of 8@xmath143.2@xmath110@xmath2  ergs  s@xmath3 @xcite , the peak observed 0.2 - 2.0  kev luminosity is now 3.4@xmath141.2@xmath110@xmath2  ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "of course , estimates of luminosity in other bands also drop by a factor of two as a result of the revised distance .",
    "despite this downward revision , sn  1988z remains the most luminous supernova with a confirmed x - ray detection .",
    "the 0.2 - 2.0 kev fluxes are displayed graphically in figure  [ lc88z ] , the x - ray light curve .",
    "the acis flux is an order of magnitude lower than the initial _ rosat _ hri flux .",
    "a fit to dlog(flux)/dlog(t ) for the 0.2 - 2.0 kev band yields a slope of -2.6@xmath140.6 .",
    "thus the luminosity evolution of sn  1998z in this band follows the curve l@xmath27@xmath28  t@xmath5 .",
    "sn1970 g , with a slope of 2.7@xmath140.9 is the only x - ray supernova with a light curve as steep , but much later in its evolution @xcite .",
    "it is possible to infer information about the density of the gas from the x - ray luminosity , if an assumption is made about the size of the x - ray emitting region .",
    "@xcite show that the h@xmath29 width decrease is consistent with the shock velocity being proportional to t@xmath30 .",
    "if we assume that the h@xmath29 width is a measure of the shock velocity , it is possible to estimate the radius and hence the volume of the region enclosed by the shock for each the four x - ray observations .",
    "the inferred velocity , radius and volume are listed in table  [ density ] .    for a thermal plasma , l@xmath31  =  @xmath32(t)n@xmath33v@xmath31 , where p(t ) is the plasma emissivity , n@xmath34 the electron density , and v@xmath31 the volume of the emitting material . the product n@xmath33 v@xmath31 is referred to as the volume emission measure . for a plasma with a temperature in the range 0.5 - 10.0 kev , the emissivity in the 0.2 - 2.0",
    "kev band is @xmath010@xmath35 erg  @xmath36  s@xmath3 @xcite . in table",
    "[ density ] we have tabulated the value of n@xmath33 v@xmath31 for each of the observations .",
    "the emitting volume v@xmath31 is equal to v@xmath37 , where v is the total volume enclosed by the shock and @xmath37 is the volume filling factor .",
    "table  [ density ] indicates that the value of n@xmath34@xmath38 , the density of the shock - compressed gas , varies from 6.2@xmath110@xmath7 @xmath8 for the first _",
    "observation to 1.1@xmath110@xmath7 @xmath8 for the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "thus the density is high , even for the lowest density case , assuming the plasma uniformly fills the shocked volume .",
    "prior to being shock heated , the density of the ambient gas will be at least a factor of 4 lower than the post shock density .    in table",
    "[ density ] we also list the inferred x - ray emitting mass . in all cases ,",
    "the minimum mass is several solar masses .",
    "the high shock velocity ( @xmath61,000  km  s@xmath3 ) ensures that the bulk of the luminosity emerges in the x - ray band throughout the interval covered by the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the methodology used above for inferring properties of the x - ray emitting gas are similar to those first used by immler and co - workers ( as summarized in @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental difference is that these authors assume a constant shock velocity , whereas we assume one decreasing with time .",
    "if we were to assume a constant velocity , the values we infer for density and mass would be similar , but would be higher or lower , depending upon the velocity we assume .",
    "the rapid decrease of the x - ray emitting mass can in principle be used to set a lower limit on the density and thus constrain the filling factor .",
    "a decline in the emitting mass indicates that the shock - heated material is cooling quickly .",
    "the cooling time t@xmath39 can be written as : t@xmath39  =  0.2 v@xmath40/(n@xmath41@xmath42 )  yr , where v@xmath43 is the shock velocity in units of 10@xmath44 cm s@xmath3 , n@xmath41 is the density in units of 10@xmath45 @xmath8 , and @xmath42 is the plasma emissivity in units of 10@xmath46 erg  @xmath47   s@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the contents of table  [ density ] indicate n@xmath41@xmath480.01 and v@xmath43@xmath481 , adopting @xmath491 .",
    "that the x - ray emitting mass is decreasing at a rate between @xmath00.2 and @xmath01 solar mass per year suggests a cooling time on the order of 1 - 5 years .",
    "such a cooling time requires a density @xmath64@xmath110@xmath7   @xmath47 . as this density lower limit",
    "is consistent with the inferred x - ray emitting gas density , we conclude that a filling factor as large as unity is allowed .",
    "it is also possible to estimate the mass loss rate of the progenitor , if we assume that the circumstellar envelope is due to mass loss . integrating the x - ray emitting mass yields a variable mass loss rate . for the epoch of the initial _",
    "rosat _ observation , corresponding to @xmath04000@xmath1(v@xmath11/10 km s@xmath3 ) years before the explosion , the minumum mass loss rate ( from assuming @xmath37=1 ) is @xmath01.2@xmath110@xmath9 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3v@xmath11/10 km s@xmath3 ) . for the epoch of the _ chandra _ observation , which corresponds to @xmath05500@xmath1(v@xmath11/10 km s@xmath3 ) years before the explosion ,",
    "the minumum mass loss rate is @xmath04@xmath110@xmath17 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3(v@xmath11/10 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray cooling rate requires at least 7 m@xmath50 to have been swept up .",
    "this corresponds to an average mass loss rate of @xmath01.3@xmath110@xmath9 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3(v@xmath11/10 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this range of mass loss rates lie at the extreme end of those inferred for x - ray supernovae @xcite , as would be expected given its high luminosity .",
    "we assumed above that the gas is in collisional ionization equilibrium . for a shock - heated plasma",
    ", cie is attained when the product n@xmath34t@xmath610@xmath51@xmath8 s. the inferred gas densities require t@xmath01 - 8@xmath110@xmath44@xmath38 s = 3 - 24@xmath38 yr to reach equilibrium .",
    "thus the equilibration time is comparable with the cooling time , and the assumption of cie is justified .",
    "the x - ray fluxes require n@xmath34@xmath38 to decline with time .",
    "since l@xmath31@xmath28 t@xmath52 and n@xmath34@xmath38@xmath28 l@xmath53 , we expect n@xmath34@xmath38@xmath28 t@xmath54 .",
    "the data do not allow determination of whether the density declines while the filling factor remains constant , the filling factor declines while the density remains constant , or both change with time . in the discussion",
    "below , we consider the implications of a decline of density and filling factor in the context of models proposed for sn  1988z .",
    "two distinct models have been proposed to explain the multiband light curve of sn 1988z .",
    "one postulates that the supernova exploded in an extremely dense ( @xmath010@xmath45  @xmath8 ) medium ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as the supernova shock propagates through such a medium , it loses energy rapidly , and evolves in a matter of years to the `` shell forming , '' or radiative stage .",
    "extremely high luminosities are produced as the sn radiates away most of its kinetic energy over decades .",
    "the second model postulates propagation of the sn shock through a clumpy medium , formed by an unstable wind from a progenitor star that underwent extreme mass loss ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the forward shock propagates rapidly outward , driving slower shocks into the clumps it encounters .",
    "x - ray ( and radio ) emission arises from the shocked clumps .",
    "below we address how the predictions of these two models compare with the _ chandra _ observation and the inferred x - ray light curve .",
    "@xcite provide a capsule summary of the so - called `` compact supernova '' model , and compare optical , radio , and x - ray data from sn  19988z with the model predictions .",
    "they show that the light curves in many bands ( for the first decade after the explosion ) follow trends similar to the model predictions .",
    "they also show that the shock velocity , which they infer from the width of the h@xmath29 line , follows the t@xmath30 behavior predicted from the model .",
    "( we have used this inference above in our estimate of the radius enclosed by the shock . )",
    "they predict that the bolometric luminosity should decline as t@xmath55 .",
    "as their model also predicts that the bulk of the luminosity is emitted in the x - ray band , the x - ray luminosity should follow this decay curve .",
    "the _ rosat _ fluxes appear to fit this pattern .",
    "they estimate an average density on the order of 10@xmath45  @xmath8 .",
    "this model runs into difficulty when it is compared with the extended x - ray light curve .",
    "the measured t@xmath5 is not consistent with the prediction .",
    "the assumption of a constant density of @xmath010@xmath45  @xmath8 is challenged by the decline in n@xmath38 required by the x - ray flux measurements .",
    "a constant density of @xmath010@xmath45  @xmath8 requires a small filling factor that decreases with time ( from 3.6@xmath110@xmath9 at the time of the first _ rosat _ observation to 1.2@xmath110@xmath17 at the time of the _ chandra _ observation ) .",
    "if the x - ray emitting gas is confined to a shell , its thickness also decreases , from @xmath02@xmath110@xmath56  cm to @xmath01@xmath110@xmath57  cm .",
    "additionally , the model is inconsistent with the late - time radio spectrum , which shows little free - free absorption @xcite from the intervening material composing the cocoon in which the supernova exploded .",
    "there are two ways to potentially reconcile these difficulties .",
    "first , it is conceivable that the bulk of the luminosity has shifted out of the x - ray band .",
    "this is not likely , based on the inferred shock velocity from the h@xmath29 line width measurements . even if the velocity is overestimated by a factor of two at the time of the _ chandra",
    "_ measurement , the bulk of the emission should still arise in the x - ray band .",
    "second , it is possible that the supernova shock has encountered a change in the average medium density .",
    "this possibility can not be ruled out , given the small number of measurements postdating @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is possible that the shock recently broke through the dense cocoon into a low - density medium . in that case , the x - ray light curve , which until the _ chandra _ observation could be characterized by a -11/7 slope , might show a pronounced break .",
    "if the change occurred at day 4500 , roughly midway between the final _ rosat _ and the _ chandra _ observations , then the light curve from day 4500 to the _ chandra _ observation would have and extremely steep decline : l@xmath58@xmath28  t@xmath59 .",
    "the two steepest light curves observed are those of this remnant and sn  1970 g @xcite . therefore , while the _ chandra _ flux measurement does not exclude the compact supernova model , the required steep late - time decline entails significant modification of the model .",
    "@xcite champion the alternative model , whereby the high radio luminosity is produced by slow shocks driven into dense clumps of wind material .",
    "they assume a constant shock velocity through the interclump medium ( 20,000  km  s@xmath3 , as was observed early in the evolution of sn  1988z @xcite ) . using this assumption , and the theoretical framework of @xcite",
    ", they interpret the radio light curve as arising from a medium with a low cloud number density ( filling factor ) .",
    "they quantify neither the filling factor , nor the density of the clumps or interclump medium , but they infer a mass loss rate of 1.2@xmath110@xmath17 m@xmath15  yr@xmath3 , and a corresponding @xmath60/w@xmath61 = 7.3@xmath110@xmath51  g  cm@xmath3 .",
    "the key observation driving this interpretation is that the radio light curve between days 1750 and 5000 has a -2.7 slope .",
    "this slope is essentially identical to the x - ray decline between days 2355 and 5678 . while sn radio and x - ray light curves are generally correlated , and",
    "all x - ray supernovae are detected in the radio , none has been observed to have exactly the same slope ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the x - ray light curve should have a shallower slope .",
    "since the x - ray and h@xmath29 fluxes depend on n@xmath33 while the radio light curve depends on n@xmath63 , the x - ray light curve should follow the h@xmath29 light curve , which @xcite show is consistent with a -2.1 slope . for our case , since the filling factor decreases while the volume increases with time , a simple interpretation might be a shock running through a clumpy medium . based on the clumpy medium model , a light curve with slope",
    "-2.1 is marginally consistent with the x - ray data .    as a matter of interest , @xcite",
    "show that the radio and h@xmath29 light curves steepened significantly after day 1750 .",
    "they interpret this steepening as evidence for a decrease in the number density of clumps . as none of the x - ray observations",
    "were performed before day 1750 , we do not know whether the x - ray light curve also changed slope .",
    "whatever the physical reason behind it might be , the fact that one slope change has been observed , however , supports the possibility of a second steepening during the last few years .",
    "all the observations listed in @xcite were performed before day 4500 .",
    "if we assume that the x - ray light curve followed a -2.1 slope until that time ( allowed by the _ rosat _",
    "fluxes ) , and then decreased more rapidly after that date , then a slope of at least -2.8 is required for consistency with the _ chandra _ flux point , which corresponds to a radio slope of -3.9 .",
    "again , no x - ray light curve this steep has ever been measured .    in summary ,",
    "neither model is consistent with all of the observations .",
    "aretxaga et al .",
    "( 1999 ) assume a dense , uniform shell .",
    "this should result in self - absorption of the radio emission which becomes smaller with time .",
    "williams et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show that the self - absorption is small , and constant , suggesting radio emission is not being produced within a dense cocoon .",
    "if the intense uv and x - ray radiation keep this material ionized , then little or no intrinsic absorption of soft x - rays might be detected at this time .",
    "the highest allowed column density from the quantile analysis is 5@xmath110@xmath21 of neutral material .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , assume a constant , high shock velocity of 20,000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this is not consistent with the smooth velocity decline suggested by the h@xmath29 width . from the x - ray standpoint ,",
    "the light curve is at odds with both models .",
    "both predict flatter x - ray decays than observed : -11/7 , and -2.1 compared with the measured -2.6 .",
    "but the current x - ray observations do not rule out either model .",
    "the ambiguity presented by the limited x - ray data could be largely removed by a single additional observation",
    ". such an observation will show whether the light curve has a shallower average slope than inferred from the existing x - ray observations , continues to track the -2.6 slope , or steepened after the _ rosat _ observations .",
    "if the slope is flatter , then it could support either model and possibly provide a discriminator between them , depending on whether it is closer to the -11/7 predicted by the compact supernova model or -2.1 predicted by the clump model . as described above , a change in slope could rescue either model , but would require a change in the properties of the medium being encountered by the shock .",
    "if the slope is constant at -2.6 , then a different model must be sought which explains the x - ray light curve in the context of the numerous other observations . additionally , radio observations are needed to show whether the x - ray and radio light curves continue to follow each other .",
    "it is possible to compare the inferred density profile with those of other x - ray emitting sne . @xcite",
    "plot the density profiles for several x - ray sne , and show ; we made the change to conform to our notation . ] that @xmath64  r@xmath65 , where _ s _ ranges between 1 and 2 . the inferred density ( or more precisely @xmath66 )",
    "follows a r@xmath54 profile , entirely within this range . in calculating their density profiles ,",
    "@xcite assume a constant shock velocity .",
    "in contrast to this assumption , we have assumed that the shock velocity profile of sn  1988z is known , and that the shock decelerates .",
    "a comparison with the inferred density for , e.g. , sn  1979c indicates that its inferred density range is comparable to the range of @xmath66 for sn  1988z .",
    "this could be interpreted as suggesting that the actual density is substantially higher , and thus @xmath37 is much less than unity ( or that the shock velocity decreases in the other sne , leading to different density profiles ) .",
    "an acis observation yields a clear detection of sn  1988z 16 years after discovery , and a decade after the first x - ray detection .",
    "although limited spectral information is available , the x - ray light curve constructed using this observation and the three archival _ rosat _ observations yields a flux decline proportional to t@xmath5 . this decline is steeper than predicted by either of the two prominent competing models .",
    "the inferred density is high , larger than 10@xmath7  @xmath8 , indicating a massive envelope around the progenitor , and requiring rapid evolution of the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "if the circumstellar envelope is the result of presupernova mass loss , a very high mass loss rate is required , as might be expected from this , the most x - ray luminous supernova .",
    "an additional observation can potentially discriminate between the two competing models , or require a new model .",
