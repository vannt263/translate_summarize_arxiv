    "the two most fundamental parameters of a star are its mass and its radius . for a given stellar mass ,",
    "models try to reproduce the radius of the star by implementing the best known stellar interior and atmospheric physics . for stars more massive than the sun , convective interior and radiative atmosphere models reproduce well the observations ( e.g. andersen 1991 , 1997 ) .",
    "the atmospheres of these stars are dominated by atomic species and their interiors can be closely modeled as an ideal gas .",
    "as detailed in the physics of low - mass stars review paper by chabrier & baraffe ( 2000 ) , below 1@xmath3 we enter a new physics domain where molecular compounds begin to form in the atmospheres of the stars as their effective temperature drops , and convection expands to the outer layers of the star , until the objects become fully convective below @xmath4 0.35 @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the interior of the stars becomes denser , and the conditions begin to resemble those of a partially degenerate plasma .",
    "therefore the ideal gas equation of state no longer applies .",
    "recent measurements of k and m dwarfs radii using both eclipsing binaries and interferometry reveal a disagreement between models and observations . as a general trend , the measured radii appear to be larger than the predictions by the models by factors as large as 2030% , in some cases .",
    "two main hypotheses have been suggested to explain this disagreement .",
    "the first hypothesis suggests that the discrepancies between models and observations are caused by differences on the level of activity of the stars ( lpez - morales & ribas 2005 ; ribas 2006 ) .",
    "the models by mullan & mcdonald ( 2001 ) conclude that the larger radii may be caused by the inhibition of convection in stars with strong magnetic fields , or equivalently , with high rotational velocities .",
    "the second hypothesis suggests that the discrepancies between models and observations are caused by differences in metallicity ( berger et al .",
    ". however , the best current models ( baraffe et al . 1998 ) yield radii values that only differ by about 3% for metallicities between -0.50.0 dex .",
    "this suggests that the models could be missing some important source of opacity , as indidated by the authors .",
    "a larger range of metallicities in the models is also needed .",
    "the effort of several groups has provided a current sample of 48 radii measurements for k and m main sequence stars .",
    "berger et al . ( 2006 ) , sgrensan et al . ( 2003 ) and lane et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have measured the radii of 14 single nearby dwarfs through interferometry .",
    "the radii of another 34 stars , members of eclipsing binaries , have been measured by different groups ( see references in table 1 ) .",
    "many of the stars in the sample have metallicity estimations and measured x - ray fluxes , a good of magnetic activity indicator ( pevtsov et al . 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , there are now enough data to begin testing possible correlations between the radii of the stars , their activity levels , and their metallicities .",

    "the sample includes 48 objects with masses between 0.092 and 0.960 @xmath3 , covering the entire range of stellar masses between 1 @xmath3 and the brown dwarf limit .",

    "for all the other objects , i.e. fainter binaries and single stars with radii measured through interferometry , the error bars are larger , typically 510% . in the binaries ,",
    "the masses and radii of the stars can be measured directly from the light and radial velocity curves of the systems . in the case of single stars ,",
    "interferometry provides direct measurements of the stellar radii , but the masses need to be derived using external calibrations .",
    "berger et al . ( 2006 ) , sgransan et al . ( 2003 ) and lane et al . (",

    "( 2000 ) and the mass-@xmath5 relation by henry & mccarthy ( 1993 ) .",
    "the authors adopted errors of 510% in the derived masses to account for photometric and empirical fitting errors .",
    "determination of the metallicity of low - mass stars is a difficult task , since as the spectral type of the stars increases , i.e. their effective temperature decreases , absorption bands from molecules such as tio , vo , @xmath60 , co and cn begin to appear in the spectra , causing the spectral continuum to be underestimated .",

    "values of the metallicity of cm dra have been derived by several authors using both spectral analysis and comparisons with isochrone models ( chabrier & baraffe 1995 ; leggett et al .",

    "however , those metallicity estimations have not been used , since the are based on model fits and the purpose of this work is to compare models to observations .",
    "most objects in the sample with apparent magnitudes brighter than v = 14 appear as x - ray sources in the rosat all - sky bright star catalog ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) , with typical position offsets between the optical sources and their x - ray counterparts of less than 20 - 30 arcsec .",

    "since the stars in the sample cover a wide range of masses , and therefore radii , the x - ray  to  bolometric luminosity ratio , @xmath13 , gives a more accurate estimate of the relative activity level differences between the stars .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of the stars have been computed from the measured radii and effective temperatures of the objects listed in tables 1 and 2 .    in the case of the binaries ,",
    "the x - ray luminosities derived above correspond to the combined contribution from the two stars .",
    "therefore , it was necessary to device a way to estimate the x - ray luminosity of each component .",
    "all the binaries in the sample with detected x - ray emission have orbital periods of less than 6 days ( in fact , only v818 tau has p @xmath14 3 days ) , and orbital solutions consistent with e=0.0 , i.e. circular orbits ( see references in table 2 ) .",
    "the rotational and orbital periods of the stars are therefore expected to be synchronized by tidal interaction .",
    "based on this assumption , the rotational velocity of the stars can be computed from their radii and the orbital period of the systems .",
    "this assumption is in fact necessary in the cases where no direct rotational velocity measurements are available ( see last paragraph in this section ) .",
    "the secondary stars in the binaries are expected to have slightly slower rotational velocities than the primaries , and one would therefore intuitively expect their magnetic fields to be slightly weaker than the magnetic fields of the primaries .",
    "x - ray coronal emission has been found to be correlated with stellar rotation in active t - tauri and late - type main sequence single stars ( e.g. bouvier 1990 ; fleming et al .",

    ", the sample includes stars with a wide range of magnetic activity levels and metallicities .",
    "there is in this case a significant scatter in radius for any given stellar mass .",
    "that scatter can be attributed to differences in the magnetic activity level and the metallicity of the stars , as shown in  3 .",
    "the radii of the stars do not appear to be correlated with magnetic activity in the case of slow rotators .",
    "slow rotators are usually single stars , old enough to have had time to slow down rotationally .",
    "the typical rotational velocities of these objects are less than 5 km @xmath2 .",
    "however , there is a clear correlation between radius and magnetic activity in the case of faster rotating , more magnetically active , stars .",
    "it has been postulated in previous papers ( e.g. lpez - morales & ribas 2005 ) that the significant areal coverage of active regions ( spots ) on the surface of magnetically active stars changes the overall photospheric temperature of the stars ; an effect that they could compensate by increasing their radii to conserve their total radiative fluxes .",
    "torres et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have compared the radii of two fast rotators ( v1061 cyg ab and fl lyr b ) and two slow rotators ( rw lac a and hs aur a ) of similar mass and find the fast rotators to have larger radii than what the models predict .",
    "the theoretical work by mullan & mcdonald ( 2001 ) concludes that inhibition of convection in fast rotating stars may be the cause of their larger radii .",
    "this might be the case not only for low - mass stars in close binaries , but also for young single stars and t tauri objects , which are usually very active .",
    "metallicity also appears to be playing a role in the radii of the stars .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the size of the stars and how metal rich they are .",
    "this correlation , already noted by berger et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , appears to apply to single stars , but not to the components of binaries .",
    "however , this last conclusion is still premature , since only a handful of the low - mass stars in binaries have metallicity estimations .",
    "furthermore , most of those metallicity estimations are indirect .",
    "direct metallicity measurements of the components of low - mass binaries are needed to determine any correlation with the radii of the stars .",
    "an increasing abundance of metals would have the effect of enhancing the number density of molecular compounds in the atmospheres of the stars , making it harder for the radiation to escape .",
    "the response of the stars might be similar to the case of high magnetic activity , i.e. they could increase their radii to conserve their radiative fluxes .",

    "<S> the recent burst in the number of radii measurements of very low - mass stars from eclipsing binaries and interferometry of single stars has opened more questions about what can be causing the discrepancy between the observed radii and the ones predicted by the models . </S>",
    "<S> the two main explanations being proposed are a correlation between the radius of the stars and their activity levels or their metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a study of such correlations using all the data published to date . </S>",
    "<S> the study also investigates correlations between the radii deviation from the models and the masses of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> there is no clear correlation between activity level and radii for the single stars in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> those single stars are slow rotators with typical velocities @xmath0 @xmath1 3.0 km @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a clear correlation however exists in the case of the faster rotating members of binaries . </S>",
    "<S> this result is based on the of x - ray emission levels of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> there also appears to be an increase in the deviation of the radii of single stars from the models as a function of metallicity , as previously indicated by berger et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stars in binaries do not seem to follow the same trend . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the baraffe et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1998 ) models reproduce well the radius observations below 0.300.35 @xmath3 , where the stars become fully convective , although this result is preliminary since almost all the sample stars in that mass range are slow rotators and metallicities have not been measured for most of them . </S>",
    "<S> the results in this paper indicate that stellar activity and metallicity play an important role on the determination of the radius of very low - mass stars , at least above 0.35@xmath3 . </S>"
