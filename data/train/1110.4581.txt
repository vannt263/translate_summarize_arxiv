    "there is an @xmath0 global anomaly @xcite violating the baryon @xmath1 and lepton @xmath2 numbers by an equal amount in the @xmath3 standard model ( sm ) . at the finite temperatures @xmath4 , the anomalous process becomes strong due to an instanton - like solution , the so - called sphalerons @xcite . during the sphaleron epoch , neither the baryon asymmetry nor the lepton asymmetry",
    "can survive if the baryon and lepton asymmetries are equal .",
    "however , the sphaleron processes will not affect any primordial @xmath5 asymmetry and will convert the @xmath5 asymmetry to a baryon asymmetry and a lepton asymmetry @xcite .",
    "so , a successful baryogenesis mechanism working above the weak scale should require a @xmath5 number violation which is a pure baryon number violation , a pure lepton number violation or a combined baryon and lepton violation .",
    "the baryon and/or lepton number violation can lead to other interesting phenomena .",
    "for example , we can obtain a majorana neutrino mass term by a lepton number violation of two units , a neutron - antineutron oscillation by a baryon number violation of two units , as well as a two - body proton decay by a baryon number violation of one unit and a lepton number violation of one unit .    in the simplest grand unified theories ( guts ) ,",
    "a baryon asymmetry and an equal lepton asymmetry can be simultaneously produced at the gut scale through some baryon and lepton number violating interactions , which are also responsible for generating a @xmath5 conserving proton decay . in this gut baryogenesis scenario , the baryon and lepton asymmetries will be both wiped out by the sphaleron processes",
    ".    in this paper we shall show it is possible to realize the baryogenesis and the proton decay by same interactions .",
    "for this purpose , we shall extend the sm by an isotriplet and two isosinglet leptoquark scalars , two isotriplet higgs scalars as well as three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos will softly break the lepton number while the trilinear scalar couplings involving the higgs triplets will softly break both of the baryon and lepton numbers .",
    "the @xmath5 number violating processes involving the right - handed neutrinos will be assumed to decouple before the out - of - equilibrium decays of the higgs triplets .",
    "so , the @xmath5 asymmetry from the decays of the higgs triplets into the leptoquarks can explain the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "after the higgs triplets pick up their seesaw - suppressed vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , the leptoquarks can mediate a @xmath5 violating decay @xcite of the proton into two antineutrinos and one positron or antimuon .",

    "the neutrino oscillation experiments have given some information on the neutrino masses and mixing such as @xcite    @xmath27    furthermore , the cosmological observations @xcite have put an upper bound on the sum of the neutrino mass eigenvalues , @xmath28",
    "we assume that the lepton number violating processes involving the right - handed neutrinos will decouple before the decays of the higgs triplets and then the final @xmath5 asymmetry should be generated by the decays of the higgs triplets .",

    "we can calculate the tree - level decay width : @xmath42 and the one - loop cp asymmetries :    @xmath43    when the higgs triplets @xmath17 go out of equilibrium , their cp violating decays can generate a @xmath5 asymmetry in the leptoquarks @xmath44 and @xmath45 as well as the leptons @xmath46 .",
    "for example , we consider the weak washout region , where the out - of - equilibrium condition can be described by the following quantity , @xmath47 the induced @xmath5 asymmetry then can approximate to @xcite @xmath48 where the factor @xmath49 means the three components of the decaying higgs triplets . if @xmath50 is much lighter than @xmath51 , the final @xmath5 asymmetry should come from the decays of @xmath50 . alternatively , if @xmath52 and @xmath53 have a small mass split , both of them will significantly contribute to the final @xmath5 asymmetry . in this case , the cp asymmetry could be resonantly enhanced @xcite .",
    "since the leptoquarks decays into the leptons and the quarks , their @xmath5 asymmetries can be transferred to a baryon asymmetry and a lepton asymmetry through the sphaleron processes .",
