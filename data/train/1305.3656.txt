    "ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) are a class of stellar systems that was discovered in the fornax galaxy cluster more than a decade ago @xcite . since then , ucds have been discovered in other galaxy clusters @xcite , galaxy groups @xcite , as well as isolated spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "ucds are typically defined to have half - light radii @xmath2 and masses @xmath3 m@xmath4 @xcite , making them an intermediate object between globular clusters ( gcs ) and dwarf galaxies .",
    "the formation mechanism of ucds is currently unknown , although a number of scenarios have been proposed .",
    "the simplest explanation is that they are the high - mass end of the gc mass function observed around galaxies with rich gc systems @xcite .",
    "since ucds have larger sizes than typical gcs , they may form from the merger of many gcs @xcite .",
    "alternatively , they could be dwarf galaxies stripped by tidal interactions such that only their central nuclei remain , referred to as the tidal stripping or `` threshing '' scenario @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence suggesting ucds are formed by a combination of mechanisms rather than a single one @xcite .",
    "tidally stripped dwarf galaxies , in particular nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies ( de , ns ) , have been proposed as ucd progenitors for a number of reasons : ucds and dwarf elliptical nuclei have similar internal velocity dispersions @xcite and colour - magnitude trends @xcite .",
    "ucds lie above the metallicity - luminosity trend for early - type galaxies and have a similar metallicity to dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "such a situation would be expected if ucds are tidally stripped dwarf galaxies since the luminosity would decrease while the metallicity remains high .",
    "in addition , some ucds are surrounded by stellar haloes which might be the remnants of the stripped dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "finally , irregular objects with asymmetric extensions have been found which may be dwarf galaxy nuclei undergoing tidal stripping @xcite .",
    "simulations of ucd formation in the tidal stripping scenario were first performed by @xcite , who showed that nucleated dwarf galaxies orbiting in a galaxy cluster on highly eccentric orbits are almost completely tidally stripped , with only the nucleus surviving . in this case the size and luminosity of the stripped galaxy are such that it would be classified as a ucd .",
    "more recently , @xcite sought to understand ucd formation by tidal stripping within the context of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , and found the cosmological prediction matches the observed spatial distribution of ucds .    despite this , a number of potential problems with the tidal stripping scenario still remain unanswered .",
    "@xcite have recently found a population of extended , low mass ucds ( @xmath5 pc , @xmath6 ) in the virgo galaxy cluster which do not follow the size - magnitude relation observed for the most massive ucds @xcite .",
    "such objects may form from merged star cluster complexes @xcite , however it is unclear whether they can be formed in either the giant gc or tidal stripping scenario .",
    "ucds are typically @xmath7 times larger than de nuclei at the same luminosity @xcite .",
    "this suggests that if nuclei are the ucd progenitors the nuclei must undergo expansion , or some other process , during tidal stripping .",
    "the situation is even more pronounced for nuclei and ucds with @xmath8 : at this luminosity the typical half - light radius of nuclei is @xmath9 pc , while ucds extend up to @xmath10 pc @xcite .",
    "all tidal stripping simulations to date have been performed in static , spherical galaxy potentials with a constant pericentre and apocentre @xcite , thus it is uncertain what effect an evolving or triaxial potential has on the number and properties of the ucds that form in this scenario . in addition , these studies did not investigate if tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies affects the nucleus size , thus the origin of the size difference between ucds and de nuclei is still uncertain .    in this paper",
    "we perform high resolution @xmath1-body simulations of a nucleated dwarf galaxy being stripped via tidal interactions to test whether the extended , low mass ucds can be formed in the tidal stripping scenario .",
    "we simulate orbits with fixed pericentres and apocentres , as well as orbits that mimic ` box orbits ' in an evolving or triaxial potential , to study the effect of the dwarf galaxy s orbit on the final size of the stripped dwarf galaxy .    @ccccccccccc@ simulation & orbit & de , n & apocentre & pericentre & close & final & final & formation & simulation + no . &",

    "we test for nucleus expansion in the tidal stripping scenario with two types of orbits .",
    "first we assume that de galaxies orbit the central galaxy on elliptic orbits with fixed apocentre and pericentre distances .",
    "for all de , n models we test orbits with apocentres of 50 and 100 kpc and pericentres of 2 , 5 , 10 and 20 kpc .",
    "such highly eccentric orbits are predicted by @xmath57cdm simulations for sub - haloes orbiting larger haloes @xcite .    since",
    "elliptical galaxies are expected to reside in triaxial potentials and form through galaxy mergers , galaxy cluster potentials will be neither static nor spherical .",
    "the orbits of dwarf galaxies in such clusters may be chaotic with strongly varying pericentres distances during successive passages , either due to the triaxial potential or encounters with other galaxies during the orbit .",
    "thus in addition to the elliptic orbit , we consider the case where only a few encounters between the de and central galaxy will happen with very small pericentre distances , and at all other times the de is far from the central galaxy so that tidal effects are not important .",
    "we mimic such a scenario by simulating 1 - 3 pericentre passages and then placing the object on a circular orbit at apocentre to allow enough time for unbound particles to escape .",

    "de , n models we test box orbits with apocentres of 50 and 100 kpc and pericentres of 2 and 5 kpc .",

    "if the extended , low mass ucds form by tidal stripping , one would expect to see transition objects in the size gap .",
    "the absence or small number of objects in this region might imply different situations for ucd formation by tidal stripping : either the formation time is very short , or the tidal stripping occurred long ago , i.e. when the cluster formed .",
    "our results show that ucds on box orbits , which are necessary to form the extended ucds , have typical formation times of 1 - 2 gyr ( see table [ results_table ] ) , in agreement with the first scenario .",
    "however , since most ucds are @xmath72 - 11 gyr old @xcite , while most de nuclei are a few gyr old @xcite , this implies that most ucds formed before the young de nuclei were formed , otherwise one could expect to find more young ucds .",
    "but note that de nuclei with young ages might not be young at all , they might have formed long ago but had ongoing star formation or new star formation events at recent times .",
    "therefore either of these points , or a combination of the two , may explain the lack of transition objects between dwarf galaxies and ucds .     and half the object mass for all simulated ucds compared with the initial cumulative mass profiles for the models ( solid lines ) and final cumulative mass profiles for simulations 22 , 30 and 38 ( box orbits with one pericentre passage at 2 kpc and a 50 kpc apocentre / circular orbit for models 1 , 2 and 3 respectively , dashed lines ) .",

    "if the origin of the size difference between ucds and de nuclei is due to expansion of the nucleus during tidal stripping the cumulative mass profiles of the final ucds should differ from that of the initial nucleus of the model .",
    "[ half - mass ] shows that the final ucd profiles differ little from nucleus of the initial models , and the mass and half - mass radius of the simulated ucds trace the initial model nucleus , with the exception of the most massive ucds for each model which have a significant stellar halo .",
    "this indicates expansion plays little role in the final ucd sizes .",
    "although the model 1 elliptic orbit simulations show some deviation from the mass profile with increasing radius , this is most likely caused by numerical relaxation and not a real effect .",
    "based on this result we expect that ucds outside our sequence can be formed by models with different luminosities for the nucleus . given the range of luminosities for de nuclei in fig .",

    "n is strongly stripped by the first two pericentre passages at 90 and 270 myr and the final ucd has a size and mass resembling the initial nucleus of the model . for the box orbit ,",
    "most of the envelope becomes unbound due to the pericentre passage at 90 myr and subsequently escapes during the orbit at apocentre , while the nucleus remains unaffected by the encounter .",
    "the final mass of the object is approximately twice that of the initial nucleus .",
    "since our set - up procedure does not distinguish between nucleus and envelope particles we are unable to determine which particles escape , however , naively one would expect the envelope particles to become unbound before the nucleus particles . under this assumption all particles in the nucleus would be retained while 50 per cent of the final ucd mass comes from the envelope .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ sb_profile ] the final profile has a stellar halo , which is visible as a deviation from a single component profile at a surface brightness of @xmath73 mag arcsec@xmath24 . in general , for models with a nucleus @xmath38 pc ( model 1 ) stellar haloes become visible for ucds with sizes larger than @xmath74 pc , while for models with a nucleus @xmath39 pc ( model 2 and 3 ) stellar haloes become visible for ucds with sizes larger than @xmath75 - 60 pc . for all simulations the halo does not become apparent until a surface brightness of 22 - 23 mag arcsec@xmath24 . for simulation 22 ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ sb_profile ] ) , it is unclear whether a halo would be observable because if random gaussian noise with a standard deviation of @xmath76 mag arcsec@xmath24 is added to simulate observational uncertainties , the profile is fit well by both a king profile and a two - component profile ( king profile with a srsic profile for the halo ) .",
    "this indicates that some ucds which only have a single component surface brightness profile could be composed of the nucleus and remaining envelope from the initial de , n .",
    "however , for the more massive and extended simulated ucds the stellar halo is clearly visible .",
    "the result that ucds formed by tidal stripping are composed of stars from both the nucleus and envelope of the progenitor de , n has an important implication .",
    "nuclei of de , ns often have different metallicities from the envelope @xcite , which suggests that ucds with two - components , as well as some that have only a single component profile ( e.g. right panel in fig .",
    "[ sb_profile ] ) , most likely contain populations with different metallicities or a metallicity gradient .",
    "this prediction may be tested with future observations .",
    "tidal streams are an inevitable consequence of the tidal stripping scenario and therefore must be present if ucds form in this way . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ sb_profile ] the final profile is embedded in a tidal stream , which becomes dominant in the surface brightness profile at a surface brightness of @xmath77 mag arcsec@xmath24 and a radius of @xmath78 pc . for all simulations the tidal streams have surface brightnesses fainter than @xmath77 mag arcsec@xmath24 after 2 gyr .",
    "only box orbit simulations with 50 kpc apocentres have tidal streams with surface brightnesses brighter than 28 mag arcsec@xmath24 in the final profiles , while all other simulations have tidal streams with surface brightnesses fainter than 28 mag arcsec@xmath24 .",
    "it is probable the tidal streams would disperse faster in reality due to substructure in the galaxy cluster and thus tidal streams are only likely to be observed around ucds still undergoing significant stripping .    for both the elliptic and box orbit in fig .",
    "[ sb_profile ] the inner region ( within @xmath79 - 10 pc ) changes little throughout the simulation . by fitting a king profile to the innermost region of the final surface brightness profiles for all models",
    "we find the core radius typically changes by less than 10 per cent of the initial core radius of the nucleus ( de , n model 1 has a nucleus core radius of 1.5 pc while de , n models 2 and 3 both have a nucleus core radius of 3.7 pc ) .",
    "this suggests the surface brightness profiles of ucds formed by tidal stripping should have the same core radius as their progenitor de nucleus .",
    "we have performed simulations of nucleated dwarf galaxies undergoing tidal stripping in a virgo - like galaxy cluster to form ucds . using the particle - mesh code superbox ,",
    "we have performed 45 simulations with varying orbital parameters to test the effect of the dwarf galaxy s orbit on the size of the ucd formed due to the stripping of the dwarf s outer envelope .",
    "we find that repeated close passages which occur during elliptic orbits lead to the formation of compact star clusters / ucds , and elliptic orbits can only reproduce the full range of ucd sizes if the de nuclei have half - light radii @xmath80 pc .",
    "given a large fraction of de nuclei have half - light radii @xmath66 pc ( including almost all nuclei with luminosities @xmath8 ) , we consider tidal stripping on elliptic orbits unlikely to be the dominant mechanism for ucd formation .",
    "in contrast orbital motion in box orbits , or other orbits where very close pericentre passages happen only once or twice and at all other times the stripped dwarf galaxy is far from the centre of a major galaxy , lead to the formation of extended objects resembling ucds regardless of the nucleus half - light radius .",
    "for such box orbits the dwarf galaxies need close pericentre passages with distances less than 10 kpc to undergo strong enough stripping so that ucd formation is possible .",
    "observations suggest that the nuclei must expand by a factor of two to account for the size difference between ucds and de nuclei @xcite , however we find the nuclei expand little during the tidal stripping process . instead , the stripped de , n galaxies can resemble the extended ucds by retaining more mass than contained within the initial nucleus , causing the ucds to be more extended . during the stripping process the envelope profile steepens , and in some cases the ucd can appear to have a single component profile despite being composed of both the nucleus and remnant envelope . for all orbits considered in our simulations ,",
    "the typical ucd size is 2 - 3 times the initial de nucleus size , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .    despite the simulated ucds",
    "having more mass than the initial nucleus , we find only the extended ucds have stellar haloes . for the de ,",
    "n models with a compact nucleus ( @xmath38 pc ) we find haloes only become visible for objects with a half - light radius greater than @xmath81 pc , while for de , n models with a larger nucleus ( @xmath39 pc ) a halo becomes visible for a half - light radius larger than @xmath82 - 60 pc . for both nuclei",
    "sizes the halo tends to become visible in the surface brightness profile at @xmath83 - 23 mag arcsec@xmath24 and between @xmath72 - 100 pc , however , the position this occurs at for a given ucd will depend strongly on the mass profile of the progenitor de , n ( in particular on the king concentration for the nucleus and sersic index for the envelope ) and remaining mass in the envelope .",
    "some observed ucds , in particular the most extended ones , are better fit by two - component models @xcite , while deviations from single - component king models at a surface brightness of @xmath83 - 23 mag arcsec@xmath24 can be seen qualitatively in some of the observed surface brightness profiles of ucds ( e.g. the profiles for ucd16 and ucd33 ) , in agreement with our results .",
    "given our results suggesting the nuclei undergo little expansion and retain the core radius of their progenitor de nucleus , we predict that high mass ucds ( @xmath64 ) should have cores ranging up to @xmath84 pc due to the large range in nuclei sizes at higher luminosities , assuming most progenitor nuclei have half - light radii below 20 pc .",
    "in contrast , most low mass ucds should have profiles with cores up to a few parsec , since most nuclei in this range have half - light radii of @xmath9 pc .",
    "this range is consistent for the ucds in the fornax and virgo clusters which have king core radii in the range 2 - 7 pc @xcite .",
    "no surface brightness profiles are available for the extended , low luminosity ucds ( @xmath85 pc , @xmath6 ) as yet but this prediction may be tested with future observations .    although we simulated a de with a nucleus of @xmath86 and @xmath87 pc ( model 3 ) there",

    "[ half - mass ] imply a de , n with a nucleus of @xmath86 and @xmath88 pc will evolve during tidal stripping in a similar way to model 3 , up until @xmath89 pc when the nucleus starts to become dominant in the mass profile . after this point the ucd would be more compact than model 3 for a given luminosity , similar to the situation between models 1 and 2 .",
    "the most massive nuclei in fig .",

    "our simulations show that tidally stripped de , ns resulting in ucds less massive and less extended than the initial nucleus requires many ( more than 5 ) pericentre passages with distances less than 5 kpc .",
    "we consider such orbits with many close pericentre passages unlikely since a small perturbation could increase the pericentre distance . as",
    "the typical ucd size is 2 - 3 times the initial nucleus size , ucds formed from such massive nuclei would likely have sizes of @xmath89 pc and luminosities of @xmath91 . since the host galaxies of the most massive nuclei are lenticular ( s0 ) or elliptical galaxies , and therefore more massive than des , the number of close pericentre passages required to tidally strip the galaxy is likely much larger .",
    "the extreme orbits required for formation , and the rarity of objects with such massive nuclei , may explain the lack of objects in this region .",
    "an extremely massive nucleus with @xmath92 would most likely resemble a compact elliptical galaxy , rather than a ucd , after tidal stripping .",
    "two questions that remain unanswered are whether orbits with only one to two close passages required for extended ucd formation occur in real galaxy clusters , and whether dwarf galaxies are destroyed in sufficient numbers to explain all ucds . for the first question a possible scenario in which such orbits may occur is if the first few passages of a dwarf galaxy in a galaxy cluster are highly radial , due to infall on low - angular momentum orbits , after which the pericentre increases due to a triaxial potential or interactions with other galaxies .",
    "a detailed answer to the first question , however , requires following the orbits of dwarf galaxies in cosmological simulations and we defer this , along with more accurate predictions of ucd numbers and spatial distributions , to a future paper .    for the second question",
    ", there already exists some previous work constraining the number of possible progenitor galaxies for ucds .",
    "@xcite compared the specific frequencies of gcs and ucds around various clusters and found no more than 50 per cent of ucds may be formed by tidal stripping ( based on the error bars of the specific frequencies derived for gcs ) . in the central @xmath82 - 70 kpc of the galaxy clusters they find @xmath93 per cent of possible progenitor dwarfs",
    "need to be disrupted to account for half of the ucds . as tidal",
    "stripping will be most efficient near the centre of a galaxy cluster we consider it entirely possible that such a high fraction of dwarfs in this region have been tidally disrupted .    to date",
    "there have been 34 ucds discovered in m87 , with possibly more than 50 still undiscovered out to a distance of 200 kpc @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we assume 50 per cent of the ucds , @xmath10 , to be formed by tidal stripping .",
    "according to the catalogue of @xcite , about 50 des are located within a projected distance of 200 kpc from the centre of m87 @xcite .",
    "given approximately 70 per cent of des are nucleated @xcite , this leaves 35 de , ns to be possible ucd progenitors .",
    "therefore , approximately @xmath94 per cent of possible ucd progenitor galaxies within 200 kpc of m87 need to be tidally stripped to account for half of the ucds .",
    "it is possible that observations are consistent with a population in which all dwarf galaxies are nucleated @xcite , which would lower the fraction needed to be stripped by 10 per cent .",
    "this estimate is consistent with calculations from cosmological simulations which suggest half of satellite galaxies get disrupted and/or accreted to their host halos @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could obtain an estimate of accreted dwarf galaxy numbers by looking at the globular cluster systems of elliptical galaxies .",
    "giant elliptical galaxies contain very rich gc systems which are almost universally bimodal in the colour distributions due to differences in metallicity @xcite .",
    "dwarf elliptical galaxies on the other hand contain gc systems which are predominantly metal - poor @xcite .",
    "one explanation for this bimodallity of giant elliptical gcs is that the metal - rich gcs are the intrinsic gc population of the galaxy , or were formed in starbursts triggered by gas - rich mergers , while the metal - poor gcs are provided by accretion of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "this explanation is strengthened by current theories of giant elliptical formation where the dominant growth mechanism for the galaxies from @xmath95 to @xmath96 is accretion through minor mergers @xcite .",
    "two previous studies have investigated the build - up of the gc systems of giant ellipticals via accretion of galaxies : @xcite for ngc 4472 , and @xcite for ngc 1399 , although using slightly different methods .",
    "these techniques provide a useful way to study the accretion of dwarf galaxies by giant ellipticals , however such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a common origin of accretion and tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies for ucds and blue gcs in giant ellipticals also places a constraint on the spatial distribution of ucds .",
    "if this scenario is correct , due to their common origin , we expect ucds far from the centre of m87 to have a similar spatial distribution as the blue gcs",
    ". however at small distances ucds should be underrepresented compared to gcs due to the ongoing tidal stripping converting ucds into gc - like objects .",
    "some evidence for a more extended distribution of ucds compared to gcs in the inner regions of galaxy clusters has been found @xcite , in agreement with our expectations .    in summary , we have demonstrated that the extended , low mass ucds found by @xcite can be formed in the tidal stripping scenario providing the dwarf galaxies have one or two pericentre passages with distances less than 10 kpc . given the observed range of de nuclei sizes and luminosities , the full range of ucd sizes can be produced within the tidal stripping scenario .",
