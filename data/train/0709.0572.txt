    "magnetic reconnection is the key process in conversion of the magnetic field energy into particle kinetic energy .",
    "it is well accepted that it plays a crucial role in the earth s magnetotail , solar flares and accretion discs ( priest & forbes 2000 , drake et al .",
    "2005 , pritchett 2006 ) .",
    "the relativistic reconnection in electron - positron plasmas is proposed for high energy astrophysical phenomena including the jets from active galactic nuclei ( lesch & birk 1998 , larrabee et al .",
    "2003 , wardle et al .",
    "1998 ) , pulsar winds ( coroniti 1990 , michel 1994 , lyubarsky & kirk 2001 ) and models of gamma - ray bursts ( drenkhahn 2002a , b ) . the relativistic reconnection and particle acceleration in pair plasmas was studied numerically for the first time by zenitani & hoshino ( 2001 , 2005 ) .",
    "the effectiveness of such an acceleration and corresponding synchrotron spectra has been computed in detail in the paper by jaroschek et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) .",
    "bessho & bhattacharjee ( 2005 ) have shown that this fast reconnection is caused by the off - diagonal components of the pressure tensor .",
    "recently , the rhessi observations of the solar flare on 2002 july 23 have revealed a separation of the gamma - ray source from any of those observed in the hard x - ray emission .",
    "it has been interpreted as a spatial separation of energetic electrons and protons ( share et al .",
    "based on the analytical and test particle approach zharkova & gordovskyy ( 2004 ) have explained this separation by the asymmetry in acceleration of electrons and protons in the reconnecting non - neutral current sheet , see also the papers by martens & young ( 1990 ) , zhu & parks ( 1993 ) , litvinenko ( 1996 ) .",
    "this separation acceleration can be even more distinct in pair plasmas due to the same mass of electrons and positrons .",
    "therefore in this paper using the particle - in - cell modelling we study this process in the electron - positron plasma in detail .",
    "we used a 2.5-d ( 2d3v  2 spatial and 3 velocity components ) fully relativistic electromagnetic particle - in - cell code ( saito & sakai 2004 ) .",
    "the system size is @xmath1 = 2000@xmath2 @xmath3 600@xmath2 = 200@xmath4 @xmath3 60@xmath5 , where @xmath2 ( = 1 ) is a grid size , @xmath4 = @xmath6 is the electron inertial length , @xmath7 is the speed of light and @xmath8 is the plasma frequency .",
    "two 2-d current sheets with the guiding magnetic field b@xmath9 are initiated along the lines @xmath10",
    "= 150@xmath2 and @xmath10 = 450@xmath2 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "the half - width of both the current sheets is 10@xmath2 = @xmath4 .",
    "the initial magnetic field is ( see also karlick & brta 2007 ) @xmath11    we consider the electron - positron plasma . in each numerical cell located out of the current sheet we initiated n@xmath12 = 60 electrons and n@xmath12 = 60 positrons . in this region out of the current sheet we define the plasma frequency for the time unit @xmath13 .",
    "the time step in computations is @xmath14 = 0.05 .",
    "the total amount of particles in the model is 172 millions .",
    "the initial number density is enhanced in the current sheets just to keep the pressure equilibrium in the current sheet .",

    "the mean initial thermal energy of electrons and positrons is taken the same as 0.45 @xmath22 .",
    "we neglect any collisions , pair production , and pair annihilation of pair plasmas .    due to our interest about",
    "the reconnection processes in the relativistic plasma with high magnetic field we consider cases with low-@xmath23 plasmas .",
    "the plasma beta parameter and the ratio of the electron - cyclotron and electron - plasma frequencies in the region out of the current sheets are chosen as @xmath23=0.11 , @xmath24 = 4 ( case i ) and @xmath23=0.5 , @xmath24 = 1.9 ( case ii ) . for comparison",
    "one run was made for the parameters as in case i , but without the guiding magnetic field , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore the same processes are modelled in the electron - proton plasma ( case iii ) with the proton - electron mass ratio @xmath0 = 16 .",
    "the proton and electron temperature is taken the same @xmath26 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath23 = 0.11 and @xmath24 = 4 .",
    "the mean initial thermal energy is 0.45 @xmath22 .",
    "all computations were performed on the parallel computer ocas ( ondejov cluster for astrophysical simulations ) , see http://wave.asu.cas.cz/ocas .",
    "due to the tearing mode instability the current sheet tears into o - type islands ( plasmoids ) which later on coalesce into larger ones . during these processes",
    "both the electrons and positrons are accelerated .",
    "figure 1 shows an evolution of the electron distribution function @xmath27 ( for case i ) in dependence on the energy @xmath28 in the whole numerical plane ( upper part of figure 1 ) as well as in one selected location ( bottom part of figure 1 , for the location see figure 4 ) , where much harder spectrum can be seen . while the spectral index at @xmath29 = 600 in the whole plane is -3.3 , in the selected location is about -1.9 .",
    "there are other such places , especially at the locations where high - energy electrons and positrons are produced , see figure 4 .",
    "this acceleration process is very efficient and looks to have a 2-step character in time as shown in figure 2 , where an evolution of the number of accelerated electrons in the ratio to the total number of electrons ( in percents ) with the energy @xmath30 4 is shown .",
    "an analysis shows that the first step of the acceleration ( up to about @xmath29 = 400 ) is connected with tearing processes and in the second step ( after @xmath29 = 400 ) the main process is the coalescence of plasmoids .",
    "the acceleration with the higher value of @xmath24 = 4 ( full line ) ( case i ) is more efficient than that with @xmath24 = 1.9 ( dashed line ) ( case ii ) ( figure 2 ) .",
    "similarly as in previous studies ( drake et al . 2005 , pritchett 2006 , jaroschek et al .",
    "2004a , b ) the electrons and positrons are accelerated in the electric field near the x - points formed during the tearing and coalescence processes .",
    "but we found that during this acceleration process ( figures 3 and 4 ) the electrons and positrons are moving into different locations around the o - type magnetic structures ( plasmoids ) and thus they are spatially separated ( e.g. see the region around @xmath31 = 500@xmath2 and @xmath10 = 450@xmath2 in figure 4 ) . to understand this separation process we analyzed the electric field near the x - point of the reconnection ( figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "as seen here the electrons ( the asterisks ) are located at the borders of the areas with the enhanced ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the positrons are located along the remaining two borders ( see figure 3 , bottom part ) .",
    "the electric component @xmath36 along the line @xmath10 = 150@xmath2 is negative between the o - type magnetic structures ( figure 6 ) .",
    "but only near the x - point of the reconnection this electric field ( @xmath36 ) deviates from that of the inductive one @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the plasma velocity ) , see figure 7 , where their profiles are shown at two times ( @xmath29 = 50 and 100 ) .",
    "this deviation defines the diffusion region of the reconnection . as concerns the magnetic field in the early stage of the reconnection ,",
    "the magnetic field component @xmath39 is positive in the region @xmath40 1000@xmath2 and negative for @xmath41 1000@xmath2 .",
    "the structure of the magnetic field together with the plasma velocity pattern in the regions from the x - point to the magnetic island centers resembles to that of the collapsing magnetic trap ( giuliani et al .",
    "2005 ; karlick & brta 2006 ) .",
    "in such a structure the particles are also accelerated , but not separated as found here near the x - points .",
    "this additional acceleration process is known as that in the contracting magnetic islands ( drake et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "furthermore , we made the similar computations , but without the guiding magnetic field component ( @xmath42 ) . in this case no separation of electrons and positrons was found .",
    "also the electric field structure was different from that presented in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "finally , we made similar computations also for the electron-``proton '' plasma , with the electron - proton ratio @xmath0 = 16 ( case iii ) .",
    "similarly as in the previous cases , figure 8 shows that accelerated electrons and protons move to different positions . comparing this case iii ( dotted line in figure 2 ) with case i ( full line )",
    "the number of accelerated electrons is reduced .",
    "the present simulations show that the magnetic reconnection with the guiding magnetic field accelerate electrons to different positions around the plasmoid than for positrons or `` protons '' .",
    "if the magnetic field connectivity ( in the @xmath43-direction ) from the upper and bottom part of the plasmoid differs then the accelerated electrons and positrons ( or protons ) move into quite different locations as observed by rhessi .",
    "the separation of particles with different electric charge is a natural consequence of the acceleration in direct electric field near the x - points of the magnetic field reconnection .    in agreement with litvinenko ( 1996 ) and",
    "zharkova & gordovskyy ( 2004 ) we found that the separation process is due to a presence of the non - zero guiding magnetic field ( non - neutral current sheet ) .",
    "namely , our simulations with the zero guiding magnetic field show no such separations .",
    "zharkova & gordovskyy ( 2004 ) have shown that the separation direction ( in the present designation of the electric and magnetic field components ) depends on the sign of the term @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the electron ( -e ) or positron ( + e ) charge ( see the relation ( 8) in their paper )",
    ". considering the direction of the magnetic and electric fields in our case ( figures 5 and 6 ) it can be shown the separation direction found agrees to this relation .",
    "this result agrees also to the relations presented in the paper by litvinenko ( 1996 ) .",
    "the similar separation process is found also for the reconnection in the `` proton''-electron plasma with the proton - electron mass ratio @xmath0 = 16 .",
    "this mass ratio is not realistic and is taken due to computer limitations .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that such a separation process will be confirmed by future computations also for the real proton - electron mass ratio .",
    "comparing the acceleration process for the electron - positron ( full line ) and electron - proton ( @xmath0=16 , dotted line ) plasma in figure 2 , we found that n@xmath46/n@xmath47 is 1.18 , i.e. the number of accelerated electrons n depends on the proton - electron mass ratio as n@xmath48/n@xmath49 @xmath50 1/(@xmath0)@xmath51 .",
    "if this relation is valid also for the real proton - electron mass ratio then we can write n@xmath48/n@xmath52 = 1.6 , which gives enough accelerated electrons also for the real electron - proton plasma .",
    "comparing the present modelling with previous studies the most similar simulation is that of zenitani & hoshino ( 2001 ) , especially due to initial high thermal plasma energy .",
    "but in their model no guiding magnetic field , which is crucial for the particle separation , is considered .",
    "furthermore , contrary to our start from noise level they initiate the reconnection by magnetic field perturbation which can influence the separation process , too .",
    "the maximum energies of accelerated electrons in both models are comparable .",
    "but in our model the reconnection process is about three times slower than that in zenitani & hoshino ( 2001 ) .",
    "we think that it is due to the initial magnetic field perturbation .",
    "although the acceleration in the contracting magnetic islands does not separate particles of opposite electric charges this process is important for global acceleration . but this process is even more complicated than presented in the paper by drake et al .",
    "namely , not only parallel energy of particles increases due to reflection from the ends of contracting magnetic islands ( as described by the relation ( 1 ) in drake et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) but also the perpendicular energy of particles @xmath53 can increase due to the betatron type of the acceleration , which follows from the conservation of the magnetic moment @xmath54 in the region with the increasing magnetic field @xmath55 ( see karlick & brta 2006 ) . in our simulations the contracting acceleration is time varying , therefore let us compare its efficiency with that of the acceleration near the x - point at one specific time . using the relation ( 1 ) of drake et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we derived the electric field equivalent to this process as @xmath56 = ( v@xmath57 b@xmath58 v m@xmath59)/(@xmath60 e b@xmath61 ) , where 2@xmath60 is the length of the island , @xmath62 and @xmath55 are the reconnecting and total magnetic fields , @xmath63 is the contracting velocity , @xmath17 is the mean electron velocity , and @xmath64 is the electron mass .",
    "for the parameters in case i at @xmath29 = 100 it gives the equivalent electric field in the contracting magnetic island @xmath56 one order of magnitude lower than the electric field @xmath36 at the x - point region .",
    "it means that at this moment the acceleration near the x - point dominates over that in the contracting magnetic islands .",
