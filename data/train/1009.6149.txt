    "bianchi et al . ( 2009a , b ) presented the catalogue of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the _ xmm - newton _ archive ( caixa ) .",
    "they focused on the radio - quiet , x - ray unobscured ( nh @xmath0 @xmath1 ) agn observed by xmm - newton in targeted observations .",
    "we are carrying out a similar multiwavelength study , for both targeted and field radio - loud agn observed by _",
    "xmm newton_. we cross - correlated the vern - cetty & vern ( 2010 ) catalogue ( quasars and active galactic nuclei , 13th edition ) with the _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalogue ( 2xmmi , watson et al . , 2009 ) third data release , and obtained a list of around 4000 sources .",
    "however , only 10% of the sources have published optical and radio data .",
    "our sample consists of all agn ( 403 total , figures [ loudquiet ] and [ lxlb ] ) with available x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) , optical ( b - band ) and radio ( 5 ghz ) data .",
    "erg / s / hz radio loud ( green ) agn are brighter in x - rays than radio quiet ( red and blue ) .",
    "this effect is stronger at higher luminosities ( 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 erg / s / hz ) , where radio loud agn deviate from the low luminosities correlation .",
    "x - ray emission in radio loud sources could have larger contributions from the jet.,width=326 ]",
    "radio loud sources show jet contribution to optical and x - ray emission , and are brighter in x - rays than radio quiet .",
    "optical and x - rays are agn dominated with small contribution from host . for optical luminosities higher than 10@xmath4 erg / s / hz",
    "radio loud agn are brighter in x - rays than radio quiet .",
    "this effect increases for higher luminosities ( @xmath5 ) , where loud agn deviate from the low luminosities correlation .",
    "x - rays in radio loud sources could have higher contributions from the jet .",
    "the sample seems to be missing faint , radio loud agn , although at this point it is not clear if this is due to selection or astrophysical effects .",
    "while x - rays in radio loud agn seem to come mainly from jets , other mechanisms of x - ray emission are being studied ( e.g. adaf ) ?",
    "a complete spectral optical and x - ray analysis , including also the 0.2 - 2 kev band will bring light to the origin of the x - rays in these sources .",
    "we are currently studying the sample properties according to different classifications ( seyfert and qso or fr i and fr ii morphologies ) , and will include ir data when available , with the goal of carrying out a systematic analysis in as many wavelengths as possible ."
