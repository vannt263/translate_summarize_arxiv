    "a recent experiment @xcite is consistent with the formation of the nucleus @xmath2118 and its sequential decay down to @xmath3sg ( z  =  106 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-decay energies vary rather smoothly along the chain , precluding the traditional macroscopic - microscopic @xcite z  =  114 as a major magic proton number in these nuclei .",
    "recent phenomenological studies of b(e2 ) @xcite and wigner term @xcite systematics indicate z  =  126 as a plausible next spherical proton magic number after lead .",
    "recent self - consistent and relativistic mean field calculations @xcite variously predict proton magicities for z = 114 , 120 , 124 and 126 , depending on the interaction used .",
    "contrary to most of the above findings , the semiempirical shell model mass equation ( ssme ) @xcite is based on the assumption that z = 114 is the next proton magic number after lead , and it stops there . moreover , the quality of its agreement with the data starts deteriorating already beyond hs ( z = 108 ) .",
    "( see fig . 1 , and fig .",
    "one has to find a substitute for the equation in the neighbourhood of z  =  114 and beyond .    in the early stages of developing the ssme @xcite both z  =  114 and z  =  126 ,",
    "then considered possible alternative candidates for the postlead proton magic number , were tried as an upper shell - boundary for translead elements .",
    "the agreement with the data was about the same for both choices , and considering the prevailing view in the mid nineteen - seventies z = 114 was chosen for the ssme mass table .",
    "we have recently @xcite established a high predictive power of the early z = 126 results in the interior of the shell region with z  @xmath5  82 and 126 @xmath6 n @xmath6 184 ( called here region b ) by comparing them to the newer data measured since then , and proposed using them as a substitute for the ssme @xcite in superheavy elements ( she ) research .",
    "we have also @xcite established a high predictive power for @xmath7 values of the early z  =  126 results in the interior of the shell region with 82  @xmath6  z , n  @xmath6  126 ( called region a ) .",
    "however , the quality of the predicted masses and other mass differences worsened much compared to that of the original adjustment .",
    "therefore we readjusted the coefficients which largely cancel in @xmath7 , and proposed using the resulting equation as a substitute for the ssme @xcite in the interior of region a.    in sect .",

    "the deviations of the seven n = 126 - 128 nuclei , denoted by empty circles in the figure , increase when z increases along the common boundary of regions a and b away from the data .",
