    "the ngc  128 group ( d=57  mpc ) includes ( spectroscopically confirmed ) : giant gas - rich s0 ngc  128 with a peanut - shaped bulge , giant sa ngc  125 , 3 low - luminosity s0 closer than 100  kpc in projection to ngc  128 : ngc  126 ( m@xmath0=-18.5 , 61 kpc ) , ngc  127 ( m@xmath0=-18.6 , 14 kpc ) , and ngc  130 ( m@xmath0=-19.0 , 16 kpc ) , and several late - type spirals beyond 300  kpc .",
    "ngc  128 is known to have a gaseous disc counter - rotating to the stars ( emsellem & arsenault , 1997 ) .",
    "we have obtained observations for ngc  126 , 127 , and 130 in 2005 and 2006 with the mpfs ifu spectrograph at the 6-m telescope of sao ras . using a novel stellar population fitting technique ( chilingarian et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007a , prugniel et al .",
    "2005 ) we have derived maps of the stellar population parameters ( age and metallicity ) and internal kinematics of stars and ionised gas .",
    "* ngc  126 * contains a prominent bar seen on direct images .",
    "it appears as a s - shaped structure on the velocity field .",
    "no emission lines are seen in the fitting residuals . * ngc  127 * is a gas - rich object with early - type morphology and ongoing star formation : strong emission lines are observed .",
    "h@xmath1 has been used to recover velocity field of the ionised gas showing faster rotation ( @xmath2100 km / s ) than stars ( @xmath250 km / s ) , and asymmetry on the se part of ngc  127 ( direction of ngc  128 ) that may be caused by perturbed motions of the gas near the region , where the accreting flow reaches ngc  127 .",
    "* ngc  130 * located at nearly the same projected distance is very different .",
    "relatively old stellar population , regular kinematics and absence of ionised gas suggest it is located much further from ngc  128 .",
    "ngc  130 exhibits a spatially unresolved young nucleus ( @xmath3t=4 gyr ) reminiscent of young central structures observed in bright virgo cluster de galaxies ( chilingarian et al .",
    "2007b ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "while ngc  126 and 130 look similar to cluster ds0/s0 s , ngc  127 is a star - forming galaxy with unusual kinematics of gas and a bridge connecting it to ngc  128 .",
    "we propose the following scenario : ngc  127 has recently passed its pericentre , and now we observe an infall of gas from ngc  128 onto ngc  127 .",
    "after gas removal and several gyr of passive evolution it will fade down and would be indistinctive from  normal  de galaxies by morphology and luminosity .",
