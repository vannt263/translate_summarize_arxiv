    "gbur @xcite provides a comprehensive recent review of this topic and the reader is referred to this review for more detailed historical context . of the earlier work",
    "the following contributions are particularly relevent for the discussion here : schott @xcite gave the condition for non - radiation of a spherical shell on a circular orbit .",
    "bohm and weinberg @xcite extended this result to more general spherical charge distributions and goedecke @xcite showed how an asymmetrical charge distribution with spin is non - radiating .",
    "all of these works are concerned with the case of spatially moving sources .",
    "finally it is noteworthy , that non - radiating sources play an important role in inverse problems and have been investigated in a one - dimensional electrodynamic situation by habashy , chow and dudley @xcite .    in this paper",
    "our purpose is to describe this phenomena in the case of a lattice string in one dimensions by discretizing dalembert s solution .",
    "this approach is used extensively to simulate vibrating strings and air tubes of musical instruments .",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this leads to explicit dynamical constructions of previously reported non - propagating excitations .",
    "its simplicity allows for additional insight into the mechanism that allows for the local confinements and the conditions under which they occur .",
    "i will show how the basic mechanisms that provide a time - harmonic stationary non - propagating excitation in one dimension as studied by berry _",
    "et al . _ and gbur _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite allows for a much wider class of excitations .",
    "for instance can such an excitation be relieved from the time - harmonic assumption beyond one period allowing for non - propagating sources that are short - lived .",
    "directional excitations can easily be achieved using very simple bidirectional excitation patterns .",
    "these are explicit constructions of such waves in one spatial dimension whose general condition of existence in the three - dimensional case has been derived by marengo , devaney and ziolkowski @xcite .",
    "wave propagation can be virtually slowed down .",
    "in general i will show that non - propagating excitations can be extended to steered excitation regions with basic physical restrictions imposed by the underlying field dynamics .",
    "first i will give a quick derivation of the simple lattice model from the wave equation as can also be found in @xcite",
    ". then i will give a new argument and construction of the berry _ et al .",
    "_ type non - propagating excitation purely based on discrete string dynamics .",
    "this will then be compared to the original approach .",
    "then i will extend the discussion to examples of additional types of non - propagating waves , including directional and slowed waves .",
    "finally i will discuss very general constraints on such `` steered '' localized excitations .",
    "the lattice string model can easily be derived from the wave - equation by discretizing the dalembert solution .",
    "hence the continuous case will be discussed first .",
    "the one - dimensional homogeneous wave equation of the perfectly elastic string under tension is :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is derived from mass density @xmath4 and tension @xmath5 .",
    "the dalembert solution of the homogeneous `` free field '' case has the well known form ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 4 ) ) :    @xmath6    hence the solution of the general of the homogeneous wave - equation are two propagating waves whose content is restricted by initial and boundary conditions . as wave - equation",
    "is linear we have a connection between initial conditions and external driving forces .",
    "driving forces can be seen as infinitesimal time frames that act on the wave dynamics by imposing a new initial condition at each point in time .",
    "hence we need to consider the initial value problem to gain insight into both processes at once .    at a given time frame @xmath7",
    "let the following initial conditions hold :    @xmath8    equation ( [ eq : in1 ] ) with ( [ eq : we ] ) gives a particular solution @xmath9 :    @xmath10    taking the first temporal derivative of ( [ eq : we ] ) and satisfying equation ( [ eq : in2 ] ) we get :    @xmath11    integrating with respect to @xmath12 we get ( * ? ? ?",

( 10 ) p. 596 ) :    @xmath13    from equations ( [ eq : satin1 ] ) and ( [ eq : satin2 ] ) we can solve for the traveling wave components :    @xmath14    we see that forced displacement @xmath15 splits evenly between left and right traveling waves and the integrated forced velocity @xmath16 splits with a sign inversion .    for",
    "our current discussion i will share the assumption of no initial velocity of berry _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and hence the integral over @xmath16 will vanish .    for the infinite string this is already the complete solution for any twice differentiable function of free solutions and external forced displacements .",
    "to arrive at lattice equations we discretize the solution of the wave - equation ( [ eq : we ] ) in time via the substitution @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the discrete time - step and @xmath19 is the discrete time index .",
    "this automatically corresponds to a discretization in space as well , because in finite time @xmath18 a wave will travel @xmath20 distance according to ( [ eq : we ] ) .",
    "the spatial index will be called @xmath21 .",
    "the free - field discrete dalembert solution :    @xmath22    in general we can always express all discrete equations in terms of finite time steps or finite spatial lengths .",
    "we chose a temporal expression and substitute @xmath20 and suppress shared terms in @xmath23 to arrive at the index version of the discrete dalembert solution @xcite :    @xmath24    by equations ( [ eq : force1 ] ) and ( [ eq : force2 ] ) we see that at an instance @xmath25 the discrete contribution of external forced displacements splits evenly between the traveling waves and we arrive at the discrete field equations including external forced displacements :    @xmath26",
    "next we will construct the non - propagating excitation from the lattice string dynamics directly .    for simplicity and without loss of generality , we will assume a region aligning with the discretization domain throughout .",
    "we want to construct an excitation which is confined to a length @xmath27 .",
    "for now we will assume that the string should otherwise stay at rest .",
    "this implies that there are no incoming waves into the region @xmath28 $ ] from the outside .",
    "we are interested in a non - trivial excitation within the region .",
    "first we consider the contributions to the position @xmath29 . as there are no incoming external waves we get :    @xmath30    we do expect non - trivial wave @xmath31 to reach the boundary but we require the total outgoing wave to vanish we have :    @xmath32    the necessary external forced displacement contribution to for cancellation needs to be :    @xmath33    the complete incoming wave ( [ eq : fullwg1 ] ) will see the same forced contribution ( [ eq : forceeq ] ) and with equation ( [ eq : noin ] ) we get :    @xmath34    hence the matched forced displacement leads to a reflection with sign inversion at the region boundary at @xmath29 .",
    "following the same line of argument at point @xmath35 we get the related condition :    @xmath36    with these two conditions we can study the permissible form of excitations .",
    "first we assume an initial forced displacement impulse from a position @xmath37 in the interior of the domain @xmath38 .",
    "hence @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41",
    ".    it will take half the impulse @xmath42 steps to reach the left boundary and the other half @xmath43 steps to reach the right one .    at each boundary",
    "the respective condition ( [ eq : cond1],[eq : cond2 ] ) needs to be satisfied and we get :    @xmath44    the impulse will then reflect back and create periodic matching conditions .    @xmath45    with @xmath46 .",
    "hence we see that a single impulse will necessitate an infinite periodic series of forced external displacements at the boundaries to trap the impulse inside as each `` annihilation '' of a half - pulse reaching the boundary leads to a `` creation '' of a reflected one .    the required impulse response of a boundary forced function @xmath47",
    "can easily be observed from equations ( [ eq : boundf1][eq : boundf4 ] ) to be spatially periodic in @xmath48 with an initial phase factor dictated by the starting position @xmath37 .",
    "additionally the functional shape of the impulse responses @xmath47 is completely defined for all time steps as @xmath49 for all times that equations ( [ eq : boundf1][eq : boundf4 ] ) do nt apply .    a condition for stopping a non - propagating excitation can be derived from the fact that a impulse will return to its initial position every @xmath48 time steps . additionally it is easy to see that the traveling impulses will occupy the same spatial position every odd multiple of @xmath50 with a sign inversion .",
    "hence an impulsive forced displacement @xmath51 with @xmath52 will cancel an initial impulse @xmath40 . from this",
    "we can immediately deduce the following property :    the shortest possible single impulse finite non - propagating excitation takes @xmath50 time - steps.[th : shortest ]    and more generally :    the time of any single impulse excitation finite non - propagating excitation has to be @xmath53 .",
    "more importantly we observe the property : _ non - propagating excitations can be finite in duration_.    this is an extension beyond berry _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which assumes infinitely periodic temporal progressions in their derivations .",
    "the general solution for discrete non - propagating wave functions can be derived by observing that any initial `` phase '' @xmath54 is orthogonal to other phases @xmath55 for @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 for @xmath58 . within a @xmath50 period @xmath59",
    "is well - defined by @xmath60 .",
    "interestingly though this provides the only restriction to the forced boundary functions .",
    "this can be seen by theorem [ th : shortest ] .",
    "after @xmath50 each @xmath54 will find constructive interference and can be annihilated or rescaled to an arbitrary other value @xmath61 .",
    "hence any arbitrary succession of @xmath62 force distributions with a @xmath50 termination is permissible .",
    "hence periodicity is not necessary .",
    "the time harmonic case can be derived if the initial force distribution within the domain is not modified over time .",
    "then a configuration will repeat after traveling left and right , being reflected at the domain boundary twice , traversing the length of the region twice .",
    "hence the lowest permissible wave - length is @xmath48 . by reflecting twice the wave will have gone through a @xmath63 phase shift , but we note that the periodicity condition is also satisfied if any number of additional @xmath63 shifts have been accumulated . hence we get for permissible wave - numbers :    @xmath64    or    @xmath65    by allowing only even @xmath19 we get the berry _ at al . _ condition @xcite for an even square distribution .",
    "the odd @xmath19 situation corresponds to the odd - harmonic out - of - phase construction proposed by denardo @xcite .",
    "many of these properties can be seen visually in the numerical simulation depicted in figure [ fig : nonprop ] .",
    "it is interesting to observe that two synchronous point - sources oscillating with the above phase condition will not be completely non - propagating",
    ". they will only be non - propagating after waves created at the wave onset have escaped .",
    "this is a refinement of the argument put forward by denardo @xcite and can intuitively be described as _ non - interference of the first trap period_. hence the first pairs of pulses will have half - amplitude components escaping in either direction but every subsequent period will be trapped .",
    "this behavior , which could be called imperfect trapping or trapping with transient radiation , is depicted in figure [ fig : pointpair ] .",
    "sources presented by berry _ et al .",
    "_ and denardo @xcite do not display this behavior because the force is assumed to be oscillatory at all times and hence has no onset moment .",
    "non - propagating excitations can be used as generic building blocks for other unusual excitation induced behavior on the string .",
    "in particular i will next describe how to construct an uni - directional emitter , and a virtually slowed propagation .",
    "in fact a non - propagating excitation can be seen as virtually stopping a wave at a particular position .",
    "a one - sided open trap immediately suggests another unusual excitation type , namely the directional excitation . the string is to be excited in such a way that a traveling wave in only one direction results .",
    "we start with a one - sided open trap .",
    "this is a trap that uses a reflection condition ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) only on one side of an initial excitation .",
    "evidently the wave then can only travel in the opposite direction .",
    "for the discussion we will describe a right - sided propagator ( i.e. a propagator traveling with increasing negative index ) .",
    "the trapping condition then reads :    @xmath66    hence the trapping excitation point is a @xmath37 time - step lagging negative copy of the original excitation .",
    "the emitted wave will have the form    @xmath67    the emitting wave will show self - interference at a phase of @xmath68 time - steps , as can be seen in the simulation depicted in figure [ fig : onesided ] .",
    "in general the self - interference phase can be chosen by the distance @xmath37 between the wave creation point and the trapping point .",
    "it is worth noting that it is possible to eliminate interference by trapping the lagging contribution and hence create a wave non - interference directional wave left of the trapping region .",
    "virtual slow waves can be achieved by alternating directional wave propagation with trapping .",
    "the slowness of the wave propagation can be controlled by the number and and duration times of the traps along a propagation .",
    "the propagation characteristics of the dynamic operator has not changed at all , hence we call the this state `` virtually slow '' as opposed to the case where the field itself induces a change in wave propagation speed .",
    "this also means that within a slowed or `` steered '' region the wave propagation is the one prescribed by the dynamic operator @xmath69 on the string @xmath70 .",
    "the amount of time spend in traps determines the overall slowness .",
    "one example of slow wave consists of an immediate alteration between one stage of trapping and one step of one - sided propagation is illustrated in figure [ fig : slowwave ] .",
    "the effective propagation speed of the wave can easily be read from the diagram to give @xmath71 . as is evident from theorem [ th : shortest ]",
    ", a unit @xmath72 trap will last @xmath73 time - steps and will not propagate spatially and one step of free propagation will last one time - step and and make one spatial step , hence resulting in a spatial to temporal ratio of @xmath74 .",
    "the trapping relations are :    @xmath75    with @xmath76 .",
    "the generalized interpretation of the excitation interaction lead to the general dynamical confinement of waves by external excitation . for instance following very similar arguments as for virtual slow waves a construction is possible which gives a slowed `` cone of influence '' by successively widening the trap boundaries at a speed slower than the the wave speed @xmath77 . by this argument",
    "it is sufficient for the trap boundaries change to be less than @xmath77 for it to be trapping the wave .",
    "this is not a necessary condition by the following counter - example : let the trap width be @xmath35 and change rapidly by some slope @xmath78 to some new constant width @xmath79 at which it becomes constant .",
    "obviously the wave will then be able to reach the new boundary even though a local change of the boundary exceeded the dynamical speed @xmath77 .",
    "the necessary condition can be seen from our previous construction . at a trap boundary a wave",
    "is reflected and will propagate in the opposite direction of the domain following the linear characteristic @xmath77 .",
    "only if this characteristics intersects with the dynamic trapping boundary will there be another externally forced reflection as illustrated in figure [ fig : steering ] .",
    "these may in fact have regions where no trapping is necessary and possible .",
    "it is important to note that while we assumed that the incoming wave vanishes , see equation ( [ eq : noin ] ) , the outgoing wave condition ( [ eq : noout ] ) does not change if there is in fact an incoming wave .",
    "the `` reflection wave '' ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) can be rewritten for a non - zero incoming field without affecting the trapping :    @xmath80    and @xmath81    these conditions are `` absorbing '' in the sense that an external field entering the trapping region will not leave it .",
    "the `` non - interacting '' property of a trap defined by the periodic matching conditions ( [ eq : boundf1][eq : boundf4 ] ) can be seen by assuming a non - zero incoming wave at one point of the trap boundary @xmath82 .",
    "then the total wave entering the trapping region the sum of the wave created by the trapping condition and the incoming wave value @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the first trap boundary reached .",
    "when reaching the second trapping boundary @xmath85 the now outgoing wave will see a matching force @xmath86 leaving an outgoing wave contribution @xmath87 to escape the trapping region @xmath88 .    in order to achieve selective radiation , only part of the content of a trapped region",
    "are trapped at the boundary as can be achieved by using a reduced force at the trapping boundary or by selectively omitting certain phases in the trapping force pattern .",
    "marengo and ziolkowski @xcite present ideas very much related to ideas presented here and in berry _",
    ".    however , they arrive at a definition of non - radiating ( nr ) sources that is not obviously similar to the traps presented here .",
    "in particular they define nr sources as being non - interacting . while @xcite note that a central property of nr sources is that they store non - trivial field energy , traps described here can not only store , but accumulate and selectively radiate waves .",
    "the difference can be understood by observing that for example berry _",
    "_ assume a simple time - harmonic driver ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 3 ) ) throughout their discussion :    @xmath89    by our earlier discussion we see that the temporal progression of the boundary has to match the content of the interior domain .",
    "hence once the boundary is defined to be oscillatory the interior of the domain needs to be spatially harmonic as derived in @xcite and has been rederived here .",
    "hence a nr source as noted in literature , with exception of the general orthogonality formulation for time - varying sources given by marengo , devaney and ziolkowski @xcite , can be thought of as a time - oscillatory trap .",
    "the arguments made here use a formalism that is discrete in nature .",
    "however , the discreteness of the arguments are not necessarily restrictive .",
    "the continuous case can be imagined with the discrete time - step made small ( @xmath90 ) or alternatively , discrete pulses can be substituted with narrow distributions of compact support . in neither case",
    "are the results of interest derived here altered .    as has already been derived in @xcite",
    "the critical condition for non - propagating waves lie at the boundary of the domain - range that the wave ought not to leave . in the discrete case it is easy to see how this insight can be used and generalized .",
    "in fact , the boundaries of the confining domain need not be static , nor need the condition be used in a two - sided fashion .",
    "in summary , this paper presented constructions of a broad class of non - propagating sources on a string lattice model using trapping conditions .",
    "in particular this includes numerical demonstrations of finite - duration non - propagating excitations , directional excitations , as well as virtually slowed waves .",
    "these examples help explain the extension of non - propagating sources beyond the time - periodic case and include treatment of onset , annihilation and spatial steering .",
    "these properties ought to be observable in experiments well - described by the wave equation .",
    "this equation often arises in problems in acoustics , elasticity , optics and electromagneticsm . and",
    "hence the results presented here apply to these domains of application .",
    "while here i discussed the forward problem , these results also relate to the inverse problem of finding source contributions from the one - dimensional field state as occur for example in acoustical , optical and electromagnetic detection problems .",
    "i am grateful for reprints provided by bruce denardo and greg gbur , who also brought relevant references to my attention .",
    "i m also thankful for helpful comments and pointers to relevant literature by an anonymous referee ."
