    "the large variety of superconductors that are not explained by the classic bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory include the cuprates @xcite and iron pnictides @xcite with their ( very ) high transition temperatures ( @xmath0 s ) , but also the large family of low @xmath0 heavy fermion superconductors @xcite .",
    "these materials have in common that the dominance of electronic repulsions create an environment that is _ a priori _ very unfavorable for conventional superconductivity .",
    "their unconventional ( non-@xmath1-wave ) order parameters indeed signal that dissimilar physics is at work . based on a multitude of experiments",
    ", a widely held hypothesis has arisen that the physics of many of these systems is controlled by a quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "this would generate a scale invariant quantum physics in the electron system , as it does for any other second order phase transition , and the imprint of this universal critical behavior on the metallic state creates the conditions for unconventional superconductivity .",
    "we propose to test this hypothesis of quantum - criticality as the fundamental physics underlying the onset of superconductivity directly .",
    "a clean probe can be identified : a measurement of the dynamical order - parameter susceptibility  the cooper pair susceptibility  of the quantum critical superconductor in its normal state in a large temperature and energy interval .",
    "four differing theoretical views of electron - quantum - criticality that are available  including two brand new paradigms descending from string theory  all allow for explicit computations of the susceptibility @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the pair susceptibility can be measured directly via the so - called second order josephson effect in superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) junctions involving superconductors with different transition temperatures.@xcite    goldman and collaborators delivered proof of principle in the 1970s by measuring the pair susceptibility in the normal state of aluminum in an aluminum - aluminum oxide - lead junction @xcite . in this experiment the order parameter of the `` strong '' superconductor with a `` high '' @xmath2 acts as an external perturbing field on the metallic electron system realized above the transition of the superconductor with a much lower @xmath3 . in the temperature regime @xmath4 and for an applied bias @xmath5 less than the gap @xmath6 of the strong superconductor the current through a tunneling junction between the two is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the dynamical pair susceptibility .",
    "this higher order cooper pair tunneling process is a second order josephson effect : if at low temperatures the regular dc josephson effect can be observed ( i.e. , a finite supercurrent at zero bias in sis configuration ) , then the higher order tunneling cooper pair process is likely to occur in the superconductor - insulator - normal - state ( sin ) configuration at finite bias .",
    "quite recently bergeal et al .",
    "@xcite succeeded to get a signal on a 60 k underdoped cuprate superconductor using a 90 k cuprate source .",
    "this was motivated by the prediction that an asymmetric relaxational peak would be found signaling the dominance of phase fluctuations in the order parameter dynamics of the underdoped cuprate @xcite .",
    "although this prediction was not borne out by the experiment it is for the present purposes quite significant that bergeal et al . managed to isolate the second order josephson current at such a high temperature ( 60 k ) in @xmath7-wave superconductors where the masking effects of the quasiparticle currents should be particularly severe .",
    "as we will explain from our theoretical predictions , the unambiguous information regarding the quantum critical pairing mechanism resides in the large dynamical range in temperature and frequency of the pair susceptibility meaning that in principle one should measure up to temperatures of order @xmath8 and energies greater than ten times the gap of the weak superconductor ( we set @xmath9 from here on ) .",
    "the system that is interrogated should therefore be a quantum critical system with a low @xmath0 and the natural candidates are heavy fermion superconductors characterized by quantum critical points at ambient conditions .",
    "we shall propose two explicit experimental approaches using modern thin film techniques and stm / sts / pcs techniques with a superconducting tip to obtain the pair - susceptibility in the range of temperature and frequency that will distinguish between the differing quantum - critical metal models .",
    "theoretically the pair susceptibility is defined as @xmath10\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the cooper pair order parameter @xmath11 is built out of the usual annihilation ( creation ) operators for electrons @xmath12 with momentum @xmath13 and spin @xmath14 . in the @xmath1-channel @xmath15 .",
    "the imaginary ( absorptive ) part of this susceptibility at zero - momentum is measured by the second order josephon effect . in figure",
    "[ fig : expsignal ] we show the theoretical results for standard bcs theory compared to four different limiting scenarios for the quantum critical metallic state .",
    "this is our main result : the contrast is discernable by the naked eye and this motivates our claim that this is an excellent probe of the fundamental physics underlying the onset of superconductivity .",
    "we will make clear that the specific temperature evolution of the dynamical pair susceptibility directly reflects the distinct rg flows underlying the superconducting instability in each case .",
    "+      +     in detail the five types ( a - e ) of pairing mechanisms whose susceptibility is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : expsignal ] are :    case a is based upon traditional fermi liquid bcs theory and is included for comparison .",
    "the dynamical pair susceptibility is calculated through an eliashberg - type computation assuming a conventional fermi - liquid interacting with `` glue bosons '' in the form of a single - frequency oscillator @xcite .",
    "such a pair susceptibility would be found when the superconductivity would be due to `` superglue '' formed by bosons with a rather well defined energy scale as envisaged in some spin fluctuation scenarios @xcite .",
    "case b reflects the main stream thinking in condensed matter physics .",
    "it rests on the early work of hertz @xcite and asserts that the essence of bcs theory is still at work , i.e. , one can view the normal state at least in a perturbative sense as a fermi - liquid , which coexists with a bosonic order parameter field undergoing the quantum phase transition .",
    "the order parameter itself is landau damped by the particle - hole excitations , while the quantum critical fluctuations in turn couple strongly to the quasiparticles explaining the anomalous properties of the metallic state @xcite .",
    "eventually the critical bosons cause the attractive interactions driving the pairing instability @xcite .",
    "this notion is coincident with the idea that the pairing is due to spin fluctuations when the quantum phase transition involves magnetic order ( as in the heavy fermions and pnictides ) while in the cuprate community a debate rages at present concerning the role of other `` pseudogap '' orders like spontaneous currents and quantum nematics .",
    "the computation of the pair - susceptibility amounts to solving the full eliashberg equations for a glue function that itself is algebraic in frequency @xmath16 in the strong coupling regime as formulated by chubukov and coworkers @xcite . at first sight",
    "the resulting fig .",
    "[ fig : expsignal ] b looks similar to the remaining cases c - e that contain more radical assumptions regarding the influence of the quantum scale invariance .",
    "however , as we will see , case b should leave a strong fingerprint in the data in the form of a strong violation of energy - temperature scaling ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tempscaling]b ) .",
    "case c is a simple phenomenological `` quantum critical bcs '' scaling theory @xcite .",
    "it is like bcs in the sense that a simple pairing glue is invoked but now it is assumed that the normal state is a non - fermi liquid which is controlled by conformal invariance . in other words , the ` bare ' pair propagator @xmath17 , in the absence of glue ,",
    "is described by a scaling function .",
    "the full pair susceptibility is then given by the rpa expression @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the effective attractive interaction , that is non - retarded for simplicity .",
    "the pairing instability occurs when @xmath20 ' } = 0 $ ] . in quantum critical",
    "bcs one takes @xmath21 , valid when @xmath22 , as opposed to standard bcs where the bare fermion loop of the fermi - gas yields a `` marginal '' pair propagator @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "one can now deform the `` marginal '' fermi liquid bcs case @xmath24 to `` relevant '' pairing operators , i.e. , with scaling exponent @xmath25 .",
    "one effect of this power - law scaling is that @xmath0 becomes much larger .",
    "our full calculations include finite temperature effects which serves as an ir cut - off and incorporate a retarded nature of the interaction by considering an eliashberg - style generalization of equation  ( [ rpa ] ) .",
    "such power - law scaling behavior was recently identified in numerical dynamical cluster approximation calculations on the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "this was explained in terms of a marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) , i.e. the electron scattering rate proportional to the larger of temperature or frequency , in combination with a band structure characterized by a van hove singularity ( vhs ) which is precisely located at the fermi energy @xcite . the vhs is essential ; a mfl self - energy added to standard bcs or crtical glue alone will not produce the power - law scaling .",
    "the presence of a vhs can be measured independently by arpes @xcite and tunneling spectroscopy @xcite and therefore all the information is available in principle to distinguish this particular mechanism from the other cases . a careful study of the mfl pair susceptibility with both a smooth density of states and vhs is included in appendix b.    cases d and e are radical departures of established approaches to superconductivity that emerged very recently from string theory .",
    "they are based on the anti - de - sitter / conformal field theory correspondence ( ads / cft ) or `` holographic duality '' @xcite , asserting that the physics of extremely strongly interacting quantum critical matter can be encoded in quasi - classical gravitational physics in a space - time with one more dimension . including a charged black - hole in the center , a finite temperature and density is imposed in the field theory , and the fermionic response of the resulting state is remarkably suggestive of the strange - metal behavior seen experimentally in quantum critical metals .",
    "although the ( large-@xmath26 super - yang - mills ) field theories that ads / cft can explicitly address are remote to the physics of electrons in solids , there is much evidence suggesting that the correspondence describes generic `` scaling histories '' .",
    "ads / cft can be viewed as a generalization of the wilson - fisher renormalization group that handles deeply - non - classical many - particle entanglements , for which the structure of the renormalization flow is captured in the strongly constrained gravitational physics of the holographic dual . as such holography provides a new mechanism for superconductivity",
    ": it requires , gravitationally encoded in black hole superradiance , that the finite density quantum critical metal turns into a superconducting state when temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "this holographic superconductivity ( hs ) is `` without glue '' : hs is an automatism wired in the renormalization flow originating in the extreme thermodynamical instability of the uncondensed quantum critical metal at zero temperature . as we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : expsignal ] , ads / cft provides fundamentally new descriptions of the origin of superconductivity .",
    "the two cases d and e are the holographic analogues of local pair and `` bcs '' superconductors , in the sense that for the `` large charge '' case d the superconductivity sets in at a temperature of order of the chemical potential @xmath27 , while in the `` small charge '' case e the superconducting @xmath0 is tuned to a temperature that is small compared to @xmath27 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we propose two explicit experimental approaches to measure the imaginary part of the pairing susceptibility in the required temperature and frequency range .",
    "one approach invokes modern thin film techniques and the other uses stm / sts / pcs techniques with a superconducting tip .",
    "two heavy fermion systems , ceirin@xmath28 and @xmath29-ybalb@xmath30 , are suggested as candidate quantum critical superconductors . in section iii , we present details of the calculation of the pairing susceptibility in the five types of models ( a - e ) .",
    "for cases a - c , the full pair susceptibility is governed by the bethe - salpeter equation , with the bare ( electronic ) pair susceptibility and the pairing interaction ( glue ) as input . in the holographic approaches",
    "d and e , the pair susceptibility is calculated from the dynamics of the fluctuations of the dual scalar field in the ads black hole background in the dual gravity theory .",
    "the outcomes of these calculations are further analyzed in section iv .",
    "close to the superconducting transition point , all the five models display universal relaxational behavior .",
    "when moving away from t@xmath31 , one detects sharp qualitative differences between the truly conformal models ( cases c - e ) and the hertz - millis type models ( case b ) .",
    "we include in section v our conclusions .",
    "there are two appendix sections . in appendix",
    "a , the relaxational behavior of the holographic models is derived using the near - far matching technique . in appendix b",
    ", we present a hertz - millis type calculation of the pair susceptibility in a marginal fermi liquid .",
    "in order to experimentally observe @xmath32 via a second - order josephson effect , one should measure the pair tunneling current , @xmath33 .",
    "this can be accomplished via a planar tunnel junction or weak link between the higher temperature superconductor ( @xmath34 ) and the probe superconductor ( @xmath3 ) . to extract the pair tunneling current from the total tunneling current the quasiparticle tunneling current contribution",
    "must be subtracted , e.g. , by means of the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk @xcite formula and its ( @xmath7-wave ) generalizations . to minimize the masking effect of the quasiparticle current and to maximize the ranges of accessible reduced temperature and frequency the ratio @xmath35 of the two @xmath0 s should be as large as possible .",
    "perhaps the best candidate quantum critical superconductor is the heavy fermion system ceirin@xmath28 , since it appears to have a quantum critical normal state at ambient pressure , while its @xmath0 is a meager 0.4 k @xcite .",
    "the mixed valence compound @xmath29-ybalb@xmath30 , which displays quantum criticality up to about 3 k without any tuning and becomes superconducting below 80 mk @xcite , is another possible choice .",
    "the challenge is now to find a good insulating barrier that in turn is well connected to a `` high '' @xmath0 source superconductor .",
    "one option for the latter is the @xmath36 mgb@xmath37 system ; an added difficulty is that one should take care that this @xmath1-wave superconductor can form a josephson contact with the non - conventional ( presumably @xmath7-wave ) quantum critical superconductor .",
    "this has on the other hand the great advantage that the quasiparticle current is largely suppressed because of the presence of the full gap , compared to an unconventional source superconductor with its nodal quasiparticles . as a start",
    ", one could employ the modern material fabrication techniques of monolithic molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xcite and pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) @xcite , to form a junction between mgb@xmath37 and al with an insulating aluminum - oxide junction layer .",
    "reduced temperatures @xmath38 up to 40 with low noise @xmath39-values into the mv regime could be obtained with these two @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "a more challenging technique is to utilize the recent advances in scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) @xcite and point contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) @xcite to form or glue a tiny crystal or whisker of yba@xmath37cu@xmath40o@xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) to a normal ir or pt tip and tunnel or weakly contact the tip to the heavy fermion superconductor through its freshly cleaved surface . with the enormous spread in transition temperatures @xmath43-values of over 100",
    "could be reached within a mv low - noise region for two such @xmath7-wave superconductors .",
    "there are certainly difficulties with the cuprate superconductors such as surface charging , gap - reduction and low josephson currents .",
    "these troublesome issues could be resolved by using a pnictide superconductor tip @xcite or a combination of a hole - doped hts ( @xmath34 ) and concentration - tuned nd@xmath44ce@xmath45cuo@xmath46 ( @xmath47 k ) , an electron - doped superconductor , to increase the josephson current .",
    "stimulated by our pair - susceptibility calculations , we trust the challenged experimentalists will evaluate the above possibilities in their efforts towards novel thin film and tunneling spectroscopy investigations .",
    "the pair susceptibility is a true two - particle quantity , i.e. , it is derived from the full two - particle ( four point ) green s function which is traced over external fermion legs : let @xmath48 be the full four - point correlation function with incoming momenta / frequencies @xmath49 and outgoing momenta / frequencies @xmath50 , then the pair susceptibility @xmath51 . here momentum and frequency are grouped in a single symbol @xmath52 and we formulate equations using matsubara frequencies .",
    "the full pair susceptibility includes contributions from all forms of interactions .",
    "one commonly used approximation strategy is to separate it into two parts : an electronic part and a glue part .",
    "the glue is generally considered to be retarded in the sense that it has a characteristic energy scale @xmath53 that is small compared to the ultraviolet cut - off scale @xmath54 . under this retardation assumption ,",
    "i.e. , a small migdal parameter , the electron - glue vertex corrections can thus be ignored and the effects of the glue can be described by a bethe - salpeter - like equation in terms of the ` vertex ' operators @xmath55 , i.e. , a partial trace over @xmath48 .",
    "further simplification can be made by assuming that the pairing problem in quantum critical metals can still be treated within the eliashberg - type theory , with the electronic vertex operator @xmath56 and the glue propagator @xmath57 strongly frequency dependent , but without substantial momentum dependence .",
    "the glue part will only appear in the form of a frequency - dependent pairing interaction @xmath58 . the bethe - salpeter equation ( or dyson equation for the four point function ) then reads @xmath59 at @xmath60 .",
    "note that the pair susceptibility is a bosonic response , hence @xmath61 is a bosonic matsubara frequency whereas @xmath62 is fermionic . for given electronic part @xmath63 and glue part @xmath64 equation ( [ master ] ) can be solved , either by iteration or by direct matrix inversion .",
    "a further frequency summation over @xmath65 of @xmath66 finally yields the full pair susceptibility @xmath67 at imaginary frequency @xmath61 .",
    "the superconducting transition happens when the real part of the full pair susceptibility at @xmath68 diverges . to obtain the desired real - frequency dynamical pair susceptibility ,",
    "a crucial step is the analytic continuation , i.e. , the replacement @xmath69 .",
    "we choose the method of analytic continuation through pad approximants via matrix inversion @xcite , which performs remarkably well in our case , likely due to the fact that here the pair susceptibility is a very smooth function with only a single characteristic peak / feature .",
    "different models are characterized by different @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we will present the three non - holographic approaches to pairing , i.e. , cases a ",
    "c , in the remainder of this section .",
    "we consider a free fermi gas , interacting via a normal glue , say an einstein phonon , for which the pairing interaction is of the form @xmath70 for the fermi gas wick s theorem applies , and the electronic part of the pair susceptibility is simply the convolution of single - particle green s functions , @xmath71 if we ignore self - energy corrections we may substitute the free fermion green s function @xmath72 .",
    "the imaginary part of the bare pair susceptibility then has the simple form @xmath73 at @xmath74 . here the fermi energy acts as the ultraviolet cut - off , with @xmath75 .",
    "the electronic vertex operator reads @xmath76=\\frac{2 t}{\\omega_c}\\left|\\frac{\\theta(\\nu_n+\\omega)-\\theta(-\\nu_n ) } { 2\\nu_n+\\omega}\\right| , \\label{gamma0-bcs}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 the heaviside step function .",
    "a full eliashberg treatment includes self - energy corrections and modifies equation  ( [ gamma0-bcs ] ) to @xmath78 where @xmath79 . for small and non - singular pairing interaction @xmath64 the effect of the self - energy corrections will be minor .      in this subsection",
    ", we replicate one class of scenarios which attribute the novelty of unconventional superconductivity in such systems to the peculiar behavior of the glue when approaching the qcp .",
    "the glue part is assumed to become critical near the qcp , while the electronic part is kept a fermion bubble as in conventional bcs theory , equation  ( [ fermionloop ] ) , with self - energy corrections included .",
    "this class of scenarios are arguably best represented by the models introduced by chubukov and collaborators @xcite , where they assume that pairing is mediated by a gapless boson , and the pairing interaction is of the power - law form @xmath80 here the exponent @xmath81 parameterizes the different models .",
    "the pairing interaction has a singular frequency dependence , which makes the pairing problem in such models qualitatively different from that of the fermi liquid bcs model .",
    "the coupling strength is absorbed in the parameter @xmath82 , which is the only scale - full parameter in this model .",
    "thus the superconducting transition temperature should be proportional to @xmath82 , with a model - dependent coefficient , @xmath83 .",
    "the massless boson contributes a self - energy @xmath84 to the electron propagator , @xmath85 where @xmath86 $ ] , with @xmath87 the riemann zeta function and @xmath88 the generalized riemann zeta function .",
    "the presence of the scale - full parameter @xmath82 will generically prevent simple energy - temperature scaling of @xmath89 . only for the limits @xmath90 or @xmath91 one should recover energy - temperature scaling .      in this subsection we will consider the scenario of quantum critical bcs @xcite , where the novelty of unconventional superconductivity is attributed solely to the peculiar behavior of the electronic part in the quantum critical region , with the glue part assumed featureless . for the glue part we will use , as in the fermi liquid bcs case , the smooth and nonsingular pairing ` einstein phonon ' interaction , equation  ( [ one - phonon ] ) , to calculate the dynamical pair susceptibility in the qcbcs scenario .",
    "the quantum criticality is entirely attributed to the electronic part , i.e. , the ` bare ' pair susceptibility is assumed to be a conformally invariant state and is considered to be a relevant operator in the renormalization flow sense . in other words , this amounts to the zero temperature power - law form @xmath92 , with @xmath93 . at finite temperature ,",
    "the electronic part of the pair susceptibility can be expressed as a scaling function , @xmath94 which , in the hydrodynamical regime ( @xmath95 ) reduces to @xmath96 , with @xmath97 . note that the fermi liquid is the corresponding marginal case @xmath24 with @xmath98 . with a relevant scaling exponent @xmath99 on the other hand , more spectral weight is accumulated at lower energy scales , where pairing is more effective . the gap equation becomes algebraic instead of exponential , and this implies that even a weak glue can give rise to a high transition temperature .",
    "the qcbcs scenario is a phenomenological theory ; in the absence of a microscopic derivation of the scaling function @xmath100 a typical functional form is chosen .",
    "one example of such a typical scaling function @xmath101 that possesses the above two limiting forms at low and high temperatures can be found in @xmath102-dimensional conformal field theories , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the euler beta function , and @xmath105 .",
    "another example , which will be used to calculate the full pair susceptibility in this paper , is a simple generalization of the free fermion vertex operator , equation  ( [ gamma0-bcs ] ) , @xmath106 @xmath107 here @xmath108 is again the generalized ( hurwitz ) zeta function .",
    "since analytic continuation is trivial it is easy to confirm that this choice of vertex operator produces a relevant bare pair susceptibility with @xmath109 , a power - law tail at high frequency , and the linear hydrodynamic behavior at low frequency .",
    "there is a single peak at frequencies of order the temperature , the precise location of which we may fine - tune by introducing a parameter @xmath110 ( defined as the argument of the scaling function @xmath111 at which the low - frequency linear and high frequency power - law asymptotes would cross ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize again that qcbcs is a phenomenological theory : equation  ( [ gamma0-qc ] ) is an educated guess for what a true conformally invariant two - particle correlation function ( partially traced ) may look like .",
    "however , combined with a glue function , equation  ( [ one - phonon ] ) , it is perfectly valid input for the eliashberg framework , i.e. , the bethe - salpeter equation  ( [ master ] ) , and delivers quite a hight @xmath0 .      in the holographic approach to superconductivity",
    "the 2 + 1 dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) describing the physics at the quantum critical point is encoded in a 3 + 1 dimensional string theory in a spacetime with a negative cosmological constant ( anti - de sitter space ) @xcite . in a `` large @xmath26 , strong coupling limit ''",
    "this string theory can be approximated by classical general relativity in an asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) background coupled to various other fields .",
    "most importantly , a precise dictionary exists how to translate properties of the ads gravity theory to properties of the cft including the partition function . in particular , a global symmetry in the cft is a local symmetry in the gravity theory with the boundary - value of the gauge field identified with the source for the current in the cft .",
    "this provides the set - up for holographic superconductivity in the standard approximation where superconductivity is studied as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a global @xmath112 , that is subsequently weakly gauged to dynamical electromagnetism .",
    "the simplest model to obtain a holographic superconductor is therefore einstein gravity minimally coupled to a @xmath112 maxwell field @xmath113 and a charged complex scalar @xmath114 with charge @xmath115 and mass @xmath116.@xcite the charged scalar will be dual to the order parameter in the cft  the pairing operator .",
    "since the underlying field theory is strongly coupled there is no sense in trying to identify the order parameter as some `` weakly bound '' pair of fermions and we ought to study the order parameter directly .",
    "this system has the action _ 0=d^4x , [ action0]where @xmath117 is the ricci scalar and the ads radius @xmath118 can be set to @xmath119 .",
    "the charged ads reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole is a solution with @xmath120 .",
    "this solution has the spacetime metric and electrostatic potential [ rnbh ] ds^2&=&-f(r)dt^2++r^2(dx^2+dy^2 ) , + f(r)&=&r^2-(r_+^3+)+ , + a&=&(-)dt , where @xmath121 is the position of the horizon and @xmath122 corresponds to the charge density of the dual field theory .",
    "the temperature of the dual field theory is identified as the hawking temperature of the black hole @xmath123 , and the chemical potential is @xmath124 .",
    "the ads - rn solution preserves the @xmath112 gauge symmetry and corresponds holographically to the cft in a state at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the essence of holographic superconductivity is that below some critical temperature @xmath0 , the charged ads - rn black hole becomes unstable and develops a non - trivial ( normalizable ) scalar condensate , i.e. , @xmath125 , which breaks the @xmath112 gauge symmetry .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath126 value of @xmath114 is the value of the order parameter in the cft .",
    "thus in the dual field theory a global u(1 ) symmetry is broken correspondingly .",
    "such a minimal model therefore naturally realizes ( @xmath1-wave ) superconductivity @xcite .",
    "using explicit details of the ads / cft dictionary , the dynamical susceptibility of the spin - zero charge - two order parameter @xmath127 in the boundary field theory can be calculated from the dynamics of the fluctuations of the corresponding scalar field @xmath114 in the ads black hole background in the gravity side . at zero momentum , we can expand @xmath128 as @xmath129 .",

    "when now combined with an extended van hove singularity , mfl can produce a `` quasi - conformal '' pair susceptibility @xcite , but extreme fine tuning is required .",

    "for mflcg , the effects of the glue interactions are so strong that one ends up with a result that is barely distinguishable from cgbcs .             to our knowledge , the only way that the pair susceptibility of a mfl can resemble that of qcbcs / hsads@xmath37 in some sense is to invoke a van hove singularity in the spectrum .",
    "the idea that the presence of vhs in the dos is responsible for high temperature superconductivity has been around for some time ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an extended van hove singularity right at the fermi level can produce a relevant pair susceptibility , i.e. the real part of the pair susceptibility @xmath231 has an algebraic temperature dependence @xcite . but as will be shown below , extreme fine - tuning is needed to get energy - temperature scaling for the imaginary part of the pair susceptibility .",

    "another example is where there is an extra exponential suppression of dos at large energies ( vh2mflbcs ) , i.e. @xmath241 , for which one has @xmath242 with @xmath243 $ ] .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfl2 ] together with the case where the dos is of the strict power law form ( vh0mflbcs ) .",
    "one can see that energy - temperature scaling is broken for the two deformed cases .",
    "the qcbcs / hs approach is not really in conflict with mfl , which is well - known to be able to capture a large amount of experimental results in cuprates and heavy fermions .",
    "the pursuit of qcbcs / hs is actually orthogonal to that of mfl .",
    "mfl attacks the single particle green s functions , while qcbcs / hs focuses on the particle - particle channnel . due to vertex corrections ,",
    "the two channels are not necessarilly simply related .",
    "a clear illustration of this is the luttinger liquid , where these two channels have separate energy - temperature scaling with distinctive exponents .",
    "ads / cft seems to provide a natural framework to incorporate such luttinger - liquid - type scaling behavior in high dimensional systems , going well beyond a hertz - millis type interpretation of mfl .",
    "probing the @xmath244 background with fermions , one obtains the mfl type behavior in the fermion green s functions ; by probing the @xmath244 background with bosonic order parameters , one can detect energy - temperature scaling in the corresponding susceptibility .",
    "if we take mfl as synonymous to the fact that the electron scattering rate is proportional to the larger of temperature or frequency , the contest , that the pair tunneling experiment proposed in this paper is trying to settle , is really between the hertz - millis type interpretation of mfl and the holographic ( or call it the luttinger - liquid - type ) interpretation of mfl ."
