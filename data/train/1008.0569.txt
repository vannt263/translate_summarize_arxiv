    "one of the most successful and widely used approaches to model the qcd phase diagram in the chiral restoration regime is the njl lagrangian @xcite with the quark condensate as order parameter in the chiral limit , and its extension to incorporate the polyakov loop , the pnjl model @xcite-@xcite , where the traced polyakov loop is an order parameter in the quenched limit and an indicator of deconfinement . for realistic mass values of the light and strange quarks",
    "the order parameters are approximate quantities , since the chiral symmetry and center symmetry are explicitly broken .",
    "the estimates for the transition temperatures from the hadron to the quark gluon phase range from @xmath0 mev , according to recent lattice calculations , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite . the nature of the transition as function of the temperature and baryonic density , the eventual coincidence of chiral and deconfinement temperatures , the role played by the strange quark , the possible existence of a critical endpoint ( cep ) and the symmetry breaking pattern associated with its location , are some of the topics which are currently under intense study at experimental facilities ( gsi , rhic , cern , lhc ) , in lattice calculations and effective model approaches , see e.g. @xcite - @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "the njl model was originally introduced as an interesting field theoretical illustration of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking phenomena in particle physics . with years",
    "it became clear that the effective quark interactions capture reasonably well the main features of the low energy meson dynamics .",
    "the thermodynamics of the model is nowadays extensively used with the hope that some of the basic features of the hot and dense qcd matter are well described ( at least in the chiral symmetry restoration regime ) , and this hope has definite grounds ( see reviews @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "at the same time , the njl model thermodynamics , as it now stands , has certain internal problems , related with the cutoff dependence of the results .",
    "this is a general drawback feature of any non renormalizable field theory model . as a consequence ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of some relevant thermodynamic quantities is in conflict with some of the well known general laws .",
    "the thermodynamic potential separates naturally into the vacuum piece and the temperature dependent matter part .",
    "it has been reported that the asymptotic description of several quantities associated with the thermodynamic potential can not be achieved using the same regularization criteria on vacuum and matter integrals for all observables .",
    "for instance , the effective number of quark degrees of freedom has the correct asymptotics at large @xmath1 ( stefan - boltzmann limit ) only when the cutoff is removed from the finite matter contributions @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the removal of the regulator from the matter pieces leads asymptotically to unphysical positive condensates of the quarks , except in the chiral limit .",
    "in other words the explicit symmetry breaking pattern will be restored asymptotically only if the regulator is also kept in the matter integrals .    in the present contribution",
    "we argue that it is possible to achieve consistent regularization criteria for vacuum and matter integrals for these observables simultaneously , by obtaining the thermodynamic potential through integration of the model gap equations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the integration runs starting from zero over the whole spectrum of the auxiliary scalar fields @xmath2 and is defined up to an integration constant which can be @xmath3 dependent .",
    "we fix this constant in a regulator independent way , by requiring that the low @xmath3 behavior of the thermodynamic potential yields the correct number of degrees of freedom",
    ".    then we extend this method of obtaining the thermodynamic potential to the pnjl model . with the present treatment we obtain the correct model asymtotics for all observables considered : the number of degrees of freedom , the traced polyakov loop and the dynamical quark masses ( or condensates ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard approach which requires , as in the case of the njl model , the removal of the regulator from the finite integrals to describe the number of degrees of freedom , and its presence for the remaining observables ; for example the cutoff must be kept to describe the correct asymptotics of the traced polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "although for certain polyakov potentials , of logarithmic form @xcite,@xcite , it is still possible to display its correct asymptotics without a regulator in the matter integrals , the physical values of the condensates at high @xmath1 necessarily require its presence .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the njl and pnjl model have most widely been analyzed regularizing it with a 3d sharp cutoff .",
    "this has prompted us to use a different regularization to try to clarify the impact that the choice of a regulator may have on the asymptotics .",
    "we take the pauli - villars regularization ( pv ) @xcite which allows to check for effects associated with covariance and can be readily used in extensions of the model involving the vector mesons , where it is recommendable to use .",
    "we take the pv regularization kernel of @xcite , which to our knowledge was used for the first time in the njl model .",
    "it has the property that the scalar quadratic and logarithmic divergent amplitudes coincide with the ones of the covariant sharp cutoff . since all the pv regulated integrals",
    "can be written in 3-momentum space with 3-momentum dependent regulators , it is easy to trace the differences between the two methods .",
    "this comparison between regularizations will lead us to the conclusion that if one follows the steps indicated above to derive the thermodynamic potential , both the pv and @xmath4 sharp cutoff regularizations can be used to achieve the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "the paper set up is as follows . after a brief review in section ii of the pv",
    "regularized fermion one - loop determinant for the njl thermodynamic potential obtained in @xcite , which we use to introduce the notation , we proceed in section iii to regularize the pnjl model with the pv regularization .",
    "the large @xmath1 asymptotic behavior of several thermodynamic quantities is discussed in section iv .",
    "numerical results for the effective number of degrees of freedom , gap equation solutions for the constituent quark masses and polyakov loop fields are given in section v , using several parametrizations for the polyakov potential and parameter sets for the many - quark lagrangian .",
    "these results are compared with the conventional way of calculating with the 3d cutoff .",
    "conclusions are presented in section vi . in the appendix c",
    "we discuss how the present procedure can be adapted to the 3d sharp cut - off case , leading to compatible results for both types of regularization applied on the amplitudes considered .",
    "in a recent investigation @xcite we have proven and discussed in great detail how to obtain the correct asymptotics of the effective number of quark degrees of freedom at large @xmath1 for the njl model , using the pv regularization applied to vacuum and matter integrals .",
    "this study was done for the njl model extended to include the t hooft @xmath5 ( @xmath6 number of flavors ) determinant interaction @xcite,@xcite,@xcite related with the axial @xmath7 anomaly , and the eight quark interaction lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the latter is proven necessary to render the ground state of the theory stable in the case of @xmath8 @xcite , @xcite,@xcite . in the text",
    "we refer to these extensions of the njl model as njlh and njlh8 respectively ( whereas the polyakov extensions are referred to as pnjlh and pnjlh8 ) .",
    "the resulting thermodynamic potential as function of the three independent variables @xmath9 and @xmath3 was derived to be @xcite @xmath10 through integration of the gap - equations : @xmath11 these are solved self - consistently with the stationary phase conditions ( spa ) @xmath12 to yield the constituent quark masses @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 are the current quark masses , @xmath15 , ( @xmath16 ) , is defined as twice the quark condensate in the symmetry broken phase , and we use the abbreviations @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denote respectively the @xmath19 and the two @xmath20 coupling strengths , of which @xmath21 corresponds to a ozi - violating combination . given the following specific constraints among the couplings , @xmath22 , there exists only a single real solution to the cubic spa equations @xcite and the global stability of the effective potential is guaranteed . for simplicity the case with @xmath23 was considered , generalization to account for nonzero isospin chemical potential can be done as e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the quark one loop integrals in ( [ gap - t ] ) are given by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 describes the vacuum contribution .",
    "the integral @xmath26 resulting from the integration over @xmath2 , @xmath27 splits into a vacuum , @xmath28 and a medium contribution , @xmath29 to obtain the second equality a partial integration has been performed , the boundary term vanishes for the pv regularization .",
    "the notation @xmath30 , and @xmath31 refers to the quark and antiquark occupation numbers for massless and massive particles correspondingly , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , generically defined as : @xmath34 the pauli - villars regulazion kernel that we employ , @xmath35 corresponds to two subtractions in the integrand @xcite .",
    "the pv result has some unconventional features .",
    "first note the occurrence of occupation numbers for massless particles in ( [ j-1med ] ) .",
    "these are due to the thermodynamic potential being a direct extension to finite @xmath3 of the effective potential which is normalized to @xmath36 and implies the zero mass energy subtraction in the vacuum piece ( [ j_1 ] ) , @xcite , @xcite . as opposed to a 3d sharp cutoff , this subtraction in ( [ j_1 ] ) , which is a natural consequence of requiring the power series expansion of the effective potential to start off at zero when the quark masses vanish , is also necessary in the pv regularization scheme to render the 3-momentum integration finite , despite the presence of the regulator . once one accepts the evidence that thermodynamic consistency can not be achieved if only the vacuum is regularized ( shown in the following sections ) , the massless occupation numbers must be fully considered in the regularization of the matter parts .",
    "second there occurs the term @xmath37 , with the following significance .",
    "the degrees of freedom associated with the massless occupation numbers do not vanish in the @xmath38 limit .",
    "we use a freedom associated with an integration constant associated to the integration of the mass gap equations to impose the boundary condition that as @xmath38 the correct limit is obtained .",
    "this leads to the @xmath2 independent quantity @xmath39 since at low @xmath1 the matter integrals depending on non - vanishing quark masses ( and thus also on the pv regulating masses ) vanish exponentially @xcite , @xmath37 is regularization independent and coincides with the corresponding regulated expression ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the matter quark - loop part of the thermodynamic potential at finite @xmath3 , i.e. the @xmath41-part of the thermodynamic potential , together with the boundary condition term @xmath37 , coincides in the low @xmath1 regime with the matter part obtained with the standard approach when the 3d sharp cutoff is removed ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the large @xmath1 asymptotics is as well correctly described .",
    "the reason is that at high @xmath1 the regularization of the matter parts becomes relevant .",
    "this is taken into account in the pv regulated thermodynamic potential ( [ effpot - t ] ) .",
    "in other words we have shown that combining the @xmath37 term with the regularized expression for massless contributions eliminates completely any contribution of massless states to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "what remains are the unphysical states associated with the corresponding pv regulating masses which in turn are cancelled by the pv regulators of the massive states at leading order of the high t expansion .",
    "thus all auxiliary fields introduced in the regulating process are absent in the asymptotic description , leading to the model parameter independent and correct result for the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this was proven in all detail in @xcite .    in the present work we adopt a different but equivalent way of looking at these cancellations .",
    "we separate the term @xmath37 , which does not depend on the regulator , from the remaining regulator dependent matter pieces . doing so we show in section 4 and in the appendix a that the regularized contributions lead in the high @xmath1 limit to the vacuum expression , up to a sign . the full cancellation of the regularized matter and vacuum pieces at high @xmath1 allows to understand easily the asymptotic behavior of the thermodynamic potential and gap equations .",
    "superficially seen this way to group terms may create the illusion that the @xmath37 is an unphysical stefan - boltzman contribution associated with massless terms .",
    "it is not , since the regularized expression itself contains massless terms which cancel it .",
    "this is very easily understood by considering the expression ( [ equ ] ) of the appendix .",
    "the leading terms in the high @xmath1 expansion for the massless and massive terms are equal to each other and to the @xmath37 term .",
    "their roles can be trivially interchanged .",
    "this result is the simple consequence that at high @xmath1 terms of the order @xmath43 can be neglected .",
    "we recall that in the case with 3d cutoff the @xmath44 subtractions are not performed and the regulator is a step function @xmath45 . besides this the integrand of our medium contribution @xmath46 differs by a partial integration from the @xmath4 cutoff one , since the corresponding surface term vanishes in the pv case , as opposed to the @xmath4 case .",
    "we are now ready to extend our analysis to include the polyakov loop dynamics @xcite-@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , ( in the present work we do not consider the dressed polyakov loop case , see e.g @xcite- @xcite ) .",
    "this is effected by coupling the quark and gluonic fields in the temporal gauge through the covariant derivative @xmath47 , with @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the standard gell - mann matrices in color space ) and by assuming the temporal component in euclidean space - time @xmath51 to be static and diagonal @xmath52 ( the polyakov gauge ) . in addition , a temperature dependent pure gluonic term is introduced through the polyakov potential @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the traced polyakov loop and @xmath55 its charge conjugate @xmath56 with @xmath57 representing the number of colors and @xmath58 denoting path - ordering . in the framework of the model @xmath54 and @xmath59",
    "are treated as classical field variables .",
    "the form of the potential @xmath53 can be determined , for instance , from lattice calculations in the pure gauge sector .",
    "several parametrizations have been considered and we shall address them below ( see table [ polyakovpot ] ) .    in the polyakov gauge it has been shown that the phase of the polyakov loop appears in the quark action in the form of an imaginary chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this observation allows for a simple extension of the thermodynamic potential through the following steps :    \\(i ) replacement of the occupation numbers in ( [ j-1med ] ) by the tilde quantities @xmath60 the equivalent expression for @xmath61 can be obtained by replacing @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in absence of the gauge field , @xmath64 , one obtains @xmath65 , and one recovers the occupation numbers ( [ n - occup ] ) .",
    "note that in the presence of a non - vanishing gauge field the limiting value unity for @xmath66 is also reached as @xmath67 , but then obviously the limit must be taken simultaneously in all terms of @xmath68 .",
    "\\(ii ) specification of the values of @xmath66 at the integration boundary @xmath44 . on first sight",
    ", it might seem natural to systematically implement the substitution ( [ occpol ] ) also for the massless occupation numbers .",
    "however this would lead to a dependence on @xmath66 of @xmath69 which must be field independent in order not to alter the gap equations .",
    "therefore , recalling that the boundary @xmath44 has been introduced at @xmath70 , in absence of the polyakov loop , the values of @xmath66 are bound to be unity .    as a result of these conditions we obtain the final expression for the thermodynamic potential including the polyakov loop as @xmath71    the minimization of the thermodynamic potential with respect to @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath54 and @xmath59 gives rise to the gap equations .",
    "at this stage we are already able to draw the following conclusion about the pv regularization on the asymptotic value of the total number of degrees of freedom @xmath75 .",
    "this quantity at @xmath76 is defined as the pressure difference from the zero - temperature value , in stefan - boltzmann units @xmath77 , @xmath78 with @xmath79 , where the starred values @xmath80 denote the gap equation solutions at a given @xmath1 . in @xcite , where the extension to include the polyakov loop was not considered , we explain how the asymptotic behavior of this quantity for large @xmath1 comes completely and correctly determined by @xmath69 independently of the model parameters .",
    "now , according to our observation ( ii ) above , the covariant derivative coupling of the polyakov loop to the quarks does not affect @xmath69 .",
    "in the extended version of the model , here considered , once again the asymptotic values for the quark number degrees of freedom at large @xmath1 is determined by @xmath69 whereas the polyakov potential @xmath81 will be the only source of degrees of freedom associated with the polyakov loop at large @xmath1 ; ( henceforth we drop the * denoting the gap equation solutions in text and figures , in order to simplify the notation ) .",
    "the reason for this is as follows : in the @xmath67 limit we obtain that @xmath82 , since then the matter part @xmath83 is independent of @xmath66 and equal to the negative of the vacuum expression , @xmath84 , eq .",
    "( [ j_1 ] ) .",
    "the same happens in the case of the @xmath85 integrals ( [ j0 t ] ) , which reduce to the vacuum expression in the high @xmath1 limit .",
    "thus the @xmath86 dependent terms in the pressure also vanish in this limit through the gap equations ( [ gap - t ] ) .",
    "therefore we conclude two things .",
    "firstly , since the matter parts become up to a sign identical to their vacuum pieces as @xmath67 , they need to be regularized to guarantee asymptotic consistency , see also @xcite , @xcite .",
    "secondly , the large t asymptotics for the @xmath66 related number of degrees of freedom is fully driven by the potential term @xmath87 .",
    "this can also be understood reversing the argument , i.e. leaving the medium part unregularized , which consists in discarding the pv subtractions . in this case , using the following representation @xcite ( we consider here for simplicity the case with @xmath65 and @xmath76 since it does not alter the large asymptotic t dependence of the integral ) for a term in @xmath88 ( see the appendix for a more detailed discussion ) @xmath89 the last term is the leading contribution in an expansion for @xmath90 .",
    "the unregularized @xmath88 has then the same large @xmath1 dependence @xmath91 as the polyakov loop potential @xmath92 and can mingle with its asymptotics .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that the complete @xmath93 regularized expression , including the @xmath37 term has also a @xmath94 dependence at large @xmath1 .",
    "however in this case the dependence is due alone to the @xmath37 term which , as mentioned before , is independent of @xmath95 and is thus decoupled from the large @xmath1 asymptotics of the polyakov loop degrees of freedom ( see also the appendix ) .",
    "a further remark is in order .",
    "the gap equations must be solved together with the spa equations ( [ staeq ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath85 integrals vanish as @xmath67 , we obtain that @xmath96 .",
    "this guarantees that in the large @xmath1 asymptotics the explicit chiral symmetry breaking pattern of the model is recovered .",
    "we emphasize once again that this result can only be obtained if the regulator is kept in dirac and fermi contributions of the one - loop quark integrals .",
    "it is easy to understand that failing to do so , the matter parts will diverge at large @xmath1 , driving instead the solutions of the gap equations to @xmath97 .",
    "the same argument as above in ( [ int4 ] ) can be applied to infer that the not regularized @xmath98 diverges as @xmath99 .",
    "details are discussed in the appendix , part b. we shall return to these large @xmath1 asymptotic features in our numerical results presented in the figures below .",
    "before discussing the numerical results we specify in table [ polyakovpot ] several types of polyakov potentials proposed in the literature which we shall employ in our analysis . the polyakov potential and the pure gauge qcd lagrangian should share the @xmath100 center symmetry , spontaneously broken above a critical temperature ( for @xmath67 the minimum should correspond to @xmath101 ) .",
    "the polynomial form @xmath102 is based on a ginzburg - landau ansatz using the terms with the required symmetry ( the cubic @xmath54 terms are needed to break the @xmath103 symmetry down to the @xmath100 ) , the exponential term in @xmath104 was derived in the strong coupling expansion of the lattice qcd action and the logarithmic term ( which appears in @xmath105 , @xmath104 and @xmath106 ) is inspired by the @xmath107 haar measure of group integration .    in table",

    "2- we obtain that the constituent quark masses and the polyakov classical fields @xmath66 calculated with the pv as well as the 3d sharp cutoff regularizations lead to similar consistent asymptotic results , when the fermi distributions are regularized .",
    "the quark masses approach the current quark mass values at large @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding condensates vanish .",
    "as opposed to this a removal of the regulator from the matter parts would result in vanishing quark masses in the large @xmath1 limit , which in turn are associated with unphysical positive condensates . regarding the @xmath66 fields",
    ", we show that the polyakov potential @xmath155 drives the large @xmath1 asymptotic behavior of the @xmath156 gap equation solutions when the matter integrals are regulated .",
    "consequently the `` overshooting '' of these variables at large @xmath1 above the values of the minima of @xmath155 in the examples shown is consequence of inadequately removing the cutoff from the finite matter integrals .",
    "3- the fact that in point 1 only the pv regularization of vacuum and matter integrals leads to a consistent description of the asymptotic behavior , while in point 2 also the 3d regularization applied to vacuum and matter parts works , has a very simple reason .",
    "the constituent quark masses and @xmath66 can only detect effects related with the gap equations , while the number of degrees of freedom are highly sensitive to the @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath13 and @xmath66 independent integration constant @xmath37 ( therefore irrelevant for the gap equations ) which is associated with the proposed procedure to derive the thermodynamic potential through integration of the gap equations .",
    "4- finally , it is possible to extend the method presented here to the 3d cutoff procedure ( see appendix c ) and in this case both the results of pv and 3d regularizations will be compatible with each other with the same degree of thermodynamic consistency for the observables discussed .",

    "the results for the gap equations for @xmath180 are known analytically in the @xmath151 limit and serve to illustrate some features of the asymptotics of the more general cases considered in section v. supposing once again that the medium part is not regularized , one obtains in the chiral limit and for vanishing chemical potential , for @xmath181 that    @xmath182}{d \\phi}|_{\\overline{\\phi}=\\phi}= 2 t^4 \\frac { [ l_{i3}(\\frac{2}{1 - 3 \\phi -\\sqrt{(9 \\phi^2 -6 \\phi-3 ) } } ) - l_{i3}(\\frac{2}{1 - 3 \\phi + \\sqrt{(9 \\phi^2 -6 \\phi-3)}})]}{\\sqrt{(9 \\phi^2 -6 \\phi-3)}},\\ ] ]    with @xmath183 the polylogarythm function of 3rd order , and similarly for the derivative with respect to @xmath59 due to the symmetry under @xmath184 of the thermodynamic potential in absence of @xmath109 . since the hight @xmath1 dependence is the same as for the derivatives of the polyakov potential , one obtains that the asymptotic values of @xmath54 are also steered by the medium part of the quark loop integral in presence of the polyakov loop .",
    "in particular as @xmath185 the contribution to the gap equation for the @xmath54 variable stemming from the quark loop integral is @xmath186}{d \\phi}|_{\\overline{\\phi}=\\phi=1}= \\frac{-8\\pi^2}{3 } $ ] .",
    "thus it is evident that @xmath187 can not be the asymptotic solution of the gap equation for @xmath54 for polynomial polyakov potentials that display a minimum at @xmath187 in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "we illustrate in fig . 6 for the @xmath107 flavor limit the behavior of the regularization dependence of the solutions of the quark mass gap equation by plotting the quark one - loop integral @xmath188 of eq .",

    "( [ staeq ] ) to express @xmath2 as function of @xmath190 , since there is a one to one correspondence between these quantities for the model parameters that ensure the existence of a stable effective potential .",
    "the intersection of the dashed line and solid lines indicates the solution in the dynamically broken phase of chiral symmetry at a certain temperature ( here we considered vanishing chemical potential and set @xmath65 ) .",

    "the solid lines correspond to the evaluation @xmath193 for different temperatures .",
    "the rightmost panel corresponds to the case where the medium part is not regularized , whereas in the other two all contributions are pv regularized . in all of them",
    "the increase in temperature corresponds to an increase in the negative contribution coming from the medium part . from top",
    "to bottom the lines correspond to : @xmath194 .",
    "one can see that in the chiral limit the intersection ceases to exist above a certain critical temperature leaving only the trivial solution ( @xmath44 ) . with the inclusion of a finite current mass",
    "there is always an intersection because of the divergence near the pole . in the fully regularized version",
    "the integral tends to zero with increasing temperature and as a result the intersection tends to the solution @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "when the medium contribution is unregularized the integral diverges with the temperature and as a result the intersection tends to the pole ( @xmath44 ) .      in fig .",
    "7 we show that in presence of the polyakov loop and for non - vanishing chemical potential the pattern of the solutions for the @xmath107 chiral limit with overall pv regularization ( left panel ) is still similar to the case presented on the left of fig .",
    "6 . removing the cutoff from the matter part ( right panel )",
    "changes the behavior of the solid curves only at somewhat higher temperatures . in this case , since the intersection ceases to exist at low temperatures , i.e. a first order transition takes place , the effect of removing the regulator is not noticeable in the solutions . therefore in our study of the regularization effects on the gap equation solutions for the polyakov loop at high temperature in the chiral limit we can start in the phase where the chiral transition has taken place for the quark mass .        the pertinent feynman amplitudes @xmath197 , eq .

    "( [ j-1]),([j_1]),([j-1med ] ) are conveniently expressed in terms of the pv regularization kernel ( [ pv ] ) , which can be readily exchanged by other regularization kernels .",
    "we consider now the case of the 3d sharp cutoff regulator @xmath198 where the first term leaves the integrand unmodified in similarity with the pv regulator .",
    "the pv subtractions are then to be replaced by the second term of @xmath199 .",
    "this leads to the following results for the integrals considered :    \\(i ) it is easy to verify that the following vacuum integral which is part of @xmath200 without zero mass subtraction is finite , as opposed to the pv case , but non - zero at @xmath44 @xmath201 ) .",

    "however this will not affect the high @xmath1 asymptotics , which will be lead by the @xmath206 term , as in the pv case , see below .",
    "the remaining integral behaves qualitatively like in the pv case , with the same leading order behavior in the low and high @xmath1 expansions . to see this",
    ", we use again representation ( [ ap1 ] ) to obtain ( at @xmath76 ) @xmath207 the regulator dependent piece , the second integral , differs from the corresponding expression for the pv subtractions , but also vanishes exponentially with @xmath1 as @xmath38 for non zero values of @xmath2 and @xmath108 as in the pv case .",
    "therefore , as in the pv case the low @xmath1 behavior stems again from the same unphysical zero mass occupation states ( the regulator independent part of the second integral of ( [ j-1ap ] ) ) ; the @xmath37 term , eq .",
    "( [ ftp ] ) , is used analogously to correct it .",
    "therefore the low and high @xmath1 behavior will be the same as in the pv case .    in fig .",
    "8 are shown the degrees of freedom for the pnjl model calculated with the advocated way of obtaining the thermodynamic potential , using the pv and the 3d sharp cutoff regulators .",
    "one sees that the low and high @xmath1 regimes coincide . in the crossover region",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is higher for the 3d cutoff as for the pv regulator .",
