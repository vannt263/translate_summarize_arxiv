    "with the ability to point in several directions at once , wide fractional bandwidths , and large collecting area , the first lwa station will make important scientific contributions in several fields .",
    "we have been refining the science case for lwa1 over 5 years ",
    "see kassim  ( 2006 , 2010 ) , clarke  ( 2009 ) , rickard  ( 2010 ) , and lazio  ( 2010 ) for details .",
    "projects granted observing time in the first ( primarily internal ) call for proposals cover a range of topics including pulsars , transients , cosmology , galactic science , the sun , and the earth s ionosphere ( see table  3 ) .",
    "below we elaborate upon several of these topics and the headway that lwa1 will soon make in each .",
    "pulsars are fascinating objects with spin periods and magnetic fields strengths ranging over 4 and 5 orders of magnitude respectively . though it is well accepted that pulsars are rotating neutron stars , the pulsar emission mechanism and the geometry of the emitting region are still poorly understood ( eilek  2005 ) .",
    "lwa1 will be an excellent telescope for the study of pulsars including single pulse studies , and studies of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "in fact it is in lwa1 frequency band range where strong evolution in pulsar radio emission can be observed , e.g , a turn over in the flux density spectrum , significant pulse broadening , and complex changes in the pulse profile morphologies ( malofeev  1994 ) . and ,",
    "although pulsars were discovered at low frequency ( b1919 + 21 at 81 mhz ; hewish  1968 ) , there is a remarkable lack of observational data in the lwa1 frequency range .",
    "[ fig : b1919 + 21 ] shows an lwa1 observation of b1919 + 21 ; and the lwa1 will detect dozens more ( see jacoby  2007 ) in less than 1000 seconds .",
    "lwa1 is able to perform spectral studies of pulsars over a wide frequency range and with high spectral resolution",
    ". this will allow investigators to look for drifting subpulses .",
    "strong notches have been seen to appear in the profiles of pulsars at low frequencies ( hankins 1973 ) , but little progress has been made in understanding their origin .",
    "some pulsars may reach 100% linear polarization at low frequencies ( b1929 + 10 ; manchester  1973 ) .",
    "in addition to being intrinsically of interest ( providing clues about the pulsar magnetospheric structure ) , such strongly polarized beacons can assist in probing coronal mass ejections and determining the orientation of their magnetic fields .",
    "that orientation can strongly influence their effects if they impact the earth ( kassim  2010 ) .",
    "lwa1 s large collecting area will be particularly useful for `` single pulse '' science , including studies of crab giant pulses ( cgps ; bhat  2007 ) and anomalously intense pulses ( aips ; stappers  2011 ) .",
    "the crab pulsar intermittently produces single pulses having intensity greater than those of the normal periodic emission by orders of magnitude . despite extensive observations and study ,",
    "the mechanism behind cgps remains mysterious .",
    "observations of the crab pulsar across the electromagnetic spectrum can distinguish between various models for gp emission such as enhanced pair cascades , radio coherence , and changes in beaming direction .",
    "to date the study of the cgp emission at low radio frequencies is only very sparsely explored .",
    "reported modern observations of cgps in this frequency regime are limited to just a few in recent years including utr-2 at 23 mhz ( popov  2006 ) , mwa at 200 mhz ( bhat  2007 ) , and lofar lba ( stappers  2011 ) .",
    "lwa1 will be able to provide hundreds of hours per year of sensitive observations of cgps which could significantly increase our knowledge of the time- and frequency - domain characteristics of these enigmatic events",
    ".    we should be able to measure scattering for practically every good cgp detection ( s / n @xmath020 or better ) , and it is known that both the dispersion and scattering of the crab emission can vary dramatically on short or long time scales . by observing over an extremely broad bandwidth , we may be able to better quantify the scatter broadening and thereby assess the level and importance of anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , the broad bandwidth of the observations will be helpful in shedding light on the issue of the frequency scaling of the scattering ( believed to be @xmath03.6 compared to the canonical value of @xmath04.4 for the general ism ) , which is thought to be related to the nature of turbulence in the nebula .",
    "anomalous high intensity single pulses from known pulsars have been reported previously using the utr-2 ( ulyanov  2006 ) and lofar ( stappers  2011 ) . these anomalously intense pulses ( aips )",
    "have many features similar to the giant pulse phenomenon , including emission in a narrow longitude interval and power - law distribution of the pulse energy .",
    "one distinctive feature of these aips , however , is that they are generated by subpulses or some more short lived structures within subpulses .",
    "the emission is seen to be quite narrow band , typically 1 mhz in bandwidth .",
    "the nature of such pulses is not yet understood .",
    "lwa1 with its excellent sensitivity and large available bandwidth provides an opportunity to study these pulses .      the magnetized planets in our solar system are well known to produce extremely bright coherent radio emission at low frequencies ( e.g. , carr  1983 ) .",
    "in the past decade , with the abundant detection of planets around other stellar systems , much theoretical work has been carried out on the detection of similar radio emission from extrasolar planets ( e.g. , lazio  2009 ) .",
    "such a detection is the only currently viable method for measuring the magnetic fields and rotation rates of extrasolar planets , and it may provide information about the other properties , such as interior composition . for a terrestrial - mass planet , a magnetic field may be important for determining its habitability by protecting the planet from energetic particles .",
    "the brightest extrasolar planets are the hot jupiters ( hjs ) , which we define as having semimajor axes less than 0.5  au and masses above 0.5  jovian masses .",
    "using lwa1 , we will conduct a volume - limited search out to 50  pc for decametric emission from all known hjs in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the observational capabilities of lwa1 are uniquely suited to the properties of these sources :    * * low - frequency coverage .",
    "* decametric emission from a hj will exhibit a sharp cutoff at the electron cyclotron frequency of the planet s magnetic field , with typical cutoffs ranging from 1100  mhz .",
    "the lwa1 s benign rfi environment allows observation down to 20  mhz routinely , and down to 10  mhz during favorable ionospheric conditions . *",
    "* sensitivity to polarized and `` bursty '' emission .",
    "* hj emission is expected to be highly polarized and released in bursts with timescales of @xmath01  ms to @xmath010  s ; lwa1 observations provide full stokes parameters and better than 1  ms temporal resolution .",
    "* * extensive coverage of many targets .",
    "* the emission may be narrowly beamed , intersecting the earth for a small fraction of the 10100  hr rotational periods for some sources , while missing earth entirely for others .",
    "the multiple independent beams of lwa1 allow us to dedicate approximately 300  beam - hours to begin this survey . * * mjy sensitivity .",
    "* the large collecting area of lwa1 allows us to achieve a typical ( non - imaging ) sensitivity of 10  mjy for each observation in our survey ( of duration 14 hours ) , lower than the @xmath0100  mjy flux densities predicted for some hjs ( griessmeier  2007 ) .    to date , searches below 70  mhz have had sensitivities of no better than 100  mjy ( zarka 2007 ) . after only six months of observation",
    ", we will either make a detection or be able to place tight constraints on models for hj emission .",
    "additionally , lwa1 will be used to conduct _ blind _",
    "searches for hj emission . based on stellar density estimates of the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , howard  2010 )",
    ", we expect approximately 5,000 hjs within 100  pc . at a probable detection frequency of 20  mhz ,",
    "an lwa1 beam is @xmath050  deg@xmath8 at zenith ( and larger still at lower altitudes ) , on average covering six nearby but unknown hjs . to detect these sources ,",
    "we will add a search of bursty , highly polarized emission to our analysis of the beamformed data .",
    "candidate detections will be followed up with dedicated observational programs to look for periodicity of such emission , a sign that we have detected a hj or similarly emitting brown dwarf .",
    "astrophysical transient sources of radio emission signal the explosive release of energy from compact sources ( see lazio  2010 , cordes & mclaughlin 2003 for reviews ) . known types of radio transients include cosmic ray airshowers , solar flares (  2.5 ) , jovian flares and flares from extrasolar hot jupiters (  2.2 ) , giant flares from magnetars ( cameron  2005 ) , rotating radio transients ( mclaughlin  2006 ) , giant pulses from the crab pulsar (  2.1 ) , and supernovae .",
    "the study of these sudden releases of energy allow us to recognize these rare objects , and yield insights to the nature of the sources including energetics , rotation rates , magnetic field strengths , and particle acceleration mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , some radio transients remain unidentified such as the galactic center radio transient gcrt j1745@xmath93009 ( hyman  2005 ) , and require further study .",
    "a number of sources have been predicted to produce strong radio transients , but have not yet been observed , including prompt emission from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; benz & paesold 1998 ) , neutron star mergers ( hansen & lyutikov 2001 ) , expiration of primordial black holes ( rees 1977 ; blandford 1977 ) , topological phase transitions in primordial black holes ( kavic 2008 ) , and superconducting cosmic strings ( vachaspati 2008 ) .",
    "a number of instruments have been built to study the meter - wavelength transient radio sky including the cambridge low frequency synthesis telescope ( dessenne  1996 ) , the fallbrook low - frequency immediate response telescope ( flirt ; balsano 1999 ) , the eight - meter transient array ( eta ; deshpande 2009 ) , and the long wavelength demonstrator array ( lwda ; lazio  2010 ) .",
    "these surveys had limited collecting area , field - of - view , or availability .",
    "lwa1 will far surpass the limits set by these instruments , in sensitivity by two orders of magnitude , and with access to much of the sky all the time .",
    "the prototype all - sky monitor ( pasi ) is a software correlator and imager for lwa1 that analyzes the tbn data stream , which provides continuous samples from all dipoles with a 75  khz passband placeable anywhere within 1088  mhz ( see  3 ) .",
    "pasi images nearly the whole sky ( @xmath10@xmath11  sr ) every five seconds , continuously and in near realtime , with full stokes parameters and typical sensitivities of @xmath05  jy at frequencies above 40  mhz and @xmath020  jy at 20  mhz .",
    "candidate detections can be followed up within seconds by beamformed observations for improved sensitivity and localization .",
    "these capabilities provide an unprecedented opportunity to search the synoptic low - frequency sky .",
    "pasi saves visibility data for @xmath020 days , allowing it to `` look back in time '' in response to transient alerts .",
    "the images generated by pasi will be archived indefinitely .",
    "lwa1 will also search for single dispersed pulses or cosmic `` events '' using beamforming mode .",
    "this mode trades all - sky capability for greater bandwidth and time resolution .",
    "multiple beams will be used to mitigate against interference . in 50 - 70 mhz",
    ", any given coordinate will remain in the beam for about 14 minutes , which is sufficient to view the entire duration of pulses with dm up to @xmath01100 pc @xmath12 .",
    "ultimately , we plan for lwa1 to generate and accept alerts for multi - wavelength follow - up ; its observations will be even more valuable in conjunction with the results of other facilities surveying large areas of the sky ( e.g. , fermi , pan - starrs , lsst , ligo ) .",
    "furthermore , lwa1 is complementary to lofar in that the two instruments have little simultaneous overlap on the sky , but complimentary in that it has much better access to the galactic center and inner plane where one might expect some transient populations to be concentrated ( kassim  2003 ) .",
    "understanding the origin , formation , and evolution of the first galaxies is one of the major questions of astrophysics .",
    "identified by the astro2010 decadal review ( new worlds , new horizons in astronomy and astrophysics ) as an area ripe for exciting new discoveries , the period of `` cosmic dawn '' encompasses the formation of the first galaxies and black holes .",
    "these luminous sources produce uv and x - ray radiation that radically alters the properties of the diffuse neutral hydrogen gas that fills the majority of space at these times .",
    "it is crucial that we develop observational probes of this era since this would give valuable insights into the energetics of the early universe and the processes of initial galaxy formation .",
    "one unique avenue for observationally constraining the radiative properties of the first luminous objects is via low frequency radio observations of the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen ( madau  1997 ) .",
    "coupling with the gas temperature results in the hi line being seen in absorption at high redshifts , when the gas is cooler than the cmb due to adiabatic expansion ( during the so - called `` dark ages '' ) ; it appears in emission at lower redshifts , after the gas becomes heated by x - rays from the first stars and black holes .",
    "according to theoretical models , the turnover between these regimes is around z @xmath0 17 , at 80 mhz ( furlanetto  2006 ; pritchard & loeb 2008 ) , and the maximum absorption occurs between 50 and 100 mhz ( pritchard & loeb 2010 ) .",
    "[ fig : darkages ] shows a theoretical model for the temperature history of the early universe , along with the predicted hi absorption signature .",
    "j. bowman and collaborators have proposed a novel approach to measuring the global 21 cm signature using lwa1 .",
    "they will detect or constrain the absorption peak that marks the end of the dark age using lwa1 .",
    "lwa1 is well - matched to the expected frequency range of the absorption peak , and by simultaneously forming a science beam that targets a relatively cold region of sky and a strong source with a known spectrum , they will achieve a lower foreground and a better spectral calibration than single - antenna experiments allow .",
    "furthermore , they will be able to repeat the experiment using different patches of sky , which further reduces the problem of foregrounds and allows for follow - ups of any marginal detections .",
    "this approach requires no additional hardware beyond what has already been developed for lwa1 and can be accomplished in @xmath0500 beam hours .",
    "greenhill , werthimer , taylor , and ellingson have proposed a more ambitious method to measure or constrain the hi signal from the transition between the dark ages and widespread reionization .",
    "the large aperture experiment to detect the dark ages ( leda ) comprises ( i ) a large - n correlator deployed to the lwa1 ( 512 inputs , 60 mhz ) , ( ii ) hardware to equip four outrigger dipoles for ( redundant ) calibrated total - power measurement , and ( iii ) a data calibration pipeline with which to reconstruct the full - stokes sky brightness over a @xmath13 field of view , measure and correct for direction - dependent gains of individual stands , and measure and correct for refractive offsets created by the ionosphere ( see greenhill & bernardi 2012 ) . in leda ,",
    "the array will serve to enable calibrations that can not be achieved with a single antenna ; the outriggers will deliver the data streams from which the 21 cm science will be derived .",
    "the wide - band , wide - field sky model and antenna calibrations derived from array data will enable foreground subtraction ( from the total power data ) .",
    "use of multiple outriggers and a calibration array that can be subdivided to yield independent measurements will enable quantification of systematics .",
    "cross - correlation for a large - n array scales as o(n@xmath8 ) and poses significant computing challenges .",
    "hundreds of apertures and frequency channels , and tens of mhz bandwidth require 10@xmath14 to 10@xmath15 operation per second .",
    "the leda fx correlator will combine field programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) serving the o(n ) f stage and graphics processing units ( gpus ) serving the o(n@xmath8 ) x stage ( clark , laplante , greenhill 2012 ) .",
    "application of gpus , which may be coded in a c - like environment , reduced development time and cost while delivering nearly 80% utilization of the gpu floating point resources ( single precision ) and ready reconfigurability .",
    "we note that detecting the 21 cm signal from the dark ages has many challenges to overcome including foreground subtraction , understanding sidelobe systematics , mitigating rfi and mutual coupling , and coping with ionospheric distortions .",
    "it could be that space - borne measurements are needed to bypass rfi and ionospheric effects .",

    "both maps contain a few seconds of data and use 4 khz of bandwidth .",
    "the maps were made using data from just 8 dipoles relatively close to each other in lwa1 .",
    "the resolution is 10 degrees .",
    "the peak in the burst map is about 5000 times brighter than the peak in the pre - burst map.,width=480 ]    type iii bursts are generated by beams of nonthermal kev - energy electrons propagating out from the sun on open field lines , producing radio emission at the local plasma frequency by plasma emission , i.e. , conversion of electrostatic langmuir waves into electromagnetic waves .",
    "since the electrons are travelling rapidly outward into a plasma of decreasing density , the corresponding radio bursts drift rapidly downwards in frequency and appear as nearly vertical features in frequency - versus - time plots ( `` dynamic spectra '' ) .",
    "the currently favored `` stochastic growth '' theory for plasma emission predicts a log - normal distribution for wave - field strengths in these bursts ( e.g. , cairns & robinson 1999 ) that can be tested with lwa1 data .",
    "by contrast , type ii bursts are associated with shocks propagating through the solar corona .",
    "they are usually associated with coronal mass ejections , which can generate shocks as they move through the solar atmosphere at high speed . however , there are aspects of type ii bursts that appear to be correlated with the structure of the flaring region itself .",
    "type ii bursts show much substructure in frequency - time plots that may be associated with inhomogeneity in the shock , and with the mechanism for generation of langmuir waves .",
    "the exact nature of the source of plasma emission in type ii bursts is still not entirely understood : it could be due to widespread electron beams , as in type iii bursts , but this is more likely to be true of the structures known as `` herringbone '' , short - lived fast - drift structures seen to emerge from the backbone of type ii emission .",
    "lwa1 data sampled at high temporal and spectral resolution may give clues to acceleration processes in the shock creating the burst .",
    "moving type iv bursts are associated with large solar eruptions and can move several degrees at thousands of km / s : in extreme cases lwa1 s high signal - to - noise should permit it to measure such motions even with the large beam and reinvigorate a field of study that has been largely dormant for 20 years due to the lack of imaging at lwa1 s frequencies where these intriguing ( and potentially space - weather relevant ) phenomena occur .      radio recombination lines ( rrls ) arise in ionized and partially ionized gas , and therefore offer valuable probes of the physical condition of the diffuse ionized interstellar medium . in particular , the size of the electron orbit increases for high quantum numbers , making the particles extremely sensitive to temperature and density of the medium . at lwa1 frequencies the excitation temperature approaches the kinetic temperature and rrls",

    "9 ; stepkin et al .  2007 ; kantharia & anantharamaiah 2001 ;",
    "erickson   1995 ) .",
    "hydrogen rrls at these frequencies are as yet undetected , perhaps due to a dielectronic electron capture mechanism increasing the chance of absorption in atoms with multiple electrons such as carbon ( walmsley & watson 1982 ) .    our knowledge of carbon ( and other species ) rrls is currently relatively limited , and lwa1 opens up a new venue for observations of these lines",
    ". in particular , the versatile bandwidth and spectral resolution will be essential for successful observations of rrls ( peters  2011 ) .",
    "for example , at frequencies @xmath026  mhz the spectral resolution required to separate between the carbon rrls is @xmath0125  khz ( see fig .",
    "9 ) . at the same time , a large bandwidth is desired since then many lines can be observed at the same time , and the resulting spectra can be folded to search for a possible detection . using three beams at lwa1",
    "we can simultaneously cover about 85 carbon transitions with a 0.5  khz spectral resolution ( 6 km / s ) .",
    "this is straightforward for lwa1 because the native format for data recording is voltage samples , as opposed to spectrometer output ; channelization can be performed in software at any desired frequency resolution .",
    "the 100-m aperture size of lwa1 also offers improved angular resolution over single - dish studies ( erickson et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the first approved rrl observing project ( see table  3 ) includes proof - of - concept observations of the known lines in cas a to work out any necessary calibration and reduction procedures .",
    "once these are established , three targets in the cygnus arm have been selected as suitable places for an initial rrl search .",
    "the three targets are dr21 ( hii region ) , hb21 ( supernova remnant ) and dr4 ( supernova remnant ) , all of which are bright at low radio frequencies and are likely to contain large amounts of ionized or partly ionized gas .",

    "the lwa1 system architecture is shown in figure  [ fsysarch ] .",
    "the array consists of 258 active antenna stands .",
    "all but two of the antennas are located within an ellipse of 100  m ( east  west ) @xmath4 110  m ( north  south ) , with the axial ratio intended to improve beam shape for pointings toward the galactic center , which transits at @xmath19 as seen from the site .",
    "the other two stands are outliers ( one 77 m sw of center , and one 300 m e of center ) used primarily for calibration and diagnostic purposes .",

    "integral to the stand is an `` active balun '' that provides about 35  db of gain to overcome subsequent losses , ensuring that the system temperature is dominated by galactic ( _ not _ internal ) noise , as demonstrated in figure  [ fstd]b .",
    "upon arrival in the shelter , the signal from every antenna is processed by a direct - sampling receiver consisting of an analog receiver , a 12-bit analog - to - digital converter ( a / d ) which samples 196 million samples per second ( msps ) , and subsequent digital processing ( `` dp '' ) ( see figure  [ farxdp]b ) .",
    "this choice of sample rate ensures that strong rfi from the 88108  mhz fm broadcast band aliases onto itself , with no possibility of obscuring spectrum in the 1088  mhz tuning range .",
    "beams are formed using a fully - digital time - domain delay - and - sum architecture , which allows the entire 78  mhz passband associated with each antenna to be processed as a single data stream ( soriano  2011 ) .",
    "delays are implemented in two stages : an integer - sample `` coarse '' delay is applied using a first - in first - out ( fifo ) buffer operating on the a / d output samples , followed by a 28-tap finite impulse response ( fir ) filter that implements an all - pass `` subsample '' delay .",
    "the filter coefficients can be also specified by the user , allowing the implementation of beams with custom shapes and nulls .",
    "the delayed signals are added to the signals from other antennas processed similarly to obtain beams .",
    "four dual - polarization beams are constructed in this fashion , each fully - independent and capable of pointing anywhere in the visible sky .",
    "each beam is subsequently converted to two independent `` tunings '' of up to @xmath1016  mhz bandwidth each , with each tuning having a center frequency independently - selectable from the range 1088  mhz .",

    "it is also possible to transfer data from data recorders directly off - site using the internet ; however the limited data rate of the internet connection to the lwa1 site makes this impractical for observations longer than a few minutes .    independently of beamforming , and",
    "as demonstrated in figures  2 , 3 and 4 , lwa1 is able to coherently capture and record the output of all its a / ds , where each a / d corresponds to one antenna .",
    "this can be done in two distinct modes .",
    "the `` transient buffer  wideband '' ( tbw ) mode allows the raw 12-bit output of the a / ds to be collected continuously , but only for @xmath20  ms at a time , and another 5 minutes is required to write out the captured samples .",
    "the `` transient buffer  narrowband '' ( tbn ) mode , in contrast , allows a single tuning of @xmath21  khz bandwidth to be recorded continuously and indefinitely , resulting in an output data rate of @xmath0112  mb / s for the array .",
    "these two modes share the same 10  gb / s ethernet output from dp , and thus are mutually exclusive .",
    "however , the tbw / tbn output is distinct from the four beam outputs and runs simultaneously with all four beams using a dedicated ( fifth ) data recorder and drsus .",
    "although intended originally to support commissioning and diagnostic functions , the tbw and tbn modes have emerged as popular modes for science observations , as indicated in   2 .",
    "lwa1 includes a dedicated backend known as the prototype all - sky imager ( pasi ) .",
    "pasi shares the tbn / tbw output and operates @xmath080% of the observatory uptime .",

    "separate from lwa1 , we have built the lwa north arm stub station ( lwana ) , a separate station located at the end of the vla s north arm ( approximately 19  km north of lwa1 ) primarily using spares left over from the original procurements of components for lwa1 .",
    "lwana consists of 20 stands ( thus , @xmath22% of the collecting area of lwa1 ) and is capable of tbw and tbn only ( not beamforming ) .",

    "* radio frequency interference ( rfi ) environment : * as demonstrated in figures [ fig : dipole_drift ] , [ fig : tbw ] , [ fig : deep ] , and [ fstd]b , the rfi environment at lwa1 is surprisingly benign . the observatory management team has had extensive experience  and consistent success  observing at these frequencies at this site using lwa1 , a precursor system ( lwda ; lazio  2010 ) , and the vla 4-m system ( kassim  2007a ) . this is not to say that observing in 1088  mhz is without challenges .",
    "rfi impacts lwa1 on two levels : first , by creating a potential threat to the linearity of the active antennas and analog receivers ; and second , by obstructing spectrum of interest .",
    "we consider the linearity issue first . at lwa1 , the most troublesome interference is due to distant transmitters at frequencies below about 30  mhz , whose signals arrive at the station by refraction from the ionosphere , followed closely by fm broadcast signals in the 88108  mhz range .",
    "these linearity challenges are met using high - intercept point active front end electronics in which we have great confidence ( the same design with only minor modifications has been in nearly continuous use at the site since 2006 ) .",
    "also the lwa1 analog receivers ( fig .",
    "[ farxdp]a ) can be electronically reconfigured between three modes : a full - bandwidth ( 1088  mhz ) uniform gain mode , a full - bandwidth dual - gain mode in which frequencies below about 40  mhz can be attenuated using a `` shelf filter '' ( useful for observing above 40  mhz during that part of the day when long - range signals in the 1030  mhz band are strongest ) ; and a 2854  mhz mode , which would serve as a last line of defense should we find in the future that rfi above and/or below this range becomes persistently linearity - limiting .",
    "in addition , the total gain in each bandpass mode can be adjusted over a 60  db range in 2  db steps , allowing fine adjustments to optimize the sensitivity - linearity tradeoff .",
    "concerning the obscuration of science signals from in - band rfi : our extensive experience in this frequency range ( from the 74  mhz vla system , from lwda and eta , and from lwa1 itself ) has demonstrated that rfi from both external and internal sources will inevitably be present at all levels and throughout the spectrum .",
    "we occasionally encounter bouts of crippling interference , which we inevitably find to be internally generated , from local powerlines , or due to activity at the nearby vla facilities . in each case",
    "we have ( with the excellent cooperation from the vla rfi management team ) quickly identified and eliminated the source . for the remaining low - level rfi , we find that the simple time & frequency editing techniques currently employed are effective in dealing with interference encountered most of the time .",
    "in fact , we typically find that the primary difficulty posed by rfi is not really that it prevents science , but rather that it increases the amount of manual effort required to reduce data , and decreases somewhat the amount of data that is ultimately useful .",
    "we plan a continuing program of technical development aimed at characterizing , expanding and improving the capabilities of lwa1 and , in the process , training students in the art of instrument development and developing the engineering expertise needed to tackle the next generation of large meter - wavelength radio telescopes .",
    "the lwana ( see   3 ) is available as a testbed for technical development projects , so that work can proceed with less concern about inadvertently degrading lwa1 with unproven modifications , or limiting its availability to accommodate testing .",
    "technical developments planned include : ( 1 ) on - the - fly data processing using the existing data recorders ; ( 2 ) flexible scheduling , triggering , and rescheduling of observations ; ( 3 ) enhanced and automated techniques for mitigation of rfi ; ( 4 ) beams with custom shapes and/or optimized sensitivity ; and ( 5 ) improved sidelobe and polarization characterization .",
    "lwa1 observing time is allocated in units of `` beam - hours '' and `` tb - hours '' .",
    "one beam - hour corresponds to the dedicated use of one of lwa1 s four independently - steerable beams for one hour .",
    "similarly , one tb - hour corresponds to the dedicated use of lwa1 s tbw / tbn mode for one hour .",
    "data will be shipped to users on hard drives , or made available on - line through the lwa data archive ( lda ) , a 24 tb on - line archive hosted at unm s center for advanced research in computing .",
    "the first lwa1 cfp was conducted in october 2009 , and resulted in the time allocations identified in table  3 .",
    "cfps will be issued twice annually .",
    "lwa1 also supports `` target of opportunity '' observing .",
    "the director ( or in his absence , the associate director or chief scientist ) is authorized to grant up to 16 beam - hours ( sufficient to cover the full tuning range of lwa1 continuously for one pointing , for 4 hours ) and 8 tb - hours in response to a well - justified email request from anyone .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the lda will provide , in effect , a retroactive observing capability that we will also make available to the community .",
    "the lwa project has developed a suite of software tools for the scheduling and analysis of lwa data ( the lwa software library  lsl , dowell et al .",
    "2012 ; and see ) , but we do not have the resources to provide turn - key software solutions for all experiments that could be envisaged .",
    "we have established a clearinghouse for lwa software and this will be available to all users .",

    "currently lsl includes readers for all lwa observing modes , correlators for the tbw and tbn dipole modes , and various scripts to generate plots of antenna locations , spectra , spectrograms , and more .",
    "lsl is publicly available from the lwa web pages .",
    "lwa1 offers considerable sensitivity and sky coverage in the relatively unexplored frequency range 10  88 mhz .",
    "lwa1 is particularly interesting from an education perspective in that the tbn / tbw modes provide one of the first `` large - n '' radio telescopes , challenging existing algorithms .",
