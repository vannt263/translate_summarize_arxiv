    "to avoid cluttering the figure , this uncertainty is not denoted in figure  [ figure : sfr_lmol ] itself , though will be discussed later when we provide a quantitative mapping between the schmidt and kennicutt - schmidt indices .",
    "the bulk of the arguments made in this paper are summarised in this figure .",
    "first , we see that co ( j=1 - 0 ) generally serves a good tracer of the h@xmath47  molecular gas , and that the  relationship maps reasonably well from the underlying sfr-@xmath48 relation .",
    "this is because co ( j=1 - 0 ) has a relatively low critical density @xcite , and most of the molecular gas emits the j=1 - 0 line . while co ( j=1 - 0 ) is typically optically thick _ within _",
    "gmcs , owing to large velocity gradients it is optically thin on galaxy - wide scales .",
    "thus so long as gmc properties do not vary strongly from galaxy to galaxy ( as local measurements suggest ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their mass and radius distributions are relatively narrow , then an increase in  surface density will correspond to an increase in the number of gmcs , and a commensurate increase in co ( j=1 - 0 )  emission .",
    "for this reason , the  relation serves as a reasonably good proxy for the schmidt relation .",
    "the situation is different for higher excitation co emission lines ( e.g. co j=3 - 2 ) .",
    "higher lying lines have relatively high critical densities . for example , the co ( j=3 - 2 ) line requires typical densities of @xmath49  to excite the line . because of this , these lines are typically subthermal even in the most luminous high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the most heavily star - forming ( densest ) galaxies will have a higher ( e.g. ) co j=3 - 2/co j=1 - 0 ratio than the lowest sfr galaxies . then , because the sfr - co ( j=1 - 0 ) relationship traces the underlying schmidt index , @xmath1 , the observed ( e.g. ) sfr - co ( 3 - 2)@xmath52 relation for higher lying lines will necessarily have a _ flatter _",

    "this trend will become more pronounced as one observes increasingly higher co ( or any molecular ) transitions with higher critical densities .",

    "the uncertainty is determined by characterising the dependence of @xmath0 on the input parameters .",

    ", large deviations from galaxies of this sort may change the observed mapping from a schmidt relation to a ks relation .",

    "it is not entirely clear , in these starburst galaxies , whether the density distribution is similar in shape to those in normal discs ( e.g. with a high - density tail ) , or whether they have a substantially different gas density distribution .",
    "resolved maps of gmcs in local ulirgs with alma will help to answer this question .",
    "finally , we note that galaxies at high-  may have a larger fraction of their gas in a dense phase than local galaxies .",
    "this is explicitly accounted for in our modeling . as described in @xcite ,",
    "clouds are randomly drawn from the mass spectrum to fill cells of a given mass until the mass - budget is used . when the density in a particular region is high ( as informed by the hydrodynamic models ) , more high - mass clouds will statistically be drawn , thus increasing the dense gas fraction .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the effects of radiative transfer on scales below our cell - sizes are only marginally accounted for in these models .",
    "when a photon is emitted , it sees a column density drawn randomly from the distribution of columns seen in the cell @xcite , and deposits some intensity .",
    "however , because the velocity distribution is not modeled on sub - grid scales , this is a limiting assumption .",
    "some of this radiation may actually emerge from the cell owing to large velocity gradients within a cell which may keep photons from being trapped .",
    "efforts are underway to explicitly account for this effect , though it is a task well outside the scope of this study .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : indices ]    the principle result of this study is that , due to subthermal excitation in high - lying co lines in high-  galaxies , observed  relations do not necessarily map linearly to  relations .",
    "this is part of a broader theoretical framework first developed by @xcite and @xcite which posits that the underlying density distribution of galaxies is crucial in mapping the underlying schmidt relation to observed molecular kennicutt - schmidt relations . in this paper , we have expanded upon these studies by exploring the relationship between schmidt and kennicutt - schmidt indices in models which aim to serve as reasonable representations of the 2 star - forming disc galaxies being uncovered in sensitive optical / nir observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the models studied here have been shown in previous publications to satisfy the star - forming _ bzk _ colour - selection criteria @xcite , as well as serve as reasonable progenitors for luminous , merger - driven 2 submillimetre and 24 -selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "we have additionally explored the dependence of the observed molecular kennicutt - schmidt index on varying underlying schmidt relations .",
    "our models , combined with the general theoretical framework of @xcite and @xcite suggest that observed 2 discs are subject to differential co excitation with respect to sfr , and that the observed and  relations may map to an underlying schmidt index of @xmath18 controlling the sfr .",
    "an important verifying aspect to these models is that they are able to explain the multitude of observed sfr-  relations in the local universe .",
    "for example , a linear relationship has been observed between sfr and hcn ( j=1 - 0 ) in local galaxies , a trend which has often been interpreted as evidence that a linear _ dense gas _ schmidt relation controlled the sfr .",
    "our models suggest the linear sfr - hcn ( j=1 - 0 ) relation is in reality a combined effect of an underlying  index of @xmath18 and differential excitation in hcn @xcite . this view has been observationally confirmed by @xcite , who showed that local galaxies exhibit an _",
    "sfr - hcn ( j=3 - 2 ) relation , and thus follow the trend of decreasing sfr - hcn@xmath50 index with increasing transition number characteristic of these models ( e.g. figure  [ figure : sfr_lmol ] ; see also figure 7 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , this model satisfies the multi - line constraints of local co observations .",
    "the sfr - co ( j=1 - 0 ) relation in local galaxies appears to have an index ranging from @xmath68 . at higher - lying transitions ( e.g. co j=3 - 2 )",
    ", the index drops to @xmath69 , in accordance with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "we note that at lower bolometric luminosities , even the sfr - co ( j=1 - 0 ) relation may be subject to differential excitation and serve as a relatively poor tracer of the underlying schmidt relation .    finally , with an eye toward alma , we comment on the role of spatial resolution in observational determinations of the ks relation at high- .",
    "the exact mapping between the observed  index , @xmath0 , and the  index , @xmath1 , depends on the level of thermalisation of the gas within the beam .",
    "it is dependent ( to first order ) on the mean gas density .",
    "higher resolution observations which probe just the nucleus of the galaxy will probe higher mean densities , and allow even higher - lying co emission lines to directly trace the underlying schmidt sfr relation .",
    "indeed , some very tentative observational evidence for this trend in local galaxies has been shown by @xcite .",
    "the trends shown in figures  [ figure : sfr_lmol ] and [ figure : ks_molslope ] are for the central 6 kpc of the galaxy , comparable to the typical resolution of current interferometric observations of 2 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our models suggest that observations of the central @xmath302 kpc will probe sufficiently dense gas that the observed  index , @xmath0 , will trace the underlying  index , @xmath1 .",
    "current facilities demand that observations of the molecular kennicutt - schmidt relation at 2 probe highly excited co lines ( e.g. co j=3 - 2 ) .",
    "however it is not clear how exactly to map observed  relations to underlying  relations : differential excitation of co with sfr may make interpretation difficult .    in order to aid in the interpretation of observed molecular kennicutt - schmidt relations ,",
    "we have calculated the first models of co excitation for star - forming disc galaxies at 2 .",
    "our main results are :    1 .   due to differential excitation of co with sfr in 2 disc galaxies , global observations of a ( e.g. )",
    "relation will result in a _ flatter _ index , @xmath0 , than the underlying schmidt ( ) index , @xmath1 .",
    "this trend exists for all lines above co ( j=1 - 0 ) , though the disparity between @xmath0 and @xmath1 grows with increasingly high co transitions owing to increasing critical densities in the line . 2 .",
    "we present a mapping from observed  indices , @xmath0 , to underlying schmidt indices , @xmath1 for global observations of 2 discs . combining these model results with the observed ( nearly ) linear relationship between @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "suggests that a relation sfr @xmath72 may control the sfr in 2 galaxies .",
