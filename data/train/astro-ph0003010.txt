    "this paper is the second in a series about the study of lithium and rotation in evolved stars based on both new high resolution spectroscopic observations and precise rotational velocities obtained with the coravel spectrometer . in lbre _",
    "( 1999 , hereafter paper i ) we derived lithium abundances by spectral synthesis analysis and presented the observational data for a large and homogeneous sample of f , g , and k - type population i subgiant stars . on the basis of this uniform data set , we could confirm the occurrence of the rotational discontinuity near the spectral type f8iv ( gray & nagar 1985 , de medeiros & mayor 1989 , 1990 ) , and localize a lithium drop - off around the spectral type g2iv .",
    "no clear correlation appeared between the lithium abundance and the rotational velocity ( see also de medeiros _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the physical processes that underline the lithium and rotational discontinuities along the subgiant branch . for this purpose",
    "we first determine the evolutionary status and individual masses of our sample stars by using the hipparcos parallaxes and by comparing the observational hertzsprung - russell diagram with evolutionary tracks computed with the toulouse - geneva code (  2 ) .",
    "this allows us to study very precisely the behaviour of the lithium abundance and of the rotational velocity as a function of effective temperature , stellar mass , metallicity and evolutionary stage .",
    "the lithium main features are discussed in  3 where we compare the observations with theoretical predictions related to the dilution mechanism ( iben 1967a , b ) .",
    "finally , the connection between the observed rotation behaviour and the magnetic braking due to the deepening of the convective envelope ( gray 1981 , gray & nagar 1985 ) is quantified in  4 .",

    "our analysis is based on the observational data from paper  i. this sample is composed of 120 pop  i subgiant stars with f , g and k spectral types which belong to the  catalogue of rotational and radial velocities for evolved stars \" ( de medeiros & mayor 1999 ) , as well as to the bright star catalogue ( hoffleit and jaschek 1982 ) .",
    "we thus use the rotational velocities given in paper  i , as well as the values derived for , and with their respective errors .      0.1 in    in order to interpret accurately the observations , we need to know the mass and the evolutionary stage of the sample stars .",
    "we use the hipparcos ( esa 1997 ) trigonometric parallax measurements to locate precisely our objects in the hr diagram . among our 120 stars , only one object ( hd  144071 ) has no available hipparcos parallax and is thus rejected from further analysis .",
    "intrinsic absolute magnitudes m@xmath9 are derived from the parallaxes and the m@xmath9 magnitudes given by hipparcos .",
    "we determine the bolometric corrections @xmath10 by using the buser and kurucz s relation ( 1992 ) between @xmath10 and v - i ( again taken from the hipparcos catalogue ) . finally , we compute the stellar luminosity and the associated error from the sigma error on the parallax .",
    "the uncertainties in luminosity lower than @xmath11 have an influence of @xmath12 in the determination of the masses .",
    "we show the results of these determinations in fig .",

    "this table displays the stellar masses and luminosities derived for all objects of our sample .",
    "moreover complementary data used for the present analysis ( _ vsini _ , , , [ fe / h ] and ) can be found in papier i ( see tables 1 to 3 ) .",
    "the error adopted on t@xmath13 ( @xmath14k ) is typical for this class of stars , as already discussed in paper  i.    we have computed evolutionary tracks with the toulouse - geneva code for a range of stellar masses between 1 and 4 m@xmath15 and for different metallicities consistent with the range of our sample stars ( see paper i ) .",
    "however , solar composition being relevant to most of the objects of our sample ( about 65% ) , only tracks computed with [ fe / h]=0 will be displayed in the figures .",
    "the evolution was followed from the hayashi fully convective configuration .",
    "we used the radiative opacities by iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) , completed with the atomic and molecular opacities by alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) .",
    "the nuclear reactions are from caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) and the screening factors are included according to the prescription by graboske _",
    "no transport processes except for the classical convective mixing ( with a value of 1.6 for the mixing length parameter ) are taken into account .      in fig .",
    "[ toa ] we compare the observational hr diagram with the evolutionary tracks computed with [ fe / h ] = 0 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the evolutionary point where the subgiant branch starts and which corresponds to the hydrogen exhaustion in the stellar central regions ( i.e. , turnoff point ) .",
    "about 30 stars are located below the turnoff line and therefore appear to be genuine dwarfs , although classified as subgiants in the bright star catalogue . on the other hand ,",

    "first of all , one observes that all the subgiant stars with mass lower than about 1.2  m@xmath15 present _ vsini _ values lower than 10.0  .",
    "observations in young galactic clusters ( see gaig 1993 and references therein ) show that these low - mass stars actually acquire a slow rotation early on the main sequence , as explained by the magnetic braking scenario for main sequence stars ( kraft 1967 , schrijver and pols 1993 ) .    before the rotational discontinuity , the subgiants with mass",
    "larger than 1.2  m@xmath15 present a broad range of _ vsini _ values .",
    "because their very thin surface convective envelopes are not an efficient site for magnetic field generation via a dynamo process , these stars are not expected to experience significant angular momentum loss during their main sequence evolution .",

    "[ tb1 ] ( see also fig .  [ bottomb ] ) , the effective temperature at which the convective envelope starts to deepen ( t@xmath35 ) depends slightly on the stellar mass .",
    "we also give the depth of the convective envelope at the effective temperature of the rotational discontinuity , m@xmath36 .",
    "for the masses lower than 2.0 m@xmath15 , the observed rotation discontinuity occurs just when the convective envelope starts deepening .",
    "we thus see that if the magnetic braking plays a relevant role in the rotational discontinuity , it requires only a very small change in the mass of the convective envelope . above 2.0  m@xmath15 ,",
    "our sample is very sparse ( due in particular to the very rapid evolution of such stars in the hertzsprung gap ) and we have no data for single stars on the left of the rotation discontinuity exhibited by lower stellar masses .",
    "we can not thus discuss further the impact of the deepening of the convective envelope on the braking in these more massive stars .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the li and rotation observations for 120 subgiant stars from lbre _ et al . _",
    "we used the hipparcos trigonometric parallax measurements to locate precisely our objects in the hr diagram and to determine the individual mass and evolutionary status for all stars in the sample .",
    "we have compared observed li abundances with predictions of li dilution caused by the deepening of the convective envelope on the subgiant branch .",
    "our models show that the beginning of the theoretical lithium dilution is a function of stellar mass and coincides with the observational features .",
    "stars with masses @xmath29 1.2  m@xmath15 show a large range in abundance before the turnoff , indicating lithium depletion in the previous phases .",
    "stars with masses between 1.2 and 1.5  m@xmath15 ( i.e. , in the dip region ) show values in agreement with what is found in the open clusters .",
    "we note that many stars with masses higher than 1.5  m@xmath15 show lithium depletion up to two orders of magnitude before the start of the dilution at log t@xmath31 .",
    "the process that depletes li in these objects while on the main sequence should however preserve the boron abundance , which is in agreement with the standard dilution predictions in the underabundant li giants of the hyades , as shown recently by duncan _",
    "because these specie burn at different depths than lithium , future observations of boron for our sample will provide powerful additional constraints and will confirm the similarity between field and cluster evolved stars .",
    "our analysis confirms that low mass stars leave the main sequence with a low rotational rate , while more massive stars are slowed only when reaching the subgiant branch .",
    "a very slight increase of the depth of the convective envelope seems to be sufficient for the magnetic braking to take place at this phase .",
    "even if the decrease in the behavior of lithium is nearly the rotational discontinuity , our interpretation of the observations shows that lithium and rotation discontinuities are independent .",

    "<S> we look at the distributions of and _ vsini _ with mass when stars evolve from the main sequence to the subgiant branch .    for most of the stars in our sample we find good agreement with the dilution predictions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the more massive cool stars with upper limits of li abundances show a significant discrepancy with the theoretical predictions , even if the non - lte effects are taken into account . for the rotation behaviour </S>",
    "<S> , our analysis confirms that low mass stars leave the main sequence with a low rotational rate , while more massive stars are slowed down only when reaching the subgiant branch . </S>",
    "<S> we also checked the connection between the observed rotation behaviour and the magnetic braking due to the deepening of the convective envelope . </S>",
    "<S> our results shed new light on the lithium and rotation discontinuities in the evolved phase .    </S>",
