    "the possibility of creating photons out of vacuum fluctuations of the quantized electromagnetic field in dynamical cavities , the so - called dynamical casimir effect ( see @xcite for a review ) , demonstrates the highly non - trivial nature of the quantum vacuum .    a scenario of particular interest",
    "are so - called vibrating cavities @xcite where the distance between two parallel ( ideal ) mirrors changes periodically in time .",
    "the occurrence of resonance effects between the mechanical motion of the mirror and the quantum vacuum leading to ( even exponentially ) increasing occupation numbers in the resonance modes makes this configuration the most promising candidate for an experimental verification of this pure quantum effect .",
    "particle creation in one - dimensional vibrating cavities has been studied in numerous works @xcite . when considering small amplitude oscillations , analytical results can be deduced showing that under resonance conditions the particle occupation numbers increase quadratically in time .",
    "particle creation due to off - resonant wall motions has been investigated in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the energy density in a one - dimensional cavity with one vibrating wall has also been studied by many authors @xcite demonstrating that the total energy inside a resonantly vibrating cavity grows exponentially in time ( see also @xcite ) while the total particle number increases only quadratically .",
    "thus a pumping of energy into higher frequency modes takes place and particles of frequencies exceeding the mechanical frequency of the oscillating mirror are created .",
    "the energy for this process is provided by the energy which has to be given to the system from outside to maintain the motion of the mirror against the radiation reaction force @xcite .",
    "the more realistic case of a three - dimensional cavity is studied in @xcite .",
    "field quantization inside cavities with non - perfect boundary conditions has been investigated in , e.g. , @xcite and corrections due to finite temperature effects are treated in @xcite .",
    "the question of how the quantum vacuum interacts with the ( classical ) dynamics of the cavity has been addressed in @xcite .    in this work we present a formalism allowing for numerical investigation of the dynamical casimir effect for scalar particles in a one - dimensional cavity .",
    "( for related numerical work see also @xcite . )",
    "we introduce a particular parametrization for the time evolution of the field modes yielding a system of coupled first - order differential equations .",
    "the solutions to this system determine the number of created particles and can be obtained by means of standard numerics .",
    "we employ the formalism to investigate the creation of real massless scalar particles in a resonantly as well as off - resonantly vibrating cavity and compare the numerical results with analytical predictions .",
    "these results are complementary to the ones already presented in @xcite .    with this formalism at hand",
    "the dynamical casimir effect can be investigated fully numerically making it possible to study a variety of scenarios where no analytical results are known ( large amplitude oscillations , arbitrary wall motions etc . ) .",
    "of special interest is of course the realistic case of the electromagnetic field in a three - dimensional cavity .",
    "being easily extendable to arbitrary space dimensions the presented formalism can be used also in this case . in particular",
    "it allows to calculate numerically the te - mode contribution @xcite to the photon creation taking the influence of the intermode coupling fully into account @xcite .",
    "hence the formalism can be used to cross - check analytical results also in this realistic case which might be of importance for future experiments .",
