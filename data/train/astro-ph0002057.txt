    "the disk of the milky way is remarkably flat out to 10 kpc , where it starts to bends in opposite directions in the southern and northern parts .",
    "the cause of it is still a puzzle : for a review , see binney .",
    "one possibility is that the magellanic clouds distort the galactic disk in the observed way .",
    "the fact that the direction of the maximum warping lies very close to the galactocentric longitude of the clouds makes this hypothesis tempting .",
    "the problem with this scenario is that the clouds are not massive enough to generate the warp amplitudes that we observe at their present distance .",
    "this was noticed by the first researches in this field @xcite , and later by hunter & toomre ( 1969 ) . a remedy which might allow this scenario to work was to suppose that the clouds are currently not at the pericenter of their orbit , so that they have been much closer to the galactic disk in a previous epoch ( @xmath0 kpc is what was needed ) .",
    "however , later work by murai & fujimoto ( 1986 ) determined the orbit of the clouds , and proved that the clouds are actually at their pericenter , with an apocenter close to 100 kpc , so the problem of the small amplitude still remains if the clouds are to be blamed as the cause of the galactic warp .",
    "recently a mechanism for amplifying the effect of a satellite has been proposed by weinberg .",
    "he describes a calculation in which a disk galaxy surrounded by a dark halo is perturbed by a massive satellite , similar to the lmc . by means of a linear perturbation analysis",
    ", he follows the perturbation ( wake ) created by the satellite in the halo , including its self - gravity .",
    "he finds that the torque exerted on the disk is several times larger than that due directly to the satellite : the latter is amplified because ( i ) the satellite - induced wake in the halo itself exerts a torque , roughly in phase with that from the satellite ; and ( ii ) the wake itself further perturbs the halo , resulting in a torque that is larger again . under circumstances in which the satellite orbital frequency is close to the natural precession frequency of the disk ( i.e. , the warp mode frequency of sparke & casertano ) , a significant amplitude can result .",
    "a calculation by lynden - bell of a similar scenario gives comparable results , as does a simple model described by kuijken .    in this paper , we focus on the orientation of a warp generated by a massive orbiting satellite with less emphasis on the amplitude of the warp . in ",
    "2 we discuss a simple analytic model in which the disk and halo are rigid : this establishes the baseline response of a disk to satellite tides , and its orientation with respect to the satellite orbital plane .",
    "as we show , this orientation is different from that of the galactic warp to the lmc orbit .  3",
    "contains a description of the n - body code used , and  4 to  6 the results of our n - body simulations , showing that the orientation problem remains . in ",
    "7 we give our conclusions .",
    "a simple model serves as a reference for the warp response of the disk to an orbiting satellite . consider a rigid disk , embedded in a rigid halo potential , and subjected to the potential of an orbiting satellite .",
    "the evolution of the disk is governed by the combined torque from halo and satellite .",
    "a stellar or gaseous disk is floppy , and so will warp when tilted , since it is not able to generate the stresses that would be required to keep it flat ; however the overall re - alignment of the disk angular momentum should be comparable between the rigid and floppy cases .",
    "the angles used in this paper related to the satellite , and the definition of our coordinate system are illustrated in figure  [ fig : coord ] .",
    "the tilting of the disk is measured by the angle between the @xmath1 axis and the angular momentum of the disk .",
    "the longitude of this vector is the same as the longitude of the maximum of the warp when looking at the disk from the north galactic pole .",
    "= 1.0    the lagrangian for a rigidly spinning , axisymmetric object is    @xmath2    where @xmath3 are the euler angles , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the moments of inertia of the object about its symmetry axis and about orthogonal directions .",
    "@xmath6 is the potential energy of the body in the halo plus satellite potential .",
    "the @xmath7-equation of motion leads to the conserved quantity @xmath8 , the spin , and the other two equations of motion then become @xmath9 and @xmath10 for small deviations from the equator ( @xmath11 ) , we can expand these equations in terms of @xmath12 , @xmath13 . in these terms the equations of motion become @xmath14 @xmath15 for small @xmath16 , the potential energy of the disk due to the flattened halo will have the form @xmath17 , and that due to the satellite at position @xmath18 will be @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants representing the strengths of the halo torque and of the quadrupole of the tidal field from the satellite , respectively . hence we find @xmath22 @xmath23 if furthermore the satellite orbit is circular and polar in the @xmath24 plane , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the solution to the equations of motion is @xmath27 plus free precession and nutation terms , where @xmath28 .",
    "( a more general quasiperiodic satellite orbit yields a solution which can be written as a sum of such terms . )",
    "notice that the satellite provokes an elliptical precession about the halo symmetry axis , with axis ratio dependent on the halo flattening and on the satellite orbit frequency .",
    "for example , for an exponential disk of mass @xmath29 , scale length @xmath30 and with a flat rotation curve of amplitude @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for such a disk in a spherical ( or absent ) halo ( @xmath34 ) , a satellite orbiting at radius @xmath35 has frequency @xmath36 , and hence the axis ratio of the forced precession is @xmath37 . hence the response of the disk to a distant satellite is mainly to nod perpendicular to the satellite orbit plane .",
    "this result can be understood as the classic orthogonal response of a gyroscope to an external torque : a distant satellite has a sufficiently low orbital frequency that the disk responds as if the torque were static .    for a slightly flattened potential of the form",
    "@xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39 . with non - zero @xmath40 ,",
    "the axis ratio of the precession cone becomes @xmath41 $ ] : again the oscillation in @xmath42 is larger than that in @xmath43 except for very flattened halos .",
    "the amplitudes generated by tidal perturbation from a satellite such as the lmc are small , less than a degree .",
    "the largest amplitude of oscillation is in the @xmath43-direction .",
    "the potential energy of the disk due to the tidal field of the satellite can be shown to be ( see appendix ) @xmath44 hence equation  [ eq : rigidsol ] yields , to leading order in @xmath45 , an @xmath42-amplitude of @xmath46 for the lmc ( orbital radius about @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ) .",
    "this number increases only slightly ( a factor 2 ) for halo flattenings up to 0.2 ( see figure  [ fig : rigidtilt ] ) .",
    "= 1.0    it is clear from this calculation that simple tidal tilting of a disk by an lmc - like satellite does not provide a good model for the warping in the galaxy , because the orientation of the warp is not perpendicular to the orbital plane of the lmc .",
    "this constraint is independent of the strength of the perturbation @xmath21 .",
    "the amplitudes are much too small , but we have only considered the tilting of a rigid disk , and the situation can change when the floppiness of the disk is considered .",
    "to test this scenario , and in particular to get beyond the rigid tilting considered above , we have performed some n - body simulations .",
    "we assume the halo to be a background potential which does not respond to the disk or the satellite .",
    "the n - body code used for this work models the disk as a set of concentric spinning rings embedded in a spherical , rigid halo .",
    "this description allows warps to be described , but not in - plane distortions of the disk such as bars or lopsidedness .",
    "we have performed simulations with two types of disks : a rigid disk and a exponential disk .",
    "the rigid disk run tells us how good the analytic predictions are , and the exponential disk is used later for a more realistic approach .",
    "we use a king model for the halo , in order to obtain a reasonable flat rotation curve ( figure  [ fig : rc ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished with a model of @xmath49 , a tidal radius of 44 ( 200 kpc . for a 4.5 kpc scale - length disk ) , and mass of 10 disk masses .",
    "each of the disks is made of 1000 rings , each of them consisting of 36 particles .",
    "various runs where made with more rings and more particles per ring , without important changes in the results described below .",
    "= 1.0    the satellite is modelled as having a plummer distribution . to avoid relative movements of the galaxy with respect to the satellite we have used two satellites instead of one , symmetrically placed with respect to the centre of the halo - disk system .",
    "this causes the dipole term of the tidal field to be zero , avoiding relative movements of the galaxy with respect to the satellites .",
    "it is equivalent to only keeping the even-@xmath50 terms in the potential of the satellite , neglecting the dipole , @xmath51 , terms in the potential , and concentrating on the warp ( which result from the quadrupole , @xmath52 terms ) .",
    "the first run was made with a satellite in a circular orbit , to try to reproduce the predictions in  2 .",
    "later a non - circular orbit is considered , and the difference between both simulations analysed . the non - circular orbit has a pericenter at 50 kpc and apocenter at 100 kpc , consistent with recent determination of the orbit of the clouds @xcite . in the non - circular simulations the satellite starts at its apocenter at the beginning of the simulation , where the perturbation on the disk is the smallest possible .",
    "the units of the model translate to the galaxy ( disk scale - length @xmath53 , and the rotation velocity at @xmath54 of @xmath55 ) as follows : length unit = @xmath53 , velocity unit = 340 @xmath56 , time unit = @xmath57years , mass unit= @xmath58 . with these numbers , the disk mass of our model is @xmath59 , and the satellite ( lmc ) has a mass of @xmath60 , the biggest current mass estimate for the clouds @xcite . in the coordinate system of the simulations ,",
    "the @xmath61 is the disk plane , and the orbit of the satellite lies in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "the disk is modelled as a system of pivoted spinning rings , fixed at the centre of the halo .",
    "each ring is realized as 36 azimuthally - spaced particles , and the potential generated by the rings is calculated with a tree code @xcite .",
    "the forces on the individual `` ring - particles '' are used to calculate the torque on each ring . the force exerted by a satellite on the ring particles",
    "was evaluated directly using the plummer law .",
    "the euler equations for rings and axisymmetric bodies can be rewritten in a form so that the time derivatives of the instantaneous angular velocities about the body axes are linear combinations of the angular velocities , torques and body normal vector components .",
    "this allows the derivation of a second order explicit time - centred leapfrog integration scheme that can be used to solve the coupled equations for the rings and make it easy to merge with an n - body code @xcite .",
    "as a first approach , we have evolved a rigid disk and analysed its evolution under the influence of an orbiting satellite .",
    "the result of our simulation is in good agreement with the analytic predictions .",
    "the disk wobbles under the influence of the satellite , describing an ellipse elongated in the direction perpendicular to the satellite s orbital plane .",
    "the path followed by the disk is plotted in figure  [ fig : rigidrun ] , where it can be seen that most of the time the maximum of the warp is located in the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane of the satellite ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the ellipse is nt as regular as in figure  [ fig : rigidtilt ] for two reasons : the assumption that the disk is much smaller than the orbital radius of the satellite is not completely fulfilled ; and there are some transient terms present because of the initial conditions of the simulation .",
    "this are also the cause for the precession ellipse of the disk not to be centred in the origin .",
    "the position of the warp when the satellite is at the location of the lmc is indicated by the dots in figure  [ fig : rigidrun ] , and the location of them resembles the predicted one in figure  [ fig : rigidtilt ] ( for @xmath64 ) remarkably well .",
    "we now consider a more realistic disk : an exponential disk model , in which we have considered also the disk s self - gravity .",
    "the first thing that draws our attention in this simulation is a peak we see in the inclination at around 6.5 scale - lengths .",
    "simulations done with a different rotation curve showed that this peak occurs at the locations on the disk that satisfy @xmath65 , that are caused by resonances with the satellite s orbital frequency .",
    "this happens because the non - linear behaviour of the outer parts of the disk , where the assumption @xmath66 is worse than it is further in .",
    "this is not the kind of warp we are looking for , due to the fact that it is the result of a satellite with a single frequency , and in the real case the eccentric orbit of the satellite will wash out this peak . looking at the evolution of the disk",
    "it is clear that the warp looses its coherence at a radius about 4.5 scale - lengths ( at larger radius the line of nodes winds up ) , so we will measure the warp properties considering that the disk finishes there .",
    "= 0.9    in the case of a floppy disk it is not straight - forward to define a single inclination and position angle .",
    "we have separated the disk into two components : the inner disk and the outer ( warped ) disk .",
    "the inner disk consists on the first 2 scale - lengths , and remains practically flat along the simulation .",
    "the warping angle is then calculated as the angle between the inner and outer disk vectors .",
    "we have chosen to use the disk vectors and not the angular momentum , for example , not to penalise the outer less massive rings .",
    "the results presented here do not change significantly when the definition of the inner disk is altered .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that the warping angles quoted here are different than the maximum amplitude of the warp , who usually are larger by a factor not greater than 5 .    using this method we obtain a plot similar to figure  [ fig : rigidrun ] for the exponential disk , which is shown in figure  [ fig : exprun ] .",
    "only the path after t=160 is shown , that is the moment when the disk behaviour reaches an equilibrium .",
    "note that the predictions for the galactic warp do nt really change with the floppiness of the disk : it is clearly close to @xmath62 , as chapter  2 predicted , and not at @xmath67 , as we observe it in the galaxy .",
    "we also considered non - circular orbits , to allow for the fact that the orbit derived for the clouds has a pericenter of 50 kpc and an apocenter of 100 kpc @xcite .",
    "the changing radius of the satellite causes a fluctuating tidal field amplitude , which could be important for the dynamics of the disk .",
    "here we show that in fact the effect does not change our conclusions materially .",
    "first , to have an idea of what to expect , we integrated the analytic equations of section  2 with a satellite in this kind of orbit .",
    "the result was , as before , that the disk s precession path was contained within an ellipse , elongated along the direction perpendicular to the satellite s plane .",
    "this causes the warp maxima to be most of the time close to the direction perpendicular to the satellite s orbit .",
    "we then performed simulations with this type of orbits .",
    "the first thing we observe in these simulations is that the resonance peak we found in the circular orbit simulation has disappeared . now",
    "the satellite does nt have a single frequency , so the result is not surprising .",
    "the energy of the resonance gets distributed along different parts of the disk now , and no coherent pattern can be maintained across the disk , winding up the outer parts of the disk . when we look at the inner 4.5 scale - lengths as before , the precession pattern remains similar to the simulation with the circular orbit , so does the prediction of the warp s longitude at lmc s actual orbital phase .",
    "so our conclusions are not modified by the non - circularity of the orbit .",
    "the halos considered in all these simulations are spherical , which means that they do nt contribute to the generation of torques on the disk .",
    "we know that halos are not spherical , which creates a preferred plane in which the disk settles .",
    "ellipticities of the order of 0.05 in the potential make the precession paths described before yet more elongated , which would make the chances of finding the warp maxima in the satellites direction even more unlikely .",
    "we show by means of analytic work and n - body simulations that the precession path of a warp generate by an orbiting satellite galaxy is elongated along the direction perpendicular to the satellite s orbital plane . applying our result to the milky way ,",
    "if the galactic warp is generated by the magellanic clouds , the direction of maximum amplitude of the warp would lie close to @xmath68 , as compared to the observed direction of @xmath69 .",
    "even if the halo s self - gravitating tidal response to the satellite amplifies the effect of the satellite  @xcite , this response will be mostly in phase with the satellite , and the alignment problems will persist .",
    "possibly the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , whose orbit lies at 90@xmath70 to that of the lmc , can be the cause of the warp instead  @xcite .",
    "a limitation of the present work is that the halo has not been considered as a live , self - gravitating component .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the back - reaction of the halo on a re - aligning disk can have important consequences .",
    "such effects will be the subject of a further paper .",
    "the potential energy of an disk of surface density @xmath71 and in the gravitational field due to a satellite at position @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 choosing spherical coordinates for the satellite s position ( see figure  [ fig : coord ] ) , and cartesian coordinates in the disk plane so that the satellite has @xmath24 , we have @xmath74 assuming that the disk is small compared to @xmath35 , we can expand the integrand in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
