    "the charge gap in mott insulators is a consequence of a strong electron correlation represented by a large on - site coulomb interaction .",

    ", an unoccupied site and a doubly occupied site of electrons  can move inside the system without being disturbed by surrounding spins in the background .",
    "this is a manifestation of a separation of the charge and spin degrees of freedom , called the spin - charge separation inherent in 1d correlated electron systems .",
    "optical responses in the 1d mott insulators are characterized by this phenomenon .",
    "@xcite in two - dimensional ( 2d ) mott insulators , on the other hand , the two particles are expected not to be free from the spin degree of freedom , because the propagation of a carrier is known to induce a spin cloud around the carrier as a consequence of the misaligned spins along the carrier - hopping paths .",
    "@xcite such an interplay of spin and charge is also one of main subjects of the study of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "the nature of the two particles in the photoexcited states of the mott insulators is obtained by examining the linear susceptibility @xmath1 with respect to the applied electric field , which provides information on the dipole - allowed states with odd parity among the photoexcited states .",
    "in addition to @xmath1 , the third - order nonlinear optical susceptibility @xmath0 is useful to detect not only the odd - parity states but also the dipole - forbidden states with even parity .",
    "@xcite recently , large values of @xmath0 have been reported for 1d mott insulators of copper oxides such as sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( ref .",
    "9 and 10 ) from an electro - reflectance measurement  @xcite and pump and probe spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite analyses of @xmath0 have suggested that odd- and even - parity states are nearly degenerate with a large transition dipole moment between them .",
    "theoretically , @xmath0 in 1d mott insulators has been examined by employing the numerically exact diagonalization technique for small clusters of the hubbard model at half filling .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that odd- and even - parity states are almost degenerate in the same energy region and that the degeneracy is due to the spin - charge separation and strong on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite from this viewpoint , an effective model that can describe the optical nonlinearity has been proposed ,  @xcite that is , a holon - doublon model , where holon and doublon represent the charge degree of freedom for photoinduced unoccupied and doubly occupied sites , respectively .",
    "the model reproduces very well the characteristic behaviors of the experimental @xmath0 including data from third - harmonic generation ( thg ) spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite    in the 2d mott insulators of copper oxide such as sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 , @xmath0 has been reported to be one order of magnitude smaller than that in 1d .",
    "@xcite theoretical calculations based on the ( extended ) hubbard model have shown such a dimensionality dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite however , a complete understanding of the nonlinear optical responses in 2d mott insulators has not been obtained both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "for instance , thg spectra in 2d have been reported from three groups ,  @xcite but the data have not converged : one of the data in la@xmath2cuo@xmath4 shows several pronounced peak structures in the energy region of 0.6  1.1  ev,@xcite while other data in la@xmath2cuo@xmath4 ( ref .",
    "14 ) and sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 ( ref .",
    "15 ) exhibit a broad structure with a maximum at around 0.7  ev .",
    "although the former data of thg were analyzed by using an excitonic cluster model  @xcite taking into account both copper and oxygen ions , a microscopic description and understanding of photoexcited states in 2d are not complete in terms of the interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "in this paper , we theoretically examine photoexcited states and nonlinear optical responses in the 2d mott insulators .",
    "we use an effective hamiltonian of a half - filled hubbard model in the strong - coupling limit and a numerically exact diagonalization method on finite - size clusters for the calculation of @xmath0 . by using the effective hamiltnian",
    ", we can treat the clusters larger in size than those used in a previous study for the 2d hubbard model in ref .",
    "4 , leading to new insights into the photoexcited states in the 2d mott insulators .",
    "it is found that the edge of the distribution of the even - parity states is located lower in energy than that of the odd - parity states .",
    "this is different from the distribution in 1d , where the edges of both states almost coincide .",
    "the origin is attributed to the presence of an exchange interaction between spins . in other words ,",
    "the spin degree of freedom plays an important role in the photoexcited states . in the thg spectrum ,",
    "dominant contributions come from the process of three - photon resonance associated with the odd - parity states .",
    "the two - photon resonance process is hidden by the dominant contributions .",
    "the spectrum obtained by using realistic parameters for 2d copper oxides thus shows broad maxima coming from three - photon resonance .",
    "such broad spectral features are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental data in refs .",
    "12 and 13 .",
    "we also demonstrate that @xmath0 obtained by a cross - polarized configuration of pump and probe beams shows spectral distributions similar to @xmath0 with a copolarized configuration but with small weight .",
    "these findings will help the analysis of the experimental data of @xmath0 in the 2d mott insulators .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "iii , calculated results of the linear and nonlinear optical responses are presented .",

    "two - photon absorption ( tpa ) and thg spectra are calculated with both copolarized and cross - polarized configurations .",
    "we also compare our results with existing experimental data of @xmath0 .",
    "the summary is given in sec .",

    "the value of the gap is predominantly determined by the energy position of the 2@xmath6 orbitals .",

    "the @xmath181 contribution , on the other hand , should appear around @xmath195 according to the distribution in tpa , but the weight is not enhanced . the total weight is smaller than that of @xmath166 , being similar to the tpa spectra . in order to obtain further insight into the photoexcited states of the 2d mott insulators",
    ", it is desired to measure experimentally the weight and distribution of the cross - polarized tpa and thg and compare them with our results .",
    "we have examined the photoexcited states and nonlinear optical responses in the 2d mott insulators by using an effective model for a single - band hubbard model in the strong - coupling limit . by employing the numerical technique for small clusters ,",
    "we have obtained characteristic features that are consistent with the experimental data of linear absorption and tpa for 2d insulating cuprates .",
    "they are the following:(i ) linear absorption in 2d shows two broad peaks in contrast to a single peak in 1d , ( ii ) the magnitude of the tpa spectrum in 2d is smaller than that in 1d , and ( iii ) in 2d the peak and edge positions of the tpa spectrum are lower than those of linear absorption in contrast to 1d where tpa and linear absorption show almost an identical behavior near the edge .",
    "the interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom plays an essential role in such dimensionality dependence : in the photoexcited states of the 1d mott insulator there is a separation of the two degrees of freedom , while in 2d the charge motion is strongly influenced by the presence of spins in the background .",
    "being consistent with this picture , we found that the features ( i ) and ( iii ) are sensitive to the value of the exchange interactions between spins .    in the thg spectrum of the 2d mott insulators ,",
    "dominant contributions are found to come from the process of three - photon resonance associated with the odd - parity states .",
    "the two - photon resonance process is thus hidden by the dominant contributions .",
    "the spectrum obtained by using realistic parameters for 2d insulating cuprates thus shows broad spectral features , which are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental data with a broad maximum ,  @xcite but not to the data with pronounced peak structures .",
    "@xcite we hope further the experimental efforts to clarify the characteristic of the thg spectrum in 2d .    we have calculated @xmath0 under the cross - polarized configuration of pump and probe beams .",
    "it is shown in both the tpa and thg spectra that the spectral distribution is similar to @xmath0 with copolarized configuration but the weight is small .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 with the cross - polarized configurations are highly desired to obtain deep insight into the nature of photoexcited states in 2d mott insulators .",
