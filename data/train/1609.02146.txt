    "<S> effective theory of the bicritical point : * we first explore universal properties of the continuous dsm - pdw transition ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) via a one - loop rg analysis in @xmath52 spacetime dimensions  @xcite . at this transition , we find that the anisotropy in fermion and boson velocities vanishes , i.e. , @xmath53 and @xmath54 at low energies and long distances . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they flow to a common value @xmath55 in the infrared such that lorentz symmetry emerges at the continuous pdw transition , no matter whether the pdw phase is isotropic or nematic . </S>",
    "<S> even though emergent lorentz symmetry was previously observed at various quantum critical points involving dirac fermions  @xcite , it is more exotic here because it involves an odd number of dirac cones on surfaces of a correlated ti . </S>",
    "<S> this emergent lorentz symmetry allows us to set @xmath56 in discussing the pdw quantum critical points .    from the rg equations for the coupling constants @xmath57  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we find a unique stable fixed point at @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , where the subscript `` @xmath61 '' means  stable \" . at this stable fixed point , the boson potential becomes @xmath62 and has an emergent @xmath63 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , the full theory only has the reduced symmetry @xmath64 due to the finite fermion - boson coupling @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> based on our earlier analysis , the fixed point with @xmath66 corresponds to a bicritical point where three phases ( dsm , ipdw , and npdw ) meet . </S>",
    "<S> however , this multicritical point is a novel one as it has only one relevant direction ( the mass term @xmath67 ) . the term proportional to @xmath68 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ potential ] ) is dangerously irrelevant and ground states on the ordered side crucially depend on its sign .    </S>",
    "<S> * emergent xyz / sqed at the npdw tricritical point : * besides the stable fixed point discussed above , the rg equations also support another ( unstable ) fixed point at @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this fixed point action is invariant under the susy transformations @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are obtained by permutations of @xmath74 , where the infinitesimal transformation parameters @xmath75 are grassmann - valued two - component spinors , and @xmath76 with @xmath77 the identity matrix .    remarkably , this fixed point is described by a new type of susy qualitatively different from all previously predicted in condensed matter . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic pdw fields @xmath78 and dirac fermions @xmath79 combine into three chiral superfields @xmath80 , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a grassmann - valued two - component spinor and @xmath83 are spin indices . </S>",
    "<S> intravalley pairing would have resulted in three decoupled copies of the @xmath1 wess - zumino theory with superpotential @xmath84 studied previously  @xcite . by contrast , in the intervalley pairing scenario considered here the three valleys are strongly coupled via the superpotential @xmath85  @xcite , and the resulting theory is known as the xyz model . </S>",
    "<S> it flows in the infrared to a strongly coupled fixed point , which is dual via mirror symmetry  a susy version of the peskin - dasgupta - halperin or particle - vortex duality  @xcite  to the infrared fixed point of @xmath1 sqed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is a theory of a vector superfield @xmath86 and two chiral superfields @xmath87 , playing the role of gauge field and matter field in the `` vortex '' theory , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to an emergent bosonic gauge field @xmath88 , the vector superfield @xmath86 also contains a fermionic gaugino @xmath89 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now show that the xyz / sqed fixed point with @xmath90 and @xmath91 corresponds to the tricritical point that separates the continuous and first - order transitions into the nematic pdw phase . from the linearized rg equations near the susy fixed point , [ linear ] ( g^2 + u + u + u  ) = ( -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 23 & -53 & 0 & -83 + 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 + 23 & -23 & 0 & 13 ) ( g^2 + u + u + u  ) , where @xmath92 is running parameter , we can obtain the scaling behavior of eigenoperators . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of the matrix in are ( @xmath93,@xmath941,@xmath941,1 ) , where the positive eigenvalue indicates that there is one relevant direction ( besides the relevant direction of @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the xyz / sqed fixed point is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with our mean - field analysis of the tricritical point on the transition boundary between the dsm and npdw phases , which is reached by tuning two parameters .    like the wess - zumino model </S>",
    "<S> , the xyz model enjoys an @xmath95-symmetry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath95-charge of the superpotential @xmath85 should be 2 , i.e. , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 denotes the @xmath95-charge of the superfield @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the assignment of @xmath95-charge for the superfield @xmath98 is simple owing to the rotational symmetry in our case : they should be equal , @xmath99 . for a chiral superfield , scaling dimension </S>",
    "<S> is exactly equal to the @xmath95-charge  @xcite in 2 + 1 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtain the exact scaling dimensions of the bosonic order parameter fluctuations and dirac fermions as @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> setting @xmath102 , our one - loop rg result @xmath103 for the boson scaling dimension is consistent with the exact result , a consequence of susy . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the order parameter anomalous dimension or critical exponent @xmath104 is @xmath105 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the correlation length exponent @xmath106 is related to the scaling dimension of non - chiral fields @xmath107 , and can not be simply related to the @xmath95-charge . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath108 at the level of one - loop rg  @xcite .    * exact optical conductivity at the npdw tricritical point : * owing to the strong constraints imposed by @xmath1 superconformal symmetry at the xyz / sqed fixed point </S>",
    "<S> , many dynamical properties can be obtained exactly  @xcite . according to linear response theory , </S>",
    "<S> the optical conductivity is given by the current - current correlation function , [ kubo ] ( ) = -j_x ( ) j_x(- ) , where @xmath109 is the matsubara frequency and @xmath110 is the quantum of conductance . </S>",
    "<S> the current - current correlation function is highly constrained by conformal symmetry through the conformal ward identity  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now compute the exact optical conductivity at the npdw tricritical point . utilizing the @xmath95-symmetry of @xmath1 superconformal field theories in 2 + 1 dimensions </S>",
    "<S> , one can find  @xcite that @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the optical conductivity at zero temperature and @xmath113 is the dimensionless coefficient of the two - point correlation function of the @xmath95-current  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the zero - temperature optical conductivity @xmath114 is independent of frequency , owing to the conformal symmetry  @xcite . in an @xmath1 susy field theory with only chiral superfields </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath113 is given by an integral that depends only on the @xmath95-charge of the chiral superfields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned before , owing to the c@xmath4 rotational symmetry relating the three chiral superfields @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath115 , @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same as the @xmath95-charge of the chiral superfield in the wess - zumino model  @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath113 at the xyz / sqed fixed point is simply three times that in the wess - zumino model , which was evaluated analytically in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the exact zero - temperature optical conductivity at the nematic pdw tricritical point is thus given by _ 0()=(16- ) 0.681 , which may be tested in future experiments .    * concluding remarks : * we have shown that a novel type of susy emerges at the nematic pdw tricritical point on the surface of a correlated ti that hosts three dirac cones , like smb@xmath0 . at this tricritical point , </S>",
    "<S> the three surface dirac fermions and three complex bosons ( corresponding to pdw order parameter fluctuations ) are described by the so - called xyz model , which is dual in the low - energy and long - wavelength limit to a susy gauge theory , @xmath1 sqed . as such , our result also provides a direct physical setting for the investigation of mirror symmetry in condensed matter systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is an area of increased recent activity  @xcite owing to its connection with a series of recently proposed dualities in 2 + 1 dimensions  @xcite , with applications to a wide range of problems in contemporary condensed matter physics such as the half - filled landau level . </S>",
    "<S> we have predicted critical exponents and the zero - temperature optical conductivity at the nematic pdw tricritical point , which could be tested in future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we hope the present results will stimulate the theoretical and experimental search for various types of emergent susy and , more generally , emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems  @xcite .    </S>",
