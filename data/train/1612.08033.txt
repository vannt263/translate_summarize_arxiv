    "the relation between time reversal symmetry and statistical physics is subtle and not all statistical theories are invariant under time reversal , the most famous counterexample being the boltzmann equation of classical statistical mechanics and its quantum generalization .",
    "therefore , extensive work has been done over the recent seven decades to derive non - markovian generalizations of the boltzmann equation that are time - reversal invariant as the underlying quantum mechanical system . among the well established approaches we mention density operator concepts , see e.g. [ ] for an overview , and nonequilibrium green functions [ ] , for a recent text book discussion , see [ ] . despite recent activities in this field we are not aware of a general analysis of the time reversal properties of the resulting generalized quantum kinetic equations . since these equations are usually solved with the help of certain many - body approximations , it is even more important to understand under which conditions time reversal invariance is retained",
