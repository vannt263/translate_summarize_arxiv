    "our goal is to maximise the fitness function where we count the number of the pixels matching those of the target image @xmath0 .",
    "this problem mirrors the classical onemax problem , which has been widely studied in academic literature  @xcite .",
    "we start by introducing a variant of the asymmetric mutation operator studied in the context of minimum spanning trees  @xcite and pseudo - boolean optimization@xcite .",
    "this operator is based on flipping pixels with a given probability in each step and avoids the coupon collectors effect  @xcite by using standard bit mutation applied to onemax .",
    "afterwards , we introduce specific mutation operators for evolutionary image transition , namely strip and box mutations , which pick parts of the image consisting of strips and boxes and set them to the target image .",

    "artificial intelligence as a medium for creating art has a long and well - established tradition .",

    "we consider an evolutionary transition process that transforms a given image @xmath4 of size @xmath8 into a given target image @xmath0 of size @xmath8 .",
    "our goal is to study different ways of carrying out this evolutionary transformation based on random processes from an artistic perspective .",
    "we start our process with a starting image @xmath9 .",
    "our algorithms evolve @xmath1 towards @xmath0 and have at each point in time an image @xmath4 where @xmath10 .",
    "we say that pixel @xmath11 is in state @xmath12 if @xmath13 , and @xmath11 is in state @xmath14 if @xmath15 . for our process",
    "we assume that @xmath16 as pixels with @xmath17 can not change values and therefore do not have to be considered in the evolutionary process . to illustrate the effect of the different methods presented in this paper , we consider two images of famous kyoto temples ( see figure  [ fig : opera ] ) .",
    "the fitness function of an evolutionary algorithm guides its search process and determines how to move between images .",
    "therefore , the fitness function itself has a strong influence on the artistic behaviour of the evolutionary image transition process .",
    "an important property for evolutionary image transition , in this work , is that images close to the target image get a higher fitness score .",
    "we measure the fitness of an image @xmath4 as the number of pixels where @xmath4 and @xmath0 agree .",
    "this fitness function is isomorphic to that of the onemax problem when interpreting the pixels of @xmath1 as @xmath18 s and the pixels of @xmath0 as @xmath19 s .",
    "formally , we define the fitness of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath0 as    @xmath20    we consider simple variants of the classical ( 1 + 1 )  eain the context of image transition .",
    "the algorithm is using mutation only and accepts an offspring if it is at least as good as its parent according to the fitness function .",
    "the approach is given in algorithm  [ alg : ea ] .",
    "using this algorithm has the advantage that parents and offspring do not differ too much in terms of pixel which ensures a smooth process for transitioning the starting image towards the target .",
    "all experimental results in this paper are shown for the process of moving from the starting image to the target image given in figure  [ fig : opera ] where the images are of size @xmath21 pixels .",
    "the algorithms have been implemented in matlab . in order to visualize the process ,",
    "we show the images obtained when the evolutionary process reaches 12.5% , 37.5% , 62.5% and 87.5% of pixels evolved towards the target image .",
    "we consider a simple evolutionary algorithm that has been well studied in the area of runtime analysis , namely variants of the classical ( 1 + 1 )  ea  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , our setting for the image transition process is equivalent to the optimization process for the classical benchmark function onemax .",
    "the standard variant of the ( 1 + 1 )  eaflips each pixel with probability @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total number of pixels in the given image .",
    "using this mutation operator , the algorithm encounters the well - known coupon collector s effect which means that the additive drift towards the target image when having @xmath24 missing target pixels is @xmath25  @xcite .    -6pt",
    "+      * obtain @xmath3 from @xmath4 by flipping each pixel @xmath11 of @xmath4 independently of the others with probability @xmath26 if @xmath27 , and flip @xmath11 with probability @xmath28 if @xmath15 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants .    in order to avoid the coupon collector s effect but obtaining images where all pixel are treated symmetrically , we use the _ asymmetric mutation _ operator introduced in @xcite .",
    "jansen and sudholt  @xcite have shown that the ( 1 + 1 )  ea using _ asymmetric mutation _ optimizes onemax in time @xmath31 which improves upon the usual bound of @xmath32 when using standard bit mutations .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the number of pixels where @xmath4 and @xmath0 agree .",

    "each pixel is starting state @xmath12 is flipped with probability @xmath26 and each pixel in target state @xmath14 is flipped with probability @xmath28 . the mutation operator is shown in algorithm  [ alg : asym ] .",
    "the mutation operator differs from the one given in  @xcite by the two constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 which allow one to determine the expected number of new pixels from the starting image and the target image , respectively .",
    "the choice of @xmath35 and @xmath36 determines the expected number of pixel in the starting state and target state to be flipped . to be precise , the expected number of pixels currently in the starting state @xmath12 to be flipped is @xmath37 and the number of pixels in the target state @xmath14 to be flipped is @xmath38 as long as the current solution @xmath4 contains at least that many pixel of the corresponding type . in @xcite",
    "the case @xmath39 has been investigated which ensures that at each point in time has an additive drift of @xmath40 and therefore avoiding the coupon collector effect at the end of the process .",
    "using different values for @xmath35 and @xmath36 allows us to change the speed of transition as well as the relation of the number of pixels switching from the starting image to the target and vice versa while still ensuring that there is constant progress towards the target . for all our experiments we use @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "-6pt      +      we now introduce specific mutation operators for image transition . the design of our three mutation operators , namely _ strip mutation _ , _ combined strip mutation _ and _ block mutation _ , is strongly oriented towards production of interesting artistic images .",
    "all of these mutation operators transition a region of the current image @xmath4 to an area of the target image @xmath0 , starting at randomly chosen pixel position @xmath11 .",
    "_ strip mutation _ mutates a vertical strip of pixels from @xmath11 for a length of @xmath43 pixels or to the boundary of the image whichever comes first . _",
    "the strip mutation _ imitates well - know technique in generative art called a glitch .",
    "this effect intentionally corrupts data of an image by encoding the jpeg process .",
    "all experiments shows that in each new generation the initial image and the target image overlay through a series of randomly placed strips . in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "we show the experimental results of _ strip mutation_. the effect of _ strip mutation _",
    "creates generative art with highly interesting components .",
    "furthermore , we have conceptualised a _ combined strip mutation _",
    "operator where both horizontal and vertical strips gradually overlay the original image in random locations .",
    "the parameter settings for _ the combined strip mutation _ are @xmath44 pixels in width and @xmath45 pixels in height for the horizontal strip and one pixel in width and @xmath44 pixels in height for the vertical orientation .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows a very interesting transition from the point of view of an image processing which also has artistic value .",
    "our third mutation operator is _",
    "block mutation_. this operator randomly selects a position in the space of the matrix @xmath46 and flips a block of @xmath47 pixels . because the position chosen for mutation can be any point @xmath11 we can observe that mutated blocks can overlap .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the experimental results of _ block mutation_. we have executed a smooth transition so as to interest the viewer .",
    "additionally , we have made the changes in the image clearly visible .    -6pt",
    "_ the asymmetric , strip , combined strip _ and _ box mutation",
    "_ operators have quite distinct behaviours when applied to image transition .",
    "we now study the effect of combining the approaches for evolutionary image transition in order to obtain a more artistic evolutionary process .",
    "we explore the combination of _ the asymmetric mutation _ operator and _ strip , combined strip _ and _ box mutation_. here we run _ the asymmetric mutation _ operator as described in algorithm  [ alg : asym ] .",
    "the process alternates between _ asymmetric mutation _ and one of either _ strip _ , _ combined strip _ or _",
    "box mutation_.    figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the results of the experiments for _ combined asymmetric _ and _ strip mutation_. the transitional images are significantly different to the images produced in _ strip mutation _ or _ box mutation_.",

    "similar elements are shown as a characteristically steadily changing , whereas the elements of the target image continuously appear .",
    "on the last image we can almost completely see the details of the target image .",
    "the blurred elements seem to be created through the bright autumn colour in the target image in this stage of the sequence .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows the results of the experiments for _ combined asymmetric _ and _ combined strip mutation_. the lower sequence of the picture is similar to the top in terms of the behaviour of the patches .",
    "more differences can be seen as the transition progresses , but the picture continues to be partially unrecognisable during the transition .",
    "new elements can be discovered on the affected image which slowly appear and create an element of surprise .",
    "we see less of the dotted image pattern , but now observe combined blurred elements randomly occurring in the upper sequence of the images .",
    "the image provides an interesting comparison to the old linen pictures of the rembrandt epoch . in the advanced stages , the patches are well integrated into the images using _",
