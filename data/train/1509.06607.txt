    "observations of carbon monoxide ( co ) provide a robust window into circumstellar chemistry . due to the large percentage of carbon ( @xmath9 to @xmath10 ) and oxygen ( @xmath11 ) tied up in co in the early stages of young stellar object ( yso ) formation @xcite",
    ", co is a valuable tracer of chemical inheritance from the envelope to the disk in solar - type ysos .",
    "the use of high - resolution spectroscopy to observe co at infrared wavelengths enables high - precision investigations of isotope fractionation in both oxygen and carbon toward ysos in embedded and disk - phase evolutionary stages , and is consequently an important tool for connecting the solar system to currently forming protoplanetary systems .",
    "examples include observational studies toward diffuse clouds and inferring isotopologue - specific photodissociation by co self - shielding as a potentially important mechanism of carbon isotope fractionation in co in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "further , high - resolution near - infrared observations of the co rovibrational band toward protoplanetary disks @xcite and protostellar envelopes have recently revealed signatures in co isotopologue ratios that are consistent with co self - shielding , with precision sufficiently high for comparison to meteoritic data @xcite .",
    "observations of isotope ratios toward ysos and , where possible , their parent clouds , are valuable in assessing theorized similarities between circumstellar envelopes , disks and dense clouds local to their origin .",
    "this is important not only for evaluating predictions of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models that are constrained by solar system abundances , but also for characterizing the range of carbon isotope ratios toward ysos varying with evolutionary stage , and establishing accurate astrochemical constraints on protoplanetary environments .",
    "observational studies can help demonstrate whether there are significant isotopic differences or trends between diffuse clouds , dense molecular clouds , and ysos .",
    "these in turn help construct explanations for apparent chemical anomalies , such as the @xmath0c/@xmath2c solar system - interstellar medium ( ism ) discrepancy and solar system oxygen isotope anomaly .",
    "this paper focuses on the carbon isotopic systems in ysos as traced by high - resolution observations of co isotopologues , with additional mention of significant findings in oxygen isotopes .",

    "values of @xmath0c/@xmath2c for the solar system have been consistently higher than those of @xmath13 to 69 observed toward the local ism , measured using millimeter to sub - millimeter rotational transitions of various carbon - bearing molecules , co , cn , ch@xmath14 , and h@xmath15co @xcite .",
    "the apparent discrepancy in @xmath0c/@xmath2c between the solar system and ism has been attributed to gce leading to enrichment of @xmath2c relative to @xmath0c over the @xmath16 gyr lifetime of the solar system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "an important property of gce models is the assumption that the solar system records the chemical state of the molecular cloud material @xmath16gyr ago .",
    "that is , the assumption that the solar nebula was isotopically representative of its parent cloud at its galactic radius at the time of formation should also hold for present - day solar - type ysos .",
    "the challenge for observational comparisons of solar system isotope ratios in general is the need for high precision in molecular abundance measurements .",
    "while techniques using strong rotational lines in the millimeter / sub - millimeter range often involve model - dependent comparisons between optically thick and thin lines , high - resolution infrared spectrographs have enabled significant breakthroughs in observations of nearby ysos .",
    "infrared absorption spectroscopy of optically thin co lines allows for precise column density measurements along pencil - beam lines - of - sight , enabling the derivation of precise column densities and isotope ratios from the line profiles of as many as four currently observable co isotopologues ( @xmath0c@xmath1o , @xmath2c@xmath1o , @xmath0c@xmath17o , @xmath0c@xmath18o ) .",
    "robust isotope ratios so derived can be compared with statistical significance to sub - millimeter ism values , solar abundances , and meteoritic oxygen .",

    "the study reported here builds on this work .",
    "our targets span a range in @xmath0c@xmath1o ice optical depth , from nearly saturated to undetected , providing an opportunity to investigate a potential observational connection between the co ice and gas reservoirs by comparing the gas - phase [ @xmath0c@xmath1o]/[@xmath2c@xmath1o ] to the co ice column along a single line - of - sight .",
    "since solids tend to concentrate the heavy isotope , relative ice - gas partioning may lead to a paucity of @xmath2c ( or excess of @xmath0c ) in the gas phase , with the opposite signature sequestered in the ice .",

    "atomic carbon liberated by co photodissociation is photoionized largely to c@xmath378 , and c@xmath378 reacts rapidly to exchange carbon with co by the reaction @xmath2c@xmath378 + @xmath379o @xmath380 @xmath0c@xmath378 + @xmath2co + 35 k @xcite , driving @xmath2c back into co and diminishing the signature of selective photodissociation .",
    "however , very high [ @xmath0c@xmath1o]/[@xmath2c@xmath1o ] ratios derived for diffuse clouds have nevertheless been attributed to co self - shielding .",
    "values of @xmath336 , @xmath381 @xcite , and @xmath382 @xcite have been observed toward diffuse ophiuchus clouds that are thought to be subjected to high - uv fields , and where co photodissociation is thought to dominate over the carbon exchange reaction that would otherwise erase a photochemical signature .",
    "while the upper range in [ @xmath0c@xmath1o]/[@xmath2c@xmath1o ] in our sample is consistent with the ophiuchus data ( figure [ gc_co_plot ] ) , we do not find the expected mass - independent signatures in oxygen isotopes consistent with co self - shielding .",
    "further , as compared to diffuse clouds , we would not expect the molecular gas deep inside embedded yso envelopes to be subjected to such high uv fields given their relatively high values of visual extinction ( @xmath383 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "heterogenous [ @xmath0c@xmath1o]/[@xmath2c@xmath1o ] gas - phase abundance ratios , with several unusually high values , have been found using infrared absorption spectroscopy at very high resolution toward a sample of ysos in nearby star - forming clouds . a possible partial explanation for this trend may be co isotopologue partitioning between the ice and gas reservoirs .",
    "the degree of partitioning and the preservation of the relation in warm regions where the co ice has sublimated would require the action of a process that can remove co from the ice phase without returning it to the gas .",
    "additional high - quality data could help substantiate these findings .",
    "signatures consistent with isotopologue - selective photodissociation by co self - shielding in oxygen were observed in the oxygen isotopes toward the disks , hl tau and vv cra .",
    "however , our results do not support co self - shielding as a dominant mechanism for explaining the trends in the gas - phase [ @xmath0c@xmath1o]/[@xmath2c@xmath1o ] heterogeneity .",
    "we conclude that chemical evolution models for young stellar environments should consider the interaction between co ice and gas reservoirs as a potential fractionation mechanism affecting the carbon isotope budget and influencing carbon isotopic heterogeneity in the gas .",
    "interactions between these reservoirs could also contribute to isotopic heterogeneity between solar - type ysos and their parent clouds .",
    "finally , isotopologue - selective photodissociation by co self - shielding should be considered an important mechanism affecting oxygen isotopes in protoplanetary disks , potentially persisting in the later stages of planet formation .",
