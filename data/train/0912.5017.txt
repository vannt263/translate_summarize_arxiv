    "in a series of recent publications we studied the extraction of the ground - state parameters from svz sum rules  @xcite ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we made use of a quantum - mechanical potential model since this is essentially the only case where the standard procedures adopted in the method of sum rules may be tested : the estimates for the ground - state parameters obtained by these procedures may be compared with the actual values of the ground - state parameters calculated from the schrdinger equation , thus providing an unambiguous check of the reliability of the method .",
    "the main results of our papers may be summarized as follows : ( i ) the standard approximation of a constant effective continuum threshold does not allow one to probe the accuracy of the extracted hadron parameter @xcite .",
    "( ii ) allowing for a borel - parameter - dependent effective continuum threshold ( we denote the borel parameter @xmath0 in qcd and @xmath1 in the potential model ) and fixing this quantity by using the information on the ground - state mass leads to a considerable improvement of the accuracy of the method @xcite .",
    "the goal of this letter is to demonstrate that the results obtained at each step of the extraction procedure both in qcd and in potential models follow the same pattern .",
    "this similarity gives a strong argument that all our findings concerning the extraction of bound - state parameters from correlators obtained in potential model apply also to qcd .",
    "in particular , it points out a way of improving the results for bound - state parameters obtained from various correlators in qcd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect : qcd ] we recall the qcd results from ref .",
    "@xcite for the vacuum correlator of two pseudoscalar currents  the basic object for the extraction of @xmath2 within the framework of qcd sum rules .",
    "section [ sect : qm ] provides the analogous results for a quantum - mechanical model for the case of a potential containing confining and coulomb interactions .",
    "section [ sect : sr ] compares the procedures of extracting the decay constant .",
    "section [ sect : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "let us consider the correlator @xmath3 of two pseudoscalar currents @xmath4 .",
    "the borel - transformed operator product expansion ( ope ) series for this correlator has the form @xmath5 where the perturbative spectral density reads @xmath6 @xmath7 being the renormalization scale .",
    "we make use of the results for @xmath8 reported in @xcite and do not reproduce the explicit expression for this quantity here . following the argument of @xcite we work in terms of the running masses in the @xmath9 scheme .",
    "therefore , in all expressions in this section the quark masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the @xmath9 running quantities at the scale  @xmath7 .",
    "recall that the full borel - transformed correlator ( [ ope_qcd ] ) does not depend on the renormalization scale @xmath7 ; however , both the perturbative expansion truncated to a fixed order in @xmath12 and the truncated power corrections depend on @xmath7 .",
    "we provide numerical estimates for @xmath13 ; for this choice of the scale the known terms of the perturbative expansion exhibit a good hierarchy .",
    "we set @xmath14 gev and for other qcd parameters make use of the central values reported in table i of @xcite . and on the specific choice of the renormalization scale @xmath7 .",
    "however , a discussion of this dependence is far beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a detailed analysis of @xmath2 in qcd is deferred to a separate publication . ]",
    "the power corrections have been also considered in @xcite : @xmath15 + \\frac{1}{12}\\langle{\\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi } ff}\\rangle \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath16 describes the contribution of the four - quark condensate .",
    "notice that radiative corrections to the condensates increase rather fast with @xmath0 .",
    "the correlator ( [ pi_qcd ] ) may be calculated in terms of hadron intermediate states : @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the decay constant of the @xmath18-meson , defined by @xmath19 for large values of @xmath0 the contributions of the excited states decrease faster than the ground - state contribution and @xmath20 is dominated by the ground state .",
    "unfortunately , the truncated ope does not allow to evaluate the correlator  at sufficiently large @xmath0 , so the excited states give a sizeable contribution to @xmath20 for the considered values of @xmath0 .    according to the duality assumption ,",
    "the contribution of the excited states is described by the perturbative contribution above some effective continuum threshold @xmath21 .",
    "then one obtains the following relation : @xmath22 with @xmath23 in the region near the physical continuum threshold at @xmath24 , the perturbative spectral density and the hadron spectral density are very different .",
    "consequently , the effective continuum threshold as defined in ( [ sr_qcd ] ) turns out to be necessarily a function of the borel parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the necessity of the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath21 may be understood by comparing the left - hand side ( l.h.s . ) and right - hand side ( r.h.s . ) of ( [ sr_qcd ] ) : the only way to obtain a single exponential on the l.h.s .  for a given spectral density of the integral representation on the r.h.s .",
    "is to have a @xmath0-dependent @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath21 may be also demonstrated explicitly : for any value of the ground - state parameters on the l.h.s .  of ( [ sr_qcd ] )",
    "one can obtain numerically @xmath21 and see that it does depend on @xmath0 .",
    "one should be aware of the fact that the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath21 can not and does not contradict to any principles of field theory : the dual correlator is a _ hand - made _ object ; such an object does not emerge in field theory .",
    "therefore , the properties of the dual correlator ( e.g. , its analytic properties ) are very different from the properties of the field - theoretic correlators .",
    "clearly , the standard assumption of a @xmath0-independent @xmath21 is a possible assumption .",
    "we shall demonstrate , however , that relaxing this assumption leads to a visible improvement of the obtained results .",
    "we define the dual decay constant and the dual invariant mass by the relations @xmath25 notice that the deviation of the dual mass from the actual mass of the ground state gives an indication of the excited - state contributions picked up by the dual correlator .",
    "in parallel to qcd , let us consider a quantum - mechanical model with a potential containing a confining part , for which we take the ho form , and an attractive coulomb interaction : @xmath26 a quantum - mechanical analogue of the borelized two - point function has the form @xcite @xmath27 we construct the analogue of the ope series for this correlator by retaining , similar to the qcd case , the perturbative contributions up to @xmath28 ( three loops of the non - relativistic field theory ) and two power corrections , including @xmath29 corrections to them .",
    "the resulting expression reads ( the correlator for a pure coulomb potential can be found in  @xcite ) : the system behaves like a free system , since the contribution of the confining potential as well as  that of the radiative corrections vanish for small @xmath1 . according to @xcite this is a signature of asymptotic freedom .",
    "so , a non - relativistic potential model ( [ h ] ) even with a constant @xmath30 behaves like an asymptotically free theory . ]",

    ", we adopt the following parameter values : a reduced quark mass of @xmath36  gev ,  which corresponds to a constituent quark mass of 0.350  gev relevant for nonrelativistic computations ; @xmath37  gev , which leads to a realistic radius of the @xmath38 system , and @xmath39 .",
    "the energy and wave function of the ground state are found by solving numerically the schrdinger equation with the help of the mathematica code provided in @xcite : the ground - state energy is @xmath40  gev [ for comparison , a pure ho model yields @xmath41  gev ] ; the ground - state wave function at the origin has the value @xmath42",
    "gev@xmath43 [ @xmath44 gev@xmath43 ] .",
    "obviously , the effect of the coulomb interaction is not small .",
    "whether a @xmath0-independent or some @xmath0-dependent effective continuum threshold is considered , the crucial problem  is  the choice of the criterion for fixing this quantity .",
    "we shall proceed as follows :      first , we must fix the working @xmath0 window where , on the one hand , the ope gives an accurate description of the exact correlator ( i.e. , the higher - order radiative and power corrections are small ) and , on the other hand , the ground  state gives a sizeable contribution to the correlator . in qcd , we set the window as follows : @xmath46 in the region @xmath47 gev@xmath48 the @xmath12 and @xmath49 terms to @xmath20 contribute less than 10% and 3% of the leading term , respectively .",
    "power corrections give about 20% of the leading term .",
    "we point out that the radiative corrections to the condensates increase rather fast with @xmath0 , so it is preferable to stay at relatively low values of @xmath0",
    ". therefore our window is located at the lower values of @xmath0 compared to the window adopted in @xcite ; in the region ( [ our_window ] ) the accuracy of the truncated ope is higher .",
    "it is known that the experimental value of the @xmath18 meson decay constant is @xmath50 mev . adopting this value",
    ", we may calculate the relative contribution of the ground state to the correlator .",
    "in our window it does not exceed 50% .",
    "in the potential model , we choose the window as @xmath51 for these values of @xmath1 the omitted unknown higher - order power corrections are negligible , so the correlator is known with good accuracy .",
    "the relative contribution of the ground state to the correlator amounts to 10% at @xmath52 and to 50% at @xmath53 .",
    "we shall see that for a relative ground - state contribution of this size our procedure allows one to extract the decay constant with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "widely used is the so - called stability criterion : one looks for that constant value of @xmath21 for which the extracted  decay constant is most stable in the window .",
    "this borel stability is an implementation of a self - evident statement that the physical observable can not depend on @xmath0 , an auxiliary parameter of the method .",
    "the problem is , however , that the independence of a hadron decay constant of @xmath0 , being a necessary condition , is not sufficient to guarantee the extraction of the right value .",
    "we have given several examples for potential models @xcite which nicely demonstrate that assuming  a @xmath0-independent effective continuum threshold and fixing its value by requiring maximal stability in the borel window may lead to the extraction of a very inaccurate value .",
    "in this paper , we consider a different algorithm for the extraction of @xmath54 which makes use of the knowledge of the ground - state mass @xcite . in parallel",
    "to qcd we present also the results for a quantum - mechanical model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "this is done in order to demonstrate the way our algorithm works in the case where the exact value of the decay constant is known .",
    "a comparison makes  clear that , with respect to the extraction procedure , there are no essential differences between qcd and quantum mechanics .",
    "the algorithm developed in our previous works and established to work well for different correlators in the potential model is very simple : we consider a set of @xmath0-dependent anstze for the effective continuum threshold ( for the case of the potential model one just replaces @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 obviously , the standard @xmath0-independent effective continuum threshold is also taken account by ( [ zeff ] ) . now",
    ", we fix the parameters on the r.h.s .  of ( [ zeff ] )",
    "as follows : we calculate the dual mass squared according to ( [ mdual ] ) for the @xmath0-dependent @xmath21 of eq .",
    "( [ zeff ] ) .",
    "we then evaluate @xmath58 at several values of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , where @xmath61 can be taken arbitrarily large ) chosen uniformly in the window .",
    "finally , we minimize the squared difference between @xmath62 and the known value @xmath63 : @xmath64 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this gives us the parameters of the effective continuum thresholds .",
    "as soon as the latter are fixed , it is straightforward to obtain the decay constant .",
    "figure  [ plot:1 ] shows the results for qcd and for our potential model ; in the latter the actual value of the decay constant has been found from the schrdinger equation , so that we may control each step of the extraction procedure .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     first , let us notice that the borel - parameter - dependent effective thresholds corresponding to @xmath65 and @xmath66 lead to a visible improvement of the stability of the dual mass [ figs .",
    "[ plot:1](c ) and ( d ) ] compared to the constant threshold .",
    "this means that the dual correlator for @xmath67 is less contaminated by the excited states ; according to the philosophy of qcd sum rules the better stability of @xmath68 with @xmath67 is an important achievement for the trustability of the results .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] , in the potential model the true value of the decay constant lies in the band provided by the linear ( @xmath65 ) and the quadratic ( @xmath66 ) fits . we have checked that this result holds in a broad range of the parameters of the potential model .",
    "the similarities of each step of the extraction procedure in qcd and in the potential model  are evident .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to expect that also in qcd the decay constant lies in the range provided by the linear and the quadratic fits .",
    "anyway , the difference of the results obtained for @xmath65 and @xmath66 constitutes a realistic estimate of the intrinsic uncertainty of the extracted decay constant .",
    "if one considers only the standard constant ansatz ( @xmath69 ) for the effective continuum threshold , the accuracy of the extracted decay constant can not be probed .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the extraction of the decay constant from the two - point function in qcd and in a potential model .",
    "our results may be summarized as follows :    * the comparison presented in this work makes obvious that , with respect to the extraction of the ground - state parameters , there are no essential differences between qcd and quantum mechanics : as soon as the parameters of the lagrangian are fixed , and the truncated ope is calculated with a reasonable accuracy ( taking into account also the relevant choice of the renormalization scale in qcd ) , the extraction procedures are very similar .",
    "+ at first glance , this similarity might look surprising since we know that the structure of bound states in potential models and in qcd are rather different .",
    "however , the method of dispersive sum rules does not make use of ( and does not provide ) information about the details of the ground - state structure .",
    "what really matters for extracting the ground - state parameters in this method is the structure of the ope for a given correlator . since the structure of the ope in qcd and of its analogue in potential models is rather similar , it should not be surprising at all that the extraction procedures in potential models and in qcd are similar , too .",
    "+ in view of the above similarity , our previous results for the extraction of the ground - state parameters ( including also the form factors @xcite ) obtained in potential models have direct implications for the corresponding analyses  in qcd and should be taken quite seriously . *",
    "allowing for @xmath0-dependent anstze for the effective continuum threshold leads to two essential improvements : + \\(a ) the stability of both the dual mass and the dual decay constant in the window is considerably improved if one proceeds from the standard @xmath0-independent to the @xmath0-dependent ansatz for the effective continuum threshold .",
    "+ \\(b ) in the potential model , where the exact decay constant has been calculated from the schrdinger equation , allowing for a @xmath0-dependent effective continuum threshold and fixing its parameters according to ( [ chisq ] )  i.e. , by minimizing the deviation of the dual mass from the known ground - state mass in the window  leads to the extraction of a more accurate value .",
    "as follows from our analysis , a realistic band of values of the decay constant is provided by the numerical results obtained with the linear and quadratic anstze for the effective continuum threshold . the intrinsic uncertainty ( i.e.",
    ", the one related to the extraction procedure ) of the decay constant found in this way is expected to be at the level of a few percent .",
    "+ although not rigorous in the mathematical sense , this estimate for the systematic uncertainty may be considered as a realistic educated guess supported by findings in models where the true value of the decay constant is known . moreover , we have  doubts that a more rigorous estimate of the intrinsic error of the method of sum rules may be obtained in principle",
