    "the cheshire cat experiment @xcite demonstrates a unique property of pre- and post - selected systems : we can find the spin of a particle ( or polarization of a photon ) even in places where the particle seems to be absent .",
    "the same can be generalized to every property of the quantum particles .",
    "this observation was possible , _ in a non - counterfactual way _",
    ", by performing weak measurements @xcite of the particle s spin and position , and finding their so called `` weak values '' .",
    "weak values can be seen as a generalization of expectation values to cases where the measured system has two different boundary conditions - at some initial and some final times . within the two - state vector formalism ( tsvf ) of quantum mechanics , these boundary conditions , known as pre- and post - selection ,",
    "can be understood to evolve forward and backward in time ( respectively ) to define a richer notion of quantum reality at the intermediate times @xcite .",
    "the weak values are defined at any moment @xmath0 by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the pre-/post - selected states respectively , and @xmath4 is the measured operator .",
    "the formulation of the original cheshire cat thought experiment is as follows : let a particle have two degrees of freedom : spatial @xmath5,@xmath6 and spinorial @xmath7,@xmath8 along the @xmath9 direction .",
    "the particle is pre - selected at the initial time in the entangled state @xmath10    later on , the particle is post - selected ( using a projective measurement ) in the product state @xmath11    using weak measurements at intermediate times , the particle is understood to be on the _ right _ , since @xmath12 and it has an `` up '' spin along the @xmath9 direction , because @xmath13 however , its spin is on the _ left _ @xmath14",
    "this can be understood as the failure of the product rule for weak values between pre- and post - selected states : the weak value of the product does not equal the product of weak values .    to better monitor this process",
    "we shall now slightly modify it to include the quantum zeno effect @xcite .    in the rest of of the paper we will propose a dynamic analysis of this phenomenon , in a manner which will allow us to deduce some surprising features of pre- and post - selected ensembles .",
    "more generally , we will be able to understand quantum nonlocality , in some cases , as a local phenomenon of current without mass .",
    "in what follows we shall demonstrate the gradual ( local ) process resulting in the fading cat , and the `` massless current '' . throughout the calculation",
    "@xmath15 consider an electron free to move inside a @xmath16 cavity .",
    "the left wall , located at @xmath17 , is a perfect reflector and the right wall at @xmath18 has the following interaction with the electron s spin : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the heaviside function , i.e. the electron is facing a high step potential only if it has spin up along the @xmath9-direction . between the walls , at @xmath21 , a high , narrow potential barrier is placed , with a very small transmission coefficient @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this potential exerts the quantum zeno effect which is essential to our analysis .",
    "the electron is prepared in a well localized state on the left side of the cavity with spin up along the @xmath24 direction @xmath25 to the right .",
    "when hitting the narrow potential its state will change according to : @xmath26    the @xmath27 component of the electron s spin interacts strongly with the left wall . at times",
    "@xmath28 , where @xmath29 is some integer , the electron has an approximate probability of @xmath22 to leave the left side of the cavity and tunnel to the right .",
    "these small amplitudes are coherently added at the right side of the cavity , hence after @xmath29 such cycles , the electron s state will be : @xmath30 therefore , when @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 , we have a non - negligible probability to find the electron on the right side of the cavity .    however , if the electron has spin @xmath33 , fractions of @xmath22 `` leak '' after times @xmath34 . in this case , the amplitudes are not - coherently added , hence after @xmath35 cycles , there is still a high probability to find the electron on the right side : @xmath36    for this reason , if after time @xmath37 we find the electron in the left side of the cavity , we conclude that most - likely it has spin @xmath33 ( note that as opposed to the original cheshire cat experiment , post - selection is now performed only on the spatial degree of freedom , which nevertheless reveals the spin ) .",
    "in other words , if after time @xmath38 we measure its spin along the @xmath24-axis , there is approximately @xmath39 chance we would find @xmath40 , that is , orthogonal to its initial state ( eq . [ initial ] ) .",
    "it seems paradoxical that a particle changes its initial state to an orthogonal state , due to a force it rarely `` feels '' .",
    "how could this happen ? during the time interval @xmath41",
    "there was only a negligible probability of finding the electron on the right side of the cavity , but after time @xmath38 we find the effect of the potential in the right side with probability approaching @xmath42 .",
    "this apparent paradox can be resolved using the concept of the `` quantum cheshire cat '' . indeed , if the spin of the electron could leave its mass behind ( at the left side of the cavity ) and travel to the right",
    ", we could understand this weird interaction in a local sense .",
    "hence , the apparently nonlocal interaction is made local by the weak current of the spin . by using weak measurements at the intermediate times",
    "we will now test this claim .",
    "the initial ( pre - selected ) wavefunction in eq .",
    "[ initial ] evolves to : @xmath43.\\ ] ] in addition , finding the electron on the left side of the cavity after time @xmath37 is amount to a post - selection of the state : @xmath44 that is , although a position measurement was performed , the spin of the electron is also known .",
    "the backward evolution of this state is : @xmath45    for all intermediate times it can be easily found according to eqs .",
    "[ wv],[evo1],[evo2 ] , that : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are projections on the left and right sides of the cavity , respectively .",
    "consequently , @xmath49 , which ought to be like that , because the post - selected state is an eigenstate of @xmath50 with eigenvalue @xmath51 .",
    "more importantly , the value of @xmath52 on the right side of the cavity is given by the weak value ( see eq .",
    "[ wv ] ) @xmath53 that is , @xmath52 gradually increases over time on the right side of the cavity , despite the fact that the electron rarely reaches there . to find the total spin in the right side of the cavity we will sum over all the contributions until time @xmath54 : @xmath55    to understand how @xmath52 of the initial state changes over time we shall use the heisenberg equation : @xmath56=-v_0\\theta(x)\\sigma_y.\\ ] ] the value of @xmath57 between the pre- and post - selection in the right side of the cavity is given by the following weak value @xmath58 where we used eqs .",
    "[ evo1],[evo2 ] .",
    "hence , for @xmath59 there is an imaginary current of @xmath52 accounting for the local change of the spin from @xmath60 at the beginning to @xmath61 at the end ( to better understand the appearance of imaginary weak value here , see @xcite ) .",
    "for @xmath62 there is a real , tunneling current of the @xmath63 , as well as a real current of the transmitted @xmath64 .",
    "we assume now that besides the electron , the right wall in sec .",
    "ii also has an inner degree of freedom ( `` spin '' )",
    ". the interaction hamiltonian would be now : @xmath65 where @xmath66 refers to the electron and @xmath67 refers to the right wall , i.e. the electron interacts with wall only when there spins along the z - direction are parallel .",
    "assume the initial state of the system is : @xmath68    finding the electron after time @xmath38 in the left side of the cavity , singles out the states @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the two spins .",
    "therefore , during the time evolution of the system , the spins of the electron and the wall have become maximally entangled , that is , their state have changed to @xmath71    in the previous section we saw a `` leakage '' of a one - particle - state , but now we observe a gradual leakage of an entangled state . as done before , we can monitor the process using weak measurements and verify the interaction at the meeting point after each period time .",
    "thus , the seemingly nonlocal effect turns out to have a local description based on a massless current of entangled spins .",
    "this work presents , for the first time , a dynamical analysis of weak values which sheds light on the cheshire cat paradox and on the quantum zeno effect .",
    "the spin of a particle , was shown to gradually flow from its mass while interacting with a potential barrier .",
    "it was then demonstrated how to entangle two distant systems by utilizing a current of entangled states .",
    "all the above processes , which at first seem nonlocal , can be understood locally using currents of spin weak values without mass .",
    "similarly to the demonstration of interaction - free measurement with zeno effect @xcite , the above predictions can be tested in a laboratory experiment with photons instead of electrons and a polarizing beam - splitter instead of the right wall .",
