    "the interaction between cup products and intersection forms is a basic method to essentially analyse @xmath0-manifolds in the history ( e.g. , the classification theorem of simply connected manifolds ) . typically , concerning the poincar duality with trivial coefficients , non - degeneracy of the intersection form was comprehensive in the view of the cup product . here",
    ", it is worth noting that the interactions are reflected on algebraic futures of the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , once the ( co)homology groups are investigated with local coefficients @xmath3 , such an interaction has many unknown aspects with ambiguity and differences ; actually , graded commutativity and the krull dimension of @xmath3 appear as obstructions : for example , we see such a difference even from infinite cyclic cover @xmath4 of closed manifolds ; while the blanchfield duality @xcite on the homology of @xmath4 is defined from some bockstein operator to realize hermitian intersection forms over @xmath5 $ ] , the milnor duality @xcite is with regard to the cup products of @xmath4 over fields and requires some assumptions ; moreover , there has been no description to explicitly connect the two duality ( cf . theorem [ clal22 ] ) . furthermore , the higher duality , as in the casson - gordon invariants @xcite and the higher blanchfield duality @xcite on 3-manifolds , is often approached from intersection forms of coverings ; this homological approach is useful to see duality , but is not compatible with computing the duality , and with other cohomology theory as in characteristics",
    "further , the higher such dualities are up , the more difficulty to choose an appreciate coefficient ring we readily face , as in @xcite .    in this paper , we interpret three classical 3-manifold invariants from twisted pairings , and provide a method of diagrammatically computing them .",
    "the twisted product is constructed from a homomorphism @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a 3-manifold , as follows : set up a relative homology @xmath8-class @xmath9 , a right @xmath10-module @xmath11 and a @xmath10-invariant bilinear function @xmath12 for some ring @xmath3 .",
    "then , we can define the twisted pairings as a bilinear form @xmath13 here we regard @xmath11 as the local coefficient module of @xmath7 via @xmath14 , and the first map @xmath15 is the cup product , and the second ( resp .",
    "third ) is defined by the pairing with @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) .",
    "though this pairing @xmath18 seems speculative and uncomputable from definitions , the author @xcite has developed a diagrammatic computation of the @xmath18 in the link case @xmath19 ( see also  [ s3s3w ] ) . from now on",
    ", we will explain the three 3-manifold invariants in details , where an appreciate choices of @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a key of the interpretation .",
    "0.419937pc ( i ) the first one is a reduction as for the classical blanchfield parings of knots . to be more precise ( theorem [ clal22 ] ) , if @xmath10 is the infinite cyclic group @xmath1 and @xmath7 is the knot complement , the bilinear form associated with appropriate choices of @xmath17 and @xmath11 is equal to the @xmath22-multiple of the classical pairing ; consequently , the theorem enables us to compute the blanchfield pairing using no seifert surface ( cf .",
    "the formulas @xcite from seifert surfaces ) ; as a result , we succeed in first determining the pairing of the torus knot ; see proposition [ exact ] .",
    "furthermore , as a corollary ,  the cocycle knot - invariants @xcite from alexander quandles \" turn to be topologically characterized as the blanchfield pairing ( see theorem [ cla21l31 ] for the details ) ;    0.419937pc ( ii ) furthermore , we also address the twisted pairings of infinite cyclic covers @xmath4 , where the local coefficients arise from linear representations over a field . as in milnor @xcite , the study is an approach to geometrically understand the bockstein operator mentioned above and the ( twisted ) signature of knots . however , as a modification of @xcite , we show ( theorem [ dded ] ) that the cup product is reduced to the bilinear form on the base space @xmath7 ; this theorem has several corollaries : first , since this description coincides with a 2-form on some twisted alexander modules @xcite , we provide the 2-form a topological meaning and show a twisted version of milnor duality @xcite ( see theorem [ mainthm4 ] ) . furthermore , the setting as in @xcite gives an interpretation from goldman s symplectic structure on a flat moduli space of @xmath7 ( see appendix ) .",
    "moreover , since the theorem gives a diagrammatic computation of the twisted pairings in link cases , we give examples of some computations (  [ s3s3w ] ) .",
    "0.419937pc ( iii ) the third one is concerning the casson - gordon local signature @xcite , @xmath23 ; the signature depends on @xmath24 , and is known to be a useful method to estimate the slice 4-genus of knots , as a metabelian viewpoint ; see @xcite . however , to compute the signature from definitions , we readily encounter difficulties to discuss the intersection form of an appreciate 4-manifold and the twist by @xmath25 ; the known computations @xcite are only those with @xmath26 of some knots .",
    "following the idea in @xcite , this paper succeeds in giving a diagrammatic algorithm to practically compute the difference @xmath27 ; see  [ aap1 ] for the detail . since the point is a reduction @xcite of the intersection form to some cup products of 3-manifolds , we need describe no 4-manifold in the algorithm .",
    "however , in this paper , we do not find new examples to detect slice 4-genus ; it is a problem for the further .    0.419937pc",
    "the three applications justify some concrete importance of the twisted pairings as a setting ; in summary , it is sensible to hope that the bilinear form can recover other knot invariants and more computations with appreciate choices of @xmath28 and @xmath17 .",
