    "strong numerical evidence has been obtained that the quantum evolution is very stable , in sharp contrast to the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and rapid loss of memory which is the very essence of classical chaos . in computer simulations the latter effect leads to practical irreversibility of classically chaotic dynamics . indeed , even though the exact equations of motion are reversible , any , however small , imprecision such as computer round - off errors , is magnified by the exponential instability of trajectories to the extent that any memory of the initial conditions is effaced and reversibility is destroyed .",
    "in contrast , almost exact reversion is observed in numerical simulations of the quantum motion of classically chaotic systems , even in the regime in which statistical phenomena such as deterministic diffusion take place @xcite .",
    "it is intuitive that the physical reasons of this striking difference between quantum and classical motion are rooted in the quantization of the phase space in quantum mechanics .",
    "if we consider classical chaotic evolution ( governed by the liouville equation ) of some phase space distribution , smaller and smaller scales are explored exponentially fast with time .",
    "these fine details of the density distribution are lost due to finite accuracy ( inevitable coarse - graining ) in numerical simulations , and therefore the reversal of time evolution can not be carried out . on the other hand , in quantum mechanics",
    "one expects that the structure of a quantal phase - space distribution , e.g. of the wigner function , has resolution limited by the size of the planck s cell .",
    "while the mean number of fourier components of the classical phase - space distribution grows exponentially in time for chaotic motion , the number of the components of the wigner function at any given time is related to the degree of excitation of the system ( see for example eq .",
    "( [ paver_m ] ) below ) and therefore unrestricted exponential growth of this number is not physical @xcite .",
    "this fact implies substantially simpler phase space structure in the case of quantum motion as compared with that of classical chaotic dynamics .",
    "we demonstrate below that the mean number of fourier harmonics is a simple relevant measure of structural complexity which in turn is related to fundamental properties such as decoherence and entanglement .    in spite of the above arguments , a rigorous link between the intuitively expected different degree of reversibility of quantum and classical motion and the structure developed by the phase - space distributions during dynamical evolution has never been established .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to clarify this problem .",
    "following the approach developed in @xcite we consider first the forward evolution @xmath7 of an initial ( generally mixed ) state @xmath8 up to some time @xmath9 .",
    "a perturbation @xmath10 is then applied at this time , with the perturbation strength @xmath4 . for our purposes",

    ". this relation will play the key role in our further analysis .    as we have already mentioned above",
    ", we characterize the complexity of a quantum state by the structure of its wigner function .",
    "the basic idea here is that a quantum state is complex if this function has a rich phase space structure , which can be naturally measured by the number @xmath0 of its fourier harmonics .",
    "we will show that the fidelity @xmath20 is a decreasing function of the complexity @xmath23 of the state @xmath24 .",
    "we will prove further that , after the ehrenfest time scale , namely after a time logarithmically short in the effective planck constant of the system , the number @xmath0 of harmonics increases notfaster than linearly with time .",
    "on the other hand , in classical chaotic dynamics the number of harmonics @xmath25 of the classical phase - space distribution function grows exponentially in time .",
    "we will then ascertain that the initial state is well recovered as long as the perturbation strength @xmath4 is much smaller than a critical perturbation strength @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 drops exponentially with @xmath3 in the classical case and not faster than linearly for quantum evolution .",
