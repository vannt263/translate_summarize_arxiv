    "the task of deriving the mean ages and the mean metal content of stellar populations from their integrated light is complicated by the fact that the effects of variations in the ages and the metal content look very similar in many of the observable parameters .",
    "older stellar populations have redder broad band visual colors than younger stellar populations , while a higher metal content also leads to redder colors .",
    "the strength of many of the metal absorption lines in the visual wavelength region react the same way ; e.g. , the strengths of the magnesium and iron lines increase with both age and metallicity .",
    "thus , it is possible for two galaxies with different ages and metal content to have the same colors and strengths of the metal lines .",
    "this problem of the age - metal `` degeneracy '' in the observed parameters is discussed in detail by worthey ( 1994 ) .",

    "one of the most powerful ways of studying the stellar populations of elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies from their integrated light is to use the strengths of the absorption lines .",
    "the lick / ids system ( faber et al .  1985 ; named after the lick image dissector scanner ) of absorption line indices has been used extensively for this purpose ; e.g. , burstein et al .",

    "models have been developed that predict the line indices , the broad band colors and the mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios for single stellar populations of different ages and metallicities ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; weiss , peletier & matteucci 1995 ; buzzoni 1995 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "1996 ; bressan , chiosi & tantalo 1996 ; bruzual & charlot 1996 ) .",
    "the models by vazdekis et al .  also give predictions for different choices of the initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars .",
    "all the models except the models by weiss et al .  assume solar abundance ratios for the stars , specifically that the magnesium to iron ratio [ mg / fe ] is solar .",
    "the models can be used to interpret the observed line indices and m / l ratios in terms of the mean ages and metallicities of the stellar populations .",
    "worthey ( 1994 ) suggested to use the line index of one or more metal lines together with the line index of the balmer line h@xmath5 to break the degeneracy between age and metallicity .",
    "the h@xmath5 line is more sensitive to the mean age of the stellar population than to its metal content .",
    "the m / l ratios of the galaxies represent another possibility for breaking the degeneracy ( cf .",

    ", we will refer to the h@xmath5 index and the m / l ratio as the age sensitive parameters , while we will use the term metallicity sensitive parameters about the line indices for magnesium , mg@xmath6 and @xmath1 , and the line index for iron , @xmath2 ( @xmath2 is the average of fe5270 and fe5335 ) . however , all the parameters depend on both the age and the metallicity .    using the models ,",
    "the line indices may be transformed into mean ages and metallicities by interpolation between the model values .",
    "worthey , trager & faber ( 1995 ) used this technique and derived ages and metallicities for a sample of e galaxies with data from gonzlez ( 1993 ) and from the lick / ids data , now published by trager et al .  ( 1998 ) .",

    "worthey et al .  as well as faber et al .",

    "the abundance ratios [ mg / fe ] of e and s0 galaxies show substantial variations and many galaxies have [ mg / fe ] above solar ( cf .",
    "peletier 1989 ; worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 ; j97 ) .",
    "worthey et al .  (",

    "this is in agreement with recent results for the large sample of 250 cluster e and s0 galaxies studied by j97 .",
    "the determination of the ages is complicated by the variations in [ mg / fe ] .",
    "if these variations are not taken into account , different ages ( and metallicities ) result from different choices of the metallicity sensitive line index . the results from worthey et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and faber et al .",
    "( 1995 ) show this effect for the indices mg@xmath6 , @xmath2 and c4668 ( c4668 is called fe4668 by worthey ( 1994 ) , and c@xmath74668 by worthey and collaborators in publications after 1995 ) .",
    "these authors use either c4668 or the geometrical mean of mg@xmath6 and @xmath2 , which they name [ mgfe ] , as the metallicity sensitive index .",
    "kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) in their study of a sample of e and s0 galaxies in the fornax cluster also used [ mgfe ] as the metallicity sensitive parameter and the h@xmath5 index as the age sensitive parameter .",
    "the use of the geometrical mean of mg@xmath6 and @xmath2 , [ mgfe ] , does not solve the problem posed by the variations in the abundance ratios , but rather represents a compromise given that most the models are made for solar abundance ratios . in this paper",
    "we suggest an improved method for taking into account the variations in [ mg / fe ] and deriving self - consistent estimates of ages and abundances , even when using single stellar population models derived for solar abundance ratios .",
    "our method solves the problem that different ages and metallicities result from different choices of the metallicity sensitive line index .",
    "the global parameters of e and s0 galaxies have been found to follow a number of tight scaling relations .",
    "the relation know as the fundamental plane ( fp ) relates the effective radius , @xmath8 , the mean surface brightness within this radius , @xmath9 and the ( central ) velocity dispersion @xmath4 , in a relation , which is linear in logarithmic space ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .  1987 ; jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1996 , hereafter jfk96 ) . the fp can be interpreted as a relation between the m / l ratios and the masses of the galaxies ( faber et al .",
    "1987 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 ) .",
    "this interpretation assumes that the e and s0 galaxies have similar luminosity profiles and similar dynamical structure , i.e.  are homologous , such that the masses can be derived from @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "see , e.g. , hjorth & madsen ( 1995 ) and ciotti , lanzoni & renzini ( 1996 ) for discussions of the possible non - homology of e and s0 galaxies .",
    "the line indices @xmath1 and h@xmath5 are strongly correlated with the velocity dispersions of the galaxies ( e.g. , burstein et al .  1988 ; fisher , franx & illingworth 1995 ; j97 ; trager et al .",
    "1998 ) , while the @xmath2 index shows a rather weak correlation with the velocity dispersion ( j97 ; trager et al .  1998 ) .    the low scatter of the fp and of the relations between the velocity dispersions and the line indices can be used to set limits on the allowed variations of ages and metallicities among e and s0 galaxies .",
    "worthey et al .  (",
    "1995 ) found that the mean ages and metallicities derived from the line indices are correlated , in the sense that galaxies with lower mean ages have higher mean metallicities .",
    "the consequence of this relation may be that rather large age and metal variations are present while the low scatter of the scaling relations is maintained . this is discussed in a qualitative sense by worthey et al .",
