    "the l3 detector  @xcite started in 1989 to collect data at lep in @xmath1 collisions at a centre  of  mass energy @xmath4 .",
    "it has contributed to the success of the lepi programme , when more than twenty millions of z bosons were produced testing the standard model of electroweak interactions  @xcite ( sm ) with an impressive precision  @xcite . in",
    "1995 the campaign for the gradual increase of the lep beam energy started , bringing the experiments in the so called lepii era . in the present paper",
    "i will give a snapshot of several l3 results from the high integrated luminosity runs of 1997 and 1998 at an average @xmath5 of @xmath6 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these two energies will be indicated as @xmath7 and @xmath8 hereafter and correspond to 55pb@xmath0 and 176pb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity , respectively .",
    "some of the results described here are published , others are preliminary . results from the lower energy runs at @xmath9 with 10pb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity and @xmath10 with 21pb@xmath0 , are sometimes included in the discussed analyses .",
    "these results , which are only a subsample of the lepii physics program carried out by the l3 experiment , are classified in the following according to the type and number of particles primarily produced in the @xmath11 interactions : two fermions , two w , just one w , two or more photons , one z and a photon and two z. tests of theories of gravity with extra spatial dimensions are finally presented .",
    "fermion pair production is a fundamental process to be studied at lepii both as a verification of sm predictions and as a necessary check of the understanding of the detector performance .",
    "a kinematically favoured configuration in fermion pair production at energies above the z pole is the emission of an hard initial state photon which lowers the effective centre  of  mass energy , @xmath12 , to the z resonance .",
    "this process is known as `` radiative return to the z '' and yields high energy photons either in the detector or almost collinear with the beams and hence undetected .",
    "it is customary to express the results of the cross sections and forward  backward asymmetries of the fermions by separating the full data sample ( @xmath13 ) and the purely high energy one , from which the radiative return to the z events are rejected ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "table  1 reports the l3 results for the two considered energies  @xcite for quark , muon , tau and electron pairs . a good agreement with the sm predictions is observed .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] presents the evolution with @xmath5 of the fermion pair cross section as predicted by the sm and measured by the l3 experiment .    from the analysis of events with a single photon visible in the detector",
    "@xcite it is possible to derive the radiative neutrino pair production cross section . at @xmath8",
    "the measured cross section is : @xmath15 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the extrapolation of this value to the total cross section reads : @xmath16      + channel & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 + @xmath17 & @xmath18&@xmath19 &  &  + @xmath20 & @xmath21&@xmath22 & @xmath23&@xmath24 + @xmath25 & @xmath26&@xmath27 & @xmath28&@xmath29 + @xmath30 & @xmath31&@xmath32 & @xmath33&@xmath34 +   + @xmath17 & @xmath35&@xmath36 &  & ",
    "+ @xmath20 & @xmath37&@xmath38 & @xmath39&@xmath40 + @xmath25 & @xmath41&@xmath42 & @xmath43&@xmath44 + @xmath30 & @xmath45&@xmath46 & @xmath47&@xmath48 +    figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the evolution of these two cross sections as a function of @xmath5 as well as a comparison of @xmath49 with the sm expectations in presence of 2 , 3 or 4 neutrino species . from the photon energy spectrum it is possible to determine the number @xmath50 of light neutrino species as @xmath51 , with respectively statistic and systematic errors",
    "the average of this result with l3 results at the z pole  @xcite yields : @xmath52    the study of fermion pairs constitutes also an interesting probe of possible new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the examples of supersymmetry and contact interactions will be highlighted in the following .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite ( mssm ) introduces a new quantum number , the r  parity  @xcite .",
    "this quantity distinguishes ordinary particles and supersymmetric ones , requiring an even number of the latter in each interaction vertex and hence constraining the lightest supersymmetric particle to be stable . as a consequence of the negative results of the search for supersymmetric particles at the present colliders ,",
    "it is interesting to investigate possible signatures of supersymmetric models with broken r ",
    "parity  @xcite , where triple vertices with a supersymmetric particle and two sm ones are allowed .",
    "some of these signatures are the production of a pair of electrons in @xmath1 collisions mediated by the @xmath53 or @xmath54channel muon or tau sneutrino exchange , the production of a muon pair via the @xmath53channel exchange of a tau sneutrino or that of a tau pair via a muon sneutrino .",
    "these sneutrinos are the scalar partner of the sm neutrinos .",
    "the presence of these processes would lead to a resonant structure in the lepton pair production cross section around the mass of the exchanged sneutrino . from the investigation  @xcite of the cross sections and asymmetries of final states electrons , muons and tau ,",
    "no evidence for such signatures is found and limits at 95% confidence level ( cl ) are derived on the coupling constant of the sneutrino as a function of its mass , as reported in figure  [ fig : snu ] , for the electron and muon signatures .",
    "contact interactions can be thought of as a general formalism to describe new physics from a scale much higher than the energy of an investigated process .",
    "an example is the contact interaction structure used by fermi to describe the beta decay  @xcite fifty years before colliders reached the necessary energy to produce the w boson , whose mass is now known to be the scale of the process .",
    "analogously a new interaction of coupling constant @xmath55 and scale @xmath56 yet far above direct experimental reach can be probed in fermion pair production in @xmath1 interactions .",
    "it is sketched in figure  [ fig : ci ] and is parametrised via an effective lagrangian  @xcite :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the left and right  handed initial state electron and final state fermion fields and the coefficients @xmath60 allow to choose which helicities contribute to the fermion pair production within the different models , as listed in table  2 .",
    "the contact interaction will manifest itself in the differential cross sections of a given phase space parameter as a function of @xmath61 in the interference terms of sm and new physics and as a function of @xmath62 for the pure new physics part .",
    "the search for contact interactions  @xcite proceeds by performing a @xmath63 fit to the charged fermion pair cross sections and asymmetries measurements presented above , with @xmath56 as a free parameter with the convention @xmath64 .",
    "the results of those fits are compatible with the sm for all the possible choices of the helicities and 95% cl limits as high as @xmath65 are set on the scale @xmath56 of some models .",
    "all the limits are presented in figure  [ fig : ci ] , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote respectively the limits in the case of the upper and lower signs of the @xmath68 parameters of table  2 .",
    "lower energy data  @xcite are also included .",
    ".helicities contributions in different models of contact interactions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the analysis  @xcite of the presented distributions as well as hadronic w pair events and @xmath69 pairs , together with the discriminating variables of the zz event selections and the hadronic cross section , no statistically significant hints for lsg are found in the l3 data at @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the 95% cl limits presented in table  4 are set on @xmath70 . assuming that no higher order operators give sizeable contributions to the lsg mediated boson and fermion pair production and that the meaning of the cutoff parameter is the same for all the investigated processes , it is possible to combine the boson and fermion limits .",
    "they are as high as @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 at 95% cl and are competitive with those achieved from a combined analysis of the lepii data  @xcite",
    ".    the l3 collaboration also investigated the direct production of a graviton , lost in the extra dimensions , associated with a photon  @xcite or a z  @xcite .",
    "the phase space favours the first process .",
    "these searches did not not yield any evidence for the expected lsg signatures  @xcite allowing to set 95% cl limits on the lsg scale in excess of @xmath75 .",
    "this walk through part of the recent l3 results shows a quite wide activity , even on subjects that were not expected to be covered at the start of the lepii experimental program  @xcite . on this point",
    "all the experiments match the efforts of the accelerator crew that is impressing the community with record  breaking performance in term of energy , luminosity and operation efficiency .",
    "several important results have been omitted from this review due to the lack of space and the framework of the discussion .",
    "the most important worth mentioning are the 95% cl mass limits on the sm higgs boson at @xmath76  @xcite and that on the lightest mssm neutralino at @xmath77  @xcite , both achieved with the analysis of the full data sample collected by l3 up to @xmath8 .",
    "moreover the l3 experiment has contributed with a large amount of results to the field of two photon physics , as reviewed in reference  @xcite .",
    "let me close this review with the hope that something more than precise cross section measurements and interesting limits is awaiting the lep community in the secrets of the last gev still to be squeezed from the machine in the high energy runs of 1999 up to a centre  of  mass energy of @xmath78 , and even beyond , in the final run of the year 2000 .",
    "i am grateful to my colleagues of the l3 experiment , too numerous to be named here , with whom i shared this challenging physics adventure since i arrived at cern as an undergraduate student , through the end of the century .",
    "it is only with the lively daily interaction with many of them on several of the subjects i described in this work , that i learned something about experimental high energy physics .",
    "i wish to thank the organisers of this conference in particular for having helped me to find a swimming pool on the leninskii prospekt and to fix some complex part of my travel arrangements , two tasks at more than 95% cl beyond the reach of my russian phrase book .",
