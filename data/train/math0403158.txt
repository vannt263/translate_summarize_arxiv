    "to produce an optimal solution to tietze s extension problem in general metrically convex compact metric space , we have introduced a class @xmath2 of extension schemes which solve the problem @xcite .    in this paper",

    "unfortunately it is generally hopeless to obtain a numerical approximation of this solution on , say , a regular grid of step @xmath6 by discretisation of @xmath2 on this grid .",
    "in fact , by such a discretisation we obtain an extension which is lipschitz - optimal not for euclidean metric but only for the geodesic metric on the grid .    to overcome this difficulty we introduce in this paper an explicit scheme of extension valid on any finite network contained in the considered metrically convex compact metric space and prove that the extension converges to an amle when the network suitably densifies the metric space .",
    "as a consequence , assuming jensen s hypotheses @xcite , we obtain numerical approximations of the solution of viscosity of @xmath1 under dirichlet s condition .",
    "note here that a. oberman @xcite has obtained very similar numerical approximations in @xmath0 , based upon the same numerical scheme , proposing a proof of the convergence of the scheme based upon the @xmath8approach of the problem .    in the whole paper @xmath9 denotes a metrically convex compact metric space that is a compact lenght space with the terminology of ( @xcite , appendix ) .",
