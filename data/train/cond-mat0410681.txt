    "in recent years there has been great interest in coherent quantum transport in mesoscopic devices in both experiment and theory ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in quantum systems",
    "whose classical dynamics is chaotic , phase coherence and quantum interference give rise to sample - to - sample fluctuations in most transport properties with respect to small perturbations in incident energy , cavity shape , or an external parameter such as an applied magnetic field .",
    "therefore an statistical analysis by random - matrix theory ( rmt ) becomes applicable ; the details of the problem being irrelevant emphasis must be put on universal aspects such as the symmetries of the system . then , time - reversal invariance ( tri ) and spin - rotational symmetries @xcite , or the spatial symmetries present in the system characterize their universal statistics @xcite .",
    "some experiments concerned with the parametric dependence of the conductance study ballistic quantum dots connected by leads with few propagating modes to electron reservoirs , as happens in semiconductor systems @xcite . the conductance is measured as a function of the magnetic field and the shape of the quantum dot ( controlled by gate voltages ) .",
    "the derivative of the conductance with respect to an external parameter , which is analogous to the level velocity @xcite of the dot , is a very important quantity that gives us the response of a mesoscopic sample to a small perturbation .",
    "only the asymmetrical situation has been considered in the literature using an rmt approach @xcite .",
    "other methods to verify rmt predictions are given by wave scattering experiments , such as microwaves @xcite and acoustic resonators @xcite .",
    "in the microwave technique , for example , the conductance is measured as a function of the frequency of incidence , applied magnetic field , and cavity shape .    in these wave scattering experiments",
    "the external parameters are easier to control .",
    "the symmetric case can be constructed to analyze the strong effects of spatial symmetries on the conductance , predicted by rmt @xcite .",
    "experiments have been conducted on left - right symmetric cavities @xcite .",
    "however , no theoretical results exist for the distribution of the conductance velocities .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the spatial left - right symmetry in the distribution of the parametric derivative of the conductance .",
    "thus , we consider a chaotic left - right symmetric cavity connected to two symmetrically located leads for two different symmetries , with and without tri , in the absence of an applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "other spatial symmetries @xcite are not considered .    when tri is broken by a magnetic field the problem of left - right symmetric cavities is mapped to the one of asymmetric cavities in the presence of tri .",

    "the statistical distributions @xmath9 , @xmath6 show algebraic tails , and in the absence ( presence ) of tri they have a cusp ( divergence ) at zero velocity , and the second moment is finite ( infinite ) .",
