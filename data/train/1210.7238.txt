    "the inspiral and coalescence of neutron star binaries ( ns - ns ) are the most likely astrophysical sources for direct detection with the upcoming advanced networks of ground - based gravitational wave ( gw ) interferometers , such as advanced ligo and virgo ( hereafter aligo / virgo ; @xcite ) . maximizing the science achievable from such detections",
    "will require the identification and localization of an associated electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart ( e.g. , , hereafter mb12 ) .",
    "the em - gw link is crucial for identifying the host galaxy and distance of the merger , for placing the mergers in an astrophysical context , for studying the hydrodynamics of matter during the merger process , and potentially for lifting degeneracies associated with the inferred binary parameters ( e.g. , , @xcite ) .",
    "one commonly - discussed em counterpart of ns - ns mergers is a short - duration gamma - ray burst ( grb ) ; see @xcite and @xcite for evidence favoring this association .",
    "unfortunately , on - axis short grbs occur at a low rate of @xmath12 yr@xmath6 within the @xmath2 mpc range for ns - ns detections by aligo / virgo ( @xcite ; @xcite ; mb12 ) , so the joint detection of a short grb with a gw event is expected to be rare .",
    "more isotropic optical counterparts , such as an off - axis grb afterglow ( @xcite ; ; mb12 ) or supernova - like emission powered by the decay of radioactive ejecta ( `` kilonova '' ; ) , may instead represent more promising counterparts for the bulk of gw - detected events ( mb12 ) ; the typical timescale for these counterparts is a few days .",
    "delayed radio emission , powered by the interaction of ( non-)relativistic ejecta with the surrounding environment , may also be detectable if the merger occurs in a sufficiently dense medium , with a timescale of months to decades .",
    "regardless of physical origin , a major challenge to identifying em counterparts is the expected poor sky localizations of @xmath13 deg@xmath1 for networks of gw detectors @xcite . in the optical band ,",
    "this large area will necessitate deep and rapid follow - up with wide - field survey instruments .",
    "still , an even greater challenge may be the large number of false positives in these wide fields ( e.g. , background supernovae , m dwarf flares , shock break - out events , agn flares ; see ; mb12 ; @xcite ) . given the rapid evolution of the predicted optical signal , such false positives need to be quickly eliminated so that candidate counterparts could be followed up with deeper photometry or spectroscopy before the transient fades .",
    "although rapid follow - up is not as essential at radio frequencies , false positives could also be of concern in this case ( e.g. , radio supernovae , tidal disruption events , agn flares ) , given the poorer angular resolution of wide - field radio survey instruments and our lack of knowledge about the transient radio sky on the timescales and depths of the expected merger counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the contamination from false positives could be reduced by restricting the search volume to locations near galaxies within the sensitivity range of aligo / virgo ( @xmath14 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has the potential to reduce the search area from tens of square degrees to @xmath15 deg@xmath16 , and hence to reduce the number of false positives by a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "however , to implement this strategy with success , the census of local galaxies must be reasonably accurate and complete .",
    "unfortunately , this is currently not the case : the galaxy catalogs used for recent ligo / virgo gw follow - up ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are estimated to be only @xmath18 complete ( with respect to @xmath19-band luminosity ) at 100 mpc @xcite , in which case the true counterpart ( most likely at a larger distance ) could easily be missed .",
    "furthermore , although @xmath19-band completeness is a reasonable proxy for the ns - ns merger population if the latter traces current star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , completeness with respect to stellar mass is also relevant if a sizable fraction of mergers occur in early - type galaxies with older stellar populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we compare two approaches for completing the local galaxy catalog .",
    "the first strategy is a narrow - band h@xmath3  survey ( @xmath20 ) , an idea that has been discussed previously ( e.g. , @xcite ) but is fleshed out in detail here .",
    "the other strategy , explored here for the first time , is a wide - field  survey ( @xmath21 ) , as is already being planned as a main science driver for future wide - field radio arrays .",
    "our main conclusion is that neither h@xmath3  nor  surveys of planned sensitivity are sufficient to fully complete the galaxy catalog , especially with respect to stellar mass .",
    "however , even with respect to star formation completeness , an h@xmath3  survey suffers from a significant loss of flux ( and hence sensitivity and completeness ) from spatially resolving the disks of the galaxies and from the effects of balmer absorption in the underlying stellar continuum . in @xmath22",
    "we discuss the merits of combining h@xmath3  and  surveys , and explore the relevance of our results in the context of the host galaxies of short grbs ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "most studies in the past have assumed that the rate of ns - ns mergers in the local universe traces @xmath19-band luminosity @xcite , as would be expected if the rate of mergers is proportional to the current star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "this naturally led to consideration of narrow - band h@xmath3  imaging surveys to complete the local galaxy catalog since h@xmath3  emission is closely tied to on - going star formation activity ( e.g. , ) and imaging surveys can efficiently identify and help characterize galaxies in a given redshift range @xcite . in this section",
    "we address the completeness of such a survey as a function of depth in terms of star formation and stellar mass , and discuss the associated challenges .",
    "we first note that while sfr is certainly an important quantity , it is also possible that a sizable fraction of mergers instead trace total stellar mass , as determined by the distribution of merger times and the star formation history ( @xcite ; see figure 11 of @xcite ) .",
    "find evidence from the host galaxies of short grbs that mergers may track a combination of sfr and stellar mass , in rough analogy with type ia sne ( e.g. , ) .",
    "given this possibility , in what follows we explore completeness with respect to both stellar mass and sfr independently .",
    "in addressing the issue of h@xmath3  completeness we pursue an empirical approach , rather than directly making use of derived relations between h@xmath3  luminosity and various galaxy properties .",
    "our primary source of data are galaxy catalogs with measured h@xmath3  fluxes ( @xmath24 ) provided by the mpa - jhu emission line analysis from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "each galaxy is characterized by a stellar mass ( determined by photometric modeling ; @xcite ) and sfr ( determined from emission lines ; @xcite ) .",
    "we correct the measured h@xmath3  fluxes to account for the finite angular size of the spectroscopic fiber relative to the galaxy by scaling the fluxes by the difference of the total @xmath25-band magnitude ( keyword ` r_petro ` ) to that contained in the spectroscopic fiber ( keyword ` r_fiber ` ) , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this assumes uniform h@xmath3  surface brightness ( see below for further discussion ) and allows us to study the completeness achieved by an idealized survey that picks up the entire h@xmath3 flux from the galaxy",
    ". we also increase the quoted flux errors by a factor of 2.47 ( as suggested by the mpa - jhu pipeline ) and set a conservative threshold on the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath26 for an h@xmath3  detection ; values with @xmath27 are treated as upper limits .",
    "finally , we remove all galaxies with `` flagged '' sfrs ( keyword ` flagsfr ` = 0 ) or redshifts ( keyword ` z_warning ` = 1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ha_complete ] shows our results for the fraction ( `` completeness '' ) of the total stellar mass ( _ red _ ) and sfr ( _ blue _ ) within 200 mpc as a function of the survey flux depth ( @xmath28 ) for an idealized spectroscopic survey .",
    "completeness is calculated as the fraction of the total sfr or the total stellar mass in all galaxies with @xmath29 , normalized to the total sfr or mass of all galaxies in the redshift range @xmath30 .",
    "as the flux limit decreases below a @xmath31 erg s@xmath6 @xmath32 the completeness becomes increasingly uncertain ( shown by the hatched uncertainty bands ) , as increasing fractions of galaxies have only upper limits on @xmath24 .",
    "the miminum ( maximum ) completeness in this case is calculated by assuming that none ( all ) would be detections at @xmath33 .",
    "an idealized survey to a depth @xmath34 erg s@xmath6 @xmath32 ( a luminosity of @xmath35 erg s@xmath6 at 200 mpc ) , as could be reached with a few minute integration per pointing on a meter - class telescope such as the palomar transient factory @xcite , could achieve a completeness of @xmath36 with respect to sfr , but only @xmath37 with respect to total stellar mass . it is not surprising that @xmath38 given the known correlation between h@xmath3  luminosity and sfr @xcite .",
    "lower completeness with respect to stellar mass is consistent with the fact that @xmath18 of mass in the local universe is in early - type galaxies @xcite , while they account for only @xmath39% of the h@xmath3luminosity density at @xmath14 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    for comparison in figure  [ fig : ha_complete ]",
    "we also plot the completeness with respect to @xmath19-band luminosity using data from the 11hugs survey of galaxies at @xmath40 mpc @xcite , and with respect to total h@xmath3  luminosity ( using the @xmath41 h@xmath3luminosity function from @xcite ; cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath19-band completeness ( @xmath42 ) tracks closer to sfr than to stellar mass , with @xmath43 completeness at @xmath44 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "this is not unexpected , as blue light tracks ongoing star formation , although not as tightly as h@xmath3  luminosity .",
    "the estimates of mass and sfr completeness in figure  [ fig : ha_complete ] are only appropriate for an idealized survey , such as that realized through direct spectroscopy of the target galaxies ( as in sdss ) , but with infinite aperture . for an actual imaging surveys , absorption in the underlying stellar continuum can reduce the perceived h@xmath3  flux when integrated over a filter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while for young star - forming galaxies this will generally be a minor correction @xcite , the correction can be significant for early - type galaxies . in figure  [ fig:3spectra ]",
    "we show a comparison between the sdss spectra of three galaxies with similar h@xmath3  fluxes , but where the integrated flux in a narrow - band h@xmath3 filter is reduced by increasing amounts of balmer absorption from the stellar continuum . in the bottom spectrum ,",
    "the h@xmath3  equivalent width ( ew ) is much greater than the correction due to stellar absorption ( ew@xmath45 ) , in which case the galaxy would be detected regardless of the effects of stellar absorption .",
    "however , in the top spectrum ew and ew@xmath45 are comparable , and the galaxy might escape detection in a narrow - band imaging survey .    to explore",
    "what completeness could be achieved by an actual imaging survey that can not correct the h@xmath3  fluxes for stellar absorption , we recalculated the minimum mass and sfr completeness using the fluxes from sdss which are instead calculated from the line equivalent widths computed via integration over broad wavelength ranges .",
    "the results are shown with dashed lines in figure [ fig : ha_complete ] .",
    "although the effect on sfr completeness @xmath46 is relatively minor ( less than a few percent , and comparable to the corrections considered in @xcite ) , the completeness with respect to stellar mass decreases to @xmath47 .",
    "this difference arises because balmer absorption is strong and h@xmath3  is weak in galaxies with relatively old stellar populations and low levels of star formation activity , i.e. , those that contribute to stellar mass but not sfr completeness .",
    "another challenge of a realistic survey is that nearby galaxies generally have angular sizes larger than the typical point - spread - function of a ground - based imaging survey .",
    "this effect can reduce the effective survey sensitivity compared to that for point sources ( i.e. , the survey is actually defined by a limiting surface brightness instead of a limiting flux ) .",
    "the actual correction between limiting surface brightness and limiting flux depends on the background noise level , the typical seeing , and the distribution of galaxy sizes . in figure",
    "[ fig : radii ] we show the distribution of effective angular radii ( @xmath48 ) of all galaxies in our sample , where @xmath49 is the @xmath50 radius spectral aperture of sdss .",
    "a significant number of sources have radii of @xmath51 , meaning that they will cover @xmath52 seeing disks for typical conditions , although this will be somewhat mitigated by the fact that h@xmath3  typically comes from localized regions which have higher - than - average surface brightnesses .",
    "we include the effects of balmer absorption and the galaxy size distribution to determine more realistic completeness fractions .",
    "we use the uncorrected sdss h@xmath3  fluxes ( i.e. , not scaling the h@xmath3  fluxes by the total @xmath25-band magnitude , as described above ) .",
    "this gives an effective seeing disk of @xmath50 , comparable to typical ground - based observing conditions , and basically assumes that the h@xmath3 flux outside the central portion is below the detectability threshold .",
    "we recompute the stellar mass and sfr completeness using this pessimistic ( `` imaging '' ) scenario , and the resulting minimum completeness are shown with solid lines in figure  [ fig : ha_complete ] . for a ( point source ) luminosity @xmath53 erg s@xmath6 , the sfr completeness",
    "is reduced to @xmath54 , while the stellar mass completeness is @xmath8 .    in table",
    "[ table : surveycompare ] we summarize the relevant completeness values .",
    "we give three values for the h@xmath3  survey , as discussed above .",
    "the first corresponds to our ideal survey , where there is no balmer absorption and all of the flux from extended sources is recovered .",
    "the other two ( realistic ) sets include balmer absorption , with the optimistic version still assuming that all of the flux from extended sources is recovered , and the pessimistic version assuming that none of the flux from extended sources is recovered ; the true value likely is between these last two versions , i.e.  @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "another strategy to complete the local galaxy catalog is via a wide - field  ( 21 cm ) emission line survey , looking for neutral rather than ionized gas .",
    "we are motivated in particular by the planned widefield askap @xmath57-band legacy all - sky blind survey ( wallaby ; e.g. , @xcite ) , which plans to observe @xmath58 of the sky ( declination of @xmath59 to @xmath60 ) over a timescale of @xmath61 year and detect about a half - million galaxies to @xmath62 with an estimated rms sensitivity ( over a 100 khz bandwidth ) of @xmath63 mjy .",
    "below we examine to what extent wallaby will be effective at completing the local galaxy catalog . throughout",
    "we assume that  luminosity ( @xmath64 ) scales with gas mass ( @xmath65 ) as @xmath66 @xcite , neglecting self - absorption ( a good approximation ; @xcite ) . determining the threshold for a given survey",
    "also requires assumptions about the velocity widths and inclinations of the galaxies . for our purposes",
    "we assume the limiting flux density and linewidth above , which are sufficient to detect @xmath67 at a distance of 200 mpc at @xmath68 significance @xcite .    as in the case of h@xmath3 , we opt for an empirical approach to estimate the achievable completeness with respect to stellar mass and sfr .",
    "we are limited by the absence of a single large sample of galaxies with measured  masses ( or upper limits ) , stellar masses , and sfrs , yet which is unbiased with respect to galaxy population .",
    "for this reason , we use several different  catalogs to explore completeness with respect to stellar mass and sfr ( see figure  [ fig : mstar_hi ] for the  masses and stellar masses ) .    to study completeness among star forming galaxies",
    ", we use  masses from the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ; @xcite ) with sdss counterparts ( for which stellar mass and sfr are available as described in @xmath20 ) in the redshift range @xmath69 .",
    "although the entire alfalfa sample is large ( about 9000 galaxies ) and covers a wide range in stellar mass ( @xmath70 m@xmath71 ) it is biased towards star forming galaxies and contains only sdss counterparts with  detections .",
    "a complementary data set is the galex arecibo sdss survey ( gass ; @xcite ) , which is much smaller ( @xmath72 galaxies following our cuts ) but also contains deep  upper limits ( down to hi masses of a few percent of the stellar mass ) .",
    "unfortunately , even gass does not represent a fair sample of the entire galaxy population since it is restricted to massive galaxies ( @xmath73 m@xmath71 ) , which for example only account for about half of the short grb hosts ; see figure  [ fig : mstar_hi ] .",
    "for this reason , we also use  masses and upper limits from the herschel reference survey ( hrs ; @xcite ) , a volume limited sample at @xmath74 mpc @xcite that covers a relatively broad range in stellar masses ( @xmath75 m@xmath71 ) , covering most of the short grb host galaxies .    in figure  [",
    "fig : hi_complete ] we show our results for the completeness achievable by an all - sky  survey with respect to total sfr @xmath76 ( _ blue _ ) and stellar mass @xmath77 ( _ red _ ) , as a function of survey limiting flux ( @xmath78 ) , calculated using the gass sample ( also see table  [ table : surveycompare ] ) . for mass completeness , we also show the hrs sample ( _ orange _ ) .",
    "note that as in the case of h@xmath3 , completeness is uncertain at low fluxes as the result of  upper limits , as indicated by the hatched regions .",
    "we find that a survey similar to wallaby could achieve an sfr completeness of @xmath79 , but only @xmath80 with respect to total stellar mass .",
    "for mass completeness we quote numbers from hrs instead of gass , since hrs samples a wider range of galaxy masses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar_hi ] ) .",
    "again , a high sfr completeness is expected given the correlation between cold gas mass and sfr @xcite .",
    "lower completeness with respect to stellar mass is expected since early - type galaxies are typically deficient in  @xcite yet they contain @xmath18 of mass in the local universe @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we also shows completeness with respect to total  mass ( as determined from the local luminosity function of @xcite ) , which is found to lie between that of stellar mass and sfr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hi_complete ] ; table  [ table : surveycompare ] ) .",
    "as we discussed in the context of h@xmath3  surveys , for  surveys we should also consider the possible detrimental effect of spatially resolving the galaxies .",
    "however , the poorer angular resolution of askap ( @xmath81 ) makes this less of an issue than for an optical survey , and the expected effect on detectability is anticipated to be minimal ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the limited angular resolution of the  surveys will not affect the follow - up of gw triggers , as a @xmath82 position would be quite sufficient and the  centroid will be known to even better precision .",
    "ideally , candidate galaxies detected by wallaby will also be followed up to obtain optical counterparts by wide - field survey instruments such as vista hemispheric survey @xcite , vst atlas @xcite , or skymapper @xcite .",
    "table  [ table : surveycompare ] compares the minimum completeness to sfr and stellar mass achieved by our fiducial h@xmath3  and  surveys based on figures  [ fig : ha_complete ] and [ fig : hi_complete ] .",
    "overall we find that when considering realistic surveys including the effects of balmer absorption and finite source sizes , an  survey can achieve a somewhat better completeness in both sfr and @xmath4 compared to h@xmath3 .",
    "it is clear from our results that neither the proposed h@xmath3  or surveys will produce a local galaxy catalog that is entirely complete with respect to stellar mass out to 200 mpc .",
    "fundamentally , both h@xmath3and  trace gas , while @xmath18 of stellar mass in the local universe is in early - type galaxies @xcite with little gas .",
    "however , even completeness with respect to sfr is unlikely to reach @xmath83 from either survey due to the issues discussed in @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a remaining question is whether there are any advantages to combining the results of separate h@xmath3  and  surveys . in figure",
    "[ fig : halpha_hi ] we show @xmath84 versus @xmath65 from the alfalfa - sdss sample of star forming galaxies .",
    "we note that an obvious correlation exists between @xmath65 and @xmath85 since both trace star formation , but there is also a large scatter ( @xmath86 dex ) in the correlation where the sensitivity threshold of wallaby ( @xmath87 m@xmath88 at 200 mpc ) intersects that of our fiducial h@xmath3  survey ( @xmath89 erg s@xmath6 at 200 mpc ) .",
    "this scatter implies that some fraction of galaxies which are just below the detection threshold in  will be detectable in h@xmath3  and vice versa .",
    "therefore the sfr completeness attained by combining the results of both h@xmath3  and  surveys together should be more than that of either individually .    if one were to combine  and h@xmath3 surveys , which individually achieve a similar completeness ( as is the case for wallaby and our ` ideal ' spectroscopic h@xmath3 survey ) but not ) of figure [ fig : halpha_hi ] than in the bottom - right ( detected in  but not h@xmath3 ) appears at odds with the comparable completeness attained by our fiducial  and spectroscopic h@xmath3  surveys ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ha_complete ] , [ fig : hi_complete ] ) ; however , the alfalfa sample includes only  detections and hence overestimates the fraction of -detected galaxies .",
    "] , then from the sdss - alfalfa sample we estimate that @xmath90 could be increased from @xmath91 to @xmath92 . mass completeness could be increased by a somewhat greater amount ( changing by up to @xmath93 ) , however @xmath94 is ultimately limited to a value @xmath95 due to the fraction of early - type galaxies which possess neither detectable  or h@xmath3 emission .",
    "we conclude that combining surveys provides the greatest benefit if both  and h@xmath3 surveys separately achieve a similar completeness , however even in this case the gains will be relatively modest .",
    "so far we have focused on completeness with respect to sfr and stellar mass separately .",
    "however , it is also of interest to investigate how complete the h@xmath3  or  surveys will be with respect to the known population of short grb host galaxies .",
    "we attempt to answer this question empirically by investigating the fraction of galaxies with properties ( sfr or stellar mass @xmath4 ) similar to those of the short grb hosts that would be detected in h@xmath3  or .    in our calculation",
    "we use short grb host galaxy masses from and sfrs ( or upper limits ) from @xcite , resulting in a sample of 11 galaxies .",
    "we define the ` short grb host completeness ' as the fraction of galaxies in our sample that have masses ( and in some cases sfrs ) within a factor of @xmath96 0.5 dex of those of each short grb host and that are detectable at a given h@xmath3  or  flux , the result of which is then averaged over the short grb hosts . in the case of h@xmath3 , the galaxy masses , sfrs , and h@xmath3  fluxes are again taken from the sdss sample ( @xmath20 ) , the latter of which are not corrected for stellar absorption or galaxy size ( as would characterize a purely imaging survey ) . in the case of we use galaxy masses from the hrs sample , but we can not make a cut on the sfr since these data are not available .",
    "figure [ fig : shortgrbcomplete ] shows our results for completeness as a function of h@xmath3  or  flux , normalized to the sensitivity of our fiducial surveys . in the case of h@xmath3 , results are shown for two cases : ( 1 ) in which the galaxy samples are chosen to match both the masses and sfrs of the short grb hosts , and ( 2 ) in a case for which the samples are chosen based just on sharing similar stellar masses with the short grb hosts . by this criteria , we find that our fiducial h@xmath3  imaging survey could achieve a short grb host completeness of @xmath97 and @xmath98 in cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively .",
    "case ( 1 ) is more realistic and results in a higher completeness because most of the short grb hosts ( 9 of 11 ) are star - forming galaxies , so the sfr cut preferentially picks out h@xmath3-luminous galaxies . in both cases the minimum completeness asymptotes to @xmath99 at low fluxes since 2 of 11 of the short grb hosts are early - type galaxies , for which there are only upper limits on their sfrs and h@xmath3 luminosities .    in the case of",
    ", we find that our fiducial survey similar to wallaby could achieve a completeness of @xmath100 .",
    "however , this probably underestimates the true completeness for the same reason as with h@xmath3 : most of short grb hosts are star - forming and there is a correlation between sfr and  mass ( @xcite ) , yet no cut was made on sfr .",
    "we conclude that both h@xmath3  and  surveys could achieve at least @xmath101 completion with respect to grb host galaxies , although this number is likely to be substantially higher in the case of an  survey .",
    "there is room to increase the completeness by performing a deeper search than our fiducial survey , potentially approaching the @xmath102 maximum completeness expected if one could detect all 9 of 11 star - forming short grb hosts at @xmath103 200 mpc .",
    "we used observed samples of nearby galaxies , drawn from sdss and augmented by  data from several surveys , to estimate the completeness of fiducial h@xmath3  and  surveys to sfr and stellar mass out to a distance of 200 mpc .",
    "we conclude that neither  nor h@xmath3surveys to proposed depths will be entirely effective at completing the local galaxy catalog with respect to stellar mass within 200 mpc , but that we can expect reasonable completenesses of @xmath54 , @xmath8 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . at this point neither the large - scale h@xmath3  nor  surveys discussed here are underway , and it may be possible to alter the strategy ( i.e. , survey depth ) to increase the completeness .",
    "for instance , halving the survey threshold of the fiducial h@xmath3 imaging survey results in a substantial increase in the completenesses to @xmath106 , @xmath107 , but for  only results in a modest increase to @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "for h@xmath3 , these increases are comparable to that achieved by pursuing a spectroscopic survey ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ha_complete ] ) .",
    "such a deeper survey would also increase the completeness with respect to short grb host galaxies by @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shortgrbcomplete ] ) .    if the survey thresholds remain as discussed here , assessing whether or not this is a concern for aligo / virgo follow - up largely depends on the fraction of mergers that occur in early - type galaxies .",
    "if the host galaxies of short grbs indeed represent a faithful sampling of the merger population , then the current census of about a 5 to 1 ratio of star forming to elliptical hosts @xcite would suggest that incompleteness of early - type galaxies is not a major concern . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that short grbs do not represent all mergers , or that the short grb host population is biased against early - type galaxies .",
    "current population synthesis models do allow for a sizable fraction @xmath111 of elliptical hosts at @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "we note that our treatment of the surveys used simply - defined empirical data sets , and some secondary effects may change the results slightly .",
    "for instance , neither the h@xmath3  flux nor the balmer absorption is expected to be distributed uniformly within the galaxies .",
    "while we do not think that effects such as these will greatly change our conclusions , future studies could be done with more carefully constructed samples or could make use of observed semi - empirical correlations between galaxy properties to directly calculate the completeness .",
