    "determining the properties of strongly interacting matter at high temperature , the temperature at which the transition to the quark - gluon plasma phase takes place as well as other critical parameters , is one of the basic goals in lattice studies of finite - t qcd .",
    "numerical calculations which have been performed during the last years have shown that the details of the transition strongly depend on the number of quark flavors ( @xmath4 ) as well as the value of e.g. the pseudo - scalar meson mass ( @xmath5 ) which is controlled by the bare quark masses ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "furthermore , it became evident that the moderate values of the lattice spacing ( @xmath7fm ) used in finite - t calculations with dynamical fermions lead to sizeable cut - off effects ; different discretization schemes used in the fermion sector , e.g. the standard staggered and wilson fermion formulation , lead to significantly different results for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "calculations with improved actions thus seem to be mandatory to obtain reliable quantitative results for @xmath8 and its dependence on @xmath4 as well as @xmath5 .",
    "we will report here on results for @xmath9 and 3 obtained with a symanzik improved gauge action and a staggered fermion action with improved rotational invariance , _",
    "i.  e. _ the p4-action with fat 1-link terms .",
    "this action has been used previously by us in studies of the flavor dependence of the qcd thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "further details on the action and the algorithm used for our simulations are given in @xcite .",
    "for a discussion of recent results with improved wilson fermions see ref .  @xcite .",
    "the transition temperature in qcd with dynamical fermions has been found to be significantly smaller than in the pure gauge sector .",
    "this is in accordance with intuitive pictures of the phase transition based for instance on the thermodynamics of bag or percolation models . with decreasing",
    "@xmath6 hadrons become lighter and it becomes easier to build up a sufficiently high particle density that can trigger a phase transition .",
    "for the same reason such models also suggest that @xmath8 decreases when @xmath4 and in turn the number of light pseudo - scalar mesons increases .",
    "this general picture is confirmed by the lattice results presented in the following .",
    "we have calculated the pseudo - critical couplings , @xmath10 , for the transition to the qcd plasma phase on lattices of size @xmath11 .",
    "calculations have been performed for 2 and 3-flavor qcd in a wide range of quark masses , @xmath12 .",
    "the smallest quark mass value corresponds to @xmath13  mev .    in order to set a scale for the transition temperature we have performed calculations of the light meson spectrum and the string tensionfm . ] at @xmath10 on lattices of size @xmath14 .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crit_temp ] .",
    "we note that @xmath15 and @xmath16 do show a consistent flavor dependence of @xmath8 . in a wide range of quark mass values @xmath8 in 3-flavor",
    "qcd is about 10% smaller than for @xmath3 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 is , however , quite different when using the vector meson mass rather than the string tension to set the scale for @xmath8 .",
    "while @xmath15 does show the expected rise with increasing @xmath6 the contrary is the case for @xmath16 . of course",
    ", this does not come as a surprise .",
    "the vector meson mass used in fig .",
    "[ fig : crit_temp ] to set the scale is itself strongly quark mass dependent , @xmath17 .",
    "its mass thus is significantly larger than the vector meson mass , @xmath18 , in the chiral limit .",
    "we stress this well known fact here because it makes evident that one has to be careful when discussing the dependence of @xmath8 on parameters of the qcd lagrangian , e.g. @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "one has to make sure that the observable used to set the scale for @xmath8 itself is not or at most only weakly dependent on the external parameters .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_rho ] we show results for the ratio @xmath19 calculated on @xmath14 lattices for various values of the quark mass in 2 , ( 2 + 1 ) and 3-flavor qcd .",
    "also shown there is the result obtained in quenched qcd as well as from a partially quenched calculation which we have performed on gauge field configurations generated with a dynamical ( sea ) quark mass of @xmath20 . the fact that this ratio shows only little flavor dependence and that the ( partially ) quenched limit is in reasonable agreement with experiment and phenomenology indicates that the corresponding partially quenched observables are suitable also for setting the scale in the presence of dynamical quarks .",
    "physically most relevant is an analysis of the thermodynamics of qcd with 2 light ( @xmath22 ) and a heavier ( strange ) quark with @xmath23 .",
    "calculations of bulk thermodynamic observables ( pressure , energy density ) suggest that the explicit quark mass dependence is small above @xmath8 . in particular , a recent calculation of the pressure with @xmath24 and @xmath25 has shown that deviations from the case with three degenerate quarks are only about @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this difference would be even smaller when @xmath27 rather than @xmath28 would have been kept fixed in the simulation .",
    "one thus can expect that already for @xmath29 bulk thermodynamics of the plasma phase will be well described by the equation of state of 3 degenerate , nearly massless flavors .",
    "this is different close to the transition which in the ( 2 + 1)-flavor case presumably is just a rapid crossover .",
    "although this analysis has not yet been performed with a sufficiently light light quark sector the result for the pseudo - critical temperature shown in fig .",
    "1 suggests that @xmath8 is close to that of 2-flavor qcd .      in fig .  1 we also show results for @xmath8 obtained with the standard , unimproved gauge and staggered fermion actions .",
    "we note that on lattices with temporal extent @xmath0 this action leads to systematically smaller values for @xmath15 as well as @xmath16 .",
    "this provides an estimate for systematic cut - off effects , which for a wide range of quark mass values seem to be about @xmath26 .",
    "such an estimate also is consistent with the observation that for large values of @xmath30 calculations with unimproved fermion actions do lead to larger critical temperatures .",
    "statistical errors are , however , large in this case .",
    "we thus expect that our current analysis with improved gauge and staggered fermion actions is affected with systematic cut - off effects which are significantly below the @xmath26 level .",
    "however , this clearly has to be checked with simulations on larger lattices .",
    "for @xmath31 the chiral phase transition is known to be first order @xcite whereas it is most likely a continuous transition for @xmath3 .",
    "this also implies that the dependence of the ( pseudo)-critical temperature on the quark mass will differ in both cases .",
    "asymptotically , _",
    "i.e. _ to leading order in the quark mass one expects to find ,    @xmath32    with @xmath33 if the 2-flavor transition indeed belongs to the universality class of 3d , o(4 ) symmetric spin models .",
    "our estimates of @xmath8 in the chiral limit are based on the data shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for @xmath31 we have extrapolated @xmath15 and @xmath16 using an ansatz quadratic in @xmath34 .",
    "in addition we have extrapolated @xmath35 calculated at @xmath10 for @xmath36 and 0.05 linearly in @xmath6 to the critical point in the chiral limit , @xmath37 .",
    "the extrapolation to the chiral limit is less straightforward in the case of @xmath3 .",
    "the data shown in fig .  1 indicate that the quark mass dependence for @xmath3 and 3 is quite similar .",
    "this suggests that sub - leading corrections , quadratic in @xmath38 , should be taken into account in addition to the leading behavior expected from universality . in our extrapolations for @xmath3",
    "we thus also add a term quadratic in @xmath34 to the leading term given in eq .  1 .",
    "[ fig : histo_em ]    from these fits we estimate @xmath39 which corresponds to @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath3 and 3 , respectively . for @xmath3",
    "this agrees well with results obtained in a calculation with improved wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that the errors given here as well as in ref .",
    "3 are statistical only .",
    "systematic errors resulting from remaining cut - off effects and from the ansatz used for extrapolating to the chiral limit are expected to be of similar magnitude . in order to control these errors calculations on lattices with larger temporal extent are still needed .",
    "the first order chiral transition of 3-flavor qcd will persist to be first order for @xmath42 up to a critical value of the quark mass . at this _ chiral critical point _",
    "the transition will be second order and it has been conjectured that it belongs to the universality class of the 3d ising model @xcite . from a simulation with standard , _",
    "i.e. _ unimproved , gauge and staggered fermion actions we find support for this conjecture .",
    "the analysis of the critical behavior at the @xmath43 order endpoint of a line of @xmath44 order phase transitions requires the correct identification of energy - like and ordering - field ( magnetic ) directions @xcite .",
    "the ordering field at the critical point can be constructed from a linear combination of the gluonic action @xmath45 and the chiral condensate @xmath46 , @xmath47 here the mixing parameter @xmath48 is determined from the @xmath6-dependence of the line of first order transitions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 by demanding @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , unlike for energy - like observables , e.g. critical amplitudes that involve the thermal exponent @xmath52 , the universal properties of observables related to @xmath53 do not depend on the correct choice of the mixing parameter @xmath50 as long as the magnetic exponent @xmath54 is larger than @xmath52 .",
    "the joint probability distribution for @xmath55 and @xmath53 characterizes the symmetry at the critical endpoint and its universality class .",
    "contour plots for the normalized @xmath55-@xmath53 distributions at the critical endpoints of 3-flavor qcd and the 3d , 3-state potts model as well as the corresponding plot for the @xmath45-@xmath56 distribution are given in fig .",
    "this shows that also in the qcd case a proper definition of energy - like and ordering - field operators is needed to reveal the symmetry properties of the chiral critical point .",
    "the joint distributions of @xmath55 and @xmath53 suggest the universal structure of the @xmath55-@xmath53 probability distribution of the 3-d ising model @xcite , although it is apparent that an analysis of 3-flavor qcd on larger lattices is needed to clearly see the `` two wings '' characteristic for the 3d ising distribution .",
