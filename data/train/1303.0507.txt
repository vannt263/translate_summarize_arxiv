    "is dominated by the load s noise temperature - realistically qpc shot noise - while at low power transfer and in the second case the dominant contribution originates from the amplifier - which is the case for low qpc bias or comparably large amplifier noise .",

    "this follows from the suppression of @xmath51 with @xmath3 .",
    "if the matching network adds a considerable amount of thermal noise the snr is poorer , which can be particularly painful at low power transfer .",

    "( [ eq : ksimplepozar ] ) ) , we obtain @xmath68 where the last approximation is valid if @xmath69 .",
    "we can also estimate the increase in snr expected for experiments carried out in a dilution refrigerator as compared to a variable - temperature insert at 2 k ; for a fixed amplifier noise temperature of 2 k and reducing @xmath51 as well as @xmath52 from 2 to @xmath70 and assuming @xmath71 , the signal - to - noise ratio is doubled . and this does not yet take into account that a nanostructure s resistance typically becomes more sensitive to electrostatic potentials at lower temperatures .    from the above considerations it is clear that having low losses in the matching circuit - no matter which type - is crucial .",
    "potential strategies to reduce losses are the use of low - loss printed circuit boards as well as superconducting air or on - chip inductors@xcite and waveguides .    with this",

[ fig : nwnoise](d ) , where the total noise is plotted as a function of qpc resistance .",

    "shot - noise calibration is a very powerful tool for determining system noise temperatures since the noise power of a nanostructure as a function of dc bias can generally be known very accurately .",
    "therefore , we recorded the noise power with a resolution and video bandwidth of @xmath142 and @xmath141 , respectively , as a function of dc bias and show the result for different qpc conductances in fig .",
    "[ fig : nwshot ] .",
    "the voltage on the varactor diode was @xmath167 , and we subtracted a gain of @xmath168 .",
    "the conductance values chosen were @xmath164 ( a ) , @xmath165 ( b ) , and @xmath166 ( c ) determined by the current at @xmath169 dc bias ( see insets ) and taking into account contact and wiring resistances .",
    "the error bars denote the statistical spread of repeated measurements .",
    "as expected we do not observe any increase in noise for increasing bias when the qpc is completely pinched off ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "for non - zero conductance , though , the bias dependence is much weaker than predicted ( with the same parameters as above ) and for @xmath165 , the noise is even increasing non - monotonically .",
    "similarly , the dc conductances shown in the insets are not constant . while at bias voltages of several mv we are already well in the non - linear regime , the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : shot ] ) should still hold qualitatively .",
    "a reason why we observe too small values for the shot noise is partially the reflection of incoming signals at the cryogenic amplifier s input .",
    "roughly @xmath171 of the shot noise may thus be reflected , which , however , still does not fully explain the low observed noise levels at high bias .",
    "a further explanation may be an overestimation of power transfer @xmath3 between qpc and amplifier .",
    "additionally , localized states in the qpc leading to the atypical conductance curves in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : nwshot ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : nwsample](b ) may strongly influence the shot - noise behavior of the qpc .",
    "in particular , it may be conceivable that shot noise is suppressed even at non - integer conductance values since the transmission through the qpc reaches a plateau well before @xmath129 .",
    "also , our predicted noise temperatures do not exactly match the measured noise at zero bias for high conductance .",
    "this most probably stems from the height of the spurious noise peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : nwnoise](c ) which is found to depend on @xmath9 .    to summarize this experimental section",
    ", we can model the system noise in our setup very well with the exception of the unexpected magnitude and shape of the shot - noise curves .",
    "potentially it would be easier to accurately determine the shot noise with a smaller background noise .    with a similar device as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nwsample](a ) , where the nanowire quantum dot did form , we have obtained a charge sensitivity of approximately @xmath172 , slightly worse than our estimate in sec .  [ sec : noise ] .",
    "the difference can be attributed to signal loss from standing waves and slightly higher noise in the experimental setup - mainly the matching circuit .",
    "in a generally valid derivation for reciprocal two - port networks we have demonstrated a charge - detection experiment s signal - to - noise ratio to increase linearly with power transfer to the load .",
    "thereby we have found it important that losses in the resonant circuit are minimized , unless shot noise is strongly dominating the overall noise .",
    "subsequently we have discussed _ in situ _ tunability in great detail and have visualized the effect of changing the series capacitance of a @xmath0 circuit .",
    "we have also calculated the maximally allowed input voltage and power when limiting the voltage drop over the load , and we have thereby estimated the signal height of the matching network s response to a change in the charge state of the system to amount to several hundred nv .    by assessing the total noise in the system we could determine the expected overall snr and charge sensitivity which we found to be only slightly influenced by the exact circuit - parameter values as long as a fair quality of matching is achieved .",
    "this fact is substantiated by previous experiments@xcite .",
    "the values for the charge sensitivity one can expect in a similar experiment range in a few @xmath173 .    with our present experiments we can confirm tunability and the circuit model as well as the noise levels in the system .",
    "we did observe spurious noise peaks in the spectrum , though , which were depending on the circuit impedance .",
    "we attributed them to the low - noise amplifier since they occurred also for zero applied rf or dc bias .",
    "furthermore the amount of shot noise we detected was significantly lower than expected .",
    "this could partially be explained by the fact that a mismatched amplifier input reflects the noise signal back ( on the other hand , this would require higher circuit noise temperatures ) , and maybe localizations in the qpc - revealing themselves by an unusual gate - voltage behavior and nonlinear @xmath5 characteristics of the qpc - cause the shot noise to be suppressed .",
    "while we still recommend the point of maximal sensitivity to be determined by experiment , our considerations should give an experimentalist dealing with a similar circuit a good feeling for the mutual influences of the circuit elements which is of great importance for optimizing the measurement parameters . also , in our discussions on the power transfer of noise we identified the parameter relevant for improvement in different regimes .",
    "since a good power transfer to the charge detector is quite important , it would be very helpful indeed to be able to determine the source of the losses in such a circuit more closely .",
    "we believe that such a study would require a detailed analysis - comparable to ref .   - of the influence of the exact sample design ( e.g. bonding wires , ohmic contacts , distance traveled in the two - dimensional electron gas ) on the matching network s losses .",
