    "the detector covers roughly 93% of the full solid angle .",
    "the results that follow are derived from a sample of approximately 25 million @xmath1 decays produced at rest in the lab by symmetric @xmath11 collisions in the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "the three @xmath12 states are readily produced in electromagnetic ( e1 ) transitions from the @xmath1 and provide a venue for the study of a wide variety of qcd phenomena .",
    "each of the analyses below rely on full reconstruction of the entire decay chain : @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the initial four - momentum of the @xmath1 is well known from the beam kinematics ; therefore , the experimental resolution can be enhanced by doing a four - contraint kinematic fit of the decay products to the @xmath1 four - momentum hypothesis .",

    "particular interest is in the ratio @xmath17 , which can be calculated simply at first order as @xmath18@xcite .",

    "a clear experimental picture of both the hindered ( @xmath4 ) and allowed ( @xmath34 ) m1 transitions in charmonium is important for understanding a variety of theoretical and experimental issues .",
    "for example , there is interest in using radiative transitions in charmonium to explore photon couplings to quarks in lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "calculating these two rates has been a challenge for quark models@xcite .",
    "both rates are key in normalizing exclusive branching fractions of the @xmath35 ; the focus here is on @xmath36 ) .",
    "as will be discussed in detail below , the @xmath35 lineshape in this decay appears to be non - trivial , and this complicates the measurement of the rate .    to examine the lineshape in detail , thirteen signal - rich @xmath35 decay modes ( and charge conjugates )",
    "are reconstructed : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "like the @xmath2 decays , full event reconstruction and kinematic fitting is employed for these candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig : etac ] ( left ) shows the photon spectrum after it has been sharpened by the kinematic fit .",
    "the background is fit to a ( mc - motivated ) linear function using data in the region @xmath50  mev and @xmath51  mev .",
    "peaking backgrounds below 560  mev are due to @xmath52 , photon cascades from @xmath1 to @xmath22 to @xmath53 states , and @xmath54 , where , for the latter two backgrounds , the two photons merge in the calorimeter .",
    "the signal shows a distinct tail on the high energy side of the photon spectrum .",
    "modification of the line shape for this transition is expected since the natural width is relatively large and the available phase space grows like @xmath55 .",
    "in addition the hindered m1 transition has an additional @xmath56 term in the matrix element@xcite that may enhance the line shape distortion .",
    "these additional line shape modifications , while theoretically motivated , are not constrained well enough to allow a satisfactory fit to the data and lead one to question whether this transition is suitable for extracting the mass and width of the @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ fig : etac ] ( right ) shows the exclusive photon spectrum before kinematic fitting ( red line ) superimposed on the background - subtracted inclusive photon spectrum ( points ) .",
    "the agreement is excellent indicating that the line shape modification is visible also in the raw inclusive photon spectrum .",
    "a variety of techniques are used to extract the yield in the inclusive photon spectrum including using an empirical parametrization of the peak and simply counting events above background . the 10% uncertainty in the number of signal events due to uncertainties in background and signal lineshape",
    "is the dominant systematic uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath57 .",
    "our preliminary result is @xmath58 .     for exclusively reconstructed @xmath35 states and after a full event kinematic fit .",
    "the intrinsic lineshape dominates the experimental resolution , which varies from 4 - 7 mev depending on @xmath35 decay mode .",

    "the singlet @xmath59 state was the last of the expected charmonium states below @xmath60 threshold to be identified@xcite .",
    "there is interest in understanding the hyperfine splittings of the charmonium states as these give insight into the nature of the spin - spin interaction in qcd . in the limit that the confinement term in the qcd potential carries no spin dependence ,",
    "one expects non - zero hyperfine splitting for only @xmath61 states , and the mass of the @xmath3 ( @xmath62 ) should be equal to the spin - averaged @xmath2 mass .",
    "therefore precision measurement of this splitting @xmath63 provides experimental input on the spin dependence of the @xmath64 interaction .",
    "the error on @xmath65 is currently dominated by error on the mass of the @xmath3 ; hence , a more precise measurement is desirable .",
    "the @xmath3 is studied in the isospin - violating process @xmath66 .",
    "two methods are utilized : one that is inclusive of all @xmath35 decay modes and another that reconstructs the @xmath35 in a collection of exclusive hadronic modes , which mostly overlap with those noted in the previous section .",
    "both require a signal @xmath67 from the primary transition @xmath68 be identified from two - photon candidates within three standard deviations of the @xmath67 mass and extract the signal from fits to recoil mass spectrum against this @xmath67 .",
    "the inclusive analysis relies on the identification of a candidate photon for the @xmath52 transition with an energy of @xmath69  mev .",
    "removing this criteria overwhelms the signal with background and allows one to determine the background shape .",
    "figure  [ fig : hc ] ( left ) shows the fitted @xmath67 recoil mass spectrum .",
    "the signal shape is breit - wigner with width fixed to that of the @xmath70 convoluted with a gaussian resolution function of width 2.5  mev@xmath71 .",
    "the mass obtained is @xmath72  mev@xmath71 .",
    "the angular distribution of the photon in the @xmath52 is consistent with that of an @xmath73 transition : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "we obtain @xmath76 from the data .    the exclusive analysis , like other exclusive analyses mentioned above , relies on full reconstruction and kinematic fit of the entire decay chain .",
    "the mass of the @xmath35 candidate was required to be within 30  mev@xmath71 of the nominal @xmath35 mass@xcite .",
    "the @xmath67 recoil spectrum from the set of exclusive candidates is shown on the right of figure  [ fig : hc ] and is fit to a linear background plus a breit - wigner convoluted with a double - gaussian resolution function obtained from mc .",
    "the mass obtained from the fit is @xmath77  mev@xmath71 .",
    "accounting for statistical correlations between the exclusive and inclusive samples , we obtain the preliminary result : @xmath78  mev@xmath71 .",
    "this yields a hyperfine splitting @xmath79  mev/@xmath80 , which is remarkably consistent with zero .",
    "however , richard@xcite cautions against interpreting this result as a lack of spin - spin interactions in the @xmath81 multiplet as @xmath82 should really be compared with the spin - averaged @xmath22 mass as calculated in the potential model , which is several mev higher .     for inclusive ( left ) and exclusive ( right ) @xmath35 selection .",
    "the @xmath3 signal is clearly visible in both cases .",
    "fits to the spectra ( background contributions ) are shown by the solid ( dashed ) lines . ]",
    "the charmonium system provides a rich landscape to study qcd .",
    "we have presented precision measurements for many two - body decays of the @xmath2 states , which have implications in understanding relativistic and radiative corrections in the charmonium system , the role of the color octet mechanism in @xmath83-wave decay , and glueball mixing amongst the light scalar mesons .",
    "the hindered m1 transition , @xmath4 , exhibits a non - trivial lineshape that is necessary to understand theoretically if precision experimental measurements for the partial width for this decay and the mass and width of the @xmath35 are to be obtained .",
    "finally we presented a new precision measurement of the mass of the @xmath3 that is naively consistent with zero hyperfine splitting in the @xmath81 multiplet of charmonium .",
    "analysis of the large sample of @xmath1 collected with the cleo - c detector continues , and more exciting hadronic physics results are expected in the coming year .",
    "i would like to acknowledge the work of my cleo colleagues on these analyses .",
    "i would also like to thank the hadron 07 organizers for providing a wonderful venue to present these results .",
