    "we report results of _ ab initio _ calculations of excitation energies , oscillator strengths , and transition rates in yb - like ions with nuclear charges @xmath2 ranging from 72 to 100 .",
    "the ions considered here , starting from doubly ionized hf  iii , all have @xmath4 ground states .",
    "we do not consider yb  i and lu  ii both of which have a @xmath5 ground state configuration . in recent publications @xcite , the spectra of re  vi , os  vii , and ir  viii were studied and energies levels of the @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 configurations were determined .",
    "the cowan hartree - fock code @xcite with relativistic and correlation options was used in refs .",
    "@xcite to calculate energy levels and to carry out least - squares adjustments of energies .",
    "although we do not consider yb  i and lu  ii here , it should be noted that @xcite recently carried out elaborate calculations of electric - dipole amplitudes in atomic ytterbium .",
    "moreover , @xcite listed energies for 249 levels of yb  i and 40 levels of lu  ii .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use relativistic many - body perturbation theory ( rmbpt ) to determine energies of the 14 even - parity @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 states and the 36 odd - parity @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 states for yb - like ions .",
    "we illustrate our calculation with a detailed study of re  vi , @xmath2= 75 .",
    "our first - order rmbpt calculations include both the coulomb and retarded breit interactions but our second - order calculations are limited to the coulomb interaction only .",
    "reduced matrix elements , line strengths , oscillator strengths , and transition rates are determined for all allowed and forbidden electric - dipole transitions between even - parity ( @xmath10 ) and odd - parity ( @xmath11 ) states .",
    "retarded e1 matrix elements are evaluated in both length and velocity forms .",
    "rmbpt calculations that start from a local potential are gauge independent order - by - order , provided `` derivative terms '' are included in second- and higher - order matrix elements and careful attention is paid to negative - energy states .",
    "the present calculations start from a nonlocal [ xe]@xmath3 dirac - fock ( df ) potential and consequently give gauge - dependent transition matrix elements .",
    "second - order correlation corrections compensate almost exactly for the gauge dependence of the first - order matrix elements and lead to corrected matrix elements that differ by less than 5% in length and velocity forms for all of the ions considered here .",
    "energies from the present calculation agree well with results given in refs .",

    "we obtain good agreement with the experiment for low - lying @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 levels .",
    "we also we obtain reasonable agreement ( 500 -1000 @xmath12 ) for highly - excited @xmath8 levels in re",
    "vi , os  vii , and ir  viii ions .",
    "however , we disagree substantially ( 2000 -10000 @xmath12 ) for @xmath8 levels in pt  ix , au  x , and hg  xi ions . as mentioned in refs .",
    "@xcite , mixing between levels of the @xmath8 configuration and the core excited configurations with a @xmath13 hole could be very important for pt  ix , au  x , and hg  xi ions .",
    "indeed , substantial mixing of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 configurations was found in ref .",
    "@xcite . from this , we conclude that the present values for @xmath8 configurations in pt  ix , au  x , and hg  xi are less reliable ( @xmath16 1% ) than data for re  vi , os  vii , and ir  viii .",

    "[ spl - pd ] .",
    "the fine structures of these levels do not follow the land rules even for small @xmath2 ; the @xmath17 levels are partially inverted , while the @xmath18 and @xmath19 levels show regular ordering of the fine - structure splittings for both low and high @xmath2 .",
    "the unusual splittings are caused by changes from @xmath21 to @xmath22 coupling and by mixing from other triplet and singlet states .",
    "comparisons are made with experimental data from @xcite in fig .",
    "[ spl - pd ] .",
    "excellent agreement ( 0.3%  3% ) is found for the four intervals @xmath23@xmath24 , @xmath25@xmath26 , @xmath27@xmath28 , and @xmath28@xmath29 .",
    "the agreement decreases for the @xmath30@xmath23 and @xmath26@xmath31 intervals , from 10% for re@xmath32 to 2% for hg@xmath33 .",
    "experimental energies for other ions would be very helpful in confirming the @xmath2 dependence shown in fig .",

    "[ fig - line]a and fig .",
    "[ fig - line]b , we can see that the @xmath2 dependence is the same for both cases except for the small region @xmath2 = 8088 .",

    "[ dip - lv ] .",
    "similar singularities appeared for other uncoupled matrix elements between even - parity @xmath36=2 states and odd - parity @xmath36=3 states .",
    "consequently , those singularities also appear in the coupled matrix elements and the line strengths shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - line ] .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence is more complicated for transitions between even - parity states with @xmath36=1 and odd - parity states with @xmath36=0 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - osc ] , where we give oscillator strengths for four transitions calculated ( a ) by rmbpt and ( b ) in first - order .",
    "the oscillator strength curves are not smooth functions of @xmath2 , even in first - order .",
    "the singularities shown in the four curves of fig .",
    "[ fig - osc]b arise from the strong mixing between three states of the odd - parity complex with @xmath36=0 .",

    "in summary , a systematic second - order rmbpt study of the energies of the @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 states of yb - like ions has been presented .",
    "these calculations agree with existing experimental energy data for intermediate @xmath2=75 to 80 at the level of 500 - 1000  @xmath12 for low - lying @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 levels .",

    "the dipole matrix elements include retardation and correlation corrections from coulomb and breit interactions .",
    "both length and velocity forms of the matrix elements are evaluated , and @xmath40  % differences , caused by the non - locality of the starting df potential , are found between the two forms .",
    "we believe that our results will be useful in analyzing existing experimental data and planning new experiments .",
    "there remains a paucity of experimental data for many of the higher ionized members of this sequence , both for term energies and for transition probabilities and lifetimes .",
    "additionally , matrix elements from the present calculations will provide basic theoretical input for calculations of reduced matrix elements , oscillator strengths , and transition rates in three - electron lu - like ions .",
