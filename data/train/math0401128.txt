    "as reported in goodwin @xcite , the trapezoidal rule is a very efficient method of computation of integrals @xmath123 for rapidly decaying integrands @xmath124 ; in particular , it is know that the error decays as @xmath125 for integrals of the type @xmath126 with @xmath127 analytic in @xmath128 . after appropriate changes of variable , similar arguments",
    "follow for integrals over finite intervals with a smooth integrand @xcite .",
    "the semi - infinite integrals in this section are appropriate for their computation by using the trapezoidal rule , because they decay as a double exponential as @xmath129 . on the other hand ,",
    "the integrals over finite intervals show abrupt variations as @xmath88 , particularly in the oscillatory case , but under an adequate change of variables they can be also computed efficiently by means of the trapezoidal rule . for finite integrals , we consider a change of variable in order to map the finite interval @xmath130 $ ] into @xmath131 and a successive change to improve the convergence of the trapezoidal rule @xcite ; namely , we consider the following transformation :    @xmath132    and the integral is discretized by means of the trapezoidal rule with equal mesh size : @xmath133    where the error @xmath134 is expected to decay very fast as the mesh size is decreased because the integrand is analytic and its decay is doubly exponential .",
    "we use a trapezoidal rule which halves the mesh size until the prescribed precision is reached ; the same rule controls that the truncation of the infinite series ( [ dis ] ) gives an error well below the accuracy claim .    regarding the semi - infinite integrals , we use a change of variable to transform the integration interval @xmath135 to @xmath136 .",
    "we consider the following change of variables to perform this map . @xmath137",
    "the additional change @xmath138 improves the convergence of the trapezoidal rule .",
    "it is observed that , typically , no more than @xmath139 iterations of the trapezoidal rule are needed , which means that the integrands are evaluated at @xmath140 points in the worst cases .",
    "this is the typical number of iterations for the evaluation of @xmath141 by means of a recursive trapezoidal rule when double precision accuracy is demanded .",
    "this fact confirms that the above mentioned changes of variable are adequate for the computation of the integrals for the modified bessel functions .      as discussed in @xcite",

    "239 - 240 ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a full description of this scheme .",
    "as numerical experiments show , this method is competitive in speed with asymptotic expansions for large @xmath3 ( section [ asyx ] ) and the range of application is larger .",
    "therefore , the continued fraction method substitutes the use of asymptotic expansions for large @xmath3 .",
    "as described in previous sections , the integral representations which were developed indicate that the dominant behaviour for the functions when the parameters are large is of exponential type .",
    "this means that the computations can only be carried for not too large values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in order to avoid overflows / underflows in the computation .",

    "this will approximately limit @xmath2 to @xmath150 . on the other hand , for the monotonic region ( @xmath71 ) the integral representations show that the dominant exponential behaviour is @xmath151 , @xmath152 where @xmath153 , @xmath154 ( @xmath155 $ ] ) , and similarly for the derivatives .",
    "this means that , in order to avoid overflows / underflows , the range of computation must be restricted to : @xmath156      given that all our expressions have the dominant exponential contributions factored out , exponentially scaled functions can be defined which are computable in wider ranges .",
    "namely , we define : @xmath158 and @xmath159      note that , as in the rest of the article , we are considering positive @xmath2 because @xmath0 and @xmath1 are even functions of @xmath2 .",
