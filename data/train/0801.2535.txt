    "for the last decade , lattice gauge theory techniques have made dramatic progress in increasing our understanding of the non - perturbative regime of qcd @xcite . despite considerable advances , there are still sources of systematic error in lattice data , for example , the finite extent of the lattice and the unphysically large quark masses . fortunately low - energy hadron properties are dominated by virtual pion interactions and the systematic treatment of such interactions using chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt ) allows one to parametrize the lattice volume and quark mass dependence of certain observables .",
    "there has been considerable activity to understand theoretically the quark mass and lattice volume dependence of hadronic observables .",
    "further extentions of chiral perturbation theory have been developed to account for quenching and partially quenching @xcite , and discretization errors @xcite .",
    "an example is the nucleon axial charge , @xmath2 .",
    "recent lattice studies have made impressive strides toward determining @xmath2 @xcite . in tandem ,",
    "recent @xmath1pt analyses of the chiral , continuum and volume extrapolations are poised to connect the data to the physical point .",
    "we are beginning to enter a stage in which the combination of lattice qcd data and @xmath1pt will enable the study the hadronic properties from the first principles .",
    "a serious issue , however , confronts this program when extended to hyperon observables .",
    "various @xmath0 predictions for hyperon properties compare poorly to experiment in contrast to the many successful @xmath3 predictions for the nucleon .",
    "while @xmath1pt can be used to systematically incorporate effects from the strange quark mass , the systematic expansion in the baryon sector has terms that scale ( in the worst case ) as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass of the @xmath6-meson and @xmath7 is the average hyperon mass .",
    "a well known conflict between @xmath1pt analyses and experimental data exist for hyperon decays .",
    "for example , the non - leptonic weak decays , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , have been extensively investigated experimentally .",
    "in particular the @xmath10- and @xmath11-wave contributions to these weak decays are determined to high precision . although efforts in the framework of @xmath1pt have been devoted to understand these non - leptonic decays theoretically , long - standing disagreement between these theoretical analyses and experimental data remain @xcite .",
    "one is thus led to question the efficacy of three - flavor @xmath1pt in the baryon sector . without this systematic model - independent expansion ,",
    "lattice qcd data for hyperon properties can not be reliably extrapolated to the physical values of the quark masses . additionally volume and continuum extrapolations using three - flavor  can not be trusted .",
    "indeed the first lattice calculation of hyperon axial charges , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite , shows little evidence for the one - loop predictions from ( partially quenched ) @xmath1pt @xcite .",
    "the lattice , however , can provide a diagnostic tool to investigate the condition of three - flavor @xmath1pt .",
    "a complete study of baryon axial charges is the natural starting point .",
    "these couplings enter in the loop graphs that determine the long - range chiral corrections to all baryon observables .",
    "input of these measured parameters into @xmath1pt expressions allows one to numerically assess the behavior of the long - range contributions in the chiral expansion .",
    "this information can then be used to address the convergence of the chiral expansion .",
    "perhaps the expansion is converging to the wrong answer , or perhaps the expansion is not converging at all .",
    "if it is the latter case , one can use the lattice to investigate the cause .",
    "perhaps certain observables are corrupted by large values of local contributions that can be isolated and determined from lattice data , or perhaps nearby resonances are leading to large enhancements .    in this work ,",
    "we provide a follow - up to @xcite by determining the full set of hyperon matrix elements of flavor changing axial currents .",
    "we work to next - to - leading order in partially quenched heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory to address both the chiral behavior and momentum - transfer dependence of the axial form factors . due to meson pole contributions",
    ", the pseudoscalar form factor provides an observable well - suited for the investigation of chiral physics in three - flavor theories . despite the accumulation of a large number ( eight ) of undetermined low - energy constants",
