    "nacre is a composite material with solid layers ( aragonite ) separated by thin slices of soft organic matter ( proteins ) ( fig .",
    "it has a spectacular toughness where a fracture propagates normal to the layers @xcite .",
    "this toughness can be explained from the absence of stress concentration in this structure @xcite . in the present note ,",
    "we consider a different problem , where the fracture plane is parallel to the layers .",
    "the fracture properties have some similarity with those of a smectic liquid crystal , which have been discussed under the name of lenticular fracture @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to consider the dynamics , when the soft layers behave like a viscoelastic fluid .",
    "but we shall start with a reminder of the statics , using a simple scaling argument .",
    ", thickness @xmath0 ) are glued together by soft layers ( modulus @xmath1 , thickness @xmath2 ) .",
    "cracks in the @xmath3 plane and the @xmath4 plane are called a perpendicular and parallel fractures , respectively ( the @xmath5-axis is perpendicular to this page ) . ]",
    "the crucial feature is that , for a fracture cavity of size @xmath6 along the layers , the elastically distorted zone has a size @xmath7 ( perpendicular to the layers ) which does not scale like @xmath6 , but rather like@xmath8 _ for small cracks _ ( @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 is a characteristic length@xmath11 here @xmath12 is a bending modulus and @xmath13 is an elastic modulus associated with soft layers .",
    "it is emphasized that _ eq . ( [ y - x2 ] ) always holds at the scaling level_. ( for larger cracks ( @xmath14 ) the relation ( [ y - x2 ] ) turns back to @xmath15 ; this regime will be discussed elsewhere @xcite ) .    for stratified materials ,",
    "the following relation has been shown @xcite:@xmath16 where@xmath17 in the small @xmath18 limit ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] for notations ) . in the case of nacre",
    ", the small crack condition @xmath9 is rather severe ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus , the following considerations might be more practical for some artificially synthesized layered composites where the soft part is a _ weak gel _ , @xmath20 is very small and @xmath21 .    the small crack condition @xmath9 makes the situation different from smectic liquid crystals where we have @xmath22 because @xmath10 corresponds to an atomic scale ( @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ y - x2 ] ) ) @xcite . in the present case , for @xmath24",
    ", we have @xmath25 ; _ the anisotropic strain field is distributed widely in the _ @xmath26 _ direction compared with in the _ @xmath27 _ direction _",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] below ) .    the potential energy ( per unit length in the @xmath5-direction ) of the crack is@xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the displacement in the @xmath27-direction , @xmath30 the pulling stress ( along the @xmath27 axis ) and @xmath31 the fracture energy ( energy required to create a new unit area ) .",
    "( it has been shown that the dominant component in strain and stress tensors are indeed the @xmath27 components ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ) @xcite ) .",
    "note here the first elastic term can be equally expressed as @xmath32 due to eq .",
    "( [ y - x2 ] ) ; this term actually results from a local balance between these two elastic contributions and eq .",
    "( [ y - x2 ] ) originates from this balance condition @xcite . minimizing @xmath33 with respect to @xmath34",
    "then , @xmath35 has a maximum defining the onset of fracture . at this critical of fracture we have@xmath36 where the last equation announces that _ the product _ @xmath37 _ gives the fracture energy_. these fractures are very different from conventional parabolic fractures in linear elastic fracture mechanics @xcite : @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in a more precise analysis , we have obtained forms for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xcite which are consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ u - s ] ) and ( [ y - x2 ] ) .",
    "( [ y - x2 ] ) states that , _ at the scaling level , a point away from the tip by a distance _ @xmath6 _ along the _ @xmath26 _ axis has the same order of strain ( or stress ) with that by a distance _ @xmath7 _ along the _ @xmath27 _ axis , when _ @xmath42 ; the situation can be _ conceptually represented _ as in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .    , recovers the usual isotropic behavior .",
    "( fracture studied in this paper is limited : @xmath43 ) . ]",
    "we now proceed to the dynamics via a complex modulus of the form @xcite@xmath44 where the ratio @xmath45 is assumed to be large as it is in a weakly cross - linked system .",
    "here , @xmath20 is related to a small modulus associated with weak cross - links while @xmath46 to a large modulus originating from entanglements .",
    "( [ visc ] ) is a result of taking viscoelastic effects in soft layers through a complex modulus of the same form ( but with @xmath20 and @xmath46 replaced by @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) @xcite .",
    "we consider a parallel crack propagating with a constant speed @xmath49 . when @xmath49 is smaller than a sound velocity ( @xmath50 ) , the equation of motion of the density @xmath51 and the local velocity @xmath52 at the scaling level , @xmath53 , reduces to a static equation : @xmath54 .",
    "this is even true in our linear rheological model .",
    "in addition , the stress components must also satisfy a compatibility equations , which directly result from the definitions of strain fields as derivatives of deformation fields .",
    "but these geometric conditions , again , have the same scaling structures for our linear rheological model .",
    "thus , _ the scaling relation for the stress in eq .",
    "( [ u - s ] ) , _",
    "_ , remains unchanged even in our viscoelastic model__. these observations will be more precisely addressed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "another important observation here is the scaling identification of a distance @xmath6 _ along the _ @xmath26 _ axis _ from the tip and the frequency @xmath56 via the speed @xmath49 : @xmath57 small distances correspond to high frequencies while long distances to low frequencies  the farther away from the tip , the more time for relaxation .",
    "in addition , from eq .",
    "( [ y - x2 ] ) , the same magnitude of strain with the point specified by the above @xmath6 is developed at a point separated from the tip by a distance @xmath58 along the @xmath27 axis ; these points have the same time ( @xmath59 ) to relax .",
    "thus , a distance @xmath7 from the tip sees the same frequency frequency @xmath60but a slower propagating speed @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) . in other words",
    ", we can imagine that fig .",
    "[ f2 ] correspond to a sequential propagation ( from the center to outwards ) .",
    "we also note that , seen from a new coordinate @xmath63 , the system returns to an isotropic system .",
    "for example , eqs .",
    "( [ u - s ] ) are changed into the conventional parabolic form : @xmath64 and @xmath65 etc .    our viscoelastic model in eq .",
    "( [ visc ] ) has three regimes depending on frequencies : ( i ) at small frequencies ( @xmath66 ) , it is like a soft solid with a small modulus @xmath67 , ( ii ) at intermediate frequencies ( @xmath68 ) , it is like a liquid with viscosity @xmath69 , and ( iii ) at high frequencies ( @xmath70 ) , it is like a solid with a large modulus @xmath71 . due to the correspondence between a distance and a frequency in eq .",
    "( [ rv ] ) , a fracture can be thus spatially divided into three regions ( fig .",

    "the smallest region defined by @xmath73 comes out for a continuum theory .",
    "note that for a crack smaller than in this figure ( @xmath74 ) only the regions i and ii are developed while for an even smaller crack ( @xmath75 ) only the region i is developed ; this figure corresponds to a fully developed crack ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "note also that the degree of anisotropy of the boundaries separating regions are subject to the ratio of @xmath77 or @xmath78 to the length @xmath10 ; the smaller the ratio , the more anisotropic . ]",
    "we consider a small crack size @xmath79 with @xmath80 @xmath81 ( larger crack sizes ( @xmath82 ) will be discussed elsewhere @xcite ) ; then , all the three regions ( i)-(iii ) are fully developed .",
    "the soft - solid region ( i ) corresponds to low frequencies , and thus , to the static limit ; in this region ( @xmath83 ) , eqs .",
    "( [ u - s ] ) hold . in the liquid zone ( ii ) , the stress field scales as @xmath84 and at the same time it should scale as @xmath85 even in this liquid region as stated above .",
    "thus , the strain should scale as @xmath86 and the product as @xmath87 .",
    "the coefficients can be determined by the matching at @xmath88 ( the boundary between i and ii ) : @xmath89 in the hard - solid region of @xmath46 , we find @xmath90 and @xmath91 as in eqs .",
    "( [ u - s ] ) but with @xmath92 ( via the same manner as in deriving eqs .",

    "@xmath31 _ for a fully developed crack is enhanced from _",
    "@xmath93 _ associated with local precesses near the tip_. note here that this expression for @xmath31 is valid for @xmath96 in our continuum theory .",
    "the crack shape resulting from this analysis is summarized as follows:@xmath97{ll}% x & \\text { for } \\lambda v\\tau < x\\\\ x^{2 } & \\text { for } v\\tau",
    "< x<\\lambda v\\tau\\\\ x & \\text { for } x < v\\tau \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] it is just like a trumpet with a lenticular edge ( fig .",

    "[ f4 ] ) .",
    "we complete our arguments by considering smaller fractures .",
    "when @xmath74 , only the hard - solid and liquid region are present ; the soft solid has yet to develop .",
    "in this situation , the fracture energy is given by eq .",
    "( [ sul ] ) at @xmath98 : @xmath99 ; the toughness decreases with velocity . when @xmath100 , only the hard - solid region is developed and the fracture energy is given by @xmath93 .",
