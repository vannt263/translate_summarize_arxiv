    "molecular junctions , where a single molecule is bound to two electrodes , provide interesting systems to study basic mechanisms of non - equilibrium charge transport at the nanoscale and are promising candidates for the development of nanoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "the possibility of using single molecules as electronic components in electronic circuits has motivated intensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite research on the conductance properties of these systems and revealed a multitude of interesting transport phenomena .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that a molecular junction may be used as a nano switch if the molecule bridge has two ( or more ) stable states with different conductance , which can be reversibly transformed into each other @xcite .    in recent years , several optical and non - optical mechanisms for molecular switches in junctions",
    "have been investigated @xcite .",
    "many of the optical mechanisms rely on conformational changes of the molecule triggered by light absorption ( such as light induced _ cis_-_trans _ isomerization processes @xcite ) to facilitate reversible switching between different conductance states .",
    "non - optical mechanisms investigated include electrochemical switching , where a reversible redox pair is generated using voltage pulses @xcite or mechanical switching , where external mechanical forces are applied to produce the reversible change between states with different conductance @xcite .    in recent theoretical work by some of the authors",
    "@xcite , it was shown that it is possible to use a photoinduced excited state hydrogen transfer reaction between the keto and enol tautomers of a molecule to realize a molecular switch .",
    "as was demonstrated for an example of a polyene functionalized with keto and amino groups , this switching mechanism relies on the fact that keto and enol tautomeric forms often exhibit different conjugation properties , which are associated with localized or delocalized charge distributions on the molecular bridge , and thus realize different conductance states .    in this contribution",
    ", we build on these results and propose a new non - optical switching mechanism based on a ground state proton transfer reaction triggered by an external electrostatic field . as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism , we study the ground state proton transfer reaction between oligomeric forms of p2hp and p2py .",
    "specifically , we investigate the proton transfer reaction between the enol tris[2,5-(4-hydroxypyridine ) ] ( t2hp ) and the corresponding keto form tris\\{2,5-[4(1h)-pyridone ] } ( t2py ) ( for binding to the au leads , the oligomers have been appropriately functionalized at their ends as indicated in fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we show that both tautomers exhibit different current - voltage characteristics providing the `` on '' and `` off '' states of a molecular switch and provide a proof of principle that both forms can be reversibly interconverted using an external electrostatic field .",
    "keto tris\\{2,5-[4(1h)-pyridone ] } ( t2py , top ) and enol tris[2,5-(4-hydroxypyridine ) ] ( t2hp , bottom ) tautomers of the molecular switch investigated in this work .",
    "both forms have been functionalized for binding to the au leads with 3,4-dimercapto-(1h)-pyridine and 3,4-dimercaptobenzenone ( keto form , top ) and 3,4-dimercaptopyridine and 3,4-dimercaptophenol ( enol form , bottom).,scaledwidth=55.0% ]",
    "to investigate the transport properties of the molecular junctions , we have used a methodology which combines electronic structure calculations employing density functional theory ( dft ) and landauer transport theory .",
    "the method has been described in detail previously @xcite . here",
    ", we only provide the main aspects and some details specific to the current application .    in the electronic structure calculations",
    ", we have modelled the molecular junction using the bridge molecule and two clusters containing three layers of au atoms ( comprising a total of 88 au atoms ) .",
    "the equilibrium structures of the keto and enol tautomers have been optimized using dft methods .",
    "specifically , as described elsewhere @xcite , we have carried out a partial geometry optimization of a cluster consisting of the respective tautomer and the first layer of the au atoms of each lead in order to determine realistic tautomer - lead binding geometries .",
    "subsequently , two extra layers of au atoms per lead were added to the optimized structures to obtain the models investigated in this work ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . following previous work @xcite",
    ", all calculations were carried out using the b3lyp hybrid correlation - exchange functional together with a sv(p ) basis set @xcite ( au atoms have been described using the ecp-60-mwb pseudopotential @xcite ) as implemented in turbomole @xcite . to describe the effect of infinite leads we have added the surface self - energy of a au(111 ) surface to the atomic orbital energies of the au atoms of the outer layer of both leads @xcite .",
    "the current for a given voltage was obtained from the landauer formula @xcite @xmath0de\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the fermi distributions of the left and right lead , respectively @xcite , and @xmath3 is the transmission function , which depends on the applied bias voltage .",
    "@xmath3 contains the information about the junction and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath4\\ ] ] here , @xmath5 denotes the molecular green s function and the functions @xmath6 describe broadening of molecular states due to coupling with the metallic leads . the methodology to obtain these functions",
    "is described in ref .",
    "fig .  [ fig3 ] shows the current - voltage characteristics calculated for t2hp and t2py ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the results reveal very different transport properties of the two tautomers .",
    "while the keto form exhibits a rather low current , the enol form facilitates a significantly larger current for bias voltages @xmath7 v. thus , for a given bias voltage , the two tautomers realize different conductance states of the molecular junction and can be associated with `` on '' ( enol ) and `` off '' ( keto ) states of a molecular nano switch .    to obtain insight into the mechanism underlying the very different conductance properties of the two tautomers , we have analyzed their transmission functions @xmath3 ( see eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) , depicted for zero bias voltage in fig .",
    "the current is determined by the values of the transmission function close to the fermi energy .",
    "both tautomers exhibit low values of transmission in the immediate vicinity of the fermi energy resulting in low current for bias voltages @xmath8 v. significant values of transmission are observed for energies @xmath9 ev @xmath10 ev , below the fermi energy .",
    "the structures of the transmission function in this energy range reveal a pronounced difference between the two tautomers .",
    "in particular , the transmission peaks of the enol form are significantly broader , indicating a stronger coupling of the molecular bridge to the leads and , thus , resulting in the larger current observed for bias voltages @xmath7 v ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "current - voltage characteristics of the two tautomeric forms of the molecular junction depicted in fig .",
    "the black and the red lines depict the current of the enol and keto tautomers , respectively.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    transmission as a function of electron energy ( relative to the fermi level ) at zero bias voltage .",
    "the black and red lines correspond to the enol and keto forms , respectively .",
    "the inset depicts the region close to the fermi level.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    this finding is corroborated by an analysis of the molecular orbitals associated to the most relevant structures in the transmission function , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in the case of the enol form",
    ", the peak at @xmath11 ev is associated to the @xmath12-like orbitals ( a ) and ( b ) that extend over the molecule . on the other hand , the orbital ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . which is responsible for the peak at @xmath13 ev in the keto tautomer , is more localized and has most of its density in the center of the molecule .",
    "the difference in the extension of the orbitals of the enol and keto forms can be explained in terms of the degree of conjugation present in both systems . whereas the enol form is mainly characterized by a delocalized valence bond structure , the contribution of this class of valence bond structures to the keto tautomer",
    "can be expected to be less important .",
    "the results presented above suggest that t2ph and t2py may be used as the `` on '' and `` off '' states in a molecular nano switch . to achieve this functionality , a mechanism for a reversible transformation between the two tautomers , i.e. a proton transfer ,",
    "is required . for this purpose ,",
    "the different charge distributions of the two tautomers may be exploited .",
    "as is well known , proton transfer reactions may be triggered by an external electrical field @xcite . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we have studied the relative stability of both tautomers in the presence of a constant external electrostatic field oriented in a direction along the axis of the junction ( see fig . [ fig6 ] ) . as a measure of the relative stability of the keto and enol forms , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] depicts the difference of their ground state energies as a function of the strength of the applied external field .",
    "the results show that without external field , the most stable tautomer is the enol form .",
    "this is due to the stabilization obtained by aromaticity and conjugation .",
    "application of an external electric field modifies the situation . upon a gradual increase in the strength of the field the energy difference between the enol and the keto forms decreases and for values larger than @xmath14 @xmath15 an inversion of the relative stabilities of the tautomers",
    "can be obtained .",
    "this provides a proof of principle that a reversible interconversion between the t2hp and t2py using an external electrostatic field is possible . in a more general context",
    ", the possibility to control the conductance by an external electrostatic field , may also be used as a mechanism for a single molecule transistor .",
    "+   +    we finally mention some possible extensions of the present study .",
    "first , for the specific system investigated , the largest difference in current occurs only for larger voltages .",
    "this is due to the fact that the most relevant molecular orbitals have energies further away from the fermi energy .",
    "an optimization of the functionality can thus be achieved by using chemical substitutions that shift the energies closer to the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "second , in the present study we have focused on the conductance properties of the two tautomers at fixed nuclear geometry .",
    "an investigation of the mechanism of switching requires the modelling of the potential energy surfaces along the reaction coordinates and the nuclear dynamics under bias .",
    "third , the external electrostatic field may also influence the conductance , e.g. by shifting the energy levels of the molecular bridge .",
    "thus a more complete description has to include the electric fields of the junction and the external electric field in the transport calculations .",
    "this will be the subject of future work .",
    "energy difference between t2py and t2hp for different values of the applied external electrostatic field .",
    "the inset shows the direction of the field.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "we have explored the possibility to use a proton transfer reaction as a mechanism for switching a molecular junction between different conductance states . as a specific example",
    ", we have analyzed the conductance properties of t2hp and t2py enol - keto tautomers .",
    "we have shown that both forms exhibit very different electrical currents , which allows their use as the `` on '' and `` off '' states of a molecular nano switch .",
    "the origin of this difference has been explained in terms of the different electronic structures characterizing both tautomers .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that switching between the two conductance state may be achieved by an external electrostatic field which triggers a proton transfer reaction that interconverts the two tautomers reversibly .",
    "the results of this theoretical study suggest that keto - enol tautomers can be used as building blocks of a nanoscale molecular switch or , more generally , a molecular transistor .",
