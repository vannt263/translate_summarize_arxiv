    "it is not an easy problem to find exact black hole solutions with a clear physical interpretation in gravity theories , but it is not less difficult to prove or discard their uniqueness and stability . in four dimensions ,",
    "years of research ended with the conclusion that the kerr black hole solution is stable and satisfies a uniqueness theorem .",
    "the higher dimensional arena , both in the vacuum einstein theory and in its extension to include the supergravity fields of low energy string theory , has a broaden variety of black hole solutions .",
    "for example , five - dimensional ( 5d ) einstein theory allows not only the existence of black holes with topology @xmath2  the tangherlini black hole @xcite and the myers - perry black hole @xcite  but also the emparan - reall black ring with topology @xmath3 @xcite , and extended objects known as black strings @xcite .",
    "this higher variety of solutions suggests that the uniqueness theorem might not be valid in higher dimensions .",
    "the uniqueness of the 5d myers - perry solution for black holes with topology @xmath2 , and with two commuting spacelike killing vectors and a stationary timelike killing vector has been proven @xcite . however , when other topologies and killing symmetries are considered , the uniqueness theorem is violated as the discovery of the black ring explicitly proves . in five dimensions ,",
    "a black hole can rotate along two distinct planes .",
    "the rotating black ring of @xcite has angular momentum only along @xmath0 .",
    "setting one of the angular momenta equal to zero in the myers - perry black hole , there is an upper bound for the ratio between the angular momentum @xmath4 and the mass @xmath5 of the black hole , @xmath6 , while for the black ring there is a lower bound in the above ratio , @xmath7 , i.e. , there is a minimum rotation that is required in order to prevent the black ring from collapsing .",
    "now , what is quite remarkable is that for @xmath8 there are myers - perry black holes and emparan - reall black rings with the same values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , for the same values of the conserved charges , there are actually two branches of black rings differing on the size of their radius .",
    "the uniqueness in higher dimensions is further violated when extra conserved charges and dipole charges are included @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", it will be important to note that one of the parameters that characterizes the emparan - reall black ring is its radius , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "when this radius goes to zero the black ring reduces to the myers - perry black hole , while in the infinite - radius limit it yields a boosted black string .",
    "recently , a vacuum black ring solution with angular momentum along @xmath1 ( but no rotation along @xmath0 ) was found by mishima and iguchi @xcite .",
    "this solution was rediscovered and properly interpreted by figueras @xcite . since",
    "this solution does not rotate along @xmath0 , it is balanced by the pressure of a conical disk .",
    "when its radius goes to zero the black ring reduces to the myers - perry black hole , while in the infinite - radius limit it yields a kerr black string @xcite .",
    "the most general element of the vacuum black ring family of solutions  hereafter dubbed doubly spinning black ring  with rotation both along @xmath0 and @xmath1 is still not yet known .",
    "however , we know that it will reduce to @xcite or @xcite when one of the rotations vanishes .",
    "moreover , the zero - radius limit of this doubly spinning black ring will be a 5d myers - perry black hole with two angular momenta , and the infinite - radius limit will yield a boosted kerr black string .",
    "black hole solutions in higher dimensions bring also new challenges to the stability issue .",
    "some progress is being slowly achieved .",
    "the stability of tangherlini black holes is established @xcite . however , in the higher dimensional arena it was been progressively realized that instability is more the rule rather than the exception .",
    "there are indeed several instabilities that afflict higher dimensional objects , and some of them can be grouped in the following classes :    \\a ) the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite : this gravitational instability is active in extended black objects like black strings , black branes , and at least large radius black rings @xcite .",
    "the unstable modes are long wavelength modes along the string , so this instability can be eliminated by reducing the radius of the compactification along the string . for a fixed radius ,",
    "it is also suppressed by boosting the solution along the string direction @xcite .",
    "\\b ) superradiant instability : superradiant scattering , where an incident wave packet can be reflected with a stronger amplitude , can lead to an instability if , e.g. , we have a reflecting wall surrounding the black hole that scatters the returning wave back toward the horizon . in such a situation , the wave will bounce back and forth , between the mirror and the black hole , amplifying itself each time .",
    "the total extracted energy grows exponentially until finally the radiation pressure destroys the mirror .",
    "this is press and teukolsky s black hole bomb , first proposed in @xcite and studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "this instability can arise with a natural ` mirror ' in a variety of situations : a massive scalar field in a kerr background creates a potential that can cause flux to scatter back toward the horizon @xcite ; infinity in asymptotically ads spaces also provides a natural wall that leads , for certain conditions , to an instability @xcite ; a wave propagating around spinning black strings may similarly find itself trapped , because the kaluza - klein momentum along the string can provide a potential barrier at infinity @xcite .",
    "the unstable modes can be scalar , electromagnetic or gravitational . in general , but with exceptions",
    ", this instability can be present for arbitrary values of angular momentum of the geometry .",
    "\\c ) gyration instability : in the context of d1-d5-p black strings , it was found that a spinning black string whose angular momentum exceeds a certain critical value , decays into a gyrating black string in which part of the original angular momentum is carried by gyrations of the string @xcite .",
    "the gyrating string has a helical profile traveling along the string with the velocity of light .",
    "this instability is active for long strings with large angular momentum .",
    "\\d ) ultra - spin instability : in six or higher spacetime dimensions , there is no upper bound for the rotation of the myers - perry black hole @xcite .",
    "however , it was argued @xcite that a gregory - laflamme - like instability will arise to dynamically enforce a kerr - like bound in these cases .",
    "while this analysis does not directly apply in five dimensions , entropy arguments suggest an analogous instability still exists and will lead to the formation of a black ring if the angular momentum is too large @xcite .",
    "\\e ) ergoregion instability : geometries that have an ergoregion but are horizon - free develop this kind of instability @xcite .",
    "it occurs in rotating stars with an ergoregion @xcite , as well as in smooth non - supersymmetric d1-d5-p geometries @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we point out that 5d doubly spinning back rings can be expected to suffer from the superradiant instability described in item b ) , and we find its properties .",
    "this instability is triggered by two factors that occur simultaneously .",
    "on one hand , the kk momentum of the waves along the ring works effectively as a massive term that provides a potential barrier at infinity .",
    "this potential barrier allows the appearance of a potential well where bound states get trapped . on the other hand",
    ", the bound state modes can suffer superradiant amplification in the ergoregion .",
    "the unstable modes are then waves that bounce back and forth between the ergoregion and the potential barrier and that are amplified in each scattering . this kind of instability , where the bound states are induced by the kk momentum , has first suggested by marolf and palmer @xcite , and explicitly studied by cardoso , lemos and yoshida @xcite .",
    "this is the same instability , but with a different source for the bound states , as the one studied in @xcite .    to fully study analytically this instability in the black ring geometry",
    "we would have to separate the wave equation in this background .",
    "however , it is not possible to do this separation even in the scalar case and even in the black ring with rotation only along @xmath0 .",
    "this is explicitly shown in @xcite , where the term that impedes this wave separation is identified .",
    "this obstacle is closely connected with the fact that the hamiltonian - jacobi equation for the geodesics is not also separable @xcite , and ultimately with the fact that the solution does not have a killing tensor @xcite .",
    "an investigation of waves in this geometry will have to be done using full 3d numerical simulations . given this handicap ( and",
    "the fact that the finite radius doubly spinning black ring metric is still not yet known ) , we do what can be done analytically : we consider the large radius limit of the doubly spinning black ring  which yields a boosted kerr black string  and we verify that this instability is active in this background .",
    "we then compactify the string direction to find conclusions about the instability in finite radius black rings .",
    "whenever one has an instability , we naturally ask what is its endpoint .",
    "usually , it is remarkably difficult to give a definite answer to this question .",
    "for example , it still remains an open issue the ultimate fate of the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite , of the gyration instability @xcite , and of the ergoregion instability @xcite .",
    "however , the superradiant instabilities are special , in the sense that we usually can make strong statements about their endpoint .",
    "this follows from the fact that the growth of this type of instability is fed by the rotational energy of the background geometry which decreases during the process . in our case",
    ", we will conclude that the boosted kerr black string will release all its angular momentum , and will settle down into a non - rotating boosted black string .",
    "however , as a consequence of the kk momentum quantization that occurs when we compactify a black string , we will argue that finite radius black rings will not loose all their angular momentum along @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in practice this means that the superradiant instability provides a dynamical mechanism that imposes an upper bound for the rotation of the black rings along @xmath1 .",
    "note that due the the presence of other instabilities on the system , like , e.g. , the gregory - laflamme one , we expect that a classical evolution of the black ring will proceed with the contribution of all the instabilities that afflict the system .",
    "it is not clear yet what is the exact endstate of this evolution .",
    "the plan of the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec : geometries]-[sec : quantitative ] it is argued that 5d doubly spinning black rings are expected to be unstable .",
    "in section [ sec : geometries ] we review the relevant black ring geometries and their large radius limit . in section [ sec : weq black string ]",
    "we separate the klein - gordon equation in the infinite radius black ring background , and we discuss the relevant ingredients and properties of the instability . the quantitative features of the instability , namely its frequency spectrum and its timescale are computed in section [ sec : quantitative ] , using the matched asymptotic method .",
    "the stability analysis of the higher dimensional boosted myers - perry black string is carried in section [ sec : hi dim ] , where it is shown that they are stable against the superradiant mechanism .",
    "the eventual implications of this result to the stability of higher dimensional rings is then discussed .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] we discuss the results , with an emphasis given to the issue of the instability endpoint .",
    "in particular , we argue that the instability discussed in this paper provides a mechanism that effectively bounds the rotation of doubly spinning black rings .",
    "we estimate the upper bound , both on the rotation along @xmath0 and @xmath1 , using the recent black ring model of @xcite , with a minor extension to accommodate an extra small angular momentum .",
    "the first element of the family of 5d black rings has found by emparan and reall @xcite and is described by ( here we write the metric in the form displayed in @xcite after using the factorization of @xcite ) @xmath11 } , \\label{metric s1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 the coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 vary within the ranges , @xmath15 to avoid conical singularities the period of the angular coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 must be @xmath18 and the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 must satisfy the relation @xmath21 this condition guarantees that the rotation of the ring balances the gravitational self - attraction of the ring .    the black ring has a curvature singularity at @xmath22 .",
    "the regular event horizon of topology @xmath23 is at @xmath24 .",
    "the ergosphere is located at @xmath25 .",
    "the solution is asymptotically flat with the spatial infinity being located at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 the geometry ( [ metric s1 ] ) describes a static black ring without rotation , whose dynamical equilibrium is ensured by a conical singular disk whose pressure balances the self - gravitational attraction of the ring .",
    "we will be particularly interested in the large radius limit of ( [ metric s1 ] ) , which is defined by taking @xcite @xmath29 in the solution ( [ metric s1 ] ) , and keeping @xmath30 and @xmath31 finite . more particularly , take @xmath32 where @xmath5 and @xmath33 are constants .",
    "then the black ring solution ( [ metric s1 ] ) goes over to the boosted black string solution with horizon located at @xmath34 and with boost angle @xmath35 .",
    "this particular value of the boost angle is the one that follows from the balance condition ( [ equil cond s1 ] ) .",
    "this solution can also be constructed by applying a lorentz boost with angle @xmath33 to the geometry 4-dimensional ( 4d ) schwarzschild @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is the mass density of the black string extended along the @xmath37 direction .",
    "the black ring solution can be extended in order to include electric charge @xcite , as well as magnetic dipole charge @xcite .",
    "the most general known seven - parameter family of non - supersymmetric black ring solutions , that includes the above solutions as special cases , was presented in @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by three conserved charges , three dipole charges , two unequal angular momenta , and a parameter that measures the deviation from the supersymmetric configuration . in the black ring background",
    ", the penrose process was discussed in @xcite , perturbations analysis in the large radius limit was carried in @xcite , and a ultrarelativistic boost of the black ring was considered in @xcite .",
    "the algebraic classification of the black ring is done in @xcite .",
    "there are also supersymmetric black rings that we will not discuss in this paper .",
    "a recent detailed discussion of the supersymmetric black ring system can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .      the 5d rotating black ring with rotation along @xmath1 ( and no rotation along @xmath0 ) was found by mishima and iguchi @xcite and figueras @xcite . in its most appropriate form for physical interpretation @xcite ,",
    "the line element is @xmath39 } , \\label{metric s2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 the coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 vary in the intervals defined in ( [ range xy ] ) . to avoid conical singularities at @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the period of the angular coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 must be given by @xmath41 however , the solution has a conical singularity at @xmath42 that signals the presence of a conical singular disk that balances the self - gravitational attraction of the ring .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 and @xmath43 must satisfy the relation @xmath44 where the lower bound guarantees that there is a horizon and the upper bound ensures the absence of closed timelike curves .",
    "this black ring has a curvature singularity , and a regular event horizon with topology @xmath23 .",
    "it is asymptotically flat with the spatial infinity being located at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the black ring has rotation along the azimuthal direction @xmath16 of the @xmath1 , and it also has an ergoregion .",
    "again , we will be interested in the large radius limit of ( [ metric s2 ] ) , which is defined by taking @xcite @xmath45 in the solution ( [ metric s2 ] ) , and keeping @xmath46 fixed . more concretely ,",
    "take @xmath47 where @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "then the black ring solution ( [ metric s2 ] ) goes over to the kerr black string solution extended along the @xmath37 direction , with mass density @xmath5 and rotation parameter @xmath43 along the azimuthal @xmath16 direction .",
    "this solution can also be constructed by adding a flat direction to the 4d kerr black hole , yielding 4d kerr @xmath36 .",
    "the most general 5d black ring solution  the doubly spinning black ring  is not yet known .",
    "this more general element of the family will have rotation both along the plane of the ring ( i.e. , along the @xmath0 direction parameterized by @xmath17 ) that will balance the self - gravitation of the ring , and along the azimuthal @xmath16 direction of the @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , when the rotation along @xmath1 vanishes this doubly spinning solution reduces to ( [ metric s1 ] ) , while when it is the rotation along @xmath0 that is absent it reduces to ( [ metric s2 ] ) .    although we do not still know the line element of the doubly spinning black ring",
    ", we do know the geometry that describes its large radius limit .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to convince ourselves ( see fig . [",
    "fig : br ] ) that in this limit it will be described by a boosted kerr black string extended along the @xmath37-direction .",
    "this black string is characterized by the mass density @xmath5 , by the boost angle @xmath48 , and by the rotation parameter @xmath43 along the azimuthal @xmath16-direction .",
    "this can also be constructed by adding a flat direction @xmath37 to the 4d kerr black hole , and then applying a lorentz boost to it , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this yields the boosted kerr black string geometry , @xmath51 where @xmath52 when we set @xmath53 and @xmath48 , we get a boosted black string that describes a large radius skinny balanced black ring that is also found by taking the limit ( [ limit s1 ] ) , ( [ coord transf s1 ] ) in ( [ metric s1 ] ) .",
    "unbalanced rings give boosted black strings with a general @xmath33 . in the data examples that we will give in the paper ,",
    "we will fix @xmath33 to have the balanced value . on the other side ,",
    "if we set @xmath54 we get a kerr black string that describes a large radius skinny black ring that is also obtained by taking the limit ( [ limit s2 ] ) , ( [ coord transf s2 ] ) in ( [ metric s2 ] ) .",
    "the boosted kerr black string has a curvature singularity at @xmath55 , a cauchy horizon @xmath56 and an event horizon @xmath57 at @xmath58 , and an ergosurface at @xmath59 . to avoid naked singularities , the rotation is constrained to be @xmath60 .",
    "three important parameters of the boosted kerr black string are the angular velocity of the horizon along the @xmath16-coordinate , @xmath61 , the area per unit length of the horizon , @xmath62 , and the temperature of its horizon , @xmath63 , given by @xmath64 for completeness note that the linear velocity of the horizon along the string direction , @xmath65 , is given by @xmath66 .",
    "in this section we will show that a boosted kerr black string is unstable , against massless field perturbations , due to the combined effect of the superradiant mechanism and of the presence of an effective reflective wall sourced by the kk momentum of the mode along the string direction .",
    "this wall provides the arena for the existence of bound states .",
    "the mechanism at play in this instability was recently described in @xcite ) , and is active in _ some _ extended rotating black objects .",
    "the massless scalar field acquires an effective mass ( due to the kk momentum in the extra dimension ) and this makes the wave bounce back and forth . in each scattering",
    "the wave suffers superradiant amplification in the ergosphere and this leads to an instability @xcite .",
    "this superradiant instability will also be present in the case of electromagnetic and gravitational waves .",
    "we extend the analysis carried in @xcite for kerr black strings to the boosted case , and then we further extend this analysis to the black ring case .",
    "generically , the results for boosted black strings are in a way the same as the `` boosted results '' of unboosted black strings .",
    "however , we must be cautious since some exceptions to this rule are already known .",
    "for example , a boosted black string has an ergoregion and the penrose process can occur in this region , while in the unboosted case this phenomena is not present @xcite . as another example , it was recently shown @xcite that sorkin s critical dimension @xcite  below which stable black strings and small black holes on a compact circle can coexist  is boost dependent and actually vanishes for large boosts .",
    "therefore , the boosted results do not seem to follow trivially from the unboosted ones . as explained in @xcite , this",
    "is intimately connected with the different boundary conditions in the two systems .",
    "the evolution of a scalar field @xmath67 in the background of ( [ metric ] ) is governed by the curved space klein - gordon equation , @xmath68 .",
    "it is appropriate to use the separation ansatz @xmath69 where @xmath70 are spheroidal angular functions , and the azimuthal number @xmath71 takes on integer ( positive or negative ) values . for our purposes , it is enough to consider positive @xmath72 s in ( [ ansatz ] ) . inserting this ansatz into the klein - gordon equation , we get the following angular and radial wave equations for @xmath70 and @xmath73 , @xmath74s^m _",

    ", we must also specify the appropriate boundary conditions for the instability problem .",
    "the features of these boundary conditions reveal the two ingredients responsible for the presence of the instability .",
    "we are interested in wave perturbations that develop in the vicinity of the horizon and that propagate both into the horizon and out to infinity .",
    "our boundary conditions therefore require only ingoing flux at the horizon and only outgoing waves at infinity .    at the horizon ,",
    "the second set of terms proportional to @xmath81 in ( [ separation rad ] ) can be neglected and the radial wave equation reduces to @xmath82 where we made use of @xmath83 which implies @xmath84 . at infinity , the radial wave equation ( [ separation rad ] ) is dominated by @xmath85 where we used @xmath86 as @xmath87 . here , or in ( [ separation rad ] ) , we realize that the kk momentum @xmath88 contributes effectively as a mass term , @xmath89 , in the wave equation .",
    "the solutions of these two equations that satisfy our boundary conditions are @xmath90 where we have defined @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath63 and @xmath93 are , respectively , the temperature and the angular velocity of the horizon of the boosted kerr black string defined in ( [ boostedbs tva ] ) .    the features of the boundary conditions ( [ bound cond ] ) reveal the two ingredients responsible for the presence of the instability . indeed ,",
    "at infinity we identify the presence of the kk term or mass term , @xmath94 , that is responsible for the effective reflective wall .",
    "on the other side , at the horizon one identifies the presence of the so - called superradiant factor @xmath95 .",
    "when the frequency of the wave is such that @xmath95 is negative , @xmath96 one is in the superradiant regime , and the amplitude of a ( co - rotating ) wave is amplified after each scattering .",
    "it is important to understand why it is @xmath97 and not @xmath98 that describes always an ingoing wave at the horizon , since this is the key source of superradiance .",
    "it follows from ( [ ansatz ] ) and ( [ bound cond ] ) that at the horizon the wave solution behaves as @xmath99 .",
    "the phase velocity of the wave is then @xmath100 .",
    "now , the value of this phase velocity can be positive or negative depending on the value of @xmath72 ( when we fix the other parameters ) , so one might question if the first line of ( [ bound cond ] ) really describes _ always _ an ingoing wave .",
    "as in other applications , what is relevant to find the _",
    "physical _ ingoing wave solution at the horizon is the group velocity of the wave rather than its phase velocity .",
    "the normalized group velocity , @xmath101 , at the horizon is @xmath102 .",
    "this is a negative value that signals that the horizon wave solution in ( [ bound cond ] ) always represents an ingoing wave _ independently _ of the value of @xmath72 , and is thus the correct physical boundary condition .",
    "however , note that in the superradiant regime ( [ super cond ] ) , the phase velocity is positive and so waves appear as outgoing to an inertial observer at spatial infinity  energy is in fact being extracted .",
    "notice that ( since we are working with positive @xmath72 ) superradiance will occur only for positive @xmath71 , i.e. , for waves that are co - rotating with the black hole .",
    "indeed , the wave function is given by @xmath103 .",
    "the phase velocity along the angle @xmath16 is then @xmath104 , which for @xmath105 and @xmath106 is positive , i.e. , is in the same sense as the angular velocity @xmath93 of the black string .",
    "the necessary conditions  superradiant regime and presence of the kk effective mass term  are not , in general , sufficient to guarantee that a instability develops in the geometry as we shall conclude in section [ sec : hi dim ] .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions are that the superradiant regime is active and that _ bound states _ are present .",
    "the requirement of these conditions is better understood by re - writting the radial wave equation ( [ separation rad ] ) in the schr@xmath108dinger - like form , @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the usual tortoise coordinate @xmath110 .",

[",
    "fig : potential 4d].(a ) and [ fig : potential 4d].(b ) , the potential @xmath114 has a well that is limited at infinity by the kk momentum potential barrier of height @xmath88 .",
    "modes with a frequency greater than the bottom of the well , @xmath116 , and smaller than @xmath88 , @xmath117 , are bound states .",
    "if these bound state frequencies further satisfy the superradiant condition ( [ super cond ] ) , an instability will settle down : the waves will bounce back and forth between the kk wall at infinity and the black hole , amplifying itself each time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : potential 4d].(a ) ) . if the bound state frequencies do not satisfy the superradiant condition ( [ super cond ] ) the modes will bounce back and forth in the potential well , but each time part of the wave will tunnel to the horizon until the full mode is completely absorbed by the horizon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : potential 4d].(b ) ) .    here",
    "we note that when we set the rotation parameter to zero , @xmath53 ( boosted schwarzschild black string ) , we always get potentials of the form represented in fig . [",
    "fig : potential 4d].(b ) , for any @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    ", the wave solution of the klein - gordon equation is everywhere described by ( [ far field ] ) , subjected to the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the outer boundary condition requires the presence of only outgoing waves and this implies @xmath177 .",

    "the solution is described by @xmath186 ( 2\\eta r)^{-l-1}$ ] @xcite .",
    "so , when @xmath185 , the wavefunction @xmath184 diverges , @xmath187 . to have a regular solution there we must then demand that @xmath188 .",

    "therefore , the requirement of regularity imposes the condition @xmath191 . since @xmath192 is related to @xmath72 , the above regularity demanding amounts to a natural selection of the allowed frequencies that can propagate in the geometry .",
    "now , let us come back to the boosted kerr black string background , which differs clearly from the above background due to the existence of a horizon . in the spirit of @xcite , we expect that the presence of an horizon induces a small complex imaginary part in the allowed frequencies , @xmath193 $ ] , that describes the slow decay of the amplitude of the wave if @xmath194 , or the slowly growing instability of the mode if @xmath195 .",

    "however , with the present knowledge , we can still address partially this question .",
    "indeed , we can keep the approximation in which we use the boosted kerr black string as a toy - model for the doubly spinning black ring , but now we compactify the transverse direction , @xmath218 , and we decrease slowly @xmath9 . in this case the kk momentum of a mode that propagates in the geometry gets quantized and can take only discrete values : @xmath219 , with @xmath220 being an integer .",
    "this discretization of @xmath88 has important consequences .",
    "indeed , now there is a minimum value for @xmath88 and thus there is a non - vanishing minimum for the critical rotation @xmath221 below which there is no superradiance and no instability .",
    "so we expect that a finite radius doubly spinning black ring will loose angular momentum along @xmath1 and will stabilize into a doubly spinning black ring with small , but non - vanishing , rotation along @xmath1 .",
    "the superradiant instability will effectively impose an upper bound on the rotation along @xmath1 .",
    "we can estimate the value of this upper bound . to stabilize the system superradiance can not be present , i.e. , we must have @xmath222 , with @xmath95 defined in ( [ superrad factor ] ) . as we see in tables [ tab : var a]-[tab : a crit ] , the unstable modes are waves with @xmath223\\sim \\kappa$ ] .",
    "therefore , in ( [ superrad factor ] ) we can replace the frequency by the kk momentum .",
    "use of @xmath224 yields that superradiance and hence the instability will be absent for black rings that satisfy the relation @xmath225 we can cast this relation in a more interesting form that gives an uper bound for the conserved angular momentum of the ring along @xmath1 . to do so",

    "note that @xmath239 also suggests that @xmath240 .",
    "that is , doubly spinning black rings will also have an upper bound for the angular momentum along @xmath0 , contrary to what happens with the black ring rotating only along @xmath0 .",

    "the string model depends on four independent parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath57 , @xmath33 and @xmath43 , which correspond respectively to the size of the loop , thickness of the loop , tangential boost velocity along the loop , and rotation transverse to the loop @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ conserv adm ] ) gives only three relations between the above four parameters for a fixed configuration of conserved charges .",
    "the fourth parameter is fixed by demanding that the ring acquires a configuration that maximizes its entropy @xcite .",
    "this last quantity is computed using the area per unit length of the horizon , @xmath62 , defined in ( [ boostedbs tva ] ) .",
    "one finds that the entropy is given by @xmath242 , where the last approximation is valid in the small rotation regime . in the model of @xcite",
    ", it was found that this entropy is maximized for @xmath243 .",
    "use of ( [ conserv adm ] ) now allows us to write both @xmath57 and @xmath9 as a function of the conserved charges .",
    "then , the upper bound for the adm angular momentum along @xmath1 can finally be written as @xmath244 where we have set @xmath245 , since we do not expect high multipoles to be excited in a slowly rotating ring along @xmath16 .",
    "this is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "basically , it is telling us that the instability provides a dynamical mechanism that bounds the rotation of the doubly spinning black ring along @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note that the demand of a regular horizon in the yet to be found doubly spinning black ring will introduce a different upper bound for the rotation .",
    "the question is then if the upper bound imposed dynamically by the instability is or not smaller than the kerr - like upper bound imposed by the existence of a regular horizon . to address this issue heuristically , and since @xmath241 plays a minor role in this instability , we make use of the black ring that rotates along @xmath1 ( see section [ brs2 ] @xcite ) . the comparison is more clear when the relations are written in terms of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath5 .",
    "we first rewrite ( [ endpoint 2 ] ) in terms of @xmath43 yielding @xmath246 , in the limit @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "next , we use the first relation of ( [ coord transf s2 ] ) in the first inequality of ( [ equil cond s2 ] ) to write the horizon bound as @xmath249 ( as expected , since in the large radius limit this is the kerr bound ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath250 , the instability plays an important role in the evolution of the solution , i.e. , the instability will afflict large radius black rings but not small radius black rings .    0.2 cm    recently it has been conjectured the existence of higher dimensional black rings with horizon topology @xmath251 , with @xmath252 @xcite .",
    "evidence for this existence has already been given in @xcite , where a toy model for these objects was constructed .",
    "the large radius limit of these higher dimensional black rings will naturally be a boosted myers - perry black string .",
    "we have searched for a similar instability in these geometries but we have found no superradiant instability .",
    "the stability of the myers - perry black string against this mechanism was established by cardoso and yoshida @xcite .",
    "we have concluded that boosting the myers - perry black string does not change its superradiant stability .",
    "again , the best way to understand the reason is to look to the schr@xmath253dinger - like wave equation and its factorized potentials as was done in section [ sec : hi dim ] .",
    "although superradiance is still possible , the instability for @xmath254 is not present because the kk momentum is not able to produce trapped bound states .",
    "this is clearly seen in the schr@xmath253dinger factorized potentials shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential hid].(a ) .",
    "again we can extend the analysis to black rings with finite radius . a similar reasoning as the one of the previous paragraph together with the absence of instability leads to the prediction that higher dimensional doubly ( multiply ) spinning black rings will not have a superradiant upper bound for their rotations along @xmath255 .",
    "the situation is somewhat similar to the kerr / myers - perry black hole : the kerr and 5d myers - perry solutions have an upper rotation bound but @xmath256 myers - perry black holes do not .",
    "however , we expect that another dynamical process  the ultra - spin mechanism @xcite  might introduce a bound in the rotation .",

    "an example would be a black object with topology @xmath258 in odd @xmath259 dimensions . in principle",
    "the large radius limit of these multiply spinning black objects will be a boosted myers - perry membrane , i.e. , ( in the previous example ) a @xmath260-dimensional myers - perry black hole extended along @xmath261 flat boosted directions .",
    "these black rings will also be stable against superradiant bound modes since the kk contribution , due to the @xmath262-brane on the wave equation , is not effectively different from the one coming from a single line .",
