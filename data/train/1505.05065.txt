    "ii ) we find that it satisfies detailed balance , and gives better agreement than lsc - ivr with the exact quantum result.@xcite we suspect ( but have not yet proved ) that matsubara dynamics reproduces the time - dependence of the exact kubo - transformed time - correlation function up to order @xmath0 , and is thus the correct theory for describing quantum statistics and classical dynamics .",
