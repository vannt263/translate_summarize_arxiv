    "in 1974 , mathews and lakshmanan @xcite introduced a classical nonlinear oscillator as a one - dimensional analogue of some quantum field theoretical models .",
    "this system was described by a lagrangian @xmath0 which was a @xmath1-dependent deformation of that of the standard harmonic oscillator .",
    "apart from the nonlinearity of the oscillator potential , it presented the interesting feature of containing a position - dependent mass term in the kinetic energy . as a result ,",
    "the equation of motion @xmath2 had some solutions with a simple quasi - harmonic form , with the restriction that the frequency was amplitude dependent .",
    "a lot of studies have been devoted to this nonlinear oscillator , to its quantum version , and to some generalizations thereof .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that using a position - dependent mass was equivalent to changing the measure on the line , which is a general property of position - dependent mass systems @xcite .",
    "this allowed the quantization of the hamiltonian function corresponding to ( [ eq : l ] ) without having to solve the usual ordering ambiguity problem of the momentum and mass operators @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-dependent eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian were obtained in explicit form @xcite by taking advantage of the factorization and deformed shape invariance methods ( see also ref .",
    "the classical polynomials arising in the bound - state wavefunctions were identified later on @xcite .",
    "some generalized quantum potentials were also proposed and the corresponding schrdinger equations were solved @xcite .    on the other hand , a two - dimensional ( and more generally @xmath3-dimensional ) version of the one - dimensional system ( [ eq : l ] ) was proposed and studied both at the classical @xcite and at the quantum @xcite levels . in both cases , the solutions were given , the system was shown to be superseparable and superintegrable , and the model was related to that of the harmonic oscillator in spaces of constant curvature @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that in classical mechanics all the bounded motions were quasiperiodic oscillations and that the unbounded ( scattering ) motions were represented by hyperbolic functions , as in one dimension .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to reconsider the one - dimensional model with the same kinetic energy term as in ( [ eq :",
    "l ] ) , but with two more general nonlinear oscillator potentials .    in secs .",
    "ii and iii , the generalized potentials are presented , the corresponding euler - lagrange equations are solved and their solutions are compared with those of ( [ eq : e - l ] ) . finally , sec .",
    "iv contains the conclusion .",
    "let us consider the potential @xmath5 depending on an additional parameter @xmath6 and reducing to the mathews and lakshmanan potential for @xmath6 going to zero .",
    "we will distinguish between two cases according to the sign of the deformation parameter @xmath1 : @xmath7    in the first case , the potential goes to @xmath8 at both ends of the interval @xmath9 . between its two zeros at @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ", it has a minimum @xmath12 in the second case , the potential , which goes to @xmath13 for @xmath14 , has still two zeros at @xmath10 and @xmath15 , between which it has a minimum @xmath16 however , this time , for @xmath17 there also occurs a maximum @xmath18    , @xmath19 , as a function of @xmath20 , for @xmath21 ( solid line ) and @xmath22 ( dashed line ) . ]    , @xmath23 , as a function of @xmath20 , for @xmath24 ( solid line ) and @xmath22 ( dashed line ) . ]    in figs .  1 and 2 ,",
    "some examples are plotted and compared with the @xmath25 case .",
    "apart from the symmetry breaking with respect to parity that occurs when @xmath6 becomes nonvanishing , no substantial change is noted in the @xmath26 case since the potential remains a well with boundless walls at @xmath27 , thus allowing only bounded trajectories .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath28 case , the advent of a maximum for @xmath29 produces some changes : if for small energies , the trajectories remain bounded , for @xmath30 there is now a distinction between the unbounded trajectories below or above the maximum @xmath31 , as well as two limiting unbounded motions at @xmath32 and @xmath33 instead of a single one at @xmath32 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the euler - lagrange equation ( [ eq : e - l ] ) now becomes @xmath34 to solve this equation , we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , let us set @xmath35 , so that we obtain a first - order equation for @xmath36 , @xmath37 whose general solution is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is some integration constant .",
    "second , from ( [ eq : p^2 ] ) , we deduce the equation @xmath40 which can be easily integrated .",
    "for such a purpose , we use either eq .",

    "the result @xmath44 can then be inverted to yield @xmath45 .    to provide some physically - relevant results ,",
    "it is worth observing that the value of the integration constant @xmath39 is directly related to the energy @xmath46 of the system .",

    "in contrast , the hyperbolic - cosine - dependent unbounded solutions constitute a new type of solutions , with no counterpart in the @xmath108 limit .",
    "it is worth observing too that due to the presence of a bump in the potential , for each energy there are actually two solutions : one on the right extending over the interval @xmath109 , and one on the left , spreading over the interval @xmath110 .",
    "finally , it may be noted that the limiting unbounded solution , which was linear , has been replaced by quadratic and exponential ones .",
