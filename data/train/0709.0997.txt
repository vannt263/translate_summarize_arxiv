    "the investigation of critical behavior of disordered systems remains one of the main problems in condensed matter physics and excites a great interest , because all real solids contain structural defects .",
    "the structural disorder breaks the translational symmetry of the crystal and thus greatly complicates the theoretical description of the material .",
    "the influence of disorder is particularly important near critical point where behavior of a system is characterized by anomalous large response on any even weak perturbation . in most investigations consideration",
    "has been restricted to the case of point - like uncorrelated defects @xcite .",
    "however , the non - idealities of structure can not be modeled by simple uncorrelated defects only .",
    "solids often contain defects of a more complex structure : linear dislocations , planar grain boundaries , clusters of point - like defects , and so on .",
    "different models of structural disorder have arisen as an attempt to describe such complicated defects . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on model of weinrib and halperin ( wh ) @xcite with the so - called long - range correlated disorder when pair correlation function for point - like defects @xmath0 falls off with distance as a power law @xmath1 .",
    "weinrib and halperin showed that for @xmath2 long - range correlations are irrelevant and the usual short - range harris criterion @xcite @xmath3 of the effect of point - like uncorrelated defects is realized , where @xmath4 is the spatial dimension , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the correlation - length and the specific - heat exponents of the pure system . for @xmath7 the extended criterion @xmath8 of the effect of disorder on the critical behavior was established . as a result",
    ", a wider class of disordered systems , not only the three - dimensional diluted ising model with point - like uncorrelated defects , can be characterized by a new type of critical behavior .",
    "so , for @xmath7 a new long - range ( lr ) disorder stable fixed point ( fp ) of the renormalization group recursion relations for systems with a number of components of the order parameter @xmath9 was discovered .",
    "the critical exponents were calculated in the one - loop approximation using a double expansion in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the correlation - length exponent was evaluated in this linear approximation as @xmath12 and it was argued that this scaling relation is exact and also holds in higher order approximation . in the case @xmath13 the accidental degeneracy of the recursion relations in the one - loop approximation did not permit to find lr disorder stable fp .",
    "et al _ @xcite proved the existence of the lr disorder stable fp for the one - component wh model and also found characteristics of this type of critical behavior .",
    "ballesteros and parisi @xcite have studied by monte carlo means the critical behavior in equilibrium of the 3d site - diluted ising model with lr spatially correlated disorder , in the @xmath14 case corresponding to linear defects .",
    "they have computed the critical exponents of these systems with the use of the finite - size scaling techniques and found that a @xmath15 value is compatible with the analytical predictions @xmath12 .    however",
    ", numerous investigations of pure and disordered systems performed with the use of the field - theoretic approach show that the predictions made in the one - loop approximation , especially based on the @xmath16 - expansion , can differ strongly from the real critical behavior @xcite .",
    "therefore , the results for wh model with lr correlated defects received based on the @xmath17 - expansion @xcite was questioned in our paper @xcite , where a renormalization analysis of scaling functions was carried out directly for the 3d systems in the two - loop approximation with the values of @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 , and the fps corresponding to stability of various types of critical behavior were identified .",
    "the static and dynamic critical exponents in the two - loop approximation were calculated with the use of the pade - borel summation technique .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite essentially differ from the results evaluated by a double @xmath17 - expansion .",
    "the comparison of calculated the exponent @xmath15 values and ratio @xmath20 showed the violation of the relation @xmath21 , supposed in @xcite as exact .",
    "the models with lr - correlated quenched defects have both theoretical interest due to the possibility of predicting new types of critical behavior in disordered systems and experimental interest due to the possibility of realizing lr - correlated defects in the orientational glasses @xcite , polymers @xcite , and disordered solids containing fractal - like defects @xcite or dislocations near the sample surface @xcite .    to shed light on the reason of discrepancy between the results of monte carlo simulation of the 3d ising model with lr - correlated disorder @xcite , in the @xmath14 case , and the results of our renormalization group description of this model @xcite , we have computed by the short - time dynamics method @xcite the static and dynamic critical exponents for site - diluted 3d ising and xy models with the linear defects of random orientation in a sample .",
    "in the following section , we introduce a site - diluted 3d ising model with the linear defects and scaling relations for the short - time critical dynamics . in section  [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "we give results of critical temperature determination for 3d ising model with the linear defects for case with spin concentration @xmath22 .",
    "we analyze the critical short - time dynamics in ising systems starting separately from ordered and disordered initial states .",
    "critical exponents obtained under these two conditions with the use of the corrections to scaling are compared .",
    "also , in section  [ sec:3 ] the results of measurements of the critical characteristics for 3d ising model in equilibrium state are presented in comparison with results of the short - time dynamics method . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "the results of monte carlo studies of critical behavior of 3d xy - model with linear defects for the same spin concentration @xmath22 are considered .",
    "our main conclusions are discussed in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "we have considered the following ising model hamiltonian defined in a cubic lattice of linear size @xmath23 with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath24 where the sum is extended to the nearest neighbors , @xmath25 are the usual spin variables , and the @xmath26 are quenched random variables ( @xmath27 , when the site @xmath28 is occupied by spin , and @xmath29 , when the site is empty ) , with lr spatial correlation .",
    "an actual @xmath26 set will be called a sample from now on .",
    "we have studied the next way to introduce the correlation between the @xmath26 variables for wh model with @xmath14 , corresponding to linear defects .",
    "we start with a filled cubic lattice and remove lines of spins until we get the fixed spin concentration @xmath30 in the sample .",
    "we remove lines along the coordinate axes only to preserve the lattice symmetries and equalize the probability of removal for all the lattice points .",
    "this model was referred in @xcite as the model with non - gaussian distribution noise and characterized by the isotropic impurity - impurity pair correlation function decays for large @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite we put a condition of linear defects disjointness on their distribution in a sample , whereas in @xcite the possibility of linear defects intersection is not discarded .",
    "the physical grounds for this condition are connected with fact that in real materials dislocations as linear defects are distributed uniformly in macroscopic sample with probability of their intersection close to zero .",
    "the condition of linear defects disjointness corresponds to wh model since the intersection of linear defects being taken into consideration results in additional vertices of interaction which are absent in the effective hamiltonian of wh model .    in this paper",
    "we have investigated systems with the spin concentration @xmath22 .",
    "we have considered the cubic lattices with linear sizes @xmath23 from 16 to 128 .",
    "the metropolis algorithm has been used in simulations .",
    "we consider only the dynamic evolution of systems described by the model a in the classification of hohenberg and halperin @xcite .",
    "the metropolis monte carlo scheme of simulation with the dynamics of a single - spin flips reflects the dynamics of model a and enables us to compare the obtained dynamical critical exponent @xmath33 with the results of our renormalization group description of critical dynamics of this model @xcite having lr - disorder .",
    "a lot of results have been recently obtained concerning the critical dynamical behavior of statistical models @xcite in the macroscopic short - time regime .",
    "this kind of investigation was motivated by analytical and numerical results contained in the papers of janssen _ et al _ @xcite and huse @xcite .",
    "important is that extra critical exponents should be introduced to describe the dependence of the scaling behavior for thermodynamic and correlation functions on the initial conditions .",
    "according to the argument of janssen , schaub and schmittman @xcite obtained with the renormalization group method , one may expect a generalized scaling relation for the @xmath34-th moment of the magnetization @xmath35 is realized after a time scale @xmath36 which is large enough in microscopic sense but still very small in macroscopic sense . in ( [ eq : kmagn ] ) @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath15 are the well - known static critical exponents and @xmath33 is the dynamic exponent , while the new independent exponent @xmath38 is the scaling dimension of the initial magnetization @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the reduced temperature .",
    "since the system is in the early stage of the evolution the correlation length is still small and finite size problems are nearly absent .",
    "therefore we generally consider @xmath23 large enough and skip this argument .",
    "we now choose the scaling factor @xmath41 so that the main @xmath42-dependence on the right is cancelled .",
    "expanding the scaling form ( [ eq : kmagn ] ) for @xmath43 with respect to the small quantity @xmath44 , one obtains @xmath45 where @xmath46 has been introduced . for @xmath47 and small enough @xmath42 and @xmath39",
    "the scaling dependence for magnetization ( [ eq : theta ] ) takes the form @xmath48 . for almost all statistical systems",
    "studied up to now @xcite , the exponent @xmath49 is positive , i.e. , the magnetization undergoes surprisingly a critical initial increase .",
    "the time scale of this increase is @xmath50 .",
    "however , in the limit of @xmath39 the time scale goes to infinity .",
    "hence the initial condition can leave its trace even in the long - time regime .    if @xmath51 , the power law behavior is modified by the scaling function @xmath52 with corrections to the simple power law , which will be depended on the sign of @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , simulation of the system for temperatures near the critical point allows to obtain the time dependent magnetization with non - perfect power behavior , and the critical temperature @xmath54 can be determined by interpolation .",
    "other two interesting observables in short - time dynamics are the second moment of magnetization @xmath55 and the auto - correlation function @xmath56 as the spatial correlation length in the beginning of the time evolution is small , for a finite system of dimension @xmath4 with lattice size @xmath23 the second moment @xmath57 .",
    "combining this with the result of the scaling form ( [ eq : kmagn ] ) for @xmath47 and @xmath41 , one obtains @xmath58 furthermore , careful scaling analysis shows that the auto - correlation also decays by a power law @xcite @xmath59 thus , the investigation of the short - time evolution of system from a high - temperature initial state with @xmath60 allows to determine the dynamic exponent @xmath33 , the ratio of static exponents @xmath61 and a new independent critical exponent @xmath49 .    till now a completely disordered initial state has been considered as starting point , i.e. , a state of very high temperature .",
    "the question arises how a completely ordered initial state evolves , when heated up suddenly to the critical temperature . in the scaling form ( [ eq : kmagn ] ) one can skip besides @xmath23 , also the argument @xmath62 @xmath63 the system is simulated numerically by starting with a completely ordered state , whose evaluation is measured at or near the critical temperature .",
    "the quantities measured are @xmath64 , @xmath55 . with @xmath41 one",
    "avoids the main @xmath42-dependence in @xmath65 , and for @xmath43 one has @xmath66 for @xmath47 the magnetization decays by a power law @xmath67 . if @xmath51 , the power law behavior is modified by the scaling function @xmath68 . from this fact , the critical temperature @xmath54 and the critical exponent @xmath69 can be determined .",
    "we must note , that the short - time dynamic method in part of critical evolution description of system starting from the ordered initial state is essentially the same as the non - equilibrium relaxation method proposed by n.  ito in @xcite for critical behavior study of three - dimensional pure ising model . at present , this method was extended by n.  ito to non - equilibrium relaxation study of ising spin glass models @xcite , kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite and fully frustrated xy models in two dimension @xcite .    from scaling form ( [ eq : moder ] ) the power law of time dependence for the logarifmic derivative of the magnetization can be obtained in the next form @xmath70 which allows to determine the ratio @xmath71 . on basis of the magnetization and its second moment the time dependent binder cumulant @xmath72 is defined . from its slope one can directly measure the dynamic exponent @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , from an investigation of the system relaxation from ordered initial state with @xmath62 the dynamic exponent @xmath33 and the static exponents @xmath37 and @xmath15 can be determined and their values can be compared with results of simulation of system behavior from disordered initial state with @xmath60 .",
    "we have performed simulations on three - dimensional cubic lattices with linear sizes @xmath23 from 16 to 128 , starting either from an ordered state or from a high - temperature state with zero or small initial magnetization .",
    "we would like to mention that measurements starting from from a completely ordered state with the spins oriented in the same direction ( @xmath62 ) are more favorable , since they are much less affected by fluctuations , because the quantities measured are rather big in contrast to those from a random start with @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , for careful determination of the critical temperature and critical exponents for 3d ising model with linear defects we begin to investigate the relaxation of this model from a completely ordered initial state .",
    "initial configurations for systems with the spin concentration @xmath22 and randomly distributed quenched linear defects were generated numerically .",

    "the present results of monte carlo investigations allow us to recognize that the short - time dynamics method is reliable for the study of the critical behavior of the systems with quenched disorder and is the alternative to traditional monte carlo methods .",
    "but in contrast to studies of the critical behavior of the pure systems by the short - time dynamics method , in case of the systems with quenched disorder corresponding to randomly distributed linear defects after the microscopic time @xmath165 there exist three stages of dynamic evolution . for systems starting from the ordered initial states ( @xmath62 ) in the time interval of 50 - 200 mcs , the power - law dependences are observed in the critical point for the magnetization @xmath64 , the logarithmic derivative of the magnetization @xmath95 and binder cumulant @xmath76 , which are similar to that in the pure system . in the time interval [ 450,900 ]",

    "the dynamic and static critical exponents were computed with the use of the corrections to scaling for the ising and xy models with linear defects , which demonstrate their good agreement with results of the field - theoretic description of the critical behavior of these models with long - range correlated disorder . in intermediate time interval of 200 - 400",

    "it was shown that the power - law dependences for the magnetization @xmath64 , the second moment @xmath55 and the autocorrelation @xmath150 are observed in the critical point , which are typical for the pure system in the interval [ 10,70 ] and for the disordered system in the interval [ 100,650 ] . in intermediate time interval",

    "the obtained values of exponents demonstrate a good agreement within the limits of statistical errors of simulation and numerical approximations with results of simulation of the pure ising model by the short - time dynamics method @xcite for the first time interval and with our results of simulation of the critical relaxation of this model from the ordered initial states .    also , we would like to note that over complicated critical dynamics of the systems with quenched disorder the accurate determination of the critical temperature is better to carry out in equilibrium state from the coordinate of the points of intersections of the curves specifying the temperature dependence of binder cumulants @xmath87 or ratio @xmath93 for different linear sizes @xmath23 of lattices .",
    "the obtained results for 3d xy - model confirm the strong influence of lr - correlated quenched defects on the critical behavior of the systems described by the many - component order parameter . as a result",
    ", a wider class of disordered systems , not only the three - dimensional ising model , can be characterized by a new type of critical behavior induced by quenched disorder .",
    "we are planning to continue the monte carlo study of critical behavior of the model with lr - disorder for different spin concentrations @xmath30 and investigate the universality of critical behavior of diluted systems with lr - disorder focusing on the problem of disorder independence of asymptotic characteristics .",
