    "2002 ) , in which case the large difference in flux between the primary and secondary at short wavelengths prevents detection of the secondary component and thus the measurement of the mass ratio for the system . in the raleigh - jeans regime , however , flux scales much less steeply as a function of mass .",

    "the observed template spectra @xcite that best matched our data were bs 8086 and gl 436 , spectral types k7 and m2.5 , consistent with @xcite .",

    "in addition to using observed templates , we also fit the components of rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 with synthetic template spectra , calculated from the updated nextgen models @xcite .",
    "this is desirable because observed template spectra have inherent radial velocity uncertainties , whereas the synthetic template spectra have no associated velocity measurement uncertainties .",

    "we were unable to determine consistent velocity solutions using synthetic templates for both the primary and secondary stars because of the poor fit of a synthetic secondary to the observed spectra .",

    "we combined our radial velocities for the primary and secondary stars with the 34 measurements for the primary star presented in @xcite and solved for the best - fit orbital elements in the @xmath13 sense .",

    "determination of the orbital solution from only the double - lined velocities yields results consistent with the combined single- and double - lined solution but with much larger uncertainties .",
    "we describe future work to improve our orbital fit in  4.4 .",
    "figure 3 shows the primary star velocities from @xcite along with ir determined radial velocities for both the primary and secondary stars plotted as a function of phase .",

    "the reliability of the solution is likely to be low because of the difficulty in measuring separations this far below the diffraction limit .",
    "we also note the possibility that rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 could be broadened by a lower ao correction rate during the observations as compared with that of the single star . however , the consistency of the flux ratio with the h - band spectroscopic values determined by cross - correlation provides support that we are seeing evidence of the companion in rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 .",
    "we do not see any extension in the 2004 december 24 images of rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 , which is consistent with the binary being near periastron , whereas in 2008 january the companion was approaching apastron .",

    "rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 , located just north of the central cluster in the barnard 30 dark cloud , could have experienced photoevaporation from the nearby b star at a young age , obliterating circumstellar material , although this is probably unlikely given the long survival time of proplyds in the trapezium @xcite .",
    "given the extremely high eccentricity of this binary , however , the action of the companion star may have precluded formation of , or dissipated any , circumstellar material . with an assumed primary star mass of 0.75 m@xmath19 and the mass function from torres et al .",

    "independent of the potentially harsh @xmath6 ori environment and the orbital dynamics of rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 , the system manifests spectra of similar surface gravity to dwarf stars , as well as a relatively small lithium equivalent width , in comparison to classical t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the lithium and h@xmath21 equivalent widths of @xcite for @xmath6 ori average greater than twice what is found for rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 and are consistent with the classical and weak - lined t - tauri limits defined by @xcite .",

    "a three body dynamical encounter between an object from outside of the binary and a companion short period binary could have stimulated the eccentricity of the system and tightened the orbit of a close ( secondary ) pair (  4.2 ) .",
    "the eventual formation of a circumbinary ( or circumtriple ) debris disk could have been stimulated by dynamical disruption of the disks in the system in any one of these scenarios .",
    "the formation of planets in binary systems has been observationally supported in recent years and is of primary significance since a majority of stars have companions @xcite . @xcite",
    "have determined the strict criteria for classifying stable and unstable planetary orbits in binary systems , however , their analysis is restricted to circular orbits .",
    "many of the extra - solar planets observed in binaries are in wide separation systems , where the mass ratio for the stellar components is near unity and the eccentricity of the system is low . @xcite have modeled the formation of terrestrial planets around individual stars in binaries and find that , for periastron distances of @xmath225  au , such planet formation is restricted .",
    "considering that the periastron distance in the rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 system is only 0.15  au , we conclude that the probability of even a low - mass circumstellar planet in rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 is remote .",
    "the trend determined by @xcite towards the formation of fewer circumbinary terrestrial planets in systems with apastron distances of @xmath270.2  au and non - zero eccentricities also bodes for poor circumbinary planetary stability around the stars in rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 .",
    "clearly it is imperative to improve the orbital solution for rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 , particularly the measurement of the mass ratio .",
    "visible light and especially infrared data are critical to obtain , preferably at high precisions .",
    "rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 passes through its next maximum velocity separation in late december , 2009 . densely sampled high signal - to - noise spectra taken during these epochs will yield a greatly improved precision for the orbital solution .",
    "if rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 is located at a distance of only 90  pc , an apastron separation of 2.30  au implies a maximum projected separation on the sky of @xmath30.03@xmath9 .",
    "much of the orbit of this system lies within reach of the diffraction limit of the 85  m baseline of the keck interferometer , 0.005@xmath9 .",
    "although the k@xmath1band magnitude of rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 , 9.2 , is relatively faint for observations with this facility , planned improvements to the system may eventually enable resolved observations of this unusual binary , permitting the determination of individual component masses .",
    "the 90  pc distance may also be confirmed by measuring the parallax , which is slightly greater than 10 mas at this distance , and is at the achievable limit of current instrumentation .",
    "@xcite reported the orbital solution for rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 based on single - lined spectroscopic data ; we have elaborated on this solution using near - ir data to identify the spectrum of the secondary star and determine the mass ratio of the system .",
    "the ir data alone presented in a primary vs. secondary velocity plot ( figure 2 ) indicate a mass ratio of 0.78@xmath20.05 . in concert with the visible light data , the full orbital solution yields a more uncertain mass ratio of 0.73@xmath20.23 ( table 3 ) .",
    "other orbital parameters are in good agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "this system is the most eccentric pre@xmath1main sequence double@xmath1lined binary known to date ( figure 4 ) and thus presents challenges to observation .",
    "it is an unlikely site for the formation of circumstellar planets , or of circumbinary planets with orbits within several au of the stars .",
    "the fact that the secondary component was not identified in visible light suggests a relatively faint and/or red companion . for an estimated primary mass of 0.75  m@xmath19",
    "the minimum mass of the secondary is 0.40  m@xmath19 .",
    "this implies a minimum mass ratio of 0.53 , consistent with the value in table 3 . a robust determination of the mass ratio along with the best estimate for the primary star mass will eventually provide an improved estimate for the secondary mass .",
    "on the basis of the center - of - mass velocity , common proper motion , a lack of near - ir excess , a tentative k - band ao detection of the secondary , lithium equivalent width , and 24  @xmath5 m _ spitzer _ excess evidence for a debris disk , we argue that the rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 system is a member of the 32 ori moving group , recently identified by @xcite . assuming a distance of 90  pc , we estimate an age for rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 of 15@xmath25  myr , consistent with that of @xcite for 32 ori .",
    "it is imperative to improve the orbital elements of rx  j0529.3@xmath01210 in order to determine a precise mass ratio for the system . in conjunction with future interferometric observations",
    ", this will ultimately yield component masses for this system .",
    "given its unusual eccentricity , proximity , young age , and debris disk , such observations are likely to reveal clues to the formation of this unique binary system as well as additional data for the improvement of pre - main sequence models .",
