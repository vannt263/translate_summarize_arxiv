    "a riemannian metric @xmath4 is called _ einstein _ if the ricci tensor @xmath5 satisfies the equation @xmath6 , for some @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath8 is compact , einstein metrics of volume 1 can be characterized variationally as the critical points of the scalar curvature functional @xmath9 on the space @xmath10 of riemannian metrics of volume 1 .",
    "if @xmath11 is a compact homogeneous space , a @xmath12-invariant einstein metric is precisely a critical point of @xmath13 restricted to the set of @xmath12-invariant metrics of volume 1 . as a consequence ,",
    "the einstein equation reduces to a system of non - linear algebraic equations , which is still very complicated but more manageable , and in some times can be solved explicity .",
    "thus most known examples of einstein manifolds are homogeneous .    in a recent work @xcite",
    "the first two authors classified all flag manifolds for which the isotropy representation decomposes into four pairwise inequivalent irreducible submodules , and found new invariant einstein metrics on these spaces .",
    "recall that a generalized flag manifold is an adjoint orbit of a compact semisimple lie group @xmath12 , or equivalently a compact homogeneous space of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the centralizer of a torus @xmath16 in @xmath12 .",
    "eventhough the problem of finding all invariant einstein metrics on @xmath8 can be facilitated by use of certain theoretical results ( e.g. the work @xcite on the total number of @xmath12-invariant complex einstein metrics ) , it still remains a difficult one , especially when the number of isotropy summands increases .",
    "this difficulty also increases when we pass from exceptional flag manifolds to classical flag manifolds , because in the later case the einstein equation reduces to a parametric system .",
    "in particular , eventhough all invariant einstein metrics were found for every generalized flag manifold with four isotropy summands , a partial answer was given for the spaces @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we summarize the results obtained in @xcite about these spaces .",

    "we find all @xmath0-invariant einstein metrics on the flag manifold @xmath17 , by using a new approach into manipulating the algebraic systems of equations obtained from the einstein equation .",
    "the coefficients of the polynomials in such systems involve parameters , so a major difficulty appears when we try to show existence and uniqueness of solutions .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the present work is , besides answering the original problem on einstein metrics , to give some insight towards the study of parametric systems of algebraic equations .",

    "since the point @xmath416 is inside of this triangle , it follows that the local minimum @xmath417 is greater than @xmath418 , and the claim has also been shown in this case .",
