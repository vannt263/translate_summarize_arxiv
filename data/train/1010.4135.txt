    "lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method has been becoming a powerful and efficient tool to simulate fluid flows in many areas @xcite , ranging from multiphase flows @xcite , magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , flows through porous media @xcite and thermal fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , most models so far work only for incompressible fluids .",
    "many attempts have been made in constructing lb models for the compressible euler equations .",
    "@xcite proposed a 13-discrete - velocity model based on the triangular lattice . in this model , particles at each node are classified into three kinds .",
    "they are on the energy levels @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , the energy level @xmath2 is higher than @xmath4 and is for the rest particle .",
    "similar to hu s model , yan and co - workers @xcite presented a 17-discrete - velocity model with three - speed - three - energy level on a square lattice .",
    "both models are two - dimensional ( 2d ) and belong to the standard lb model . in the standard lb model , particle velocities are restricted to those exactly linking the lattice nodes in unit time . besides the standard lb , finite difference ( fd ) lb is attracting more attention with time . with the fd lb model",
    "we do not need consider that constraint , we can choose particle velocities independently from the lattice configuration .",
    "shi et al .",
    "@xcite formulated a fd lb scheme based on a two - dimensional 9-velocity model .",
    "this model allows particles to possess both kinetic and thermal energies .",
    "kataoka and tsutahara @xcite presented a lb model series for the compressible euler equations , where 5 , 9 and 15 discrete velocities are used for the one- , two- and three - dimensional cases , respectively .",
    "however , all these models work only for subsonic flow . the low - mach number constraint is generally related to the numerical stability problem . the latter has been partly addressed by a few potential solutions , for example , the entropic method @xcite , flux limiters @xcite , dissipation techniques @xcite and multiple - relaxation - time lb approach @xcite .",
    "watari and tsutahara proposed a three - dimensional fd lb model for euler equations , where numerical simulations are successfully performed up to mach number 1.7 @xcite .",
    "but the number of discrete velocities in that model is up to 73 , which is quite expensive from the view of computational side .",
    "recently , a three - dimensional compressible fd lb model without free parameters was proposed @xcite , where 25 discrete velocities are used . with this model",
    "the momentum equations at the navier - stokes level and energy equation at the euler level can be recovered .",
    "the maximum mach number is 2.9 in simulations .",
