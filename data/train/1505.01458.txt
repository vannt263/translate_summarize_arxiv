    "as in visible wavelengths , ultraviolet flux from asteroids is reflected sunlight .",
    "however , the steep drop in the solar spectrum shortward of @xmath4300 nm ( figure 1 ) makes asteroids orders of magnitude fainter in the uv than in the visible . for this reason  as well as the strong uv absorption by atmospheric ozone  uv observations of asteroids",
    "typically employ the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) or specialized instruments on a space - mission payload physically closer to the asteroid .",
    "these constraints have generally prohibited large - sample demographic studies of asteroids in the uv .    predating _ hst _ , the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) targeted 45 asteroids from 19781992 , producing what remains to date the largest published sample of near - uv asteroid spectra @xcite , specifically in the range of 230325 nm .",
    "the _ iue _ data show evidence of clustering , principally with respect to geometric uv albedo .",
    "this clustering becomes further evident when coarsely - defined visible spectral type is included as a categorical parameter for each object ( c , s and m types being the classes considered in the original work ) .",
    "comparing the _ iue_-derived geometric uv albedos for each class with the geometric visible albedos demonstrated that the s types , which are redder - colored in the visible ( specifically , 400800 nm ) , remain redder than c types into the nuv .",
    "the _ iue _ data , combined with previously - measured visible spectra , suggested that asteroid reflectances over the entire near - uv to visible wavelength range ( 200800 nm ) are generally consistent with those of silica - bearing rocks ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . to first order ,",
    "this trend is characterized by an increase in a rock s reflectance at longer wavelengths , generally attributable to the decreased fraction of volume - scattered light , _",
    "i.e. _ , light which penetrates into the mineral grains .",
    "the intensity of volume - scattered light varies as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the grain size , @xmath7 is the imaginary part of the index of refraction , and @xmath8 is the wavelength . once refracted into the grains , volume - scattered light is subject to absorption by various ( @xmath8-dependent ) interactions with the mineral s crystalline structure . at sufficiently short wavelengths ( _ i.e. _ , well into the ultraviolet region ) , most incident light penetrates the grains and is absorbed , while the small amount of measured reflected light is predominantly scattered directly from the grain surface . precise characterization of this transition between surface - dominated and surface plus volume - scattered reflectance  as well as the identification of any additional mineral - specific spectral features  is therefore useful for tying astronomical observations of asteroids to laboratory - measured analogs , including lunar and meteoritic samples .",

    "asteroid observations differs somewhat from roettger and buratti s treatment of the _ iue _ data .",
    "first , instead of referencing taxonomic class labels ( _ e.g. _ , ` c type',`s type',`m type ' , etc . ) assigned to individual asteroids by previous authors , we define classes using a color index derived from a clustering analysis performed on a compilation of seven visible - color surveys @xcite .",
    "the brightest asteroids typically were targeted in one or more spectroscopic surveys_e.g .",
    "_ , the eight color asteroid survey ( ecas , @xcite ) or the small main - belt asteroid spectroscopic surveys ( smass ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "dimmer objects however often only have color information from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the color index of @xcite puts asteroids of all sizes on a single , quantitative color scale ( a proxy for spectral slope ) , the endmembers of which we identify with the c - type and s - type complexes .",
    "we use the terms ` c types ' and ` s types ' purely for compatibility with the literature , noting that our color index combined with the classification thresholds we apply to it represent original definitions of these two groups .",
    "use of a one - dimensional color metric sacrifices sensitivity to secondary taxonomic groups such as m types , d types and v types . while our purpose is mainly to examine the _ first - order _ taxonomic variation , in certain cases we divide our color - defined ` c types ' into two classes ( c@xmath13 and c@xmath14 ) on the basis of visible and near - infrared albedo ( as detailed in section 3.2 ) . at the end of this work",
    "we also examine well - established c - complex subgroups from both the tholen and bus / binzel taxonomies ( section 6 ) , showing how these known subgroups ( _ e.g. _ , m types and g types ) are distributed in this work s color - albedo space and highlighting these subgroups unique uv properties .",
    "a second distinction between this work s approach and @xcite is that , rather than comparing the _ geometric albedo _ in the uv with that of the visible band , we focus on the difference in _ apparent magnitudes _ between the uv and visible .",
    "one motivation for doing this is we need not make any assumptions about the phase function of asteroids in the uv .",
    "the challenge however is that we must accurately estimate the visible flux at the time of the uv observations . as discussed in section 3 , we adopt ( and compare ) two distinct methods for predicting the visual magnitude .",
    "the first method simply adopts the widely - used mpc ] predicted magnitudes ; the second method applies color - dependent phase - function and bond - albedo estimates adapted from the @xcite study of lightcurves from the palomar transient factory survey ] ( ptf ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "extracting detections of known asteroids from a survey involves a three - dimensional ( r.a . ,",

    "we modified software originally used to search for asteroids in ptf ( @xcite , @xcite ) to instead search for asteroids in _",
    "galex_.    we first retrieved the metadata of all _ galex _ images , available from the space telescope science institute via command - line queries with the casjobs tool @xcite .",
    "we then indexed all image centers with respect to ( r.a , dec . ) into uniformly - spaced sky cells of 3-degree radius .",
    "for all @xmath4380,000 numbered asteroids , we queried jpl s online service horizons @xcite to generate a 1-day - spaced ephemeris spanning 20032012 . using an object - specific search radius equal to 3 degrees ( cell radius ) plus 0.75 degrees ( fov radius ) plus the object s maximum 1-day motion ( @xmath410 arcminutes for most main - belt objects ) , we matched the ephemeris points against the sky cells . for each matched cell , we filtered out all images in that cell not within the epoch range of the matched ephemeris points , then for each surviving image we re - queried horizons for the precise location at each observed epoch .",
    "we next performed a 1.25-degree - radial match of these precise positions against the relevant _ galex _ image centers .",
    "we found @xmath4850,000 predicted detections of numbered asteroids ( with no limit on apparent magnitude ) in _ galex _ using this method .",

    "multiple matches near the same point occurring more than 6 hours apart were excluded , as were all matches further than 2@xmath9 from the predicted location .",
    "additionally , to ensure the inclusion of greater than ( approximately ) 5@xmath2 detections , we discarded all matches with nuv @xmath15 21 mag in the shorter exposures ( ais program ) , and discarded all matches with nuv @xmath15 22.7 mag in the longer exposures ( mis program ) , following the limiting magnitudes quoted by @xcite .    following the above procedure and criteria , we extracted a total of 1,342 positive nuv detections of 405 unique asteroids which were detected by _ galex _ at least twice ( and no fuv detections , as expected ) .",
    "these detections are listed in table 1 ; several histograms detailing these detections appear in figure 2 .",
    "all of the _ galex_-observed asteroids are in the main - belt ; the sample includes no near - earth or outer - solar system objects .",
    "in this section we consider two distinct methods of estimating the visible magnitudes corresponding to all _ galex _ nuv detections ; this in turn provides the distribution of the asteroids @xmath16 color .",
    "the general model for an asteroid s apparent visual magnitude @xmath1 ( log flux ) is    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the absolute magnitude ( a constant ) , @xmath19 is a periodic variability term due to rotation ( _ e.g. _ , if the object is spinning and has some asymmetry in shape or albedo ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the heliocentric and geocentric distances ( in au ) , and @xmath22 is the _ phase function _ , which varies with the solar phase angle @xmath23 ( the sun - asteroid - earth angle ) . when @xmath24 ( _ i.e. _ , at opposition ) , @xmath25 by definition , while in general @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 decreasing as @xmath23 increases ) .",
    "all asteroids for which we have extracted _ galex _ observations have known orbits , meaning @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath23 are accurately and precisely known at all observed epochs .",
    "our two methods for estimating @xmath1 differ in their assumptions regarding ( and observational data used to constrain ) @xmath18 and @xmath28 . in both cases",
    "we do not attempt to model the rotational term @xmath19 , but rather incorporate @xmath19 into the uncertainty of @xmath1 using lightcurve amplitude estimates from the literature . in particular , 388 of the 405 _ galex_-observed asteroids have an amplitude lower - limit estimate available in the lightcurve database ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the following sections we refer to two different albedo quantities . the visible - band _ geometric _ albedo @xmath29 relates to the visible - band _ bond _ albedo @xmath30 and the phase function @xmath28 ( of equation [ 1 ] ) according to    @xmath31    the above equation also defines the phase integral @xmath32 .",
    "the bond albedo @xmath30 is defined as the total visible light energy reflected or scattered by the asteroid ( in all directions ) divided by the total visible light energy incident upon the asteroid ( from the sun ) . assuming the asteroid has a circular cross - section of diameter @xmath33 , this can be expressed as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the asteroid s flux as a function of phase angle , with @xmath36 being equation ( 1 ) evaluated at @xmath37 and @xmath38 au ( similarly , @xmath39 ) .",
    "the first method for estimating @xmath1 adopts the minor planet center s computed absolute magnitudes ( @xmath41 ) , which are regularly updated by the mpc s automated processes and utilize the lumme - bowell @xmath42-parameter model for @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this same ( @xmath40 ) model then predicts the apparent magnitude @xmath10 as a function of solar phase angle .",
    "the @xmath41 values are fit to photometry provided by a variety of surveys / individuals , many of whom may use slightly different absolute calibration standards or filters with slightly different specifications .",
    "a small fraction of asteroids have fitted @xmath42 values ; @xcite present mean @xmath42 values for several major taxonomic classes , with @xmath43 being an average between the c types ( @xmath44 ) and the s types ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "for the majority of asteroids the mpc uses an assumed @xmath43 with this model .",
    "@xcite compares the @xmath41 values with @xmath18 magnitudes derived from a model that includes rotation and the more modern ( @xmath18,@xmath46 ) phase function of @xcite . among bright asteroids",
    "the relative difference is typically between 0.3% to 3% , corresponding to ( on average ) an @xmath40.07 mag discrepancy .",
    "though @xmath41 values are available for all 405 _ galex_-observed asteroids , we only consider the subset of 315 asteroids having visible - band color indices of either less than 0.25 ( ` c types ' ) or greater than 0.75 ( ` s types ' ) . of these ,",
    "41 asteroids have @xmath47 .",
    "our second means of estimating visual magnitudes applies only to asteroids having both a color index _ and _ a diameter estimate constrained from thermal fluxes in an infrared survey . in this approach",
    "we use the @xmath46-parameter model for @xmath28 @xcite , and we replace @xmath18 with its equivalent expression in terms of the diameter @xmath33 , bond albedo @xmath30 , and phase integral @xmath32 :    @xmath48    where the phase integral @xmath32 is a linear function of @xmath46 :    @xmath49    we again define ` c types ' as all asteroids with color indices less than 0.25 and ` s types ' as all with color indices greater than 0.75 . for s types",
    "we then consider diameters derived from any of four infrared surveys ( see footnote 3 ) , while for c types we specifically require that the asteroid have been observed in the _ wise _ 4-band cryogenic survey ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "figure 7 panels d  f attempt to ascertain whether such a trend exists by considering the median phase angle at which each asteroid was detected by _",
    "galex_.    c types are observed at a median median phase angle of 7.2 deg compared to the s types median median phase angle of 9.0 deg .",
    "this is explained by the fact that c types on average have larger semi - major axes , which geometrically correspond to lower observed phase angles from earth . within the c - type group ,",
    "median phase angle correlates with @xmath69 at @xmath86 ( 1.5@xmath2 significance ) and with @xmath70 at @xmath87 ( 0.1@xmath2 significance ) . among s types , median phase angle correlates with @xmath69 at @xmath87 ( 0.1@xmath2 significance ) and with @xmath70 at @xmath88 ( 0.5@xmath2 significance ) .",
    "we therefore can not claim any phase angle dependence for @xmath16 , regardless of the taxonomic group or @xmath1-model being considered .",
    "various works ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) discuss the phenomenon of asteroid phase reddening , _",
    "i.e. _ an observed reddening of visible color with increasing phase angle .",
    "very few survey - scale samples have been used to test for the presence of this effect .",
    "@xcite computed slightly different phase - angle dependences for the @xmath89 and @xmath90 colors of trojans in sdss , though these relations were not separately computed for the trojans two taxonomic groups .",
    "@xcite did not detect any statistically significant difference between @xmath46 fits to @xmath20-band ptf lightcurves and @xmath91-band ptf lightcurves ( among asteroids that had data in both bands ) .",
    "the extent to which a phase - function dependence on wavelength exists between the uv and visible remains unclear .",
    "future uv surveys such as _ ultrasat _ @xcite offer the most promising means of testing this hypothesis , especially because ( unlike _ galex _ ) they will obtain sufficient numbers of observations to adequately sample uv lightcurves , thereby providing the best possible data set for fitting uv phase functions .",
    "if we assume that the phase function does not differ significantly between the uv and visible ( or take figure 7 panels e and f as justification of this statement ) , then we can compare the relative _ bond albedo _ versus wavelength for the different taxonomic groups using measured colors , filter response functions and the solar spectrum .",
    "if the phase function _ does _ in fact vary significantly with wavelength , then this approach only provides the relative _ geometric albedo _ versus wavelength ( see equations [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] ) .",
    "assume photometry from two filters ( 1 and 2 ) produce the color measurement @xmath92 .",
    "this color relates to the solar flux distribution @xmath93 , the albedos in each band ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) and the filter responses @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) according to    @xmath98    which we adapted from a similar equation in @xcite .    using nuv as band 1 and @xmath1 as band 2 in equation 6 , we use the colors in table 3 ( specifically , the @xmath53-based colors ) to obtain the albedo ratio @xmath99 , with uncertainties coming from the associated scatter in the colors . in figure 7",
    "we plot these albedo ratios for the c types and s types , incorporating an additional uncertainty component from the transformation from @xmath20 to @xmath1 ( see @xcite for a discussion of this transformation in the context of asteroids ) .",
    "the end - computed values are @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the relative albedo values in the sdss bands included for comparison in figure 8 are taken directly from a figure in @xcite ; likewise the ecas data are taken directly from a figure in @xcite .",
    "note that figures 8 and 9 ignore the fact that the s types and c types _ absolute albedo _ in @xmath20-band differs .",
    "in other words , these plots could be converted into ones with absolute albedo on the vertical scale by multiplying the blue and red lines by their respective absolute @xmath20-band albedos , which would be similar to those listed in table 2 for @xmath1 band .",
    "assuming ( from table 2 ) that c types have @xmath102 , then @xmath103 , and assuming s types have @xmath104 , then @xmath105 .",
    "that is , s types have a higher mean nuv albedo than c types , similar to the visible .",
    "both c and s types show a continued trend of decreasing albedo at shorter wavelengths . whereas for s types this behavior was already well - established in the 300800 nm region , for c types",
    "the @xmath106 color had previously represented a significant deviation from the shallower slope observed from 400800 nm .",
    "the c - type @xmath107 albedo in figure 8 confirms the presence of a marked drop in albedo somewhere in the 200400 nm range .",
    "given the resolution of figure 8 and the uncertainties in the data points , we can not judge whether the c - type albedo levels off between nuv and @xmath3 band , or whether the slope between @xmath3 and @xmath91 bands persists into these shorter wavelengths .",
    "the _ iue _",

    "@xcite obtained _ hst _ photometry of asteroid 21 lutetia in uv and visible bands .",
    "lutetia has been classified by various authors as an m - type asteroid ; in the context of this work its color index is 0.05 ( making it a c type ) and its @xmath108 suggest it to be a c@xmath13 type in particular , though in this work s system we formally would require a _ wise _",
    "@xmath51 measurement to classify it as such . in the following section",
    "we show that m types ( a group in the tholen taxonomic system ) and our c@xmath13 types are largely the same population .",
    "the _ hst _ lutetia photometry revealed a steep drop in albedo around @xmath4300 nm and nearly constant albedo in the 200300 nm region at a factor @xmath40.6 times the visible ( @xmath20-band - equivalent ) albedo .",
    "the _ hst _ observations of lutetia thus generally agree with the c - type albedo trend ( figure 9 ) , the main difference being the location of the uv albedo drop - off ( the bluest two ecas bands also demonstrate this difference between m types and c types , _",

    "the _ rosetta _",
    "spacecraft s flyby of lutetia enabled fuv observations with the on - board alice uv imaging spectrograph @xcite ; the longest wavelengths of the fuv data ( @xmath4190 nm ) yield an albedo consistent with the constant value measured in the 200300 nm range by _ hst _ , namely @xmath40.6 times that of the visible albedo .",
    "_ hst _ photometry of asteroid 1 ceres has also been obtained in the uv and visible ( @xcite , @xcite ) . with a color index of 0.01 , ceres is also a c type in our classification scheme , though its @xmath109 makes its placement in our c@xmath14 vs. c@xmath13 groups ambiguous ( see figure 6 panel f ) . like lutetia , ceres lacks a reported @xmath51 so that we can not formally classify it as either c@xmath14 or c@xmath13 .",
    "ceres was observed by _ galex _ and thus is included in our mpc - data - based analysis ; our measured @xmath110 for ceres make it a clear outlier from the c - type @xmath111 distribution ( figure 4 panel b ) . in the tholen",

    "c types deserve further consideration for several reasons : ( 1 ) c types outnumber s types in the _ galex _ samples by a factor of several , ( 2 ) our division of c types into c@xmath14 and c@xmath13 merits interpretation in more conventional taxonomic systems , and ( 3 ) both of the _ hst_-observed asteroids in the previous section are known members of c - type subgroups , the uv properties of which are worth confirming with additional group members .    figures 10 and 11 detail the distribution of _",
    "galex_-observed asteroids belonging to six classes each from the tholen and bus / binzel taxonomic systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the latter is sometimes referred to as the smassii system after the survey data with which it was derived .",
    "these two classification systems were created on the basis of different visible - band color data ; a comparison of their group definitions is given in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "we consider only the subset of _",
    "galex_-observed asteroids having both @xmath10 and @xmath53 model magnitudes and omit subgroups containing less than three objects . in the following subsections we briefly comment on these subgroups .    one key interpretation of these data  supported also by the _ hst _ data in figure 9is that nuv - band albedo is not very useful for discriminating c - type subgroups , _",
    "e.g. _ , m types versus g types , whereas @xmath3 band appears to be more diagnostic in this regard .",
    "the @xmath3-band discrepancy between these subgroups was remarked most notably by @xcite in the ecas data , but it was unknown at that time ( indeed , up until now ) whether the discrepancy in uv albedo became more or less pronounced shortward of @xmath4300 nm . the nuv data indicate that the discrepancy lessens in the nuv , as m types do in fact exhibit a step - down in albedo ( between nuv and @xmath3 bands ) , similar to the step down the g types exhibit within @xmath3 band .      the tholen system s x - type group includes asteroids with relatively flat visible color , including no substantial absorption in the blue ( in contrast to , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath3-band drop - off seen in g types ) .",
    "the subgroups within the x group include e , m , and p types and are distinguishable only by albedo .    the twelve m types in our sample all have @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the latter formally makes them all c@xmath13 types in this work s classification system .",
    "the m types have @xmath115 and @xmath116 , neither of which significantly differ from the c - type averages given in table 3 .",
    "this is consistent with the above - noted observation that m - type lutetia s @xmath0 is similar to that of the _ galex _ c types , despite an obvious difference in @xmath3-band ( figure 9 ) .",
    "assuming _ all _ 29 of the c@xmath13 types in the _ galex _ sample are in fact m types , then the c@xmath13 types slightly higher @xmath117 ( compared to @xmath118 for the whole c type group ) agrees well with the m types slightly higher average .",
    "complementary to the m types , the eleven p types in our sample all have @xmath119 and @xmath120 , the latter formally makes them all c@xmath14 types .",
    "the p types have @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "these values are less than both models c - type averages as well as less than the c@xmath14 average , suggesting our c@xmath14 group includes more diverse objects than just p types ( _ e.g. _ , the five f types also all have @xmath76 consistent with c@xmath14 ) .",
    "there are 14 _ galex_-observed asteroids listed simply as x types in the tholen system ( presumably because no visible albedo was available at the time of classification ) ; figure 10 shows that these are in fact distributed across both the c@xmath14 and c@xmath13 albedo ranges .    in the bus / binzel system , the x complex consists of four subgroups :",
    "xc , xk , x and xe , these being differentiated by their spectral slope and presence of various absorption features . in the _ galex _ sample",
    "the most numerous of these are the xc types , which have the least red visible color and seem to include both high and low visible albedo members .",
    "both the xe and xk types have higher visible color indices ( with larger uncertainties in the color ) . as with the tholen",
    "x types , we see no systematic trends with respect to the nuv properties of these subgroups .      three _",
    "galex_-observed asteroids are categorized as g types . like g - type ceres , these have intermediate @xmath76 and an above - average @xmath123 .",
    "in contrast , however , the g - type @xmath124 lies slightly below the c - type average .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that all three g types in this sample have @xmath120 and so are formally classed as c@xmath14 objects , as a result their assumed @xmath125 in the computation of @xmath53 may be too low . on the other hand , @xcite fit @xmath126 to ceres phase function , suggesting that the assumed @xmath127 for c@xmath14 types ( table 2 ) is a more valid assumption for g types than the c@xmath13 value of @xmath128 . hence the g types seem not to fit well into either of our c@xmath14 or c@xmath13 groups , and hence are not accurately modeled by our @xmath53 .",
    "the three - asteroid g - type sample s higher than average @xmath111 agrees with the ceres _ hst _ data ( figure 9 ) , which as discussed above could be indicative of an absorption feature at @xmath4300 nm unique to g types @xcite , the precise shape and location of which remains unresolved in the broadband photometry considered here .",
    "tholen s g types are represented in the bus / binzel system by the cg and cgh groups ; however no asteroids in our _ galex _ sample have either of these smassii labels",
    ".      members of the tholen b and f classes , represented also by the bus / binzel b and cb classes , all are classified as c@xmath14 types in the _ galex _ sample based on their @xmath51 . unlike the g types , the b types are not anomalous in @xmath111 , meaning the b types likely lack the g types strong absorption at 300 nm .",
    "the b types also are characterized by slightly higher @xmath129 compared to the c@xmath14 average @xmath130 .",
    "hence , like the g types , the b types show a lower than average @xmath112 symptomatic of an underestimated @xmath30 and therefore too dim of a predicted @xmath53 .",
    "we present nuv - band photometry of 405 asteroids observed serendipitously by _ galex _ from 20032012 . using a compilation of visible - band color data , we select the subset of these _ galex_-observed asteroids belonging to the c - type or s - type classes .",

    "<S> we present ultraviolet photometry ( nuv band , 180280 nm ) of 405 asteroids observed serendipitously by the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) from 20032012 . all asteroids in this sample were detected by _ galex _ at least twice . </S>",
    "<S> unambiguous visible - color - based taxonomic labels ( c type versus s type ) exist for 315 of these asteroids ; of these , thermal - infrared - based diameters are available for 245 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive @xmath0 color using two independent models to predict the visual magnitude @xmath1 at each nuv - detection epoch . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath1 models produce @xmath0 distributions in which the s types are redder than c types with more than 8@xmath2 confidence . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the s types redder spectral slopes in the visible remain redder than the c types into the nuv , this redness being consistent with absorption by silica - containing rocks . </S>",
    "<S> the _ galex _ </S>",
    "<S> asteroid data confirm earlier results from the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ , which two decades ago produced the only other sizeable set of uv asteroid photometry . </S>",
    "<S> the _ galex_-derived @xmath0 data also agree with previously published _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) uv observations of asteroids 21 lutetia and 1 ceres . both the _ hst _ and _ galex _ data indicate that nuv band is less useful than @xmath3 band for distinguishing subgroups within the greater population of visible - color - defined c types ( notably , m types and g types ) . </S>"
