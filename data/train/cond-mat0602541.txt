    "many - particle effects in quantum tunneling through quantum dots are extensively discussed in the current literature ( see , e.g. , recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "single - electron tunneling under the conditions of strong coulomb blockade is accompanied by co - tunneling processes with spin - reversal , which involve dynamical screening effects similar to the celebrated kondo - scattering in magnetically doped metals .",
    "the pertinent effect was predicted and observed in single - well quantum dots with odd electron occupation , where the electrons confined in the well are represented by the non - compensated spin 1/2 of an electron on the highest occupied discrete level .",
    "this generic pattern may be enriched in many ways , in particular , by studying the tunneling through complex quantum dots containing two or three valleys .",
    "in this paper we are interested in specific physical properties of electron tunneling through complex quantum dots containing several potential valleys with essentially different capacitances .",
    "originally , the idea of coupling several nanoobjects having strong and weak coulomb interactions is formulated in the context of electron and spin structure of complex molecules ( e.g. , lantanocenes , containing strongly correlated f - electrons hybridized with weakly correlated molecular orbitals occupied by p - electrons ) .",
    "it is noticed @xcite that the energy difference between the singlet ( @xmath2 ) ground state and triplet ( @xmath3 ) excited state of a molecule with even number of electrons @xmath4 is anomalously small , so that the triplet excitation affects the magnetic response of the system .",
    "the simplest artificial analog of this system is an asymmetric double quantum dot ( composed of big and small dots ) with even occupation ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) and charging energies @xmath6 for small and big dots .",
    "when this double quantum dot is coupled with the metallic leads via the big dot ( the t - shaped geometry ) then lead - dot electron tunneling may induce an @xmath7 crossover @xcite : the energy @xmath8 of the triplet state becomes lower than the energy @xmath9 of the singlet state , and the kondo - regime may show up . in case of odd occupation @xmath1 ,",
    "the kondo - fano regime is relevant , where the kondo effect induced by an electron localized in the small side dot affects the electron tunneling through the weakly correlated big dot @xcite .",
    "if the leads are connected via the small dot , the big dot plays the role of additional reservoir for kondo screening in case of odd @xmath10 and the two - channel kondo effect may be realized under certain conditions.@xcite    the more complicated model of asymmetric triple quantum dot ( tqd ) with a small dot sandwiched between two big dots was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for odd and even occupations @xmath11 .",
    "it was shown that the kondo regime is accessible in both cases . moreover",
    ", the tqd with even occupation demonstrates @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "recently , a mirror symmetric tqd ( see figure [ tqd ] ) in an `` open '' regime ( near the coulomb blockade peak ) were studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in this case",
    "the big `` mesoscopic '' dot is connected with two small dots and with metallic reservoirs . as a result ,",
    "an indirect rkky exchange interaction between the spins in the couple of small dots occurs , and its sign may be controlled by changing the parameters of the large central dot by applying an external magnetic field .        here",
    "we focus on a mirror symmetric tqd in the `` closed '' regime , that is , the valley between coulomb blockade peaks where the total number of electrons in the tqd is fixed .",
    "our main results are : ( i ) in the cross geometry ( fig .",
    "[ tqd]a ) with electron occupation @xmath0 , such a dot possesses an unusual property : _ the indirect exchange tunneling constant between the big dot and the leads is ferromagnetic _ ; the kondo tunneling is therefore absent although the tqd behaves as a local moment ; ( ii ) in a `` fork '' configuration ( fig .",
    "[ tqd]b ) with electron occupation @xmath1 , tqd exhibits two different tunneling regimes : depending on the gate voltages , the kondo regime may be observed as a zero bias anomaly or as a finite bias anomaly in the tunnel conductance .",
    "the tqd in the cross geometry ( figure [ tqd]a ) is composed of left @xmath13 , center @xmath14 , and right @xmath15 dots , with corresponding levels and charging energies @xmath16 it is modeled by the anderson hamiltonian @xmath17 containing the terms describing the dot , two leads and the dot - lead tunneling , respectively .",
    "the first term is @xmath18 the parameters @xmath19 are chosen in such a way that for electron occupation @xmath0 , and in the absence of inter - dot tunneling ( @xmath20 ) , each dot is occupied by one electron . in the mirror - symmetric case such configuration is realizable provided @xmath21 at finite @xmath22 charge transfer from the central dot to the side dots is possible , but the double occupation of the side valleys is still suppressed by strong coulomb blockade @xmath23 . in the charge sector @xmath0 and for the mirror symmetric configuration the lowest energy states are two spin doublets , ( even and odd relative to the @xmath24 permutation ) , a spin quartet state , and a doubly degenerate charge transfer exciton ( with two electrons in the central dot ) .",

    "discussion of damping effects , which , to a certain degree , tend to smear the fba @xcite is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that it was shown in ref .",
    "that there exists a wide enough window of parameters , where this damping is not fatal for existence of well shaped fba .",
    "it is worth noting also that the tunnel conductance between the leads 1 and 2 exists in spite of the absence of direct tunneling channel .",
    "the tunneling mechanism is connected in this case with the `` pendulum '' structure of the electron wave function ( [ func2 ] ) in tqd . in case of ground state @xmath126",
    "this is the bonding combination @xmath206 , in case of ground state @xmath183 this is the resonating valence bond @xmath207 . in the latter case the dot 3 is excluded from cotunneling .",
    "it is therefore involved only in the determination of the kondo temperature .",
    "we have shown in this paper that triple quantum dots in some special geometries demonstrate unusual behavior in the kondo tunneling regime .",
    "this behavior stems from inequivalence of constituents ( side valleys and central valley ) .",
    "asymmetric double quantum dot considered in ref .",
    "was the first example of complex quantum dot with inner and outer `` shell '' .",
    "trimers with inequivalent side and central valleys studied in refs . and in the present paper are more complicated examples of artificial molecules with shell structure . in this case the two side dots form an `` inner shell '' whereas the big central dot plays the role of an `` outer shell '' .",
    "if the outer shell is open@xcite , it contributes to the indirect exchange between the electrons in the inner shell .",
    "we considered here the case of closed outer shell and found that such trimer with odd electron occupation @xmath208 possesses properties , which were observed earlier in dots with even occupation @xmath5 . in particular , the kondo tunneling may be absent in the ground spin doublet state of tqd due to special symmetry properties of the wave function ( odd @xmath70 symmetry in case of @xmath0 and empty outer shell in case of @xmath1 ) .",
    "involvement of the low - lying kondo - active spin doublet results in a two - stage kondo screening reminiscent of that found in quantum dot with occupation @xmath5 where the spin excitation spectrum is formed by the singlet - triplet pair.@xcite other interesting possibilities now open due to the resonance valence bond structure of the electron wave function ( [ func2 ] ) in case of partially occupied inner shell in a fork geometry with @xmath1 .",
    "in particular the `` pendulum effect''@xcite perceived in tqd with even occupation @xmath209 may be exploited in this type of tqd as well .",
    "the transformation of zba into fba under changing gate voltage is a special manifestation of general phenomenon , known as `` critical phase transition '' , where the symmetry of the ground state changes as a function of a control parameter .",
    "similar effect should be observed in planar and double quantum dots @xcite with even occupation where the singlet - triplet crossover may occur with changing gate voltage or in transition metal molecular complexes @xcite . in the latter case local phonons",
    "are essentially involved in this transition .",
