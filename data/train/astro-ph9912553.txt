    "the study of intensity and velocity variations in and above an active region is continuously refined with successively improved observational techniques .",
    "the intent of such studies is to understand the basic mechanism of the interaction of acoustic waves with the complex magnetic features .",
    "these investigations are carried out by measuring and quantifying the scattering properties viz .",
    "amplitude , frequency and phase of solar eigen - modes .",
    "there are two possible methods to carry out this study .",
    "the first method involves the relative study of the properties of solar surface waves travelling towards an active region and the wave that is reflected from it ( tarbell _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ; braun , duvall , jr . , and labonte , 1988 ; braun _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; bogdan _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; keppens , 1994 ; cally , 1995 ) .",
    "the other way can be a direct observation in and above an active region at photospheric and chromospheric layers respectively , which relates to the possible modulation of these acoustic waves along the magnetic flux tubes ( giovanelli and slaughter , 1978 ; lites , white , and packman , 1982 ; title _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; hindman and brown , 1998 ; balthasar _ et al .",
    "the investigations by both the methods have revealed a reduction in p - mode amplitude within active regions due to absorption of acoustic waves by magnetic structures .",
    "it is well established that the typical sunspots absorb as much as 40 - 50@xmath0 of the power of incident acoustic waves ( braun , duvall , jr . , and labonte , 1987 )",
    ". however , braun and duvall jr . (",
    "1990 ) observed power reduction of nearly 70@xmath0 in a large sunspot group ( noaa active region 5395 ) .",
    "there has been ample evidence towards significant deviations in peak frequency of the doppler velocity and intensity oscillations in sunspots at upper photospheric and chromospheric layers with the help of a lot of new measurements in different spectral lines and with improved observational techniques ( kentischer and mattig , 1995 and references therein ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the p - mode oscillations in sunspots at photospheric layers have been reported to be of 300s ( beckers and schultz , 1972 ; rice and gaizauskas , 1973 ; soltau , schroter , and wohl , 1976 ; livingston and mahaffey , 1981 ) and 310 sec ( bhatnagar , livingston , and harvey , 1972 ) , which is nearly same as that in the quiet photosphere .",
    "however , nye _",
    "et al . _ ( 1981 ) showed that the mean power spectrum of the umbral oscillations has several clear peaks , including a group of three peaks clustered around five minute period ( 260s , 300s and 350s ) and a peak at about 200s .",
    "similarly , horn , staude , and landgraf ( 1997 ) have shown that the spectra of velocity oscillations in the sunspot show features of strengthened power peaks in the bands of periods around 3 min and weakened in 5 min with respect to the quiet sun .    in this paper ,",
    "a time series of gong dopplergrams has been analysed to improve our present understanding of the influence of magnetic fields on the oscillation properties of acoustic waves near a sunspot .",
    "the gong instrument provides a spatial resolution of 8 arc - sec / pixel , which may be taken as a reasonable resolution for comparative study of p - mode oscillations in sunspot and quiet regions .",
    "the data used in this study consists of udaipur and big bear gong dopplergrams taken during 10 - 14 may 1997 . the gong instrument ( harvey _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) uses ni i 6768 angstrom spectral line to measure the global intensity and velocity variations in the solar photosphere .",
    "this instrument acquires full disk images of the sun on a 256x256 pixel ccd camera implying a spatial resolution of 8 arc - sec / pixel . in spite of this low spatial resolution and a constant parasitic stray light problem in the sunspot",
    ", the gong data can be reasonably used to investigate the influence of magnetic field on the propagation of p - modes by carrying out a comparative study in quiet and sunspot region .",
    "we have used once a minute gong dopplergrams of the observing interval on each day during 10 - 14 may to measure the velocity fluctuations in the sunspot ( noaa active region 8038 ) and quiet photosphere simultaneously on the solar disk . the observing interval along with the position of the sunspot in heliographic coordinates",
    "is given in table  1 .",
    "we have carried out this analysis for five continuous days , and also included data from two different stations , to enhance the statistical confidence .",
    "lccc station name & date & observing time & average sunspot location + & ( 1997 ) & ( ut ) & ( heliographic coordinates ) + udaipur & 10 may & 03:30 - 11:00 & n20e17 + & 11 may & 02:16 - 12:36 & n21e04 + & 12 may & 02:30 - 11:30 & n21w10 + & 13 may & 03:00 - 11:30 & n21w22 + & 14 may & 03:00 - 11:20 & n21w35 + big bear & 12 may & 15:00 - 20:20 & n21w16 + & 14 may & 15:00 - 23:20 & n21w41 +    the intensity and velocity images of the solar disk for 12 may taken at 05:13 ut from udaipur site are shown in figures  1 and 2 respectively . since a sunspot is not visible on the dopplergram , the corresponding intensity filtergrams have been used to locate the position of the sunspot on the solar disk . it is well known that dopplergrams in addition to p - modes also exhibit variety of features such as supergranulation pattern , meridional flows and solar rotation gradients .",
    "a two point backward difference filter ( grasp / iraf software package ) , @xmath2 is applied to the dopplergrams to enhance the p - mode oscillations above other features .",
    "the size of the sunspot under study is about 20 arc - sec , which is three times higher than the spatial resolution of gong instrument .",
    "the size of the sunspot remains nearly the same for the period under study , and hence it remains confined within a pixel matrix of 3x3 during its passage on the solar disk during 10 - 14 may .",
    "thus we chose a grid of 3x3 pixels for measuring the velocity fluctuations inside the sunspot in the time series of each individual day . on the other hand , three quiet photospheric regions ( q1 , q2 and q3 ) of equal grid size have been chosen at approximately the same limb distance to account for the effect of limb darkening , foreshortening and various other known effects .",
    "the selection of three quiet regions , instead of a single region on the opposite longitude , is carried out in view of ( i ) to increase the statistical confidence for a comparative study and ( ii ) to quantify the variation in the properties of acoustic modes in different locations of the quiet photosphere .",
    "the velocity fluctuations are measured for each pixel inside the grid as a function of time . in figure  3 , we illustrate these fluctuations for 12 may 1997 , udaipur station .",
    "this time series of each pixel is subjected to fourier transform to obtain the power spectrum .",
    "the power spectra from 9 pixels in the grid are then averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio as suggested earlier by kentischer and mattig ( 1995 ) . in this way",
    ", we obtain four average power spectra for each day as shown by dashed lines in figures  4 - 10",
    ". it may be noticed that the power in sunspot is appreciably reduced as compared to all the quiet regions while the power and frequency of p - modes in quiet regions do not vary with statistical significance .",
    "we notice that the power spectrum of acoustic modes in the quiet region follows an asymptotic lorentzian distribution as observed earlier by anderson _",
    "( 1990 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a significant departure from such a lorentzian profile can be seen in the sunspot power spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum of p - mode oscillations in sunspot shows distinctly several peaks around 5 min period in agreement to earlier investigations ( nye _ et al . _",
    "1981 ; horn , staude , and landgraf , 1997 ) which have been obtained using high resolution observations . based on the approach for modelling the solar oscillation spectra for global p - modes , anderson _",
    "( 1990 ) suggested that lorentzian fitting could be a suitable peak finding algorithm .",
    "however , in view of our sunspot results , the lorentzian fitting may not be the best peak finding technique . also with the aim of comparing the properties of p - mode oscillations between sunspot and quiet region ,",
    "we need to apply the same peak finding algorithm to both the regions .",
    "thus , to determine the genuine peak power and corresponding frequency of the power envelope , we applied a low pass digital filter , namely a savitzky - golay filter ( press _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , to the average power spectrum for both quiet and sunspot regions separately .",
    "this filter basically smooths the data by a window function of a predefined number of data points and a polynomial order with a proper weighting .",
    "after several experimental values of data points and polynomial orders , the optimal statistical fit is observed with a window of 32 data points and a polynomial of order 6 .",
    "we have then applied it to the average power spectrum for each day during 10 - 14 may to obtain the proper fitted power envelope as shown in figures  4 to 10 by solid lines .    lcccccccc date & @xmath3 & @xmath4 & @xmath5 & @xmath6 & @xmath7 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 + ( 1997 ) & ( 1e5 ) & ( mhz ) & ( 1e5 ) & ( mhz ) & ( 1e5 ) & ( mhz ) & ( 1e4 ) & ( mhz ) + udaipur data : & & & & & & & & + 10 may & 1.63 & 3.26 & 1.65 & 3.26 & 1.67 & 3.30 & 8.79 & 3.19 + 11 may & 1.86 & 3.26 & 1.90 & 3.29 & 1.89 & 3.26 & 11.27 & 3.18 + 12 may & 1.74 & 3.26 & 1.77 & 3.29 & 1.76 & 3.26 & 9.95 & 2.96 + 13 may & 1.63 & 3.25 & 1.68 & 3.28 & 1.65 & 3.28 & 9.28 & 3.09 + 14 may & 1.57 & 3.25 & 1.58 & 3.28 & 1.59 & 3.25 & 7.58 & 3.14 + big bear data : & & & & & & & & + 12 may & 1.03 & 3.26 & 1.04 & 3.32 & 1.05 & 3.26 & 6.39 & 3.07 + 14 may & 1.24 & 3.26 & 1.27 & 3.26 & 1.27 & 3.29 & 6.28 & 3.15 +    lcccccccc date & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath13 & @xmath14p & @xmath15 & @xmath15 + ( 1997 ) & ( 1e5 ) & ( mhz ) & ( 1e4 ) & ( mhz ) & ( @xmath1hz ) & ( @xmath0 ) & ( @xmath1hz ) & ( @xmath16 ) + udaipur data : & & & & & & & & + 10 may & 1.65 & 3.27 & 8.79 & 3.19 & 34.72 & 46.66 & 80 & @xmath172@xmath16 + 11 may & 1.88 & 3.27 & 11.27 & 3.18 & 26.88 & 40.15 & 90 & @xmath173@xmath16 + 12 may & 1.76 & 3.27 & 9.95 & 2.96 & 30.80 & 43.39 & 310 & @xmath1710@xmath16 + 13 may & 1.66 & 3.27 & 9.28 & 3.09 & 32.68 & 43.97 & 180 & @xmath175@xmath16 + 14 may & 1.58 & 3.26 & 7.58 & 3.14 & 33.33 & 52.01 & 120 & @xmath173@xmath16 + big bear data : & & & & & & & & + 12 may & 1.04 & 3.28 & 6.39 & 3.07 & 52.00 & 38.52 & 210 & @xmath174@xmath16 + 14 may & 1.26 & 3.27 & 6.28 & 3.15 & 33.33 & 50.13 & 120 & @xmath173@xmath16 +    the estimated peak power and the corresponding frequency in the quiet regions ( q1 , q2 @xmath18 q3 ) and sunspot are shown in table  2 for each individual day .",
    "based on the results listed in table  2 , we have calculated the variation in peak power and the corresponding frequency of the power envelopes for the three quiet regions .",
    "it is observed that the variation in power among q1 , q2 and q3 is within 5@xmath0 , whereas the variation in frequency remains within the frequency resolution limit ( @xmath13 ) of the power spectra .",
    "this implies that the variation in power and frequency of the power envelope in the different quiet regions is within the limits of one standard deviation .",
    "thus we conclude that the properties of p - modes do not vary significantly from one quiet region to other within the error limits .",
    "therefore , we have averaged the peak power and corresponding frequency of all the quiet regions , which is then compared with that of the sunspot .",
    "the peak power ( @xmath9 ) and the corresponding frequency ( @xmath10 ) in the sunspot with the average peak power ( @xmath11 ) and frequency ( @xmath12 ) in the quiet regions are given in table  3 .",
    "it is observed that the sunspot peak power is reduced ( @xmath14p ) by 39 - 52@xmath0 as compared to quiet region during its passage on the solar disk .",
    "it is interesting to note that the corresponding frequency of the power envelope in the sunspot deviates ( @xmath15 ) in the range of 80 - 310 @xmath1hz relative to the quiet region .",
    "the comparison of the power envelopes estimated by s - g filter for quiet and sunspot regions for udaipur station on 12 may is shown in figure  11 . the relative power reduction in the sunspot",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "a relative frequency shift of the power envelope in the sunspot is also noted .",
    "our results distinctly show the power reduction in the sunspot relative to a quiet region on each day in agreement to earlier investigations .",
    "however , the amount of relative reduction in power in the sunspot ( @xmath14p ) is found to be dependent on the location of the sunspot . during the period 10 - 13 may , when the sunspot is found within @xmath19@xmath20 to the central meridian ( table  1 ) ,",
    "@xmath14p varies around 43@xmath0 . on the other hand , on 14 may , when the sunspot moves",
    "further apart from the central meridian , @xmath14p is found to be significantly higher ; of the order of 52@xmath0 as illustrated in table 3 .",
    "our study also shows an apparent frequency deviation of the power envelope of acoustic modes in the sunspot as compared to quiet regions . this frequency deviation ( @xmath15 ) , as shown in table 3 , is also varying during 10 - 14 may , the lowest being on 10 may and the highest on 12 may .",
    "it may be noted from table  3 that the observed frequency deviation varies from 2 - 10@xmath16 , where 1@xmath16 is taken equivalent to the frequency resolution ( @xmath13 ) of the power spectrum .",
    "the frequency deviation of the power envelope ( @xmath15 ) is considered to be of statistical significance when @xmath15 @xmath21 3@xmath16 . following this",
    ", we find that only the deviation between 11 - 14 may is significant .",
    "as observed from the udaipur data , @xmath15 increases from 2@xmath16 on 10 may to 10@xmath16 on 12 may and then drops to 5@xmath16 and 3@xmath16 on 13 may and 14 may respectively .",
    "recently , jain _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) , based on the study of evolution of a sunspot region using soho magnetograms , have shown that the magnetic structure in this active region was rapidly varying .",
    "this conclusion was inferred from the growth and decay of emerging flux of both polarities close to the sunspot . as a ready reference",
    ", we show a sequence of few high resolution magnetograms of this active region taken from jain _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) in figure  12 .",
    "it is observed that two major opposite polarities were approaching towards each other since 10 may , resulting in the growth of the magnetic field gradient , so as to collide around 04:42 ut on 12 may leading to a long duration solar flare event ( 04:42 - 06:20 ut ) of 1b importance and an associated cme .",
    "we have calculated the daily variation in magnetic field gradient of this active region between 10 - 14 may and plotted it with the daily variation in peak frequency deviation in the sunspot ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "this plot shows a strong linear dependence of the frequency deviation on the magnetic field gradient and hence magnetic structure of the active region .",
    "this indicates the role of the magnetic field gradient on the frequency deviation of the peak power in the power envelope of the acoustic modes of the sunspot relative a quiet region .",
    "the extraordinary increase in @xmath15 , of the order of 310 @xmath1hz , on 12 may for udaipur station may be interpreted as the influence of the long duration solar flare in the course of observing sequence as detected earlier by jain and tripathy ( 1998 ) while investigating the chromospheric modes in solar flare using high resolution h@xmath22 filtergarms .",
    "however , we obtain a frequency shift of 210 @xmath1hz on 12 may from the big bear data comprising of a post flare time slot ( 15:00 - 20:00 ut ) , which can be understood by the simplification of the magnetic field structure as explained by jain _",
    "( 1999 ) . the frequency deviation obtained from big bear data on 14 may is consistent with that obtained from udaipur site on this day .",
    "we conclude that in addition to the magnetic field gradient , the high energy build - up processes in the solar flares influence the properties of p - modes in the sunspot as compared to the quiet region .",
    "we conjecture that the deviation of the peak frequency of power envelope of p - modes in the sunspot as compared to quiet region is either due to a power re - distribution so as to peak at nearby frequency , or it could be the frequency modulation of these acoustic modes along the magnetic flux tube underneath the sunspot .",
    "we are thankful to a. bhatnagar , r. muller , h. m. antia and p. venkatakrishnan for useful discussions and suggestions .",
    "we also wish to express our thanks to kiran jain for her help in the data analysis work .",
    "our sincere thanks to w. c. livingston for his critical comments and suggestions which improved the manuscript .",
    "this work utilizes data obtained by the global oscillation network group ( gong ) project , managed by the national solar observatory , a division of the national optical astronomy observatories , which is operated by aura , inc . under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "the data were acquired by instruments operated by the big bear solar observatory and udaipur solar observatory .",
