    "the straightforward generalization of the standard model through the inclusion of extra chiral generations of heavy leptons ( n , e ) and quarks ( u , d ) was studied in a number of papers @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the analysis of deviations from the standard model due to 4th generation contribution was carried out in terms of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters for 4th generation particles being much heavier than @xmath6 .",
    "the case of new light physics was investigated in @xcite , using modified @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters in order to take into account the effects of relatively light new particles .",
    "particle and astroparticle implications of the 4th generation neutrinos were studied in @xcite .",
    "a more thourough investigation of the properties of the 4th generation in the framework of gut models was carried out in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that unifying spins and charges in the framework of so(1,13 ) group one gets four families of leptons and quarks .",
    "possible manifestations of 4th generation particles at hadron colliders were studied in @xcite .",
    "the bounds on the existence of the 4th generation from the analysis of the electroweak data fit were obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , the dependence of z - resonance shape on the contribution of 4th generation and , in particular , on the location of the threshold of @xmath0 production was not considered in @xcite , because the results were obtained in the breit - wigner approximation .",
    "this approximation is valid for the thresholds of 4th generation particles production being far from @xmath6 . if the threshold location approaches @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , than one gets a fast worsening of the fit ( see fig . 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is due to the fact that the standard approach to the radiative corrections to the electroweak observables , used in @xcite , does not work in the presence of the heavy neutrino ( n ) with @xmath8 .",
    "after taylor expansion over @xmath9 the expression for the polarization operator tends to infinity for @xmath10 , because the point , at which the taylor expansion is performed , becomes the branch point of the polarization operator .    according to the results of @xcite",
    "the best fit corresponds to @xmath11 gev , that is why careful analysis of the region @xmath12 is undertaken in this paper .",
    "we study the dependence of the z - lineshape on the location of the threshold of @xmath0 production .",
    "we analyze the energy dependence of @xmath13 cross section near z - resonance and find that it exhibits a characteristic behavior near the threshold , a casp .",
    "the casp is caused by the square root ( @xmath14 ) , appearing in the contribution of 4th generation neutrino to the polarization operator of z - boson .",
    "the form of the casp is determined by the location of the threshold with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "then we compare the theoretical expression for the z - lineshape with the experimental data , presented in @xcite , using the zfitter @xcite in order to take into account the electromagnetic corrections , and find that the 4th generation is excluded at 95% c. l. for @xmath15 gev .",
    "this bound depends on the masses of the charged 4th generation particles and on the mass of the higgs . using the results of @xcite , we fix the mass of the charged lepton ( e ) and take into account that the splitting of quark masses and higgs mass are not independent .",
    "this leaves us with one free parameter  the splitting of quark masses , which we vary from 0 to 50 gev .",
    "this variation is the source of the theoretical uncertainty in the bound on n mass as well as the uncertainties of the input parameters of zfitter .",
    "note , that the @xmath16 for the z - lineshape with 4th generation is even better for certain region of mass values then the @xmath16 for the sm prediction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the general behaviour of the cross - sections near threshold . in section 3 the exact formulae for the contributions of 4th generation particles to the cross section of @xmath17",
    "are presented .",
    "we study the behavior of the @xmath18 cross section near the threshold of @xmath0 production in section 4 . using the result of section 3",
    "we compare our prediction for the z - lineshape in the presence of 4th generation with the experimental data in section 5 .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "let s consider the interaction of two particles a and b , which form some resonance r , which in its turn decays into a system of particles f ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the behavior of the cross section of this process near r - peak can be calculated in the general case , regardless of the exact form of interaction .",
    "we need only the partial width of particle r. the cross section near the resonance is described by the breit - wigner formula @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are mass and total width of r correspondingly , @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are spins of particles r , a and b correspondingly ."
