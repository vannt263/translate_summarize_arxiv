    "recently great attention is paid to both experimental and theoretical investigations of kinetic processes in nanostructures , in connection with possibility of ultra small size electronic devices fabrication .",
    "comparison between experimental results and theoretical models provide information about tunneling mechanisms in nanoscale junctions due to the presence of localized states @xcite .",
    "localized states formed by impurities at surface and interfaces of semiconductors lead to strong modification of local electronic structure and influence the behavior of tunneling characteristics due to on - site coulomb interaction of the sample and tip conduction electrons with charged localized states @xcite .",
    "most of the experiments are carried out with the help of scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy technique @xcite and theoretical calculations usually deals with green s functions formalism @xcite or ab - initio calculaions @xcite .",
    "it was predicted theoretically and proved experimentally that on - site coulomb repulsion of localized electrons leads to the changing of energy values considerably even for deep impurity levels @xcite .",
    "it was found that taking into account coulomb interaction of conduction electrons with non - equilibrium localized charges result in non - trivial behavior of tunneling characteristics in the case of stm metallic tip positioned above the impurity atom @xcite and also leads to formation of peculiarities in local tunneling conductivity analyzed apart from the impurity @xcite .",
    "but in all the previous calculation tunneling transfer rates considered as a constant values and influence of the impurity s non - equilibrium electron filling numbers on tunneling transfer amplitudes due to coulomb correlations was neglected @xcite . however , this effect is a problem of great interest because influence rate depends on the impurity type and solving of this problem gives an opportunity to initialize impurity type with the help of stm technique .",
    "another question of great interest is what effect dominates in tunneling contact : influence of coulomb interaction on - site or on hopping matrix elements .",
    "correct investigation of this problem shows the way for not only qualitative but also for quantitative theoretical analysis of experimentally measured local tunneling conductivity , but it is necessary to choose the correct starting approximation for each type of impurity atom depending on the localized state energy level position relative to the fermi level .",
    "previous works demonstrate that for localized states with energy deep below the fermi level hubbard - i model @xcite suites well and for localized states with energy in the vicinity of fermi level mean field mixed valence approximation @xcite can be applied .",
    "so in this work we present detailed investigation of local tunneling conductivity in vicinity of an impurity paying special attention to the tunneling transfer amplitude dependence from non - equilibrium electron filling numbers due to coulomb correlations . on - site",
    "coulomb interaction will be also taken into account in our model .",
    "development of theoretical description suggested in @xcite and based only on on - site coulomb interaction should clarify the role of tunneling transfer amplitudes modification due to the influence of impurity s non - equilibrium electron filling numbers in formation of peculiar features observed experimentally in local tunneling conductivity .",
    "we performed calculations for two extreme cases when tunneling takes place through the impurity state with deep energy level and shallow energy level .",
    "we applied modified mean field self - consistent approach for the impurity state with shallow energy level and in the case of impurity with deep energy level modified hubbard - i model was used .",
    "we also compared our results with the calculations based on non - modified models based only on on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "both approaches were analyzed with the use of the keldysh fomalism @xcite .",
    "we shall analyze tunneling between the semiconductor surface and metallic stm tip in the presence of coulomb interaction for impurities with deep and shallow energy levels in comparison with fermi level .",
    "special attention will be payed to the impurity atom non - equilibrium electron filling numbers influence on the values of tunneling transfer amplitudes .",
    "the standard model system semiconductor - impurity atom - metallic tip with constant tunneling transfer rates can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath0 :    @xmath1 @xmath2    indices @xmath3 and @xmath4 label the states in the left ( semiconductor ) and right ( tip ) lead , respectively .",
    "the index @xmath5 indicates that impurity electron operator is involved .",
    "@xmath6 is the on - site coulomb repulsion of localized electrons , @xmath7 , @xmath8 destroys impurity electron with spin @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 describes conduction electrons of continuous spectrum states in the leads of tunneling contact .",
    "@xmath11 describes tunneling transitions between the tunneling contact leads through the impurity state .",
    "@xmath12 corresponds to the electrons in the localized state formed by the impurity atom .",
    "we shall start from the case of impurity state with energy level situated deep below the fermi level . in the presence of coulomb interaction tunneling through deep impurity energy level can be described with the help of hubbard - i model @xcite(hamiltonian of this model has the form [ 1 ] ) .",
    "taking into account coulomb interaction in this model leads to formation of two well separated impurity energy levels @xmath13 and @xmath14 instead of one initial level @xmath13 .",
    "it is reasonable to use approximation in which the strongest interaction of the considered model - the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 - is included in @xmath15 .",
    "so we can write down expression for @xmath15 supposing tunneling transfer amplitudes to be independent from localized state non - equilibrium filling numbers :    @xmath16    using system of dyson equations one can get expression for impurity retarded green s function .    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "expression for local tunneling conductivity in the case of constant transfer amplitudes was found in @xcite and has the form :    @xmath20    if one wants now to analyze modification of tunneling transfer amplitudes due to the dependence from impurity s non - equilibrium electron filling numbers , it is necessary to rewrite part @xmath11 of the initial hamiltonian [ 1 ] which corresponds to tunneling transitions between the tunneling contact leads through the impurity state . due to coulomb repulsion energy level position depends on electron filling numbers . impurity energy increases with the increasing of filling numbers and it leads to the decreasing of tunneling amplitudes between tunneling contact leads through the impurity energy level .",
    "so higher energy level corresponds to the smaller value of tunneling transfer amplitude and tunneling amplitude now depends on electron presence or absence on the energy level .",
    "initial hamiltonian [ 1 ] can be rewritten in the following way :    @xmath21    where expressions for @xmath22 and @xmath23 have the form :    @xmath24    when impurity energy level is free from electrons tunneling transitions from semiconductor continuous spectrum states to stm tip through impurity atom are described by transfer amplitudes @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "if impurity energy level is occupied by electron with spin tunneling transitions between continuous spectrum states through impurity state can be described by tunneling transfer amplitudes @xmath27 and @xmath28 . due to this assumption",
    "initial hubbard-@xmath29 model @xcite can be modified and expression for retarded green s function will have the form :    @xmath30    in this case relaxation rates can be written in the following way @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "expression for local tunneling conductivity than will have the form :    @xmath33    calculating expression for @xmath34 requires solution of self - consistent system of equations .",
    "two of them are equations for @xmath35 , obtained from expression [ 6 ] , and three equations determine impurity atom non - equilibrium electron filling numbers :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are equilibrium filling numbers in the tunneling contact leads .    [ h ] , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "black line corresponds to the case when tunneling transfer amplitudes have constant values and only on - site coulomb interaction is taken into account @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "for all the figures parameters values @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the same.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    fig.1 shows tunneling conductivity as a function of applied bias voltage for impurity with energy level deep below fermi level .",
    "it means that relation between energy level value and energy level width due to the tunneling processes is large than unit .",
    "tunneling conductivity calculated with the use of non - modified model hubbard - i ( hamiltonian of this model has the form [ 1 ] ) is shown by the black line and results obtained with the use of modified model ( expression [ 5 ] for @xmath11 ) where dependence of tunneling transfer amplitudes from impurity non - equilibrium electron filling numbers is taken into account are depicted by the gray line .",
    "tunneling conductivity calculated above the impurity demonstrates resonant peaks when applied bias voltage is equal to the initial position of impurity energy level @xmath46 and when applied bias voltage is equal to the initial position of impurity energy level shifted on the value of coulomb potential @xmath47 both for taking ( fig .",
    "1 gray line ) and not taking into account dependence of tunneling transfer amplitudes from impurity non - equilibrium electron filling numbers ( fig .",
    "1 black line ) .",
    "modification of tunneling transfer amplitudes by non - equilibrium electron filling numbers results strongly in significant decreasing of resonant peaks amplitudes in comparison with the calculations performed with the use of hubbard - i model for constant values of tunneling transfer amplitudes ( fig .",
    "1 black line ) .",
    "resonant peculiarities also demonstrate considerable width changing . when tunneling transfer amplitudes modification is taken into account resonant peaks width increases in comparison with calculations performed with the use of non - modified hubbard-@xmath29 model .",
    "so one can clearly see that coulomb interaction influence on hopping matrix elements in addition to on - site coulomb interaction strongly modify local tunneling conductivity measured above impurity with energy deep below fermi level",
    ". taking into account both effects leads to significant amplitude and width corrections of peculiarities in modified conductivity .",
    "now let us analyze tunneling through the impurity state with energy level in the vicinity of fermi level .",
    "it means that relation between energy level value and energy level width due to the tunneling processes is about unit . in this case coulomb interaction effects accompanied by the assumption that non - equilibrium electron filling numbers modify tunneling transfer amplitudes can be described with the use of modified mean - field mixed valence approximation @xcite and",
    "consequently hamiltonian depends on average electron filling numbers .",
    "so one has to rewrite again part @xmath11 of the initial hamiltonian [ 1 ] in the form [ 5 ] .",
    "more over impurity energy level position depends on coulomb interaction of the non - equilibrium electron density .",
    "a new impurity energy level position is a result of initial energy level position shift on the value @xmath48 .",
    "non - equilibrium impurity atom filling numbers @xmath49 must satisfy self - consistency condition [ 8 ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are determined by expressions [ 5.1 ] and @xmath52 in the mean field approximation has the following form :    @xmath53    after determining new position of impurity energy level we can calculate expressions for @xmath34 from [ 9 ] and finally evaluate local tunneling conductivity for shallow impurity taking into account coulomb interaction effects and tunneling transfer amplitudes modification influenced by the impurity non - equilibrium electron filling numbers with the use of expression [ 7 ] .    , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "black line corresponds to the case when tunneling transfer amplitudes have constant values and only on - site coulomb interaction is taken into account @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "for all the figures parameters values @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the same.,width=264 ]    calculation results are presented on fig.2 .",
    "tunneling conductivity as a function of applied bias voltage demonstrates that taking into account modification of tunneling transfer amplitudes due to the influence of impurity s non - equilibrium electron filling numbers ( fig.2 gray line ) in addition to coulomb interaction leads to important changes in comparison with the case of constant tunneling rates and on - site coulomb interaction(fig.2 black line ) .",
    "decreasing of resonant peak width and a negligible decreasing of the tunneling conductivity amplitude takes place for modified self - consistent mean field approximation due to the influence of impurity s non - equilibrium electron filling numbers on tunneling transfer amplitudes and consequently on relaxation rates . describing tunneling through the impurity state with energy level in the vicinity of fermi level",
    "it is necessary to mention that width of peculiarities in tunneling conductivity is determined by the value of relaxation rates @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "continuous energy shift of the resonant peak to the higher values of applied bias voltage exists mostly due to on - site coulomb interaction of localized electrons ( @xmath59@xmath60@xmath61 ) and can be seen both for taking and not taking into account tunneling matrix elements modification .",
    "it is clearly evident that resonant peak shift for modified tunneling amplitudes is smaller than in the case of constant tunneling amplitudes also because of relaxation rates modification .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the role of tunneling transfer amplitudes modification caused by the shift of energy level with changing of non - equilibrium electron filling numbers in the presence of on - cite coulomb interaction in formation of anomalous features in local tunneling conductivity .",
    "the influence of this effect on local tunneling conductivity have been analyzed for different location of localized states energy relative to fermi level .",
    "we have studied two extreme cases when tunneling takes place through the impurity state with energy level position deep below fermi level and through impurity state with energy level in the vicinity of fermi level by means of modified hubbard - i model and modified self - consistent mixed valence mean field approximation correspondingly .    for impurity state with energy level deep below the fermi level modification of tunneling transfer amplitudes in addition to on - site coulomb interaction results in significant changing of resonant peaks amplitudes and width in comparison with non - modified hubbard - i model .",
    "resonant peculiarities demonstrate strong amplitudes decreasing .",
    "we also observed considerable increasing of resonant peculiarities width .",
    "impurity state with energy in the vicinity of fermi level also demonstrates significant changes in local tunneling conductivity in comparison with the case of constant tunneling rates due to modification of tunneling transfer amplitudes in addition to on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "we observed width changing of resonant peak , slight decreasing of the tunneling conductivity amplitude and smaller resonant peak shift to higher value of applied bias voltage .    obtained results give us possibility to conclude",
    "that on - site coulomb interaction strongly influence local tunneling conductivity measured in the vicinity of impurity atom and coulomb interaction influence on hopping matrix elements leads to corrections of peculiarities shape , amplitude and width in modified conductivity ."
