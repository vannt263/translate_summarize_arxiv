    "the canonical partition function of the dynamical triangulation model is defined as a sum over simplicial manifolds consisting of equilateral four - simplices glued together according to triangulations @xmath0 , @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the number of triangles in the simplicial manifold consisting of @xmath3 four - simplices and the topology is chosen to be that of @xmath4 .",
    "( for more details see @xcite . )",
    "we recall that the system has two phases , a crumpled phase at low @xmath5 and an elongated phase at high @xmath5 .",
    "the model is supposed to represent the quantum gravitational path integral over euclidean spacetimes weighted with the regge - einstein action , with volume @xmath6 and bare newton constant @xmath7 . as such it should be able to reproduce semiclassical einstein gravity as an effective theory .",
    "this can presumably be investigated using coordinate invariant correlation functions .",
    "another test is to see if scalar test particles form bound states , with appropriate binding energies under nonrelativistic conditions .    in @xcite",
    "we reported on such preliminary binding energy calculations .",
    "more insight was needed at that time about the spacetimes described by the model . for a semiclassical interpretation in terms of an effective action it is obviously important if there is in some sense a background spacetime which resembles the classical @xmath4 . to address this question we studied @xcite the number of simplices at geodesic distance @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "we found encouraging scaling of this function in a region around the transition between the crumpled and elongated phase .",
    "( for a different scaling analysis see @xcite . ) at the transition we observed that @xmath9 behaves approximately like a four - sphere , @xmath10 $ ] , for distances @xmath8 outside a short distance ` planckian regime ' up to intermediate distances of order @xmath11 . for larger distances fluctuations",
    "distort the shape of @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests that we focus our attention on this intermediate distance regime for a possible semiclassical interpretation of the data .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the number of four - simplices winding around a triangle @xmath13 ( often called a ` hinge ' ) .",
    "we measured correlations @xcite @xmath14 ^ 2 , \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where the brackets denote the average over simplicial configurations , @xmath15    with @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and similar for @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is a ` triangle geodesic distance ' between @xmath13 and @xmath19 .",
    "the ` disconnected part ' subtracted in ( [ e1 ] ) has the form of a correlation of the observable @xmath20 with the distance to a point @xmath19 , @xmath18 , which is itself a function of the geometry .",
    "this at first sight unfamiliar form is needed for the correlation to vanish at larger distances .",
    "other expressions for similar correlations are conceivable .",
    "for example , including a volume element @xmath21 with a summation over @xmath13 may appear more natural from the regge calculus point of view .",
    "we shall argue below that this leads to the same scaling results .",
    "taking the average @xmath22 separately in numerator and denominator is another option , which should not make significant difference for not too large distances , because of the self - averaging effect of the summations in ( [ e2 ] ) .    in regge calculus @xmath23",
    "is related to the scalar curvature @xmath24 , and @xmath12 to a local volume element at @xmath13 ; we write therefore @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , generally , in a scaling region , a lattice operator is expected to reduce to a combination of various continuum operators , weighted with powers of the lattice distance according to their dimensions .",
    "assuming that the theory can be described by a continuum metric tensor @xmath29 with corresponding curvature @xmath30 , the dominant continuum observable corresponding to both our lattice correlation functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 would be given by @xmath31@xmath32 ^ 2.\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is the geodesic distance between the points @xmath13 and @xmath19 for a given metric @xmath29 , and the average over geometries is supposed to be calculable in semiclassical fashion .",
    "of course , we do not know the effective action specifying this average",
    ". it could be a combination of @xmath34 and higher order terms like @xmath35 .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) separately for @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( crumpled phase ) , 1.22 ( transition ) and 1.50 ( elongated phase ) .",
    "the two contributions are very similar and fig .",

    "so the approximate @xmath4 background geometry is to be found in the region @xmath43 .",

    "a fit in the range @xmath46 gives @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the plot for @xmath26 looks similar and leads to a compatible power @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "the equality of the powers supports the argument given above that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dominated by the same operators in the scaling region .",
    "the power law behavior of the data may be expected for a flat spacetime background , with @xmath51 or @xmath52 for one- or two - graviton exange .",
    "the approximate @xmath4 interpretation of the spacetimes near the transition implies finite size corrections to the power law . an @xmath4 background curvature",
    "@xmath53 would also allow a behavior @xmath54 , by dimensional reasoning .",
    "we measured @xmath55 also in the elongated phase at @xmath56 , where the system is known to behave like a branched polymer with effective dimension @xmath57 .",
    "[ f4 ] shows , a power law looks better in this phase and a fit in the region @xmath58 leads to @xmath59 for @xmath25 and @xmath60 for @xmath26 .",
    "perhaps this can be interpreted in an effective conformal mode theory @xcite . in the crumpled phase",
    "the correlation data are difficult to analyse because the distances are rather short in this phase .",
    "we draw the optimistic conclusion from the power behavior that the correlation functions indicate the presence of massless excitations .",
    "the behaviour of test particles in the spacetimes generated with the dynamical triangulation model is another interesting subject .",
    "test particles have no backreaction on the geometry and a calculation of their attraction due to fluctuations is analogous to the quenched or valence approximation in lattice qcd .",

    "the approximate @xmath4 behavior mentioned in the introduction is now found in the region @xmath75 , with the distance definition emplyed here .",
    "we see roughly exponential behavior suggesting that the @xmath4 character of the background geometry can in a first approximation be neglected , similar to the correlation functions above .",
    "the corresponding renormalized masses are @xmath76 , 0.57 , 0.27 , 0.14 .",
    "the ratio @xmath77 appears to increase substantially as @xmath78 gets smaller .",
    "if the model describes semiclassical gravity we may expect hydrogen atom like behavior in a nonrelativistic situation , with small fine structure constant @xmath79 : @xmath80 in this way we may be able to define the renormalized newton constant @xmath81 . to get a rudimentary feeling for the corrections to ( [ e3 ] ) the hamiltonian @xmath82 may be useful .",
    "replacing @xmath83 and minimizing the energy leads to @xmath84 , which suggests that @xmath85 has to be considered ` large ' .",
    "clearly , there is no indication of nonrelativistic @xmath87 behavior .",
    "to judge the situation we have to make sure that @xmath88 is not too large ( assuming @xmath81 exists in the model ) , or @xmath68 too small for neglecting finite size @xmath4 corrections , or both .",
    "it is also desirable to get a semiclassical understanding of the quenched approximation .",
    "finally , we may have to take into consideration that the euclidean effective action at intermediate distances ( neglecting higher order terms like @xmath35 ) is unbounded .",
