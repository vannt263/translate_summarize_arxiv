    "the organizers of this section of the workshop are to be congratulated for their choice of data . without being overly complicated , the aneurisk65 data ( sangalli _ et al .",
    "_ , 2013 ) presents many non - trivial challenges for analysis .",
    "for example : the 65 angiographic images are misaligned due to the different placement of the patients with respect to the image - capturing device ; the images have different lengths , with the origin corresponding to a physiologically recognizable landmark but the endpoints being arbitrary ; and the main feature of interest , the syphon ( piccinelli _ et al . _ , 2011 ) , varies in shape and location from person to person .",
    "my analysis of the data was done on the curvature functions , not on the 3d images themselves ; this avoids the problem of rotating and translating the 3d curves to remove subject - placement artifacts , but does not remove the inherent variability in shape and location of the artery syphon , corresponding to the peaks around @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure fig : data_curves ( the variable @xmath2 is negative arc length in this parametrization , so the curves run backwards ) .",
    "the problem of unequal endpoints is also present whether we analyze the original 3d images or the one - dimensional curvature functions .",
    "my approach here is to treat the shorter curves as incomplete curves ( which they are ) .",
    "since the curves for patients with aneurysms at or after the terminal bifurcation of the internal carotid artery ( the upper  group ) rarely extend beyond @xmath3 ( i.e.  the data is _ not _ missing at random ) , we truncated the curves at @xmath3 in order to avoid artifacts .",
    "but many curves were shorter than this , so the problem of unequal endpoints persists ; we deal with this by introducing a model that can handle missing data , as explained below .",
    "let @xmath4 be the ( complete , unobserved ) curvature functions , @xmath5 with @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the data actually observed is of the form @xmath7for different grids @xmath8 and random errors @xmath9 ( the errors could be assumed to be zero because the curves were pre - smoothed , but the @xmath10s are still a useful slack variable to capture the random variation not explained by model ( [ eq : kl ] ) below ) .",
    "the variability in location of the syphon will be accounted for by the warping functions @xmath11 .",
    "we assume , then , that @xmath12where @xmath13 are functions  that , loosely speaking , possess only amplitude variability and can therefore be modeled with a parsimonious principal - component decomposition , @xmath14where the @xmath15s are orthonormal functions in @xmath16 and the @xmath17s are uncorrelated with decreasing variances .",
    "in fact , we will assume @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath21 the family of functions spanned by ( [ eq : kl ] ) , generally referred to as the templatein the warping literature .",
    "the @xmath15s , @xmath22s and @xmath23 will be estimated from the data ; we will assume @xmath23 and the @xmath15s are spline functions , thus reducing the estimation problem to a common multivariate problem : given e.g.  a b - spline basis @xmath24 , we assume @xmath25 and @xmath26 for parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 to be estimated from the data .    for the warping functions @xmath29 we also specify a family of functions @xmath30 that is parsimonious but flexible enough to accommodate phase variability at the salient features of the curves .",
    "the family of monotone interpolating hermite splines ( fritsch and carlson , 1980 ) is very convenient to work with . given a knot vector @xmath31 of locations on interest  ( for example , @xmath32 in our case ) and any @xmath33 with monotone increasing coordinates , there exists an @xmath34 such that @xmath35 ; this interpolating property provides all the warping flexibility we want at the features of interest , without increasing the dimension of @xmath36 unnecessarily .",
    "the monotonicity of hermite splines is very easy to enforce for _ any _ @xmath37s ; see fritsch and carlson ( 1980 ) .",
    "the individual @xmath37s could be either specified by the researcher ( as in landmark registration ) or treated as unobservable random effects , as we will do here . since the coordinates of the @xmath33s must be strictly increasing and fall within the range @xmath38 , it is more convenient to transform them into unconstrained vectors @xmath39 using e.g.  the jupp transform , and assume @xmath40 with @xmath41 the jupp transform of @xmath42 and @xmath43 a covariance matrix to be estimated from the data .",
    "therefore , our warping functions will be parameterized as @xmath44 for a fixed function @xmath45 that depends only on @xmath31 ( its exact form does not matter here ) .    a brief digression : the decomposition ( [ eq : decomp ] ) is clearly not unique ; given any @xmath46 and any arbitrary monotone function @xmath29",
    ", one can always define @xmath47 and then the decomposition @xmath48 trivially follows .",
    "so it does not make sense to talk about the  warping component @xmath29 and the  amplitude component @xmath49 for a given @xmath50 . nevertheless , for a _ given _",
    "template @xmath21 and a _ given _ warping family @xmath36 , the decomposition ( [ eq : decomp ] ) _ is _ identifiable ( except for the usual indeterminacy on the sign of the @xmath51s ) . but different combinations of templates and warping models can give rise to essentially equivalent fits .",
    "the usual example is the random shift : if @xmath52 , a simple taylor approximation yields @xmath53 , so the @xmath46s could be modeled by a one - amplitude - component model without warping just as well .",
    "therefore , when we talk about the  amplitude component and the  warping component in this paper , it is always in the context of a specific pair @xmath54 .",
    "going back to the original problem : putting together ( [ eq : raw - data ] ) , ( [ eq : decomp ] ) , @xmath21 and @xmath36 , and assuming the @xmath55s are i.i.d .",
    "@xmath56 , we obtain the following random - effects model for the raw data @xmath57 : @xmath58with @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 the @xmath61 matrix with elements @xmath62_{jl}=\\phi _ { l}\\{g^{-1}(t_{ij},% \\mathbf{\\theta } _ { i})\\}$ ] ( the inverse of @xmath63 is taken with respect to the variable @xmath2 for each @xmath39 . ) the model parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath43 and @xmath67 are estimated by maximum likelihood using the em algorithm .",
    "a drawback of this approach is that it was developed for sparse and irregular time grids , and it becomes infeasible for large @xmath68s ; therefore we down - sampled the curves so that @xmath69 for all @xmath70 .",
    "some high - definition features were lost , but the main peaks are still clearly visible in figure fig : data_curves .",
    "the random - effect approach to warping described in this section is still unpublished for univariate samples , but a similar approach in the context of functional regression is described in gervini ( 2012 ) , where the interested reader may find more technical details .",
    "we fitted several models with warping knots @xmath71 and different numbers of amplitude components @xmath72 ranging from 0 ( mean - only model ) to 5 .",
    "we used cubic b - splines with 10 equispaced knots for @xmath23 and the @xmath15s .",
    "the warped functions for @xmath73 are shown in figures [ fig : data_curves](b ) and [ fig : data_curves](d ) .",
    "plots of @xmath74 plus / minus @xmath75 and @xmath76 are shown in figure [ fig : pcs ] . the first principal component is mostly associated with amplitude variation at the syphon peaks , while the second component is mostly associated with amplitude variation at the origin .",
    "can they be used to discriminate patients with aneurysms at or after the terminal bifurcation of the internal carotid artery ( the upper  group ) from patients with no - aneurysms or with aneurysms along the carotid artery ( the lower  group ) ?    to answer this question we first tried logistic discrimination based on the registered curves @xmath13 . introducing a binary variable @xmath77 , with @xmath78 indicating the upper  group and",
    "@xmath79 the rest of the patients , the logistic model assumes that @xmath80   \\label{eq : logistic}\\]]for parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume @xmath83 , since in view of ( [ eq : kl ] ) the part of @xmath84 orthogonal to @xmath85 will also be orthogonal to @xmath86 .",
    "then we have @xmath87 and we can re - write ( [ eq : logistic ] ) as @xmath88which is just a common multivariate logistic model . the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 were estimated by conditional maximum likelihood , as usual .",
    "the crossvalidated misclassification rates for each @xmath72 are given in table [ tab : cmr ] ( first column ) .",
    "the lowest one is attained at @xmath91 , but in the interest of parsimony we choose the second - best , the two - component model , for which the misclassification rate is only slightly larger at 38.5% .",
    "this high misclassification rate is disappointing , and we wonder if the warping process may not contain additional information that could be useful for discrimination . an easy way to answer this question is to augment model ( [ eq : logistic_scores ] ) with the @xmath33s and assume that @xmath92estimating the parameters by conditional maximum likelihood as before , the crossvalidated misclassification rates we now obtain ( table [ tab : cmr ] , second column ) are considerably lower , in particular for the optimal two - component model , which is 24.6% .",
    "the parameter estimators are @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the sign of @xmath95 indicates that the probability of being in the upper  group decreases as the height of the peaks at @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath96 increases ( this is somewhat visible to the naked eye in figure [ fig : data_curves](b ) and [ fig : data_curves](d ) . )",
    "the signs of the last two coefficients of @xmath97 also indicate that for patients in the uppergroup the peaks at @xmath0 and @xmath1 tend to occur closer to the origin ; a caveat is that this could be an artifact of the image - capturing process and not a feature of artery shape , although the negative sign of @xmath98 seems to rule this out ( because , if the whole curve had been shifted , @xmath99 would also be positive ) .",
    "either way , this example shows that the warping process sometimes does contain useful information for classification and discrimination that should not be neglected .",
    ".crossvalidated misclassification rates for models with @xmath72 amplitude components , with and without warping parameters included in the model .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     there are a number of ways in which this analysis could be refined .",
    "for example , instead of the two - step process followed above , where estimation of amplitude principal components and warping functions is done separately from discrimination , both steps could be brought together by maximizing the likelihood of model ( [ eq : augmented_logistic ] ) instead of ( eq : normal_model ) .",
    "the principal components and warping functions thus obtained would have been optimized for discrimination and may yield lower misclassification rates than the two - step process ; the author is currently investigating this approach .",
    "the other important issue is the handling of incomplete curves .",
    "the approach in this analysis was to down - sample the curves and apply a likelihood - based method originally developed for sparsely sampled curves , but in doing so , the sharpest peaks of the curves are dulled or lost entirely ; that did not matter much for these data , but in other situations the impact may be significant .",
    "the existing registration methods that handle densely sampled curves usually involve functional inner products and norms that require computation of integrals over the whole range @xmath38 , which can not be done with incomplete curves ( not in an elegant way at least , i.e.  avoiding artificial truncations or extrapolations ) . finding a way around this problem would be an interesting contribution to the registration literature .",
