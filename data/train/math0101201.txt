    "what is important about is that is has degree @xmath278 in @xmath186 and @xmath279 and , hence , whatever contribution it makes to the asymptotics of , it will be in degree @xmath209 in @xmath280 and @xmath281 . since we are interested in terms of strictly positive degree in all variables , see section [ posdeg ] , the terms containing are negligible . by the same token ,",
    "any terms containing can be also discarded .",
    "it follows that relevant terms in the asymptotics are obtained by applying all operators @xmath251 to the @xmath9-function . from and",
    "the leibnitz rule we obtain @xmath282 where @xmath283 denotes the monomial symmetric function @xmath284 therefore , modulo irrelevant terms , the asymptotics of the integrand in is @xmath285 \\sim \\frac{1}{(-2\\pi",

    "now it remains to use the formulas @xmath286 and @xmath287 to obtain the expansion @xmath288 where dots stand for irrelevant terms , that is , for diagonal terms and terms of negative degree in the @xmath280 s , and @xmath289 is the coefficient in corresponding to the nonincreasing rearrangement of the numbers @xmath290 .    by and proposition [ gcr ] we have @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the connected part of @xmath83 and dots stand for diagonal terms .",
    "now and theorem [ t1 ] imply that @xmath293 where @xmath294 denotes the rescaled @xmath9-function @xmath295 circle stands for the connected part , and dots stand for terms of negative degree in @xmath54 , that is , for the @xmath187 terms in the case @xmath188 .",
