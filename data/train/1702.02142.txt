    "we believe that studying particular cases will lead to a better understanding of the problem and potential solutions .",

    "those families satisfy the condition that the graphs are maximal graphs with the property that the rank number of each graph equals the rank number of the base directed path .",
    "the graphs of the first two families described were constructed recursively by adding all admissible edges ( without increasing the number of vertices ) to a base directed path .",
    "the same idea is extended to directed cycles .",
    "we generalize the concept developed to build the first four families above to other maximal families of graphs preserving the rank number of the base directed path by adding admissible directed paths and directed cycles to a base directed path or directed cycle .",
    "the number of edges and the number of admissible edges of the graphs in the first four families are counted using known numerical sequences .",
    "we prove , using the recursive construction , that the maximum number of edges in some of those families of graphs is given by a stirling number of the second kind .    for those who are interested in computational matters , we provide algorithms , some of which",
