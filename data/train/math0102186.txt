    "we obtain a manifold @xmath3 as the quotient space @xmath17 . for a survey on the subject see buchstaber and panov  @xcite , where the construction of the manifold  @xmath3 is discussed in section  3.1 .",

    "points which are contained in the relative interior of a @xmath18-dimensional face have a @xmath19-dimensional isotropy group .",
    "in particular , the isotropy group of each vertex has dimension  @xmath4 .",
    "buchstaber suggested to study quotients of  @xmath3 by freely acting subgroups of  @xmath8 , see  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by associating a finite group to each facet of a finite - dimensional simplicial complex , the _ group of projectivities_. for strongly connected complexes the isomorphism class of the group does not depend on the facet chosen . in the next section",
    "we investigate the groups of projectivities of combinatorial manifolds .",
    "it turns out that , in order to determine the group of projectivities , it suffices to have combinatorial information about the fundamental group plus local combinatorial data .",
    "this result is then specialized to the case of simplicial spheres which arise as boundaries of convex polytopes .",
    "a polytope is simple if and only if the boundary of its dual is a simplicial sphere .",
    "hence we can apply our results on combinatorial manifolds to any simple polytope  @xmath5 . this way we obtain the desired result : @xmath24 if and only if each @xmath27-face of  @xmath5 has an even number of vertices .",
