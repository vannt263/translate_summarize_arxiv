    "the star collaboration at rhic has published rather extensive and precise data on @xmath2 last year  @xcite , and new precise mid - rapidity data from phenix have just appeared  @xcite .",
    "earlier measurements were reported by both phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite .",
    "data sets with even higher statistics and kinematic coverage are expected in the near future .",
    "typically , the data are presented at fixed rapidity of the charged lepton , which by convention is counted as positive in the forward direction of the polarized proton .",
    "it has long been recognized  @xcite that @xmath2 offers excellent sensitivity to the individual helicity parton distributions @xmath3 of the nucleon , where [ eq : polpdf ] f(x ,",

    "information on @xmath3 is also accessible in ( semi - inclusive ) deep - inelastic lepton scattering ( dis )  @xcite .",
    "the key advantages of @xmath0 boson production are that ( i ) it is characterized by momentum scales of the order of the @xmath0 mass which are much higher than those presently relevant in dis and hence deeper in the perturbative domain , ( ii ) it does not rely on the knowledge of hadronic fragmentation functions , thanks to its clean leptonic final state . in any case , information from the @xmath0 program at rhic is complementary to that from dis .    the main concept behind the rhic measurements can be easily summarized : for @xmath9 production , taking into consideration only the dominant @xmath10 subprocess , the spin - dependent cross section in the numerator of the asymmetry in eq .",

    ".  ( [ eq : w - lo ] ) strongly dominates .",

    "[ eq : w+lo ] here the distinction of the two contributions by considering backward or forward lepton scattering angles is less clear - cut than in the case of @xmath9 because of the reversal of the factors @xmath21 relative to  ( [ eq : w - lo ] ) , which always suppresses the dominant combination of parton distributions .",

    "this leads to an overall factor @xmath71 for the born cross section , so that [ d1w ] = ( 1-w ) , as we have anticipated in  ( [ eq : hadronicnlo ] ) . using the general vertex structure given in eq .",

    "we note that the cross sections for the reactions @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be obtained by simple `` crossing '' @xmath90 , or @xmath91 . again",

    "it can in fact be vetoed experimentally because it is characterized by two charged leptons that almost coalesce .",
    "we also note that the @xmath27 interference contribution does not produce any final - state singularities even for massless leptons .",
    "finally , for @xmath59 scattering , there are no virtual corrections at @xmath141 . to obtain the finite cross section for these partonic channels , one",

    "our final analytical nlo expressions for the processes @xmath142 , @xmath143 through @xmath0-boson exchange are presented in the appendix .",
    "we briefly summarize a few features of the result for the @xmath142 channel .",
    "first of all , it contains the usual distributions in @xmath144 , which dominate the cross section at @xmath145 . these multiply the born cross section : [ eq : distributionsnlo ] & & c_f , where the coefficients @xmath146 may be found from eq .",
    "( [ finalqqb ] ) in the appendix .",
    "the terms with `` plus '' distributions represent the well - known threshold logarithms for the process that arise when the incoming partons have just sufficient energy to produce the observed final state , so that any substantial gluon radiation is kinematically inhibited .",
    "the other terms in the nlo result have a more complicated structure .",
    "the integration of terms containing  ( [ s12prop ] ) gives rise to three different types of denominators .",
    "we write them by introducing the function p(z ) .",
    "we then encounter the terms [ eq : denominators ] p_ip(z_i)(i=1,2,3 ) , where [ zdef1 ] z_1=1 , z_2 = w , z_3 = .",
    "evidently , @xmath147 essentially just corresponds to the propagator in the born cross section .",
    "the other two propagators are similar and reduce to @xmath147 in the limit @xmath145 .",
    "in addition to the new propagators arising at nlo , we also find several logarithms of the propagator terms .",
    "the logarithms that occur are [ eq : logs1 ] & & ( ) , + & & ( ) , + & & ( ) . as seen in eq .",
    "( [ defkandz ] ) , they are accompanied by inverse tangent functions resulting from the imaginary parts of the arguments of the logarithms arising in phase space integration .",
    "all these terms are multiplied by simple functions of @xmath98 and @xmath99 and by one of the three types of propagators given above .",
    "the result for the channel @xmath148 does not contain threshold distributions but does have logarithms of the type in eq .",
    "( [ eq : logs1 ] ) ; see the appendix for further details .",

    "figure  [ figrhic ] shows our lo ( dashed ) and nlo ( solid ) results for the cross section @xmath153 for @xmath150 and @xmath151 production through intermediate @xmath0 bosons .",
    "we have integrated over @xmath154 in the charged lepton s rapidity .",

    "our adopted values for the @xmath0 mass and width are @xmath156  gev , @xmath157  gev ( later we will also use @xmath158  gev and @xmath159  gev for the @xmath22 boson ) .",
    "clearly , the nlo corrections are significant everywhere .",
    "they have moderate size below and around the jacobian peak at @xmath160 and become very large well above the peak .",
    "a close inspection of the results in fig .  [ figrhic ] reveals a hint of a `` shoulder '' in the nlo cross sections just above @xmath161 .",
    "this shoulder is a true feature of the nlo results .",
    "it comes about in two ways : first , the @xmath122 channel itself has non - trivial structure here .",
    "near @xmath161 , there is a complicated interplay between positive contributions by terms with distributions in @xmath144 ( `` plus distributions '' or @xmath162-function ) in eq .",
    "( [ finalqqb ] ) , and contributions by subleading terms in @xmath144 , among them the terms involving the functions @xmath163 and @xmath164 , which are negative around @xmath165 and become positive just below and above the jacobian peak .",
    "this means that the @xmath122 channel is sensitive to the exact mix of positive and negative contributions .",
    "secondly , the @xmath59 process makes a negative contribution below and around @xmath161 and then becomes positive .",
    "this intricate interplay of the various contributions is also the reason why the height of the peak is reduced at nlo as compared to lo .",
    "we note that for increasing energy @xmath166 the shoulder becomes even more pronounced and in fact quickly turns into a double - peaked structure at nlo ; see also  @xcite .",
    "this at first sight surprising feature is a manifestation of the well - established fact  @xcite that the region around the jacobian peak can not be controlled within a fixed - order calculation . among other things , it is sensitive to small transverse momenta @xmath167 of the intermediate @xmath0 boson .",
    "there are large double - logarithmic corrections to the @xmath167-distribution of @xmath0 bosons at low @xmath167 , which need to be taken into account to all orders if one wants to address this region  @xcite .",
    "such a resummation is incorporated in the rhicbos code  @xcite .",
    "these issues become relevant for precision determinations of the mass of the @xmath0 boson from the lepton s @xmath42 spectrum near the jacobian peak  @xcite .",
    "for rhic , they are not really relevant since , if one is interested in determining polarized parton distributions , there is no need to focus on the region around the jacobian peak .",
    "rather , it is advisable to integrate over a sizable range in @xmath42 , so that the jacobian peak region constitutes only a rather small part of the cross section , and to study the distribution of the charged lepton in rapidity .",
    "this is the strategy adopted by the rhic experiments .",
    "we will therefore consider only lepton rapidity distributions in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we plan to present a more detailed analysis of the region around the jacobian peak in future work .    in order to check the validity of our analytical results and their numerical evaluation , we have performed extensive comparisons to high - statistics runs of the nlo code che presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , both for the unpolarized and for the polarized case .",
    "we have found excellent agreement .",
    "a representative example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltasigma ] , where we show the spin - dependent cross sections for @xmath150 production at rhic , through @xmath20 boson exchange ( left ) and for the background channels , @xmath22-boson exchange and @xmath27 interference ( right ; the pure - photon channel does not contribute to the spin - dependent cross section ) . both our analytical ( solid lines ) and the che results ( histograms ) are shown .",
    "we have followed  @xcite to use the polarized parton distributions of  @xcite ( referred to as dssv08 ) and the unpolarized ones of  @xcite which were also the baseline set in the dssv08 global analysis .",
    "furthermore , the figure is for @xmath168 gev , and the transverse momentum of the observed charged lepton has been integrated over the range of @xmath169 gev . as in  @xcite we have chosen the renormalization and factorization scales as @xmath170 and assumed @xmath171 active quark flavors . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltasigma ] the error bars of the results shown for che correspond to numerical integration uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties in our new numerical calculation are smaller than the widths of the lines .",
    "since our results are largely analytical whereas the code of  @xcite is based on a standard monte - carlo integration with numerical cancelation of singularities , our new code produces the results shown in about two orders of magnitude less time .",
    "of course , monte - carlo based codes are more flexible in general , allowing the implementation of various additional kinematical cuts and observables if necessary .",
    "we now turn to the spin asymmetries @xmath15 which are the quantities of primary interest in rhic s @xmath0 physics program .",
    "figure  [ as_pm ] shows our nlo results at @xmath149  gev as functions of @xmath43 .",
    "the cross sections have been integrated over @xmath172  gev , as appropriate for comparison to the phenix data  @xcite .",
    "we have now used the new set of polarized parton distributions of ref .",
    "@xcite ( referred to as dssv14 ) .",
    "this set primarily contains updated information on the nucleon s spin - dependent gluon distribution , which is less relevant for weak boson production .",
    "however , it is also based on new results from inclusive and semi - inclusive lepton scattering  @xcite , so that it offers new information on the quark and antiquark helicity distributions as well .",
    "we use the unpolarized parton distributions of  @xcite .",
    "the solid lines in the figure show our results for charged - lepton production via @xmath0 decay for the scale choice @xmath173 , while the dotted and dot - dashed lines correspond to the choices @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "one can see that the scale dependence of the asymmetries is extremely weak , which is one of the reasons why @xmath0 boson production at rhic is an excellent and theoretically well - controlled probe of nucleon spin structure . in fig .",
    "[ as_pm ] we also investigate the impact of the `` background '' presented by @xmath22 and @xmath26 exchange .",
    "the dashed lines show the nlo results for the scale @xmath173 , now including the @xmath22 and photon contributions .",
    "as is known from previous studies  @xcite , the background channels dilute the spin asymmetries somewhat , which is mostly due to the increase of the unpolarized cross section in the denominator of the asymmetry .",
    "we note that the star experiment at rhic is able to identify and subtract this background , using data as well as monte - carlo estimates , so that the data can be directly compared to calculations based on only intermediate @xmath0 bosons . for comparisons to phenix data",
    ", the @xmath176 background needs to be included .",
    "figure  [ as_pm ] also shows the spin asymmetries for @xmath22 and @xmath26 exchange alone , in this case integrated over @xmath177 gev corresponding to conditions in star  @xcite .         using our new nlo code , we finally compare in fig .",
    "[ fig : star ] the results for various sets of spin - dependent parton distributions to the published star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite spin asymmetry data taken at @xmath149 gev .",
    "the star @xmath178 data have been presented for various @xmath43 , sampled over the range @xmath177 gev of lepton transverse momenta , and our theoretical results shown are adapted to these conditions .",
    "we note that for phenix the cut on transverse momentum is different , @xmath179 gev , and the asymmetry is for electrons or positrons and hence includes the contributions from photons and @xmath22 bosons , as we just discussed .",
    "these are , however , relatively small effects ( see fig .  [ as_pm ] ) , so we show the phenix data point along with our results and the star points . in view of the results shown in fig .",
    "[ as_pm ] the scale choice hardly matters ; we use @xmath180 .",
    "the sets of spin - dependent parton distributions we use are from  @xcite ( dssv08 and dssv14 ) , from  @xcite ( nnpdfpol1.1 ) , as well as the `` statistical '' parton distributions of  @xcite and a much earlier set  @xcite known as the `` grsv valence scenario '' . from the figure we draw the following observations :    * all sets describe the @xmath20 asymmetry data rather well .",
    "the main reason for this is that the spin asymmetry is largely driven by the polarized up quark distribution which is relatively well constrained by dis data and hence similar in all sets .",
    "* among the various sets , nnpdfpol1.1 is the only one for which the star data were already included in the analysis , constraining the light sea quark helicity distributions . as a result ,",
    "the data are quite well described by the set , especially when one includes the corresponding uncertainty estimates  @xcite that we do not show here .",
    "note , however , that information from semi - inclusive lepton scattering is not included in the nnpdfpol1.1 set .",
    "* at @xmath181 , the two dssv sets show @xmath9 asymmetries that are below the data .",
    "since the dssv14 set contains the latest information available from ( semi - inclusive ) dis , this hints at the interesting possibility of a tension between the dis and rhic data , the latter favoring a larger @xmath182 distribution ( see also the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "it has to be emphasized , however , that we do not display here any uncertainties for the dssv set ; as shown in  @xcite , the main dssv08 uncertainty band is such that it just about touches the lower end of the error bars of the data points . in this sense , it is premature to draw any conclusions regarding such a tension",
    ". clearly , it will be interesting to follow up on this issue in the context of a new global analysis , especially when additional experimental information becomes available .",
    "* in the framework of the statistical parton distributions , the helicity distributions are obtained along with the unpolarized ones and depend on only very few parameters to be determined from data .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : star ] ( and as discussed in  @xcite ) , the model describes the rhic data quite well .",
    "* the grsv valence scenario of  @xcite describes the @xmath9 asymmetry data strikingly well .",
    "the main distinctive features for this set are assumptions about the breaking of su(3 ) in the relations between nucleon spin structure and hyperon @xmath183-decays , and the ansatz  @xcite = at a low initial scale @xmath184 . since @xmath185 and @xmath186 are known to have opposite sign , the latter ansatz forces the ratio @xmath187 to be negative .",
    "this requirement , along with the condition @xmath188 imposed by the dis data and the assumptions about su(3)-breaking , is realized in this model by a fairly large positive @xmath189 distribution and a negative ( and even larger in absolute value ) @xmath190 one . evidently , the star data prefer such a sizable positive @xmath189 .",
    "we note that one of the sets of ref .",
    "@xcite has a similar @xmath189 distribution and hence describes the @xmath9 asymmetry data similarly well  @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether also the large negative @xmath190 of  @xcite is realized ; unfortunately , the @xmath190 contribution to the @xmath20 asymmetry is typically overwhelmed by the @xmath185 one .",
    "note that a negative @xmath190 pulls the @xmath20 asymmetry to more negative values ( see  ( [ eq : w+lo ] ) in the introduction ) , which may explain why the grsv valence scenario shows the most negative asymmetry of all the sets at @xmath181 .",
    "needless to say that the grsv valence scenario has not been confronted with the latest ( semi - inclusive ) dis data .",
    "comparisons of nlo results for @xmath2 for various sets of helicity parton distributions  @xcite to the star data  @xcite taken at @xmath149 gev and to the phenix mid - rapidity points for electrons / positrons with @xmath191  @xcite .",
    "the cut @xmath177 gev has been applied on the lepton s transverse momentum .",
