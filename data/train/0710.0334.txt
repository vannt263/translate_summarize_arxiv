    "recently in the context of gauge / gravity duality , there has been an intensive study of the phase diagram of @xmath0 large @xmath1 @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills theory with added fundamental degrees of freedom , by considering the ads - schwarzschild black hole background with added d7-brane probes @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of d7-brane probes in the black hole background : either they end before reaching the black hole horizon , since the @xmath3 wrapped by the d7-brane probe shrinks to zero as in @xcite , or they reach all the way to the black hole horizon . the first class of embeddings is usually called ` minkowski embeddings ' , while the second is referred to as ` black hole embeddings ' .",
    "the parameter which parametrizes different embeddings is the temperature normalized quark mass  @xmath4 , which may be given in terms of the asymptotic value  @xmath5 of the embedding coordinate at the ads horizon .",
    "the phase transition between both classes of embeddings is of first order .",
    "the analysis of the meson spectrum shows that this phase transition corresponds to a fundamental confinement / deconfinement transition at which the mesons melt .",
    "particular interest has arisen in the more involved structure of the phase diagram when a baryon chemical potential is present @xcite .",
    "it was argued that for non - vanishing baryon density , there are no embeddings of minkowski type , and all embeddings reach the black hole horizon .",
    "this is due to the fact that a finite baryon density generates strings in the dual supergravity picture which pull the brane towards the black hole .",
    "a chemical potential for these baryons corresponds to a vev @xmath6 for the time component of the gauge field on the brane . in the dual thermal @xmath2-gauge theory a baryon",
    "is composed of  @xmath1 quarks , such that the baryon density  @xmath7 can be directly translated into a quark density  @xmath8 .",
    "the thermodynamic dual quantity of the quark density is the quark chemical potential  @xmath9 . in the brane setup we use , the chemical potential is determined by the choice of quark density and by the embedding parameter  @xmath5 .",
    "very recently , however , it was found that for a vanishing baryon number density , there may indeed be minkowski embeddings if a constant vev @xmath6 is present , which does not depend on the holographic coordinate @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram found there is sketched in figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] . in the grey shaded region",
    ", the baryon density vanishes  ( @xmath10 ) but temperature , quark mass and chemical potential can be nonzero .",
    "this low temperature region only supports minkowski embeddings with the brane ending before reaching the horizon .",
    "in contrast , the unshaded region supports black hole embeddings with the branes ending on the black hole horizon . in this regime",
    "the baryon density does not vanish  ( @xmath11 ) . in this paper",
    "we exclusively explore the latter region . at the lower tip of the line separating  @xmath10 from  @xmath12 in figure  [",
    "fig : phasediagram ] , there exists also a small region of multivalued embeddings , which are thermodynamically unstable  @xcite .",
    "divided by the quark mass is plotted versus the temperature  @xmath13 divided by @xmath14 .",
    "two different regions are displayed : the shaded region with vanishing baryon density and the region above the transition line with finite baryon density , in which we work here .",
    "the multivalued region at the lower tip of the transition line is not resolved here .",
    "the curves are lines of equal baryon density parametrized by @xmath15 .",
    "the critical density  @xmath16 , at which the first order phase transition between two black hole phases disappears , is shown as short - dashed line close to the transition line .",
    "it virtually coincides with the short - dashed line for  @xmath17 . ]    in the black hole phase considered here , there is a fundamental phase transition between different black hole embeddings  @xcite .",
    "this is a first order transition , which occurs in a region of the phase diagram close to the separation line between the two regions with vanishing ( gray shaded ) and non - vanishing ( unshaded ) baryon density .",
    "this transition disappears above a critical value for the baryon density @xmath7 given by @xmath18    in this paper we make use of the methods developed in the context of ads / cft applied to hydrodynamics , for instance @xcite , in order to determine the spectral function at finite temperature and finite baryon density . for vanishing chemical potential , a similar analysis of the spectral functions",
    "has been performed in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the spectrum is discrete at large quark mass , or equivalently at low temperature . at low quark mass ,",
    "a quasiparticle structure is seen which displays the broadening decay width of the mesons . as the mass decreases or temperature rises ,",
    "the mesons are rendered unstable as the resonance frequencies develop imaginary parts .",
    "modes corresponding to such frequencies are called quasinormal .",
    "these excitations are then dissipated in the plasma .",
    " note that for this case , there are also lattice gauge theory results @xcite .    in this paper we study the differences in the spectral functions with and without chemical potential .",
    "relating our work to the phase diagram shown in  @xcite  ( and reproduced here in figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] ) , we here consider the region of black hole embeddings  ( unshaded region ) with nonvanishing quark density .",
    "we find that at low temperature to quark mass ratio , the spectrum is asymptotically discrete and coincides with the zero - temperature supersymmetric meson mass formula found in  @xcite , which in our coordinates reads @xmath19 in @xcite , @xmath20 denotes the asymptotic separation of the d3- and d7-branes and @xmath21 counts the nodes of the embedding fluctuations . here",
    "we are considering s - wave modes in the kaluza - klein expansion of the d7 brane probe wrapping @xmath3 , so the angular quantum number  @xmath22 is zero .",
    "we connect the structure of the spectra found to the phase diagram in figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] : the meson mass behavior described above occurs close to the minkowski region of the phase diagram , where temperature effects are subdominant .",
    "moreover , as a function of decreasing temperature to quark mass ratio , the quasiparticle peaks behave differently with and without finite quark density . as discussed in @xcite , at vanishing density  @xmath10 the peak maxima move towards smaller frequencies as a function of increasing quark mass . here",
    ", in the case of finite quark density , we observe a similar behavior at small quark mass .",
    "however , keeping the temperature fixed as we increase the quark mass further , the peaks turn around at a value @xmath23 and move to larger and larger frequencies as the associated mesons become more stable .",
    "note that a turning point behavior was also observed for vanishing quark density in the context of quasinormal modes for scalar modes of melting mesons  @xcite .",
    "our spectra also show that for given quark mass and temperature , lower @xmath21 meson excitations can be nearly stable in the plasma , while higher @xmath21 excitations remain unstable . at vanishing baryon density",
    ", the formation of resonance peaks for higher excitations has also been observed in  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the distinct behavior of resonance peaks in section  [ sec : vectorresults ] , including a comparison of the observed turning points at finite baryon density with previous results .",
    "we also calculate the quark diffusion constant @xmath24 and show that at finite density , it exhibits the first - order fundamental phase transition up to the critical density given by @xmath16 . for very large values of the density , the diffusion constant asymptotes to @xmath25 .",
    "this reflects the fact that in this case , the free quarks outnumber the quarks bound in mesons .    as a second point",
    "we consider the case of an isospin chemical potential , on which previous work in the holographic context has appeared in @xcite . in this case ,",
    "two coincident d7-brane probes are considered . in particular",
    "we extend the results of our previous paper @xcite , in which we calculated the retarded green function and diffusion coefficient at finite @xmath26 isospin chemical potential for the flat embedding @xmath27 . in this previous work we also restricted to the case of constant vev for the non - abelian gauge field @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the flavor and @xmath30 the lorentz index .",
    "this means that we chose @xmath28 to be independent of the @xmath31 radial direction .",
    "in this case we found a non - analytic frequency dependence of the green functions and the diffusion coefficient .",
    "here we extend this work to the case of non - vanishing quark mass , leading to non - trivial d7 embeddings , and to the case of radially varying gauge field component @xmath28 .",
    "we find that spectral functions quantitatively deviate from the baryonic background case .",
    "additionally , a splitting of quasi - particle resonances is observed , which depends on the magnitude of the chemical potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section  [ sec : setup ] ,",
    "we introduce the gravity background , field and brane configuration , used for the subsequent calculations .",
    "we also sketch the method to obtain retarded real - time correlators of thermal field theories from supergravity calculations . in section  [ sec : baryonmu ] we discuss the spectral functions and diffusion behavior of fundamental matter at finite baryon density .",
    "for matter with isospin chemical potential , the same analysis is carried out in section  [ sec : isospinmu ] .",
    "the results are briefly summarized in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider asymptotically @xmath32 space - time which arises as the near horizon limit of a stack of @xmath1 coincident d3-branes .",
    "more precisely , our background is an @xmath31 black hole , which is the geometry dual to a field theory at finite temperature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . we make use of the coordinates of @xcite to write this background in minkowski signature as @xmath33 with the metric @xmath34 of the unit @xmath35-sphere , where @xmath36",
    "here @xmath37 is the @xmath31 radius , @xmath38 is the string coupling constant , @xmath13 the temperature , @xmath1 the number of colors . in the following some equations may be written more conviniently in terms of the dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath39 , which covers a range from @xmath40 at the event horizon to @xmath41 , representing the boundary of @xmath31 space .",
    "into this ten - dimensional space - time we embed @xmath42 coinciding d7-branes , hosting flavor gauge fields @xmath43 .",
    "the embedding we choose lets the d7-branes extend in all directions of @xmath31 space and , in the limit @xmath44 , wraps an @xmath3 on the @xmath45 .",
    "it is convenient to write the d7-brane action in coordinates where @xmath46 with @xmath47 . from the viewpoint of ten dimensional cartesian @xmath48",
    ", @xmath49 is the angle between the subspace spanned by the 4,5,6,7-directions , into which the d7-branes extend perpendicular to the d3-branes , and the subspace spanned by the 8,9-directions , which are transverse to all branes .    due to the symmetries of this background , the embeddings depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath50 . defining @xmath51",
    ", the embeddings of the d7-branes are parametrized by the functions  @xmath52 .",
    "they describe the location of the d7-branes in @xmath53-directions . due to our choice of the gauge field fluctuations in the next subsection ,",
    "the remaining three - sphere in this metric will not play a prominent role .",
    "the metric induced on the d7-brane probe is then given by @xmath54 here and in what follows we use a prime to denote a derivative with respect to @xmath55 ( resp .",
    "to @xmath50 in dimensionless equations ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath56 denotes the square root of the determinant of the induced metric on the d7-brane , which is given by @xmath57    the table below gives an overview of the indices we use to refer to certain directions and subspaces .",
    "the background geometry described so far is dual to thermal @xmath58 supersymmetric @xmath2 yang - mills theory with @xmath42 additional @xmath59 hypermultiplets .",
    "these hypermultiplets arise from the lowest excitations of the strings stretching between the d7-branes and the background - generating d3-branes .",
    "the particles represented by the fundamental fields of the @xmath60 hypermultiplets model the quarks in our system .",
    "their mass @xmath61 is given by the asymptotic value of the separation of the d3- and d7-branes .",
    "in the coordinates used here we write @xcite @xmath62 where we introduced the dimensionless scaled quark mass @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to the parameters incorporated so far , we aim for a description of the system at finite chemical potential @xmath64 and baryon density @xmath7 . in field theory ,",
    "a chemical potential is given by a nondynamical time component of the gauge field .",
    "in the gravity dual , this is obtained by introducing a @xmath50-dependent gauge field component @xmath65 on the d7 brane probe .",
    "for now we consider a baryon chemical potential which is obtained from the @xmath66 subgroup of the flavor symmetry group .",
    "the sum over flavors then yields a factor of @xmath42 in front of the dbi  action written down below .    the value of the chemical potential @xmath64 in the dual field theory is then given by @xmath67 where we introduced the dimensionless quantity @xmath68 for convenience .",
    "we apply the same normalization to the gauge field and distinguish the dimensionful quantity @xmath69 from the dimensionless @xmath70 .",
    "the action for the probe branes embedding function and gauge fields on the branes is @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the induced metric on the brane , @xmath73 is the field strength tensor of the gauge fields on the brane and @xmath74 are the branes worldvolume coordinates .",
    "@xmath75 is the brane tension and the factor @xmath42 arises from the trace over the generators of the symmetry group under consideration . for finite baryon density , this factor will be different from that at finite isospin density .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the dynamics of this system of branes and gauge fields was analyzed in view of describing phase transitions at finite baryon density .",
    "here we use these results as a starting point which gives the background configuration of the brane embedding and the gauge field values at finite baryon density . to examine vector meson spectra",
    ", we will then investigate the dynamics of fluctuations in this gauge field background .    in the coordinates introduced above",
    ", the action @xmath76 for the embedding @xmath52 and the gauge fields field strength @xmath77 is obtained by inserting the induced metric and the field strength tensor into . as in @xcite",
    ", we get @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the field strength on the brane .",
