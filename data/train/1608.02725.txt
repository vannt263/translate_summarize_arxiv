    "the concept of quantitative operator @xmath0-theory was first introduced in @xcite and was set - up in full generality for filtered @xmath1-algebras in @xcite .",

    "we establish an algorithm for computing @xmath0-theory of @xmath1-algebras with finite asymptotic nuclear decomposition . as a consequence , we prove the knneth formula for @xmath1-algebras in this class .",
    "the key idea is that the finite asymptotic nuclear decomposition for a @xmath1-algebra would allow us to compute quantitative @xmath0-theory for the @xmath1-algebra at each scale and the @xmath0-theory of the @xmath1-algebra can then be computed by letting the scale go to infinity .",
    "the main technical tool to compute quantitative @xmath0-theory is controlled mayer - vietoris pairs and attached controlled six term exact sequences .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1 , we give from @xcite an overview of quantitative @xmath0-theory . in section 2",
    "we introduce the concept of a controlled mayer - vietoris pair .",

    "@xmath3 is stated for a controlled mayer - vietoris pair the controlled six term exact sequence .",
    "we apply this sequence to @xmath0-contractibility of @xmath2-algebra .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the quantitative knneth formula , which implies the knneth formula in @xmath0-theory .",
    "we show that examples of filtered @xmath2-algebras for which the quantitative knneth formula holds are provided by crossed product of @xmath2-algebras by finitely generated groups satisfying the baum - connes conjecture with coefficients .",
    "the main result of these section in that the quantitative knneth formula is stable under decomposition by controlled mayer - vietoris pair . in section 5",
    "we introduce the class of @xmath1-algebras with finite asymptotic nuclear decomposition .",
    "this class is the class of filtered @xmath2-algebras @xmath4 for which there exists a integer @xmath5 such that at every order @xmath6 , the @xmath2-algebra @xmath4 decomposes in @xmath5 steps under controlled mayer - vietoris into @xmath2-algebras in the bootstrap category .",

    ", quantitative @xmath0-theory is the abelian groups of @xmath0-theory elements at each given scale and @xmath0-theory can be obtained as an inductive limit of quantitative @xmath0-groups ( see corollary [ cor - limit - quant - k - groups ] ) .",
