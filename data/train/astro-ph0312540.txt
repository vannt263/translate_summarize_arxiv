    "in many astrophysical situations a problem arises to predict or interpret results of measurements of the total ( combined ) luminosity of a population of discrete sources . among many examples",
    "are the total luminosity of x - ray binaries in a galaxy , or total flux of background sources detected above the sensitivity limit inside the field of view of a telescope .    in the following discussion",
    "we will use high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) in star forming galaxies as an example . as was shown by @xcite",
    ", the luminosity distribution of hmxb sources in a galaxy is described to first approximation by a  universal ",
    "luminosity function whose shape is the same in all galaxies and whose normalization is proportional to the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the parent galaxy : @xmath17 in a broad luminosity range , @xmath18 , the shape of the hmxb `` universal '' luminosity function is close to a power law , @xmath19 , with the slope of @xmath20 .",
    "importantly , the luminosity of the compact sources in star forming galaxies appears to be restricted by a maximum value of @xmath21 erg / s .",
    "this cut - off luminosity can be defined , for example , by the eddington luminosity limit for the most massive objects associated with the star forming regions .",
    "obviously , on the faint side , the luminosity distribution eq.([eq : xlf ] ) must become flatter or have a cut - off as well , in order to keep the total number of sources finite .",
    "this low luminosity cut - off may be caused for example by the propeller effect @xcite as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the expectation value for the total number of sources in a galaxy equals @xmath22 and , naturally , is directly proportional to its star formation rate .",
    "the number of sources actually observed in a given galaxy obeys poisson distribution @xmath23 with @xmath24 defined by eq.([eq : nmean ] ) .",
    "apart from effects of counting statistics , the number of hmxb sources found in an arbitrarily chosen galaxy will be close to the above expectation value .",
    "the problem , considered in this paper , is the behavior of the total luminosity of high mass x - ray binaries in a galaxy @xmath25 as a function of its star formation rate .",
    "an apparently obvious expression for the @xmath3 can be obtained integrating the luminosity distribution ( [ eq : xlf ] ) : @xmath26 hence , one might expect that the total x - ray luminosity of hmxb sources is also directly proportional to the star formation rate of the host galaxy , as is the total number of sources .",
    "this problem , however , involves some subtleties related to the statistical properties of the power law distribution of the sources over luminosity , which appear not to have been recognized previously , at least in astrophysical context ( a somewhat related problem has been considered by @xcite in connection with estimating the coalescence rate for the ns ",
    "ns binaries in the galaxy ) .",
    "although eq.([eq : ltot_mean ] ) correctly predicts _ the average x - ray luminosity computed for a large number of galaxies _ with similar values of star formation rate , it fails to describe the relation between _ the most probable value of x - ray luminosity of an arbitrarily chosen galaxy _ and its sfr .",
    "the main surprise of the study presented here is that , in the low sfr regime , the relation between sfr of the host galaxy and the total luminosity of its hmxbs is non - linear  with increase of the star formation rate the luminosity appears to grow faster than linear .",
    "the relation becomes linear only for sufficiently high star formation rates , when the total number of objects with a luminosity close to the maximum possible value , defined by @xmath27 , becomes sufficiently large .",
    "this can be illustrated by the following simple consideration .",
    "for an arbitrarily chosen galaxy , the brightest source is most likely going to have a luminosity @xmath28 defined by the condition galaxies . ]",
    "@xmath29 for a power law luminosity distribution with slope @xmath30 and with a cut - off at @xmath27 , eq.([eq : xlf ] ) , the above expression yields : @xmath31    as might be intuitively expected , at low sfr , the most probable luminosity of the brightest source increases with sfr , until it reaches the maximum value of @xmath27 .",
    "the threshold value of the star formation rate , separating low and high sfr regimes , is defined by the condition @xmath32 , i.e. that there are @xmath33few sources expected , with luminosity close to the cut - off value @xmath27 .",
    "the most probable value of the total luminosity , @xmath34 can be then computed integrating the luminosity function from @xmath35 to @xmath28 : @xmath36 which , for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , leads to @xmath39 i.e. is non - linear in the low sfr regime and becomes linear only at high star formation rates .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood as follows . for a slope of the luminosity distribution @xmath37",
    ", the total luminosity of a galaxy is defined by the brightest sources .",
    "the non - linear behavior in the low - sfr limit is caused by the fact that an increase of the sfr leads to non - linear increase of the luminosity of the brightest sources .",
    "therefore their total luminosity grows faster than the star formation rate .",
    "this non - linear growth continues until the maximum possible value of the luminosity of the compact sources is achieved .",
    "further increase of the star formation rate leads to a linear increase of the number of the brightest sources in the galaxy , but not of their individual luminosities .",
    "consequently , the @xmath12sfr relation becomes linear .",
    "in the more formal language of statistics such a behavior is related to the properties of the probability distribution of the collective luminosity @xmath40 .",
    "in particular , it can be understood in terms of the difference between the expectation mean and the mode of the probability distribution .",
    "the expectation mean is defined as @xmath41 and is given by eq.([eq : ltot_mean ] ) .",
    "the mode of the statistical distribution , @xmath34 , is defined as the value of the random variable ( @xmath3 in our case ) at which the probability distribution @xmath40 reaches its maximum value . whereas the expectation mean @xmath42 describes the result of averaging of the x - ray luminosities of many galaxies having similar values of sfr , it is the mode of the @xmath40 distribution that predicts the most probable value of the total luminosity of a randomly chosen galaxy .",
    "the non - linear behavior in the low sfr regime is caused by the skewness of the probability distribution @xmath40 resulting in a difference between expectation mean and mode . in the high sfr limit ,",
    "the @xmath40 distribution asymptotically approaches the gaussian distribution , in accord with the central limit theorem .",
    "the boundary value of sfr , separating the non - linear and linear regimes of the @xmath12sfr relation is defined by the parameters of the luminosity function .",
    "interestingly , the fact of the existence of a linear regime in the @xmath43sfr relation is a direct consequence of the cut - off in the luminosity function . only in the presence of a maximum possible luminosity for the sources , @xmath27 , ( for instance eddington limit for a neutron star ) a linear regime can exist , when the total luminosity of a galaxy is defined by a sufficiently large number of bright sources near @xmath27 , and any subsequent increase of the star formation rate results in linear growth of the total luminosity .    in the above discussion , we used high mass x - ray binary populations in star forming galaxies as an example . obviously , the effect considered in this paper is of a broader general interest and is at work in many situations related to computing / measuring integrated luminosity of a finite number of discrete sources .",
    "one example related to the application of stellar synthesis models to observations of stellar clusters has been independently discovered by @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : ltot_section ] we consider the statistical properties of the total luminosity , in particular in section [ sec : probdist ] derive the formulae for the probability distribution @xmath40 , using two different approaches , and present results of numerical calculations in [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the variability of the total emission is studied in section [ sec : variability ] . in section [ sec : applications ] we discuss astrophysical applications , including the properties of the total x - ray emission of a galaxy due to its population of high- ( section [ sec : hmxb ] , [ sec : imbh ] ) and low- ( section [ sec : lmxb ] ) mass x - ray binaries .",
    "our results are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] . in the appendixes we derive convenient approximations for @xmath34 and fractional @xmath44 of the total emission and",
    "consider their asymptotical behaviour .",
    "a casual reader , not interested in the mathematical aspects of the problem , can skip section [ sec : probdist ] and proceed with section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "we consider a population of sources with a luminosity function ( lf ) : @xmath45 the expectation values for the total number of sources and the total luminosity are : @xmath46 @xmath47 it is assumed that both quantities are well defined and finite .",
    "below we present two methods of computing the probability distribution of the total luminosity .",
    "the second of these two methods is somewhat more convenient computationally .      to compute the probability distribution for the total luminosity , @xmath40",
    ", we divide the @xmath48 luminosity range into intervals of infinitesimal width @xmath49 and express the combined luminosity of all sources as a sum @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the combined luminosity of the sources in the @xmath52-th interval , running from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the number of sources in the interval ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) obeys a poisson distribution with mean @xmath55 for @xmath56 , it is sufficient to consider the occurrence of either zero or one source per interval whose probabilities are , respectively : @xmath57 the probability distribution for the combined luminosity of the sources in the @xmath52-th interval is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the delta function . the characteristic function of this distribution is @xmath60 using the convolution theorem , the characteristic function of the probability distribution of the total luminosity can be computed as a product of characteristic functions of @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 finally , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is given by eq.([eq : ntot ] ) .",
    "the probability distribution of the total number of sources follows a poisson distribution @xmath66 with mean @xmath24 given by eq.([eq : ntot ] ) .",
    "the probability distribution of the total luminosity is : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the probability distribution of the total luminosity of exactly @xmath2 sources . in the majority of practically interesting cases , the total number of sources is sufficiently large , @xmath69 , and the poisson distribution in eq.([eq : pltot_pnltot ] ) can be replaced by the delta - function @xmath70 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is given by eq.([eq : ntot ] )    the probability distribution of the sum of @xmath2 random variables , @xmath73 , can be calculated using the convolution theorem : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the probability distribution for the luminosity of one source , which equals the luminosity function with appropriate normalization : @xmath76    the probability distribution @xmath68 , defined by eq.([eq : pn_ltot ] ) , describes the case when @xmath2 sources are _",
    "observed_. on the contrary , the distribution @xmath40 , defined by eq.([eq : p_ltot ] ) , is parametrized via the normalization of the luminosity function or , equivalently , via the expectation value @xmath77 , and describes the case when @xmath77 sources are _ expected_.",
    "these two distributions are related via eq.([eq : pltot_pnltot ] ) . for @xmath78 , which is often the case , they are nearly identical , and it can be assumed that @xmath72 and both quantities are related to the normalization of the luminosity function via eq.([eq : ntot ] ) .      to illustrate the behaviour of the total luminosity we assume a power law luminosity function : @xmath79      the probability distributions @xmath68 for various values of the slope @xmath30 and the number of sources @xmath2 are shown in fig.[fig : probdist ] . to facilitate",
    "the comparison of distributions for different values of @xmath2 , the abscissa in these plots is the average luminosity @xmath81 .",
    "the values of the luminosity cut - offs were fixed at @xmath82 and @xmath83    the skewness of the probability distribution @xmath68 leads to a deviation of its mode @xmath34 ( the most probable value of the total luminosity ) from the expectation mean @xmath42 indicated in each panel by the vertical dashed line . the effect is most pronounced for @xmath84 , is unimportant for for shallow luminosity functions with @xmath85 and gradually diminishes with increasing @xmath30 at @xmath86 .    for illustration",
    ", we also show in fig.[fig : probdist ] the probability distributions for a flat lf , @xmath87 , in which case @xmath34 exactly equals @xmath42 . naturally , for any value of @xmath30 the @xmath88 gaussian distribution in the limit of @xmath89 , in accord with the central limit theorem .",
    "correspondingly @xmath90 in this limit",
    ".      the dependence of the most probable value of the total luminosity @xmath34 on the total number of sources @xmath2 for different values of @xmath30 and the ratio @xmath91 is shown in fig.[fig : lprobn ] and [ fig : lprob ] .",
    "convenient analytical approximations for the @xmath92 relation are derived in appendix [ sec : lprob_approx ] and its asymptotical behavior is considered in appendix [ sec : asympt ] .",
    "the @xmath92 relation is significantly non - linear for `` small '' number of sources or , equivalently , for small values of the lf normalization @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , the boundary between the non - linear and linear regimes , expressed in terms of the normalization @xmath93 , depends only on the lf slope @xmath30 and its high luminosity cut - off @xmath96 ( see appendix [ sec : asympt ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the behavior of @xmath34 is defined by the number of sources near the high luminosity cut - off of the luminosity function , rather than by the total number of sources in the entire @xmath48 luminosity range , i.e. the condition for the linear regime is : @xmath97 the total number of sources in the @xmath48 luminosity range , on the contrary , is defined by the low luminosity cut - off @xmath98 ( for @xmath95 ) . for sufficiently large @xmath91",
    ", the non - linear regime can occur for an arbitrarily large total number of sources ( cf . the curves corresponding to different values of @xmath91 in fig.[fig : lprobn ] ) .",
    "interestingly , for the lf slope in the range of @xmath99 , where the effect is strongest , there is a relatively sharp break separating the non - linear part of the dependence from the linear part .",

    "consequently , the average of @xmath3 over a large number of realizations with the same @xmath2 always equals @xmath100 .",
    "this equality is achieved due to the existence of outliers , having values of @xmath3 significantly exceeding both @xmath102 and @xmath42 , in accordance with the skewness of the probability distribution @xmath68 for small @xmath2 .",

    "both quantities can be determined from the conventional indicators , such as radio or near - infrared luminosities .    of course with the sub - arcsec angular resolution of chandra the luminosity distribution of point sources in nearby galaxies can be studied directly . however , for more distant galaxies , d@xmath121 mpc , even chandra resolution becomes insufficient and only the total luminosity of the galaxy can be measured .",
    "provided that the contaminating contribution of the emission of a central agn and/or of hot x - ray emitting gas can be constrained or separated , one can study the relation between the total luminosity @xmath43 of a ( unresolved ) galaxy and its star formation rate or stellar mass .",
    "the @xmath12sfr or @xmath13 `` growth curves '' constructed for large samples of galaxies and spanning a broad range of sfr and @xmath122 can be used to constrain the xlf parameters of x - ray binaries in distant galaxies including those located at intermediate and high redshifts . with this",
    ", one can study the influence of a number of factors such as effects of binary evolution , metallicity , regimes of star formation , etc .",
    "on the luminosity distribution of x - ray binaries .",
    "the slope of the `` universal '' luminosity function of hmxbs , @xmath123 , is in the range where the non - linear behavior of the @xmath118 relation is most pronounced . in the left panel of fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] we plot the probability distribution of the total luminosity @xmath40 , computed for different values of the star formation rate .",
    "the distribution is strongly asymmetric in the non - linear low - sfr regime which , for the parameters of the `` universal '' hmxb xlf , corresponds to the formation rate of massive stars below sfr@xmath14 m@xmath124/yr .",

    "the data shown in fig.[fig : lx - sfr ] are from @xcite , complemented with the local galaxies data from @xcite . in plotting the latter we removed the duplications and the galaxies likely to be contaminated by the contribution of low mass x - ray binaries , unrelated to the current star formation activity , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the luminosities and star formation rates for the hubble deep field north galaxies @xcite were computed for the following cosmological parameters : @xmath131 km / s / mpc , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , as described in @xcite .",

    "the average of the measured values of @xmath3 will be equal to the expectation mean given by eq.([eq : ltot_mean ] ) and shown by the dashed straight lines in the left and right panels .",
    "due to the properties of @xmath40 these two quantities are not identical in the low - sfr limit when the total luminosity is defined by the small number of the most luminous sources . only in the large sfr limit when there are sufficiently many sources with luminosities near the cut - off of the luminosity function , @xmath135 , does the @xmath12sfr relation behave in the intuitively expected way .    owing to the skewness of the probability distribution @xmath40 large and asymmetric dispersion among the measured values of @xmath134",
    "is expected in the non - linear low - sfr regime .",

    "such behavior differs from a typical astrophysical situation and should not be ignored when analyzing and fitting the @xmath43sfr relation in the low sfr regime . in particular , due to non - gaussianity of the @xmath40 distribution the standard data analysis techniques ",
    "least square and @xmath136 fitting  become inadequate .",
    "the position of the break between the non - linear and linear parts of the @xmath43sfr relation depends on the lf slope and its cut - off luminosity ( fig.[fig : lx - sfr - break ] , eq.[eq : abreak ] ) : @xmath137 .",
    "this allows to constrain the parameters of the luminosity distribution of compact sources using the data of spatially unresolved galaxies as discussed in section [ sec : lf_parameters ] .",
    "agreement of the predicted @xmath12sfr relation with the data both in high- and low - sfr regimes confirms the universality of the hmxb luminosity function , derived by @xcite from significantly fewer galaxies ( shown as crossed boxes ) than plotted in figs.[fig : lx - sfr ] , [ fig : lx - sfr - break ] .",
    "it provides an independent confirmation of the existence of a cut - off in the hmxb xlf at @xmath138 , including hmxbs in spatially unresolved high redshift galaxies from the hubble deep field north .",
    "this implies , in particular , that ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulx ) at redshifts of @xmath130 were not significantly more luminous than those observed in the nearby galaxies .",
    "x - ray flux from x - ray binaries is known to be variable in a broad range of time scales , from @xmath33msec to @xmath33 years .",
    "in addition to a number of coherent phenomena and quasi - periodic oscillations , significant continuum aperiodic variability is often observed .",
    "the fractional rms of aperiodic variations depends on the nature of the binary system and the spectral state of the x - ray source and is usually in the range from a fraction of a per cent to @xmath139 per cent . correspondingly , the combined emission of x - ray binaries in a galaxy should be also variable in a similarly broad range of time scales .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that due to a large difference in the characteristic time scales of the accretion flow onto a stellar mass object and onto a supermassive black hole variability of the x - ray emission from a galaxy can be used to distinguish between the combined emission of a population of x - ray binaries and that of an accreting supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy ( agn ) .    from results of section [ sec : variability ] and",
    "appendix [ sec : variability_ap ] one should expect that in the non - linear low - sfr regime the fractional @xmath44 of the total x - ray emission of a star forming galaxy is independent of sfr .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by the results of the monte - carlo simulations performed as described in section [ sec : variability ] and shown in fig.[fig : rms_hmxb ] . for moderate star formation rates , sfr@xmath140/yr",
    ", we predict a rather large aperiodic variability of the total emission of hmxbs at the level of @xmath141 of the fractional @xmath44 of individual x - ray binaries . at larger values of sfr ,",
    "corresponding to the linear regime in the @xmath12sfr relation , it decreases as @xmath142 , in accord with eq.([eq : rmstot_of_n_small_n ] ) .",
    "also shown in fig.[fig : rms_hmxb ] are values of the fractional @xmath44 reduction , computed directly from eq.([eq : rmstot ] ) using the luminosities of the observed hmxbs in the milky way @xcite , smc @xcite , and in the antennae galaxies @xcite .",
    "note , that the predicted @xmath143sfr relation can be modified by the luminosity dependence of the @xmath44 of individual sources .",
    "this factor might become especially important at large values of sfr when the total luminosity of a star forming galaxy is dominated by ulxs whose variability properties we know little about .      as the first chandra observations of compact sources in nearby galaxies became available , it has been noted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) that the luminosity of the brightest x - ray binary in a galaxy might depend on its properties .",
    "in particular in the case of high mass x - ray binaries it appeared to correlate with the star formation rate of the host galaxy .",
    "for example , in the antennae galaxies , a number of compact sources have been discovered with luminosities of @xmath144 erg / s @xcite . on the other hand , the luminosities of the brightest hmxb sources in the milky way do not exceed @xmath145 erg / s @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that this might reflect the difference in the intrinsic source properties , related to the difference in the galactic environment and in initial conditions for x - ray binary formation in starburst galaxies and in galaxies with weak and steady star formation .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ sec : prob_lmax ] , the probability distribution for the luminosity of the brightest source in a galaxy , @xmath106 , depends on the lf normalization , i.e. on the sfr of the host galaxy in the case of hmxbs .",
    "the luminosity of the brightest source increases with sfr , until it reaches the maximum possible value , defined by the high luminosity cut - off of the lf .",
    "the @xmath106 distributions , computed from eq.([eq : p_lmax ] ) for the parameters of the `` universal '' hmxb xlf , are shown for different values of sfr in the left panel of fig.[fig : lmax_hmxb ] .",
    "the right panel in fig.[fig : lmax_hmxb ] shows the dependence of the most probable value of the luminosity of the brightest hmxb on the sfr of the host galaxy , described by eq.([eq : lmax ] ) , along with its intrinsic 67% uncertainty .",
    "filled symbols in fig.[fig : lmax_hmxb ] are the luminosities of the brightest source observed in star forming galaxies from the sample of ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "as is clear from the plot , the large difference in the maximum luminosity between low- and high - sfr galaxies , e.g. between the milky way and the antennae galaxies , can be naturally understood in terms of the properties of the probability distribution @xmath106 .",
    "no additional physical processes , affecting hmxbs formation in starburst galaxies , need to be invoked .",
    "the hypothetical intermediate mass black holes , probably reaching masses of @xmath146 , might be produced , e.g. via black hole merges in dense stellar clusters , and can be associated with extremely high star formation rates . to accrete efficiently",
    "they should form close binary systems with normal stars or be located in dense molecular clouds .",
    "it is natural to expect , that such objects are significantly less frequent than @xmath33stellar mass black holes .",
    "the transition from @xmath33stellar mass bh hmxb to intermediate mass bhs should manifest itself as a step in the luminosity distribution of compact sources ( fig.[fig : imbh ] , left panel ) .",
    "if the cut - off in the hmxb xlf , observed at @xmath147 corresponds to the maximum possible luminosity of `` ordinary '' @xmath33stellar mass black holes and if at @xmath148 a population of hypothetical intermediate mass bhs emerges , it should lead to a drastic change in the slope of the @xmath43sfr relation at extreme values of sfr ( fig.[fig : imbh ] , right panel ) .",
    "therefore , observations of @xmath12sfr relation for distant star forming galaxies with very high sfr might be an easy way to probe the population of intermediate mass black holes .",
    "as was shown by @xcite the luminosity distribution of low mass x - ray binaries in nearby early type galaxies and bulges of spiral galaxies can be described by a `` universal '' xlf whose shape is approximately the same in different galaxies and whose normalization is proportional to the stellar mass of a galaxy .",
    "the shape of the `` universal '' lmxb xlf is significantly more complex than that of hmxbs .",
    "it appears to follow the @xmath149 power law at low luminosities , gradually steepens at @xmath150 , and has a rather abrupt cut - off at @xmath151 . in the @xmath152 luminosity range , it approximately follows a power law with the differential slope of @xmath153 .",
    "given the shape of the xlf , the total luminosity of lmxb sources in a galaxy is defined by the sources with @xmath154 , the contribution of the brighter and , especially , weaker sources being less significant .",
    "therefore the non - linear regime in the @xmath13 relation , although does exist for @xmath155 , is less important than in the @xmath12sfr relation for high mass x - ray binaries ( see , for example , fig.14 in @xcite ) .",
    "significantly more pronounced is the dependence of the luminosity of the brightest source on the lf normalization , i.e. on the stellar mass of the host galaxy . in order to study this dependence we used the broken power law approximation for the lmxb xlf from @xcite and performed a series of the monte - carlo simulations , similar to those described in section [ sec : variability ] .",
    "the probability distribution of the maximum luminosity @xmath106 , obtained from these simulations , is shown in the left panel in fig.[fig : lmax_lmxb ] for different values of the stellar mass of the host galaxy .",
    "the right panel shows the dependence of the most probable value of the maximum luminosity and of its 67% intrinsic spread on the stellar mass .",
    "its broken line shape is a result of the broken power law approximation of the lmxb xlf used in the simulations .",
    "solid symbols show the observed values of the maximum luminosity for the number of nearby early type galaxies , bulges of spiral galaxies and for lmxbs in the milky way from the sample of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "similarly to hmxbs in star forming galaxies it is obvious from fig.[fig : lmax_lmxb ] that the significant difference in the value of the luminosity of the brightest source can be naturally explained by the properties of the luminosity function of lmxbs .",
    "the same effect leads to an artificial ( unphysical ) dependence of the average luminosity of low mass x - ray binaries in a galaxy on its stellar mass ( e.g. fig.17 in @xcite ) .",
    "so far there is no evidence for a significant change of intrinsic properties of low mass x - ray binaries with galactic environment .",
    "the difference between the luminosity of the brightest lmxb in massive elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies can be understood based on the probability arguments .      as in the case of hmxbs , in the linear large - mass limit , @xmath156 , the fractional",
    "@xmath44 of the aperiodic variability of the combined emission of lmxbs follows the @xmath157 averaging law .",

    "the normalization of the luminosity function , i.e. the number of hmxbs in the galaxy @xmath2 , is proportional to its star formation rate .",
    "we showed that due to statistical properties of the probability distribution @xmath40 the result of a measurement of the total luminosity of a randomly chosen galaxy might deviate significantly from the intuitively obvious expression @xmath166 these properties of @xmath40 can result in a surprising non - linear dependence of the total luminosity on @xmath2 .",
