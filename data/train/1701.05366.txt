    "<S> common features observed in adf images of all samples ( fig .  [ tem_sto ] and  [ tem ] ) are 3d - ruddlesden - popper ( 3d - rp ) faults caused by an additional layer of lao over a small area - fraction of a layer . </S>",

    "<S> [ tem_sto]a & b and fig .  [ tem]a & c ) </S>",
    "<S> , the faulted volume is estimated to be less than 9  @xmath20 and 2  @xmath20 in the mbe and pld samples , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers are obtained by measuring the contour lengths of the rp faulted areas in all available images and normalizing them to the total image area .    </S>",
    "<S> the lao layers surrounding the fault in growth direction , i.e. , perpendicular to the substrate - film interface , are a consequence of the first additional atomic lao layer at the bottom of the shifted volume . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we also compared @xmath21 , defined as the lengths of the faults parallel to the substrate normalized to the total length of the image multiplied by the nominal , total number of lao layers ( 64 in the @xmath19 $ ] and 80 in the @xmath22 $ ] sls ) . in mbe samples , @xmath21 is less than 1% . for pld samples , @xmath21 is at least a factor of three smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> the obtained numbers reflect the la non - stoichiometry necessary to create the observed density of rp faults . despite the large volume of the shifted areas in the image , </S>",
    "<S> the change in stoichiometry indicated by one rp fault is very small because the adjustments in the cation ratio occur only at the edges of the shifted region . in pld growth </S>",
    "<S> the cation stoichiometry is predetermined macroscopically by the composition of the target . in mbe growth stoichiometry control </S>",
    "<S> takes place on the level of individual atomic layers and is therefore less accurate , hence a higher density of 3d - rp faults results .    at the substrate - film interface of samples grown on lsat ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tem]a - d ) , the images show a bright layer indicating the accumulation of heavier atoms in all samples . in the mbe samples , </S>",
    "<S> only one atomic layer right at the interface is affected whereas in the pld samples 2  3 layers appear brighter . </S>",
    "<S> a scenario where statistically distributed vacancies are filled with lanthanum or nickel appears very likely . </S>",
    "<S> lsat is a solid solution with statistical occupation of sr and la cations at a sites and al and ta on b cation sites of the perovskite abo@xmath0 structure , hence the termination of the substrate surface is chemically not well defined . during the mbe growth of the first atomic la layer </S>",
    "<S> the vacancies are filled resulting in one bright atomic layer . </S>",
    "<S> the extended bright region in the pld - grown sample can be understood if one takes into account that the energy of impinging particles is much higher , thus more atomic layers are affected .    </S>",
    "<S> the lower energy of the impinging particles and the atomic layer - by - layer growth are assumed to also lead to sharper lno - lao interfaces , and indeed , the mbe samples appear to have flatter interfaces than the pld samples . in order to visualize and quantify this observation , we extracted the ni , al , and la layer intensities through integrating over the area marked with a white box in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tem]a - d . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical analysis of the resulting intensity oscillations in stacking direction are shown in the panels below each adf image of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tem]a - d . </S>",
    "<S> while in the mbe samples about 75% of the layer stacks have the intended thickness , this is true for only about 50% in the pld - grown sls . the majority of the remaining layer stacks have either one layer less ( about 27% for pld- and 15% for mbe - grown sls ) or one layer extra ( about 12% for pld- and 6% for mbe - grown sls ) . whereas in pld - grown samples in average </S>",
    "<S> 18% of the layer stacks deviate by more than one layer in thickness , such strong variations of thickness were not found in mbe - samples . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers indicate that the variation of the layer thicknesses is clearly reduced for the mbe samples and that more layers have the intended thickness .    </S>",
    "<S> we now compare temperature dependent resistivity , hall carrier densities and hall mobility of nominally identical samples grown on lsat by the two different techniques , which were measured by standard four - point contact experiments ( fig .  [ carrier ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , the resistivity values of pld samples grown on lsat is higher and the mobility lower than those of their mbe counterparts ( see figure  [ carrier]a , b , d , e ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the low - temperature behavior of the samples with higher lno thickness deviates significantly which is reflected in a higher residual resistance ratio [ @xmath14(300k)/@xmath14(2k ) ] ( rrr ) for the mbe samples ( e.g. 5.3 vs. 3.7 for a pair of two @xmath19\\times 3 $ ] samples ) . a 25 u.c . </S>",
    "<S> thick film grown by mbe shows an rrr as high as 18.4 and a room temperature resistivity as low as 78  @xmath23ohmcm ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ carrier]a ) which is an improvement compared to previously reported data for both ceramic and thin film samples .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in contrast , the highest rrr found in a pld sample of the present study is 4.9 . </S>",
    "<S> these differences also become evident in the hall mobility of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ carrier]b & e and point to higher defect and/ or impurity density in the pld samples . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of 3d - rp faults in the mbe samples has a smaller impact on electrical transport . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by the fact that the faults rarely start at the sample - substrate interface but mostly after 16 unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the size of the shifted volume is larger than the mean free path of charge carriers determined for similar sls .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite finally , oxygen vacancies , whose density is hard to determine experimentally in thin films , can lead to a further increase of resistivity .    a dimensional crossover from a paramagnetic metallic state to a weakly insulating , antiferromagnetic </S>",
    "<S> state has been observed in lno - based sls and thin films on various substrates ,  @xcite and has been attributed to changes at the fermi level seen in photoemission .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite although the critical thickness below which these changes occur is under dispute , similar phenomena have been observed in all experiments , on ultra - thin films and sls alike .    </S>",
    "<S> transport data shown in fig .  [ carrier ] confirm the dimensional crossover . in accordance with literature data ,  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we observe a clear change in resistivity between 2 and 4 unit cell thick lno layers , while the variations are small for thicker lno layers . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is true for both pld- and mbe - grown samples , but only in mbe - grown samples the carrier density is strongly reduced ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ carrier]c ) simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> although lno possesses a large hole and small electron fermi surface , it is assumed that the main contribution to conductivity arises from holes , in agreement with field - dependent hall measurements showing a linear and positive slope .    in mbe samples , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature and thickness dependence of the carrier density is highly reproducible and systematically changing with the lno thickness , as shown with the additional data on similar or nominally identical samples ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ carrier]c , solid symbols compared with open symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is , in general , not the case for pld samples ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ carrier]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> pld samples do not show a clear trend of the carrier density with respect to the lno layer thickness . </S>",
    "<S> only the temperature dependence of a thick lno film resembles its mbe equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> local scale defects such as interface and surface roughness can reduce the effectively conducting thickness and lateral inhomogeneities render the current path more complex . </S>",
    "<S> these are possible reasons for the discrepancies between mbe and pld sls . for thick films interface and surface </S>",
    "<S> roughnesses play a minor role and as a consequence , the carrier density of such a thick film ( 63 u.c . ) </S>",
    "<S> agrees with a corresponding mbe sample ( 25 u.c . ) .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our comparative study of lno - lao sls grown by mbe and pld shows the opportunities and challenges of both methods and demonstrates the successful growth of perovskite oxide heterostructures . while the atomic layer - by - layer deposition in mbe yields on average sharper interfaces , the cation stoichiometry is more difficult to control . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the chemistry of the material , the deviations from stoichiometry can give rise to a complex microstructure , as demonstrated by the rp faults occurring in the lno layers of the mbe film . </S>",
    "<S> future work should focus on mitigating the stoichiometric variations in mbe growth and on transport measurements on samples with reduced lateral dimensions . </S>"
