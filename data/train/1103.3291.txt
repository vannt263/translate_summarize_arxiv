    "according to pauling scale f has electronegativity of 3.98 , which is higher than those of c(2.55 ) , h(2.20 ) and o(3.44 ) , and hence fluorination of graphene is expected to result in a material , which may be even more interesting than both graphene oxide and ch . before the first synthesis of graphene",
    ", fluorinated graphite has been treated theoretically .",
    "@xcite owing to promising properties revealed for ch , fluorinated graphene structures are now attracting considerable interest @xcite despite uncertainties in their chemical compositions and atomic structures .",
    "in an effort to identify the structures of fluorinated samples , previous theoretical models attempted to deduce the lowest energy structures .",
    "@xcite in addition , band gaps of different structures calculated within density functional theory ( dft ) are compared with the values revealed through specific measurements.@xcite however , neither the stability of proposed structures are questioned , nor underestimation of band gaps within dft has been a subject matter .",
    "raman spectrum by itself , has been limited in specifying c@xmath0f structures.@xcite    in this work , we first determined stable c@xmath0f structures for @xmath1 .",
    "then we revealed specific properties ( such as internal structural parameters , elastic constants , formation and binding energies , energy band gap and photoelectric threshold ) for those stable structures as signatures to identify the derivatives probed experimentally .",
    "we placed an emphasis on fully fluorinated graphene or fluorographene ( cf ) , in which d and g raman peaks of bare graphene disappear after long fluorination period.@xcite present study reveals that the properties , such as structural parameters , binding energy , band gap and phonon modes of various fluorinated structures are strongly dependent on the binding structure of f atoms and their composition .",
    "some of these properties are found to roughly scale with f coverage . while the stable c@xmath2f chair structure is metallic",
    ", cf is a nonmagnetic insulator with a band gap , @xmath3 , being much larger than 3 ev , i.e. a value attributed experimentally to fully fluorinated graphene . in view of the calculated diffusion constant , raman active modes and other properties",
    ", available experimental data suggest that domains ( or grains ) of various c@xmath0f structures with extended and imperfect grain boundaries can coexist after fluorination process .",
    "hence the measured properties are averaged from diverse perfect and imperfect regions .",
    "our predictions are obtained from first - principles plane wave calculations@xcite within dft , which is demonstrated to yield rather accurate results for carbon based materials .",
    "calculations are performed using spin - polarized local density approximation ( lda)@xcite and projector augmented wave ( paw ) potentials.@xcite kinetic energy cutoff @xmath4 for plane - wave basis set is taken as 500 ev . in the self - consistent potential and total energy calculations of fluorographene a set of ( 25x25x1 ) * k*-point sampling is used for brillouin zone ( bz ) integration .",
    "the convergence criterion of self consistent calculations for ionic relaxations is @xmath5 ev between two consecutive steps . by using the conjugate gradient method ,",
    "all atomic positions and unit cells are optimized until the atomic forces are less than 0.03 ev /  .",
    "pressures on the lattice unit cell are decreased to values less than 0.5 kbar .",
    "the energy band gap , which is usually underestimated in dft , is corrected by frequency - dependent gw@xmath6 calculations.@xcite in gw@xmath6 corrections screened coulomb potential , w , is kept fixed to initial dft value w@xmath6 and green s function , g , is iterated four times .",
    "various tests are performed regarding vacuum spacing , kinetic energy cut - off energy , number of bands , * k*-points and grid points .",
    "finally , the band gap of cf is found 7.49 ev after gw@xmath6 correction , which is carried out by using ( 12x12x1 ) * k*-points in bz , @xmath7     vacuum spacing , default cut - off potential for gw@xmath6 , 192 bands and 64 grid points .",
    "phonon frequencies and phonon eigenvectors are calculated using the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt).@xcite",
    "each carbon atom of graphene can bind only one f atom and through coverage ( or decoration ) of one or two sides of graphene , one can achieve diverse c@xmath8f structures .",
    "uniform f coverage is specified by @xmath9 ( namely one f adatom per @xmath10 c atoms ) , whereby @xmath11 corresponds to half fluorination and @xmath12 is fluorographene cf .",
    "the adsorption of a single f atom to graphene is precursor for fluorination .",
    "when placed at diverse sites of a @xmath13 supercell of graphene , simple f atom moves to the top site of a carbon atom and remains adsorbed there . for the resulting structure spin - polarized state ( with 0.4 bohr magneton ) is only 2 mev favorable than the nonmagnetic state .",
    "the binding energy of f is @xmath14=2.71 ev in equilibrium , that is a rather strong binding unlike many other adatoms adsorbed to graphene .",
    "an energy barrier , @xmath150.45 ev , occurs along its minimum energy migration path .",
    "our calculations related with the minimum energy path of a single f atom follow hexagons of underlying graphene .",
    "namely , f atom migrates from the highest binding energy site , i.e. top site ( on top of carbon atom ) to the next top site through bridge site ( bridge position between two adjacent carbon atoms of graphene ) .",
    "the corresponding diffusion constant for a single f atom , @xmath16 is calculated in terms of the lattice constant , @xmath17   and characteristic jump frequency @xmath1839 thz .",
    "experiments present evidences that energy barriers on the order of 0.5 ev would make the adatoms mobile.@xcite moreover , this energy barrier is further lowered even it is collapsed in the presence of a second f atom at the close proximity . consequently , this situation together with the tendency towards clustering favors that c@xmath0f grains ( or domains ) of different @xmath10 on graphene can form in the course of fluorination .",
    "we note that the energy barrier for the diffusion of a single carbon adatom adsorbed on the bridge sites of graphene was calculated to be in the similar energy range .",
    "carbon adatoms on graphene were found to be rather mobile .",

    "is , however , not excluded .",
    "for stable structures , the gap between optical and acoustical branches is collapsed , since the optical branches associated with the modes of c - f bonds occur at lower frequencies .",

    ", spectroscopy data is expected to yield significant information regarding the observed structures of fluorinated graphenes .",
    "the contour plots of the total charge density , @xmath48 , in the f - c - c - f plane suggests the formation of strong covalent c - c bonds from the bonding combination of two c-@xmath54 hybrid orbitals . the difference charge density , @xmath57 ( which is obtained by subtracting the charges of free c and free f atoms situated at their respective positions in cf ) , indicates charge transfer to the middle of c - c bond and to f atom , revealing the bond charge between c atoms and ionic character of c - f bond .",
    "however , the value of charge transfer is not unique , but diversifies among different methods of analysis.@xcite nevertheless , the direction of calculated charge transfer is in compliance with the pauling ionicity scale and is corroborated by calculated born effective charges , which have in - plane ( @xmath58 ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath59 ) components on c atoms , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and on f atoms @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "finally , we note that perfect cf is a nonmagnetic insulator .",
    "however , a single isolated f vacancy attains a net magnetic moment of 1 bohr magneton ( @xmath64 ) and localized defect states in the band gap .",
    "creation of an unpaired @xmath52- electron upon f vacancy is the source of magnetic moment .",
    "however , the exchange interaction between two f - vacancies calculated in a ( 7x7x1 ) supercell is found to be nonmagnetic for the first nearest neighbor distances due to spin pairings .",
    "similar to graphane,@xcite it is also possible to attain large magnetic moments on f - vacant domains in cf structures .",
    "having analyzed the stability of various c@xmath0f structures with @xmath651,2 and 4 , we next investigate their mechanical properties .",
    "the elastic properties of this structure can conveniently be characterized by its young s modulus and poison s ratio .",
    "however , the in - plane stiffness @xmath66 is known to be a better measure of the strength of single layer honeycomb structures , since the thickness of the layer @xmath67 can not be defined unambiguously . defining @xmath68 as the equilibrium area of a c@xmath0f structures , the in - plane stiffness",
    "is obtained as @xmath69 , in terms of strain energy @xmath70 and uniaxial strain @xmath71.@xcite the values of in - plane stiffness @xmath66 , and poisson s ratio @xmath72 , calculated for stable c@xmath0f structures are given in table  [ table ] together with the values calculated for graphene and graphane .",
    "for example , the calculated values of cf are @xmath66=250 j / m@xmath73 and @xmath72=0.14 .",
    "it is noted that @xmath66 increases with @xmath10 . for cf ( i.e. @xmath74 ) ,",
    "the in - plane stiffness is close to that calculated for ch .",
    "it appears that either the interaction between c - f bonds in cf ( or the interaction between c - h bonds in ch ) does not have significant contribution to the in - plane stiffness .",
    "the main effect occurs through dehybridization of @xmath39 bonds of graphene through the formation c - f bonds ( or c - h bonds ) .",
    "a value of young s modulus around 0.77 @xmath75 can be calculated by estimating the thickness of cf as @xmath67=3.84  , namely the sum of the thickness of graphene ( 3.35  ) and buckling , @xmath26 ( 0.49  ) .",
    "this value is smaller , but comparable with the value proposed for graphene , i.e. @xmath21 1 @xmath75 . here",
    "the contribution of c - f bonds to the thickness of cf is neglected , since the interaction between c - f bonds has only negligible effects on the strength of cf .    in fig .",

    "two critical strain values , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , are deduced .",
    "the first one , @xmath77 , is the point where the derivative curve attains its maximum value .",
    "this means that the structure can be expanded under smaller tension for higher values of strain .",
    "this point also corresponds to phonon instability@xcite where the longitudinal acoustic modes start to become imaginary for @xmath79 .",
    "the second critical point , @xmath78 @xmath80 ) , corresponds to the yielding point . until this point",
    "the honeycomb like structure is preserved , but beyond it the plastic deformation sets in .",
    "we note that for @xmath81 the system is actually in a metastable state , where the plastic deformation is delayed . under the long wavelength perturbations , vacancy defects and high ambient temperature @xmath78",
    "approaches to @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , our further molecular dynamics simulations show that @xmath82 0.17 at 300k and to 0.16 at 600k . in the presence of periodically repeating f - vacancy and c+f - divacancy , the value of @xmath78 is also lowered to 0.21 and 0.14 , respectively .",
    "apart from phonon instability occurring at high @xmath71 , the band gap is strongly affected under uniform expansion . in fig .",
    "[ figs5](b ) we show the variation of lda and @xmath83- corrected band gaps under uniform expansion .",
    "the lda gap slightly increases until @xmath84 and then decreases steadily with increasing @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath83-corrected band gap essentially decreases with increasing strain .",
    "for example , its value decreases by 38% for @xmath85 .",
    "present analysis of fluorinated graphenes shows that different c@xmath0f structures can form at different level of f coverage . calculated properties of these structures , such as lattice parameter , @xmath24 distance , band gap , density of states , work function , in plane stiffness @xmath66 , poisson s ratio and surface charge ,",
    "are shown to depend on @xmath10 or coverage @xmath41 .",
    "relevant data reported in various experiments do not appear to agree with the properties calculated any one of the stable c@xmath0f structures .",
    "this finding lets us to conclude that domains of various c@xmath0f structures can form in the course of the fluorination of graphene .",
    "therefore , the experimental data may reflect a weighted average of diverse c@xmath0f structures together with extended defects in grain boundaries . in this respect ,",
    "imaging of fluorinated graphene surfaces by scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy , as well as x - ray photoemission spectroscopy is expected to shed light on the puzzling inconsistency between theory and experiment .",
    "finally , our results show a wide range of interesting features of c@xmath0f structures .",
    "for example , a perfect cf structure as described in fig .  [ fig2 ] is a stiff , nonmagnetic wide band gap nanomaterial having substantial surface charge , but attains significant local magnetic moment through f - vacancy defects .",
    "moreover , unlike graphane , half fluorinated graphene with only one side fluorinated is found to be stable , which can be further functionalized by the adsorption of adatoms to other side .",
    "for example , hydrogen atoms adsorbed to other side attain positive charge and hence permanent transversal electric field , which can be utilized to engineer electronic properties .",
