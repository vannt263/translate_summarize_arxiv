    "in common language , a _ tipping point _ or _ critical transition _ is a sudden , large and irreversible change in output of a complex system in response to a small change of input .",
    "there have been a range of papers in the applied sciences that use the notion of a tipping point in applications such as climate systems @xcite or ecosystems @xcite .",
    "further work has attempted to find predictors or _",
    "early warning signals _ in terms of changes in noise properties near a tipping point @xcite , other recent work on tipping includes @xcite .",
    "indeed there is a large literature on catastrophe theory ( for example @xcite and references therein ) that addresses related questions in the setting of gradient systems .",
    "there seems to be no universally agreed rigorous mathematical definition of what a tipping point is , other than it is a type of bifurcation point , though this excludes both `` noise - induced ''  @xcite and `` rate - induced ''  @xcite transitions that have been implicated in this sort of phenomenon",
    ". other work on critical transitions includes for example  @xcite that examines the interaction of noise and bifurcation - related tipping in the framework of stochastically perturbed fast - slow systems . in an attempt to understand some of these issues , a recent paper @xcite classified tipping points into three distinct mechanisms : bifurcation - induced ( b - tipping ) , noise - induced ( n - tipping ) and rate - induced ( r - tipping ) . as noted in @xcite , a tipping point in a real non - autonomous system",
    "will typically be a mixture of these effects but even in idealized cases it is a challenge to come up with a mathematically rigorous and testable definition of `` tipping point '' .",
    "the aims of this paper are :    * to suggest some definitions for b - tipping and r - tipping appropriate for asymptotically constant `` parameter shifts '' in terms of pullback attractors for non - autonomous systems . * to show how these definitions allow us to exploit the bifurcation diagram of the associated autonomous ( i.e. quasi - static ) system to obtain a lot of information about b- and r - tipping of the non - autonomous system associated with a parameter shift . * to give some illustrative examples of properties that allow us to predict or rule out b- and r - tipping in various cases .",
    "restricting to simple attractors and asymptotically constant `` parameter shifts '' allows us to obtain a number of rigorous results for a natural class of non - stationary parameter changes that may be encountered in natural sciences and engineering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : defs ] we consider arbitrary dimensional non - autonomous systems and introduce a class of parameter shifts @xmath0 that represent smooth ( but not necessarily monotonic ) changes between asymptotic values @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for such parameter shifts ,",
    "we relate stability properties of branches of solutions in the autonomous system with fixed parameters to properties of local pullback point attractors of the non - autonomous system with time - varying parameters .",
    "this means that the systems we consider are asymptotically autonomous @xcite both in forward and backward time .",
    "after some discussion of ( local ) pullback attractors , we show in theorem  [ thm : pullback ] that one can associate a unique pullback point attractor with each linearly stable equilibrium @xmath3 for the past limit system ( i.e. the autonomous system with @xmath4 ) .",
    "then , we define two types of tracking : _ @xmath5-close tracking _ and _ end - point tracking_. we show in lemma  [ lem : pbtrack ] that if there is a stable branch of equilibria with no bifurcation points from this @xmath3 to some stable equilibrium @xmath6 for the future limit system ( i.e. the autonomous system with @xmath7 ) , then this unique pullback point attractor will @xmath5-closely track a path of stable equilibria for sufficiently slow rates",
    ".    on the other hand , there may be a number of stable paths connecting @xmath3 to @xmath6 - each of these with an image that is a union of stable branches , but possibly passing through bifurcation points . in this case , the pullback point attractor can clearly only track at most one of these paths .",
    "allowing arbitrarily small perturbations along the path , there will be pseudo - orbits that can track any stable path . in theorem  [ thm : adiabatic ]",
    "we give such result by stating necessary conditions for @xmath5-close tracking by pseudo - orbits .",
    "section  [ sec : brtipping ] gives some definitions for b- and r - tipping that correspond to lack of end - point tracking for parameter shifts . in that section",
    "we prove several results for one - dimensional systems , including the following :    * certain bifurcation diagrams or parameter ranges will not permit irreversible r - tipping ( theorem  [ thm : rtipping ] , case 1 . ) .",
    "* other bifurcation diagrams will give irreversible r - tipping for certain parameter shifts ( theorem  [ thm : rtipping ] , cases 2 . and 3 . ) .",
    "* there are restrictions on the regions in parameter space where irreversible r - tipping can occur ( section  [ sec : restrictions ] ) .",
    "these results use some properties of the paths of attractors .",
    "we introduce the notion of _ forward basin stability _ where at each point in time the basin of attraction of an attractor for the associated autonomous system contains all earlier attractors on the path .",
    "we prove that :    * forward basin stability guarantees tracking ( theorem  [ thm : rtipping ] case 1 . ) . *",
    "lack of forward basin stability , plus some additional assumptions , gives testable criteria for irreversible r - tipping ( theorem  [ thm : rtipping ] cases 2 . and 3 .",
    "we also give an example application to a class of global energy - balance climate models in section  [ sec : examples ] .    in section  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss some of the challenges to extend the rigorous results to higher - dimensional state or parameter spaces , to cases where noise is present and to parameter paths that are more general than parameter shifts .",
    "suppose we have a non - autonomous system of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the `` rate '' @xmath13 is fixed .",
    "for @xmath14 , @xmath15 and starting at @xmath16 we write @xmath17 to denote the _ solution cocycle _ @xcite , where @xmath18 is the corresponding solution of ( [ eq : ode ] ) .",
    "we also assume @xmath19 is defined for all @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and note that it satisfies a cocycle equation @xmath22 for any @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that , in addition to @xmath21 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 depends on the shape of the parameter shift @xmath28 , its rate of change @xmath29 , as well as on the function @xmath30 that defines the system .",
    "the key difference from the evolution operator of an autonomous system is that a cocycle depends on both the time elapsed @xmath31 and the initial time @xmath26 .    the model ( [ eq : ode ] )",
    "can be extended to include stochastic effects , e.g. by considering a stochastic differential equation of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents an @xmath34-dimensional wiener process and @xmath35 represents a noise amplitude .",
    "a random dynamical systems approach @xcite gives a solution cocycle that depends also on the choice of noise path .",
    "one can understand a lot about the asymptotic behaviour of ( [ eq : ode ] ) [ or ( [ eq : sde ] ) ] from the bifurcation / attractor diagram of the associated autonomous system @xmath36 where @xmath37 is fixed rather than time - dependent .",
    "general properties of dynamical systems suggest that if @xmath29 is `` small enough '' then we can expect , for an appropriate definition of attractor , that trajectories of ( [ eq : ode ] ) will closely track a branch of attractors of ( [ eq : odeaut ] ) if the branch continues to be linearly stable over the range of the varying @xmath37 . in this paper",
    "we consider only the case of linearly stable equilbrium attractors for ( [ eq : odeaut ] ) where such statements can be made rigorous through use of geometric singular perturbation theory @xcite or uniform hyperbolicity @xcite .",
    "the control theory literature discusses related questions ; see for example @xcite that allows @xmath28 to depend on state as well .",
    "however , close tracking of a continuous path that traverses several stable branches of ( [ eq : ode ] ) can not always be guaranteed , even if @xmath29 is small enough .",
    "if the variation of @xmath28 along a branch of attractors brings the system to a bifurcation point where no stable branches are nearby , we have the ingredients of a bifurcation - induced or b - tipping point ; no matter how slowly we change the parameter , there will be a sudden and irreversible change in the state of the system @xmath38 on , or near where the parameter passed through a dynamic bifurcation @xcite .",
    "however , b - tipping is not the only way to get a sudden irreversible change .",
    "even if there is a branch of attractors available for the system to track , a rate - induced tipping or r - tipping @xcite can occur ; if there is a critical value of the rate @xmath29 beyond which the system can not track the branch of attractors then it may suddenly move to a different state .",
    "this happens even though there is no loss of stability in the autonomous system .",
    "nonetheless , the bifurcation diagram of the associated autonomous system may give us a lot of information and indeed constraints on when r - tipping may or may not happen .",
    "nontrivial behaviour that can appear as a result has been recently studied in @xcite in terms of canard trajectories .",
    "we consider the behaviour of ( [ eq : ode ] ) for one dimensional ( @xmath39 ) `` parameter shifts '' , i.e. choices of @xmath40 that are @xmath41-smooth ( but not necessarily monotonic ) , bounded and satisfying @xmath42 that limit to the ends of the interval , @xmath43 as @xmath44 , where the limiting behaviour is asymptotically constant ( i.e. @xmath45 as @xmath46 ) .",
    "more precisely ,          the _ set of equilibria _ for the bifurcation diagram of ( [ eq : odeaut ] ) is @xmath52 writing @xmath53 to denote the linearization of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath38 , we identify the subsets of @xmath54 that are linearly _ stable _ , _ unstable _ and _ bifurcation equilibria _ : @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the spectrum of the matrix @xmath57 . note that , in addition to generic bifurcations , @xmath58 may include degenerate bifurcation points and even `` bifurcations '' that do not involve any topological change in the phase portrait , e.g. @xmath59 at @xmath60 .",
    "we say @xmath54 is _ regular _ if ( i ) the set of bifurcation points are isolated ( @xmath58 has no accumulation point ) and ( ii ) the only asymptotically stable recurrent sets ( attractors ) are equilibria .",
    "the first property of a regular @xmath54 is implied by the kupka - smale theorem for flows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 7.2.13 ) under generic assumptions , though our assumption is less restrictive and allows the possibility of high codimension bifurcations in @xmath58 .",
    "the second property of a regular @xmath54 holds for one - dimensional systems , but does not hold in general for higher dimensional systems .          given a parameter shift @xmath67",

    "a path can traverse several branches that meet at isolated points in @xmath58 , where the path may be nonsmooth .",
    "it may also traverse the same branch several times .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : lambdas ] , some @xmath40 can be monotonic functions of @xmath26 and visit each point on a branch at just one value of @xmath26 , others may have internal minima or maxima and visit the same point on a branch at more than one value of @xmath26 .",
    "we mention a minor result that we use in a later theorem .      *",
    "proof : * regularity of @xmath54 in particular means that there are no accumulations of bifurcation points @xmath58 .",
    "suppose that a stable path @xmath68 traverses an infinite number of smooth stable branches and hence passes through an infinite number of bifurcation points .",
    "as the path is continuous and bifurcation points are isolated on the path , there must be an accumulation as @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "however , as @xmath72 has well - defined end - points in these limits @xmath73 , one of @xmath74 is an accumulation point , which gives a contradiction .",
    "we are interested in the influence of parameter shifts @xmath75 and rates @xmath29 on pullback attractors of the non - autonomous system ( [ eq : ode ] ) .",
    "note that the limit @xmath76 is singular in the sense that @xmath77 does not exhibit any change in parameter values with time . in terms of the cocycle @xmath78",
